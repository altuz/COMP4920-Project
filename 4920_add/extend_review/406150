76561198069735211,Recommended,406150,32666359,Posted: 22 June,all,DaHotFuzz,"As most of the reviews have already described, Refunct is in fact about a 30 minute game but don't let the short length convince you to avoid it; the experience is fun and peaceful.  In a nutshell, the objective of the game is to go from one point to the next by jumping platform to platform.You know where to go by looking for a red button that emits a red light into the sky. You need to push this button in order to unlock the next path you go on.  It is very straightforward and once you get the hang of how the platforming works Refunct will feel sort of like a speedrun.The graphics are surprisingly pretty and there is even a day and night cycle.  The music could not be any more fitting as well.  It has an ambient electronic sound - I dig it.  Achievements are simple to get and only four so it's an easy 100% for the completionists out there. Overall the experience was worth the dollar I spent on it (Thank you Steam summer sale) and at that price, it won't disappoint.UPDATE: Quickly browsing through the game's forums I stumbled upon a guy who asked if it were possible to refund this game after completing it because of how short it was.  And the answser to that is of course you can refund it according to Steam's refund policy.. but the question is, WHY BE LIKE THAT? The game is only a few bucks and at this point in time during the summer sale it was knocked down to just under a buck.  Why ask for a refund on something so cheap AFTER completing it? The developer only probably makes 70 cents or so after Steam takes its cut anyway.  Let's have some decency by not essentially robbing developers like this please."

Perfectly describes the game actually. It wont take you long to finish (maybe 30-45 minutes), although if you go back to try and get to the top of every platform, perhaps a bit longer. The controls are seamless with the gamepad. I didnt try k/m, so no report on that.Really, just a nice experience, and the entire game coalesces into a cleverly constructed thank you at the end.I give it 8 rays of sunshine reflecting off of a placid lake of consciousness out of 10 possible."

That's kind of odd, really.For such a short game, it feels like a lot of thought went into it. Movement in the game is incredibly fluid, it teaches you the mechanics in smart ways, and the commentary provided by the achievement titles add a layer of wit and punchline to the experience. There isn't much more I can think to say about Refunct, other than to express disappointment that any first-person shooter I play after this is going to feel incredibly restrictive in comparison.The only real complaint I have about the game is technical (although fairly significant): the sensitivity in the game is ridiculously low. I maxed out the sensitivity in the game settings, and still had to fiddle with my mouse to double the DPI before the game felt right. Oh, and why is Shift used instead of LCtrl?"

,Recommended,406150,31491799,Posted: 1 May,all,DeepFriedOreo,"Just bought and beat this game in 30 minutes, and I have to say it was entirely worth it. The gameplay is very simple on the surface, but the clever use of slightly advanced platform mechanics, not to complete the game, but to get a 100% adds a little extra spice for more advanced platform gamers which does feel more satisfying than I had originally though it might. Not to mention after I got my 100% I spent a few minutes just jumping around listening to the music, I didn't want to close the game.As short and sweet as the game itself, if what you're looking for is to spend a small amount of time just having some fun jumping around listening to a mesmerizing soundtrack with some pleasantly surprising quirks, this is a great experience."

It's a game for people who saw the length involved and immediately thought ""Oh thank god."" It's for people who don't want to commit their time or money to anything better or worse.So it's a hard one to review.I played it when I was very tired and didn't want to invest my time in anything better or worse. So I liked it. If that is not exactly what you want, then move on.It's not a boring game, it manages to combine crouch-sliding and walljumping mechanics into it's very short collectathon package to keep things fresh. New mechanics, platform-types and such are introduced regularly, and finding some of the actual collectables (although the bulk of the collectathon work is just stepping on platforms) requires figuring out stuff like using momentum.There's a simple day/night cycle, it cycles through 3 or 4 BGM tracks, and the entire game is over and 100%'d in about 20 minutes. Add in another 40 for card idling because that's Steam now I guess.""Thank you""-ending messageRefunct is not a bad game on the very short, very unambitious merits it aspires to.No, there's no real value for money here. No, it isn't going to win any awards. No, it won't be the first game that comes to mind when thinking about anything, not even very short relaxing games for tired people.Refunct is for tired people who want to play 20 minutes with a fairly mediocre, but undemanding and not boring, mechanically-oriented game.$3 could fetch you a hotwater bottle/heat pack.

A very nice prototype, but a prototype nonetheless.  I got 100% in 20 minutes. And yes, length isn't everything, I've played some FANTASTIC 60 minute games, but they had something that really stood out. This is just all-around nice, but has nothing big, no punchlines, nothing new. I really, REALLY want to see where this guy is going, but I don't think that this product, as it is, is worth spending money on.I feel very conflicted about this review, really. I'm posting it as a negative not to chastise the developer, but to encourage them to go bigger with whatever they do next.Edit: It turns out that this guy has previously made a very similar game with more mechanics to it that looks quite fun (called Refunktion), and has been developing various things for years. It's honestly a little disappointing that he's selling Refunct for three bucks when he can clearly do better than this."
,Not Recommended,406150,22561436,"Posted: 21 April, 2016",all,Deimorz,"To be clear, nothing about this game isbad. The visuals are pleasant, the soundtrack is nice, and it controls decently enough.But I can't honestly say that I would recommend playing it. There aren't any particularly imaginative mechanics, there's no challenge, and there's no story at all. It doesn't even have the inherent motivation of ""I want to solve the puzzles"", because it's always immediately obvious how to do the next section. You're just going to spend about 25 minutes making simple jumps between platforms to step on some buttons and collect some cubes, and then you'll be done with it (but you'll still need to leave it idling for several hours if you want to get the trading cards).Overall, I feel like this is the skeleton of a game. The developers could definitely take what they've created here, expand on it, and build it into a high-quality, interesting game. But Refunct is a lot closer to a prototype than it is to that hypothetical game."

You can jump and wall-jump, you collect little box thingies, paint platforms green by stepping on them and you push buttons to unlock new areas of the level. that's about it. But while you don't have a lot of mechanics to work with, the ones you have are just well implemented and enjoyable. And the soundtrack is very relaxing and just suits the gameplay well. I had a very nice hour of gameplay with it (probably more like 45 minutes, considering I had a lengthy cigarette break ^^) and completed it 100%.

,Recommended,406150,31871780,Posted: 20 May,all,D0wnies,"TL;DR - Refunct is an odd game. Not odd implying it is bad, but not implying it is great either. If you have the additional funds to buy this game, buy it.Gameplay/Story - It is a First-person puzzle game. Quite similar to games like Mirrors Edge, but with no story. The movements are very fluid and works well. You go around pressing red buttons while jumping on every platform. You have free rain on an ever-expanding 'island', chasing after those red buttons, while also having the side objective to collecting cubes (which have no impact on gameplay, or the 'ending', but are there for the achievements).Graphics - The game is beautiful. Nothing more, nothing less. It should run well on all rigs, and it isn't demanding.Length - While playing Refunct, it was very enjoyable, and I was under the impression that this was just one level of a few, increasing the playtime and repeatability of the game, but it isn't. It is a game which is like a ""One and done"" game, where some players may come back after a while to refresh their memory about the game. The whole game takes like 20-30 minutes total, and it is a pleasurable 20-30 minutes, but it leaves you wanting more but doesn't have more to offer.Achievements - The majority of players playing/buying this game may be due to achievement hunting aspect, and for that reason, it is quite easy to 100%.Overall - If you have the additional funds after buying the games/etc. you want, buy Refunct. I would not make buying Refunct a ""Number 1. Priority"", but an afterthought. The game is great fun but lacks the length and replayability aspects."

,Recommended,406150,23987894,"Posted: 1 July, 2016",all,Audish,"Refunct is a game about jumping on things. Set in a seemingly endless expanse of calm ocean, you hop around blocks and pillars protruding from the water. Landing on a block changes it from white to earth and grass hues, restoring color to the world as you scramble about looking for buttons to produce more landscape.If that was it, there wouldn't be much reason to play Refunct. However, there's an impressive level of artistry at work beneath the simplistic surface. As you play the game introduces you to additional mobility options in a very natural way, ditching tutorials in favor of intelligently designed challenges that help you uncover new techniques yourself. Exploring these options will also lead you to collectible cubes hidden around the map, and another side of the world that is haunting in its beauty.That gets to the heart of Refunct's appeal, because the atmosphere in the game is unexpectedly rich. The minimalist landscape is cold and stark, but grows steadily more inviting both as you fill in color and as the sun rises over the ocean. You'll see the shadows grow short and the colors become crisp, along with the soundtrack reaching an uplifting swell. Details like this make the game an engrossing joy to play, and though the end comes in about 20-30 minutes it is so charming you can't help but love it. Refunct is an absolute pleasure to play, from tight controls to gorgeous presentation, that I can recommend it to anyone without reservation.Did you enjoy this review? I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope you'll check out more of them athttps://goldplatedgames.com/or on mycuration page!"
,Recommended,406150,29263627,Posted: 14 January,all,wizcreations,"Refunct is an extremely short (30-minute) casual platformer.  Your goal is to reach a number of red buttons spread across the world.  Pressing a button will cause additional pieces of land to rise out of the water, which will contain additional buttons for you to reach.  If you choose to pursue 100% completion, the game also has a number of small cubes hidden throughout the world for you to find.You essentially have the ability to move, jump, and slide, though there are some special ways you can use those movements in order to progress the game.  For example, you may not realize you can swim until the game forces you to dive underwater for the first time.  You will also quickly learn that you can wall jump and misuse some of the special platforms spread throughout the map to gain additional altitude.Most platformer games I have seen and played tend to focus on some combination of speedruns, high difficulty, and complex level design.  Although Refunct does have an avid speedrunner community, the game breaks the norm of platformers and instead creates an experience anyone can play, completely free of frustration.  This is a refreshing change! Everything about this game is enjoyable.  Night and day smoothly transition as you play the game, the music is peaceful and encouraging, there is no story to get in the way of the experience and no tutorial to bog you down with instructions, and effort was clearly made to make the game look beautiful everywhere you turn.I can see myself deleting my save file to play this again.  I really enjoyed the experience, and it's short enough that it can provide a relaxing and enjoyable break from whatever stress life (or other video games) throws your way.

Your task, well I guess that's up to you ultimately. You can restore color the the pads by stepping on them. There are beacons attached to buttons that when depressed reveal more of the world. There are collectibles that can prove, I don't want to say difficult but may take some thinking on how to traverse to reach them.The game feels extremely fluid. It reminds me Mirrors Edge without the mechanics of momentum or the visceral awareness of where your characters limbs are. You can wall jump, climb (near on edge) and swim.The OST is also superb and lends itself well to the ethereal location you'll find yourself in. Its sort of mindless. In a good way. It feels good mechanically, its very aesthetically pleasing. It indeed encourages your mind to wander about. What I found refreshing while “ponderous exploration evoking existentialism” is certainly becoming a trope in indie titles. This one isn't pretentious about it. It lets you go there if you want and get lost in the atmosphere or you can just run around and collect the things, making sure to hit all the platforms.THE GISTVery enjoyable little experience, a very nice palette cleanser and one I obviously recommend.Follow my curation for more"

It's simple, smooth, and cutesy and doesn't promise more than it delivers. I also really liked how the game does not have to explain how certain mechanics work or what you are supposed to do. Nevertheless, the game is too one-dimensional in my opinion. The entire game consists of a repetition of the same puzzle using the same mechanic. There is no story, no meaning, and the world itself is also highly stylized. The ending is just that - it ends, nothing more. Conclusion: the game is very bland, and I felt disappointed by it."

Let's see...There's wall jumping,There's power sliding,There's entering into tubes,There's pretty fireworks at the end.Seriously the only thing missing is an unlockable Yoshi, and a cake baking princess.The game will take you 30 minutes if you intend to get all the achievements which requires you to find the hidden collectible cubes and to change all the platforms in the world to green by jumping on them. The world of platforms slowly unlock raising out of the sea each time you find and step on a red target button. Eventually after you have stepped on all 37 of them, the world will be complete and take the shape of a meaningful symbol between you and the developer.The game though short lived, has longevity especially to those interested in speed running. It's basically a parkour playground which will require you to master some special moves like super jumps, elongated power slides and corner and edge jumping to say the least. There used to be an achievement where the developer wanted you to complete the whole course in 4 minutes. I assume the achievement was removed because of being buggy, but whatever the reason I highly recommend that you try and do this. You will get much more fun out of the game, by challenging yourself and it's definitely doable.I myself was very proud of the fact that i got this game which originally took me 30 minutes down to 3 minutes 28 seconds. I was so proud. Then I watched the world record of 2 minutes and 46 seconds and realised how much i must suck at gaming. Though there are no words in the world of refunct, this short game taught me humility.Congratulations to the developerhttps://sites.google.com/site/dgrieshofer/homewho has aimed to produce a relatively stress free playground for all ages. It proves that violence and death is not needed to have fun.Below is my run for the game followed by the WR. Try it for yourself and see how you go! Can you get it in under 4 minutes?

Despite being short it seems like the devs put a lot of thought into it (the background sort of made me assume it was part of the future parts of the game but it wasn't lol).The game doesn't take very long to finish and in my opinion it's definitely worth the full price. It has beautiful but simple graphics and doesn't try too hard. Simple mechanics, not a steep learning curve and it doesn't take long to figure out, get used to and master the parkour.If you get really stressed out, this game is a really good stress reliever and it's extremely peaceful with no pressure. The music is also well suited and also very beautiful. I'm not so sure about the day and night cycle, it doesn't really add anything but it also doesn't really obstruct anything - the environment is always very well lit up and visibility is excellent.The game is simple and easy for anyone as well as extremely fun. The game and mechanics are really... fluid and smooth which is extremely exciting and refreshing.The only things you really need to worry about are setting the sensitivity higher (mine was at 200%)because the at first, the sensitivity is simple awful to play withand that you can wall jump by pressing space everytime you reach a wallwhich took me a while to find out (I accidentally found out).

The developers do allow a seperate purchase of the sound track for $3, which I think is a great deal! I will give you one hint, because I started over the game 3 times when I was confused about how to get through certain areas. This game DOES have a wall jump. Its an extremely important mechanic and one that speedrunners use to get through the game more quickly. This game is fun, and a great romp.

(I was afk for a while, so my playtime is longer.)In short, you jump and walljump from one platform to another, turning their concrete surface to grass (an easy and effective way to track your progress). You reach a checkpoint, and more platforms appear in the distance for you to reach and convert to grass. And on and on. Plus some items to collect. That's about it and it sounds boring to read, but it's so well done, relaxing and that muuuuuuuusic, that you enjoy it throughout.I definitely recommend it. So very simple, so very enjoyable. The music, again, is utterly lovely. I'd pay for the soundtrack. The two endings (you can see both, one for reaching the final platform and one for 100% completion) are cute and will make you smile.PS. As a totally absolutely amateur game designer / developer, this game also makes me happy because it's such a great example of a ""first game"" that's well done, keeping things simple and managing a great job of it.

I only found out about the game thanks to the Steam Queue.Cons- None really, even though it is pretty short I felt like it is just long enough to make you feel super happy without pointlessly dragging on.- Steam related - you will have to sit around for like 2 hours before you start getting Steam cards. This is related to Steam's policy against refund abuse on cheap games. You might as well play it again, it is pretty fun.I would really like to see more games like this, you should definitely get it.10/10 would let a yellow platform shoot me up into the sky again :)"

The aim is simple: recolour all the blocks by landing on their tops and see whether you can complete it 100%.The game is very short (I completed it in 50 minutes and I typically take twice as long as the average for game completion) but it's only a tiny price and makes for a fun distraction."

Sadly it's short, very short and once you're done there's no extra levels or anything else to do unless you want to go through it again: more levels or a way to randomize the area you play in'd have been a great addition.Even as things stand Refunct is a game worth playing for the experience it's able to provide, it's good, fun and easily accessible by people of all ages and skill: just be mindful of its short length and get it on sale if possible."

The goal of the game is to use your acrobatic abilities to reach red buttons that when stepped on, cause new pillars to shoot out of the ocean and add further complexity to your surroundings.  Calming techno music plays in the background while your character effortlessly navigates this surreal setting of endless ocean and setting suns with grace and fluidity; jumping off of walls and climbing ledges with pleasingly little hassle.As each pillar platform is stepped upon, it changes from a cold, stone slab to earth and grass.  You literally leave your mark on the world and grow its intricacies out as you progress; making your playground bigger and prettier with each little victory.  It gives the game a journey and driving force that is distilled down to the simplest of acts, almost like a gardener tending his land.  You get caught up in it and before you know it, you've finished the game in a single sitting, which only takes about 30 minutes.  A fittingly short journey for a simple but effective concept, and a ton of fun while it lasts."

And it'll only take about an hour more than that to complete everything.It's one concept level and it's price accordingly. Refunct shines precisely because it doesn't try to be anything more than it is: a first-person puzzle platformer.I normally hate speed run achievements, but here I enjoyed them because they seemed very doable with only a little practice, and also because they helped the experience by getting replayability out of the same assets. Much like Mirror's Edge, I had to completely rethink my pathing in order to pull it off. The precise execution was much less important, which is as it should be.Grab Refunct if you feel like jumping and climbing around for a bit. It's good for games to be short sometimes."

,Recommended,406150,18517638,"Posted: 16 October, 2015",all,fungusdude4,"Refunct is a simple little 3D platformer that just wants you to have fun. You begin by rising from the sea along with a small island of square platforms. The map expands as you find buttons to bring more platforms up from the water. It's sort of like a growing playground of angular islands and towers and it's rather cool to see the world form around you. You can even dive below the surface to see all the islands lying in wait. Along with the buttons, you can try to color all the platforms by touching them or find scattered pickups to boost your completion percentage. The controls are fairly basic. You can jump, climb, crouch, and slide.  The climbing mechanic is very welcome, since it eliminates those frustrating, barely-missed jumps by allowing you to pull yourself up onto a plaform. Wall-jumping also becomes important later, but the slide maneuver is rarely used.The graphics are refreshing and minimal,  crisp and colorful with some nice lighting effects. Unfortunately, some of the effects can be blurry and inconsistent since you'll be whipping the camera around a lot. The music is pretty upbeat and sometimes ethereal. It's very well done, probably worth a soundtrack purchase. Refunct is certainly nice to look at and listen to.The platforming is, for better or worse, generally simple and easy. There are some tricky jumps, but they usually spare you the trial and error. Refunct is fast-paced and won't take you long to complete, but you could do multiple playthroughs or just run around for fun. The game is also very polished. I barely encountered any bugs or gameplay issues. The experience is modestly priced and easily enjoyable. Give it a go if you want to lay back and have some casual jumping fun."

Since I had some spare money in the wallet after buying all my 'big' games this sale, I decided to give it a go. It didn't cost much and had 'overwhelmingly positive' reviews, too, which drew me in. I'm not a big fan of platformers, but this seemed interesting enough to warrant a try.I'm glad I did. It's really lightweight and even on my 'meh' laptop, it ran on all ultra settings pretty smoothly. I think my favourite part of the game has to be its music. It fits the atmosphere perfectly, and really contributed to my enjoyment of the game - at a few points, it seemed like the soundtrack knew exactly what was in my mind. There was one moment where I was ramping up to do a jump and the music dropped the bass right when I fell. It wasamazingto experience.Another major plus is the way the dev managed to teach me the controls without a single word of text. There were a few situations I was lead into where I had to figure a way out, and I managed to do that just by experimenting. That led to a huge amount of satisfaction and sense of accomplishment for me.The whole gimmick of turning dead things alive is also really cute, with great SFX and a lovely ending! I'll definitely be playing this again just to experience it multiple times.Definitely would recommend, it's worth your money and your half an hour. <3"

Throughout this game there also collectivles which you collect to get the steam achievements. All of this sounds pretty typical.Why I immediately went to review this game after buying and finishing it is that it's just a great experience.

The main reason being that is all it is: A game. It is not trying to tell an overly dramatic story. It is not trying to be a political soapbox for the developer. It is nothing but a wonderfully crafted game.Refunct starts off giving you about 5 white platforms that when you step on turn green and, after stepping on the first red button, takes you on an amazing journey of First Person Plaforming. I played on mouse and keyboard and can honestly say that the controls were as smooth as butter. The only complaint I can think of is having a slider for aim sensitivity rather than clicks of 10%.This also Is one of the few games were the soundtrack is something I would gladly listen to while playing the game. By this I mean in many games I listen to the soundtrack for a full loop and then use my own music. The music for this game matches the asthetic and feel of the game so well it would be a crime to not litsen to it as you platform your way from start to finsh.Refunct doesn't deserve to be rated on a whatever-out-of-ten scale because it is that damn good (but if i had to it is a 10/10). I wish I could give the dev more money, even though it will take you max 1 & 1/2 hours to beat.Really the main tragedy with Refunct is that a small minority of people will play the and beat it in less than 2 hours and, likely, refund it."

This is a calming first-person platformer, distilled down to its most basic elements. If you've played many platformers before, you'll probably fly through (and probably enjoy it). There is no guidance, so if you truly haven't played any platformers before, I could envision some spots where you might not be able to figure out what to do next. I'm usually a keyboard and mouse guy, but I used the Xbox360 controller for the whole thing, very comfortably. The challenge level was casual and forgiving; there were a few tricky manuevers but overall this was about discovery and progress rather than challenge or incredibly difficult jumps.I bought it on sale for around $1.50. I feel OK about that price for this relatively short, but overall fun experience.I think this is a great fit for ""grown-up gamers"", who are looking for quick, high quality experiences but don't necessarily have time for grinding, extended exploration, complicated custom controls schemes, and other time-filling mechanics."

The only thing I have to compain about is the mouse sensitivity, but that isn't incredibly bad once you get used to it.The game is well worth the money, and is very easy to 100% complete (there are floating cubes in easy-to-somewhat-tricky places - there were two that seemed impossible, but the hint is: use physics).It's a super chill version of Mirror's Edge, as there is a lot of parkour involved. It is extremely cool and, again, the only two problems with this is the mouse sensitivity, and how short it is. If you're into this style of gameplay and need 30 minutes to burn/chill out, this is your game.Edit:  I thought I might add that I felt slightly nauseous after playing. Mind you, readers, that I am extremely sensitive to Field of View variations and movement effects when it comes to movement-heavy games, but if you're like me, you may feel slight discomfort after or during your runthrough."

You can do stuff like slide, walljump etc. There are no enemies in the game. The game is also short. The first time I played it I took 46 minutes to complete it. The game is geared towards speedrunner and the game lets you know how long you took to complete it. This is the games biggest draw. I completed this game 6 times and got my completion time down to 16 minutes. I will play it again to try for an even faster time. The devs also decided that the played doesn't need a model, which I think is great. There are no animations because of this. Nothings slows down the parkour. For a 3$ game this is a must buy."

THE MUSIC!?!?!I have a lot of anxiety problems. So much so that sometimes i've gone through a period in my life when the slightest inconvenience or difficulty sent me into a spiral of self-depreciation, self-hatred and occasionally suicidal thoughts. While that is long behind me, this game is still very important.I've seen another game about having anxiety attacks, I don't remember what it's called, something about proper breathing, finding flowers, that's a good game for understanding the fundamentals of what it's like.this game however, this isn't an explanation, it's something that just takes it all away. It's so relaxing, beautiful with it's eternal horizons, sunsets, sunrises, shadows, high views, underwater views, the music is perfect for this kind of game to just hop into and relax, run around and lose yourself for a few hours.Until I found this game, I often played Undertale when I needed some stress relief, or to just have a nice, happy, therapeutic, faith-in-humanity kind of game. And while I would wager that Undertale still gives a more potent feeling in that regard, this game does it on such a short iteration time, with near equal payout. As of writing this review, I have one hour logged on this game, and have beaten it three times.If I could make/add on thing to this game, it might be the ability to switch music tracks from the peaceful track we have, to a more upbeat one, a congratulatory track, and just several different kinds of positivity to make you feel even better when you're already in certain moodsTL;DR It's short, it's cheap, it's a great stress reliever, and can last you a LONG time if you have frequent anxiety/stress attacks.

I think I can sum this game up quickly for you guys.You know, I've been looking for the ultimate gaming parkour experience for a while. I am not the biggest fan of some of the more popular ones, and well, some of the others are just not polished enough. I've pretty much given up. Until I played this game.First thing that caught my attention was the smoothness. The controls are responsive and intuitive, not much more to say here. The soundtrack is obviously a huge part of an experience that is meant to be ""calming"", ""soothing"" and it indeed is astounding. When it comes to gameplay, I enjoyed every minute of it. It is a simple parkour game, where your objective is to collect cubes, press buttons and paint the world into a bright colourful place. Simple, right? Indeed and that's the part of it. Also, the game teaches you new mechanics in such a nonchalant, not-forced way that it does not break your experience. Believe me, tutorials or guides are not needed.If there's one group of people (besides everyone who likes calm and short games) I'd recommend this short masterpiece to, it is actually people who suffer from anxieties and depressions. As weird as it sounds, the achievements pose important questions perhaps worth answering. And, most of all, this game has the potential to give you a little happiness into your life, thanks to its beautiful simplicity. Please, play it. I ended up in tears (and yes, I am highly sentimental)."

There was never a moment of frustration or annoyance. I came out the other side without a care that I was less a dollar.

It's a ridiculous joy to move around Refunct, whether you're barrelling around looking for switches or methodically exploring for the collectibles. Additional layers are organically built up around the basic movement mechanics of jump & slide, encouraging you to change up how you move around.The world unfolds naturally, both mechanically and very literally, and the collectible items all enforce this idea of using combinations of platforming mechanics to get to them. The look of the world itself is simple and blocky, but given a high degree of visual polish through the use of choice lighting effects, bathing wherever you go in this beautiful haze of colour. There's a day-night cycle too, so it evolves throughout the time you spend there, accompanied by a downplayed but still emotional electronic score.It's short, yes, but its also as long as it needs to be. It could have been bloated or otherwise artificially-lengthened, but as is, it ramps up to a satisfying ending with a cute payoff - and basically, you need to see it for yourself. An excellent way to spend half an hour."

Refunct is about jumping from platform to another in order to return their colors and activating switches that make more platforms rise from the water.Pros:Pleasant colorsSimple controlsRelaxingThe change between day and nightThe hidden achievements' names are questions which encouraged at least me to think the answerThe ending is quite niceGetting to some of the platforms challenged my mindI could play this over 60 FPS with V-sync off with my Nvidia GTX 960M on the highest settingsTakes little space (of course, it's a small game)Cons:Mouse sensitivity was not very good and thus controlling the perspective was difficult; therefore I highly recommend you to use a gamepad when playing this!Mouse sensitivity cannot be changed from the settingsNo actual story or even instructions what to do; I knew what to do only because I read the game's description here on SteamTl;Dr? (You can't be serious if you didn't read the text there. It's just 157 words, I checked it on Word) Here's a summary:Refunct is a very short game that is played in an hour. I recommend using a gamepad when playing this because of the poor mouse sensitivity. I liked the idea and the layout of this game and recommend you to buy it on a sale like I did. :)"

No doubt about it, I would say this is one of my favorite games of all time. The one and only complaint I have which is very little is, sometimes I had seemed to glide off of platforms but even with that it may have been my fault and it does not happen often nor does it take away from the experience.Overall this game is amazing and you should get it, espcially while it's on sale.Rating: 9.5/10"

Most of the sections simply require basic jumping from platform to platform with little difficulty, though later some wall jumping and basic use of jump pads is required. There are also some collectable red blocks hidden throughout the play area, though mostly in obvious and easy to reach locations.Refunct isn't bad by any means, but it just feels like an early proof-of-concept demo for something else.

In my opinion, what I played should have been the first level out of ten from a bigger and progressively harder game.Understand me well, I don't say it was a bad experience, the game is nicely optimized, but I don't get the point of it. I might sound harsh, but this game could be summarized into a small kind of post you see on social medias by compiling the sentences of the achievements together on a heart-shaped background. Though love is invaluable and self-questioning is a good way to find inner-peace and meanings, and the fact that I dream of a world without war where everybody would tolerate others beings, I'm reviewing the game and purely as a game I cannot recommend it.

I recommend doing one of those other things instead, but if this sounds like your idea of a good time you probably won't be disappointed.After my first several minutes withRefunctit struck me as a cross betweenMirror's EdgeandQ*bert.  As I bounced from platform to platform in the first person to change its color I was discouraged by the distinct lack of parkour mechanics.  However the evolving landscape guided me toward discovering the parkour mechanics just beneath the surface of the gameplay and not only was I pleased with this extra layer of depth, but I was also impressed with how the game design revealed the game mechanics.From then on, interacting with various features of the environment to reach the next chunk of the level passed without event.  I was apprehensive about missing a jump and landing in the water until again the evolving environment dumped me in the water and I realized that my character could swim.  That was a relief.  Then the sky began to darken and I was filled with a sense of dread in anticipation of the monsters that invariably come out at night, but night passed without incident.  I came to enjoy sundown inRefunctbecause I liked how the shadows lengthened and moved across the world.After 32 minutes I had 99%ed the game.Refunctis everything it is advertised to be: it is short, it is colorful, and it is peaceful.  Peaceful however is not necessarily soothing or relaxing.  The colors of the world do not make for draw dropping visuals.  The short length of the experience isn't a strike against it, either.  It's a short, low-pressure romp through a colorful environment, and that is it."

On completion, I was launched into the sky and saw that the island I had created resembled a heart with the words 'THANK YOU'  written under it. I was perplexed by how unsatisfying and silly this whole sequence was and I legitimately believed that this was a red herring so I continued onwards collecting all the red cubes and activating all the panels. I was rewarded with an underwhelming fireworks display. Now, I should mention that the music is quite enjoyable and atmospheric HOWEVER even that doesn't gel particularly well with the flow of the game. The pace of your game doesn't change but the music is constantly shifting tonally, which results in an odd disconnect from the world It almost felt like I was listening to an album outside of my game.

Maybe it's just not my type of game, but Refunct managed to bore me during 20 minutes I spent in the game to 100% it. What other people found relaxing, I found boring and underwhelming. What other people found as a great design and beautiful assets, I found to be more like a product of someone messing around with a new engine, trying to write something simple to learn its basics.I know I'm being a little harsh, but that were my feelings when the game ended after really underwhelming 20 minutes. As I said, it's probably just not my type of game - I really enjoy being challenged by the games and when I think of Refunct, the somewhat similar game that comes to mind is DeadCore. Similar in gameplay, but when you read negative reviews for DeadCore, they are the opposite of what is praised in Refunct. DeadCore is accused of being too hard, aimed only for an audience of hardcore FPS speedrunners. Despite not being FPS speedrunner, I really liked DeadCore, because it was really engaging and challenging. Refunct, on the other hand, just feel dull.TL;DR:I'm writing this review mainly to warn some people that it just might be not for them.

It lasts for about half an hour and barely anything happens. You start the game and nearly all the mechanics in the game are already there. There is barely any variation in the gameplay and i frankly dont really see the point. Although the freerunning mechanics where pretty good it was no mirrors edge or assassins creed. The graphics where kind of ok but they where very boring and once again no variation with probably about 5 textures all up or something. The music was quite pleasant but i thought it sounded kind of out of place after a while. Over all if you have got some time to spare and you can buy it for 50 cents then it is quite a relaxing experience. but let me tell you I expected more when i bought it without reading into what the game was about. 4/10

The reason it was a short game was because there wasn't enough challenge. It was essentially jumping from block to block.All in all, it's a good game to get for cheap. However, don't expect much.

The presentation doesn't attack you in any way, but rather sits and shows to me a lovely little world of cubes and pipes and buttons that I want to run across, to explore, to awaken. In the little time that I've had with Refunct, I've had multiple moments where I just... lose myself. No hard thoughts about how to make that jump, no worries about the consequences of failure, I justgo.And after a few minutes, I realize that I've just been running around without a care, wrapped in the game's embrace, enjoying the world. And I'm okay with that.It's quite small, mind you. I've reached peak enjoyment in under an hour of gameplay; maybe I'll go back and learn to speedrun it, like it seems to be made for.

I truly enjoyed this game, and even bought it for two close friends of mine. However, as of late the developer has added speedrunning timers and achievements to the game, completly removing the atmosphere they did such an amazing job of creating, and fans spoke so highly of. Because of this I've requested a refund and can no longer recommend the game, especially as the dev has brushed off fans discontent with the changes with 'if you don't like it ignore it', which is by no means a proper rebuttle."

I bought this game on sale for about a buck, but I'm writing this review taking the $3 price tag in mind. To put it simply... this game was too short, and I don't feel like it needed to be! It wasn't quite long enough to justify $3.Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the gameplay and the idea. It was very relaxing and fun to hop all over the place, but after 15 minutes I had already beaten the game and felt kind of let down by it's lack of replayability. They could have added more of the same and it would have at least had replay value, or added slight variations or a time attack mode... but it doesn't have that. You just beat it once and that's it, nothing changes. For this to truly be a relaxation game it has to be something I can jump into and play over and over again when I want to relax, but that only works well if it's not the same exact map/challenge every time you play.If you don't mind paying the $3 for a game that's only going to last about a half hour then you should buy this! It's actually quite fun! But if you expected something that keeps you coming back for more then I do not recommend this. I do hope to see more games like this in the future, or perhaps a free expansion to what already is.Also, I may be biased because I played way too much Half-Life 1 and I'm sort of a jumping god. The game felt like it was supposed to be harder but I already had a really good handle on the mechanics before I started."

,Recommended,406150,28929722,Posted: 1 January,all,Vholst,"Quick Bit- It delivers on its promise of being short and sweet with a lot of heart at its core for a small price's worth of a quick and enjoyable jump-about.Extra Bit- It's surprising how much is jam-packed into this little game that allows the player to fully enjoy the game at their own pace without handholding you through it all. That lack of handholding is in of itself a blessing; while a more experienced player will pick up the individual mechanics associated with your average jumping game quickly, newcomers will come into their own through experimentation that comes from the gradual escalating difficulty. This becomes more apparent given the range of skill required as it progresses, building on top of itself if you're inclined to turn the whole world vibrant and collect all of the cubes. The game doesn't force feed information to you, it just comes naturally with the revealing architecture and is a testament of good game design. Only downside to this is having to know how to crouch, which is relegated to a key not often used for such a command, by is of a minor annoyance.While not requiring deft skill to surmount the challenge, it's nice that it does add in enough to make someone, who doesn't play games regularly, feel like they've accomplished a goal in short order; a gateway game to others that add on more complex mechanics. That, added with the pleasant art design and solid soundtrack (which can be found in thisDiscussion Post), makes for a simple, lovely time. As an added bonus, there's always the option to speed-run the game for added depth, on your end of course. While you may not get a lot of mileage out ofRefunct, it's a simple title with a good price that's worth the play-through, if only to just enjoy what it has to offer.I will provide additional details, if requested for, in the comment section of the review."

It's certainly enjoyable, whatever you want to call it.For $3 it's not the greatest value IMO, but if you're looking for a pretty location to run (and jump, slide, hop, swim, and get launched) around in for under an hour and with basically no constraints; then Refunct fits that bill perfectly.It's worth checking out purely for the visual experience, and the feel of freedom as you move around. This is a parkour game that's more than just a jumping puzzle, but not as technical or punishing as, say, Mirror's Edge.If you want that deeper technical challenge though, apparently there's a speedrunning community for this game... which actually makes a lot of sense, given that the base game is so simple there's a lot of room to bring your own tricks and techniques together.I nearly didn't play Refunct because I'm not generally a fan of platformers. It was the clean, stylized blocky look which sold me in the end; I just had to have a go at exploring that world. I'm glad I took the plunge, because Refunct lived up to expectations.Final verdict: if you're an experience collector, Refunct is a great experience and worth trying. For anyone else, if you see it on sale then grab it and enjoy it for the ~30 mins that it offers at a casual inspection. Considering the price, I'd take Refunct over a cup of coffee -- they have about the same lifespan, but you can get a good coffee anywhere, while an experience like Refunct is harder to find."

It's a game where the main goal is to be relaxing instead of challenging which it does acomplish however it forgets what separates a good platformer from a great one. A great platformer is rewarding while still presenting a challenge to the player. Refunct doesn't do this. The game is far to short (beat it in 17 minutes) to even make the rewarding feeling even close to the realm of reality. Another thing that makes a great platformer is that the platforming comes first. Refunct brings a wall jump ability that is hardly used to get to the objectives and a cliff grab that makes the platforming too easy. The last ability is a slide that is used to slide under 3 areas to hit a objective point and to enter pipes that really don't fit the game that well and are only there to be there. There also is boost pads that just serve to add more verticality to the game without adding a actual challenge. The game focuses far to much on the music which is great but forgets the fundamentals of a platformer. There is no way to lose, which going back to my first point doesn't allow for any rewarding feeling to exist as there is nothing to overcome. The game has no story and the only objective is to turn the ground green by steping on a platform and to hit all the buttons while unlocking ""new"" areas every button you press. Overall Refunt is a shallow platformer with weak mechanics, no re-play value, no challenge, and nothing of substance. It may have great soundtrack but that doesn't mean much when the game around the soundtrack is mediocre at best.I would give Refunct a 4.5/10 -Infinite"

""Well done for doing what you were meant to do, have a gold star"". And the achievement names... ""What makes you, you?"".

Basically, you make your way across platforms hitting switches which unlock more platforms, while trying to make sure you touch all the platforms at least once. I would love to see some expansions for this with new courses, since the basic premise has so much room for growth -- I liked the way it introduced new ways of using the course, but there was so much more you could do with them, plus so many more potential ideas -- what about an ice level where you can get up speed to jump further, but also slide where you land? What about a course that's all uphill, getting progressively higher and making falling a bigger risk? So much potential! (This is also the type of game that's ripe for community-sourced courses.)

If the game featured more than one level and lasted more than 25 minutes to 100% I would of rated this game favorably. If you really want to find something like this game with hundreds of hours of replayability just go get the latest Counter Strike game and look for custom maps called KZ maps(Kreedz). It costs nothing more than a copy of CSGO, Source, or 1.6 and you will find thousands of maps available on counter strike*EDIT*I think people saw me write Counter Strike and were like ""Refunct isn't an FPS, ♥♥♥♥ off with your♥♥♥♥♥♥review."" Well I'll explain a little more in-depth about the custom mapping in Counter Strike. The KZ maps in Counter Strike are First Person platformers withNo ShootingNo KillingNo FightingFocus on reaching a finish line.Each map is roughly the same size as the entirety of Refunct and is available at no additional cost to the base game.

However, one day I was feeling pretty gloomy and tired. I decided to buy this game for about 2 dollars from a sale to give it a go. It met my expectations not only as perfectly as I had thought it could hold, but even added to it. The nurturing music, the vibrant lands, the skillfull thinking - it inherits it all. You're not simply trying to chill out with some nice brain music and wander the beautiful lands they give you - you try to make it complete and restore it.You are, well, you. As you wander through the map you'll have to complete little 'missions', and by that I mean reaching a certain destination put out with a beacon flare. As you walk and run and jump and crouch towards your objective, as you do that, you change the rocky lands into grass lands. Every block must be covered to make a complete 100% (you can track it by hitting the pause menu, aka esc.) and if you collect every red-glowing block, you'll be met with 4 achievements as of March 16, 2017 - amazing quotes and expressions to really press you down and melt you. It will make you think for a second, think back and reflect on the world. It will put your body into a state of paralysis. You will die of the thought alone. Once you get used to the game, it becomes simple. A game of exploring the lands, while at the same time saving it; with your present being a nice little expression x4.What I'm saying is this game is truly amazing. All of the graphics and details put into this game are beautiful. For a 2015 game, it's extraordinary. I'm so surprised it hasn't dazzled the market as of yet. It puts skillful thinking, mind-blown experiences, adventuristic quests, depression relieving sensation, and chill-out hardcore to the next level - - - and packed into one game. I love this game. Good work, developers. Buy this now. You will NOT regret it, that I promise you. I can't go into more, I can't physically add as many words as I may have to describe this game off. I will die trying. But please, buy this game if you're tired, gloomy, or simply depressed. Maybe you have depression - and maybe, you just found your online cure. Thank you for listening."

I pretended I was raising Atlantis from the seabed and that the red cube collectables were artifacts from those long lost beneath the waves. Made sense to me anyway. Perhaps a dark sequel where you are raising R'lyeh to release Cthulhu would be pretty cool?

It drops you in without any explanation and you kind of just fumble around until you understand what's going on. It teaches you the physics and controls without a single bit of tutorial. I love that in games. Finding the achievements was very easy, aside from getting to them. Some of them you couldn't get right away, you had to wait until later in the game to reach it.There are some of the graphics I'd like to see improved like the particle and stream effects in the completion surprise.

It's not very long - it can be finished in as little as 30 minutes - but it's a must for people who prefer some abstraction in their games.All that you do is jump from area to area as you raise a city, or really a collection of pillars and platforms, from the ocean depths. It's easy to start and gets progressively more difficult but not to the point of being annoying. There is no story but for something like this a story isn't really necessary. The graphics are gorgeous with a continual day/night loop and the electronic music is very soothing and atmospheric.This game isn't going to be to everyone's liking, and people who complain if a game doesn't last more than a few hours (fools that they are) probably should stay away. But if you like atmospheric games and light platforming/parkouring, you could do a lot worse than to throw a few dollars, Euros, or whatever at this indie game."

Very frustrating.Pros:Very comfortable, minimal 3D platformer.  I don't usually like first-person platformers but this game was (like Portal and Portal 2) very comfortable to jump around in.Lovely atmosphere - the game is minimal but still has a feel of its own.  I enjoyed the ending (which was also minimal).Cons:This game has huge unrealised potential.  It is cheap and it is worth the price, but it is so frustrating to see a successful concept that doesn't realise its full potential.  What would it take to do that?  A few more levels and a couple more gizmos in addition to the elevators/pipes(under-ulitised)/bounce plates.  Maybe a few weeks of development time and this game would be 10x better.  I completed the game in 50 minutes - this game could easily supply four or five times that length with minimal investment.Bottom line: Worth the cost, but you might be left frustrated by what this game could have been, but isn't."

Refunct is a clever first-person platformer where you, as the player, find yourself stranded on a group of blocks in the middle of the ocean.  You will need to parkour across these blocks to reach a visible destination point; upon doing so, more blocks will rise out of the ocean to join the existing landmass and a new destination point will be set for you.  Repeat this process until you've finished the game.It's fun for what it's worth.

It's a stem of an ambient platformer.What really harms the experience for me is the two collectibles that a first-time player will miss 99% of the time.

The puzzles are not too complex, but yet intriguing enough. I appreciate how the game is crafted in such a manner where minimal guidance if not none is needed, most mechanics are understood through intuitive means. Bring the player up to speed with relative ease, and helps to build confidence. Puzzles are not dead fixed as well, given freedom of mobility and maneuverability, there can be multiple way to reach the next checkpoint.Ambience is great as well. Soothing ambient music coupled with simplistic layout is a great combo. I like how each tiles turns green, it allows easy navigation through the map, in one glance, you will be able to distinguish between newly raised tiles and travelled ones.I have no qualms about this, i think this is an awesome game priced right.

The platforming is a bit unintuitive at first; your character will climp up the edge so sometimes you can make a jump despite it seeming like you can't make the jump. The elevator/lift mechanic actually adds to your jump height if you jump whilst it is moving. Knowledge of this is never clearly presented to the player and it is not required to complete the game (though it is required to complete the achievements).You'll get used to the somewhat-clumsy platforming, and if you've read this, you'll know about the elevators. Putting those aside, Refunct is a brilliantly designed feel-good platformer. It teaches you almost (see above) all of its mechanics incredibly intuitively. There are no text prompts though you might need to visit the controls page to find there is no sprint, and there is a crouch. The way Refunct teaches the controls is what modern game and interaction designers strive for.Coloring in all the platforms by being on them was unexpectedly fulfilling and the ending put a smile on my face. The soundtrack is relaxing and fits the feel of exploration and wonder that I feel Refunct is trying to evoke.The features listed on Refunct's store page are all accurate and not just hype.I would definitely recommend this game to anyone."

The level (there's only one!) unfolds as you successfully platform to the top of various rising towers.The platforming overall is very forgiving and fun, and I found myself creating challenges for myself as I went: ""I bet I can get all of those grey platforms to green without touching the water at this part..."" and ""I think I can get to that button without dropping below my current platform height...should be challenging, but if I walljump there...""It's short, it's beautiful, and it only takes about 15-20 minutes tops. And that's awesome. Not every game has to be a 130-hour epic RPG with incredible player investment and growth.

I adore it.Refunct is a chill trip, if you don't expect too much from it. That being said I don't have enough nice things to say about the game.You have a very simple goal with easy to grasp mechanics the game merely suggests to you. There is no tutorial and the only text is in the form of acheivments. When you first drop into the world, the game kinda just lets you do your thing. Traverse at your own pace. Make what you want of it.I've been looking for a nice simple game I can play without any big time commitment. This is that game. Finished it in less than 20 minutes, and thats fine. It left me feeling satisfied and refreshed.Theres nothing magical going on here, its just really laid back.This is no ""walking simulator."" Despite the lack of narrative, this still feels like a game instead of just druging around from point to point. Flow is also an importnat aspect of the game. You are really encouraged to approach things from every angle. With your small skillset, movement feels really great.I have only 2 gripes with the game. First being it is a little TOO short. I say that only considering hte price. Up to you if you want to pay 3$ (or 1.50 on sale) for 20-30 min. Surely a game this simple would have been easy to expand 2 or 3 times. The other grip is the game just barely feels bare bones. Obviously this is what the developer was going for but I couldnt shake the feeling this kind of feels like a test.Still despite those things, its an easy game to love. Maybe not for everybody, but its a nice change of pace.A very enjoyable experience overall. Try it if you have been looking for something chill."

What I didn't expect was such a smooth, succinct, and fun game. Refunct only takes 20 or 30 minutes to beat, and it plays out sort of like a snappier Mirror's Edge on some geometric platforms over water. The goal is to press buttons and collect the non-descript collectibles and as you progress, the game intuitively teaches you more of your movement controls as you try to get to the next button. Ultimately, this game is very cheap, just $3 when not on sale, and it gets you a fun, abstract experience with tight controls in the time it would take you to watch an episode of It's Always Sunny on Netflix.

The fact that there aren't any death traps or enemies makes this all the more enjoyable to me.Overall this is a short, extremely sweet game, and very well worth the time and money spent playing it. The entire time I was just filled with wonder and joy, and even mistakes, while still somewhat frustrating as most mistakes are, mostly just made me laugh. I'll definitely be replaying this many times in the future, especially when I need cheering up.

However the best thing is, the system requirements aren't overly demanding so some people that have a budget computer may still be able to experience the game to its full potential. Tbh, you'll have to play it yourself to perhaps know what it felt like to me and many others who have reviewed this game positively. I also recommend getting this game on sales (like any other game) if you still aren't confident in purchasing games like these."

Its also very relaxing, so you can play this without having to put much mind-power into it. The only negative I can really think of is that the achievements are few and very easy to obtain; making more achievements with more of a challenge in mind would add to replay value."

As you progress more of the island emerges and you'll face minor intuitive challenges here and there while building your little oasis.Graphically it is minimalistic but very beautiful.The soundtrack is pleasing and seems to just seamlessly meld into the experience.I played this game by my lonesome for what I thought would be 30 minutes of hopscotch to pass a bit of time and, surely enough, the gameplay largely consisted of that. What caught me off guard was just how much I was enjoying myself. So much so that the little achievements, that are quite easy to unlock none of which are out of the way of normal gameplay, had got me thinking seriously about, well, what gives me pleasure in life.It may not have the same effect on you, but this game has definitely had an impact on me, and for such a bargain price. The journey was over quick and I may not play it again for awhile, but I suspect I will one day. Hopefully if or when I need reminding that pure enjoyment need not be complicated at all."

This game is absolutely fantastic and for those 20-30 mintues you will forget all your worries and everything else. I can't recommend this game enough and just in case the devs come across this review, thank you so much."

The whole atmosphere might be odd at first but it's easy to adjust to - you can quickly start enjoying your brief stay in the world of Refunct.It's not bad at all. For a sale price like $0.98, it actually surprised me with how decent it was. The idea of it is pretty simple and I think that's where the fact you can't hate it comes from. There's nothing to be expected but running and jumping and you do just that. There are collectibles around the map and you obviously have the many red buttons all over the place. Some sections required a bit of thinking and I found that checking the controls and seeing what you could do helped me out.Achievement-wise it's a tad too easy.  There's only four to get in the game which isn't much. One playthrough will more than likely be enough to get them all.  Even though the game is simplistic in nature, I'm sure you could fit at least one or two more in there. I don't see why the developers couldn't.In the end, Refunct is a decent title to have in your collection and a way to get an easy badge. I don't know if you would want to pay $2.99 for it but it's up to you, after all."

It does, however, have little replay value (apart from the achievements or speedrunning attempts) and only lasts for half an hour of gameplay, so don't buy it expecting a game like Mirror's Edge or Skyrim, or you'll just be disappointed.

It also lasts only 30 minutes and there are no external incentives for going back to play through the game again.

This would make it much more enjoyable.Also another type of unlock you could add would be streaks that follow you and show the path you've taken for the last few seconds.Maybe you could spend the cubes you collect on things in gameOr something that would be real cool would be statistics to see how many cubes you've collected and how many times you've completed the game.But hey, Ideas aside this game is fun."

This fit the bill perfectly since all you have to do is jump from platform to platform, chasing spotlights.When you get to the final light (it's yellow so you know it's the last one) you're done.  There are minor challenges that make you think through a way to proceed, but once you realize you can climb walls by jumping back and forth the way Jackie Chan does in the movies the challenges are not too difficult.  I like that the game is as fast as you want it to be, or as slow.  You can take all the time you need without penalty.  There's no reading, no voices to listen to and understand, no secret upgrades required to move forward - it's just straightforward jumping from platform to platform with gently increasing difficulty as you complete all the steps to finish the game.  This game is very suitable for people that cannot hear but you must have good wrists.  My left wrist ached by the time I finished because of all the WASD spacebar use, some of it intense while you repeatedly try to climb a difficult wall.    I paid 99 cents, I think.  For 99 cents, how can you go wrong?"

,Recommended,406150,32850319,Posted: 27 June,all,Spaghetti Monster,"Let's take a look at Refunct shall we?Where it shinesWhen playing Refunct, I had a great first experience. The game has a really good atmosphere and the tunes compliment the graphics well for such a small indie title. The concept of the game is that you are running and climbing across these diferent platforms, all to reach the next button. to restore further of a vibrant colorless world. It's a really unique concept and one with great potential and loads of fun. There's pretty much no story to the game yet still I find myself willingly hopping from platform to platform simply because of how awesome it is. once you have fully restored the world by coloring ever tile and restoring every bit of the level, you'll be rewarded with the ability to paint it what ever color you likePitfalls/ConsNOTE:This game is in it's VERY early stages meaning that there is probably still loads to come for it. Anyways, let's take a look at some slighty worse things though rather insignificant for a game that costs 3€ and iscurrently on sale for less that 1.As cool as the game concept is and the amount of potential for this game, it is not utilized very well. Don't get me wrong, it was a pleasant experience and loads of fun... While it lasted. There's only one level in this game and after going through it 3 or 4 times i find the game to be without a goal other than repeating something over and over again, trying to shave times off a highscore. The game needs more content. The concept and mechanics in that one level are amazing and that's not what I'm complaining about here. What I think this game needs is more levels. More stuff to play through because it's such an awesome concept and it's sad that it doesn't span that long.What will then happen in the future for this game? Perhaps a story? Workshop level creation? Who knows.For now, and for what this game is my verdict is:8/10It plays with a really neat concept. It just needs to expand it more and make the game last more.I think it's pricetag is fair for what it is and the playtime you got from this is still worth more to me that buying some snacks or something like that.So from me, Refunct get's a big yes"

Each platform is grey, and get's coloured in when you manage to land on it. Your primary objective is to find and  hit a big red button. This will cause the next series of parkour platforms to rise from the waters, holding the next red button.There are also a few collectibles to find, in the form of small, red cubes.

Worth your time and money, already looking for games like it.Longer version: Visuals are delightfully minimalist without coming off as artsy or cheap.  Controls are simple as they come, with movement being just floaty enough to make the experience surreal without being outright annoying.  If there's a story to be had from this game, it's up to the player to find it and puzzle out what, if anything, it means.Personally, I found the whole experience to be meditative and calming, while also giving me the simplistic joy of discovery.  Also, there's no failure state, meaning zero stress.Buy it, play it, enjoy life."

ESPECIALLY in teaching the player how to move around. It teaches with no words, but in such a short amount of time (5 - 10 min into playing which is important considering the short game time) you know everything you can do just by playing the game.It slowly turns from a linear platformer to a varied platforming playground in all directions, with very very good design in how the game unfolds itself. Every level mechanic communicates what there is to do next, no messages, and with just mechanics you can get out every bit of content from this wonderful game.Jumping around is just FUN. If you like Mirrors Edge you will like this platforming. Nothing is between you and the controls. You just ""do"" it. This game is a prime example of what ""clear"" controls and mechanics are and what they feel like. It doesn't pad anything out, and every second spent is worth every penny."

Even if it wasn't meant to be cathartic, I could see it having some success by being used in such a way. I appreciate the lack of any instruction whatsoever, as it lets the player really immerse themselves in the gameworld. I especially like the challenge of having to figure out the things such as wall jumping, diving, etc. I purchased the game on sale for 1.08$ but I would not bat an eye at paying well beyond the regular price. I ran through it twice, as I was sad to see it end so soon. Simply amazing and I was incredibly lucky to have stumbled upon this game. I would absolutely love an update.

You know that game you played as a kid where the black tiles were lava and you had to avoid stepping on them? This is kind of the opposite of that - there are some gray blocks you want to jump on to give them color. But deeper than the mechanics of the video game is the actual game itself: jumping up on blocks, making more blocks appear, then jumping on those. It's an absurd concept, and not many modern games could create an experience around a premise as simple as this. But Refunct does it, and it does it without cynicism, condescension or aggrandizing itself. The result is awesome: a short, fun game you'll enjoy playing and come out better for.It reminds me of the first Super Mario Bros: It drops into a world and lets you figure it out. Like SMB, it makes figuring things out simple, natural, and rewarding. It doesn't hold your hand like most modern games and give you on screen instructions, but it also doesn't give you a big middle finger - it strikes that very difficult balance between guiding you and letting you go off on your own - like a dad teaching his kid to ride a bike. The game offers almost constant encouragement, but subtly and through the game itself, rather than a message from the developers showing up on the screen.Just a refreshing and enjoyable experience. Perfectly sized, priced well, and beautiful. A well made game."

The mechanics - walljumping, superjumps (which are something you know if you speedrun Refunct), pulling yourself up - are the most fun mechanics I've ever had the chance to play with. And, as I mentioned before, it's a great speedrunning game. The world record for this game is, at the time of writing, 2:47.77. My best time after a couple of weeks is 3:08.59.

Does a nice job of slowly ramping up the challenge and the mechanics you need to use to progress. Never gets intense, but you're not going to sleepwalk through this either unless you're pretty hardcore. It's a very short experience, but I think it was about the right length for the simplicity—if it had gone on too much longer, it would have either become repetitive or had to start layering on complexity that it didn't really need. That said, given a complete playthrough takes less than 45 minutes, I would definitely wait till it's on sale."

Personally, I prefer games that keep it short and sweet, but I know length is a thing for some people.But inIt's a really fun game -- walk around the world, step on buttons to unlock the next section of the stage. It's simple.  But it gets a lot of things right that indie games often screw up. First off, you move quickly. Too often in these exploration games, you walk slow. Second, the controls are simple. Once you know where you want to go, you can get there without fighting the mechanics.This is especially true once you get the ability to wall jump. Too often, you have to fight with precise timing. In this game, it knows you're trying to wall jump, and it just lets you wall jump,Finally, it lets you know where you want to go. The ""plot"" buttons send up a giant red beam. The ""achievement"" collectible boxes send out a subtler red glow.This was a great game for me, when I've been too busy at work and I just wanted a quick diversion."

That is done by getting to the highest point and push a button, which unlocks more. There is no story explained in the game. The game feels like an alpha, because of how short the game is. It's clear to see it is build around a speedrunner.  I bought it for 3€, which is pretty expensive for a 20 minute game. This game is too similar to his older project Refunktion. It has the same core mechanics, just with enenies.GraphicsThe graphics are minimalistic and it works for what is is. It has vibriant colors, which seems to draw a lot of inspiration from the Super Mario Games.

The soundtrack is very pieceful and relaxing.VerdictThe game is a lot of fun and an excellent time filler. It has a lot of potential, but the game is too short to really explore this.

Other people here are saying that it would've been great if there was more to it, and that's true, but I think without some additional layer to it, we would get tired of just hip-hopping around pretty quickly, I'd say around the hour mark. I feel like this is about as long as the game was intended to be as it is.As much as I like it, the thrift in me says get it on sale, but frankly you don't have to wait for a big one.

I completed the game twice, back-to-back, and 100%'d it with all achievements each time. When you know what you're doing, you can go for speed runs as the game gives you clear time when you finish.If you're not a speed run fan, then not to worry: the game doesn't display a clear time until you finish, and it's quite relaxing. The game is visually rather simple and peaceful-looking, with a soft electronic soundtrack that was very enjoyable.The jist of the game is you touch cement-looking platforms on water, they get brown on the sides with grass on top, and you hop on buttons to trigger more platforms to raise up out of the water until you've raised all of them. Bonus objectives for achievements include collecting several easily found floating cubes, and making every platform grassy, both of which I found to be very easy if you are anal about it from start to finish, and know that if you jump near the top of the rise on a yellow elevator platform, you can go a bit higher to get one tough-to-acquire cube.This game is very relaxing, from its visuals to its gameplay, to its soundtrack which I really enjoyed. If you want a challenge, then there is virtually none here, save for competing for good speed run times. I was shooting for 100% completion on my second run, and finished in just over 13 minutes...and I'm pretty terrible at going quickly, too! I definitely recommend this game, at least on a sale if you want cheap, short fun."

,Recommended,406150,31815544,Posted: 17 May,all,AirTightLawyer,wonderful indie game that really makes the non-completionist feel like they have spent a successful 30+ minutes turning stone into grass. 10/10 would buy again

76561198050822902,Recommended,406150,31832849,Posted: 18 May,all,torakalmighty,"Great platformer, good music, and the mechanics are simple but effective.  The lack of a tutorial makes you try new things when you're stuck, and you'll usually learn a new trick in the end.  With one map, this is kind of a one-and-done, but for $3, a great experience, and trading cards, it's worth the money.  It's what a platformer should be.If you're looking for more of a challenge, the developer made a similar game called Refunction.  It's more stealth based and he's giving out for free.Here's the link to his website:https://sites.google.com/site/dgrieshofer/home"

Feels like a prototype for a game rather than a complete one. Got all achievements in about 30 minutes, but it was worth it and I'll be replaying it again at some point in the future when I need to unwind."

It's inexpensive and imminently accessible, so if you have like an hour to spare and just want a chill, casual experience then this is a great choice.  Nothing about this game is stunning, it's casual in every respect."
,Recommended,406150,31614556,Posted: 7 May,all,Foxy,"Simple, short, yet stunning.My first playthough was one of those few moments bringing back the child like feeling of wonder. The platformer mechanics are easy to grasp and clearing the game takes only around 15-20 minutes. The game does have replayability value through self imposed challenges, though, and here are a few.1. Speed run2. No splashing3. Never stop moving forward"

A minimalist game, with a lovely soundtrack provides a relaxing playthrough which leaves you happy upon completion. I think it's definately worth a playthrough."
,Recommended,406150,31596886,Posted: 6 May,all,TheRawSushi,"This game is one of my favorite games of all time. Great graphics, relaxing and parkour. The end at 99% is very frustrating, but it is way worth the money and if you want to start over you can. I wish there was different maps on this,but for 3 dollars, one of my FAVORITE games of all time."

,Recommended,406150,31782207,Posted: 15 May,all,feeneyomega,An utterly charming and peaceful game with just the right level of difficulty and a seamless blend of mechnics that evolve organically. Would I play it again? Maybe not. Was it work every single penny I spent on it? Definitely.
