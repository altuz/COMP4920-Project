Why does it still feel so incomplete?The character models need some serious work, and crafting is rather awkward.It's like they took The Forest and cross-bred it with a cheap korean F2P MMO. I'm not a fan.As of right now, it's not worth the half price. The visuals need to be replaced and it's not obvious where you get most of the materials."

Think The Forest** without crazed, mutant tree jumping cannibals.Think instead.. somewhat crazed, strange aliens, some who live here anyway.. and some sucked here like you and your companions via a vortex.Dont get used to the companions.. they dont hang around long.. as in just long enough to get you started.. then.. well things happen.Unless your playing in Survival Mode, which is you tending to a wounded comrade and trying to survive.. the only difference between the two is that instead of looking out for yourself.. your looking out for him also.  I advise you dont start in that mode. I did and it does not include the helpful advice that Story Mode does.Graphics wise.. Not bad at all.. I have seen better.. but I ve seen worse.. and its not system taxing.It is a survival game. You save via your base house ( like a lot of them do these days )Crafting is easy, minus the part that you have no idea where or how to get a few things you need.. but that makes it better. You are on an alien planet, you have no idea what is what. Of course you can just look it up via the information on forum etc.. But my advice.. Dont. Enjoy the not knowing at first. It is not hard to figure any of it out. Normally in the form of pick something up and then you know.The control setup seemed confusing at first.. as the listed controls are for controler and PC both.. and I could not get them to change. But it didnt really matter because they are all standard setup anyway for KB / MOne thing I have not made up my mind about yet.. you cant sleep time. IE.. I built my house. Trust me.. night is scary right now.. like the Forest when your getting started.. but no way to fast time it. So I spent my first two nights hunkering in fear at the sounds around me, hiding behind my fire.. which thankfully seems to scare off a few critters that came running full tilt at me.. keeping my back to my hut wall.Its not a bad play at all so far. I am even scared that my next day will be my last.. again.BTW. Happy Birthday.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=687727843http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=687727910** I refer to the Forest, which could be considered a competitor to this game, or vice versa simply to get the idea accross.  When I say its like the Forest.. I mean it. If you recall the Forest about midway of it's EA life.. This is that, only the things that want to eat you are different.  It is also a bit slower paced here, yes.. easy to die early if you have no clue.. but the enemies are not so unforgiving.Consider this a bit more low stress. My daughter is scared to death of the cannibals. Aliens she enjoys."

,Recommended,406170,22070861,"Posted: 26 March, 2016",all,wxkeep,"The Island:-- The island really is very well done.  I'm running a 780Ti and have absolutely no problem pulling 60 frames per second.  Its well designed and gives a lot of attention to lighting.  There are numerous locations on the map to explore and discover, each with its own set of challenges, creatures, and resources to tackle.  In fact, if you're going to build out everything in the game, you're going to have to do some exploring.Survival:-- To me, survival isn't vastly different than most games in this genre.  There is hunger and thirst.  Hunt for food (at least five different types discovered so far)  and collect water.  Yes, the game advertises other survival metrics, but they don't seem to play a huge role.  Stamina is really only about how fast you can cut things down or throw a spear.  You're able to sprint indefinitely.  Hot vs Cold (at least in story mode) only seems to apply when walking in fire or in a couple of ""cold"" locations that you can quickly dip into, get what you need and get out.Audio:-- Aside from the voice acting (which could use some work) the audio is really solid.  The island makes so many different noises from regular ambient noise to the various creatures on the island.  In fact, early on, until you've learned the noises each critter makes, the audio can really keep you on the seat of your pants.Weapons:-- So far, I've found six weapons, I believe, which really helps in  survival.  So far, I haven't felt the need to build many traps.Story:-- The story is pretty basic, so far, but it has provided a really nice motivation to the game.  Everytime I think I'm about to escape the island, I find I need to solve one more ""puzzle"".  How do i get in here?  How do I get one of those?  Etc.  Its given me reason to explore the island without making things seem easy.Overall:-- If they keep developing the game it will really shine but, as it is, its a good spend for $15ish.  I think I'm about 10 hours in and can see myself spending a few more (I really want to figure out how to get off the island).  Multiplayer would be a nice touch, but maybe just for survival mode, not the story."

The FPS was shocking and the fact you can't turn down the music as it's tied with the environment was a killer for someone who records for YouTube.  It looks like it could be a potentially good game, but the first hour of play counts and the fact that it freezes windows while loading (it even warns of this) makes this feel like it's still an Alpha....a very early alpha.  We can't recommend this game at the moment, even though most people seem to be having no problems at all due to the positive reviews.

,Not Recommended,406170,24005861,"Posted: 1 July, 2016",all,ThePro-G,"First off, Yes this is a Early Access Review and yes I totally understand that it's in development.  I applied for a refund, didn't get it so i'm writing a review for others instead.What really really drove me to give a negative review is the lack of actual content.  Now yes early development means not much content but believe me, 80% of it is absolutely useless.  This game is literally a game of a guy, who is lost using the same spear, eating same food and drinking the same water, There's no point in building anything other than the tent to save the damn game.First off, weapons.  Your given multiple weapons, Bows, arrows, matchete, club, bombs, spears.  Sounds like alot of weapons right?There's only 1 you will need and ti's the spears and it's the first thing you make with a stick...The bow does not function properly, no draw back, can't aim down either and arrows are extremely expensive to make.Bombs are impossible as the item needed is so far away and your bag space is so limited, spears are better.Everything else is the same, pretty pointless cause the amoutn of attack you need to 1 spear is 3:1.Second, Buildings - Traps/Fences/Towers/Storage/Totems.Now survival games you got, the small simple one, some travel one and it gets bigger and bigger and bigger.... This game doesn't provide that aspect, sure the building IS bigger, but the size difference... it's like... going from a tent to a Dumpster (BIGGeST SIZE) and the material you need from 1 to the other... will take 1-2 days of farming the mats.  Not even worth it.  No extra functions either, purely cosmetics (Barely).Traps are great, except the mats you need to make them require way too many and I mean... WAY too many.  Also SOME traps require very unique mats which is just way too far to get, take a full day to run there and back + food + water + weapons.  Your not really protecting anything as nothing hostile ever enters your base... and even if there was there are totems! (explain later.)Fences... they're way too short and really again provides nothing as nothing ever attacks your base...Towers... yea nothing attacks your base... again... and mats is way too many, takes a full day to farm that stuff for no reason... you might as well run around throwing spears instead, better aim.Storage... There's so many individual item storages... that it's absolutely frustrating.  I mean it's cute but there are items I had in my inventory that I couldn't store.  So.. I had to throw them away.Totems...  Since I said i'll explain later, it's basicly an item to ward off monsters... every monster I killed I got a totem.  So... my base had around 30 totems just around... but nothing attacked me so I don't even know if they worked TBH.  They were my only line of defense lol.  My whole base was open.So thats why 80% of the buildings are useless.  I had a ton of storage... but I never actually took anything off the storage as I didn't need like... 80% of the items I found.  All I ever needed was Stick/Spear, Meat and water (First thing your taught when you enter the game basicly...)Third Combat, Combat is just run back throw spear once spear hits once, stunned throw the rest and they're dead.  They just run at u and attack, no abilties not even different run speeds.To the Devs,I believe that adding content or improving current content to have some value.  Reworking current content is probably the better idea.Adding abilities or benifits to towers... or actually making towers taller (but your AI already has massive issues vs players on different height levels)Walls need to be taller too.  Kinda weird it's so low.  Evolving the walls to have spikes or even holding the heads as totems would be nice as well.  Or adding enemy carapace to the walls too.The Homes could actually be bigger as well, the fancier homes you have aside from the tent is actually really small and would take forever to build them.  I mean I can barely put anything inside those homes.Food could use a huge huge upgrade.  At least add a different value for every item... doesn't make sense an EGG feeds as much as a whole rack of ribs.  Adding different benifits would be nice, like making u feel full for a while.Weapons could get a few upgrades too.  Spear is the ezest and only thign worth having for a weapon.  Arrows are so weak, same distance as spear.  Melee weapon is so hard to obtain and not worth the farm again.I truely believe that 80% of your content actually does nothing and it really really needs a rework to add a significance to the game so that it makes me feel like I NEED or WANT to make it."

By night 3 you are being completely over run.--Previous Review; All points are valid--13 DEC 15I fully recommend this game—conditionally for v0.987. My only other survival game experience is ARK and Forsaken Fortress. Thus, my survival game experience is limited to those games, so please keep that in mind.PROS/Subjective (My Opinion)-Scary as hell--monsters can freak the living crap out of you. I spent one of my nights on top of a rock surrounded by zombies and other aliens. Sniff* Sniff* Shriek*; is all I heard for the entire night…while trying to figure out what I was going to do in the morning.-Great Sound Effects-Good Graphics-Good storyline-Well thought out overall game design/foundation-Structure plotting-Entertaining resource hunting-Fairly easy to get the hang of-Finding Water is not as hard as people think it is, but not being able to drink or even collect beach water and filter it later is wierd to meCON/Objective (Fact)-Still fairly buggy because it isearly access, just something buyers should to consider and be aware of.--I have only experienced three to four blaring bugs that need fixed, sooner rather than later.CON/Subjective (My opinion)-No player customization-No player skills/talents/progression of any sort-No structure customization, just base design (*all structures are pre-designed and only require X amount of resources to build. Player made structure/plotting designs would be awesome and fix this CON for me)-Very limited weapons choices-Limited resource selection/variety-Only one save file-Currently no multiplayer-Alien spawn rate needs to be adjustable on ""new game"" or within an options menu. Possibly an ability to disable it completely for those who want to just “build a base” and get to know the game for a few hours."

While there are many survival games out there today, there are few that are built around single player.My feeling is that this game originally intended to be released as a multiplayer game, however was instead released as a single player game with a weak story line. I'm speculating this, when I consider the almost non-existant story, and the limited set of craftable items that don't make sense in relation to the actual game mechanics themselves.This is a retail game that feels like one that is in Early Access.Honestly not worth it."

,Recommended,406170,18372510,"Posted: 7 October, 2015",all,sHaKeNbAkE,"Alright at first thought this may be just another survival game with lizards but this one totally caught me by suprise.   Here is what I am loving about this game so far:Performance-  Running maxed out and getting about an average of 40 fps (gtx780, 16 gigs ram, i7, etc.).  No crashes or bugs as of this posting.  While good probably will continue to need optimization as it develops.Visuals- Game looks fantastic and very atmospheric (great work on the skybox as well).Sound- This is where the game is a 10/10 already!  The sounds in this game will have you on the seat of your pants especially at night.  Not to much and not too little just enough to get your imagination running wild.Environment-  Plenty of area to explore, great foliage, various animals to hunt, creatures that hunt you (very scary at night),   Resources are available but you do have to venture out and explore.   Hope to see island/landmass increase over time as indicated.Crafting-  Works well but UI could use some fine tuning and current carrying capacity should/could be either increased or allow for additional containers to be crafted.  You can craft a storage container out of bamboo but doesn't seem to currently offer option to store extra items (bug?).Resource (water/food)-  Food seems to be plentiful but the water is currently hard to find and limited.  I do think the water consumption rate needs to be looked at as it depleates too fast in my opinion.  Will be nice to see more animals added that you can hunt (really fun).Story- Yes there is actually a story/plot!  While limited now I hope to see this expanded upon...where are we? Why are we here?  Can we escape back to Earth? etc. etc.Here are two videos from my livestreams that will give you a good sense of how the game is as of this posting:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_clRwKGyXY4https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgG_HCkJ9_Uhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pyMR-G7XVU"

Massive shame.This game came out March 2016 and since then there has been a few small updates and the last was june 2106. The devs have said there are no plans to update this sloppy attempt at making a game, and havent seemed to explain themselves nor let us know officially, nor written so on store page.Most consider it to be abandoned without notice nor apology as far as i'm aware.The other two games that they have on Steam are negatively rated, it would seem like theres only one Developer or small amount of them, trying to spread their time across 3 games that everyones moaning about.Way to go Stormcube games, you've killed your company before it even had chance to take off.Watch out for this company carefully in the future.I will update/ edit review if anything happens."

However I have got to say that this game keeps you on your toes. There is no time to chill out and have a picnic. Provided you have the right strategy you should be able to survive. People say they die too quickly, that is just because their strategy sucks. Keep getting thirsty? Then build your base where you know there is a water fruit node nearby! Keep getting hungry? Pull your finger out and do some hunting! Keep getting killed by dragon? Stop prancing around like julie andrews all over the hills and be a bit more stealthy! Everything else killing you? Stop swinging your machete like it's the only weapon you can get and make yourself some spears which are sooooo easy to make! It takes some getting used to I am not going to lie but how boring it would be if there wasn't a challenge!Something I will say is that while there are a few hours gameplay here and some nice areas to explore it would be so much more fun with a friend, but watch this space because 2 player co-op is planned! Well done devs! Make it happen!There are downsides too but they seem to be far out-weighed by the positives. This game has the potential to make you jump with some heart-pounding sounds and an atmosphere that a lot of people will feel on edge in. Again this is where people get stressed...it's like trying to teach a kid to sit on the toilet. They flip out because they have to stop have everything done for them and do it themselves.All in all not a bad game AT ALL. Performance could be better get around 25-30 fps but there are no lags and although the creatures can look a bit strange and not as attractive as some games the atmosphere combined with these is spot on."

There is even a disclaimer on the loading screen that says that the game may ""appear"" to freeze while loading.  At one point I waited for over 5 minutes for the game to load and when I moved the mouse, it was replaced by the Windows default loading circle so I knew it waas a real crash and not the game being slow.  This was repeated 4 or 5 times with the same result AND after the game was set to the lowest settings.

There are quite a few different things I'd recomend the developers do, such as a reticule or something to help with the spear throwing or bow shooting also maybe a sleep mode for the people who don't like to go out at night (unless they're trying to beat the game). There are also quite a few other issues like the lack of a good in depth tutorial, it seems like you just hit the ground running (maybe thats how it's supposed to be?) Survival aspects are great, building is pretty neat as well (though it'd be better with co-op), and the game really does make you jump in your seat. I'd give a solid 8/10 for this game."

And while it does have some decent visuals, that seems to be about all it has going for it for now.The overall performance of the game on my system was not great. Movement and action were a bit sluggish. I'm not sure if this was due to my computer performance or if that is just how the game is currently functioning. I currently use an AMD 6300 FX 6-core processor, 12 gigs of ram, and an AMD Radeon R7 with 2 gigs of memory. Not a top of the line setup but it has no problem running ""Subnautica"" or ""The Forest"" or any other game, now that I think about it.The build mode and user interface leave something to be desired. To build something, you have to first gather a type of resource. A stick, a piece of bamboo, some leaves. THEN you get to see what you could possibly build from these. This is something that ""The Forest"" does way better. Everything you could build is already there for you to see with a list of what you would need to collect.Build mode in Vortex is all through the ugly inventory screen. You select what you want to build, hit the little hammer icon, place the item and start throwing resources at it. But there isn't much to build just yet.Collecting resources isn't the best. You start with a machete and use it to cut plants. So far, you can cut down a piece of bamboo and get 3 bamboo logs. But when you hack at a tree, you get nothing. Hack at a leafy bush, get a seemingly infinite supply of leaves. Hack at a shrub, get a seemingly infinite supply of sticks. This is another thing that ""The Forest"" has done very well. In that game, you can hack down just about everything and basically clear cut a huge area while collecting resources. In Vortex, it's nothing like that.One major problem I found is that falling from any height, no matter how minor, seems to damage the player. It's very unrealistic and kind of annoying when you are trying to climb down a rock outcropping.The other thing is that food and water are pretty difficult to collect. Water appears to be almost non-existant. So far, the only water I could find came from a water plant. Hunting for food comes down to crafting some throwable spears and chucking them at these pig-like creatures. As far as I can figure, that is it.So to sum it up, this game has potential to be something good. It's just not there yet. I would recommend holding off for a while until it has been further developed."

Combat is okay, but could be better.  Overall, I would say look for it on sale maybe but it isn't THAT bad."

The dragon got me a few times, even from behind a rock. The crafting was easy and fun. I had more traps than the island had fauna! The best catch was the screaming hyena thing. Always screaming. The graphics were good. However I managed to fall into the odd rock or two, whilst climbing cliff walls that would make Spiderman resign from the Avengers! If you want a simple, yet slightly unfinshed but fun game; then this is for you. Don't take it seriously."

I was just utterly bashing on this game. The First Uhm, I dont know 10 minutes of gameplay you can see and find many flaws/ annoying aspects to the game. I actually had a good laugh those 10 minutes that was how terrible this game started off. But I said heck im going to push through as much as I can take, and a hour later I found myself not having a blast but there is alot here, with need of improvement. This is (sorry to Stormcube its just an easy way to compair it) Literally The Forest with aliens and your character has dialog here and there. Every action, movement, even picking up and rotating placement of buildables.Heres my recommendation, if your just passing by and you think this looks intresting and have never played or own The Forest.go buy The Forest.If you own The Forest and have the spare money and like the idea of that setting but Aliens, with a few more kinks and bugs in the game, buy vortex.If you cant stand frame rate drops, playing on lower resolution than your typically used to get smooth frames, games that feel sorta finished but missing something, or just the typical rager I NEED MY SUPER REZ POLISHED AAA GAME NOAW. Than avoid this game."

,Recommended,406170,18363901,"Posted: 6 October, 2015",all,BamaKaPow,"Vortex: The Gateway is yet another Unity Early Access release. It seems that there is a new one released every day. I was skeptical at first but I was drawn in by the game trailer video and screenshots. It looked interesting so I thought I'd give it a shot.One thing that sets this game apart from the other EA Unity releases is the story. The game begins at a party with you having a good ol' time dancing, drinking and socializing. Faintly, you can hear a TV news report in the background spewing some information about a black hole or Einstein-Rosen bridge....wait, what? Then the sky turns purple and it begins to get interesting. Next thing you know, you're on some alien island with stuff thrown about.Game play is similar to other games of this genre where you run around exploring a large land mass or in this case, an alien island, gathering supplies and crafting tools, weapons and other useful items. You start out with a few basic supplies to get you going but they will not last long. You will need to get to work gathering nourishment quickly. There are a few animals running around, screaming loudly, that you can hunt for food. I did not encounter a water source but I really didn't look for one either. The enemy or monsters or aliens are lacking a bit as they don't pose a real threat since you can easily outrun them. I actually jumped on top of something and was fairly safe from one for a while.The graphics are well done and the island does indeed look alien. The animals that I saw were unique, interesting and had decent AI. They ran away from me but also attacked me trying to protect themselves as I was trying to attack them. During my game play I only saw one alien whose entrance to the game was spectacular! However, the excitement that his entrance created was short lived as his AI needs tweaking. He was able to track me but he was slow and caused little damage to me as he was hitting me. I was unable to cause much damage to him as I was having issues with dehydration and low stamina.The game performed well on my mid-range system with the graphics set to ""high"". I didn't notice any lag issues or other performance problems. The sounds and music in the game were very loud and do not yet have a volume control that functions. You save your game progress by pressing the 'V' key.All in all, even for its initial release, the game is pretty stable and very playable. I did not encounter any game breaking bugs or issues. Of course there are minor bugs and other issues that I'm sure the developer will be working on. I enjoyed my game play and am actually looking forward to playing more.I do recommend this game and if you buy it while it's on sale I believe it's worth the price. You may, however, may want to wait a few days to see if the developer releases any patches, just to see how determined he is to continue the game's development.Here's a video of my game play and my initial impressions if you are interested:https://youtu.be/1u6jHEgtyso"

I felt obligated to stand up and warn all those who might buy this game because they think it is an actual finished and polished product. I have no idea why the game came out of early access, I assume it is because the devs are trying to dodge the stigma that is being associated with alot of EA titles. The game has glitches and bugs beyond number. It had potential and perhaps still does but you should know that while it may have technically been ""finished"", it is still a early access title. Don't expect much and you wont be dissapointed. I will not recomend this game at this time because I think that going into a ""closed beta"" period and then miraculously coming out of it with a ""finished"" product a very short time later is a sloppy and underhanded attempt to grab a bit more cash."

For anyone who played and loved ""The Forest"".. this game is a MUST-BUY for YOU!For being in early access and on alpha right now at such an early state of development, this game is AMAZING!  The graphics and sounds are great, the controls work fluidly, and the game can straight up scare the heck out of you at night when you get the wrong creatures chasing you!You start off the game watching yourself at an office birthday party and the news going off about how mysterious worm holes are taking people to some far off place.  Well, for you this is a great thing because it turns out that earth is being invaded by aliens.  The bad thing is now you will be all alone on a mysterious jungle like planet and will need to find a way to stay alive as you find clues and reports of what is happening back at home on the planet earth.Now is where you get to actually control your character from the familiar first person perspective in these sandbox survival games.  You see around you a few broken pieces of your landing pod and a few items including a bag of chips, a instant food package, a box of grape juice, a lighter and most importantly a machete.  You'll need to pick all of these items up and hope for the best because you'll need it on this alien planet.Using the machete will help you acquire recources you'll need to discover all of your craftable goods.  You'll need to find and collect resources to learn how to make items that use those resources in the recipe.  For example, all you need to make a spear is a stick and your machete, but you won't know how to make a spear until you'd cut down and collected a stick.  To make a house, you'll need to find and collect bamboo logs and large leaves and so forth.  To craft an item such as a tent or a house, once you know how to make it, simply click the craft icon even though you will not have all the needed components and place the framework or ""plan"".  It will stay where you have placed it and be glowing blue until you bring all the components to it and placed them onto it, at which point it will be a completed structure.  Use houses or tents either one to save your game progress with the V key when you are near it.At this point, you cannot ""sleep"" and will usually spend the hours at night looking for items and resources needed to survive.  As with the usual survival game, water and food are critical to survive.At night, you'll notice the beautiful fauna that grows in this world as well as a huge earth-like planet that rises over the horizon.  You may also here and see an alien space craft arive in one of the warmholes much like how you got here and this spacecraft will drop a green alien round pod that you may later find as you travel about.  Beware however that aliens will start populating this world and the longer you survive, the more challenging and populated your world could be with this very aggressive alien zombie-like creature!Also threatening you are little ostrich like creatures that will definitely take the opportunity to peck you in your back if you aren't looking (I've had this happen a couple of times) ...and a huge very powerful orange wolf type creature.  Add to this the non stop threats of hunger, thirst, getting lost, and more and you have a very fun and addictive survival game that beckons you to come back long after you log out with its gorgeous graphics and glow-in-the-dark atmosphere.This game may only be in early alpha, but it looks already to be a survival crafting sandbox game that any fan of such games shouldn't dare miss!-  Zaxx"

The basic premise is solid, the opening cut scene is solid, though it looks about as impressive as a 2007 game, and the rest of the graphics would be fine if they ran on my computer.Let's get into the dirty stuff though. The game runs at 5-10 fps on low settings on my alienware, this would be regularly unplayable for me, but I thought I'd try for the sake of a review. Turns out it's barely playable and I was able to make a small bamboo house with a fire. Then night came and my frames dropped under 5 and I died immediately. I understand that this is still an Alpha, but please at least make it playable if you're making people pay 20$ for it, or 14$ in my case, because of the winter sale.The crafting system is interesting. If you've played The Forest, a game I absolutely love, you know exactly what you're in for, down to picking up and moving 3 logs at a time. I actually thought that the same devs that made The Forest were working on this game, until I looked it up. There's nothing wrong with ripping of the crafting system of another game, as long as it works and you make it your own, but when you break it with a clunky interface and restricted recipes based on inventory items, you've just made it worse.Gameplay is almost identical to The Forest from what I can tell. Start at a location with a small selection of vital supplies, gather up what you can, build a base, and hold down the fort until you die. When I say almost identical, I mean go play an hour of the forest and reskin it to look like an alien planet, now make the mutants spawn only at night. Now release that game for 20$ on steam.What it feels like to me is that the devs took The Forest and said, ""I want to make a similar game on an alien planet with a different story but mostly the same vein of gameplay."" Then they took The Forest and made a crude copy of it as a foundation to work off of until they are able to develop it into a more individual and unique experience. At least, that's what I hope happened. It could be that they're just greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s out to make a quick buck, but I like to assume innocence.I would advise any potential buyers to watch this game for a while, maybe a month or two, and look out for how the devs respond to feedback and whether or not they try to improve the game. If you're willing to take a change with that extra Christmas money and get this game, go ahead and give the devs some meaningful feedback, instead of just destructive criticism.I'll try and update along with the game, but as of now, I would not recommend.UPDATE: Wow, the devs on this really managed to pull it out of Day One: Garry's Incident territory. Since this review, they've fixed most of my major complaints about the game. The framerate was fixed and the weird crafting system was improved upon, though it still takes a bit of getting used too. At this point, the only things I could really say about it is that it lacks polish. Movement is a bit weird, swinging with a weapon is a bit weird, throwing spears is a bit weird, but nothing realy breaks the game or detracts significantly from teh experience.The writing is a bit clunky, but in a loveable B-movie way. Mike is a likeable dude, for all the introduction we get to him, and his imediate exit had me chuckling in my seat. The character's lines during gameplay don't add deep characterization, but they're enjoyable enough, especially the line of ""That's a strange being."" whenever you see a new animal. Just adds a bit of charm to the whole thing.It's an enjoyable experience, and somewhat relaxing."
