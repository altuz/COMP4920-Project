76561198240157628,Not Recommended,406220,24351448,"Posted: 16 July, 2016",all,sikker,"Since the only other negative review has no information at all I thought I'd write one. As others have said it is a platformer comparable to Mario 64 and other n64 games. The game has potential but it's still very clunky and buggy, even though it is no longer in early access. Sometimes your character won't respond, sometimes irrelevant messages will pop up for no reason, and earlier my gnome was surfing upside down before he decided to take a swim on the land.Apart from that, the combat is just not very interesting. You can swing your sword and sometimes you'll spin around but other then that not much happens. You can also throw stones but they are very short range, about the length of a gnome.Other people are really excited about the music, for me it was hit and miss. Some good songs, some bad ones. The story seems pretty boring but I guess that's no big deal since people don't play platformers for the story.Things I did like:Some creative ways to make the levels interesting.Difficulty should be good for most people. Not too hard, not too easy.I don't recommend the game but as I said the game has potential. I wouldn't buy the game now but you can always check back in a few months and see if the bugs are fixed.13-12-16 update:Most of the bugs I mentioned earlier have been fixed by now but there are still some other ones, including one where I had to redo a level because I couldn't get a key. There are new attacks and weapons that can make the combat more fun but you don't really need to use them. I was still able to kill everything by spamming regular attacks and even the bosses died rather quickly. For this reason I still can't recommend it.Note that I haven't tried the VR or the multiplayer so this review doesn't apply that."

Even more impressive, it was made (mostly) by just one person.With that said, it's also buggy. Some glitches are fun -- speed runners would love this game -- while others can detract from the experience. And while the artistic style is great, most of the levels (within a world) share the same assets and lack a unique theme. Gnomes vs Fairies doesn't compare to big budget games but, then again, it wouldn't be fair to do so.If you're a fan of the genre and interested in indie games then you'll enjoy Gnomes vs Fairies."
,Recommended,406220,29374142,Posted: 20 January,all,Ire Min Mon,"So, despite my limited time with this game, I should have left this review months ago.The developer of this game is a hero. I was nervous someday, decided to play this game, something wouldn't work, I complained (in a less than diplomatic way) here on Steam and he ended up patching the thing in a matter of hours. He really deserves every cent he gets.The game is fun. With keyboard it works really well, with controller it works better.I play this game on Linux Mint 18 KDE, with nvidia-375 proprietary driver. The GPU is 750M and it works well enough, so don't be afraid to buy this game so you can play on the go. 750M really is not the strongest kind of card.I also use a desktop with open-source RadeonSI driver, R9 285 card and 2560*1080 21:9 monitor. I think I've only launched this game once on that desktop, but as far as I can remember, the game supports ultrawide resolutions natively, even on linux (for those of you interested). I have to re-check this though.The game is, well, relaxing and fun. Look at some gameplay video on YouTube and if you like the gameplay, you will definetely like the game and the developer behind it.EDIT: I have re-checked performance on my desktop. 21:9 resolutions definetely work out of the box, but there seems to be some performance issues with RadeonSI drivers (Mesa 11.2 stack). I will update the drivers and try again. The card R9 285 is, with RAdeonSI drivers in its' current state not capable of running resolutions aka 2560*1080."

It's a fully fledged 3D platformer in the tradition of Mario 64, but it's got lots of RPG elements and hack 'n' slash combat.My experience has been very smooth and I haven't encountered a single obvious bug yet, I can't say for sure because I haven't finished the game, but at this point it seems like all the bugs others mentioned are fixed.The platforming feels solid, combat is simple but it doesn't get boring because there are so many items like grappling hooks and bombs you can use on your enemies. The environments and the Gnomes are cute but there's an overall eerie atmosphere and music. The coolest thing though is every level there are new items to play with, like triple jump boots, shield, fairy wings you can fly with, etc.  I haven't found them yet but the trailer even shows airships!The music creator level is worth the price of the game all by itself, to be honest!  Really fun!!!It's fairly well optimized and runs with no hitches on my desktop and even runs pretty well on my surface pro 3. It also supported my xbox one controller out of the box!!!The bloom and shader effects might be a bit much, but you can turn them off in the menu if you don't like them.I absolutely recommend this game, and at $9.99 it's a total bargain. It's got a big hub world that connects to multiple subworlds, and it seems like there will be a lot of levels.  Some of the reviewers here have more than 20 hours of gameplay so there's a lot of content!Pros:*Nostalgic*Funny*Fast gameplay*Good music*Great level design*Not too hard, not too easy*Many items = many play modes*Developer is all over the community forums answering questions and fixing bugsCons*No multiplayer yet - has it now*No online play yet - has it now*Lighting is a little harsh on some levels - seems fixed"

If you're also like me, you're stuck in a nostalgia timewarp: any game that is reminescent of those from your childhood must automatically be played. I didn't even hear about Gnome vs. Fairies until the 2016 Steam Summer Sale, which, due to it's low price, I immediately purchased on the spot.The story is pretty decent, the gnomes had some sort of four crystals that were destroyed which unleashed fairies into the world and almost every Gnome was taken prisoner except the protagonist. The opening cutscene is paired with some awesome accordian music which soon turned into a rock and roll fest.The soundtrack is pretty good, definitely gives off the atmosphere depending on what region you are in.Combat is pretty fun, although there are some glitches where attacks don't hit properly, or the enemy seems immune. The death animation could use some work, it looks as though your character is just frozen in spot and then you automatically teleport to the beginning of the level.It's fun collecting things such as fairies, berries, and coins. Being able to customize your character with weapons and whatnot is pretty neat.One of my favorite features is the fact there's a hub world where, outside the levels, you can kick back and relax and explore. The shop in the main hub reminds me so much of The Legend of Zelda.All in all ""Gnomes vs. Fairies"" is a very fun, nostalgic expierence, albeit a tad tacky and right now somewhat broken but the developer will probably fix that in due time."

,Recommended,406220,33013583,Posted: 29 June,all,Syrsly,"Gnomes Vs Fairies is a throwback to Zelda and Mario games of the past.This is an old school platformer at its heart with a hack-n-slash style combat system that kind of takes a back seat to the platformer aspect of the game.  The story could be interesting to someone, but the way it's told leaves me uninterested.  However, the dialogue system looks fairly polished, even in VR, and the controls are pretty responsive.Overall, this is a great game if you like games like Spyro and Mario 64, but word of caution, the combat leaves a lot to be desired.  You collect the fairies rather than fight them, which is a little different than what the title suggests.  The combat mechanics are a little too simple at times, not requiring much thought or timing.  Just take out a sword or net and mash the attack button and jump around a little so the enemies can't hit you.  It would be nice if the game's combat got some kind of sword-clashing mechanic and more reason for you to use the shield and fireball.Anyway, for the sale price of $4.49, this game is a steal.  Get it ASAP!  Play it with or without a coop buddy and enjoy either a VR or non-VR camera mode.  It's a great collect-a-thon platformer that brings me back to why I loved the PlayStation/N64 generation.  Good times.VR specific features?Well, it gives you some comfort features, like segmented camera rotations and a seated position reset button, but the GUI does not seem to work properly in VR - not that you need it most of the time - and the camera doesn't follow the player character as quickly as I'd like.  It has some issues with text readability in VR which could be solved with larger or closer text, and the camera goes into walls and objects very frequently.  It is definitely an enjoyable experience, but it has these flaws and the occasional unexplained crash or freeze."

Neat looking game, interesting lay out and very pretty for it's genre. It's simple and rewarding at the beginning, the directions are pretty clear on what to do. Combat is button mashy, which is great. Jumping is a little floaty and unpredictable, especially in precise jumps. The camera I actually like, excluding the random moments where it zooms up my gnomes butt hole. Honestly for $5 (current week only), why not? I had fun and i'll play more."

76561198126520825,Recommended,406220,31966582,Posted: 25 May,all,gretgor42,"For a one man project, this is definitely impressive. Sure, it's a bit flawed and ridden with bugs, but it's still a fun and interesting piece. The game is very enjoyable, engaging and cute, even though it's buggy and unpolished. I had a lot of fun as I left a sense of childlike wonderment guide me through this journey of evil fairies and suffering gnomes. I still have a long journey ahead of me, but I felt like writing this review right away. I may want to change some things as I progress through the game, but I'm pretty sure my positive recommendation will stand.The game's story, as the title would imply, revolves around a war between fairies and gnomes, the latter of which have been imprisoned by the former. As the sole uncaged gnome, you must set out on a quest to save the other gnomes and retrieve their resources from the evil forces of the fairy queen. I quite like the fairies' character designs, they're appropriately cute in just the right way for a treacherous set of female villains: cute, but never nice. I like the intro scene, with the rock band rocking out while telling the player of the adventure he's about to experience. Overall, the story is obviously no Lord of the Rings, but it does its job well in motivating the hero's journey, and it's rather endearing in its silly fantasy manner.One thing I noticed right away is that the camera is, so to say, hyperactive. It seems to move with any little thing that happens, constantly trying to follow the character around. It made me a bit dizzy when I started playing the game. Still, I eventually got used to it and stopped having problems. I do think a more modern and comfortable camera layout would do wonders for this game.The gnomes look like garden gnomes, which is kinda cool in my opinion. The female gnomes could be cuter, they're a bit creepy for some reason. I like that you're given the option to choose your character's gender, I wish more games would do that to help the player identify with the hero. The sceneries look like tiny fairytale landscapes, and the songs are pleasant fairytale-like jams. I really enjoy the setting and the environment of this game, even though it's not too polished nor graphically advanced, as it has a lot of charm and personality.Gameplay-wise, this is a mix between an action RPG and an N64-esque 3D platformer. You jump around, fight enemies, collect tokens and avoid traps just like you would in a 3D platformer, but you also get to obtain items, upgrade your gear and level up like you would in an RPG. I really like this mix, and I'd love to see more games following this formula.In every level, you're given three main tasks: retrieve a crystal shard, capture six evil fairies, and release six imprisoned gnomes. The imprisoned gnomes may sometimes be helpful, for instance, when they hand you a cool piece of gear. The fairies may sometimes put up a fight, and their beams can do more damage than most enemies. Anyways, whenever you save gnomes, a few more free gnomes will show up in the hub world. It is so satisfying to ""populate"" the world like that, but it's a bit of a bummer that not all gnomes will show up in the hub, and some levels will not even get any of its gnomes to show up outside.Anyways, the levels contain the typical stuff you'd expect find in a hybrid between an RPG and a 3D platformer: platforming sections, enemy groups, tiny simple puzzles, and, of course, tokens. The most abundant tokens you find, which are tiny coins with a spiral pattern, are used as currency to buy new gear and items. Then, of course, there are also the tokens you must get in order to clear a level's missions, like keys to release the caged gnomes, and evil fairies you must catch with a bug catching net. The keys and fairies are occasionally cleverly hidden, but never overwhelmingly hard to find. Overall, the levels are fun and well designed, even though they are a bit too easy.The level structures are semi-linear, including a main path and a few branching ones. The smaller branching paths usually lead to extra tokens or objects that you need to use in order to progress through the main path. The levels are in general fun to traverse and well designed, and even though they're mostly linear, they'll occasionally contain small secrets to reward exploration and curiosity.Also, there's a main ""hub world"" that connects all individual levels, and exploring it may sometimes reward you with 1ups, heart upgrades, spiral coins and a handful of very useful items if you know where to look. I also like how you can ride the cute mice by feeding them cheese, and the freaking airship that you can loan from one of the shops.The monster groups are usually not too much of a threat if you know what you're doing. In fact, most monster encounters are a bit on the easy side. In spite of that, I'd be lying if I said it isn't satisfying to slash the crap out of evil fiends with swift, smooth sword swings. Not only that, but mastering the balance between melee and ranged attacks may lead to better, more efficient ways to defeat enemies, which in turn may make a level's traversal faster or less dangerous. I really enjoy this battle system, even though it's so simple.One thing I find really interesting about this game is the element system. You may sometimes encounter crystals that allow you to change elements. That not only changes the element of your attack, but also allows you to interact with different objects and scenery features. For instance, if you're currently with the fire element, you can't jump on blue mushrooms, but you can climb red clouds, and so on. This mechanic lends itself to some nice backtracking sequences that I enjoy a lot.I also like the key-and-keyhole mechanics of the game: you get to explore new things once you obtain a new power. That comes not only in the form of the element system, but also with certain tools you may pick up along the way. For instance, you can open up certain walls by exploding them with bombs, in Zelda fashion.The game has its fair share of bugs, and I think I need to cite them here. Hopefully, the developer will get around to fixing those:- I once triggered the ""interact"" button while on the options menu when my character was close to a gnome, and a dialog box opened up where the first letter of the gnome's dialog showed up, and for some reason that locked me up and impeded me from closing the menu and returning to the game, which forced me to quit and restart.- I saw a cage clip through the floor in more than one occasion in the first ice level, I don't know why.- After I reach the bottom of the slide in that icy hub world, I continue sliding on the non-icy floor, and I have to jump in order to reset back to running mode.- Fairies somehow make you lose two lives whenever they kill you.- This is not a bug, but a tiny incorrect information: the default button for accessing the inventory is TAB, not F, like the in-game options menu said.- You can buy bombs before you can actually use them, as you can only use them after finding a chest that contains them in a level.- In the music island, you may sometimes get stuck in the dialog box when talking to your groupies.Overall, I'd say this game is more than worth its price. It is a tad unpolished and easy, but still very endearing, fun and worthwhile. When you keep in mind that this was made independently by a single developer, the game gets even cooler. Also, when I learned that the developer had kids, I kept imagining how awesome it must be to play a game created by your dad. I wish my dad made games for me when I was a kid, but alas, he hates videogames :(I definitely recommend this game, but only for people whose inner child is still alive. Go play the hero of the gnomes in his journey against fairies in this adorable fairytale setting.Allow me to fire shots here: this lone dad made a game that I enjoyed a lot more than Playtonic's Yooka-Laylee. Let that sink in."

However, what's worse is that YOU CANNOT LOWER IT. There is a meter to lower it, but you cannot move it. You can move the sound volume meters, but not the sensitivty. It makes the game unplayable, as the camera whips around with slight movments, which does not pair well with the thin, corridor-ish level design.Speaking of not paring well with the level design, melee combat. The melee ""combos"" (you mash one button to do them) fling your character around the stage uncontrollably, causing you to tumble off the stage frequently when you are attempting to kill basic enemies. This is just bad game design; the controls and movement should mesh well with the level design, not blantantly clash with it.There's no tutorial level either, teaching you the controls, the combat, and the type of level design. You start out with grapes as your starting weapon (?), which is a projectile weapon. Later in the first stage you gain a sword. This just doesn't make sense; you'd think the melee weapon would be your starting weapon, and you later earn the consumable, projectile weapon.Overall, the base of the game seems poorly designed, as the basic melee combat clashes with the level design, the controls for PC are wonky, and the insane mouse sensitivity cannot be changed.This is very unfortunate, as when I read the description of N64/PS1 hack-n-slash, I got excited, but if the basic controls and design are poor, it makes the entire game fail.Edit: Oh, and there's some jump lag, which for a platformer, is a horrible sin, especially with these levels having small thin islands hanging in the sky. Every implementation and design I saw in the first level just seemed bad.Also, for settings (besides the broken sensitivity button) it shows options for Anti-aliasing, Inverted Mouse Controls, etc., but they don't bring you to a different menu, nor do they have a checkmark/box showing that it's selected or not. Makes it hard to tell if you'e actually changed something or not.HOW COULD I FORGET the camera is horrible. Not just the sensitivity, but it will automatically move around, zoom in, and zoom out without your control. At the BEGINNING OF THE GAME I moved towards the next area, from the starting platform, and the camera rushes until the only thing I can see is my Gnome, then it rotates and zooms way out. I can't figure out why it moves the way it does, but it too, among all these other things, makes this game hard and unfun to play. This is just bad camerawork. Whenever you hear about games having bad cameras, this is it. It impedes the player.Everything about the mechanics impedes the player, which again, for a platformer that needs to shine in the gameplay department, defeats the game in the most basic sense. The simplest fun you can get out of a platformer, good & responsive controls with good level design and level interaction, is not present in this game, so if you want to enjoy a good 3D platformer or hack & slash, this game is not for you.I'd say its a bit of a misdirect to compare this to Mario 64 & OoT, as it is designed much more linearly (more similar to, say, Crash Bandicoot or Super Mario 3D World than the more open levels of 64) with series of connected islands, and is much more hack n slash than the Zelda combat with flashier, momentum-fueled combos. However, if you like hack n slash platformers, this is probably a solid choice, as it mixes up the combat with various items you can combo with.The base melee combat could be improved upon, however, as it merely relies on a single button (though as stated above, you can mix it up with attacks from other weapons).Also, be wary, as spamming the melee combos can be more fatal to you than to the enemies, as they will swing you around, which may swing you off of the island-esque platforms.Personally not my cup of tea, though for others who prefer this genre, I'm sure this would satisfy."

WASD kept the character sliding everywhere, mostly off ledges. The camera spun wildly with the slightest touch. It would be an amazing game if the control responses were taken care of."

Unfortunately, it's in rough shape at the current time. The dev is pretty active about fixing issues that people report, and that's good on him. However, The sheer number of bugs and issues in the game is staggering. I've reported quite a few myself, but every time I open the game I find more and more.Let's talk about the gameplay, as bugs can be fixed. You've got a pretty standard collectathon platformer here. There's lots of different objects to find in the levels, with varying levels of difficulty required to collect them. It's all pretty standard, there's nothing that I've seen that introduces anything new to the genre. Combat feels pretty fluid, you'll be weaving in and out of battle with the various creatures. You'll often times find yourself getting hit without much warning though, which can be frustrating. The platforming is hit or miss. Vertical climbing feels the most challenging, you can clip on the edge of platforms and have to repeat jumps often. Precision jumps to specific points, such as a pole, are difficult at times as well. The level design is alright, there's decent variation in how the levels are arranged. There's a lot of reused assets for every theme (ice, fire, etc) world though.The music for the game is probably my favorite part, he did a very good job with the sound track.Even ignoring the bugs, it's a very generic platformer. You can find better, or wait for Yooka Laylee."

I bought it for sale price of $4.99 and they were doing an update and it stopped working.  Fine steam is giving my money back, but know I have to buy the game for $9.99, which I feel is not right."

Sure it was better then Batman V Superman, but was it the best Vs. matchup to come out this year?  I don't really know...Anyways the gameplay was decent.  It's a floaty 3-d platformer in the style of bajo-kazooie collectathon.  The graphics are passable, and the music is slightly above average but nothing earthshattering.  My biggest problem is it was just too buggy.  This game needs some serious playtesting and revision before I could give it a reccomendation.  If that doens't bother you however, go for it!EDIT* the developer seems to have fixed most of the major problems I had with this game at realease.  I am happy to give it a reccomendation at this time.Full video review for those that like moving pictures and sound.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WEG-7UwGDE"
