Adding in (or at least telling the player where) some ammunition and water locations are would be a great start. A bit of exposition would be nice, at the very least telling us where we are. Explaining the thing I shot at would be nice (some kind of mech?) as well as making the health larger or bullets less damaging. Overall, could be really cool, just not right now."
76561198326309963,Recommended,406280,31205975,Posted: 17 April,all,wellingtonbalbo,"An online survival shooter set in a post apocalyptic world, this is the theme of Desertland 2115, a game that is in Early Access on Steam and that I could test for a few hours today.To begin with, the game drinks a little from the source of games devoted to this theme, and remembers a few games like RAGE, Mad Max and Fallout 3, with destroyed places, debris, human enemies and futuristic machines that can destroy you in a few seconds if you do not take care.The game does well the part of survival and exploration with indicators of ammunition, water and energy, which makes you have that urgency in collecting resources to always maintain high levels. It is totally online so you will find other players between your wanderings on the map, which is pretty big by the way.I thought the game would be more impressive if it had a singleplayer mode, with remarkable characters and a storyline that invites you to play more. After a while playing I lost a sense of purpose, and just wanted to keep my character alive as much as possible.The game is good, yes, you will entertain yourself for a few hours and reward you for exploring, but the absence of a singleplayer mode and small character animation bugs can take you away from the immersion of being present in a dystopic and post apocalyptic world like this."
,Recommended,406280,22759074,"Posted: 2 May, 2016",all,Suicide Trance.,what this game needs is players to make it funit also needs to make the controls easier or tell us what button does what it also needs to give the player a sense of purpose like i need to find shelter i need to get better armour i need to hide like i think away to do this is add more weapons make the mutiplayer so you can work with friends easier and be able to change armour and have a massive bosses roaming the map bosses that you dont want to go fight bosses what make you want to run and hide or try to take down in the smartest easiest way possible but it deffinetly a better looting system and inventoryit has potential

No one is ever on, please if you find this, buy it and expand, it's great. However more items and more item drops would be nice, so you could survive more than 10 minutes by yourself."

I would strongly advise you do NOT buy this game, unless you like the suspense of waiting for your steam credit to be refunded."

76561197961060555,Recommended,406280,24283058,"Posted: 12 July, 2016",all,Ravenskull,"Ok, firstly this game is early access (ie, effectively a public beta) and as such has several bugs that i've noticed so far. That said, the concept is original, the gameworld is huge, and there is a lot of potential. On the basis that the dev(s) continue to update on as regular a basis as they have been doing, i'm minded to reccomend it.Easter egg to spot:If you look carefully explore the ruined vehicles in the spawn town/city, you will notice that one appears to be the APC from Aliens. No facehugger though.Problems noted so far, that you should be aware of:1/ Sniper rifle is a one shot kill weapon against all PC and NPC targets - even if you only hit an extremity (tail or hand).2/Whilst there is a facility for in game chat - by pressing enter - the in game key assignment screen doesn't currently show it. Although it does show an entry for a score screen, that doesn't appear to be functional yet.3/Beware stairs. At various locations they are too steep to walk up, and you have to jump up each step. At other locations (such as some rooms in the underground) even jumping doesn't help. At such locations, you also take damage whilst going down the stairs because they are too steep.4/Sometimes you will be constantly be given the ""press e to pick up"" prompt. If this occurs you will only be able to pick up rifle ammo, meaning you will eventually run out of water and die. On the plus side, you can keep hitting E and get infinite rifle ammo....5/Minimap and gameworld don't exactly match up; the partially collapsed roadway bridges and most of the buildings cannot be seen on the minimap.6/Water appears to be somewhat rare away from the city/town that you spawn in - unless extremely well planned, exploring the map becomes suicide."

But it does have some goods, it is made in unity, and it is not that buggy. But, there is a lot of bads, a lot.5/10 its a meh."
