It's very simple to get a hang of and the devs seem pretty responsive which is always nice!However, the small playerbase can cause issues with game flow and while the available translations are fantastic and show that work has gone into the game, it does segregate an already tiny population.You make your own lobby if you want, selecting the language of the lobby, the time you get to type in and the various themes (up to 5) of your room. You can also set a password here if you want a private game, you blasted hermits.The better themes are usually the broader ones, I made the mistake after playing the game for one match and went and made a room with themes like 'Words for thank you (in any language) because I am completely oblivious to everything logical in the world.When the game starts a random letter will be raffled and you get to input your answers starting with that letter in each of the theme boxes. You only need to enter one in each box and once you've filled all five you can hit 'stop' to force end the round, potentially netting you more points.The screen after this allows you to unvalidate/untick any answers that don't match themes.On the scoreboard you can see how many points you can be awarded for answers at the bottom, if you manage to get the only validated word in a category you get the most, so hitting stop can really help you steal those points ;)Prepare to have a few games where your brain just decides to fall out the back of your head, it's like being a rabbit in headlights sometimes, all while the peppy music loops in the background. Don't listen to the music though, finding a food that begins with X is srs bidniz, we all know this.Occasionally you'll get lobbies with great themes such as 'Names for♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and 'Names for other flappy parts of the body', you usually encounter comedy gold in these lobbies.While the low player count does slow things down a bit, I've been in full lobbies beforehand too and they seriously just melt your brain.There's some issues that have been flagged up in the discussions and the devs are aware, so hopefully the population will grow as the game does :)"

,Recommended,406310,20663859,"Posted: 21 January, 2016",all,Rational Drunk,"Battle of Words is to a vocabulary test, what Quiplash is to Cards Against Humanity. That is, it's a game of solid skill and knowledge, but with concomitant room for creativity and just generally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting your way to victory. Quickthinking, general knowledge, expansive vocabulary, and a good sense of humour are what's required to win this game, and even if you barely fulfil any of the listed criteria, you're still going to have an amazingly fun and often hysterical time.Be warned, however, that the game is low on population. 3-4 player games still make for great fun, however, so don't let that deter you; especially if you have a friend tagging along."

You can't play if there is no one to play with.   You can't do anything.   You should at least be able to play against a computer or something.   The rooms require 10 people and no one is ever playing.

Only thing I might change would be to drop the price a bit, to encourage more purchases and make it more available to get people in there!"
,Not Recommended,406310,33735765,Posted: 22 July,all,Bouma,"This game has a lot of potential but unfortunately its dead. Ive never seen an actual lobby (only played a few times with friends). Just take a look at the steam forums; on average 1 post a month and its some lonely person asking if anyone else still plays this game. They dont get their response until the next month when the next unfortunate is asking the same, only person number 1 has already given up. (Also try finding someone that speaks the same language, haha).I can only reccomend buying this game if you have friends that play or maybe you gift it to them I dont know. Its dead.The whole idea of the game is great and tons of fun! Its just unfortunate that... its dead."
,Not Recommended,406310,23497094,"Posted: 10 June, 2016",all,Beherit,"I applaud the idea, concept, product etc. In theory, this is a very fun game and I'd love to try it out!As many other reviewers have pointed out, the game is unplayable without any players. Every time I logged in to try the game out, there is never more than 5 players online. And as each one seems to speak a different language and not a single one of them being known to anyone else, it's impossible to play this game.I'd estimate the chances of getting your moneys worth for this game, regardless if you paid €5,00 or €0,01 for it, somewhere between zero and non-existant.Great background tune though."
,Not Recommended,406310,22007360,"Posted: 23 March, 2016",all,Chiive,"I love word games and multiplayer competition! I thought 70% off was a steal, but I was wrong. The lobby has been either empty or near empty every time I have logged in.  This means that the whole concept of playing with up to 9 people is a no go, and you usually end up playing 1v1, not to mention nightmarishly long wait times. The game likes to discredit words, even if your opponent(s) agreed they are legit (and even if it could be clearly fact checked, like the name of a country). Achievement progress also states I've played less rounds than I have. Overall, I am extremely disappointed. :("

And let me tell ya, it really is in the rough because there's hardly ever any players. I reccomend if you want to play this game, grab your friends a copy too so you can go in together rather than sitting around for the stray person to show up."

But, for now this game has some big issues, so, if you don't have it already, I'd recommend you wait a little bit more before you get it.The devs have been active in the forums, so chances are those will get fixed sooner or later:- Some bugs that make points not be counted- Some weird things, like considering all votes invalid if you just fail to click ""Validate"" in time, even if you had unchecked a few options- Almost no playerbase, despite the 10k copy giveaway on SG- No explanation for people who don't know the game very well- Lacks a lot of interesting functionalities, like:* Chat in the main lobby* Being able to edit themes and other stuff after creating a room* Having more ways to customize the game, like raising Validation timeIf the devs are reading this, don't get demotivated. I'm sure you can make it better and I'll change my review when I think my overall experience is more on the good side. For now, I have to tell I was a bit disappointed."

There are 10 letters generated/rounds per game, winner is collector of highest points from all 10 games combined.The only 2 negatives are ;1. not enough people playing it, sat for 30 mins and no-one came online !2. I think the price is steep for how simple the game is, if it was cheaper maybe more people would buy it and then we would get some games played !"
