,Recommended,406650,18300613,"Posted: 2 October, 2015",all,Snowskeeper,"Great story and awesome setting.As with all choose-your-own-adventure-style books, characterization is a little lacking. It's hard to make characters interesting when you're not sure how the player will be interacting with them. But while most of the characters are a little tropey (annoying, arrogant rival; upbeat, snarky sidekick; supportive, mysterious boss; etc.), they're still entertaining, and the Dystopian Cyberpunk world is done very well. I'd like to see some sort of internet analogue in a sequel, but that's the result of wanting more, not feeling that the story was missing something.The one real problem I have with this story is one that I have with most Choice of Games products--no asexual option. Yes, you can turn down romance and such (after identifying as straight, gay, or bisexual), but when you do, it feels a lot like you're missing out on content. Wouldn't normally complain about this, as this game is still far ahead of most of the industry, but the dev makes a big deal about being inclusive, so I feel like making noise might be worth doing.So, basic information:Pros:-Cyberpunk-NoireGlory v. goodness morality system (you'll be familiar with it, to an extent, if you've played anything in the Heroes Rise series)-Cool glowing eyes-Gender/sexual inclusivity-Robot bits-Exiled science vikings, maybe?Cons:-No dragons-No magic-No weird internet ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tSo yeah buy it."

There was so much that could have been done with this that wasn't.  It had all the makings of a really interesting epic story and in the end it felt like the writer got bored with it and shipped it incomplete.Also apparently a couple of achievements are bugged.  That's annoying as hell.  The amount of programing it took to make this game and they didn't get one of the few features it has to work?  Come on now."

'Ratings War' is, however, far more comprehensively realised than most examples of it's kind on your bookshelf. Though I wouldn't discourage children from playing the game I would emphasize it's maturer writing style and suggest it's suitability for any age, according to taste.The story itself is engaging, reasonably original and has a good sense of narritive cohesion, though now on my second run-through I'm unsure whether the choices I made had any real impact on the story itself, rather affecting other more superficial (but equally important) features. It's difficult to give a specific example without spoilers, but romantic implications, for instance, may arise that affect your gameplay.I picked it up at £1.34 in a sale but at it's normal £2.00 price 'Ratings War'  more than reasonable for an evening's entertainment. With a playtime of around 3 hours and some deal of replayability it's definitely worth a look. The free demo contains the first chapter, which I think is enough to decide for sure if this is the game for you!To conclude, in case you haven't realised this by now, I would thoroughly recommend this game to any fan of crime fiction."
76561198153108633,Recommended,406650,18400123,"Posted: 9 October, 2015",all,Greyscale,"Ratings War is a story about being a reporter in a near-future setting.  It's competently executed and I've recommended it to several people already.  The cyberpunk theming is nice, but not deep, which I think is actually the fault of the character POV rather than the author.  It isn't sci-fi to the character!  The author does seem to have given thought to the implications of the technologies presented.I can't give an unmixed recommendation, but I'm going to limit myself to one big complaint.  My biggest complaint with the game is with a certain character who is both 'the cavalry' at a critical point, and then talking about throwing the PC under the bus a few pages later.  Come on, that doesn't make sense.  An ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ can save the day without ceasing to be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  ""I don't like you, but I'm not letting THAT happen to you,"" is a thing people can be motivated by.The protagonist herself (her by default; player can choose otherwise) is a peaceful but tenacious individual who is sympathetic in every path I've played so far.  I like that decisions are typically given sympathetic treatment whether they conform to the preferences of people outside of journalism or not.  People aren't villains in their own POV.  (I wonder if accepting that bribe is treated sympathetically, too...)  In general, the game's writing is empathetic, and save for the character I complained about in the second paragraph every character major or minor is given some footing for the decisions they make.  That's pretty awesome.Although it is not without its quirks, I recommend Ratings War as an experience."

You're able to customize your character pretty well and the characters are great, in my opinion, and engaging enough that it keeps you guessing. I had a hunch about one of them, but then I thought I was wrong, with the direction the story was taken. Later, I found out I was right, and it felt like I was in one of those detective shows. It's also well-written, and the universe created for it is pretty solid. All in all, it's a great deal of fun, and it's easily replayable!

Very Shadowrun feel to the story itself, sans the meta-races.  However, I didn't develop the same attachment to my character or the supporting cast that I did in Choice of Robots or Tin Star as examples.  It might have been that as a reporter, my character was more of a story observer than a story maker.   I also felt like some of the plot itself was contrived and more fed to me as a reader than something that developed through choice-based play.  I consider it a decent product for its price."

I got Choice of Robots via a sale and was simply interested in playing a completely text based C&C game. I really liked Choice of Robots, your coices really mattered and you were able to explore totally different stories. I think i played around 7 playthroughs of Choice of Robots, this game sadly appears to be a little different.I managed to stop at a playtime of 115 minutes - yes i am a slow reader - before writing this little review, and at the moment I am contemplating whether or not i want to refund the game, not necessarily because of the money, but more in order to weighten my verdict. Keep in mind that i interrupted my first playthrough and that i am thus not capable of garanteeing anything, the far smaller amount of achievements - compared to Choice of Robots - nevertheless reflects my thoughts.The story seems to be rather out of your hand, while you could make nearly every single decision in Choice of Robots, this game let's the protagonist or other characters take crucial decisions for you, eliminating the possibility of different playthroughs diverging significantly storywise. To elaborate what i mean i'll have to comment on one example for this, which is impossible without a mild spoiler.The scene where i stoped and looked at my playtime:You are making your first real investigation (it did not seem to me that the story could have diverged earlier) and interview someone who called for help, you get out and talk to your ""editor""/helper who wants to meet and talk about the leads you gathered. The protagonist and her helper quickly talk about where to meet and it is decided that you meet at a coffee. You can't decide differently and you still get an achievement for drinking a coffee. This just feels odd. Espacially since the consequences of meeting in the office rather than in a coffee place are talked about, instead of giving you the possibility to think about the different outcomes and make a reflected decision, changing the path the story would take.All in all i am fairly dissapointed at this game atm, and will consider whether or not i will refund it within the next days."

I have played many, if not most, of Choice of Games games, from Choice of Dragon to Wise use of Time.As usual, you get to create your own character through the story and the game introduces in what kind of world you are. I usually play these games while listening ""appropriate"" music list from YouTube(in this chace noir music)My interest was caught by the story quickly. I mean c'mon, mystery + noir + little bit cyberpunk? Nice :)The story was very intersting, so were the characters(yes, even you Early....in the end), there was quite a few funny liners and situations if you made your dialoque choices right and the ending, at least the one I got as truth seeking reporter, was good.7/10, I'd rank this game 6th on my Choice of Games list, although for its defence, this game is on short side of their games.

But compared to other Choice of Games its content is a little lacking. Like most Choice of Games I enjoyed the ride to the end. The investigator spin was pretty cool I also felt like the statistics and choices where lacking or didn't have as huge an impact as the other choice of games. If I were not to compare this to the other Choice of Games, this game has an emotional ride for the truth (my playthrough). But comparing it to the other games I'd go with either the Heroes Rise trilogy or Choice of Robots before I'd pick this game.

Choices are really limited, the branching is obvious and once you made one choice you're quite of forced to stick to all choices similar to that one ""skill choice"" you made at the beginning. The story is very linear and there is very little differences in the writings or in the story based on your choices. Same can be told about the endings : very little variations. Well written, but not really a choice novel, more like a short kinetic linear novel. Enjoyable, but I would not recommend it because there are'nt really anything specific here and it's not free."
