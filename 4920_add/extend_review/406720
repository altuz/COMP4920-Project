,Recommended,406720,32097528,Posted: 31 May,all,Gamer,"Alekhine's Gun is a third-person shooter where you play as a Russian hitman who performs his job swiftly and perfectly (except during the cutscenes xD). Agent Alekhine goes on missions where he must find intel, perform a task, or eliminate a target(s). Also this game is kinda lengthy even though there are only 11 missions on that game. You can choose however way you want to perform the mission (stealthy or go guns-blazing), it is entirely up to you. You also have a rating score system at the end of each mission to show you how you performed your mission (kinda similar to the Hitman video game series rating).All in all this game is pretty cool but I HIGHLY recommend getting this game when it's on sale. $40 for this game is pretty ridiculous to be honest....."

76561198046211790,Recommended,406720,21812753,"Posted: 13 March, 2016",all,Niall,I've played to up Mission 5 so far and I'm thoroughly enjoying this game.I'm a big fan of the Death to Spies games and have been waiting for this game to come out for years.Alekhine's Gun is in general quite enjoyable but it does have its flaws. The DTS games were very hard and I liked it that way. AG is a lot easier than them. Unlike the DTS games there are no guards who are highly suspicious of you. Even the reds on instinct mode are comparable to yellow NPCs in DTS. There are no longer any AI who will raise the alarm on sight on you. If you just walk quickly you can evade the majority of guards.There does seem to be a variety of ways to complete each mission. Mission 4 (Chinatown) was particularly good. I've found each mission takes around 50 mins (not including reloading on save games which happens frequently!)I've had three random CTDs so far and there was graphical glitch with the elevator doors in the Hotel mission but otherwise this game is fine with regards to bugs. The graphics are outdated but that does not particularly bother me. Performance is very good.PROS:-Decent sized levels-Variety of ways to complete missions-Interface and gameplay are much more user friendly than in the DTS games-Good variety of objectives and equipmentCONS:-Too easy-AI aren't suspicious enough-Bad voice acting-Uninteresting storyOverall I'd give this game 7/10. My main gripe is that it is not as challenging as the Death to Spies games.
,Recommended,406720,30387461,Posted: 8 March,all,Rapxtor,"I was looking at reviews and thought, how many of you remenber the time Hitman was released and game reviewers said it was trying to be Splinter Cell (the reference at the time), the fact is Hitman improved and was now his own identity with time and Splinter Cell lost is way, have identity crisis, doesnt know what it wants to be.The same is happening with Aleknine Gun or ""Death to Spies"", the game is improving at each interaction, but there is a long way, and Devs also must take into account to reach Hitman standards to make it a competitor, they have to invest, like IO Interactive made all over this years and paid back by the number of fans Hitman have today (even releasing was episodic against what many fans wanted).There is definatly a improvement over DTS, althrough i find the AI more dumb that the previous games, the maps are large enough to give you many options, and its possible to play boths ways, stealth or blasting, but since the weapons lack power, you wont go far if you choose the latter.The story is weak and you see that it wasnt put much effort in it, and that is a mistake made by many devs of this type of game since most of the time, is the story that immerse the player into the role in stealth games.Alekhine Gun still does many things right, and for fans of stealth games, still is a nice adiction to the library, i hope the devs improve even further if they plan a next interaction, bc there is a market for stealth games if they invest and put effort in the final product."

When I bought this game, I didn't know it was Death to Spies 3 (essentially).  I remember early on thinking, ""Huh, my character looks familiar ... and they sure ripped off Death to Spies a lot ...""  I had to check, and sure enough, this is the pheonix from the ashes of a failed attempt to make Death to Spies 3.If you've tried Death to Spies and you like it, then this game is probably worth buying.  Though, a couple words of advise; save often AND IN DIFFERENT SLOTS because I have had saved games go corrupt.  This game crashes on a fairly regular basis, and while they claim to be working on it, I still randomly get crashes.  And there's no windowed mode, so if that's a deal breaker for you -- well, consider yourself warned.This game is NOT the caliber of Hitman.  It's not gloriously and beautifuly rendered, but it's not ugly.  And I'll be honest, I can't tell you what the story's about -- I tried to follow it, but lost it in the midst of cutscenes.  That doesn't really matter, anyway, it's an excuse to sneak, explore, and find creative ways to end people that someone's assuring us are bad.  I don't remember the stories from Death to Spies, either, for what it's worth.If you're the sort that wants a beautiful, perfect game and can't deal with the occasional crash -- don't bother.But if you're okay with a rough diamond, enjoy this one and save often :)  Seriously, save your game.  Different slots, too.  Really!"

,Not Recommended,406720,21794230,"Posted: 12 March, 2016",all,Roy,"When i saw this game's screenshots i was nearly sold.When i read that this is the followup in the Death to Spies franchise, the deal was sealed.I hastily bought the game so everything i would encounter in the game would be new and surprising, sadly this wasn't a very booming surprise.The game kind of plays like Death to spies and/or hitman, but it sadly feels very bland and simple in comparison.First thegameplayWho doesn't love sneaking around through high profile places to take out high profile targets using disguises and clever tricks? I think most of us can at least appreciate it.When i got into the game i could easily walk into the building i had to be in with incredible ease, i don't even recall using a disguise to do so.When in the building i quickly picked up a soldier uniform from a guy i stabbed. This was the lowest ranking soldier in the complex.Like in hitman and the death to spies titles, there are higher ranking troops/officers who will eventually see through your disguise if you let them eyeball you long enough.However, it won't stop you from casually walking or even running through restricted areas, because the detection is so slow that you can casually waltz your way past anyone that should cause you trouble.This could be countered by ramping up the difficulty, maybe, but the biggest problem is the AI.When i found my high ranking officer (i was playing stoned, mind you) i decided to just walk up behind him and stab him in the back in a hallway. There were 2 other guards there but they weren't currently facing me. I stabbed the officer, took his disguise and was ready to walk away.Only then i noticed at least 1 guard was facing my direction, while the other one had his back to me and the dead guy although he was standing next to us. The other one was at the other end of the hallway, about 15-20meters away from me at best. He simply didn't recognise the stripped corpse on the ground despite facing us.Deciding to test how broken the AI was i proceeded to backstab the guy next to the corpse (still not noticing anything), i dropped him and the other guy on the hallway was still chilling. So i walk up behind him and stab him too.At this point i realise it's awful easy to get away with stuff undetected, so i run through the building and sabotage one thing and assassinate another officer in similar manners.Not once did i get close to getting caught even though i was killing nazi's left and right near their buddies without waiting for an oppurtunity to strike or luring them out first.In other words; you won't be feeling the need to get all strategic and clever, because you can just easily sneak up behind people (even when not completely isolated) and just shank them in the back. The knife animation is very quick as well.Oops, quick edit! I forgot to mention that the knife doesn't have to be used in a backstab manner, you can also stab people from the front or whatever direction you pleaseThen finally thegraphics and soundThe game looks a lot like the old death to spies titles, you can basically expect hitman blood money's graphics but with some kind of odd shadowy/bloomy effects everywhere, it doesn't look bad and graphics definitely don't make the game, but the levels look rather bland and lifeless. Also people hardly fit in with the environment, they're easily spottable beacons because of the shadow effects on their characters and they really stand out.Unlike in death to spies i did not feel like i was potentially always in danger and in an enemy zone.The sound is pretty meh, the voice acting sounds like it's done by a 20-year old something developer who decided he could put on a grainy voice for the narraration, which sounds incredibly forced.TL;DRThe game feels too easy to exploit and instead of disguising and poisoning your way through the levels you can easily run through them and shank everyone with minimal disguise while not getting detected.The graphics and sounds aren't candy to your eyes or ears so unless you want a revamped (but simplified and glitchier) version of death to spies then this might be for you.I refunded the game since i do not consider this game worthy of 35,99 (full price being 39,99), it feels and plays a lot like a ""wanna be AAA indie game"". I am definitely considering a repurchase when issues have been fixed at a later date, but in it's current state the game is rather mediocre for such price.(My suggested price would be around 20/25 bucks at max)."

Hitman Style- You have the ability to change outfits, hide bodies and either take out your targets the good old fashion way of a bullet to the head or using the environment to your advantage.==The 50/50==1. The story sadly never really caught my attention. There isn't much characters to really get interested in and once you start your mission you feel no connection but to just run through it.==The Bad==1. Audio - I found a lot of audio issues such as enemies just spamming words at you, audio cutting in and out or non existing any more such as gun sounds sometimes randomly just cut out.2. Crashes- I found this game would randomly crash, most noticably after beating a level or restarting a level.3. Bugs - I a lot of bugs such as doors not opening, A.I phasing through objects such as walls, floors and doors. And sometimes killing my target has them flying off the map alerting everyone to my position.....4. A.I - The a.i is rather dumb. I found times the enemies would just walk down the same hallway and notice me pointing my gun or shooting their fellow  teammate only to see them decide to look at a dead body and walk off....I also found times after running around the base in the same outfit they caught me in they would not even bat a eye...==Overall==Honestly I wanted this to be good but sadly with all the issues I had, I have to recommend not picking this up unless it's on sale."

Like in the rest of the Death to Spies series, you are a russian agent who has to kill targets, retrieve information, etc.I think the developers improved on every aspect of their series and this game is quite well made, albeit a bit glitchy. But so far I have not encountered a game breaking glitch.If you like the old Hitman titles, this is definitely a game for you. And at half the pricetag of the new Hitman, it is quite a bargain.I compile a small list of differences compared to Hitman Blood Money (imo the so far best Hitman title):- Picking locks is a mini game, in which you need to match ur picks to the locks. This is quite a nice addition, imo, as you can be very fast if you are good, but you can never really calculate how long you will need.- The levels are often more sneaky than in Hitman. Although they massively improved this from the old titles, where it was almost impossible to finish anything without heavy sneaking, there are still quite a few situations where you cannot just simply don the right suit and go through everything.- The setting is in WW2 and later apparently in post-war America. I personally do not like military settings so much for such games, as you feel less inclined to be in and out without being noticed. But there are also plenty of levels in non-military areas (2nd lvl is in a Hotel in Switzerland, e.g.).- It does seem that there are less ways to complete missions as opposed to Hitman, but that might also still improve and ofc I have not played this game long enough to really say that.Overall, I can definitely recommend this game. It is a lot of fun and hopefully gets even better.Update: I just finished the game (playtime approximately 9 hrs) and while I still recommend it, only few levels are really nice. Most of the levels suffer from the same problem I have with the other games in the Death to Spies series: The areas are huge, yet there is not too much to do and most people are armed and looking for you. This means that in the later levels, even in disguise, you cannot pause a lot, because someone will get suspicious. Moreover, many levels are more like mazes than actual free spaces, so there is not much planning involved. The game, unfortunately, is rather linear with very few designed approaches to finish a mission. As I said, I still recommend it for fans of the genre, but don't expect something great."
76561197979438474,Not Recommended,406720,22152237,"Posted: 30 March, 2016",all,Zednaught,"Alekhine's Gun, a successor of the Death to Spies series, is a game in what I'll call the 'social stealth' genre. Players are more likely to be familiar with its most popular games, the Hitman series. Players are a secret agent, tasked with exploring large levels and accomplishing some task, usually an assassination. The appeal of these games is the feeling of being a wolf in sheep's clothing, as one dons disguises to infiltrate diverse areas like mansions, nightclubs, or military compounds. There is a puzzle element in place, as players are encouraged to observe and experiment to find the ways to dispose of their targets in the most silent or theatrical way possible, all while escaping detection.Technically, the game looks dated, but still pleasant enough, and runs quite fast. I had two crashes over about 10 hours of gameplay. Controls are smooth and responsive.In the past Death to Spies games, there was a stronger stealth element, with the ability to creep and crawl through foliage through its often massive levels. Those abilities are gone now, and what remains is much more akin to the usually excellent Hitman games.For the first five levels of this game, I thought the developers had pulled it off. Levels were varied, with many ways to approach my objectives. The only major failing of them was that they lacked atmosphere that makes the hitman games so good: large crowds, snippets of dialogue, and a great reaction to some of your most spectacular hits. Here, though, even when a man is violently electrocuted, there is usually only a subdued reaction. Still, the gameplay was solid.Then, about halfway through, the quality takes a nosedive. The levels all take on a military theme, buildings are designed nonsensically, and my options were much more limited. Many of the environments are completely indoors in an endless procession of similar looking corridors. An aircraft carrier, for example, is depicted as a confusing maze of rusting walls, with no seeming logic to their layout.Suddenly, every little flaw felt glaring-- a lockpicking game that's too slow, enemy patrols that take forever to move, only to give you just a few seconds to unlock a door (never enough time) or complete some other task, and an AI that is at once stupid and at the same time too observant. They think almost nothing of seeing a man sneaking up behind them with a garrote and missing his grab, yet their eyes remain glued on you constantly, making for a frustrating dance as you constantly run in and out of their sight.This would have been a cautious recommendation if you had asked me half way through, but unfortunately I cannot recommend Alekhine's Gun."

One of the most glaring problems that I found when playing the game is simply that the game, besides the objectives, doesn't have anything interesting in the freaking first level, the clear representation on how a game is supposed to be ""played out"" eventually. Gradually adding more and more depht that you experience from the beginning, up until the end.A lot of games seem to do that very well, but I can just now help but wonder in this game what the second mission might improve upon the first one, is it going to add different methods for me to murder mi targets besides the one that's been the same from the first mission?But in reality what made me quit the game and simply request a refund was how horrible the performance of this game is, I can stand a bad game, I really can, I even liked a lot of the ""Army of men"" games, what I can't tolerate its a game that attempts to copy another game (Hitman) and ends up misrepresenting everything that makes those games great, while at the same time having the audacity to work whenever it feels like.I don't recommend this game, not now, not in the future, not ever, not when its on sale, certainly not when its full priced, just strafe away from this game, listen to the reviews, and understand there's nothing that this game offers that you can't probably find in other games, even in the prior ""Death to Spies"" games, haven't even played those, but have heard of them...

While yes, the game has elements of the series and Hitman Blood Money, i couldn't have expected a worse remake.Firstly, stealth is far too simple, sneaking into the castle really couldnt have been simpler due to the god awful AI, i wouldnt have even needed a disguise. I stabbed the target in plain view of several other guards, who overlooked it, like you would a drunk man throwing up on the street, he walked on by and said &quot♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; as he is scripted to say when officers approach them.Secondly, the maps feel somewhat reused. or at least recycled, but this isnt a great issue. I only managed to reach the third map however, due to the game crashing.While this wouldnt normally be an issue, this is how i discovered that the game does NOT HAVE AN AUTO SAVE FEATURE! nor does it have a mission select, meaning my only way forward was to replay the levels. Which also wouldnt have been a problem, but the already recycled maps mean that, to someone who has already seen them before, hold no replayability value.Gunplay is also more tedious than it is fun, youre forever stuck in an aiming stance and felt largely clunky to use, and therefore make gunfights avoidable by convenience rather than survivability.TL;DR: A rather poor remake of the Death to Spies series thats trying to be Hitman: Absolution rather than a good stealth/spy game"

Anyways, don't think this game is worth the money, buy it when it goes on sale. That is, if you can handle the crashes (Seriously, it crashed all the time!)"

,Recommended,406720,29073109,Posted: 6 January,all,5Andysalive,"Hitman (1/2) inspired game.  The low budget shows a bit and some levels are not overly complex but it's still good. Compared to newer Hitmans, there are too few ""accident"" opportunities.  It's usually down to good old handywork.RP Points are given for style, gadgets/weapons can be unlocked and upgraded for those points. Story isn't extremely gripping  but good enough to keep motivated..Shooting and fighting mechanics are ok for such a game. Don't really understand complaints in other reviews. It crashes occasionally(1-2hours) but runs otherwise ok. Cutscenes are on Dishonored2 Level. Which means pretty cheap (or stylish, still not sure) voiced over stills.All in all a decent game. Graphics are also decent. If you're out of Hitman and can forgive a certain clunkiness here and there give it a go (Sale).Native 21:9 support although bits and pieces of the HUD can be obstracted. But no real problem.And it has a proper save system. With manual slots, quicksafe and everything."

People who say it is a ""proper Hitman"" should have their head checked...Thank you Valve for the Steam refund policy.If I was you guys I would avoid it till the price drop to £ 2.99 which will be soon...Did I mentioned crashes?"
