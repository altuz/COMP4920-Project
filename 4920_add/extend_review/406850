,Not Recommended,406850,27799706,"Posted: 27 November, 2016",all,76561198002511762,"I really wanted to like this game, I tried more than once, but in the end I think it has one major flaw that I just can't get over. It doesn't know what it wants to be.It's suppose to be an RTS but it isn't exactly, the game is designed around a beer economy power up system that requires you beat missions the way they want you to. Every. single. ♥♥♥♥ing. mission. has a set of 3 rules that you need to follow in order to earn beer, the games meta currency, which often restricts you to a single frustrating puzzle-like experience, except without the time to think due to how perfectly you need to time your moves. The missions that don't require you to beat them a certain way for beer STILL have 3 rules you need to follow, and even worse than the beer these are linked to your actual progression. If don't win enough of the missions while following the devs asinine rules for those missions you won't even have enough points to unlock the next story missions.So you've got some bad mobile inspired mechanics mixed in there that just drag the rest of the game down too much. The controls also don't feel smooth enough for the kind of things you need to do, often fumbling trying to spit groups and send them on specific paths for the sixth time in a row, just trying to get the timing down right, all sense of strategy being done on the first attempt.So what you end up with is what could have been a fun RTS but comes off as a hectic puzzle game that leaves you feeling more relieved than satisfied at the end of each level."
,Not Recommended,406850,24501545,"Posted: 24 July, 2016",all,Ryan Dorkoski,"Crush Your Enemiesis an RTS in the same vein asAdvanced Wars.The artwork is great, and the dialogue is certainly funny. Overall, my problem with it is the controls and timing being such critical factor for success that it makes it more stressful to play, instead of fun.I played with both mouse and keyboard and XBox360 wireless.I played the demo for ~2 hours, and I was very impressed. For some reason, the full game does not suck me in nearly as much. I honestly don't know why, but feel strongly enough to write a negative review. At this point, I don't think I'd recommend friends run out and buy it. The PC demo was removed so I don't think thats an option at this point, either. You can download a free version on iOS, though.For starters, while I appreciate the controller support, it is not great at all. It feels quite tedious to play with an XBox 360 wireless. In fact, overall the game was clearly built for mobile touchscreen (I have it on my phone, too). Once again, timing issoooimportant here (many of the mission objectives are based on very precise timing to accomplish - we are talking about seconds meaning the difference here, too), and using the controller is awkward when trying to click on units/areas of the map (which is all you do, really).Such a focus on real-time gets quite stressful when combined with awkward controls. Thats all I can really say.Pros:+Great retro art and feel+Dialogue is really well done+I do really like the idea - like I said, the demo totally sold meCons:-The controls are awkward IMHO, particularly when using a controller (the demo did not have controller support, FYI)-To a large extent, this feels (and likely was) built for mobile-Too much focus on very precise timing, to the extent that things get stressfulA shame, really.I really looked forward the full release of this one.Peace,"

The top rated negative reviews almost convinced me not to buy it but it was on sale and I’m glad I did. It was a lot of fun. Not groundbreaking but clever enough to scratch the RTS urge. I played through the whole game in 3 – 4 sittings.The “most helpful” recent negative review fails to mention that you don’t have to get 3 heads (stars) following 3 rules when playing a mission. You can get 1 or 2 of 3 and go back and get the others later. And the number of heads needed to advance is not so difficult. You don’t need 8 out of 9 heads from the first 3 levels to play level 4, for example. Game play progression is well designed, introducing new units, objectives, strategies, and building elements gradually so it never feels stale or monotonous. There will probably be a few levels that are frustrating to get 3 stars, but you usually play the next level and go back to that one later if you are a completionist.The constant clicking and paths the game chooses when moving units can sometimes be weird and detrimental, but it is more annoying than makes the game bad.  A good RTS should have some nail biter moments where you are on the verge of losing but pull out a win in time. And not every level is like that. Some of the levels will feel puzzle-like, but in some of those cases it makes for a fun challenge rather than feeling tiresomely tedious. Also, Advance Wars was a turn based strategy game not real time so that comparison doesn't make sense, other than they both have simple (mostly) elegant designs.Overall, if you are a fan of simple but fun RTS, definitely pick this up. Here’s hoping for a sequel."

,Not Recommended,406850,28398453,"Posted: 15 December, 2016",all,Human Error,"It's clear that a lot of love was put into this game, but as it stands the control scheme is frustrating to say the least. I didn't realize when I bought this that I was getting something that feels like a half-baked PC port of a mobile game. It might work really well on a touch screen, but the entire game consists of telling guys to move here and there, and on the PC the operations for doing so are difficult and finnicky. On top of that, several of the stages have a time limit. It's not fun trying to fight with a frustrating command interface, especially while the clock ticks. Even something small like allowing you to pause the action while you issue commands would make this game much more playable. But in its current state I feel like this game is too much frustration for too little reward. If you're thinking about getting it, for now I recommend you pass. If you really want to play it, maybe get the mobile version.Edit: As a note to the devs, instead of the current system of having to click several times each time you move (and often the clicks don't seem to be counted and units don't seem to move after you've told them to), it would be much smoother when using a mouse if left click moved the entire unit and right click was used to divide the unit into parts. And since there can only be 50 guys in a unit, why not use numbers 1 through 5 on the keyboard rather than having to futz with a little slider every time? For example if I have a tile with 50 guys, I could left click and then click a destination to move everyone. Or, I can right click, hit 1, then left click the destination to move 10 guys there and leave 40 behind. Or 2 to move 20 guys, 3 to move 30 guys, etc. For rare cases where I need to fine tune it and move exactly, say, 14 guys, then I could use the slider (or better yet, the scroll wheel on the mouse), but only after bringing it up via right click. This change would make it much easier to play. Also you really should just get rid of the time limits altogether. They do not compliment this type of game."

Game is getting bored...""Starting 2th campaign ""Wow.. New big strategy feature. It's getting challenging""Crush Your Enemies is polished nasty strategy game with a good game idea with a lot of design mistakes.What i like.1) Simple and undestanding rules for a strategy game2) Funny and brutal animation (especially battles)3) There were some challenging levels where i was forced to think hard to pass it through4) You control only units in the first campaign. Main feature of the second campaign is resources. You must collect wood to recruit new units and gather wood to build building. Thisreally simple feature make the game much more interestingWhat i didn't like1) Story dialogues is trying to be funny. I havent found them funny. I read them for 30 first minutes and skipped the rest of them. There is no voice acting. There are sounds of burble for every character. These sounds are repetitive and annoying.2) The middle of the game is boring. There are only 4 types of units + boss in the first campaign.3) AI is stupid. I havent seen diversity in its actions. There were some levels which is nearly impossible to win against the real player, but they were designed to play with dumb AI, so you can pass them.4) I have found some game features is really strange. For example, why a group of warriors can't attack while an enemy group of archers are shooting?5) The idea with beer is bad. Actually, i have passed first campaign and have got all 72 heads (all objectives) without using any consumable items. But this items could give another players feeling that they can't complete the level without them.6) Multiplayer is dead. You can't get all achievements.I have bought this game for 3.49$ and i had some enjoyable hours of gaming.This game has some design mistakes but i am pretty sure strategy funs will find something interesting for themselves.I recommend to buy this game on a sale!"

Do not buy this game.Good art style. Funny.Controls are good enough; they feel awkward at points. Clicking doesn't seem to always register as it should. Apparently it is a mobile port which would explain that.Unit balance is terrible; as not. At. all. It completely ruined my experience. For an example, ranged units that stun melee until they are at half health and then can move away (coupled with requiring to 'take' enemy terrain before you can chase) means melee units are useless. As a bonus, there are many maps where you only get melee units. <sarcasm> So much fun </sarcasm>"
,Recommended,406850,25663639,"Posted: 23 September, 2016",all,anglerman,"Though the campaign can be finished in about 3 hours or so, this game is ridiculously fun.At first I thought it would turn out rather boring and slow-paced but hell, wasn't I wrong.Crush your Enemies isn't as it says, a 'glory-days-RTS' since it shares so few similarities with the genre as it was in the early 00s, but it does show its creativity as a standalone game.Pros:-Tile-based one-screen seems obvious enough for turn-based strategy but for real time it's something new. You're always watching what the enemies are doing and this plays a huge part in the tactics section. Welcoming change.-The gameplay is frenetical: decisions must be made constantly. How many guys do I need to keep the units income flowing? Since the number of units in a single tile controls the speed of everything they do, separating them to micro-manage is key.-Strategy and tactics are both indeed required; managing shield bearers, archers and mages is rewarding as well as deciding 'build' orders, which go vastly different from map to map.-Graphically it's very solid. Everything feels crunchy and well animated.-Musically decent, fitting with the theme.Cons:-As a mobile port, controls are fully moused and may not come out as intended.-Little troop variety. Units are very specialized but alternatives are missing. I was expecting giants, catapults, cavalry, women, pigs, but none of that is present, only warriors, archers, shield bearers, scouts and mages, apart from map-specific gods.-Campaign is way too short. No alternative such as conquer the world campaigns or anything randomly-based other than skirmishes. Sense of accomplishment is rather halted in this.-Items are weird. They're interesting to use and provide a lot of strategic value, but nearly half of the missions ask you to win without using items. This is counter intuitive as the only campaign resource you collect other than 'stars' is beer, which is used to buy items, which mostly just stay there.-No upgrades whatsoever.Overall 7.5/10, good fun and very enjoyable but kinda lacking. Get it on sale."

,Not Recommended,406850,28237358,"Posted: 7 December, 2016",all,Jtalk,"The mean game with unclear sense. If it's a hardcore gem, then controls are extremely dumb and unprecise: it takes up to 3 seconds to split a group of units, making micro-management almost impossible. In other hand, if it's a simple time-killing adventure, then it's complexity level is roughly unregulated. There are simple levels adjoining hardcore unpassable ones with vast amounts of micro-management included.The game looks like a student's practical, it would look alright as a free-to-play browser time-killer, but paying for it does not seem to be a fair bargain.

However I quit being extremely frustrated.If you don't mind being a completionist, this game could be fun otherwise, dont bother.This game is ok as a mobile game while traveling I guess, but this is one of the few games I got in excited, and got out frustrated and enraged.Good things +++Game play:it's easy and simple! so far so good, it has some interesting rock scissors paper way of using the right units in the right places in the right way.artstyle:the art looks ok I guess...Bad things ---Story:It lacks the voice acting that you hear in the video's. all you hear is some mumbling. because of this, the story feels tedious and boring.3 skull achievement system:Each map will give you 3 missions you need to accomplish, accomplish 1, and you'll win the map. However, if you wish to get 3 skulls on EVERY map, you can forget it. 90% of these missions are very possible. which makes it even more frustrating when you get to the ""capture all buildings"" missions. These are impossible. because to do this, you need to keep the enemy alive long enough for you to take over the buildings. if you kill all enemies within a building, you lose. It's hard to explain, but I got 71/72 skulls in the first campaign. being forced to give up on that last skull crushed me. I don't believe I will even try any of the other campaigns because of this.Horrible AI:they try to suicide themselves into the nearest enemy... Which is extremely frustrating when you're trying to keep them alive. Which is hilarious since the game is supposed to give an emphasis on ""crushing your enemies"". But the main goal is to keep your enemies alive long enough to achieve all your goals.Beer:to buy ""items"" for each mission you need to capture towns. these towns generate beer. which you can trade for items. However. every single time you beat a mission you need to manually click the beer on every town. since each town gives 3 beer, make that 3 clicks. this part reminded me of a frustrating clicker game. having to scroll back to your first levels just to collect some crappy beer...Items:the items dont fit in the game... at all... they feel like they're just added in to make the game slightly easier. in the first campaign you get 3 different items... you dont need a single one of them... ever... and in the games where they WOULD be usefull. one of the missions tells you not to use items. so yeah, items dont work in this game."

With elements of those games where you have to link points to pump spawned minions to another point, and elements of Fire Emblem style rock-paper-scissors.The only negative that I can see is that it feels like it's made for a mobile platform. If this game had hotkeys I'd be like 200x better at it."

This game took BOID and improved apon it and made another simple yet FUN type of games or ""simple to learn, but hard to master"". If you have the money for it and like RTS games... I suggest you pick it up (the only thing I don't like so far is the cost of the game... I think it shoud be atleast $4 but if they add more to the  multiplayer like 2v2, 3v3, FFA, etc and a Level editor this game would be worth the $10 it is)"

Challenges are generic and kinda boring *Crush your enemies in X time* *Crush your enemies with X survivors* however, the artstyle is very nice and the game is funny at times. Not recommended."

I forgot about this game for a short period,  but I still think I should give what I consider a fair review on it. Maybe it's because I'm not a graphics person, but I still think  it's not worth 9:99, however that is just me, some people may have a different opinion depending on the style you play."

I couldn't find spirit of those in modern productions, so Crush Your Enemies is the game I was waiting for.It takes the best design ideas of games from 90s like unit balance, economy etc and adds alot of innovative features.All levels/maps are small, placed on one, non-scrollable screen, but this gives player full controll over situation.Unit controls are different then most games like that, but it gives more precise/convenient control of units, and makes gameplay more dependent on timing/strategy skills then on precise mouse pointing."
76561198048385355,Recommended,406850,32021750,Posted: 28 May,all,TerezarOmega,"The game at first appears like a simple click and drag ""strategy game"", but the second you get into it you realize how much depth there really is. The games can quickly become a really tense fight, as you desperatly try to hold territory while ensuring your unnits are banging enough to keep you troop numbers up.Deciding which units to convert to upgrade classes and how many, where to position them, which territory to take, all in the space of a battle that can end is as little as 10 minutes, means that there are a lot of decisions to make and fast. If you are the kind of tactician that prefers chess or other turn based games, this one may not be for you, but any fan of classic rts games like starcraft or warcraft should get this game."
