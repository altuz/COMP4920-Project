It’s definitely one of the best titles of the genre I’ve played so far. I loved the fact that it rarely got boring, and the puzzles were good to solve.10/10. I liked it so much that at least to me, it’s worth every cent."

The visuals can be adjusted in the option menu.Game AudioI want to mentioned that the audio for this game is well done even if it's simplistic and somewhat repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the option menu as well.GameplayThere are only three difficulty game modes to choose from: Casual,  Advanced and Expert.Diary Notebook it keeps track off all game's objectives.The inventory panel has the option of locking in place to make it stationary.The interactive map allows the player to fast travel between each location quickly. It also indicates there are tasks that needs to be done at certain locations. But it isn't immediately given at the start of the game. A unique feature of the map is that it can be flipped front and back.Most of the hidden object scenes consists of find ""x"" amount, fragment items and traditional word lists with little or no interaction. The hidden object scenes with traditional word lists doesn't show up until the very late in the game. Some of the hidden object scenes can be replayed in the game's extra content section.Most of the game's puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of them. Some of the puzzles can be replayed in the game's extra content section.Two collectibles: 'Etheral Flowers' and 'Beastiary Cards'. Each has thirty collectibles to find throughout the game.There are twenty-five different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the game. Each of these achievements do has some requirement before they can be unlocked. The achievements are tied to 'Game Story,' 'Hidden Object Scenes,' 'Puzzle/Mini-Games,' 'Collectibles.'There's a bonus chapter, but it can be access, only after the main portion of the game is fully completed. The bonus chapter is pre-sequel to the main story.MiscellaneousThere are total of five different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator.Final thoughts, I've found this game enjoyable to certain extend. The replay value for this game is low. I would recommend this game but not at the full price.http://store.steampowered.com/app/406870"

Unfortunately for you, this same creature kidnaps your grandmother and the friendly man that helped you betrayed you. Your only chance is to reach his castle in this park where slavic fables are honored....Eventide: Slavic Fable is a nice story with elements from slavic fables: everyone around, apart for your Baba, is in reality part of the slavic folklore. Given the fact that you can collect cards about each creature in this culture, you can also learn about it.The gameplay is quite common, though the hidden objects scenes are diversified: from rebuilding an object thanks to a list of pictures to a list of items to find, as they're hiding parts of a puzzle. The puzzles are also well-balanced and kinda easy when you're used to them. Even if the game isn't developed by Artifex Mundi, the gameplay is quite similar to their own games.The ambiance is a surreal one and a nice one, even if the game is set during the night, in a dark forest but it's not the creepy type. The only thing that is weird is the grandmother's head: I don't know how to describe it but I think it's not as well done as the others.The soundtrack is also correct and fitting to the story.The bonus chapter seems to be out of the blue, however, you understand quickly that it's set in the past and that you'll meet again some characters. The bonus are also nice: minigames, soundtrack, etc...Anyway, Eventide: Slavic Fable is a nice way to learn about slavic bestiary and belief. It's also a good game published by Artifex Mundi and almost as the same quality of their own games. As usual, don't hesitate!"

Mini games and point-and-click errands start very simple but towards the end it all seems very contrived and forced. The story is cute, the characters are cute, the painting style reminds me of Avatar, and all in all, I'm happy."
,Recommended,406870,22269704,"Posted: 6 April, 2016",all,pendantry,"Eventide: Slavic Fable is a charming point-and-click adventure that's a pleasant change from the current crop of twitchy games. It may tax your memory and observation skills at times, but the unobtrusive hint system is only ever a click away. No tutorial needed: I jumped straight in at 'advanced'. Along the way you get occasional pats on the back to reassure you you're on the right track.If forced to point out flaws, I'd say that the developers could do with a thorough spell-check of the content; there are several phrases and words used that aren't quite right (in some puzzles the odd choice of words adds further depth). Apart from that, the program seems bug-free(except perhaps near the castle drawbridge, where the crossbow seemed to misfire -- I was forced to back out via the main menu to get around that).Well worth the entry fee."

Even like me not very good at puzzle game, the main story can be played without using any hints. (the Casual difficulty) There are total 23 mini games, they will obviously take some time to solve but it is a big fun to play with. Also, the main purpose is clear and story runs smooth. I love those 30 cards which introduce 30 kinds of the mysterious creatures. Especially the sub chara is very adorable, good to see such character appears in game.The additional story is a nice epsiode for player to enjoy the fern flower story in another character's view.

It's possibly not as engrossing, as it's missing the ""investigation chart"" from Enigmatis 2, but it nonetheless sports the same production quality. The activation zones in the puzzle involving several wooden figures are ""way off"" (tried 3 times without success before Hint told me that it was indeed possible), but the rest is excellent - graphics, audio, pacing, characters, object interaction. Eventide and Enigmatis 2 easily set a new standard for Artifex Mundi quality, and i hope they make more titles like these, rather than more like their Time-traveler series.If every HOPA were as well-made as this one, the world would be a happier place. i simply can't say enough good things about Eventide."

Worht paying full price, but always better if you can pick it up in the sale.Basically what you'd expect from Artifex Mundi, some other developers/publishers need to be taking notes.It has everything you need;MapFast traveltrading cardsAcheivementsWorking hint buttonA good walkthrough available on line (though you really shouldn't need it).If I have one minor grumble, it's that some of the puzzles were a little too easy.Rating                      90/100Replay value           2/10 (only to pick up a missed acheivement)Play time approx     4-5 hours"

Fairy and magic atmosphere and characters, well rendered by a vast majority of beautiful graphics.Puzzles (mini games) and HO scenes intertwine well along a good enough story. Mini games are fairly easy. The game in itself is quite easy too, but enjoyable. The pace of the game is ok for casual gamers.Achievements are not difficult to get. Sadly, the game is a bit short. For that reason I'd only get it on sale.A nice game, that Artifex fans could appreciate."
