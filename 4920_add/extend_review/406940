,Not Recommended,406940,22324833,"Posted: 9 April, 2016",all,ChaosUnown,"EDIT: I've gotten through just about everything now and have eventually decided to stop playing altogether. I have nothing more positive to say about the game and my opinions remain unchanged.Let me say first off, the music is awesome, the graphics are great, this game clearly has a lot of time put into it to make it look good. From what they were trying to execute I can understand what they're doing. But that is immediately where the praise stops because this game is a non-enjoyable amount of infuriating.- The gameplay: Dub Dash is an edgy and trippy rhythm game where you avoid obstacles to the beat of the music, or so it seems. The first thing you will notice is that the controls get very strict, especially in more dense sections of levels, because if you slip up once and start going off beat then there's absolutely no way to recover until the obstacles slow down. Additionally, as someone who has played a multitude of rhythm games, Dub Dash has fairly mediocre syncing to the beat of the music they use. In almost every single level I've played I've had to hit my buttons ever so slightly earlier than oncoming measures in order for my racer to remain on beat. I'm also really not cool with how some of the sections play out. There's a flying section that I feel is completely absent of any rhythm mechanics and turns into a mediocre space flyer game with very slippery controls. There's also the maze segment, which is a lot less enjoyable than it appears to be because instead of using the directional keys to move in that direction you're just limited to the left and right controls (like all of the other segments), which makes things really awkward when you're going in the opposite direction, and of course I shouldn't even have to go into detail on what might as well be called the ""Flappy Bird"" segment, which features gameplay I can only describe as ""exquisite."" If this is supposed to be marketed as a rhythm game then all of the non-rhythm segments (the flying and flappy bird segments, for example) need to be scrapped from here permanently. There are so many different play styles here it all just feels exceptionally inconsistent and choppy. If you're going to make a rhythm game you need to keep it a rhythm game. Of course you can mix things up as long as it retains a consistent theme all throughout, but this is not the way to do it. The way I see it this is just a poor combination of different ideas that didn't have a leg to stand on on their own, and it shows extremely well in the presentation.- Practice Mode: If you're having trouble beating a certain level then you can enable practice mode, where you can crash as many times as you want and still restart from the last checkpoint. That sounds really helpful, right? Unfortunately there's one huge problem with it. The actual game music doesn't play when you practice. So if, for example, you wanted to practice the song Milky Ways then it's not going to play that song and instead play the generic menu music throughout the level, and because the songs have differing BPM values that throws the entire level off sync. For a game that's all about rhythm and staying on beat this is 100% counter-intuitive and often makes the practice mode harder than the actual level.- The life system: If you crash you can resume right at the last checkpoint you reached, which again sounds really helpful doesn't it? Unfortunately there's a limited amount of times you can do this, as denoted by the amounts of hearts you have. What happens if you run out of hearts? You have to start all the way from the beginning of the song, sort of like running out of lives in Super Mario and having to start from the beginning, which doesn't sound so bad until you realize your hearts don't refill if you run out and have to start over, and if you're playing a level for the first time without any prior knowledge of what the rest of the map looks like then you'll be expending these hearts exceptionally fast. The only way to refill your hearts is to complete monotonous challenges outside of the main game mode. These ""challenges"" involve completing a repetitive map that is just as long as the normal levels, and you have to beat these challenges without crashing once, which proves to be just one big chore when it comes to doing something as simple as getting extra lives. You may also notice that as you unlock more main levels the challenge stages get more needlessly difficult, adding more tedium to, once again, something as simple as getting more lives. I should also mention that the life limit caps at 15, thus preventing you from farming up to a much more acceptable amount. In all honesty I think the game as a whole would be so much better if the whole lives concept was scrapped altogether and just allowed you to always respawn at the last checkpoint. Repetition does NOT count towards challenging gameplay. It would be a lot more fun if it worked more like Rhythm Heaven, where you can make as many mistakes as you want and play all the way up to the end of the song, and then you get a rating based on how well you performed.Overall from what I've played Dub Dash has proven to be very disappointing to me, which I in turn also find to be disappointing because the game has so much going for it. Unfortunately the way it controls and plays has left me quite bitter. It is not a good game, it's all flashy with nothing of substance to show, and it has utterly failed as a rhythm game."

Instead of buying this, just buy Geometry Dash, its cheaper and provides more to do than this version of google's dinosaur runner.

You basically play the same songs but with different obstacles. Basically relearning that ♥♥♥♥ing song you just learned to do.-NO WORKSHOP TOOLS (♥♥♥♥ing really?)They start you off with some Lives incase you screw up and since each time you screw up just once it costs you a life and you get to start almost from where you died, unless you have no lives then you just restart from the beginning.So as i was learning the timing of the first song i used up all my Lives, and this is where the game stopped being fun.I finished that first song and eventually beat the second. With no Lives at all, just constant restarting and hearing the same loops over and ♥♥♥♥ing over.Then i got to the 3rd song and its fun and all but super frustrating and once you\'ve made your 100th attempt, you kinda just stop caring.I put off from doing this review because i normally don\'t review games but this game made me salty as ♥♥♥♥.If you have money and don\'t rage then maybe this game will be fun for you but damnit this game just needs a few small tweaks  to be fun.Implement:-WORKSHOP TOOLS-Don\'t force people to unlock songs when the ♥♥♥♥ing songs themselves are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I wanna ♥♥♥♥ing play what i paid for, not be locked outif one of those is implemented i will change my Review to a positive but only then."

The camera is warped in a strange way that forces the eye to focus purely on the action, and it makes me feel in a trance. The levels feel perfectly in tune with the rocking soundtrack, and its just plain fun! To top it off, the developers are bros. I came to the store page looking for music DLC to buy, and I was kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥when it wasn't there. That was until I looked in my install directory and realized the devs left the music files there unencrypted, so I was able to put it on my phone and mp3 player! Thanks devs for an awesome game, I hope to master it someday. -PR0XIDIAN"

,Not Recommended,406940,24095143,"Posted: 4 July, 2016",all,Gragon73,"There are lots of great parts about this game. The graphics are entrancing and look great, and there are a heck of a lot of gamemodes.However, I still can't like this game. Some of the notes are placed so they're seemingly impossible to get (or at least ridiculously hard) in a couple of the early levels. In addition, a lot of the levels have irritating or boring gameplay, notably Sound Ward, where there are a couple segments which are the same thing for a really long time. I stopped at Milky Ways; the gameplay mode introduced there is really irritating: you often die before you actually touch the walls.Additionally, there aren't ANY customization features AT ALL. No level editor, no changing the player or whatever you want to call it, no nothing. It's just the nine levels that are currently in the game, and nothing more.I bought this for half price in the summer sale and it wasn't even worth that.I'm not going to recommend this unless Incodra fixes the problems with it and adds a lot more interest."

I'm sold.In more In depth terms: After playing this game. I decided to slightly modify stages, by changing songs played in them. Apart from that, the controls are good if you use something like an xbox 360 controller (I use it and it plays smoother than a mouse and keyboard). I would recommend this game if you are a fan of Geometry Dash and want to see something similar but different.Apparently the developers have not forgotten about this diamond in the rough, and will hopefully be updating it with more exciting mechanics and unique level design. Special thanks to headup games for making a good game."

The beautiful 3D graphics and the rad soundtrack are enough to convince me to buy it. It offers just as much, if not more challenge than Geometry Dash did. The one thing I don't like is the small amount of levels, which I'm sure will soon be remedied by updates later. The thing that is the lowest point of this game is you can't progress to the next level until you've beaten the previous one, and as of right now there is no level creater, and I don't know if there ever will be one. Overall though, great game."

Sure the game looks pretty, but thats where the nicities end. First off, there are checkpoints in main gameplay. Make it a challenge, just make checkpoints in practice mode... Second, this game has a lives system. A lives system! You get 5 lives and then you have to beat a challenge to get more. This isn't a Facebook game, don't give me limited attempts to do something. Third, the transition between rolling and flying is garbage, you don't get to see what's coming in the next stage and it ends up killing you. Don't let my limited playtime fool you, it doesn't take long to figure out that this game is pretty much just straight trash. Getting a refund and uninstalling."

,Recommended,406940,21328824,"Posted: 19 February, 2016",all,Kinix,"=- I don't normally write reviews with such little hours, but this game deserves it. -=Dub Dash. It looks like a Geometry Dash clone, and you're half right. Dub Dash takes Geometry Dash's core mechanics and spices them up to make essentially a 3D and more colorful version. It has the normal jumps, but it makes them more interesting where instead of a jump you weave around spikes. it has the ship, that feels way more tight than it should be, yet feels perfect for the game. Dub Dash also adds it's own vehicles to the genre also, such as the maze, where it almost feels exactly like a maze, then there's a 3D infinite runner style vehicles, that plays like your stereotypical Agent Dash. Every vehicle changes your perspective too. With the jump one, it looks like you are orbiting a planet, where as the ship looks like your normal 2D platformer ( in it's own 3D way ).Gameplay feels perfect. Controls are simply left and right arrow key, allowing for the 3D aspect of the game to actually work. The game seems like you could get about 10 hours in, which is good for 5 dollars!Graphics are fun to look at, but can hurt your eyes especially if you have epilepsy.Overall: 8/10 can't wait to see updates!"
