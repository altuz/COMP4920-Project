,Not Recommended,407020,18675997,"Posted: 25 October, 2015",all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"Let me start off by saying first that Star Sky has a nice concept, but the content is not here. The attempt is there, it's a unique concept, but a far too expensive one with far too little content available.My first impression from reading the description of the game was that there would be multiple roads to walk down, and it's ultimately left up to the player which roads to take. This is not the case. What you do is hold the right arrow key, continuously walk right, and stop whenever you hear music playing so that you can trigger events.There are multiple ways to trigger events, and there are a total of 18 events to trigger; each one with their own achievement. However, in a mere 22 minutes I unlocked 14 of the 18 events. This game isn't very long at all, in 50 minutes I unlocked all of the events, and at an asking price of nearly $5.00 CAD it's just not worth it.I could defend the value of the game if the graphics were more than 'stylish' silhouettes with backgrounds that would've taken a couple hours tops to make in Photoshop. The fact that Star Sky has the same look and feel to it that any browser based Flash game does really doesn't help to push this game at its selling price, either.Rating:2.0/5.0- It's not awful, but it's not great.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"

A few nice screenshots you can take, and some achievements.There's not much story to the game, it's just a walking sim, to get the achievements you have to listen to the sounds and then stop moving. It's a simple game.There's no reason to not recommend it, because it's not like it's a bad game for a small price. Though I still suggest buying the game on the sale.Overall the visual were pretty simple but nice. It's one of those games that you can play when you're really bored."

Kind of like Tai Chi. This is more of an experience than a game, as you walk through a lovely evening landscape, going through different experiences. Some of them are quite magical. The whole game is all about relaxing and not rushing. While it only takes an hour to accomplish everything there is, I know I'm going to be revisiting this one quite a bit for its aesthetics and its meditative qualities."

It’s made for repeat playthroughs but it’s actually possible to see everything the game has to offer in less than an hour, which is pretty poor especially when considering the lack of replay value. Once you’ve seen all the events and completed the game, there really is no reason to play again either. As a short, exploratory (and possibly experimental) experience, Star Sky works well. Its £3.60 price point makes it an enticing purchase and for anyone wanting to relax for some hours, it’s a decent choice."

There are a handful of different endings and a few different events that can happen within one nights play-through or many.Graphics:The one thing this game has to offer, if nothing else, is how pretty it is. It's so simplistically gorgeous and really sets a bar for how it should feel; atmospheric, magical and mysterious.Soundtrack:There isn't really much of one either. It's just the 'magical sound' that plays when you are close to a trigger event spot and honestly, it's trying a tad too hard to be whimsical and deep when it lacks a lot of content to be such.Final Conclusion:It's a tad bit pretentious with its 'I'm Adele kind of deep' take on itself, because in reality, it would need a lot of work and a lot added to it to in fact.. Be deep. It's pretty, and has good ideas, but doesn't execute them in such a way that feels meaningful - It just leaves you in awe of a pretty thing for a minute or so.Trigger spots aren't distinct enough for them to stick within your memory - This is annoying simply because you can't step backwards, this means that even if you misstep once just outside of the trigger-zone, you have the replay the entire walk to find that spot/sequence of events to trigger and ending or scene. This would be fine to do if the environment changed substantially, or the events changed and it was just all random, but it isn't. It's the same thing over and over again that you have to reply to ~see all there is to offer~I understand the idea of what the game is trying to achieve in the ""You can only move forwards"" insinuation, as well as the making you patiently wait for your desired result, but even with those stretches it doesn't justify not being able to correct errors you may make a long the way. While you cannot erase them, you can fix them - the inability to walk backwards completely role-blocks that.At the end of the day you really take what you want from it.It is a pretty looking game, it won't cost you much to experience it, and despite all I have complained about, I'd still suggest you go play it for yourself."

However, it seems fo me that some developers are going too far in their attempt to create ""artistic"" games and are actually creating products that are entirely devoid of any significant experiencie to the player. Star Sky fits unfortunately in this category. It can barelly be called a game at all since the only playable aspect of the game is to move the character forward (he doesn't go other way), while standind still at some points of the screen which enables certain effects (as rain, for instance), and the different combinations of what you do produce differente effects that, in the end, unlocks achievements, but have very little inner significance to the player. Star Sky relies almost entirely on the interest of the player to unlock achievements since the ""rewards"" to the player's actions in the game are irrelevant. The interface the game presents could be potentially used to tell an interesting and engaging story, but Star Sky is not."
