76561198138437975,Recommended,407230,23151300,"Posted: 22 May, 2016",all,MirandaKym,"I've played many many RPGs in my day. Starting with Wizardry games on the PC when I was young and onto Final Fantasy, playing the newer ones as they came out. I was a PlayStation girl so I played the Personas, Xenogears, Grandias, Shadow Hearts - okay, listing them all would take too long and is off the topic. But I want you to know how well-versed I am in this genre. :)Legend of Mysteria is the first RPG I've played on Steam that was obviously made using one of the generic RPGmakers and isn't a ""big hit"" game. I thought I'd give something different a chance. And I'm extremely glad I did.Now, it's listed as a turn-based RPG but it's really all about an involving story where you do some serious detective work. In all the hours I played, I fought only a little over 10 battles - half of those, bosses. There is no leveling in this game whatsoever. You have to find different equipment to bolster your stats. And you play as a mage so the trick is figuring out what your enemy is weak against and then finding a staff or accessories that allow you to cast the elemental spell that will annihilate your target the quickest.The meat of the game is interviewing everyone you can. Everyone thinks you're a murderer so you have to find the real culprit and clear your name. Of course, being that people view you as a killer, you must disguise yourself. You begin in a tower full of all different types of mages. You'll need to switch robes often to fit in with whatever group you're spying on. You also get different dialog choices here and there so think carefully before answering. Searching everywhere and everything is a must since you need those different colored robes, and reading notes and diaries on all the mages will help you find clues and point you towards those who might be willing to help you in your cause.I would say this game is difficult. The times I had to turn to a walkthrough, I would sit there reading it thinking ""who in the world would know this is what you're supposed to do?"" But the story was so interesting that I had to see it to its end. What you do during the entire game affects what will happen at the very end. It's just very neat.So in conclusion, this is not your typical RPG. It's frustrating at times and... no leveling? I'm  a girl who loves to level for hours so I can swat the last boss like a bug. In this game, I actually had to strategize my fights and manage my healing potions with care. :p  However, I loved Legend of Mysteria. I was never bored, the characters were interesting and detailed, and I really approved of the music selections they chose from the RPGmaker. The fact that I'm even writing this review at all says a lot because I don't really want to be doing this. I want to be playing! I just wanted you to know how much fun I had with this unique adventure. :)"

,Recommended,407230,32416417,Posted: 14 June,all,Krebony,"Spoiler-Free Review: The game was cute and entertaining. The only thing that I didn't like about it was the lack of direction and the story. I ended up looking up a guide to get through the game because it wasn't always clear what I was supposed to do. The combat was decent, the hidden puzzles/clues here and there were clever. I would recommend this game for anyone that wants a quick game to play or an easy game to get 100% achievements for.SPOILERS FROM HERE ON:The story was way too bloated. It felt like 4 people all had different ideas on what the game's story should be and all tried to write it in. The conflict made sense (head honcho murdered, then having to collect clues in a town of magic-fearing people) but the romance (if you could call it that) felt very last minute and rushed. The clues were fine but I felt like there were too many of them, too many specific ways you had to use them and specific people you had to give certain items to. On top of that, you have to translate some spells. This would have been fine if the translation would stick. Everytime you want to use a certain few spells, you have to re-translate it.As I said above, this game is entertaining at best. If you ignore certain parts of the story and information-overload, this game is actually pretty enjoyable. It's clear that the developer had a good idea here, but it got too crowded with other elements that were seemingly forced in (the whole entire religion speech, the over-explaining how things in the wizarding world work, the too-long diaries or notes, etc).If the story had been left at ""Head honcho Wizard is killed and you're being framed. Now you have to go into hiding and collect clues to prove your innocence and find the real culprit!"", then this game would have been a lot better. Even keeping in the romance would have been acceptable if the story had just focused around ONE idea, not 5.TL;DR - They tried to put a Skyrim-sized story into a game I only spent 5 hours on because I kept getting lost and ended up looking up a guide to get through. (A speed run on YouTube only took a little over an hour, if I'm remembering correctly.)"

Yet, I saw the game was on sale for 51 cents, and I thought, ""Why not?""I must say I am glad I spent the $.51 on this game. I haven't had much fun playing rpg games in a long time until I tried this and the Labyronia series. The soundtrack of the game is probably one of my favorites out of most games I've played. The battles with enemies could be a bit challenging, but nonetheless the gameplay did not fail to make up for it. It was definitely difficult playing the game since it required so much I had to use use walkthroughs like guides or videos to help me out for the rest of the game. I still couldn't complain though, I enjoyed the many puzzles and clues throughout the game.There's a lot of questions I have IF this happened before Labyronia since Windir and Triste marry each other and have a child, and in Labyronia, you find out Arres is their son. Yet the release dates of the games throw me off so I'm not sure if that speculation would be valid enough to say that Legend of Mysteria happened before Labyronia. Either way, much props to the developers of this game.The only thing I would suggest is to fix the brightness of the game. Besides that, great game, and I'd suggest this to anyone who are willing to play rpg games and enjoy long stories."

I bought this in a JRPG bundle and this was the best game in it.It is surpringly hard - the little puzzles and mysteries took me a while to figure out (and sometimes it was so hard I had to have a sneaky look at one of the online guides...). But it was really nice to spend a few hours figuring out all the twist and turns. The story is really interesting and the characters are memorable.I wasn't sure how I felt about the main character but the more time I spent with him the more I realised what an interesting character he was (and how adorably awkward he was with Triste!).My only gripe with this game is that there aren't many battles and no level-up system or anything. It would have been nice to have that - but the story and mystery DEFINTELY makes up for it.Highly recommend this game - really impressed with it :)

Finished Legend of Mysteria and would've more than paid double just for the one game. The graphics are very Final Fantasy Tactics, there are about five, maybe, actual battles that are turn based and easily won. This game is much more about figuring out the palace/tower/race intrigue than duking it out. For the entire game you HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION! Read everything, notice the symbols, things that look like decoration probably aren't, if you have looked in every single goblet and turned up empty, the one you don't check will be the one you need. The puzzles give you everything you need - if you can't figure it out with what you've got, go back and see what you missed picking up."

,Recommended,407230,31181223,Posted: 16 April,all,JMPunk,"One of the most incredible stories I've ever seen.For a guy who is new to the Labyronia Saga, I had fun with it. This game is not much like a fighting type game (you have only more than 3 to 5 fights required throughout the game, others you can take just for fun), but instead it is a kind of puzzle, you need to do some Actions to proceed in the game.It seems this story is the legend of ""the hero of Labyronia,"" so for many peoplel those individuals are well known, some people will say that the story is not worth it, others will love it, as for me I really loved everyone secrets and twists. It's a short game, but if it was big would ruined the whole point of the game and the price is very good.The story is complex, but easy to explain. You are Windir, an air mage in a tower full of other mages of different types and the head mage was murdered in front of everyone when he talked about changing things and you were framed for it. You have figured out how to escape and disguise to pass unknown by the other mages while you try to solve the murder to clear your name. From that, things happen, you realize that the old man was right, many things WILL change, and you collect evidence and more to find the guilty and prove your self as innocent.The gameplay is as good as a RPGMaker might be, at some points you need to be very precise with the items you need to have, the timming and (which really bothered me a lot) the specific locations to use these items. This actually buggy me a few times, for example a candle where you can interact with more than one side (right, up, down, left) you can light it (with the specified item) from just one side; Another example was a switch on a statue between statues ... if your game is a bit buggy (as mine was in some spots) or you get to feel up a little tired, you can lose a lot easily, and this is a pain."

The game isn't all that fast paced, but it has small animal fights like pokemon, (seen in the trailer on steam store) of which I do feel is a bit cheap of them to do, but that is their game...ConsI was unable to get the feel of the game, even after playing like 16 hours of it. I found it hard to follow the story due to the lack of information on the steam store page, and really just all over the internet. I seemed to run really fast when going sideways as well, I noticed the fact that you can go faster going left or right on your keyboard than going forward or backwards (evening this out would make a heavy difference.

While some of the obstacles can be irritating and it's not always easy to find the right piece of information and where to use it, I thoroughly enjoyed this game and would definitely recommend it, especially considering how cheap it is."

This one, while far from the worst, suffers from poor writing - and I'm not just referring to the occasional grammatical error or bizarre utterances like ""I could try and lure my fingers under the door"".  The plot is overly contrived (e.g., when the summary says you are framed for a murder, what it means is that the victim is killed openly in a room full of witnesses and then the murderer claims that you hired him with his dying breath, and everyone just says ""Well, this guy seems trustworthy""), and the world-building comes in the form of a series of infodumps that somehow manage to be brief and rambling at the same time, failing to explain anything very clearly and sometimes giving apparently contradictory info.  I don't think I'll bother giving the rest of the series a chance."

76561198365236399,Recommended,407230,30745032,Posted: 26 March,all,Awai,"Played Labyronia I and II and having played this, I enjoyed the story plot that ties in all three games together.This game differs drastically from the other two games in that you aren't exactly geared towards fighting monsters to level up. Rather, you are mostly on a hunt-seek to solve a mystery. Much like modern click and search games, this is like that, but in JRPG format, where you move everywhere, click everywhere, and try different actions with different characters. This may not be for everyone considering the amount of patience and memorization you have to have to perform certains actions. IE: immense backtracking to get an item back you didn't realize you needed or remembering which note/diary to pull up in front of a character. What was nice is that any monsters you killed previously does not respawn. With  the amount of backtracking at the later parts of the game, I appreciated this fact so I didn't have to re-kill all the monsters as I went back and forth.About the gameplay, it is somewhat linear in that you can progress in slightly different paths, but they all converge down to the same ending when you reach the end of that part. IE: you can complete one side quest before the other. Fight scenes are pretty rudimentary RPG mechanics. Not the best, but not the worse either. Some of the puzzles can stump you for awhile. I enjoyed solving them and even had to use a guide to figure out a few.One downside to the game is the vast amount of items you have. As noted earlier, you need to have a good memory or you will repeatedly scroll through your items trying to figure out which item goes to whom. I played the game without pausing too much inbetween so I had a decent rememberance of each item, but if you play the first few hours and then come back after a week or longer, you may struggle trying to remember everything. For a mystery RPG, there is a LOT of things to be found and to use. A few might even say too many, but considering the story plot, it does kind of make sense as to why there are so many items.Overall, it's a nice game to play. I did end up using the guide for the last 1/4 of the game, but I was progressing pretty quickly in the game in that I don't think I'd reach 10 hours of gameplay. 7.5/"

But i have to downvote it. Why?- I just didn't enjoy playing this game. It has been a frustrating eight-hour experience! This game is like a hallway or NPC simulator. You have to go back and forth the same halls, the same NPCs the same rooms the same everything just to try out if they will react to whatever item you have found.- The game also introduces a bunch of names, like you literally have to note them down only to find out in the end that Ooops! This game is actually a prequel or sequel or whatever of another game. Why didn't anyone from the dev team indicate that on the description?- The flirtation between Windir and Triste is just terribly awkward! It felt unnecessary and unnatural. That kiss scene was cringeworthy.- And the card drop. WTH man. I know it's randomly generated but i received 3 Dinyon cards in a row. Seriously? I'm just so disappointed and frustrated with this game. I cant even"

Several of the puzzles are a rather hard to figure out with straight up moon logic happening a couple of times.All in all though it is worth playing at least once.Give it a go."

What I thought I would get was a grindfest with a decent plot. What I got was a fun detective style game with a decent plot. Worth it's first playthrough, but almost no replay value. One thing to note, there are aspects of the game that are not obvious at all. Pay attention to your surroundings, and be prepared to read a lot of books in game."

It's not your everyday JRPG with many hours of grinding and leveling up, since there is no such thing as a leveling up system in this game. You need to search high and low in order to find clues that help you prove your innocence regarding a murder case.The story, the soundtracts selected, the characters' personalities are all amazing, BUT it is required of you to find all the clues in order to prove your innocence which is quite time consuming(considering that one less interaction with an object can lead to you getting the bad ending)and without the help of a guide really frustrating at times.Despite that, I would like to recommend this game to everyone and anyone, who is willing to learn about a new colorful world with detailed characters and plot that will keep you invested in the story of Windir~P.S. Fangirled so hard at the Windir+Triste moments!"

,Recommended,407230,30806268,Posted: 28 March,all,nujumkey,"An excellent example of how creativity can build an amazing game out of an engine renown for bad RPGs like RPG maker. Combat is almost nonexistant, and frankly what little combat there is i found greatly dragged down the pace of the game.This is a murder mystery. Prepare to spend hours combing through every drawer, trashcan, and NPC you can find trying to find clues and puzzle pieces to keep the story going. At the beginning you are a prisoner charged with the crime of killing the king. To prove your innocence you set out a fugitive running around the castle trying to piece together information about the other possible killers and figuring out what happenned. The world is really built up and if you're willing to take the time and read all the books there is some really good stories in here. You get a really good idea through reading about the warring factions and groups, possible murder suspects and some of the waves the political struggle goes through. The grammer can have issues but untimately i got really into the story and the world, and i think it helps a lot that for 90% of the game there are no combat scenarios. Most of the game is through puzzle solving that makes use of the books and information you have similar to how a point and click game works. It's not what i normally expect seeing the RPGmaker tag.Admittedly some of the solutions are extremely contrived. At one point I needed an item from a cloaked wizard, who said he would help me if i found out what happenned to a girl named Indra. Turns out INdra hangs out in a cell in the prison, but when you talk to her she doesn't actually say her name. You just go back to the hooded guy and your character says he met with Indra in the jaul cell, but she never said her name and i can't tell where else we would have that information. Little things like that pop up everynow and again and it makes a walkthrough extremely neccessary to play the game (taking a bit of the fun out of it IMO). Also towards the end the game starts to really drag on as you encounter a barn and a labrynth with monster encounters. It's not a dealbreaker but it did annoy me that the appeal of the game - murder mystery puzzle solving - had been replaced by the most basic rpgmaker mechanics i had played so many times before.All in all though it's still a very cool game that makes really good use of the rpgmaker toolkit to do something unique and pretty fun."
,Recommended,407230,25578421,"Posted: 18 September, 2016",all,Prite,"I've bought this game in a bundle and to be honest, I found it pretty entertaining, it's not a masterpiece (come on, it's a 1€ game XD )Altough the game is advertised as an RPG, it's not a full on RPG game, it has RPG elements, but it's a mystery/puzzle game. And I'm ok with that.But I'll have to admit, I followed a Steam walkthough I found out, otherwise I'ld had lost a lot of time and/or probably had given up in the meanwhile. The game is a bit confusing and the way it throws so many characters and forces you to memorize a lot of details/information about them is hard. It's really my only criticism of the game, it's confusing, otherwise (again) for an 1€ game, it would be a 10/10."

(I have also finished Labyronia 1.)An interesting storyline that gives a bit of background information for the following game.I personally enjoyed it quite a lot although there isn't any 'leveling up' per se, but nevertheless a game that you can spend a number of hours on if you are looking to start and finish a game within the same night.(My hours are low but I've played for many more, just offline and off the net)"

This game has some tricky puzzles in it, but the only reason they are Tricky is because there aren't many clues as to who to show this note to or what key goes to what door. Overall though, I think it's got a good story so far. I've noticed a few spelling/grammatical errors here and there, but there are very few. If you are interested in Murder Mystery games or JRPG games in general, I strongly recommend you give this game a try. You won't be disappointed."

Puzzles can be very difficult to solve(mostly, you just had to try different things rathen than thinking and it is a bit annoying. Still there are good puzzles.)--Spoilers--I am really annoyed by the fact that Dinyos would just leave us in the dungeon to rot unless I would be able to clear my name myself. I think it is the biggest flaw of the game, it ruins the story line."
,Recommended,407230,33798850,Posted: 25 July,all,YPRPG,"Legend of Mysteria is a prequel to Labyronia RPG, but the style of gameplay is very different. There are only a handful of battles (some of them quite difficult), and the game centers mostly around exploring, finding necessary items, and using them appropriately in the right locations to progress your way through the game. It's fun for the first hour or so (of a 6 hour game), but there are many things you have to discover, and they aren't always obvious. The remaining five hours are spent consulting the walkthrough at every turn.The premise of the story is that, after a leading wizard apparently is murdered, and you are implicated and imprisoned, you must disguise yourself and gather evidence to find the real culprit among 12 suspects. There is such a large cast of characters that it is difficult to keep track of the different stories of who's who and who did what, and unfortunately, this is crucial to figuring out which of the dozens of notes and diaries to use in front of which characters, which again, requires consultation with the walkthrough.Aside from a painful reliance on walkthroughs, there are few things to complain about. The game is rich in content, and the story, while too broad at first, wraps up nicely towards the end, and the ending itself is very satisfying. Overall, it's a fun game."

Repetive gameplay,easy fights, annoying puzzles, and alot of backtracking. The story is good but lacks the motivation to keep playing sometimes because if you dont understand it. It become a jumbled mess that makes no sense.Other then that for a RPG maker game its design is rather unique compared to most JRPG of this nature. Concluding i will still recommend this game if you buy it in its bundle or find it on sale it will keep you interested for a couple of days if u want to get everything with out following a guide."

Adventure with party.I got mystery / puzzle game instead....I know mystery make RPG become interesting. But it's like 95% mystery and 5% (easy) battle.It's like you should go there before here.... And go here before there.... And here and there....Seriously it's more like a detective game instead of ""action"" game like the tag said....For the ""mystery"", the deep of the plot is good enough. There's some ""change"" in the story depends on what you choose to say to NPC. There's something that you can and can't do depends on what you did. The equipment here is more usefull for the story than for the stats. Like you should use armor A for passing this door or accesory B for turn on something.But it's still not good for a ""detective"" game.> There's no ""sort"" feature on item inventory.... And you have TON of items that's still in your inventory even after you ""used"" it for the story....> There's no ""name"" shown for each place when you go to different place. Which is really needed for a ""detective"" game.> There's no map either. So you don't really know what to called place A or place B.> There's no ""name"" shown for each NPCs that was talking. Which is also really important for a ""detective"" game. I know it has a ""suspect list book"" but it's different. The story made you have to go to meet someone, and you forgot which one is it. Well, despite of this case, usually RPG have a ""name"" shown when the NPC talks....> Some NPCs have the SAME face with other NPCs, and some have the SAME face with YOU, the MC. It's a little bit confusing. I mean.... IT HAS NO NAME ALREADY. AND THE FACE IS ALSO SAME?> Too many letters that has to be shown to NPCs. This concept make me bored after awhile."
