I will give any game that does this a thumbs up, but I will not recommend this game. It's a solid platformer, but it's just bland and boring. Someone who's fresh to the genre will not appreciate this game, because it has nothing to offer to them. Just for nostalgia sake, older more experienced gamers will pick up this game, most likely play it to the end in one sitting (~2 hours) since it's easy, predictable and short, and then forget about it.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=604744492http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=658626981Unlocked all achievements!"

You like the love story between the caveman and his dead wife, and you like the challenge. But there's a good way and a bad way to do challenge, and this game does it badly.Floaty controls, unfair level design, bad hitboxes, and punishing difficulty don't make a game fun. They make it ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I'm not going to cut this game any slack because it's an indie title. This is where the big boys play, and you need to do better than this.The game is not properly optimized, and that is the failing of the developers. Gamepad support is only partial, and doesn't even work properly on all systems. The entire purpose of x-input is to make gamepad support idiot-proof, and yet somehow, this game manages to screw it up.People constantly praise how much better games were in the 8- and 16-bit days when they offered actual challenge, but a lot of designers and players don't understand that there was a lot more going on in those games than you realize or remember. It's not just a matter of making a game hard and sending you back to the beginning if you're not perfect. It's a matter of designing levels in a way that makes playing through them enjoyable, even if you're not MLGproswag360noscope. And TWaC doesn't manage to do it right. Take a closer look at games like Spelunky, Binding of Isaac, VVVVVV, Super Meat Boy, and don't dare try tell me that this game is in the same league as them. These games are the end result of spending YEARS making sure that the controls and jumping physics are spot on PERFECT. These games have earned the right to offer players a challenge. Caveman has not.Fix the controls. Make There Was a Caveman 2 and do it right. I'll happily play it. There's a lot of nice ideas here. Skulls as currency. Diminishing returns as you keep dying. Fine. But the execution is straight up bad."

The graphics are solid, and it contains a few clever ideas, but it's mostly just frustrating, and mostly because of its stiff and unforgiving controls. It contains a super bad usability problem where if you pause the game, pressing the jump button exits to the menu without prompting (losing any progress within the level). I lost my progress to flawed muscle memory a few times because of this. You can collect skulls to buy items, but the items are fairly useless because unless you have already played through the game and memorized every trap, you're certain to die before you get to benefit from the item. (This mostly goes for the secret hearts, as well.) On the plus side, the boss fights were all pretty interesting and fun. The music sounds randomly generated, and the sound effects click like there's some 30HZ sine wave starting in the middle of its duty cycle. I played through it to the end, but can't really recommend.Games to play instead: Super Meat Boy, Super Time Force Ultra"

76561198044873014,Not Recommended,407290,18391792,"Posted: 8 October, 2015",all,VietyV,"It has a bit of a charm to it and it does do some things right but there is also a fair amount that needs improvement. I'd recommend this to you if you are prepared to deal with a bit of frustration.The game does a good job of trying to mix things up, it does all the platformy gimmicks like a level where you have to stay on a moving platform and dodge things coming from underneath, or a boss that gets a stronger attack when you've almost killed him (I'm at the final area right now and only one boss seems to have done that), and overall has a lot of elements that could make it a great game, including a level that is essentially a side-scrolling shmup like that old alien shooting game on nokia phones.Unfortunately a lot of little issues come together to make the experience less than ideal.First off, the way that jumping handles in this game is a bit jenky. The first jump works fine but the second jump throws your character in whatever direction he is facing which can sometimes cause your character to get tossed into spikes or other things when you are doing jumps in certain areas that require you to double jump and probably get hit by said spikes.Another issue is hitboxes. Your character's hitbox is a bit weird, sometimes you will get hurt by things that are clearly not touching you and when you jump you have to get much higher than it looks in order to get onto platforms. There have been platforms where the character very clearly is able to jump higher than the platform yet is unable to land on it because the hitbox is a bit off so you are required to take a different path there.  This problem is at it worst during one of the earlier levels where you have to swing across vines in certain areas. You are only allowed to catch onto the vine if you hit it right at the tip which is weird in and of itself but when added with your character's slightly off hitbox it can mean a lot of dropping into an instant death when, visually, your character should have been perfectly fine,A lot of the difficulty in this game actually stems from little issues like this and not actual hard platforming. In the aforementioned section, where you do the whole moving platform across a river of acid or toxic water or whatever, you basically have to stand on the platform and dodge the balls coming from underneath. The big issue with this is that there is neither an animation prior to the balls launching up at you or a consistent timing for the balls. One or the other would have been fine but without both it means your character is at the mercy of the random intervals since you can't actually use timing or visual cues. You can help this to some degree by standing all the way at the back of the short platform and running past the ball the instant it launches then running back (provided you aren't in a bit with 2 balls launching which can seriously screw you over if one decides it's going to resurface in half the time it generally takes). But this strategy gets compromised by flying enemies going at your head that you will have to attack, this wouldn't be an issue at all but when your character attacks he mysteriously stops where he is on the screen while the plaform keeps going so you may end up falling into the acid which is an instant death because your character does something illogical only on that bit.The game attempts to make boss fights easier by letting you find golden hearts that increase your max hp (you start with 3). The issue with this is if you die you will lose the extra hearts. With the combination of most deaths being instant and there being next to no regular hearts for you to pickup (enemies don't drop them and on some levels they seem rarer than golden hearts) the odds of you making it to the boss with the extra hearts is very unlikely. Now let's say you do make it to the boss with the extra hearts, it's gonna come at you and with how easily your character dies you will likely have to fight it a couple times in order to get the patterns down. That is standard with these games but it also makes the extra hearts you might have had when you first encounter the boss virtually worthless and is furthered by certain points which are clearly designed to kill you the first time you enter them because of the surprise which makes anything you picked up (or even purchased immediately before that screen) pointless.Artstyle is pretty basic, wouldn't say it's good or bad. The music ranges from certain tracks being very good to one that is  actually quite annoying given some time.  The main issue pretty much all the music tracks have however is that they weren't designed to loop. There is a very obvious start to the tracks and since it loops right back to the beginning when a track ends it creates very abrupt transitions which does break the mood quite a bit.There are probably about half a dozen other issues that I won't get into yet but yeah, this game has potential but it definitely feels clunky as hell."

There are problems with almost every aspect of how the game flows, from your maneuverability, player and enemy hitboxes and the patterns within levels. A good game provides a challenge you can overcome and learn from, but if a game is challenging because of poor design, you end up suffering for something out of your control. Beyond that it is a standard sidescrolling platformer with a distinctive motif and deficient plot, but I don't see myself returning to play."
76561198059908583,Recommended,407290,19321507,"Posted: 27 November, 2015",all,GameBooAdvanced,"I give this a recommended because I can tell that the developer really cares about the product, and it seems like a tremendous amount of work and love was put into this game. However, there are quite a few blatant problems that hold the game back in some areas. I'll be going in depth on them, but honestly, if you like quirky action platformers, pick it up when it's on sale.First off, while I'm sure this is rectified with controller support, there are too many buttons to play the game smoothly with a keyboard. I hardly ever used the ""dash"" move, simply because it felt to unintuitive with the keyboard. I don't have a controller to play with, and it seems like this was designed with controller support in mind, so take this one with a grain of salt.The music ranges from forgettable to annoying, and it seems like that mainly has to do with the ""retro"" style of it. If it used synthetic instruments instead, I feel like it would be more bearable at parts. But as it stands, certain areas made me mute the game due to the soundtrack giving me a headache. Another minor nitpick, but it seems to loop at weird areas that make it super noticable.There are no lives in the game. When you die, you lose one of the extra hearts you may have earned and start back at the beginning of the current screen you're on. While this seems fine at first, there are some parts where the screen goes on for way too long, coupled with one hit kill spikes, which gets old fast. Speaking of the spikes, they appear often in levels, but only some of them actually kill you in one hit, and they don't look any different from the others. I feel if they each had a respective color, it would definitely be better in terms of design.There are quite a few areas where you swing on vines in the game. While it seems like a fun idea, the vine swings automatically, and you can only jump off of it at the apex of the swing. I've also encountered a glitch several times where  the game auto locks me onto a vine for a split second, and then puts me back to where I was when I was jumping, but having lost all the momentum from the jump, leading to a frustrating death.In addition, the screen scrolls in a way where you are typically vulnerable to obstacles before you can react to them. There are also places where you are expected you make jumps into areas that you can't fully see, with the OHK spikes on the ground. I feel like a lot of deaths in this game are due to no part by the player. While I tend to be a patient gamer, I feel like this would make quite a few players not pick this game up.Most basic enemies are simple and easy to work around, which is a shame because if this game was more focused on complex enemy design instead of platforming, I feel like a lot of the problems would be solved. The action parts are truly where this game shines. The bosses, while challenging, are still very fun and interesting. Being able to throw a spear and stick it to a wall to use as a platform is done geniously. The shoot-um-up segment was great.  If this game ever gets a sequel, I hope it takes a more ""Metroidvania"" style approach. I feel like the combat system and control feel would be greatly suited to a more action-adventure exploration focused environment, instead of a platformed with some action sprinkled in.Basically, here's what I feel could be improved on1.) Fix the vines. For comparison, if it was more akin to the rope swinging in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, it would feel smoother.2.) On longer screens, a checkpoint would be nice. Even if it's out of the way, and a challenge to get to itself.3.) Make it obvious which spikes kill you in one hit and which ones just harm you. A simple palette  swap for one is all it needs.4.) The screen should scroll faster5.) The player should be able to hold down to recenter the camera and see what it below. Instead of hitting down to jump off certain platforms, change it to down and jump.Also, I just want to give the game major props for the atmosphere. It's very subtle, but it works sooooooo well.Like I said before, this is clearly a well made game, but if I was a teacher, I would put a ""Needs Improvement"" on the top of this assignment in big red ink. For what it is, $7 seems like a tad too much. I haven't beaten it, but I think that if you can get it on sale for less than five, that's probably about what I'd say to spend on it. Keep in mind that this is all meant to be constructive criticism. I took the time to write this review not out of spite, but because I feel like this is a good game that could be amazing with a little fine tuning."

I will have a full review posted when I get a little further in.*A lot of people are going on about the graphics, but I feel the pixel artwork is a bit flat and unimpressive overall. Effective, but not the most memorable.The controls are pretty good, though I wish like hell it worked with the directional buttons on my gamepad and not just analog stick (found myself using a mock-PlayStation controller instead of my preferred X360 one). The jumping is definitely a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥at times, especially during the start of level 2 reaching certain ledges, but it's manageable.Infinite lives kind of kills some of the tension, though. Instead you lose half the skulls you find each death. There's small shops you can buy things at once per stage, which is handy, and often still work with how few you have unless you are terrible at platformer games in general and walk in with less than three. There's also the ""secret"" golden heart locations, and was cool with losing one upon death as an additional penalty given the aforementioned issue, making reaching the boss without dying something to strive for.The story is fairly basic, really, but level progression can sometimes be kind of cryptic. In one stage I found what looked like a hidden away stash of throwable weapons, using all to defeat a triceratops, only to find I screwed up and needed the woode arrows to reach the ledge you have to climb in order to finish the stage.Not the most unique 2D platformer, but still worth checking out. I find myself tackling this one as more of a casual experience thanks to the level save/select option, especially given the checkpoint system being at the end of one part of a certain level on the world map. I recomend it if you enjoy classic side-scrolling platformers like the titles mentioned above."
