76561198076346059,Recommended,407300,18885023,"Posted: 4 November, 2015",all,E.C. Mann,"The Last NightMary, developed by Submersivo Game Studio, doesn’t bring anything groundbreaking to the point-and-click genera, but it makes up for this with its narrative and intrigue.Most of the player’s time is spent wandering through misty marshlands, hunting for different clue items scattered throughout the maze. Oddly, despite looking quite nice, the maze’s layout isn’t very distinct, which resulted in me walking in a circle five times before getting anywhere.  But the satisfaction I felt when stumbling across a rotten fishing dock, or the aging ruins of a forsaken hut, made up for it.The puzzles are nothing to write home about. They don’t break from the norm, but they get the job done. Sometimes quantity surpasses quality. They’re simple, fun and they don’t hold your hand.The monster, again, is nothing special. He will occasionally present himself in random areas of the maze, sometimes through a guttural cry of agony, or a sudden leap from the tall grass. He isn’t too scary, per say, but knowing that he may appear at any moment forced me into an uneasy haste.I managed to beat The Last Nightmary in a little under an hour, BUT there is still a large majority of content I haven’t discovered yet. In fact, the game itself encourages players to run through it multiple times. I ended up with the ‘GOOD’ ending, but I’m definitely gonna give the game a few more tries.Lastly, the English translation isn’t the best. Anyone who’s grasped the language will spot a fair amount of mistranslations in the game’s text. But, seeing as this was developed by a group of college kids from Brazil, I’m still satisfied with the outcome.To sum it all up, The Last Nightmary is a fun, simple horror experience that should keep you interested from beginning to end. I assume you can soak up 3 to 4 hours of this game if you attempt to unlock all the endings and secrets. For its asking price, I’d say it’s worth a buy."

I like short, minimalist narrative games, and I like Brazilian culture, so I appreciate this game more than most people. If you don't like either of those things, this game won't change your mind.The Last NightMary: a Lenda do Cabeça de Cuia (literally: the legend of gourd head) is a short narrative game based on folklore famous in the Northeast Region of Brazil. Cabeça de Cuia is an undead monster, and he's out to kill the protagonist, who has been hallucinating about him for some time. The goal is to avoid capture, and find a way to put him to rest.Most of the gameplay is split between two sections, wandering a grassland maze, and light inventory puzzles. The maze is not very fun; there aren't many landmarks leading you to your destination, so its easy to get lost. There is no map screen, and if you pause to get your bearings, the monster is likely to come out of the bushes and attack you, giving you a few seconds to click to another part of the maze, or die. A map screen would have made it a lot more manageable, especially a real-time one to make it more tense with the monster chasing you.The inventory puzzles are easy, but fine. At first the puzzles are only in places where the protagonist is safe, but there are a small number in the maze later on. Interestingly, around 90% of the ""puzzles"" are simply looking for objects located in places around the environment. It's not quite a hidden object game, but it's reminiscent of them. Most of the true puzzles are thankfully straightforward. Match to lamp, knife to rope, battery to radio, etc. The last puzzle was very challenging, so much that I needed some hints to solve it. It wasn't something that I thought I would figure out in my own, but there was a type of logic to it that made it less frustrating than other adventure games.The art is very good. Many of the puzzle screens remind me of impressionist paintings, albeit morbid ones. The river in particular would make a great computer background. The way Cabeça de Cuia's previous victims are portrayed is very sad. It makes it easy to be sympathetic towards them, despite them not having any dialogue or any real interaction with you. Drowned Mary is particularly effective, I cringed when I saw what had happened to her.The sound design is decent as well. The sound effects do a good job of building tension, especially with the monster and other sudden sounds. There is occasionally music, which isn't bad, but isn't something I found particularly memorable. There is a surprising amount of voice acting as well. It's mostly fine, but the delivery leaves a bit to be desired. I'm not fluent in Portuguese (yet), but it feels like the actress was reading from a script and not in any actual danger.In summary, this game is actually not bad. It's a bit barebones, but shows high enough production value to be worth the price. I would for sure recommend it on a sale, and will be hoping for a new game from this developer."

,Recommended,407300,25988220,"Posted: 11 October, 2016",all,Audish,"I always get excited when we get horror from unexpected places. Zombies and vampires and long-haired Asian girls have pretty well run their course, but when was the last time you encountered a creature from Brazilian myth? The Last NightMary is just such a tale, pitting you against a bulbous, scampering thing in a deadly race against time. And just like a lot of races, it'll be over before you know it.You play a young woman named Mary, fresh off a troubled past and now stuck in the wrong place at the wrong time. The entire game takes place in fields of tall grass by a river and the one dilapidated shack out there, all of which factor into the story of the thing chasing you. I'll keep it vague but there's a thing you need to do to keep it from killing you, and it's steeped in mysticism you'll need to collect a handful of notes to understand.The Last NightMary plays like a first-person adventure game. Each scene can have elements to look at, items to take, and points to use those items on. However, much of your time is going to be spent scrambling around the fields, which form a maze of very samey clearings with the occasional point of interest. The one structure in the game is only four rooms as well, so in the end you're not going to be finding much to puzzle out. As a matter of fact I think there's only 10 or so items in the whole game. Also, I'm going to avoid spoiling anything about the monster but its effectiveness is short-lived once you puzzle out the simple mechanics behind it.You might be thinking this doesn't sound all that great, and indeed I was on the fence about recommending this game. The Last NightMary was the product of a game jam and it shows, being easily beatable in 20 minutes even on your first attempt. And yet I stuck with it for longer, poking into the details and corners and finding little secrets there. There are a mess of endings depending on what you find on your way to the conclusion, and a secret ending that takes plenty of effort to get but will please the Silent Hill fans in the audience.The art is perfectly serviceable for a game of this scope, especially the monster which manages to unsettle in his aggressive loping. The sound design helps with the proper horror moments, thanks to some clever tracks and well-placed stingers. Again, it's an incredibly short game with few hurdles to clear, but I enjoyed my time with it. There's more to unpack if you start delving into the many achievements, and even if you don't it's a fun, sometimes tense ride the first time through. Any horror fan looking for something new will get some mileage out of this lean little tale.Did you enjoy this review? I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope you'll check out more of them athttps://goldplatedgames.com/or on mycuration page!"
,Not Recommended,407300,33182852,Posted: 3 July,all,Jasyla,"I wanted to like this more than I did. The game is based on a Brazilan myth and you play Mary, a woman trying to escape a monster who is out to kill 7 virgins named Mary. You have to solve a couple inventory puzzles and listen to some journal entries to try to figure out how to escape or defeat the monster. There are multiple endings that you can experience.Sadly, the majority of the gameplay consists of wandering around a maze where everything looks pretty much the same. There's no map or anything to help you out, and if you stay in one place too long the monster will come for you. Being lost or not knowing where to go is my least favourite thing in games, so unfortunately I can't recommend this one."

The puzzles aren't all that complicated, it's more of a run around and collect things kind of game.The biggest knock against the game is how long it is. It took me just under an hour to complete it and get the  ""Good"" ending. There is some replay value in multiple endings as well as a new secret to uncover (No spoilers! :D) during the second playthrough.Altogether I'd say it was worth it and it gets my recommend, but beware that it is somewhat of a short adventure!"

They said that the curse will finish only when the beast successfully catches and kill seven Virgin Mary, but maybe there is another way to defeat this terrible beast.The Last NightMary – A lenda do Cabeça de Cuia is a point and click survival genre game, based on a local regional legend from the State of Piaui, Brazil. The player will be Maria and needs to find a way to escape from Crispim (The beast), avoiding to be another victim of this curse.Release Date: 2 Nov, 2015The GameplayThere are 5 different endings, you have to restart and do all of them to fully complete the game. Part of it is a ritual you have to perform to reach most of the endings. There seem to be no clues whatsoever to get the correct combination and I've calculated that there are 720 possible permutations. In my opinion that's unfeasible without consulting a guide. Perhaps I missed some vital clue but I don't think so - I have all achievements and seen everything there is to see in the game.The storyline is above average for this type of thing, probably due to the fact that it's a real legend and the game has been built around it rather than some lame tale made up by the developer and stuffed into the gameplay just-because.

,Recommended,407300,29784876,Posted: 8 February,all,bcmattos,"The LastNightMary is less-than-great horror point-and-click, its major flaw being the unintentional (I guess) aesthetical similarity of most areas in the game. Still, it manages to create a ghastly atmosphere in which one never feels entirely safe; a surprising achievement for such a low-budgeted indie game.Positive aspects include carefully crafted close-up screens and local folklore elements, all working together to make this short game an unique experience. Some Brazilian players may also find the voice acting a little exotic, as Piauí's accent (from the same province where the Cabeça de Cuia legend originated) is not often heard on mainstream media - an aspect that helps to enhance the overall mood.All in all, this videogame may be compared to Zé do Caixão (Coffin Joe)’s movies: technical limitations are part of its DNA, and otherwise it wouldn’t be half as interesting as it is. I'm glad to hear that a new game from the same developers is already on the way."

Not quite, the puzzles are non-intuitive, the mechanics are basic and most of the game is ""click around till you find that little hitbox you can't see, yet need"". However, when reviewing the game for what it is, a graduate project, it's quite good.Art is nicely done, even if main antagonist is not that scary, but that might be overexposure to horror from our end. Story is well executed and even if translation is not spot on 100% of the time, the fact they bothered to translate to so many languages at all is on itself, remarkable.Worth the full price, and certainly worth it with the 85% discount I got it, would play another game from these guys, that had more budget."

,Recommended,407300,23197968,"Posted: 25 May, 2016",all,Lowbacca1977,"The Last NightMary is a relatively simple horror game, with a little bit of replayability, particularly for achievements and alternate endings, with each runthrough talking 10-20 minutes.To start off with the problems, firstly, the game would, even though it's short, benefit from a save function, and I found the lack of that rather frustrating, particularly as it's tough to skip through the opening text. I played the game in windowed mode, and I did also find some issues with some text, especially during the endings, being cut off. I didn't try it in full screen, so that may be a better option for gameplay. Finally, the last problem that really shows up is that the game was originally in Portuguese, and while the translation is mostly good, there's still some problems, and the endings and journal entries, in particular, really could have improved writing to flow better in English.All that said, the game is ultimately meant to be scary, and the game goes about it in a way that is fairly straightforward, but really effective. The sound of the demon (of sorts) in the game approaching is fairly unpredictable (if not random), but it gives the game a frantic pace, and since I started playing this in the middle of the night, it did a good enough job for me to stop playing until it would be daylight.Overall, for a few bucks it's a decent (although not great) storyline and a pretty effective scare the first few run throughs."

The monster was boring and didn't really prevent me from getting through the game at all. I don't want to sound too harsh, but it just didn't leave a good taste in my mouth, in a way that a horror game should. The point and click style was alright, didn't really get fleshed out as much as I'd like. Scenary was drawn well, albeit repeatative. Translation was the worse part. I understand it's by developers that don't speak English as their first language, and it's not an English focused game, I am fine reading subtitles but the translation from Portuguese to English was God awful. The context and tense in the language was messed up to the point that it took away from any horror/creepiness the game even possessed.TL;DR - Game is not that great. Unoriginal. Story is forgettable. Not really worth $7 IMO. Try The Park for a better short horror game."

The main game moves along through two maps. The first is an outdoors map where the only real landmarks are a random plant or one of six dead Mary's strewn about as your being chased by a ""demon"", and the other a log cabin where you have to perorm a ritual in order to survive. It's easy to get lost in the first map, not to mention overlook the key you need, and that's the biggest flaw. No map exists, so you have to rely on memory in a land that all looks the same.Other than the fairly bland surroundings, the game's mechanics work well enough. You click the direction you want to go at key spots on the screen, you pick up items like a hidden object style title, and solve random puzzles in typical adventure game fashion, once in a while relying on you to combine things you picked up. The soundtrack isn't bad either, and the monster that chases you isn't all that bad.I received both the bad ending and the good ending, and have litlle interest in playing it again to get the ""alien"" object. But, if you pick this up, know that there are walkthroughs that will help you find the items and paths you need (mostly in Russian though) so use them like I had to in order to figure out what I need and overlooked."

There are many endings, some good, some bad, some grisly; and no one is getting out of this without a little blood on their hands.Since I bought this game awhile ago, and then forgot I even had it, I had NO idea what to expect once I got to booting it up, but WOW did I ever not expect this; it harkens back to memories of playing Clocktower back on the super famicom - And in more ways then you'd expect - and believe me that is DEFINITELY not a bad thing!But don't take my word for it; give it a shot yourself or, even better, check out my video for it!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiXgDHojX24"

Definitely turn out the lights and use headphones.It'll take couple of hours if you want to get ALL the content.  All the achievements?  Be ready for a grind.

The story you see in the beginning is not English (atleast subtitles are available in a few languages) and it's not good explained. Only a small part of the background of the monster is told, which is far from enough to succeed in the game in the first try. It's not really horror or thriller, once the monster has it's eye on you you will hear the sound of a heart that is beating and you will be dead, a few seconds later. Once you're game over you need to start all over again, from the start menu... and this is why I think it would have been really important to get the players much more information about the monster. I would recommend it as the content is fine for it's price."

Just don't buy it, for any priceThis game is so bad, that when I erased it, I made sure to erase it in low-level format, multiple times, so that no trace would be left. Cons:* VERY short. The 1.6 hours is really due to a the game being mostly a maze, and you need to backtrack multiple times. The acutal ""net"" time of this game is *maybe* 15-20 minutes. No more.* The ""story"", if you want to call it that, is super short, and mostly revealed in the end* There are ""multiple"" endings, that differ slightly, and arbitrarily* No ""save-game"" option, so you have to replay the maze to get at the other endings. And.... it really, really isn't worth the time."
