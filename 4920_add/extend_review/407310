,Recommended,407310,31754792,Posted: 14 May,all,✩ Helenα ✩,"A short and cute visual novel about ninja catgirls. It’s mostly kinetic, and there’s only two times where you get to chose one of the options. That won’t change the incoming of the story, it only unlocks two CGs related to the two girls.Speaking of them, Tama and Yura are very cute! The art style fits the story perfectly and the VA is great. I liked that only their ears “twitch”, for some reason I found that charming, lol.Their elder sister, Nachi, is also a nice character and I found myself wanting to know more about her. I just wished that the other demi-humans had sprites as well.I played the censored version here on Steam, but there’s a patch that gives you extra R18 scenes. It’s on the website Denpasoft, and you have to pay for it.8/10. I recommend this visual novel if you want to read something heartwarming and not too complex. Hopefully there will be a sequel someday."

I also bought the H-Patch from the Denpasoft website and yes, I did play through all the H-scenes on my route. Now, onto the review. No spoilers, I promise.This game is nothing special, Visual Novel wise, but sometimes that's exactly what you're looking for. It certainly was what I was looking for, coming into this. People have been comparing this to NekoPara and personally, while I liked NekoPara better, Neko Nin is still pretty good. It's got a very light and fluffy storyline, filled with the heartwarming, cute and funny tropes you tend to expect from this kind of thing. The H-scenes came often and sometimes out of the blue, but hey, you're not playing this for plot, are you? For a VN, this is pretty quality art, and I especially loved that the catgirls' ears twitch randomly when you talk to them. This is a Visual Novel as opposed to a Kinetic Novel, so there are choices to make, but I get the feeling that the choices just unlock different H-scenes.As I said above, you should not be playing this for plot. You're playing this for something light and cute, with stupidly adorable scenes, a few tongue-in-cheek jokes, and the warmth of two somewhat ditzy catgirl ninjas. The main character is almost stupidly stereotypical, and what passes for story is basically just a set-up to introduce two potential future heroines (if the game ever gets a sequel) and an excuse to make you feel warm and fuzzy. This isn't bad, mind you, but there are times where the game went a little over-the-top. It's not just that plot wasn't really coherent; it's also that all the pieces of a super typical romcom anime were tossed together and stirred, but not quite completely.Still, I'd recommend this game to anyone who wants to pass a little time in good, happy, but not quite wholesome fun. It's definitely worth playing for its price, and it definitely helped feed my neverending need for Visual Novels. Just don't go in expecting some soul-gripping, heart-moving, teary-eyed epic, and you'll be set.Pros:-Great art-Cute and fluffy storyline-H-Scenes galore-Nekos-Nins-Can be played with one handCons:-Super stereotypical MC-Super stereotypical plot set up-No seriousness at all-Can't H-scene all the girls, please gib sequel-Tissues not included"
,Recommended,407310,31284706,Posted: 21 April,all,SegGel2009,Very cute catgirl visual novel to play while you wait for Nekopara Vol. 3. However it one ups Nekopara by having ninjas and the 18+ patch cost $5 as opposed to $10. Plus the plot is interesting.Found it funny that the space key hides the menu and Esc minimizes the game. Kinda convenient that last one if you bought the 18+ Patch.

As long as you don't go into this game expecting it to be on par with Nekopara in both an erotic and non-erotic sense, you'll have a decent enough time."

76561198086932500,Recommended,407310,31350864,Posted: 24 April,all,James12183,"Neko-Nin is a short yet decent Visual Novel. It is about two sisters who are cat demi-humans, who show up on the main character Haruki's doorstep proclaiming that they are Shinobi from the Fuuma village born to serve him. They are Yura(Older Sister) and Tama(Younger Sister) Fuuma. At first reluctant Haruki ends up taking the two sisters in gradually growing closer to them as time passes.The story, while short, is good and has quite a bit of humor. It should be noted there are only two choices in it. The music is decent and the graphics are good as well. The voice acting is also done well. I personally give the Visual Novel a 9/10."
76561198069159152,Recommended,407310,33780937,Posted: 24 July,all,wrb41977,"This is a cute little game that seems to be set in an alternate universe from the Nekopara tales. Among the differences are that there are two choices in this game (though they only seem to serve to unlock CGs). Anyway, if you like catgirls, ninjas, fun tales, or fun tales about catgirl ninjas, this is a game you will like.There appears to be an explicit patch out there, but as I have not acquired it, I cannot say if it adds anything to the story..."
,Recommended,407310,32996016,Posted: 29 June,all,Cr1m50nD3ath,"Currently playing through this visual novel only just got up to the first choice so far but, overall enjoying it as the art work is beautiful"
,Recommended,407310,31442857,Posted: 29 April,all,Yuudachi,"I'm kinda biased towards Nekopara but this is still one of the most sugoi kawaii desu ne games I have ever seen. If you're done with Nekopara but still want to fap to Nekos, look no further.The art and voices are good, and so far the story seems... interesting. It's about this guy, right, and 2 ninja catgirls just kinda show up at his house one day saying that he is their master. They start following him to school and stuff, so then, he basically kicks them out, m'kay, and says he doesn't need them, and then they're sad, and then he feels bad, and I'm assuming they're gonna bang, but I'm not that far yet.Honestly I think the story was designed to be cute and the game is more about the kawaii nekos than the story. There seems to be a lot of filler which only exists for more oppai viewing time and kawaii voices. There aren't as many jokes or innuendos as Nekopara (at least so far), but you can get the 18+ patch so there will be plenty of, ah, adult content, later on.Anyway, is it as good as Nekopara? No. Worth 10 bucks? Probably. An overall enjoyable experience? Yes (at least for me). Therefore my conclusion is: If you haven't played Nekopara yet, do that first, but once you've finished, go for it."

76561198173938506,Not Recommended,407310,31552326,Posted: 4 May,all,Japanese Mapping,"Alright, so this is my second attempt at making a review about this game. Why is it my second? Well, the first one was basically me ranting and insulting everyone who played or even stood up against me and spoiling some segments of the game itself, for that I apologise to whoever read it and commented on it. But regardless here it is.Pros :Cute- If you really love cute maybe underaged girls then go for it. (Yes I am aware this is Japan we are talking about)Nekos- Pretty much says it by itself. (Although get Nekopara since there is more varietyArt (Backgrounds & Music)- It was pretty good in all honesty, I was really expecting it to have no music in it at all, however it did and it really does blend it with the tone, enviroment and the mood of the on-going story. However its almost only half the time for me.Cons : (My fav ;3)Story- Pretty average, doesn't really make any sense sometimes. Its almost like when you watch a Michael Bay film except its with cute catgirls and Shia or Matt Damon were a teenage boy,Sounds that the girls make-  Well this wouldn't really annoy everyone until it happens again and again. I get it that their cats and their supposed to be cat-like. But lets agree for a second that having a annoying sound constantly repeating itself again and again in your earbuds or headphones pretty much gets annoying overtime.Final Result :I give this a 3/10. Thats all, but if you want to purchase it maybe wait for a steam sale? Or just get it with its normal price tag. Although you could by IMHW for even cheaper price but hey, thats just my opinion. And to my friend who bought me this game. Yes, I will give you another horrid game title, probably one about Sonic since you like him so much. And I am still giving this game thumbsdown. Thats all."

If you don't like them basically immediately their is probably something wrong with you. For the price their is certainly enough great content here. Also if you want the H-scenes you can get the patch from denpasoft."

I can see the work that went into this game, it has great art and even pretty much full voice acting. But I do not believe it was really worth what I paid for it. Even if the price does seem like a small amount to some, the game was just way too short for it to feel like it was worth it to me, I completed 100% in a little over an hour. I'm used to even free visual novels lasting me an afternoon or possibly a full day.Going back to the store page, you can almost watch a full playthrough excluding the dialogue by watching the lil trailer."

,Recommended,407310,31340372,Posted: 24 April,all,DaVietWeeaboo,"So essentially, I was playing OSU when I came across a particular beatmap which turns out to be the OP for Neko-nin exHeart. I found the video to feel like a visual novel game considering the still images of the characters. So I did a bit of digging and found out that this game was on steam so I instantly bought it *cough* Catgirls are the best *cough*So the overall pros and cons are:Pros-Neko Girls-Ninja Girls-LewdsObviously DLC for this time and age-Fun characters-Cheery BGMMy only con so far in my 14 min play through are that the frame rate seems to be low and it heavily resembles Nekopara an already existing Cat Girl visual novel. But however, this does not prevent the game from not been enjoyable.I would recommend this to anyone even Nekopara players due to it as something to play while waiting for the anticipated Vol. 3.P.S This review will change as I play more of the game"
,Recommended,407310,31323922,Posted: 23 April,all,DJHarmony,"There are only two things I need to say about this game to make it recommendable:1. It has Neko girls2. They are ninjasBeing blunt though, it's not perfect. The story feels a little bit rushed and sometimes the girls can have pretty repetitive dialogue, but other than that I'd say this is a good one. They take advantage of the cuteness of nekos and it's really hard not to fall for these girls. There is also of course the 18+ patch as well, and while it may not be available on Steam, it's not hard to acquire it elsewhere. Trust me, it's worth it."
