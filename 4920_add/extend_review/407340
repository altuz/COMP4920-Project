,Not Recommended,407340,30841946,Posted: 30 March,all,A Pocketful of Stars,"+ Beautiful artwork+ HUGE variety of food, complete with delicious-looking CGs+ Cute romance plotlines+ Lots of endings, including friendship routes- Stiff and unfunny writing- Gets repetitive- Soundtrack gets annoying after a whileI came here after playing and enjoying Ebihime's other GL visual novel, Asphyxia. Unfortunately, I didn't have quite such a good experience with Strawberry Vinegar. The formal, stilted dialogue that worked well in Asphyxia's Romantic poet-inspired world is just bizarre in the mouths of modern adults and children. In Rie's case she's meant to be unusually mature for a child, but even a precocious 9 year-old isn't going to say things like, ""Spare me your sentimentality"", or ""A neat little sophism that encourages the importance of family meals."" It would be *slightly* less weird if the main characters were at least teens, or if people found the way she talked hilarious or cringeworthy, but she's taken completely seriously.Rie is a fairly classic kuudere type who sometimes comes off as more bratty than charming. Her behaviour is rarely called out unless you're *so* awful to people you get one of the many bad endings. This is especially noticeable with her attitude toward her stay-at-home dad. His treatment in the narrative is grating, with an uncomfortable refrain of ""get back in your gender role."" Rie frequently references his lack of self-respect, including to his face, and at one point says his apron would be ""perfectly fine―if you were a woman."" Really, Rie?The rest of the writing is a mixed bag. Rie and Licia are genuinely adorable together, as are Rie's parents, who make an odd sort of beta couple. The culinary writing is a bit lacklustre―this is no Chocolat―but the sheer variety of food makes the eating segments some of the most enjoyable. It helps that the artist did a great job on the CGs. On the flip side, the story can't quite seem to decide what tone it wants to take. For something about a little girl making friends with a demon through the joys of food, the story dips into weirdly dark territory. There are multiple endings where you can actually die, and at one point Rie's mother randomly waxes philosophical about the horrible origins of Rie's name and how having children is self-centered. (Thanks, mom?) There's a jaded edge to the narrative that's jarring against the goofy baking shenanigans, and the two sides never reconcile into anything cohesive.My main problem is the slow pacing. The same jokes and character interactions occur over and over again without adding anything to the story. Rie overanalyzes *every* line anyone says, which interrupts the dialogue and drags things out even more. Overthinking things is part of her character, yes, but that doesn't make it any more enjoyable to read her umpteenth internal monologue. By the time I got to the romantic climax of the best ending, I just wanted to hold down the skip button.TL;DR: If cute girls and tasty-looking pictures of Japanese cuisine are all you're after, Strawberry Vinegar will suit you just fine. Sadly the flaws in the writing kept me from enjoying it."

,Recommended,407340,29125861,Posted: 8 January,all,WeatheredPeach,"I love this game to pieces. It's a nice little game about a nine year old girl, far too mature and cynical for her age, who gets forced into cooking for a little demon. The writing is great, providing both charming characters and fun humor, as well as descriptions of food that makes you want to try eat the screen. As a slice-of-life VN it works really great, and the epilogues were surprisingly rewarding. (Wish there was more epilogue, I want to see even more of that romance.)One thing I personally would want to highlight is the parents of the main characters and the relationship they share. The mother and father are living in a BDSM relationship that seems to impact every aspect of their everyday life, something their daughter notices and reflects on. The father is really submissive, and basically functions as a cute housewife living to serve his mistress. The childs perspective on their parents BDSM relationship is really interesting in itself, and her insight provides some character growth to her parents. I really wasn't expecting this from a yuri VN that seemed to only be about fluff and food, but I adored what I got.One of my main personal negatives would be the age of the main characters. With characters as young as nine years old I found it hard to relate to the romance. However, with them both being far too mature for their age it never felt like they were as child-like as you would expect children who actually were nine, so that could really help those of us who have a hard time relating to romance between kids. (And the epilogue is fantastic, which totally helps. Did I mention the epilogue being good?)(For anyone ever planning on making their own game like this:) The user interface can't seem to decide on whether to call the settings for ""Preferences"" or ""Options"". This is a minor problem with a minor fix; having consistent naming for screens and tools in UIs generally makes using it flow more smoothly for users."

The humor really feels forced, the romance too.I quite forced myself to finish it, in hope of seeing something interesting.

Also it doesn't have a serious plot but instead  gives you a sweet, fluffy, heartwarming and charming story of two cute girls who gains friendship and eats lots of nice looking food.Artwork is very nice, it gives you lots of CGs, although most of it focuses on the dishes itself as a warning.

It's actually pretty sad because she and her mother treat the father like an idiot (whom they both call an idiot) and he kind of is. Also, gender roles are reversed and though I usually welcome something so refreshing the way this game portrayed it was a little cringeworthy.The positives?

,Recommended,407340,34047086,Posted: 5 August,all,niX,"Incredibly cute VN that shifts the focus on romantic relationships between adults to the budding friendship between two children.Strawberry Vinegar features a 9 year old girl named Rie who is responsible, cynical and deep down very lonely. She is one day visited by Licia - a demon from Hell. Licia demands that Rie make her delicious food throughout the course of a week or she will reap her soul. Licia is here on a ""vacation"" to see what earth is like, and Rie becomes her caregiver throughout the course of a six day period. Although resisitive to having Licia around at first, Rie is unable to resist Licia's innocent, friendly and loving nature and learns that having a friend isn't so bad after all. The two girls bond through their mutual love of food and through their opposite but also complimentary personalities.The game has great music, cute and colorful artwork and backgrounds, and features tons of photos of yummy looking food! The photos of the food and ebi-hime's descriptions made me feel really hungry. To read through all of the unique dialogue, it took me about 4 hours in total. There are a total of 5 different endings, a wide variety of gallery art, and also additional things such as: concept art, cut content that never made it into the game, and the writer's thoughts on each character.Would recommend to those who like a very tame and light hearted VN (no swearing, nudity, etc), and for those who like ebi-hime's other workings."

,Recommended,407340,21105693,"Posted: 10 February, 2016",all,Reimu☆rena~,"Strawberry Vinegar Full ReviewThis VN is about a 9 year old girlRiewho meets a “demon”Liciawho is about the same as her age and yes, she is also from a place called “Hell”. The demon says to stay at her home for 6 days (as apparently there is only 6 days in hell, not 7). They both get to know each other, first they start to hate each other, but later in the VN, they start to love each other and show affection to each other. I mean, it even gets to the point where you think a Yuri scene is about to pop up any moment….I mean there are some that do, so don’t be disappointed(I definitely bought this for the plot, right?)Graphics: 9/10If you have read the Visual Novels’ Asphyxia and/or The Sad Story of Emmeline Burns you might be familiar with the graphics, as they are made by the same people. The artwork really shows bright images of the girls and the environment they’re in, they did a great job in terms of the visuals in this novel. The drawing of the girls doesn’t really follow the same “anime-like” appearance as other VNs, which felt unique in its own way, but it also felt “out of place” for me as I wasn’t quite used to it at the beginning.But overall it delivers a nice artwork for the characters and the environment, great job on this one.Storyline: 8/10I have already mentioned some of it above. But in terms of “in depth story” it doesn’t go far and long, in fact this VN has really fast pacing and really quick character development, so if you wanted a long, in depth story VN, sadly this is not for you. But for the others, it delivers a nice empathises on both of the girls as they go on about their day. Also, to mentionRiemade her first friend EVER! In her life, that is of course the demon she met, who broke into her home and started eating cookies…well, I guess you can also make friends that way huh, who would’ve thought.Overall, the novel shows us a story of two girls who show love and affection to each other as the VN progresses on and it portrays their everyday life and show their own personal character development.Sound: 4/10Nothing of the amazing to hear in this novel, there is only ever so many soundtracks until you start hearing the same ones that you heard 2-3 scenes ago. However, some are really nicely done, but I wouldn’t say all of them are of “high quality” though. Some of the soundtracks don’t even fit particular scenes, but eh, what can you do?Overall, the soundtrack is quite a let-down. It doesn’t offer much for the reader as some don’t even match the scene.Gameplay: 9/10The VN offers the basic options in the menu which could alterate your VN experience. It at least has the SHIFT + TAB overlay support which I really liked, but it only worked when you had a high enough frame rate (Between 30-60 FPS), otherwise it wouldn’t function, or sometimes it would work, but it would lag the game or lag the overlay.Overall, it only offers basic options and gameplay aspects. But this is enough for this kind of VN.Price: 10/10At £6.99 this is a great price for this VN. Any higher than £10 would not have been worth buying at all. This is great to see as many VNs of this length are overpriced despite offering the same features, I’ll give this VN full marks here.Overall at the price, you get what you pay for, it’s not too low or too high. This is a great price point for this VN.ConclusionIt is a decent VN with good artworks and a taste of Yuri. That is all I can say for that one. I can only recommend the VN if you are into fast paced stories, cute girls and VNs in general. This is NOT for the “serious” reader if you know what I mean."

The plot is very cut and dry and doesn't really try anything new, but the artwork is really nice and the characters are all likeable. If you see on sale try it.One thing I'd like to suggest however, is that with the heavy reliance on food (what you decide to feed Licia decides whether she likes you or not) it would have been cool if there was a list of recipes in the extras that get unlocked when you make that recipe in game. Doesn't affect the gameplay, but I thought of it while I was playing and I'm kind of sad that the dev didn't do that."

Worth full price and definitely worth buying when cheaper especially compared to Ebi-Hime's previous work.First off as background, I have been a fan of Ebi-Hime's work for years. I have played through Asphyxia, The Way We All Go, and The Sad Story of Emmeline Burns. I have played through various visual novels and have been an avid anime fan since my childhood. I also bought this game for 50% off a long time ago. As of my writing this review, I have read through four out of six endings.If there's one thing that is particular that has always been a strength in Ebi-Hime's work, it is the writing. Whenever I read other visual novels, you could always tell they were translated not as well as they could have been. Whether there was a cultural joke that needed additional explanations, a phrase was not stated as eloquently, and etc... Ebi-Hime's work always feels like it's written by a native English speaker. Besides that, her characters are great as always. Each character has individual qualities that make them memorable. A lot of detail was put into each character, and even side characters have their own moments of glory.Besides that, the animation is beautiful as you can see from the trailer. The music is stunning, and they match the scenes really really well. Props to the team!Edit: I have been informed that Ebi-Hime is a native speaker. She's a good researcher for knowing so much about Japanese culture!"

While not long, it is stuffed full of beautiful art, cute characters, delicious food, and good feels.  I caught some bad ends early on and while that could have been frustrating under most circumstances, the way they were delivered made me realize that I had to think about how my character would act for each choice, as a gloomy reclusive 9-year-old girl.  That realization helped me feel more invested in the characters and in guiding them well.The CG art is beautiful and plentiful, featuring some of the most beautiful hand-drawn renders I have seen.  The character sprites are expressive and varied.  The music, while it doesn't stand out, suits the scenes and events perfectly.  The characters themselves are interesting and engaging, although they may not be as easy to identify with for someone not familiar with anime tropes.I chose to play one game ""day"" per real day.  This made the individual play sessions no more than an hour, but each day as work wound down I found myself looking forward to getting home so I could play again.  I do strongly recommend this game.However, despite the high production values, at a release price of 10USD I feel the game would be better served listing a few dollars cheaper, due to its brevity.  My second recommendation is to wishlist the game, and buy it as soon as it receives a discount, because the experience it delivers really is very very good."

The 2 main characters are well developed and the choices you make have a real effect on the storyline. More of a coming of age/slice of life story than a yuri VN, since the 2 major players are 9 year olds (spoiler - some endings have them grown up for a few pages). The artwork was cute and well done. Many references to Japanese foods, with very vivid descriptions of the dishes. Keep snacks handy or you might be distracted by a rumbling stomach :)  It didn't take me as long to finish as my in-game time shows. I wandered off and left it running a couple times. Probably more like 4-6 hours of playtime to get all of the endings, which is greatly helped by a skip button that allows you to fast forward once you've been through a scene once. Highly recommended."
