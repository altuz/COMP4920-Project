But the problems with Gabe Newell Simulator go far beyond what could be excused by it being in Early Access.The image for this game alone sums up pretty well all the problems with this game. The entire games quality is poor. No quality control whatsoever.Here's all the issues:- Full-screen doesn't work. It changes were the cursor clicks by around 2 inches.- The menu for the game looks like it was created within 3 minutes.- The controls/how to play section was literally made in paint.- Level menu lets you skip levels even when you've never played/completed them.- Level menu constantly doesn't show levels.- Text in the cut-scenes look like they've been made in Windows Movie Maker.- The game is laggy and badly optimised, no matter the computer or graphic settings you used.- Level layouts are very bare-bones and simple.- The AI are so unresponsive you can run straight by them and complete each and every level.- There's no audio in the entire game except the starting cut-scene and gun sounds.If you want to see all of this and more for yourself, check here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=18&v=Wwi2xuKcUpoTLDR;Game is broken in full-screen. Game is sluggish. Menu is bare-bones. Cut-screen text is unreadable. Gameplay is mostly unresponsive and irritating. No quality control. Game can't hold your attention at all.Thank Gaben for Steam Refunds."

,Not Recommended,407420,21541121,"Posted: 28 February, 2016",all,Redbeard,"All of the reviews I saw about Gabe Newell Simulator said that it was awful.But I thought ""No worries, at least it will be a bit of a laugh"".Boy, was I wrong!I should have paid heed to the wise advice of the reviewers who told me to keep away from it.But did I listen to the voice of experience? No, I did not - and I suffered for it.There are two modes of play: ""Story Mode"" and ""Steam Mode"".The ""Steam Mode"" gives you a number of click options, as if you are running the Valve company.Release Half Life 3 and your money count starts to go up.Then you can upgrade your games, to make more money.For what purpose? To see some big money numbers? Very pointless.Then there is the ""Story Mode"", which is the main game.You can select a level, from 1-2 and 4-7 (the game is missing level 3 - no idea why).First off, make sure that you set the screen size to your computer's settings.I know that probably sounds obvious, but with every other game I've played the game itself would automatically choose the best screen size for you; but not so with this one.I spent some time playing this game on the wrong screen size.This not only meant that I could not read all of the relevant text, but I couldn't play level 1 either.For level 1, when I had the incorrect screen size setting, a text-based announcement (the first screen) was as far as I could go; there was no option whatsoever to do anything.Once the screen size had been fixed, you could see a ""Skip"" button to click on to continue.(But, as it turned out, I probably shouldn't have bothered.)Finally, with the game screen widened, I could play level 1.Level 1 starts with a dark theatre, which then goes to a screen which inicated that Half Life 3 to be released.Unfortunately, this scene can't be skipped, so if you are going to play level 1 again (which can only be done by closing and restarting the programme), you have to sit through it all again (which is annoying).In level 1, you start off as Gabe Newell, in his office at Valve.There is a pistol on the table - pick it up by using the E key.You can engage in some text-based dialogue with a guy in your office.You pick up a rifle from the next office.If the rifle doesn't pick up straight away, keep hitting E on the keyboard (and move around a bit beside the gun whilst doing so, to make sure you are in the right position).Then you get to shoot an overgrown moth, and then some other aliens.I spent some time clicking away at the aliens, but my guns wouldn't shoot.It turns out that you have to right-click to aim to shoot - as, in this game, you can't shoot off the hip at all.(I would have known that if I did the training with the correct screen size).There was one alien standing in a room who I shot at through the open doorway (emptying an entire magazine) but who wouldn't die - it turns out you have to be in the same room as him to kill him (go figure).I tried the other levels as well, but . . . yawn.The game isn't thrilling at all.There is an attempt at humour when you engage in some text-based dialogue with the guy in your office, but it's not particularly amusing.I was thinking that the one saving grace of this game would be some brilliant humour (hey, even some half-decent humour would have sufficed), but it just wasn't funny.Quite frankly, Gabe Newell Simulator is a rubbish game.The game play is poor.The sound effects and ambience are not much chop.The graphics are usable, but that's about it.Luckily, I bought this for next-to-nothing on a Steam sale.It would be a sad occurrence if you paid full price for it.My advice is to steer well clear of this rubbish game."

I had a dream once to create a game . I worked for so long and it was all gone . Seeing that screen made me remember the horrors from my past . The pain I went through when all the hard work was gone ;(  . I took a second chance at making a game when I was all alone with no internet . I torrented a lot of Unity Assets when I worked on my first game . Fisting fury was its name . . Than there was lost smiff and now my masterpiece .

So anyways I launch Up the game I was reminded of everything , I sa the default unity menu and buttons . The poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ didnt put time in actually animating anything well atleast take that ga y default text box . So I get in the game the model is crap very low polly . I was speechless my arms were shaking the thoughts andmemories of my ga y cousin bothered me as I pressed the W key to walk to a man . A Dialouge chat appears . My heart sank I collapsed to the floor I woke up a few hours later . He torrented the assets , Just Like me ?The exact same dialouge that was in my game was in here . Same font , same color , same everything . I couldnt believe it . The ♥♥♥♥er was so lazy that he used the default ont and everyhing for his release . I was almost in tears . As I walked I noticed the mouse was on my screen . The guy didnt know how to script ;{ he didnt know the simple script to lock the mouse . I then noticed the crosshair was the default crosshair from the dialouge Asset package . I was]lked and I shot some bugs . My friend on skype had already been killed by the bugs . The boredom grew inside me . I quit the game and tried to open my game I was working on . Its gone , its all gone all of my Builds everything . How could I been so foolish ?I was about to write a review I noticed a link to the guys youtube . My face had no expression . I looked at this 14 year old pinochio as he spoke some language I have never heard before .I am writting this review as I am reimporting all of my assets into Unity . After seeing all of the horrible games on steam and after I have played this ""game"" I am uploading my game to greenlight ."

Sure Gaben is a funny guy, but just because he's a hilarious as a person doesn't make this game worth a buy."

Gaben arives on the scene of G3 to reveal the greatest masterwork mankind has ever wrought with two hands: ""Half Life 3"" when suddenly the aliens attack, slaughtering the crowd like cattle. It is now up to Gaben to bring peace to the universe and steal back the master copy of Half Life 3 from the aliens before they can discover the secrets embedded in the very code of the game.-Pros:-Next Gen Graphics (On par with the PS5, and Xbox 2): Literally blew my eyes out of the back of my head.-Audio: The music throughout the game set the tempo for an action packed adventure through the life of Gaben, not to discredit the amazing sound effects provided by the studio throughout the game punctuating each moment with a sense of tangible realism.-Fantastic Gameplay: The gunplay and intelligent design/interactivity of each level is perfectly balanced and leaves no regrets to my mind as to lost potential.-Well crafted story: as above this game is surely one of the greatest narratives of our time, I found myself compelled to cry, laugh, and rejoice at each twist and turn in the shoes of our great lord and savior.-Amazing Value: At a pricepoint of a mere few dollars this game surely outweighs even TF2 in value to gameplay metrics, rising above other simulations as an economical and truly great game.-Cons:-Immersion: Although the graphics and sound were amazingly crafted, surely with love in mind, I found myself in a difficult situation. I cannot for an instant believe that I could, even through such a surely amazing simulation draw myself in comparison with our mighty lord and savior, Gaben.7/10- IGN ""Could have used more boobs"""

So I don't agree that all the good games are hidden by piles of bad games on Steam. I feel like that's an easy thing to say when you're a game dev that worked hard on a game that just ins't selling. It's a get out of jail free card.Stardew Valley, Pixel Privateers, StarBound, Turbo Pug (OK, I made that one, a bit cheeky. Turbo Pug isn't in the same league as these other games listed here), or more recently The Wild Eight. None of these games have a problem with visibility. So try again.This game is a prime example of why I disagree with the idea of strict quality control on Steam. Played for 2 minutes,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥myself laughing.

There's also a wide variety ofweapons, like pistols, ak-47, assault rifles and every conventional weapon you can imagine, but the most effective weapon this game has is thegameplayitself. It has one of the most intuitive control schemes I have recently seen, thus it does not have, or even need, a controls menu. The UI is also carefully sewn in order to display the most amount of information while not being obstructingat all.10/10Worth the weight."

This Game should be given to childen in all schools just for its depth of story telling, the music in the game even has its own audible tale!The graphics are sublime, it is clearly Souce engine 5, the unity logo must be a ruse to through you off so you dont question why the other source games have been updated. You can tell by both the frame rate and the detail in the game, it must be running at around 120fps. And for the details, you just have to look at the floor or the sky. The floor has small marks and scuffs that a normal floor would but most games would miss out, the sky looks a deep grey but when you closely inspect ityou can see thousands of different shades to give it the true to life English sky.But do you want to know what the worst part about this game is???Its the last game of its type, no game will ever compare to this. After playing only an hour of it I begun to weep as I knew this was THE best game that has ever existed and ever will exist.- Lardy999 ofInsomniacgamers.net"
