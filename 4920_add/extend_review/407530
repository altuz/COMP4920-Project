It's a nice way to ease into it as Evolved is a bit more difficult (and frustrating). It's also just a fun game; basically the Hunger Games with dinosaurs. And it's free, so why not?I don't have any real negative points, just that you need a pretty decent computer to run it, so a lower graphics setting might be necessary."

I for a time did enjoy it just as much and that's not saying I think it's a bad game, what it is saying is I'm just too casual for the competitive nature and pacing of the game, it is in short a much faster paced version of Survival Evolved and goes at a pace that I just can't match close enough to be good at it. But if you are into the arena style games then I can say that this does make ARK fit into that style just as well as any other game could, you all start in the middle and then fight to be the last!!!"

,Recommended,407530,29086735,Posted: 7 January,all,el chapo,"ARK: Survival of the Fittest is a survival arena ""esport"". It resembles the Hunger Games trilogy, you start falling from the sky into platforms, and from there your only goal is to survive.Many people didn't get the ""survive"" part of it, since it is one of the most quick-paced and hardcore games there is of its kind. The learning curve is extremely steep, with no tutorials nor guides to follow from the developers themselves. Most players quitted and the amount of people that played lowered exponentially, since it wasn't fun for unexperienced players with no learning material.Another reason why players quitted was the lack of new resources, and the amount of care the developers gave to the game, which was close to nothing. Sure, there were some tournaments in place, but these were won by the same people most of the time, since it is a hard to learn game.Today, the lobbies for a match to take place take a long time to start, because of the lack of players. The game is outdated, and tournaments no longer take place. Many people take advantage of the new players and kill them for the additional points which affect their ranks. This game is in the edge of complete extinction or in its way to the renovation of the game, bringing more and more players. This all depends on what the developers decide to do.I would recommend playing it, since it is very fun and addictive if you get the hang of it. Remmember, watch youtube videos and guides on how to get better, or you will be one of the thousands that quit for the learning curve. Most of us are hoping for an update in January, but this is up to the developers."

From what I’ve heard this game was once F2P, and I think it should’ve stayed that way. The devs have dropped support on this game for a while now, which I suppose is why it isn’t playable to the public without purchasing ARK.

Yes, it does take a good while to get used to how to play, especially if you are new to ARK like I am. But this game is a great way to learn the basics. Once you know how to play and craft, the game will get a lot more in depth, especially with friends!Don't give up just because you lost.

,Not Recommended,407530,25474585,"Posted: 11 September, 2016",all,Loki Jembiebs,"After playing this game and take it from me someone who has more than 2 hours on record as I can see from the reviews I have come to a conclusion, this is a difficult and not well balanced game. First I'll start out with the pros, for starters this is a free game and its one that I will admit got me in it's grip and it was good when you don't get screwd over and it could have been a fun game. It also has a good ranking system and cool prizes which could include up to $4,000 if you are ""good"" at this game. This game is also very addictive and can keep you in it's grip if you are considered ""lucky"" and if you figured out this game well enough. Now the cons, this game has the wrong title it should be considered being called ARK SURVIVAL OF THE LUCKIEST. I say this because there are no ways you can actually have a game plan, the spawn locations in this game is random so one person can have a rex/spino in front of them and the other could have a whole bunch of raptors and scorpions to screw with them. Ok well say you don't wanna tame and you would like to tech, well if you get lucky enough not to be ambushed by a person with a few tames or someone with a rex/spino then you have to fight the high lvl tames that you will most likely lose to due to the fact that chitin armor isn't enough to repel a bite or attack from tames. So the tame is not well balanced with the techers in this game. Now the most annoying thing in the world STUPID FKN TEAMERS!! They team together against you and then they now have guns and tames(so your pretty much screwd) and that 35 min, 45 min, or hour long game is wasted due to stupid annoying cheaters. Another con is the bad optimization I have a friend that has a Titan and an i7 6700k and gets realy bad frequent frame drops. I have a GTX 1080 Founders Edition card and an i7 6700k and I stay at a good 80+ fps rate on epic settings. Now he plays on lower settings than I do and considering that a Titan is a good card( not the newest titan btw) and is fairly new can't get good frame rates proves that this game like ARK SURVIVAL EVOLVED is poorly optimized. Now I could go on and on about this but I hope to have helped you make a good decision, now you can always try this game out consiering this is a free game but if you don't wanna waste your time and effort then I personally don't recommed this game."
,Recommended,407530,29926782,Posted: 14 February,all,LazerEdge67,Great and fun game to play if you just want to play some pvp in ark without having to join a server and wait to level up your character.
,Recommended,407530,32429251,Posted: 15 June,all,Mgsgta3,"It is and was a beautiful game, one full of wonderful highs and devestatingly utter♥♥♥♥♥♥times. It's got a brutal learning curve but if you hang in there its pretty fun. Its based off of ark but isnt much like ark as all the things from that game are tweaked and a bit different.Pros: Great way to do some battle royale-Its free(if you own ark, which if you dont own ark you should leave this review right now and buy it.)-Lobby ca be a decent wy to make allies, friends.Cons: Lobby can be a decent way to make you want to shoot yourself, like when a 12 year old just starts screaming ""NOISE! IM MAKING  NOISE!"" in the lobby for 30 seconds.-in a match of 1 vs 24 others you wont win every time. can be discouraging if you have weak resolve.-Not going to lie, games got some development issues. Aside from being on hiatus and not being developed until after ark releases in august, it has some bugs. getting stuck on a tree, dinos pathfinding is poop. Cant tell you how many times I marched toward the final  battle with 2-3 rexs in tow and get to the ramp and only have 1.Overall Id say this is a must own, as it is free when you buy ark, which is a must own. I rather like that its not under development because the game is like one of those log houses museums keep perfectly preserved from like 1790 in the sense that its frozen at a beautiful time in arks development that is well in the past now,  so now it gives that nostalgia every time i begin a round."

I think a final battle between only last players and their tamed dinosaurs is more fun than this.-- Evolution events are overpowered. you can easily die by a stupid monkey! (while monkeys isn't so dangerous creatures in the main ark game) most times survive from this events is just luck , rather than skill.If you have performance issues , just launch the game in shader model 4 low memory mode and decrease graphic options. you can play it with good fps (but horrible graphic!)"

I've been playing this game for some weeks now, with 180 hours approx. on a Mac OS X El Capitan 3,2 GHz Intel Core i5, 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 675MX 1024 MB.This one runs just fine on low settings ( still looking really good) and the main problem is about lag and sync. Sometimes I feel like I have what I like to call "" Lag Radar"". When someone is around me or I look in the direction of some player it starts dropping FPS so I know I have to run the other way until we're 5 left, but that's fun because is what this game is all about, right? Being the Fittest with what you have. In PvP I experienced some really bad moments, like the bow just going useless in the sense that it doesn't even drag the arrow back to fire, and sometimes in PvE. But anyway the game itself it's just great. The idea, the development and the "" Free to Play"" thing, for what I'm thankful.I guess some improvements can be made for the lag problem, maybe the crafting system could be the cause or simply my bad peruvian average internet connection.Talking about the game mechanics, I think the whole Tame following system should be improved because I lost hundreds of good dinos in the forest and had pretty nice armies decimated by rocks and trees, specially in my first matches. I still remember a match in which I had this Sarco stuck on a rock that was 2 meters away and blocked my other tames while I was pushed by the Ring of Death and I had to just leave them all. Since I started it improved, but I'm totally sure you can do even better. Another thing that I think would be appreciated by the most is a hit feedback on the HUD when you actually hit a player. Sometimes you feel like you're hitting somebody with your arrows or spears and run for a final charge just to realize you actually didn't and you're running to death.In the end, this is one of the best competitive games I've ever played, I have a lot of fun playing it and I absolutely recommend it for any player! It takes time and practice and specially to be focused on what you're doing.Great job.Rezerk"

I live out of my car now because the computer used up all the money that a new house would have cost. But now I get 10,000 fps and the game looks unreal! I don't even care that I'm now without a home. My car has plenty of space inside anyway and this is probably the greatest game that has ever existed. IGN 10/10 would burn down hose again."

I run this on a gtx 660 and it runs fine on medium settings, both real ark and this. Too be fair though, there are parts of the map which cause fps drops, but usually bounces back up soon after.2.Don't be bad3.There are guides for a reason. Besides, just play. Like any fps it takes time to get good4.Play an updated version of the game. It's in early access, and there are updates constantly. Each time it fixes things and adds new things or mechanics to the game. The game has changed a lot.Like all games, you aren't good when you first start, unless of course, you are just a natural. However, most people are not a natural, so it takes time to become decent and know what to do. I'm still learning how to play this game, as I am constantly finding new strats and things to help me.

For instance, the game gives players a wide variety of strategies to utilize, from crafting high-end weapons to taming dinosaurs. Unfortunately, with the immense size of the arena, encountering players before the final 5-10 minutes is unlikely, unless you know the popular spots on the map. Taming dinos seems to be the best strategy right now, since teching leaves a lot to be desired in terms of equipment. At best, unless a Fabricator is made, you can have a basic shotgun, a basic pistol, and a basic rifle. The equipment degradation on these weapons is perhaps a bit too fast, as it almost forces techers to construct back-up weapons. Crafting ammo also consumes a copious amount of resources, and you can only progress as fast as your forges smelt iron.Overall, in its current state, I'm iffy on recommending it, but it is free-to-play, so there's nothing to lose should you be interested in a Battle Royale game with dinosaurs."

Its easy to tame spinos and rexes, but if you have more than one they get stuck in each other, and they're way too easy to kill. I dont think 5 shots with a shotgun would kill a rex in real life... And the community is horrible, I get targetted alot for taming something someone else wanted to tame. I've tried teching but I usually die to raptors, or swarms of meganeura. Theres no time to do anything in FFA, the wall closes in too quick. I can hardly get a shotgun with 10 bullets and a pistol with 30 before the walls killing me and Im just barely keeping alive. Theres alot to fix."
,Recommended,407530,22728895,"Posted: 30 April, 2016",all,SWIGGITY SENPAI,"One of the best and most addicting games I’ve ever played thus far. What ARK: SOTF is to me is a fun and innovative survival game that takes the pvp element to new heights. What makes this game so great is what I call the perfect pvp trifecta: Players, AI, and Environment. Those 3 things combined make or break your experience, they each can help or hinder your gameplay and that to me is what a pvp game should be. What most cool is that you can really step aside form pvp and play the game and survive al in one go.There are many pros to this game and as with a game especially an early access there are always some cons.Right out the gate I must say my first play through convinced me this game is nearly perfect as is. It was really solid and felt as if it could be ready for its final debut with only a couple of updates. But the more I played I came to the conclusion that some things could be a lot better. Keep in mind this is my opinion and may not be so technical exact or straightforward in regards to the game, but more a wish list of sorts.Steam does not allow such a long reveiw, so for my full reveiw/wishlist for the game i would highly recommend you check this out!https://creators.co/@TheBlueMarauder/3893350It is very insightful and well written and i hope the developers of the game will also read it.

To be honest, I don't know which one is better. Do HEADSHOTS! If you want to take someone out you want to aim for the head.TamingTame a Trike First up and maybe 3 Dilos. I highly suggest Taming Early, or within the 2x Taming Event. You can use a Trike to Kill or get Resources. You can use some dilos to store your items on but be Wary that your Dilos could die and you can lose all the stuff you stored on it!EventsGet fur armor for the MEGACold Event and get Hide armor or have No armor for the MEGAHeat event. the Fog Event, That is the best time to check your inventory alot and gather Berries and create a small shack quickly and then Demolish it.For Acid Rain, SEEK SHELTER IMMEDIATELY! I think a Cave or under some rocks or a tree would protect you but you can always get hit out of under that rock, cave or tree and then start burning up in flames and shredding slowly and painfully i mean what? Enough about events time for my opinion on the Game.My Opinion on SOTFI think SOTF is a Great game because its basically the Hunger games except with Dinosaurs and you can gather more items and not get sponsored because its for the best of the best, I'm sorry its actually for anyone so ye can actually start off new in it and get pretty good in the game, SOTF is an Insane Game all about Surviving and Trust.Be careful who you Trust.May the Odds be ever in your Favor."

Gtx960 overclocked; Intel core I5-4460(or sth like that); 12gb of ram; high-ish settings. The game runs at about 20-ish FPS...2nd: I have a monitor with a resolution of 1600x1200 and the HUD is broken. Some buttons don't appear, some things go over the edge of the background.3rd: Confuseing HUD layout. So I spent the first 5 minutes of a match trying to figure out how to lear engrams (the skill tree). Turns out, that It actually automatically gives all the blueprints to you and you CAN'T learn engrams. Btw there is still an engram button, like in ARK:Survival Evolved only it has NO USE.In conclusion: The game is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ multiplayer copy of ARK:Survival Evolved. Don't even bother with downloading this pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥until it is finally optimised.But hey at least I don't have to make it look like a NES game to play it. :)Old review:So I WAS going to play this again to see if it had been updated and had actually been patched to run better than a NES game, but there are no servers... this game is pretty much dead.Last time I played it was at least a year ago.

While they are easy to kill with going backwards tecnic, theres just so many ''annoy factors'' that you spend more time on managing all this things than rather PvP.  The game is very 2 stressful and not so much building up in some sort of wayTake H1z1, you fall down you start loot and equipt up,Rust , you start naked find crates and slowly pick up pieces here and there until you sort of got some gear that you can fight with.In Ark surival of the fittest you just randomly wonder around hoping not to get RNG'ed by whatever the jungle do to you. I havent had any real pvp session because i had to manage way 2 many things.Last but not least, the while inventory managment is so clumsy in a fast phased arena game.I gave it a year but its really clumsy unbalanced and not enjoyable... only ppl who hardcore grind this game to have every single knowledged unlocked on the spine will somehow enjoy it. But any sort of casual players or medium players will run from this game.The game needs a huge overhaul - More info on events , make inventory and crafting more simple and easy to acess, remove the ants and mosquitos , allow your self to not strugglle with the thing you put statpoints in."

And official servers are either just high in ping or boring while unofficial servers are kinda risky as the hosts might decide to screw with you or close it down anytime. For a world building survival  and team work game it lacks the most important aspect of multiplayer...

People with less powerful computers WILL have troubles running it, and it is quite complex. However, the pros are great in number. What you get on your purchase of zero dollars and zero cents (Pro #1) is a intricate game of skill, with just the right amount of luck involved (Pro #2). After jumping over the initial wall of terminology, you will discover a world of possibilities: countless strategies (Pro #3), a large map to memorize (Pro #4), the option of team games (although I only ever play FFA). As someone who plays DotA, a game that is most definitely not fun, and people only play for a competitive surrounding and the opportunity to yell at other like minded people, this is really quite the game for me, and for MANY others."

It runs fine for me, and I'm using a 7 year old desktop from staples with only an upgraded graphics card and power supply. Here's the biggest problem- the learning curve. Unless you already play ARK: Survival Evolved, don't bother with this game at all. There is no way- or time (once you die you have to find a new server and repeat the exact same things)- to learn anything without looking it up, and even then you'll find your results fruitless. It isn't challenging mechanically, but it makes it nearly impossible to manage yourself. Half of my games so far have ended with death to the Swarm (a generated event of ~15 level 9 flying bugs that will chase you to no end) before I could even open my inventory to see what I grabbed from the middle. All I had time to gather were rocks and berries. If you want to get away from them, you have to run to the river, as they cannot get you in the water, where you will either freeze or be eaten by pirannhas. As I post this I have 2.1 hours but have been in plenty of games- my longest life being around 10 minutes.In conclusion (TL;DR): This game might as well have stayed a mod, since you need the original game to play it properly anyway."

,Recommended,407530,25427170,"Posted: 9 September, 2016",all,DrSadistic,"Ark: Survival Evolve is an amazing concept that thus far, has been executed very well. The devs have been responsive, new content is deliver often, a new DLC has even been released. In my opinion, Ark is amazing. That being said... Survival of the Fittest is NOT Ark.SOTF strips away everything that I love about Ark. The semi-relaxed gameplay allowing one to play at their own pace, the discovery of new species of dinos, the optional PVP element and the amazing graphics are what made me fall in love with Ark. SOFT keeps the graphics, although you wont be able to appreciate them because without a very high end PC, you have to run this game in Medium to Low graphics to be competitive, but loses the causal aspect of the game. Its stripped of a plethora of the species of dinos in the main game, and what we are left with is an overly competitive shell of what Ark used to be.That being said, I do like this game for what it is. It is a fast paced, crafting FPS focused entire on PVP. Building as quickly as you can to prepare for the ever increasing moment where you'll be in a fight for your life, which will happen within a 30 minute period. You or you and some friends will be pitted against other ""survivors"" in a Hunger Games style arena and only the Fittest will Survive.The Doctor's Final Report: 7/10; If you love Ark, give this a try. If you love Hunger Game style games, give this a try. If you love survival crafting games... leave it alone."

Now I'm here playing a simular game on a PC, and there's no tutorial to help new players like me.Fist of all, the FPS is movie-quallity for me, runing at around 30 FPS, AND DON'T GIVE THIS GAME A NEGATIVE REVIEW ABOUT FPS, IT'S YOUR COMPUTER'S BUILD.

Another game where we wait FOREVER just to play the game!I have only escaped the lobby and ACTUALLY played the game 2 TIMES, then died right after I got into the game. But during a [u[1-hour session in the LOBBY OF VOID[/u], I'm finding myself with 7 naked men,all of them chose weird body builds (Like big heads and tiny bodies, migets with mucles, EVEN HUGE PEOPLE!), RUNING AROUND, PUNCHING PEOPLE AND DANCING, and talking about ""When will the game even start?!""The other problem about the lobbies of void is that I don't want to have to join a session with OVER 20 PEOPLE.Now, here's the problem about THE PLAYERS: After everyoneFINALLY BEAMS DOWN ONTO ACTUAL LAND, everyone goes up to the loot and starts chasing other players and killing them. This makes some people get no loot and instantly lose the game. I need the loot, but everytime I try to get some loot, some jerk has to kill me. Not fair, not cool. Nope, not dealing with this. So I just turn away from the loot and ANOTHER PLAYER runs up to me and kills me.Plus, too many players make a session too long and too hard for new players.0/10 Would ratherBUYARK: SE instead of playing this game fetched from the landfils in [insert country name here]"

I tried to watch some guides to understand how to play and indeed i began to get it but there is so much going on and things that i have to look at and its just too much for me like enough i am wasting time i can barely do anything i cant just go around and explore since the game at some point will start to show where is every survived player is and if you are not in a tribe like most players you will get killed SO fast like no chance.Overall :Good gameBuggyNo tutorialsconfusingPersonal opinion : I feel like the Devs are just too passionate and it was overwhelming for them and couldnt keep up.I would suggest to focus on one game at a time then move to the other since ARK SOTF kinda gave me an impression on ARK SE and a reason to not buy the game even tho i wanted it."

I can't even allow my kids to watch the matches because of all the verbal trolling and disgusting terms used. Perhaps a ban on names that shouldn't be used would be a good start, add into that Lobby Mods who have the power to Kick people from that match, that Would be a Great Start! My next and last complaint is about balancing. Dinos start out with way too low a Stamina stat, EG: a Pteranodon that  i waste time tameing and when i ride it I can only fly 100 feet [10 m]... so if its can't be used in the match, why have it as an option,  I was under the impression that all tactics could be valid if done right...well. its not entirely true is it?...So in summery, it has been and could be fun, but some parts/players seem to want to watch the map [mode] burn rather than be sportsmanlike or even just plain polite. I give it a 8 for potential and a 4 for implementation."

Every server is different with its own unique tribes of players fighting wars for control of the server.If you like roleplay this game could be fun as well because you can be a pirate, or tradesmen, animal / dino breeder or merchant, maybe even pretend to be the police and save the day when bad guys attack random noobs."

The 25 FFA formula is very exciting.It is tough to get into though. Take some time to look up a couple of tutorials and don't expect to win your first 10 matches. There is a real gem here but you need to get into it.My biggest critique would be that it could use more regular updates to keep the game fresh. It also needs more polish.A lot of people critique Wildcard for making this instead of finishing the main game but for someone like me with a decent PC the base game already works fine. I have as much time into this game as I do in the base game if not more. I personally applaud Wildcard, I have not been entertained for so long with a game since WoW and I only payed 30$ for it."

,Not Recommended,407530,26709211,"Posted: 20 November, 2016",all,nexigen ツ,"This is definitely not what I was expecting.  As far as I've seen, there are no dragons like those in the pictures.  Each game lasts about 30 minutes, I think, and is extremely fast-paced.  You do not pick your engrams, you start with all of them.  Saddles are also not required, all tames are automatically equipped.  The crafting is also different, for example you don't need spoiled meat to make narcotics anymore.  Gathering and xp is also, as expected, insainely buffed.  You'll constantly hear the levelup noise and a few seconds of gathering on plants will give you a ton of fiber to deal with.  Most people seem to end up with a rex and couple mammoths when the end-game comes along, at which time it slowly closes, forcing players into the center.I wanted to see more normalized gameplay, where you have to strategize to actually get kills and survive.  This has no real strategies, just a couple template builds you can find online.  The map is very limited in size so there's nowhere to really hide, plus the many 'drops' that occur will always spawn way above each player.  So if there's a mammoth drop (yea, seriously, 4 mammoths fall from the sky for no apparent reason lol), you'll easily see where everyone is.  It's too redundant for me and after a few games I found it quite boring.Now if it were up to me, I'd make this thing the full map size, a few hours duration, and taming/xp/gathering to be set alot closer to normal, maybe 3x."

People start in the middle (either solo, teams of 2, or teams of 4) and have a limited amount of time (30-45 minutes depending on version) to survive. The winner is the final player/team standing. It takes the same game-play and elements of Ark, but in an accelerated version.

I wish the team behind this would put commit more time to optimazation, adding more content, I say that because it gets old just either taming or working towards a weapon and armor. Its a great game mode but they should do something to work around the low pop currently. You only really get in quick during peak hours.
