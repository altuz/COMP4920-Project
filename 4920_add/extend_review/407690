The little mini-map that shows the base runners showed no base runners. It wasn't my noobness. Considering other bugs, I know it wasn't me.After the very first game, my starting pitcher won the game! Woot. Then he won it again! Wait huh? After the one and only game, my first starting pitcher had a record of 2-0. That's Cy young material there!This is one of those games you wish you had a ""Meh"" button mashed between the ""Yes I recommend it"" and ""No I dont"" buttons.It's a fun little arcady type game. If you are looking for a serious and detailed baseball simulation, look elsewhere. If you want to blow 10 minutes every now and then in a brain dead way, then yeah.... I recommend it despite its faults. The graphics aren't quite Major League quality (more like double A) but its merely adequate. The sound? Well... my recomendation is to play this while watching a real baseball game and crank up the TV's volume.In the end, Im giving it a thumbs up because I will probably keep playing it for whatever brain dead reason of mine."

I was a bit let down by the fact that the game developers didn't make a carrer mode or a Francise mode this year. And the fact that they don't allow trades during the season and there's no custom create a player mode or sliders. I just didn' like it!!!

Has all the nostalgic nods to the old days and brings it to today. It feels and plays just like I remember it. Was able to just jump right in and get at it. Of course, there are quite a few improvements over the NES version of yester years with authentic MLB rosters and stats along with pretty good renders of the actual stadiums (that I have seen so far). Takes a bit of time to get use to the speed of the pitching and controlling your fielders, but I know this will be one I will enjoy as the season goes on.Those of you looking for an experience like MLB The Show, keep moving. This is by no means a complete MLB simulation game. Graphics are smooth and purdy, but I care more for gameplay than I do how good it looks.This was my first time playing any of the new RBI Baseball games that started in 2014, and I am happy with my purchase. Cant wait to get more in tune with the controlls and timing so that I may get my taste of online ranked matches.In short, if you loved the original RBI Baseball on the NES, this will not dissapoint. PLAY BALL!!!! GO ASTROS!!!!"

Pitch, swing, miss. Over and over.Someimes the AI will make contact, but as I say, its very rare. Thats what I found anyways and its spoiling the game, so going to have to give it a thumbs down until this is corrected.Not tried online yet, which should be better in this regard, but dont really like playing baseball online as not found many people that try to play it properly and dont just swing at everything."

It plays very much the same if not exactly the same. Automatic dives and jumps have been added this year, which is a good thing. I was really hoping for the ability to make trades during season mode. Currently that isn't an option. I was also hoping for injuries or fatigue for the fielders. Sadly both are lacking again this year. All the fields are there as well as the players. I enjoyed last year's game and I enjoy this one. Can I recommend it? Yes, if you're looking for a baseball game on the PC platform. No, if you're looking for an all out in-depth baseball sim.

The main reason why I gave this game a positive review is I solved all the problems later while playing this game. A good thing is that this game that I haven't mentioned is that hasn't crashed once which is the reason why I refunded RBI baseball 15. With the controls I started using my steam controller and the controls are MUCH EASIER to use when playing this game. With fly balls or fielding I went to the settings and clicked ""assisted"" on fielding and now I can actually get outs on Flyballs and popups and this game is now actually real fun. If you get this game I would stay under the 2 hour limit and refund it if you have other problems with it that I didn't have or used to have. Finally, if you have a Steam controller or a Xbox controller and you have this game I recommend you use it since the controls are much easier."

,Recommended,407690,23994413,"Posted: 1 July, 2016",all,Cleveland Rock,"This game keeps it simple and doesn't waste your time. When a batter strikes out, it gets right to the next one without making you watch him walk up to the plate. When a play is finished, there are no slow motion replays or commentary to slow down the action. You can wrap up a nine-inning game in no time and move right on to the next one, which makes playing an entire season seem like an actual possibility.It sticks to the basics. There's a roaring crowd, cheerful organ music, and umpires to tell you who's safe and who's out. Despite its simplicity, it also features all the real-life teams, players, and stadiums, keeping you updated with all the latest roster updates.The controls are nice and simple. They remind me of the old days of playing on the SNES as a kid. The pitching and batting are two-dimensional, so the ball never goes above or below the strike zone. The options let you manually control the fielders or give you AI assistance. You can also specify your favorite team, so you can spend less time in the menus and more time playing ball.It's a simple baseball game the way it should be. Just like Mom used to make (if your mom used to make video games)."

This game is meant to be played with a controller and it feels really good as far as the controls. I was playing the original RBI baseball on my emulator last night having fun and while online afterwards I noticed that this game was out and I didn't even know it and let me say it feels great and looks great and all these scrubs giving it negative reviews obviously don't have a decent xbox controller and/or they have no idea how to play this game even though it is pretty self explanitory.

The season mode should take you right into the postseason if you have a good enough record, the postseason mode should have the ability to customize the playoff brackets, there's no customizable controls, and has some bad bugs. For instance, if you ever check your swing and end up hitting the ball, it doesn't matter if it's an easy ground ball out or a bloop single intto shallow center, the runner will stay at the plate. It's programmed very lazily, however the game is still very fun and replayable. I definitely recommend it to any baseball fan looking for a pick-up and play experince, but absolutely not a the asking price of $20. It is honestly insulting that this game ever costed (and still costs) $20, considering that it's not finished. However, if you happen to find this game on sale for under $10, I would say pick it up for yourself, but be mildly cautious about the whole experience in general."

Not The Show or the 2K series, not OOTP, but an arcadey version of baseball to scratch the itch without putting in too much effort. I didn't want perfection, the occasional bug would've been fine.For the most part I got what I was expecting, but I quickly found a game ruining bug where both myself and the AI could hit NOTHING but foul balls. Hitting a ball in play was no longer possible. We would both smack foul ball after foul ball until a walk or a missed swing for a strikeout (which was rare). Every at-bat turned into a 20+ pitch at-bat. It didn't matter that my pitcher was exhausted (200+ pitches), the AI was just going to hit fouls no matter what. I restarted the game, it went okay for several innings until the bug reappeared. Unfortunately I didn't realize that the refund policy was for less than 2 hours played. I own over 70 games on Steam, never regretted a purchase, never asked for a refund. This game broke that streak for me.I am very disappointed that the MLB would endorse and advertise for this game.

I constantly find my baserunners running themselves into double plays, my fielders dropping simple pop-ups, and my fielders sometimes not even pursuing the ball at all.There's no trading or player creation either. Rosters were last updated at the non-waiver trade deadline, so at least they're current. And can we talk about how this game looks like it belongs on the goddamn Dreamcast?

Retro gaming with modern graphics, current rosters, and beautiful models of actual stadiums to play in.In execution it falls very flat. You can't dive, jump, or turn double plays even with the ball hit directly to your middle infielders. Good luck going around the horn...It's also frustrating to field fly balls. The interface for showing how far away the ball is tends to be misleading, and lining your fielder up with the ring rarely results in a catch. You need to be a little before or after the ring and they'll make an awkward stab at it to rein it in.Batting is ridiculous, as the CPU manages to make pitches fade right under your bat, while you can't replicate the same effect. It's either a 94 MPH fastball, or a 72 MPH ""wobbler"" that the CPU never offers at.I can't recommend this even at $6.50."

""Medium"" plays more like a super difficult level simply because hitting the ball is like actually trying to hit a major league pitch coming at you at 100 mph.The ""easy"" level is way too easy, especially when you can consistently score 15 plus runs every game with 25 hits and up.Just an fyi"

If it's going to be ""RBI Baseball"" and appealing to nostalgia, why don't they just make it look like RBI baseball, like the original game did? Namco did exactly that about 10 years ago in their Japanese game and it was awesome. Instead, we have a typical modern baseball video game that puts graphics above gameplay.If you're feeling nostalgic, just dust off your old NES/Famicom, because this will not do the trick at all."

For example, the sound effects often turn off, even when I make sure the volume is normal. And don't even bother with online play unless you invite a friend, the computer will freeze. (Here's a command to close frozen apps: MAC-command, alt, esc/ PC-control, alt, delete.) But despite that, I found this to be a great game. You can choose your team's unfiforms, where they play, and change your roster. (You can't add players from different teams to your roster, and I really wished they had that function!) I recommend changing the controls to MODERN in the settings, and make sure the resolution is the same that your computer has for easier play. OK, so this was more of a bunch of how-to tips instead of a review... As for getting the game, I'd stick with MLB The Show if you have a Playstation. But if you don't have a Playstation and really like baseball, this game is perfect for you!"

There are a small amount of miss calls on base runners not bing call out but that does happen in real lfe.

It's difficult to tell if it's a ball or strike half the time. Your defense is lousy. There will be plays where clearly it's the second baseman's ball and it assigns you an outfielder playing deep. You're infielders half-heartedly jump for balls and rarely dive. They also move as if running through molasses. No hustle. Bench them all. And holy cow are there a lot of foul balls. If there were this many in real life, no one would go home without one."

Nothing spectacular but great in it's simplicity. In sports, you cannot control all variables. This game is no different. Even if you get good at, lets say hitting, it's still an entertaining challenge to make contact no matter how much you may be able to run up the score. Each at bat is challenging as when I played real baseball."

This games was awful. It is especially awful when you are batting because the camera angle is dumb and hard to tell what pitch is being thrown and where. And you cant change it so its very hard to hit. Plus once i plugged in a controller the game wouldnt work. Not worth the money, dont buy this game!"
