I espescially like the plans & flowers and the animals even if they (the animals) are rarely seen. But just watching a bird high in the sky fly over you makes the enviorment feel so real. the clouds and the lightning are vere well made so that the shift from day to night is really great.But like already mentioned from other guys the are some cons:- its quite short, in 15-20 mins you seen everything- the thin lines from the leaves etc. look blury in vr (at distance)- the paddle with vive is much to slow and to anoying. it would be very helpfull if with one ""strike"" you will float like 10 meters so you don't have to paddle all the timeAll in all a very nice and relaxing experiance."

Ran smooth as butter on epic settings with my i7 4790k and gtx 980ti and looked really nice to boot!The water oh man so serene and relaxing. I really wanted to put my hand in the water and at one point i extended my hands outward in an attempt to do so lol.Totally recommend to anyone who enjoys a vr experience that has to do with nature. Only gripe was that it's too short! But Im hoping they will add more seeing how it's early access. Worth 10 dollars as is imo.

,Not Recommended,407710,24646114,"Posted: 31 July, 2016",all,arleas,"So I've used this thing for a while.  It's not a game, it's an ""experience"" because that's something you can do in VR... experience things.  I really want to give these guys a thumbs up but I can't... Why not?  I've never been to the Grand Canyon so I can't say for sure whether or not it's authentic... What ICANsay isn't authentic is that the resolution is crap and it detracts from the experience when you look at the scenery and see this jagged pixellated crap.    Apparently there's a tweak you can do that might wind up adding some much needed smoothing to those pixellated edges, but it requires a really beefy card to leave it turned on for everything.So the aliasing is a big problem for stuff in the distance, but it's also got some problems with walls being way too ""flat"" with sharp corners up close.  Am I going through the Grand Canyon or is this the lego recreation of the Grand Canyon?Things I liked:You get to experience what it might be like to paddle down the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon.You get a flashlight, paddles, and a way to teleport yourself in cases where moving would take you out of the room scale play areapaddling the little canoe thing doesn't make you sick but still gives that sensation you're movingif you lean left and right over the seated area you will see the sides of the ""canoe"" thing dip into the water as it reacts to the shifting weight.Things I didn't like:Crappy resolutionCrappy water textures (They're working on it I guess?)I'm not even sure what I'm supposed to do other than paddle aroundThere's no map or anything so you're not even sure how far you can goNightfall comes pretty quickly so without the flashlight it gets pretty hard to see, and what there is to see isn't that interesting.You can use two paddles (each controller being a paddle) but there really isn't a good way to make it feel like you're actually rowing.  I wound up most of the time using one controller as a paddle and the other as a flashlight/teleport thing most of the time.Really though most of what irked me about this game wasn't the graphics.  I wanted to like it.  It's a cool idea...I just feel like they need more direction.  Which way should I paddle?  How far can I go?  Is there supposed to be something to see at night?  Maybe they could add some narration from someone famous (or not famous) about the local wildlife or rock formations, or history of the area or something.Instead I feel like it's just ""paddle around, maybe see some stuff....maybe see something to make you feel like it was worth the trip but probably not"".  Like maybe if they had an Indian Village to visit, or showed some especially iconic and beautiful scenery... the way I felt, it could have just been ""generic river through generic canyon with generic plants"".  Google ""grand canyon river"" and look at the pictures and compare that to what you see in game... it's not even close.The most interesting thing I saw was an empty Canoe going by on its own... I decided I'd paddle up to it and try to get into it and maybe see if there were some clues to the owner, but nope...there was no way to stop it from going off on its own (was it motorized?) and I couldn't get into it... It was a nicer ""canoe"" than the one I started with since the one I started with looked more like a surfboard than a boat...Maybe there was something there... like the beginning of a mystery that I had to figure out, but the problem is, they didn't give me any tools to stop the boat, examine it closer or anything.... I feel like the whole thing was wasted opportunity.EDIT:  So I figured out what I was missing... When you first start out and walk to the pier, there's a picture of a canoe with ""360°"" and an arrow around it, and under that is a yellow cube.  Touch the yellow cube with your controller and you're teleported to that canoe on it's pre-programmed circuit of the area.The problem is, if you try to do ANYTHING with your controllers, you're zapped back to the pier again.   If you wait long enough the canoe will go right past the pier and you can follow on the other ""surfboard"" boat, and maybe get in front of it and let the canoe push you along.It would have been nice if you could speed the boat up, but nothing I did seemed to affect it without zapping me back to the pier again.Buy it cheap if you must, but don't expect to be amazed by the experience.  Any time you come close to feeling in awe of something, the jagged graphics will remind you that you're in VR.  It's a shame really."
76561198303974326,Recommended,407710,29683046,Posted: 3 February,all,Mad_Carew,"I have played this ""Game/App"" through multiple revisions and am extremely impressed with how it has evolved and improved. Both the Day and Night experiences in the Kayak are excellent and each quite different. The range of living creatures now experienced is quite large. I have seen a Deer, a Hare (Jackrabbit), two large Lizards (Gila Monsters?), many different Birds, many Bats in the tunnel to the Waterfall, many Fish and many Frogs. Also there are Fireflies, Butterflies and other assortd Insects. I hear Coyotes at night; wish I could see them! The Fish can be fed with pellets from the Can on the floor.In addition, the Rendering of the Rocks is superb, especially close up with Flashlight illumination, and the clear Water with ripples is impressive. Little touches such as noise and vibration when the Kayak rides over rocks or branches in the water adds greatly to the realism. Flowers, plants, trees are all impressive, especially when they sway realistically in the wind.This work is exactly why I enjoy VR and it is impressive how the product has evolved. I would like to draw attention to a few, albiet minor, flaws or possible improvements that are noted to help the Developers:1. At night the Moon changes from a half Disc to a quarter Crescent to a very thin Crescent, all in a single run. This cannot be in the real world; this evolution follows a 28 day cycle and should be fixed during the experience. It would be clever if it were to be Full or different Crescents on successive trips but this might be a hardship for the rendering of the illumination of the rocks.2. I fed a Fish and it then swam right through the Kayak as if it were full of water and not an obstruction.3. I wish the Frogs would swim a bit longer and not just blink out of existance.4. I can find the Gila Monsters at night but wish that there were Eyes reflecting the Light, not necessarily with a visible Animal.5. The Flashlight is very good but there is a somewhat unrealistic distance cut-off of the illumination. This conflicts with the real life experience. Also it would be nice if, when selected ON, it were to stay ON without holding the Trigger, perhaps toggle ON/OFF with successive Trigger pulls. Also I found a mode where it is a Head-Mounted light but this (I think) requires the PC Keyboard Control Key to be pressed. The Motor's Speed Control does not require to be held; if released it stays at the chosen setting; the Flashlight should do the same.6. I have commented before that the Waterfall, although very good, does not interact with the Lake water, which would in real life be very turbulent.This is one of the two Apps (The Blu is the other) that I use to introduce new Viewers to VR and I am hoping that further evolution can be anticipated. Very good work everyone!"

If I was to introduce somebody to the rift, this isn't one of the selections I'd pick to show.Mostly you are a floating body on a kayak ride in a loop. Not much to do, the scenery is OK.. but that is about it. A lot gets lost as the try to use high details which don't translate well and make the experience feel dated in graphics.Suspect this is just an early prototype before they make it a kayak fishing game. Then I could see it being pretty good with the HTC. (holding paddles, fishing rod, etc.)But as now.. it is a 5/10 sorta meh. Pick it up if you want to support the developers and throw some money early on at the VR world."

For $9.99 I expect a measure of artistry, and that artistry just isnt here.  this basically feels less like the great outdoors than it does one of those rides at a cheap amusement park.  ohhhh look, theres some sort of styrofoam cactus.  huh, theres an animatronic lizard.  oh there is a bird projected on the ceiling (which i cant move my head to look at or the game jitters).pros:if i put the game on absolute highest quality and dont ever move my head, there is a measure of immersion.i appreciate the effort to put wild animals in the gamethe ambient sounds are lovelycons:guys seriously $9.99?  its one scene and it lasts less time than it took for me to download it.gtx 1060 card, when i move my head in the game the jitter is very, very bad.  moving my head in TheBlu however has no jitter.  perhaps a better card might not have this problem but its not like this has a lot of moving pieces to render.the trout are a nice touch but the decision to layer a second 'shimmering' image over them only made me honestly think 'oh ok, so the trout are all paired up with mates or something..?' until i realized this was an attempt to emulate water refraction.  it doesnt land, that effect.why are there massive iguanas here?  no such animal in the grand canyon.  if you want gila monsters, open up blender and alter your iguana assets to make gila monsters.  or go ba77s deep and throw in some dinosaurs and krakens.  but commit, either way.  you shouldnt be phoning it in with vanilla Unity store assets in a $9.99 game.'artificial intelligence' in the animals?  stop.  just knock it off.  frogs jumping off lily pads when youre X feet away doth not AI make.the quality of the visuals on the absolute highest level is only slightly better than what i 'experience' in a vintage Road Runner vs Wil-e Coyote cartoon.and again im sorry if this feels nit picky but a) its really not and b) when youre charging $9.99 for an experience game, you need to come correct."

Water and water spashes need improvment but think i saw they are fixing that. The only other issue for me is the board is a bit too responsive when i paddle it makes the scene move too quickly and jerky, makes me feel a little funny prob not going to stop me exploring yet.

I just wish steam offered a VR Experiences category, that way those people that only want games would stop being disappointed.Firstly, lets address a few of the complains people seem to have firstly price, play time: I have now had 2 full play throughs sessions of this game trying both day and night modes taking my time and stopping from time to time to soak up the experience and I have clocked up 1.5 Hours of play time for £6.99 so from my point of view the price seems fair as its about the same price as downloading a movie.  But I also except if you rush round and only play this ones or miss the night or day modes and just play one time off day going at full boat speed you can finish this much quicker, but I think you would be missing the point.Secondly, I would say the graphics are quite good for a VR game, but live all games and experiences the resolution is limited by the current generation of high end graphics cards and VR headsets.The only thing I do feel a Grand Canyon VR experience could do with is a second view from above to give a better feeling of scale."

I really hope that continues as the game continues to grow!So, the bugs so far.The first is with the DK2. Okay, if you're reading this in a few months time you may have the CV1, but the DK2 is almost impossible to run with the required runtime. There IS a way to use the game with the DK2 that works well, but it's a problem that a lot of DK2 users will have.Secondly, it is very much geared up to be controller based. The keyboard commands don't currently work, which means that unless you have motion controllers there's very little to do...BUT, don't let that put you off. They do seem like a great team and I'm really expecting these little issues to be solved as the game progresses.For the price, it's worth it. Get a bargain while you can..."

Now, to be fair, on my (pretty good) system I experienced a lot of judder and black smear / right eye vsync issues on my DK2, but I fault the young technology and my own setup, not the devs of this game, for that.

,Not Recommended,407710,23844486,"Posted: 26 June, 2016",all,GrandNoodleLite,"Short Review:The boat locomotion is terrably slow and unrealistic. Giant waste of time. The graphics are about what you'd expect from a VR game, and the gameplay is nothing special.Long Review:This game made me look up how to refund games on steam. I was only able to play for the first few minutes because I couldn't get anywhere. You can only teleport to certain locations, and then you're forced into a boat that you have to row yourself, which wouldn't be a negative if it was realistic. Here I am making these big broad gestures with my arms and I'm only moving an inch or two per swing. I swear it would have taken me a half an hour just to get to the other side of the lake. That doesn't even count the fact that I have no idea where to go. Is the starting area the only area in the game? I don't know, and I wasn't about to spend half an hour rowing accross a lake to find out. If the boat had some sort of automation or if you could teleport anywhere (like in other VR games) i probably would have kept this game, but the locomition system makes it unplayable. The graphics and gameplay are nothing special, and they don't make up for the horrible locomotion. Use your money to buy some other VR game..."

Unfortunately, it's rife with bugs and just feels unpolished.  It needs a huge dose of anti-aliasing or just any graphics options.  The paddle physics, while cool in concept, don't feel right.  They're very slow, even paddling with 2 hands.  There is some graphical bug which makes the water almost black at certain angles (like looking down), but it changes, which really takes you out of the immersion.  I thought the kayak might fare better, but it is entirely on-rails.  Why not give the same freedom as with the paddle board?  That would be great.  But I tried it and needed to re-center, only to find myself now underneath the boat!  I really wanted to like this, but it's so buggy and almost unplayable as is.  I would refund it, but it was so cheap I'll keep it so hopefully the devs will fix this up.  It has potential."

After the latest update the visual are extremely polished and look astonishing! You can relax on a railed boat ride or freely explore by paddling yourself.  There are a mix of smart AI and animatronic AI.  If you are on the railed ride you get a can of fish food that you can use to attract marine life to the surface!  Both the Night and Day modes are fantastic and the 3D audio drowns out the last bit of the real world!

The light and water effects look great as well as the physics and movement of the kayak and paddle. Not too much to do apart from paddle around the waters close to the canyon, but wow was that immersive and fun.

Maybe some sandstone canyon elsewhere in the southwest.
