Always re-raise them, they always fold most of the time and that is how i win easily. If you are chip leader always re-raise for the total of their chips = Ai folds. For the dev if I am chip leader and put all in 300 chips when the Ai only has 55 chips than I should not loose the game. I should only lose 55 chips. That is how pokers works. Anyways not much of a poker game or sexy game. Only 4 pictures. Hunnie pop had a lot more."

,Not Recommended,407720,26081774,"Posted: 16 October, 2016",all,Atombath,"Poker rules, which are simple, are implemented incorrectly. For instance, the big blind can't raise on pre-flop and blinds don't seem to increase.Bet calling isn't implemented correctly either. When everyone starts with 100 chips and they all go all-in, there shouldn't be a side pot. However, this game... finds... a way.Opponent decision making is terrible, timid and aggravating. There is no bluffing.To be frank, the characters in this game aren't appealing either.When you saw this game and assumed it was bad, you were correct.My search for a good solo poker game continues, but Poker Night at the Inventory or Governor of Poker series are immediately better. For the anime cleavage that is the crux of this game's 'design' you could do better, pretty much anywhere. If you get this for more than $0.50 you've over payed."

This time, they bring a much more familiar game to the table: Poker! The joy of understanding this game quickly faded after playing a few rounds against the AI though. Pot commitment is the biggest thing it completely lacks in my opinion, which results in some very unrealistic and derpy moves.If you ask me if I would prefer playing poker against sweaty men or pretty girls I would choose the latter, but when the AI can't even get the core of the game right there's pretty much no reason to play it. Unfortunately the game devs aren't known to add major changes to their games after release (example: not adding a proper tutorial to the Mahjong games which the majority of players asked for), so I'm afraid that this game will also end up not being played after extracting the Steam cards from it. However, if the AI does improve in the future then I will change this to a thumbs up review.Current verdict: Stick with the sweaty men. XD"

The game thinks that an ace high straight is a king high straight. The AI folds after the flop before anyone bets. If you shove all in with the nuts you will be called by all of the AI players 80% of the time even if they have absolute trash hands. The only thing you will learn about poker from playing this game is how not to play. Not worth any amount of money or time. Avoid."
,Not Recommended,407720,29404141,Posted: 21 January,all,TheToad,"Wow, I never knew Poker could be this boring.So far the Pretty Girls-games have been a bit hit or miss. This was definitely a miss.The art is typical Pretty Girls-style. Nothing special.The worst part about this game however is the AI, which is really bad. In one game, after two of the other players got knocked out, I got stuck in a 1-on-1 battle with the remaining AI. The AI would never bet or raise himself, but whenever I would raise he would call almost every time, just to fold in the end (or lose with a garbage hand).This game was a waste of money. Get one of the Mahjong Solitaire games instead. They are much better.Review:Mahjong Pretty Girls SolitaireReview:Delicious! Pretty Girls Mahjong Solitaire"

Think DOAX poker, with the eventual motionless picture of a hottie celebrating her victory when she wins.Very nicehotties, let it be said. Too bad nothing more risqué, though.I bought the game on sales for $1,50. That's a fair price for what I was delivered, and on that basis, I can recommend it. Do not pay more! Otherwise you'll regret your decision.It's that kind of game where you turn down its music, put up your own tunes, and chill out emulating your own casino with pretty girls by your side while you sweep the board.BTW, the people nagging about the difficulty obviously didn't make it past the first half of the girls. You'll have to stop and analyze for a few seconds. Nothing too fancy, but as I said, a nice distraction to chill out and feel like a boss."

The title is misleading beacuse there's no anime girls in it, just there ♥♥♥♥ing stupid♥♥♥♥♥icons, and there's no ♥♥♥♥ing poker either. The A.I. is dumb as ♥♥♥♥ and they just fold everyhand and won't shut the ♥♥♥♥ and talk nonstop.In Short, don't buy this game it's terrible, almost reaching brickforce levels of bad. Just do yourself a favor and buy the 100% Orange Juice DLC, or a case and get a ♥♥♥♥ing Negev | Terrain because it's better than this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game."

As in, it isn't all that great. It either decides to constant raise you, or it checks. But if you enjoy long drawn out battles, or playing against buxom  women, this is for you.In reality, I got it because it was cheap... and I collect the darn trading cards/badges... for some reason..."
