It has a great emphasis on (minor) puzzle solving and has a ""hide and seek"" style gameplay identical to Amnesia. The controls also feel natural as you explore the levels, and the physics are pretty good except for a few times when you have too many objects together in one place (things might bounce around a bit when trying to get past them).The graphics are exellent and the creepy, near perfect atmosphere puts you in the proper mood for this style of game. If you decide to read the notes that are spread out through out the levels, you get a well written story that helps piece together the reason behind much of what is going on around you. If you decide not to read the notes, then not so much.HERE IS WHAT PUZZLES ME!The game does say ""episode 1"" which might alarm some people.I have read other reviewers claiming that the game is 7+ hours long, but personally I managed to finish it in about 3.5 hours. I explored everything and didn't rush through the game AT ALL! So I'm EXREMELY puzzled that most reviews have so many hours of gameplay???I even went back into the game and replayed the ending to double check that I didn't exit the game pre-maturely... but no I did finish it :/ So unless other reviewers has left their game paused for long periods of time, I got no clue why they have so much game time.So do I think the game is worth $15-17 even with only 3 hours of gameplay...?Absolutely!I don't think you will come across a better indie horror game this year (especially considering all the bad indie horror games that has been released the past many months).Can't wait for episode 2! :)"

This is a complete game and probably about 6-8hrs long, although for me longer as I'm rubbish at it.  I'm not rubbish at the puzzles itself as they are quite easy.  You have to flick switches and sometimes use your powers to flick the switches through gates etc. Near the end you have to think a little but shame they couldn’t have more difficult puzzles throughout the game.  The bits I find difficult are when the women lurking around the corridors chases you and if you get caught you have to start that bit again and if you haven’t got to a save point you have to start everything from there again, I find this quite boring when you get caught several times but guess that could be me playing the game wrong or badly, Maybe some type of detector could be implemented, green for she cant see you, amber - be careful, red - she can see you....(run!!)The graphics are very polished, no glitches, runs smoothly and looks amazing.  Atmospheric graphics, done very well.  I was interested when I tabbed out, it said dx9 in the window (Directx 9), we are on 12 now...but doesn’t matter as it looks good.   The lighting and atmosphere in the game is done well, they have made good use of the unreal engine.  The sound is very good as well and will have you on the edge of your seat.There are a few bugs, I went through a fan once which I dont’ think was meant to happen and when you crouch you can’t crouch when on objects which sometimes becomes annoying, I hope they get rid of some of the bugs.Overall I have enjoyed this game and is worth the asking price, its definately one of the better games of its type.Graphics 9/10Sound 9/10Playability 7/10"

Maybe not full-blown PLATINUM...but definitely gold. Finally, another first person stealth-horror game worthy of being mentioned in much the same breath as Outlast, Alien: Isolation, Among the Sleep, and, of course, both Amnesias (♥♥♥♥ you all, I loved Machine for Pigs).In fact, there's Frictional's influence written all over this one; and believe me, that's far from a complaint. Penumbra, Amnesia, SOMA...there's plenty to put you in mind of ALL these games, as well as moments, mechanics, mapping, and imagery which harken all the way back to the glorious likes of the Half-Life, F.E.A.R., and Bioshock franchises (especially the latter).But make no mistake: this is far more stealth than shooter, so if you're one of those namby-pamby types who can't hack games where you're pretty much helpless, best shove that pacifier back in your mouth and go back to blasting zombies with AK-47s like the pack o' wimps you are. This is a PROPER horror game, for people who want a truly immersive, scary experience. Wusses need not apply. (And man, is that save system unforgiving at times!)I honestly thought I'd be waiting for Outlast 2 for a horror game this good, so given the recent bad news about that particular product being delayed 'til next year, this is a very, VERY welcome gap-filler indeed. We can only hope that future episodes: a. happen, and b. are every bit as good as this one.Oh, and in case you were concerned, it's not nearly as short as the words ""Episode One"" might suggest: even the speediest of speed-runners (who  surely shouldn't bother with mood-based games like this anyway) should take a few hours to complete it, while the rest of us slow-pokes can expect a nice six to eight hours of solid gameplay.So, perhaps the biggest question of all: is it worth seventeen bucks? Simple answer: Yes. Yes, it is.Verdict: 9/10.(PS Loved the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥mechanic, but in all sincerity, does our humble protagonist never feel the need to♥♥♥♥♥♥! A minor quibble, to be sure...)"

It almost feels like an unofficial sequel, not as intense, but pretty close. The 'Monster Presence' music is pretty good, the gameplay is fluid and the levels seem well designed. Sneaking past the creatures can be pretty intense."

Storyline is told through notes and some some text from narrator.Overall I'd say the story is 6/10 because it got pretty loose at the end.Gameplay is a 7/10 for horror game wise, motion is smooth though I found myself getting caught on some things while running.

I wouldn't say it was too close to the storyline through.I loved the music -- but then I turned it down, because in a game like this, to be able to hear every footfall is important.Sure, it was bloody and gory, but not nearly as bad as Outlast (which probably goes for most games :) )The length of play was extremely surprising for being an episodic game. Took me a few days to finish and some of the puzzles were quite challenging. I'd go look up a hint and go ""OHHHH"" because the answer had been staring at me in the face all the time.I would like to see MORE of the ghosts in the game though. I figured out I could hide from them early on and then they'd go away so I didn't have to deal with them as much.I would ultimately give this game an 8/10, taking 2 off just because I wanted more monsters :)DEFINITELY BUY THIS GAME and then leave a review so the devs know there's a dri8ve for an Episode 2!"

I really enjoyed Lethe, it had great puzzles and tense gameplay along with well designed levels. The story was okay, I would have preferred a voice narrator rather than reading a bunch of notes but it did not harm the overall experience at all, I feel like with Lethe the story is not really that important and you will enjoy the game with or without paying any attention to it. If your a fan of first person horror games with a terrifying amosphere, and most importantly you liked Amnesia, Lethe will provide a good experience for you. It's not the perfect game, it does have some issues relating to AI and I would have liked more of a solid story. Overall Episode one is a really promising start and I am highly anticipating future episodes to come."

I do like the whole telekenesis ability, but honestly the game feels more like a platformer and puzzle game more than horror. There is one jump scare early on and then the rest is just hiding. I love the horror genre, but honestly I didn't feel that constant level of hyper awareness and edginess that I've gotten from games like dead space or Alien: Isolation."

And the scariness is amplified by a very good use of lightning too. Great job people.Concerning the sound effects and music, I really believe they were very well chosen, precise, fitting, there aren't too many of them to the point you get disconnected from the ambience and there aren't too few of them to the point they'd become irrelevant. It's a perfect balance and they do participate in creating the unease and feeling of being unsafe I've felt all along the game. Great job on that too people.Now to the things I think could use improvement.Level design wise, there's too much of crossroads, check left, check right, check in front, repeat...it felt like a labyrinth much of the time but I made it through anyway...at some point I started  the game again  after a day, and I had no idea where to go, what to do, I even went back for 10 minutes thinking it was the way to go.The story-telling could also be improved, because the only exposition you receive is through countless notes, it gets repetitive...Finally, the telekinesis ability though interesting, as in Half-Life's gravity gun, never felt like it was mandatory since it could be replaced by a ""pick-up objects"" key but still was an interesting touch that definitely deserves working on, as I'm sure it shall become important to the story in the following chapters.A couple problems with ennemy despawning too, dunno if it's on purpose or not but in the end I think I've only died once to the maniacs...but still, their apparitions, as scarce as may be, litterally made me think ""oh♥♥♥♥♥♥"" especially the woman with her rattles, gasps, shouts whatever.They can easily be easily outruned and outwitted but just like all the AI in horror games.Overall I had a great time, great fun playing through this, another Indie developper I have confidence in, keep up the good work and bring us players even more scary moments and eerie universes...Worth a buy at 13€Oh and the bear traps...f*** you for those, I must have stepped into 80% of them lol"

At times, I admittedly would not play this game because I knew I would become absorbed (also like a book), and so I would play something with less immersion if I was on a time schedule.  Immersion is the biggest pro, and personally what I look for in any game I play.  The game actually made me, very much a grown up and genuine horror fan, jump a few times.  Yes, some of the scare of the game would be classified as ""jump scares,"" similar to a game like ""Outlast.""  Where ""Lethe"" differs, though, is that it is much more on the cerebral side of the spectrum, leaving one with more questions than all the necessary answers.  The best experience from a movie, game, or book would be likened to this game in that feelings, mofifs, images, and more are left swirling within the levels of one's consciousness.  The puzzles can be quite difficult, but strangely, it was the more simple ones that I seemed to get stuck on.  I really hope there will soon be an Episode Two so that the story could be more developed and some of my theories be tested."

No issue hitting 60 fps with 4xmsaa at 1080p max settings on a 290x.  I could probably go higher but i play on a 70inch 1080p tv and jaggies arent an issue so i have no need to try.The story has started to suck me in despite being told in written note form and the game has that just 5 more min vibe going for it.There are some issues playing with a controller along with some physics bugs and oddities.  Try walking into a chair!  The problems come when you get stuck on inch high objects or during platforming sections you might clip into something and then popout of the object and be pushed to your death.The audio also does a really great job of setting the tone.  Cant wait to play more but that could always change as i get further into the game

It certainly has a Frictional Games/Amnesia: The Dark Descent's/Soma's scary atmospheric vibe (i.e. hiding from horrific encounters and solving puzzles that require some thinking to progress in the game).  Like someone else posted in their review for this game today, it's not a short game.  For someone like myself who sucks at puzzle-solving, I think It'll take me roughly 8-10 hours to finish this.  This game has a horror-fueled/captivating story about an ""affliction"" that's caused the inhabitants of a mining town to go missing. Your character washes ashore to this location and is tasked with having to solve what the heck happened and why everything is so fk'd up about this place.  If more episodes get released for this game then I'm sold.  Great job devs."

,Recommended,407780,29261554,Posted: 14 January,all,Comrade Beaglsky,"Playing Lethe reminds me in many ways of playing Penumbra, and that alone is high praise. I must say that I am thrilled that this game is actually a *survival* horror - too many recently released games in this genre are effectively haunted house rides with no actual danger to the player, but there are environmental and sentient hazards abound in Lethe.The story is also engaging, mixing in elements of science fiction and mystery to an otherwise realist backdrop makes for some awe-inspiring spectacles later on in the game.Additionally, I must say that the development team behind Lethe is nothing short of wonderful. After I logged a complaint that a certain camera sway that the game employs by default was causing me nausea and discomfort, the developers came through in a number of days with a patch containing a variable I could use to tone it down to levels I found playable. Thanks once again for that, lads.Overall, I feel a lot of Frictional Games influence here - my single complaint is that sometimes the physics on objects glitch out a little and make it difficult to move forward, but that's largely rectified by a mechanic introduced early in the game.

Lethe is a walking simulator with creepy atmosphere and some jump scares.

The story is told via notes that you find and is kind of your standard creepy-plague-in-a-mine cliche, but with somewhat of a twist at the end.

The only thing I'd have to comment on is the pacing of the game, as I notice that a lot of the game is mostly platforming and puzzles and not enough monster encounters.The atmosphere is definitely familiar with vibes of Amnesia mixed with ""My Bloody Valentine"" (the movie) with the setting.  Be prepared for reading as THAT is how most if not all the exposition is delivered to you, through notes and documents.I have been streaming this game for my livestream via Youtube Gaming, and to sum it all up.  I REALLY enjoy the monster encounters.. but the puzzles, while nothing spectacular, seem to drag the game a bit while all I really want is to be chased by the lurking terror in the mine!You can watch me play the game here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi3FBYGDbYc"

The story took a little to jumpstart for me but it gets more interesting and FUN a little into the plot when a fun and revolutionizing game mechanic is introduced. Don't worry this isn't a spoiler, really.Seems that the consensus is ""Amnesia"" in all reviews, which is understandable, but I think Lethe resembles the Penumbra games even more. You've probably heard of them if you liked Amnesia - highly recommended for those who haven't played them.I'd also like to commend the developers for the atmosphere which stood by itself and was quite impeccable; the sound FX and especially the ""scary"" sounds really worked together in order to bring about that desolate, deep inside somewhere dark and strange, feeling. I also I got some ""The Keep"" vibes (an underrated, cult 1983 film from Michael Mann) but without Tangerine Dream doing the soundtrack. The music was very good too, it created the effect it should have created and did not bore me even once.I wholeheartedly recommend ""Lethe - Episode One"" to those who like scary games a-la Penumbra/Amnesia/Outlast and all the other endless games in that style that seem to pop up like mushrooms after rainfall.

It's not remarkable or especially innovative in my opinion, but it is still effective. You have stalkers, like Amnesia, but they're varied (like Clocktower 3 or Haunting Ground) instead of just one design; this is a plus. Both the environment and puzzles get a little tedious at times, since you're in a mine pretty much the whole time, but there is enough creepy ambience to make it work.The plot doesn't really do it for me, but I was never a fan of a lot of post-Amnesia stories (I'm not even a fan of Amnesia's story). The purple-prose, the befuddled young male narrator, the family secret, the crazy experimenter who wants to unlock the potential of this and that - it's all been done.

The atmosphere is unreal in this game, and it reminds me of Amnesia in the sense that it can scare you just with the atmosphere alone.

76561198078208116,Recommended,407780,31658409,Posted: 9 May,all,odoscoldbeak,"Hmmm - Super Mario Meets Amnesia game based on ""The Nightmare Man"" (1981)After the Mountain of Unfinished, Buggy, Unplayable Garbage from Independent Publishers that has flooded the market in recent years, coupled with the Big Budget AAA studios turning Everything and Anything into Call Of Duty, it's nice to find something that actually feels like a Game again. This is a work in progress so I'll just make a few notes for now.So far this has good Graphics which have a 1940's War Time Steam Punk look to them, but the inclusion of a record player with ""Les Paul's New Sound"" would place this between somewhere between 1950 - 1960.   In many ways The Nightmare Man was the perfect subject for this type of game, they got the monster down perfectly, and if this had more time spent on it then it could have been the Amnesia 3 we have all been wanting.What we actually get here though is essentially a Horror Platformer with occasional ""Hide and Seek"" elements which dosn't quite work. Sure it has a few scary moments and reasonable puzzles which require exploration, but interactivity with the environment is kept to a bare minimum leaving this game feeling much more like a BETA Demo than a Completed Product.Health can be regenerated by picking up Canned Fish lying around which includes a truly STUPID Munching and Gulping sound right out of Loony Tunes, there are also a few flasks of Medicine scattered around the place, again with that Embarresingly Cartoonish ""Gulping"" rather like that garbage Jonathan Boaks used to put out years ago. Aside from this the Sound and Music is atmospheric and appropriate but Massively Underused (think Resident Evil Zero).As I got this in a sale I am perhaps much more forgiving than if I had paid full price, nevertheless, it is worth continuing with from what I'v seen so far."

At first it feels like a set of confusing labyrinthine tunnels, but once you progress through each area you come to realise it's actually very smartly put together. It's linear in the direction you must go, but the way it twists and turns, and how you come to areas you could previously only see, and how puzzles are implemented, all adds up to giving the player a great sense of immersion and is also satisfying to complete each area. Couple that with the terrific atmosphere and depraved setting; it all works extremely well and will keep you compelled to finish the game.My only suggestions would be to add a lean function for the player so you can peek around corners and objects. There were a few times I was instantly spotted and then killed when I was simply trying to look around a corner - a lean button would fix this. And I also think giving the ability to hide under tables, inside lockers, etc, just generally more interactivity within the world could add more depth of gameplay for when dealing with monsters."

You are not buying a Unity horror clone of something else.The game revolves around the supernatural and starts out leading you one way before turning the tables. I was often scared, confused, relieved when I solved a puzzle, but sometimes I felt myself backtracking more than I would like after missing something that blended in with the environments. Nothing deal breaking.My one point of contention is the controls. In tight corridors you will find yourself getting stuck on corners, on objects, and with someone or something breathing on your neck it can mean certain death. I used a controller after losing my mind with the keyboard and mouse setup. It was a much better experience for me.

Using only three characters (including the player) the studio has created a suspense-laden atmosphere rivalling anything from Alfred Hitchcock or Stephen King's hand. The soundtrack feels like fingernails on a chalkboard, and the modest screen-time for the 'enemies' echoes Ridley Scott's first Alien movie with similar results.Add to this a clever (sometimes a bit too clever) use of in-game problem-solving and you have a rock-solid, spine-tingling, and ultimately very rewarding game experience. The final encounter with the enemies is unexpectedly poetic with maternal tenderness amid the blood and gore.I've already persuaded my friends to buy this game, and I eagerly look forward to the next Episode."

Explore the environment, read logs of those who came before, solve some puzzles, and figure out what's going on.  Except that last part never really happens.  It may be due to the episodic nature of the game, but the game ends somewhat abruptly, and very little gets explained the further in you go.You start on an island, apparently trying to find your birthparents / birthplace.  This causes you to search into a mine, with some sciency stuff going on, but it starts devolving from there.  By the last third of the game it just feels like you're playing the second half of Amnesia or SOMA again.  There's little explanation as to what's going down there, and I found a grand total of one letter that even referenced the title of the game.Enemies are few and far between, and are almost always thrown up behind you (I counted at least 3 points where an enemy was placed behind me and I was expected to run).  The AI is also pretty poor.  One enemy just missed me going around a corner after I crouched no more than 10 feet away into the darkness.  As soon as the AI loses line of sight, they seem to completely lose it.  To remedy this, most of the places you run into enemies are tight maze corridors.  At least once I had to bait an enemy just to get around them, because the AI froze in the middle of the pathway.At the same time, it can still be nerve wracking.  The enemies screams upon sighting you are actually kind of chilling, and it can be hard to say where you may see an enemy.  it's not perdictable like Amnesia was, and you can't just sit in a corner for 5 minutes waiting for the enemies to despawn either, you have to find a way around them.  There's also no combat, so hiding is your only option.Back to the storyline, again, it starts off great, and there's a few things that hold a good air of mystery surrounding them, like the golden pillar / statue you see at the beginning.  The game just fails to deliver on answering the mysteries, or just leaves you hanging at the end.If an episode 2 comes out, I may pick it up, just to see where the story goes and if it improves."

If this is a title to show what the developers are capable of then this is good. However this game was in development for quite a while....and it seems like it's stuck in mid- 2010. I felt ""Penumbra"" as I played this and my suspiscions were confirmed the more the game went on. THe game got really ""weird"" and Cthulian which I feel is really getting played out. New horror/adventure games like SOMA are backing up off that and gonig into deeper avenues of horror, like how do you know that you actually exist or is life a great lie, not really about the spooky unearthly space beast. I was really upset by the second half of the game as it tried hard to plug itself into that Cthulian horror type. If this was just about being stuck in a mine and trying to get out, while suffering from thirst, hunger, fatgue and the various chemicals used in mining than this would of really been a great hit.Below is my review of the game, thanks.So far, so good. I was a little worried that this game would be an Amnesia clone but it wasn't. I could do without the ""psychic powers"" meme as it rarely makes sense and is mostly gimicky. The story so far is great. I get a real ""Penumbra"" (I think I speeled it wrong) feel the deeper I go into the mines. I only experienced one crash and this is after the hotfix update but it hasn't happened agian so that's great.

,Recommended,407780,24838400,"Posted: 12 August, 2016",all,Gabi,"As an entire package Lethe - Episode 1 is a game that I imagine will sell rather poorly due to the influx of games that took ideas from Amnesia then proceded to essentially copy them badly. Whilst Lethe does take multiple ideas from Amnesia and other games like Bioshock it does so in such a way that creates its own identity and has a fantastic atmosphere and a reasonably engaging story. Graphically the environments and the small number of animations you have are splendidly done and the game runs exceptionally well. Likwise some of the notes you find along with what happens are genuinely haunting.Which leads me to the games biggest issue. The ""monsters"" in this game simply are not scary. Don't get me wrong one in particular is conceptually haunting, but there presentation in terms of character models and animations are terrible as are how they interact with the world. Simply cutting them out and having one visible briefly but not hunting you (required for story purposes) would have been far better as whilst the game built up an amazing atmosphere, the big bads cause a large amount of effort to dissipate as soon as they show up.The game is also not complete per se, in that it is clearly set up for episode 2. An episode which very possibly will not happen given how poorly this game has thus far sold.Would I recommend this game? Yes. Even with the above fairly noticable issues I think it is worth picking up for fans of the genre. If you are not a fan of the genre then this will do nothing to change your mind."
