,Recommended,407900,29470450,Posted: 24 January,all,ηoeliare. ★,"Princess Remedy in a World of Hurtis addictingly fun, humorous and cute! The only downside is, the game is kind of short. I am a sucker for classic ""retro"" styled of games and this game gives me that nostalgic feel like I was playing a game from NES or Gameboy.By the way, it's free (I mean who doesn't like free games?) and you could also get married in the game as well. :DRating: 9/10"

Takes an hour or so of gameplay depending on difficulty."

76561198170478306,Recommended,407900,29478589,Posted: 25 January,all,Father Faithless,"I highly recommend this game, it is super cute, short, and sweet (free to play as well). the game itself is simple, you go around the world as Princess Remedy and heal the various denizens of the game of their ""ailments"".  it has a gameboy look and feel to it, with a certain Dr.Mario vibe without the puzzles, the battles take place by simply speaking to the sick characters and engaging in a bullet hell like auto-shooter where you defeat their illnesses manifested as different monsters. The game also has a very self aware sense of humor with plenty of references to other older games, the progression is simple enough you collect hearts to unlock gates leading to each section of the game. it'll take anyone about 30 -45 minutes to complete the entire game, and if for all the completionists out there it might take 2 runs to get every upgrade and chest. The final boss alone is worth every minute of the game, it is completely hilarious, I'm not going to spoil it but any final fantasy fan should get the reference right off the bat. all in all a super cute, highly original free to play game. play it, you cannot go wrong."
,Recommended,407900,30094206,Posted: 21 February,all,The TV Dinner,Fantastic game. Neat idea for a story and world executed really well. Battle system and fights tough without being too frustrating. Retro graphics fun and crisp. Would absolutely recommend.

76561198063920595,Recommended,407900,29436029,Posted: 22 January,all,Egres122,It set out to do what it wanted and did it. No bloat or anything. I can only assume they made it free so people would try it and see that they know how to make a game (and buy their sequel).

,Not Recommended,407900,30206563,Posted: 26 February,all,LonM,"Speaking technically, this game isnt very good. It seems to be scaling in a way that makes everything blurry, the game seems to be running extremely slowly, upon starting it it failed with an error about dividing by zero, and this all goes for both ""launch modes"" of the game. Upon exiting the game, steam seems to lock up thinking that it it still running.Basically, this renders it unplayable for me."
76561198031529307,Not Recommended,407900,29541722,Posted: 28 January,all,actionorb,"3/10 It's an ok little game with some funny dialogues which takes less than a hour to complete.*Edit (since many people are irritated why I don't recommend it)*:The problem with the recommendations on steam is that they are given by many people for mediocre games. I only recommend games, I want other people to take note on. That's what recommendation means. It doesn't mean ""it's was an ok game, I felt entertained for a bit, but I will never think about this game again, nor feel the wish to talk to anybody about my experience with this game."" The price tag does matter, but that doesn't mean every free game is worth a recommendation. A thumbs down doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad game, for me it only means it's not in the circle of games worth recommending. At least that is how I interpret Steam's binary voting system...."

,Recommended,407900,29470530,Posted: 24 January,all,DAFRANT,"Cute little retro-graphic bullethell shooter. Very basic in that you talk to people to get to an ""arena"" of sorts and fight their illnesses and fears. The little dialogues make the game really neat though, the developers put a great mix of charm, emotions and humor into the little 2-sentence-conversations.Gameplay gets pretty challenging (if you are just awful at bullethells like me) and the variation of enemy types makes it interesting enough over time.Recommended for people who like: A short, heartwarming experienceNot recommended for people who don't like: Pixel art, indie games or simple gamesPlaytime: ~1.5 to 2h, I guess some replay value"
,Recommended,407900,29530655,Posted: 27 January,all,Pitfall Seed,"This game is really exceptional. Although the graphics may seem lackluster, the gameplay offers hard but fair challenges throughout. It may be short, but for a free game, that seems fine. In addition, the harder modes offer a very, VERY large challenge that is nearly unforgiving. I may have only spent less than an hour on the game, but I can tell that it is exceptionally made. My only gripe with the game is that the overworld movement is a bit gridlocked compared to the battle / heal sections, but it's a small annoyance at worst. Considering this is a free game, everyone should at least try it.( I haven't mentioned the music due to my laptop having broken speakers, but if it's as great as the rest of the game, then it'll most likely be amazing. )"

76561198083575340,Recommended,407900,29686585,Posted: 3 February,all,dajayjay,"It's a fun game. Not very long, but worth the price you pay. A bit like space invaders in the sections you're fighting the diseases/sicks, gotta be fairly quick with good reflexes. I think the graphics might irk some people, but I found it endearing - dark background, fluorescent colours... kinda like oldstyle arcade games. Not too much of a background story, but I don't think it needs it."
,Recommended,407900,29680248,Posted: 3 February,all,Joycdonnell,A very fun and super short gameboy-size game (it took me an hour because I couldn't find the last missing heart).It's like those old Atari games where you have to destroy an enemy in the screen while avoid them and their shoots. Your character autofires while the action button are the bombs so pretty much you only need to move the control stick/WASD keys.Good music and challenge. The best part is that is FREE! (10MBs should be nothing for our PC storage standards)I like very much the concept.You should try it.

76561198225478796,Recommended,407900,29933319,Posted: 14 February,all,HaseoGhastly,"This is a retro style game with cute characters and funny dialogue.  You play as a girl named Remedy who is tasked with healing the prince of Hurtland.  Her friend had the same mission, but she didn't finish the job and never came home.  To gain experience you're sent to heal the people of Hurtland first, and then aid the sick prince.  You might even find out where your wayward friend went.  I thought this game was interesting, and felt compelled to obtain the jealous chest.  I'm just glad I already knew how to get it before I started playing."

An RPG plot doesn't get more simple than that.Overall, the 8-bit soundtrack and graphics goes well with the game itself, which looks like it could perfectly fit on the NES as an earlier title. Another great part about this game is the fact that there are so many secrets hidden within the game, but I won't tell you. You'll have to find them out yourself. Then there's Healing Mode. Oh boy. Healing Mode. If you don't know how an enemy attacks, you may fail on the first try. Overall, it does get easier. If you can't beat something, go find some gear and then get back to it. But if you still can't beat, then I don't know what to tell you. Just play another game.Princess Remedy in a World of Hurt is short, simple, a bit difficult, but real fun to play."
