,Not Recommended,407980,19133566,"Posted: 17 November, 2015",all,Quibber123,"This VN is literally Sakura Beach one but with a new character. You would think with it being a sequel along with it taking place a few months in the future that there would have been some development in any character between the first and second right? Nope. It is literally the exact same game. All the same jokes are used (and reused), it follows the exact same story, it takes place in the exact same location, the two original female leads are still abusive, and the main character learns from his mistakes about as well as a block of lead. There actually quite a number of choices in this game, but they all are completely pointless changing one sentence and sometimes they literally get ignored. I'm not kidding there are times where the main character or the person he is speaking to will literally ignore what you chose rendering your choice obsolete. That could be funny as a one off joke in the story, but it happens so often that I really want to ask why the choices were even put there.On top of that this VN wasn't even entertaining in the ""this dialogue is hilariously bad"" sort of way like the other Sakura titles. While those were all incredibly shallow VN's at least they were unintentionally quite hilarious. This one on the other hand was just really painfully bad. While I am usually able to get quite a few laughs out of these games I couldn't even really laugh at this one. The only thing this VN has going for it is that it's short. I'm talking an hour shorter than the first Sakura Beach short. Pick this one up on sale folks.If you're someone who genuinely enjoyed the first Sakura Beach then this was made for only you. For anyone other than that demographic look elsewhere for entertainment."

,Recommended,407980,18996156,"Posted: 10 November, 2015",all,Lanshaft | TROWIN SHRAKS,"If you're a fan of Winged Cloud's other games in the ""Sakura"" series, then you'll probably want to pick this one up too. If you haven't played any of the ""Sakura"" games, then let me brief you: these are basically short story VNs that heavily feature cute girls who often find themselves in compromising and sexy situations.The two Beach games in particular are done by the other artist working for Winged Cloud, Inma, as opposed to what you may be used to in Spirit, Angels, Swim Club, and the like, which are done by Wanaca. Inma does have a different style, but I personally like it and think it's a good change of pace, and having more good artists on board allows Winged Cloud to tell more stories like this.Onto the actual VN though:Beach 2 picks up a couple of months after the ending of Beach 1, and lets you choose which ending you receiving in Beach 1 at the start of 2. It continues the story of the love triangle between the protagonist, Seiji, and his two lovely childhood friends, Momoko and Ayumi, as they take another trip to the beach from the first game. While I think reading the first VN helps a lot in setting up the characters, I don't think it's a hard requirement.This time though, they meet a third girl, Nene, who is a bit of an oddball, and she gets tangled up in the complicated relationship the other three share. Funny and sexy hijinks ensue and are then brought to a conclusion at the end. This one does have a much more firm conclusion at the end, though I could still see the possibility of telling more stories with these characters, depending the direction the writer wanted to take.This VN does give quite a lot of options and choices throughout the game, but from what I've played they just change dialog options, and in this particular one your ending is decided upon the last choice you make in the VN. I actually kind of like this style, since I'm the kind of person that likes to read the routes, but hate it when I don't know which choices matter or not. So when I hit the end and realized how they had done it, I was rather relieved that I didn't have to go back and decipher which choices affected what throughout the story. This is different from Beach 1, where depending on the choices you made you ending up with one girl or the other, or both.Some people may consider stories like this shallow, and honestly they kind of are. But for me, sometimes I just want short and charming like this. People might criticize the characters for being rehashed archetypes, but I personally find myself just laughing at their ridiculous behavior or the silly situations they get themselves into. These aren't the most inventive characters or story you'll find out there, but that doesn't mean they aren't enjoyable entertainment. I also wasn't a huge fan of Nene compared to the other main girls, but I appreciate the dynamic and shake up that she brought to the story.The game does reuse character art, background art, and music from the first one, but I don't consider asset reuse a bad thing. They did obviously expand on it with new character art for the new girl, Nene, as well as 20 new CG scenes, so that is something to look forward to. The music from the first one still holds up as well.A side note: This game doesn't contain any explicit content like some of the other Sakura games that have outside patches, since Inma doesn't do that kind of art. Personally, I'm fine with this since I can appreciate and enjoy the art without having the girls being naked and showing all their bits.Bottom line: This is another cute short story from Winged Cloud with lovely characters in it. If you want a short read (~3.5 hours) with some funny, sexy characters in it, you should check it out. I know not everyone may be into Inma's style of characters, but I think people should give it a chance, as its nice to see Winged Cloud using more artists to tell more of their stories."

Lets hop to whats wrong first.-All of the choicesexcept for onehave NO effect on the story AT ALL one playthrough unlocks the handful of cgs available.-All of said cgs are vaugely erotic poses with ""convient"" censorship not like I was expecting full frontal or anything extremely NSFW, this is steam after all but I'm an all or nothing type of person.-Does anyone own pants? Am I the only one bothered by this? Who goes on a trip and doesn't pack a pair of pants or even a skirt? Who knows!so with all that what does that leave? Well, I enjoyed the art there were a handful of poses between the 3 characters that you ever meet but the few cgs that weren't ""eroticish"" were nice to look at. The story could of been way worse I dived in knowing it was going to be a ""harem"" type story and you should too! So be ready for the inconsistencies that come with this type of story.All around I give it a 4/10 I was hoping for more (no pun intended) and instead got a MC that is scared to kiss a girl, in a harem, on a beach where no one remembered to pack shorts."

There's no additional background artwork, no new music tracks, Momoko and Ayumi have exactly the same character models as they did in the last game...The best that can be said about Sakura Beach 2 is that it is longer than the first one by about an hour and a half; however, this turns out to not be a positive thing as the story is apallingly bad. Somehow, Ayumi's character has gotten far more annoying than she was in the first game, and by the end of the game you will find yourself hurriedly skipping through her scenes just so you don't have to listen to her cringe-worthy dialogue anymore.For some reason, the appearance of a new girl makes the choice at the end of the last game completely moot, as none of the characters act like Seiji is in a committed relationship.When you add in the numerous spelling and grammatical mistakes, it becomes clear that Sakura Beach 2 is the worst game Winged Cloud has ever made."

Good artwork, animation, sound, story, gallery, english subtitles, background music.  The controls and UI is usefull.  Very tame artwork, a little ecchi like 2 girls in bathtub.  The Story about 4 childhood friends on vacation at the beach, 1 geeky guy (the protagonist) and 3 girls.  Basically a continuation of the Sakura Beach story. Looks like some Yuri and Harem inside.  You can get all the gallery from skiping through and pick the first answer to each decision.  Might be cliche.Has 19? minor choices that change the dialogue in the section some.  Has three different girls to interact with. Has Ecchi and fanservice stylings.  No patch needed, the artwork is as is.  Good for a few hours of reading.Get it with the Sakura bundle, when on sale.  Could be worth deep sale price, if you really like visual anime novels, but not the hentai kind.  If you want just the ecchi artwork, you could save your money and look at what others have posted on netz.

It appears that the relationship hasn't developed that much (based on the ending involving first kisses). While contemplating this, Seiji encounters a new girl, Nene, who is a rich young woman, living in a mansion, but who is very interested in astronomy.The opening choice of the game involves picking the ending you had in the first game, and at the end, you finally choose who you intend to pursue, whether Momoko, Ayumi, Nene... or all three.Which I guess one should expect from a Sakura title..."

,Recommended,407980,31657702,Posted: 9 May,all,PUT IT IN REVERSE TERRY!,"Sakura Beach 2, an interesting sequel to say the least. At first I thought that a sequel was pretty stupid, because what else can be done in order for another sequel. I mean the endings from the first game made it pretty clear what the future of Seiji was going to be.This game begins by building upon the endings that one chose from the first game, giving further detail to what has happened to Seiji, Ayumi and Momoko, and their current relationship status and issues. Which I thought is good; it builds further into their story (of each endings, obviously) and adding more detail. But I guess that isn't enough for the justification of a sequel nor will it satisfy an audience (who are probably mostly hungry desperate men) so they go a head and add another waifu into the mixture. As if it wasn't already hard choosing between two...But overall I thought this sequel was good though - Spoiler Alert - instead of having an ending (if you choose only one of the girls) where the relationship is still a bloody mess. The endings clears things up between Seiji and his friends, which I thought was good for an ending.10/10 Would reccomend!"

But after going through the game, it was pretty stupid that the main character didn't want any ""girls"" to either kiss them, or flaunt their goods in his face. Most guys in that position would happily accept the two-lovers thing. So having only two options for a majority of the game, was pretty silly. However, I quickly found myself engrossed in the story, and where it would go. I don't think I'll be replaying it anytime soon, however, I can definitely say it was worth $2.74. Is it worth $10? Maaaaaaaaaybe. I mean, the art is BEAUTIFUL! There is a genuine care for the characters, but there is a ""I wouldn't do that"" feel to a majority of the statements, or choices made in the game. This game would benefit greatly from Telltale's The Walking Dead series, where they give multiple options for various parts in the game. However, I can fully say that I did enjoy the game, and after seeing through all the endings, I can say the game was good. I even felt myself feeling sorry for the other women, when choosing only one character.All in all, I can say this is a good game. In my honest opinion, it'd be more affordable if it was $7 at most, but that's just me."
,Recommended,407980,24791298,"Posted: 9 August, 2016",all,ankoku,"Continuing from the ending of the first game, you're immediately started off with a choice which, unsure if it matters yet, asks you something seemingly important.It basically asks who you chose in the end of the first game but I'm unsure as of now if it affects the route of gameplay. Especially because I skipped through tons of dialogue.lol whoopsMoving through two familiar faces and dialogue, I wondered ""jfc how can this get any weirder and still cap my interest?""Your protag encounters another girl, seemingly strange who shares his same personal interests, and yet is completely innocent and seems almost more clueless than he is. She practically forces friendship onto this ""stranger"" she just met and asks about his friends, not knowing his predicament (see the first game). Things get even better when she meets his other two friends and they exchange thoughts on the situation.Yet again: cute art, music isn't annoying, a little more text heavy this time, more choices(though to be honest I'm not sure if they affect the outcome because I still got all the unlockable ""scenes"" or portraits in one playthrough).Still, a nice follow-up to the first game. Can't really choose which I prefer over the other, but if I had to choose, I'd go with this one just because new girl is a cutie with a booty.Tl;dp (too long; didn't play),new girl gets added into the harem and you can actually specifically choose one girl or ""all of the above, please"" because harems, my dudes."

,Recommended,407980,18969544,"Posted: 9 November, 2015",all,Atrocity,"Sakura Beach 2 is a suprise in itself in its release and does some interesting right and wrongs.The story picks up a few months after the first Sakura Beach where the three friends return to the same beach to have fun. The introduction of another character Nene is both interesting and conflicting for me as I was playing through it. Nene seemed more like a  chance to add more conflict and events to occur among the cast of characters as the two main female characters Ayumi and Momoko continue to fight over the MC despite what seemed like a solution to the problem of the first VN where both girls were fighting over the MC. I liked the way the story introduced her and her interactions with the other two girls, but the transition to her becoming an option seemed too rushed and convienent for the MC and the player to decide on her. The good thing that comes from this though, is the chance for resolutions of  some unresolved issues between the MC and both of the girls  from the first VN when one girl was chosen over the other.  The story starts out with asking you who you chose at the end of the first game which is a nice addition but only changes a few lines of dialogue and has no major choice effects. This urked me because the ending choices while nice, were also conflicting because the premise that is set up at the end seems to throw every build up event that led to the final scenes from the first VN seem completely irrelevant since you could just randomly choose specific choices at the end and everything would magically reset and be ok among the cast of characters. It all just seemed reather underwhelming.Asides from the writing / story quirks, the art and music are always a big highlight and are enjoyable from the many beautiful fan service scenes of bikini shots and some other amusing scenes to the relaxing and mischievous tunes that played during scenes. There are about 20 scenes to view in the gallery/extras and you can get them all in one playthrough since there are unfortunately no specific scenes for different routes. This made it unfortunate in stressing how insignificant your choices were since the end just seemed the same.Overall fans of previous Sakura games will still enjoy this in the standard quick fan-service pick up fare of most VN's in the Sakura franchise, but I would be wary for those looking / hoping for a change in the format. I thoroughly enjoyed it despite of some of the cons and look forward to the next VN in the Sakura series."

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and draw a 7 inch (18 cm) circle on the paper. Turn the parchment paper over so the circle is on the reverse side.In the bowl of your electric mixer, with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites on medium speed until they hold soft peaks. Start adding the sugar, a tablespoon at a time, and continue to beat, on high speed, until the meringue holds very stiff and shiny peaks. (Test to see if the sugar is fully dissolved by rubbing a little of the meringue between your thumb and index finger. The meringue should feel smooth, not gritty. If it feels gritty the sugar has not fully dissolved so keep beating until it feels smooth between your fingers). Beat in the vanilla extract. Sprinkle the vinegar and cornstarch over the top of the meringue and, with a rubber spatula, gently fold in. Spread the meringue inside the circle drawn on the parchment paper, smoothing the edges, making sure the edges of the meringue are slightly higher than the center. (You want a slight well in the center of the meringue to place the whipped cream and fruit.)Bake for 60 to 75 minutes or until the outside is dry and is a very pale cream color. Turn the oven off, leave the door slightly ajar, and let the meringue cool completely in the oven. (The outside of the meringue will feel firm to the touch, if gently pressed, but as it cools you will get a little cracking and you will see that the inside is soft and marshmallowy.)The cooled meringue can be made and stored in a cool dry place, in an airtight container, for a few days.Just before serving gently place the meringue onto a serving plate. Whip the cream in your electric mixer, with the whisk attachment, until soft peaks form. Sweeten with the sugar and vanilla and then mound the softly whipped cream into the center of the meringue. Arrange the fruit randomly, or in a decorative pattern, on top of the cream. Serve immediately as this dessert does not hold for more than a few hours.Serves 6 to 8."

It just felt a bit more rushed, and put more on that final choice rather than which girl confessing depending on choices throughout.Still a really nice VN though. The new character was definately great for entertainment value :) Solid 8.5/10."

,Recommended,407980,31694724,Posted: 11 May,all,The Angry Sakura Game Nerd™,"A continuation of the sakura beach story that flows very well with the previous story. in my review of the first game I basically said that both 1&2 are my favorites of the sakura games, they dont have much porn, but they do have a good ammount of romance/drama in them to keep the reader (or dominant arm excersizer) happy. The characters are all very lovable in sakura beach 1&2, all with their quirks that really do grow on you as you read through. This game adds a nice twist onto the sakura games, trying out something new that ended up pretty well,adding a third girl to the mix. the game gives you pretty free will on the ending if you make the right choices too, which is refreshing to see instead of going back to quicksaves when you regret your decisions.overall, if you are buying this for the porn and want to support the winged cloud team, do it. but if you are looking for a SUPER SERIOUS DRAMA FILLED ROMANCE VISUAL NOVEL avoid all sakura games. these VNs are meant to be enjoyed and give a comedic feel like a rom/com ecchi anime, not taken as seriously as a Triple-A title."
