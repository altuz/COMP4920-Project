76561198006301097,Not Recommended,408000,19167529,"Posted: 19 November, 2015",all,alec100_94,"The Game has pretty much been summed up in other reviews, but I just want to give a quick insight.  When I first saw this game on steam I thought that it would be a game in a similar vein to Illusion Software's titles, based around the neat-ish concept of Cindrella. I thought it was kind of cool something like this could actually show up on steam (on the front page), as it gives it a greater feel of legitimacy, and I couldn't resist the low price. I saw the R12 rating and done some research, obviously finding about the so called ""R18"" version of the game, I installed the unoffical patch immediately before playing. See Paragraph 4 for differences.I jumped into the game kind of expecting a different sort of experience to the one I got. I was expecting something light weight, and relaxing that didn't require a huge brain or time commitment and was perhaps mildy sexually stimulating. After Playing The First set of Dungeon's (basically the tutorial), It was clear it wasn't that, I expected some crazy over exaggerated japanese story to kick off (around the actually decent gameplay), with some explicit content in it.The Game reminded me of Atlus' (excellent) Catherine for a bit, with the block puzzles and general themes. Sadly the similarities stop there. This game basically has no story content outside of the openining cutscene. After finishing the first set of Dungeons, I moved onto the second, only to be dissapointed. I only really went as far as I did due to nostalgia for how good that game was. The sad thing is the puzzles in this game are actually half competent. Someone has clearly put a bunch of work into making them, but the game needs some substance to hold it together, and it has none.The Whole ""R18"", ""Adult Game"" thing is simply ridiculous, and truthfully a scam, as well as a marketing ploy. There is one file difference between the two verisons (file can be found via many steam community guides). And the fact they they are charging 3 times the price for that version is ludicrous. Even in the R18 verison the adult content is extremely light. I switched back to the R12 verison for tetsing purposes. The only additions in the R18 version are more sexy costumes to buy, the ability to remove her skirt (seriously no where near nude), Also a breast size slider (You can scale a polygon), and lastly the inclusion of Torture Traps. The last one is the most meaningful addition as it adds various traps you can interact with around the levels, which cause cindrella pain, They are generally very simple animations, definitely nothing to get *excited* over. I am not a fan of censorship, but this is hardly even that. The traps feel like they were part of the original game, the rest feels stupid and tacked on. There is no real reason why the R18 verison of the game couldn't have be put on steam, other than the fact it was being marketed as a game for adults, and probably so the developers could trick you into paying for their version.The Gameplay itself is sadly ok. Nothing special but with an ok story and/or adult content elements (actually just and, there would really be no point in a remove all clothes button) this could be ok. It is a little buggy, jumping and movement could be a lot tighter, but it is sort of fun and somewhat challenging. If there was any reward for grinding through these levels at all (even if it was just a borderline bad story), then it might actually be worth completeing. And for some people it might still be worth completing. It is not a bad game by any means.The final verdict is this game lacks substance in almost everyway. There is no story, it has slightly buggy gameplay, and the whole ""censored"" thing is stupid. This game is very middle of the road, but regardless an interesting addition to my steam library and not a purchase I regret (Priced any higher I would have felt ripped off, but then I probably wouldn't have bought it). It's just a real shame the developer decided it wanted to market this game to pervets instead of gamers, with just a little susbstance, I would actaully go as far to say it's alright.Reccomended Yes or No is hard, I am going to say not reccomended, simply due to scam that is the R18 version which I did not pay for.Overall 5/10."

,Recommended,408000,19120989,"Posted: 16 November, 2015",all,Lysis,"Fantastically quirky short puzzle game. I haven't completed it yet, but I've been longing to play the game since played the demo a few days before the release date.The game is simplistic, I will not deny that. I also won't deny there are some rather janky mechanics due to the Unity engine allowing you to have a 'cheap' and unintended solution to a level. There is also some jank in the hitboxes of the swinging axes which can be pretty frustrating if you're not thinking and just going by appearance. The levels are rather open ended, so you can solve them multiple different ways.As many have said before, the game and its story are pretty short, but is novel and unexpected compared to the look of the game. The levels for the most part look the same and you'll probably end up well accustomed to the textures of walls and blocks, and the model of Cinderella herself (which looks alright in my opinion)There are a couple of customisation options in this version, not as many as the R-18 version you can purchase, but honestly, for such a game I wouldn't really worry too much about not having a skirt disable feature or jiggle physics slider- if this is something that you can't live without then I guess you should get the R-18 one, but this is basically the same game.So the game is what it is. For a £3-4 game, you can't really say you're not getting what you're paying for. The game works, and works well enough to be an enjoyable experience for anyone who isn't frustrated at puzzle games yet and wishes to sit there pondering the  next course of action!"

There are frustrating parts: kicking too many blocks, starting over. Missing jumps... starting over. Missing jumps because she didnt jump when you hit the space bar (that happened quite a bit - sometimes she would jump, other times the jump button was unresponsive).  It was very pleasing to figure out shortcuts on some of the maps.Fair warning tho... the ending does suck. I guess that's anime tho. If you look in the right place, you get an idea of what lies ahead.  Fun while it lasted but I doubt I will play it again. I don't share in Cinderella's sense of ""reward"" and I doubt most gamers will either.In conclusion, I recommend this game for the gameplay, but the ending really sucks. You are forewarned."

But the game is simple, and simple is good. You're a princes being held captive by an evil king, and rather than playing the character of a knight who goes to rescue her, you play as the princess trying to escape.Yes. The puzzels are fun, but I think the brilliance behind this game isn't so much in the gameplay, but in the concept and story. In this game, Cinderella is a sweet princess who is horribly treated, and on top of that, has the worst luck when she gets thrown in a dungeon for seeing something she shouldn't have. They make you feel very sorry for her. And I think what's great about the fact that you control her character, rather than playing as a hero trying to save her, is that you really feel like you are helping her escape. Like she has literally no friends in the world, no heros, no allies, but you. It doesn't feel like your playing as her, and that you as a player are the important one, but it feels like you are helping this character escape her horrible life. You, as a player, are the one force in the world who can bring justice to this cruel world the princess inhabitsSure, there could possibly be some far better puzzel games out there where you play as a dot trying to get passed cubes. But I don't care to see a dot succeed. I must help the princess escape! I'm her only hope!Most likely none of this crosses your mind when you play the game, but I believe everyone feels it in the back of their minds. I know this was very in depth for a simple puzzel game, but I believe it's all true, and just want to give credit where credit is due. So please buy this game. It's very fun and deserves your support!"

The puzzle are decently challenging, and the use of a limit resource system for jumps and hits keeps the element of strategy in place. The consistency is a bit weird though, with the over dramatic censors and that one 2D sprite for the godmother while everyone else is their 3D Model.The game could definitely use a bit of graphic face lifting and some changes to movement controls, as it feels things can fall out of place quite easily.This game is relatively cheap and a decently fun puzzle game. There's also jiggly anime♥♥♥♥♥♥and booty in it, which gives it 2 of the final 3.5 stars."

You push around blocks and break blocks to get through to the door.  There are swinging axes and shooting discs which will hurt.  That's everything.  For the most part it's easy, but the puzzles get a little unclear for some levels.  A great thing is there appears to be more than one way to solve a good number of these levels.  The R18 version has miscellaneous torture obstacles around which are easy to avoid if you know they're there, and easy to escape, but it does drain your health gradually.Over all, nothing is too challenging platforming wise, except for a few sections where axes swing with the path your traveling.Story: It's a nice story that really made me think.  There's two different endings, and the true ending makes a statement, if you're into that.  It's like old games where there's not that much story, but it's a really small game so I felt it fit.The downsides.  It's not cute.  This is a game for sadists.

The major difference between this and most escape games (besides the obvious S&M theme) is that this is more of a puzzler game.You move about in real-time in stages that are grouped to similar builds and have to first find the exit of each stage and then figure out how to get there. There can be multiple ways of accomplishing stages if you are clever.The character also has a linear level progression giving you more amounts of jumps (to elevate or cross) and kicks (to destroy blocks) that you can do as well as building HP to take damage from traps.I'm pretty neutral about this game.

,Recommended,408000,19991395,"Posted: 27 December, 2015",all,Trash Tier Player,"This game is a puzzle-based game with a tinge of eroge, well more on the bondage and torture part. However, due to Steam regulations, the one here is the R12 version, not the R18. There's not much difference between the two, except the R18 have the secret chamber, where you can torture Cinderella for your viewing pleasure (and I DO mean pleasure), and additional costumes.Gameplay wise, its a basic puzzle solving game. Move blocks here and there to create a pathway to reach your goal. At certain points (end of sub-level), you will get a bonus objective of rescuing your step-relatives from being tortured, but the catch is that you will be tortured in their place. Don't worry, you can escape from it. You can change the camera angle and view perspective to see where is the goal of the map. This is really much needed, as sometimes it may be obscured by obstacle.As for the difficulty, its pretty inconsistent. Some maps are pretty straight forward, while some require some retries to solve it. However, I cannot help but being shocked about a certain map, where all you need to do to reach a goal is a curve jump. Yes, you heard me correctly, a curve jump. No block moving, no obstacle dodging, no block demolishing, nothing else. Just a curve jump. It's a fast way for grinding money though. There was that one map though, where you actually need to get hit by the obstacle to reach the secondary objective. That was pretty interesting to me.Everytime you solve a map, you will get money and experience. The higher level you are, the more chances you are provided with jumping and kicking. They are not limited, they are finite, and once you run out of them, poor Cinderella can't even jump at all, or even kick. Kind of a hinderance, but at the same time its a challenge to use them wisely. You can spend money on just costumes. So poor Cinderella can be dressed as a gothic dominatrix, bunny girl, Santa girl etc. Nothing much here but fanservice .Since it's an eroge game, there are a lot of boob juggling physics and pantsu shots, since camera angle can be changed, as they are required to solve a map. Upskirts will be pretty common, heck sometimes I do that for fun. The biggest perk of this game is that, it's really cheap. It cost as much as a cheap lunch. It's not a very pricey game.Overall, a short and cheap puzzle game which can be solved in a matter of hours. If you want some fun doing puzzles (and enjoy the T & A at the same time), go ahead, give this game a shot, since it's really cheap, there's nothing much to lose. Mind you this is the censored version. For the uncensored one, please check the Steam community forums for this game."

R12 is a clever, kinky and interesting twist on the Cinderella storybook. Her Prince Charming is not as charming as you might think!  Cinderella must climb, kick, push, pull and intelligently make use of her limited resources to complete each puzzling conundrum within the prince's dungeon.Story:Once upon a time, there was a girl named Cinderella. She was very beautiful and she was kind to all.However, her stepmother didn't like her one little bit and treated her as a slave.One day a letter with an invitation arrived. The letter explained that a ball was to be held at the palace and the Prince would choose a girl to become his wife.She made every effort to get rid of all troubles to go to the ball.She was on her way to the ball, when she witnessed the Prince killing his father, the King, in order to usurp the throne.The Prince quickly claimed that Cinderella had killed the King andCinderella was arrested and locked in the deepest, darkest part of the dungeon...Can she escape from the dungeon?Will Cinderella have a happy ending?Only by solving and navigating the dungeons deadly traps with help from her fairy god mother, will she ever see the light of day again...Gameplay:Cinderella Escape! is a 3D Action Puzzle Game.Each puzzle requires use of the 3 main actions to solve the Puzzle and reach the exit.Cinderella Escape makes good use of RPG elements such as the level up system to allow for the player to increase the amount of jumps and kicks required to complete the dungeon floor.Gold can be earned in different stages of the game and used to purchase kinky costumes and extra content in a similar way to Blade Kitten.The puzzles vary from easy to mindbendingly hard while still being fair and completable in your first run through the stage. The game made me think twice before solving it, as one wrong move could send poor Cinderella into a pit of spikes...The R18+ Patch, which is not available on steam only adds some removed kinky content, but it is not required at all to enjoy the game.  In fact, I'd recommend not installing the R18 patch, as it doesnt add anything beyond asthetic changes.Art style and models:The art is in an anime-esque style that is well done and is reasonably suited to a game like this.The main character is beautifully colored, animated, textured and has a hand drawn look.The cutscenes are well animated with very few major problems across the board.The only complaint I've got with the game is that the translation is not as gorgeous as the art that accompanies it.The script is full of translation errors and some characters feel like their speech isnt as fluid as other anime based games.Conclusion:Cinderella Escape! R12 is an entertaining game full of kinky looking fairytale figures, a twist on the original story and unique puzzle concepts.Despite being nowhere near the end, I'd imagine this fairytale does not have a happy ending...But thats what appeals about these fairytale games, sometimes, things are not what they seem.I'd highly recommend this version to anyone who does not mind a little bit of kinky imagery and a few translation issues.All up this is a interesting game that is made better by its most recent controller patch.Score:10/10"

,Not Recommended,408000,34046436,Posted: 5 August,all,r0sshk,"Pretty bad as a puzzle game. Some of the levels actually seem to rely on the bad physics in order to be solved, while others can literally be solved without any puzzling at all. The second to last level (!!!) for example doesn't require you to touch ANY block at all and is solved in ten seconds flat, which is unforgivable.Sure, the character model is nice, but some of the extra costumes aren't even animated properly, resulting in bad clipping issues with legs and skirt.Oh, and don't be fooled by my play time. I had the game idle while watching Netflix. You can probably solve it in a bit over two hours. The ""True"" ending is not worth it, by the way. It's the exact same as the normal ending, with just a nonsensical flashback spliced in that causes the story to make LESS sense. Not that it does much to begin with."
