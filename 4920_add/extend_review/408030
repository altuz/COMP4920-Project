,Recommended,408030,30163573,Posted: 25 February,all,Codax,"This game is very simple - you have a little ship, you can rotate it, and you can hold onto a ball and shoot it. But once you start playing against others, you will find they are dribbling off walls, juking opponents, and making awesome plays.  Everyone has the same simple controls, but playing against someone who is good makes you feel like a 10 year old kid up against an NBA pro.  Luckily there are always ""noob"" games available to jump into, and the community is very open to new players.  There is something incredibly satisyfing about going head to head with opponents and beating them with creative plays and teamwork."
,Recommended,408030,30234779,Posted: 27 February,all,lormar,Fun game to try.Usually only one game going on at any given time.And new players aren't well received in ranked matches (90% of all matches).But it is a great game if you are lucky enough to find some casual players.

I found that all the older players were more than happy to help, as this game has quiet a steep learning curve, though it makes you want to keep playing as you can see the potential from the veteran players of what is possible."
,Recommended,408030,30232415,Posted: 27 February,all,SweeTARTS Candy®,"This game is amazing and similar to rocket league. Solid mechanic gameplay as the base and iteration based on that.Main gameplay mechanics:-Tons of momentum. You slide everywhere, so skillfull use of brake is huge and prediction of your momentum.-Prediction of the ball bounces off walls.-You slow down if you have the ball. If enemy bumps you, you lose ball. So you have to pass cause you slow down with the ball-Mouse is direction of pass. WASD keys are direction of car. Takes getting used to.Tons of different maps and racing minigames.Amazing game and tons of fun. I'd probably pay up to 5$ for this. Maybe 10$ if the graphics were a bit more updated."

Very welcoming and friendly community, variety of people playing from around the world.Haven't experienced any lag, played with some guy from Palestine and the UK while in Chicago on a European server.Hoping for flying pink walruses in next update."

My in game name was and has been ryok, i would say I started playing in the very early 2000s or late 90s? XPong?  Jesus I have no idea, anyways..Uniball is all about community, dont get me wrong the game is great but the community and competitive nature is what makes you come back for more.  So glad to see the game is alive and thriving, and most of all available on steam!"

,Recommended,408030,30157797,Posted: 24 February,all,Ataqer,A classic game. One of those games where the mechanics are simple but the gameplay is extraordinarily deep.I've spent many many hours on this in the past and I'm glad to see that it's back!

76561197976013775,Recommended,408030,30204944,Posted: 26 February,all,Edjren,"Uniball is one of the few games that I've played that is entirely skill based.  The basic mechanics are simple and the ships perform identically, which allows individual skill and team play to dictate the outcome of games.  Good players and teams will seldom lose to opponents with less skill, but really this is how it should be and is no different than any other sport played on a field or court.But this shouldn't discourage newer players.  The game is a blast to play at any level of skill and the staff and player base are eager to help new players find their way.In addition, it's possible to create private games where new players can play against their equally newbish friends and be terrible together, which is actually a lot of fun."

The game was being deserted by many players thanks to [hock] in 2015-2016, because believe it or not, not every player has time to sit through all the league routine. Some of us just wanted to have a good time and play the game. I'm glad to see that this game has been given another chance. There is no other game like Uniball, that's for sure."
76561198013472373,Recommended,408030,30213663,Posted: 26 February,all,Bone,"Uniball is an older ""classic"" style game we were accustomed to playing growing up. It's the type of game that is easy to jump into and play, but requires time/practice if you want to hang with the best competitively. I played it a handful of times 10+ years ago. I come from another ""oldie but goodie"" game (ARC) that has no direct connection, but is fairly familiar to each other. It's refreshing to see that Uniball has withstood the years, despite some hardships perhaps, and is now on steam thriving. Since joining the lobby and playing a bit the last couple days, the current community already in place has been nothing but courteous and willing to help in any way they can. Very newbie friendly, which is a rarity in online gaming these days. I'm a bit jealous, as I see mostly the opposite on ARC on a regular basis. I would highly recommend giving UniBall a shot if you are looking for something that can offer that nostalgia some of us older gamers enjoy while still being challenged from a competitive standpoint."

It has a diverse and unique community which has supported the game throughout its highs and lows, and NickW has shown clarity and determination to ensure this game continuously develops. From this, I believe the transition to Steam will rightfully bring UniBall into the spotlight, and thus giving the game the popularity it deserves."

It is time to continue to show the game some love and support! Friendly community and of course it is a small download. Takes like 60 seconds at most. Don't let the file size deter you though. It maybe a small download but one hell of a game packed into it.

The game mechanics are very simple and easy to learn, but it needs much time to really master the game. There are lots of different maps with different game modes, which brings a broad variety to the game. Each player develops an individual play style, which prevents you from getting bored. And as Uniball is 100% free, without any hidden costs, it is a must to download it (just a few MB) and try it out for yourself!10/10"
