The novelty of flying around is great, and it doesn't really ever wear off.I also realize that I had ultimately purchased a game that relies heavily on multiplayer. One of the biggest draws for me was the cross-platform play. Yet, 20 minutes were collectively spent waiting for other players. Somehow, across all three platforms, there's simply nobody playing. To me, the uncertainty of player support is a pretty big risk when dropping $40. The long waits, only to be met with rather boring 1v1 matches was enough to deter me.Note: Be weary of overzealous reviews. It seems the VR community enjoys overhyping things until the next best thing comes out. Polish and AAA quality don't mean anything in a multiplayer game if there's nobody playing it."

There are a few things that may put people off about this game and that would be:1. No motion controls, gamepad only - I love motion controls just as much as anyone, but the control scheme in this is actually really well done and to me it feels like the best way to do it in a game like this. You use your head to turn and the gamepad to speed up, slow down, shoot and use your shield. All in all it feels great.2. Price - Yes, the price may seem rather steep after the current trend in VR games and I definitely wasn't sure about the price either, but decided to brave it and I'm glad I did. You have to keep in mind that this is a game made by a big development house for what is still a VERY small market so the price will naturally be a little higher than VR indie games made by teams of 1-6 people and regular 2D games. I personally think it's worth the price right now.3. Uplay - There's not really much to say here, I'm not a huge fan of Uplay, but I'm ok with it. I've had my gripes with Ubisoft in the past and I'm sure I will in the future, but they are one of the few big time developers/publishers that seem really interested in exploring the VR market and supporting them could push others into it as well.The game itself is great fun, I'm loving both the singleplayer and multiplayer, but the multiplayer is especially thrilling. A beautiful, polished and fun game.One thing I would like to see that I believe isn't in the game yet is multiplayer voice chat, all 3 big VR Headsets have a mic I believe, so lets use them! Social VR is best VR."

Looks simple at first, but then, after you get to fly around the streets, between the buildings, it gets really intense. There is a single player campaign as well as a multiplayer crossplay. It is really fun, and so far the closest to AAA title we have on the VIVE. Really encourage you to try for yourself!"
,Recommended,408250,30824511,Posted: 29 March,all,Balto the Wolf Dog[Pvt Pilot],"Whether or not I reccomend Eagle Flight depends mostly on what you're looking for. If all you want is a VR toy, it's fantastic.  It's fairly immersive and the flight mechanics, while not as deep as I'd prefer, are intuitive and satisfying. The relationships between head position, view, and control are natural after only a few minutes, and highlight an aspect of VR I wouldn't have expected to work nearly as well as it does: With the right control scheme, a game can completely change the way you think about locomotion and navigation. Eagle Flight is the first VR experience I've gotten mild vertigo coming out of, as I'd grown to accept that tilting my head should produce a banking turn.Unfortunately the game underneath isn't nearly as strong as the mechanics it's built on. Eagle Flight strongly resembles something like PilotWings in that respect, or some modern mobile games. It lacks the depth and substance I've come to expect from PC games, and left me particularly disappointed with regard to how much being an eagle specifically plays into things. Hunting and combat are present, but not in any way that resembles how actual birds accomplish such tasks, nor simplified in a manner that enhances gameplay. Combat manifests as a simple projectile shooter with a time limit, with actual gameplay resembling StarFox about as much as any actual eagle behavior. Hunting, similarly, is reduced to a collectathon given challenge only by tight time limits. This represents a lot of wasted potential, especially since the strenghts of the game (control and sensation) would have played very effectively into a more realistic, deeper system, and are somewhat wasted here.The game plays very nicely, and given the fledgling nature of VR and comparison to other titles, the simplified, somewhat antiquated gameplay is forgivable. On those grounds I will reccomend it, especially if its on sale. That said, this is not a simulator in any respect, nor is the gameplay and progression at all organtic. There is fun to be had, but a finite amount of fun. The game is relatively short, and unless you're a perfectionist who likes hitting the top of scoreboards, you won't find much reason to stick around after the first few hours."
,Recommended,408250,28505217,"Posted: 21 December, 2016",all,Cariazam,"Well, I put my first hour and a half in on flying as an eagle and I must say I am thoroughly enjoying it. I was a bit worried about the gamecontrols and the lack of use of Vive controllers but I do like how the devs have solved movement. It certainly is good exercise for the neck muscles which is surely not bad after tense days at work. The feeling of flying like a bird is magic, as I had always wanted to have experienced. The graphics are smooth and well done. The lack of human existence in this game feels strangely comforting and Paris feels like a much nicer place without the traffic congestions. Gameplay is mildly challenging; it is fun to complete stuff although I am not drawn to improve personal bests after completing something. Might be because I am just hugely enjoying the soaring bit for now. All in all, well done Ubisoft. A very nice first VR title, hopefully more to come."

I don't enjoy sitting or standing and controlling with my head + a gamepad. Not a must have for Vive owners. Many people I know really got into this game. It's really well made, it's just not for me. Unless you can eventually use motion controls to flap your wings or control the direction, etc. I won't be coming back. Sorry  : ("
,Recommended,408250,29075150,Posted: 6 January,all,Jon Edwards,"A great showcase of what a triple A budget can do for a VR experience, Eagle Flight is a great game, and here's why. Upon starting the game, you're presented with a heavily styalised open world representation of Paris, set several decades after the end of humanity. This has resulted in the decay of the city with vegetation growing through buildings and exotic animals running loose through the streets. The style of the graphics looks great and the game runs flawlessly on my system. You play the role of a new born eagle facing the challenges of early life such as catching food and expanding your territory. The single player campaign then progresses as your eagle grows into adulthood with more and more difficult tasks such as fighting off crows and protecting your mate. Overall the campaign consists of 23 story missions each lasting 2-3 minutes to comples, and a lot longer to '3 star'. Accompanying these are several more challenging missions that unlock as you earn stars through the story missions. While the single player could be considered short, the open world nature of the game really allows it to become what you make it. Ubisoft have included collectibles in typical Ubisoft fashion, but it's fun to explore the city and find all of the hidden tunnels and landmarks.Eagle Flight also has multiplayer, which takes the form of a fairly simple 4v4 'capture the flag' style game, where each team of eagles has to catch some prey and take it back to the nest first. There is no progression to the multiplayer which is unfourtunate as it takes away from the replayability of the title. Furthermore, the small playerbase can make it tricky to find a game sometimes. With that said, although simplistic, the multiplayer is good fun and I still go back to it every so often.Readers who are prone to motion sickness, rejoice! I had no problems with the exhillarating flying motion in the game, and I have read that many other players have had few issues. Instead of turning your head to turn, which could get painful after a lengthy session, the game instructs you to tilt your head. This works great as it simulates how a bird tilts to turn and is much more ergonomic. The presence of your eagle's beak in the place of your nose also provides a stable point in your field of view that likely reduces motion discomfort, and the game has cleverly implimented subtle 'barn doors' that intrude on your view when turning particularly sharply.Ubisoft have really impressed me with this title. In recent years, I have found their products to have been underperforming, unpolished, and often feel incomplete. While this is by no means a lengthy experience, it runs flawlessly, looks beautiful, and is probably one of the most complete VR experiences on Steam."

Graphics are excellent/quite beautiful.  As others have pointed out, a real effort has been made to avoid motion sickness in a relatively subtle way (by blocking the edges of the view during rapid motion) and it's quite successful. Feels like so many other early-adopter games are looking for the ultimate FPS and I'm so totally not--this is the game for me."

So an Elephant will look bigger than it does to a human.  Just like this ENTIRE city in France, in scale, is bigger.  So if people say the map is small, ignore them, because the SCALE is BIGGER.It does kindof have the cartoony Prince of Persia/Assassins Creed feel to it.  MAYBE it's a spinoff of the eagle/falcon/hawk (whatever the FK it is!!) when he jumps into bails of hay.  (AC fans know what i mean)I finally got to play 10 multiplayer matches.  (hard to find people g*ddamnit)That's where the real fun is.In the LOBBY you sit, perched on a ledge with your teammates.  Looking across at your enemies, while head motion is tracked for all players.  Which is an AWESOME lobby to hang out in.You dogfight in capture the flag with a dead rabbit and return it to a SINGLE NEST.The strategy would seem to KILL the enemy eagle right near the nest, then swoop in and score a touchdown.And it seems some people are willing to bend over backwards for that PIECE OF MEAT!!!When playing single player time trials and checking leaderboards.  You may think to yourself my NECK can't handle this.  Or it's boring.  Increase the tilt sensitivity was my first thing.When I play online I say to myself WHAT is this guy doing to his neck!?They will slow down and get behind you and kill you.But then you become the predator, following this motherf***r.  You can smell the sh*t running down his leg.  It can get intense.But when you're being HUNTED you will go into desperation mode.  Just shaking your head around like a crackhead pidgeon.  It's crazy!It's such a PEACEFUL game, but I actually YELLED a few times.  Good thing there isn't voice chat.  (Which makes it more serene.)  When you run into a wall, you DIE and start over.  It will make you want to RAGE QUIT.  But you gotta chill out, and just flyyyyyy.Crossplatform!!  I'm hawking down PS4 guys and eating their scraps.I almost regretted the game until I played multiplayer.  Give it a try!I do find myself coming back for more.  Doing single player is actually really fun now.The more you play the more addicting it actually becomes.The price is a little HIGH though.  And when you see the models of the animals you might question your purchase.  But the fun and performance is there, and has replay value if more people were online.  Now I'm just destroying the ghosts on the leaderboards.  (you'll see 5 ghost eagles flying)If you meditate and do YOGA, def get this.  Stretch your neck out a bit.  If you eat McDonald's and stuff you might just need a chiropractor.  Still fun!  Stiff neck, I'll do it again."

No motion sickness at all. Some of the flying challenges are quite tough. Flying in and out of buildings, tight corners and tunnels to shave off that 10th of a second on your speed run is quite fun. There is a nagging message about turning your head that I could do without but once I sat down to play it never showed up again.Overall a great game for what it is. Its differnt but in a good way.

Great setting, intuitive steering, excellent music and graphics that not only don't give you eye cancer, but are the best I've seen so far on the Vive (except for some parts of The Lab and Portal VR, which is a community mod you should also give a try, if you own Portal 2).Some players wrote, that they miss the use of the Vive controllers. Well, I did not. For me the gamepad worked out just fine. But that might depend on ones playing posture. Mine is sitting cross-legged on the floor or couch for this game, and grabbing the gamepad gave me some kind of additional stability. Also you're only using the ABXY and the two trigger buttons.Imagining holding the Vive controllers, which would contribute nothing more to the experience, in front of me all the time, would eventually even reduce the immersion (although a mod, where you would have to hold them sideways and actually flap your wings would be hillarious).The ones of you who are accustomed to Ubisoft games, will feel at home immediately. Lots of stuff to collect for nothing but fun (mostly) ;-).You'll get a solid story mode, free flight and a sportful and entertaining multiplayer.

This frees that stuborn hate from my heart and replaces it with the awesome power of eagles.When i started out I was playing very much with my head and neck - it took a while to realize using your whole torso along with your head/neck is far easier to control, more accurate, and takes the strain off your neck.. I ended up sitting crosslegged on my bed and had good results.ALSO.. this is the first VIVE game that i can play to its fullest WITHOUT STANDING!

The flying feels great especially once you learn the nuances (which is important so you don't break your neck playing). The speed races underground are amazing and intense.. The missions that have you flying thru the city and chasing other birds and bats feels incredible and the enemies move very realistically swooping and diving all around you.

Honestly, I was a little disappointed. If the pricetag was much lower, I would have felt less disappointed. There are a lot of great things about this game, but what I was hoping for, what I was expecting, was to actually feel like I'm flying. There are free VR experiences out there already that manage to do that, but something about this game can't seem to capture it. There is no feeling in the pit of your stomach like you've just left the ground. No exhiliration, no real sense of flight. From a big game company, I expected AAA graphics, and instead got something a little more cartoony, and far less realistic. I can appreciate the art style they were going for, but for the price they're asking, I demand more.The narration and storytelling are great. I like the idea of moving your head to control your eagle. You do need a gamepad to play this game, though I don't understand why. A Vive controller could have worked just as well.I would pass on this game until the price comes down. It's simply not worth the money as it is now. I really like this developer, and I hope to see more titles come from them at a level of gaming I've grown to expect from them. VR is a new platform, yes, and some allowances need to be made while the industry figures out what's it's doing and how to make money with it, but with so many other VR titles out there that are providing amazing experiences for a fraction of the cost, I can't recommend this game."

The control scheme for me was uncomfortable with the head based turning controls and the seated experience. I played two multiplayer matches and though it was a novel idea, it wore off quick and just didn't feel like it justified it's price for the content."

To play a multiplayer game you have to sit there with the headset on waiting for a game, you should be able to at least fly around while waiting. Because of this I have never experienced a multiplayer game. I recommend it but probably not at the full price, because without being able to experience multiplayer, more than half the game is missing. I must make it clear tho, fantastic controls and amazing that they have virtually eliminated nausea."

Something that I don't get often in VR.  To date its happened twice to me.Once in google earth when I flipped back and forth between isometric and top down view accidentally a couple times and after about 20 minutes of eagle flight.I really want to like this game but the head tilting just messes me up.I wish I could make a neutral review but I have to choose yes or no."

Great to just fly around and enjoy the views, exciting to play the multi player game. As much as i understand that a great deal of the work lies in creating the map (Paris), it would still be lovely to see a couple more cities added later :)"

There is a black vignette that blocks peripheral vision when you turn or get close to an object. I wish there was a way to turn it off because I think the game might be fun without it. At the moment it feels and looks like an android game.

If you were ever that kid who would always answer ""flight"" when asked what kind of superpower you would want (like me), this game is made for you. It's exactly how I imagine it would be like to fly, simultaneously relaxing and exhilarating. It controls as satisfyingly as a hot knife through butter. And I love the smaller touches, like how you can always see your beak in front of your face (which surprisingly enough doesnt get annoying at any point).One thing I did notice is how the developers seemed to take a shortcut with some of the challenges by just reversing the story missions, having you go from finish to start, as opposed to going from start to finish. Normally I'd be critical of something like that, but I feel that this is a rare instance in which taking a shortcut in game development didnt negatively impact the game. The tunnel and crypt levels are designed in such a way that going backwards through the level still provides a challenge. It took me until I was nearly at the end of the game before I even realized that the levels were being reused! When they are hidden that well, I'm willing to give certain developmental shortcuts a pass. If I had one thing I'd change about this game, it would be giving the collectibles some sort of purpose, outside of merely being collectibles for the sake of it.Anyway, if you've ever wanted to bird, this game is definitely worth the price. This game taught me how to bird, and it turns out birding is a lot of fun."

Once done you are thinking that finally I can play so you put on your VR gear and try and play and suddenly you get a message to take off your gear and do their post account creation setup through Uplay. So I do what they say and it starts saying 10% ...20%... etc. and just at about 90% suddenly dies and no matter what I try it will not start working. I will never by from Ubisoft again that's for sure. Now to figure out how to return this game through Steam..

The room was spinning.  I wanted to throw up.  It was not a good time.  I am more sensitive to motion sickness than most people, so if you can handle flying in a plane or a riding a bus with no problems, you may be able to tolerate this game better.If it were cheaper, I'd keep it around for when my friends are over, but I can't justify $40 on something I'm physically unable to play."

The only downside, is although no where near as bad as some other games, there is a bit of motion sickness when playing, especially after full turns. Still a great game and one I would definitely recommend to buy."
,Recommended,408250,28538628,"Posted: 22 December, 2016",all,aneely,This is one of the best titles for the Vive so far. The game is built for VR from the ground up and it's so much fun. They've really nailed the flight mechanics to make this an enjoyable title that's accessible to get started playing. But as you progress the flight runs get progressively more intense until you're making hair-pin turns at high speed in very tight spaces. I think this is one of the best full games available for Steam VR right now.

The gameplay is relaxing and (sometimes) challenging, and enjoyable at all times.A good point (which I read in reviews before, but I've seen it a few times before in reviews in which cases it wasn't 100% true for me): Ubisoft perfectly got motion sickness (or lack thereof) under control.A minor issue is that you cannot reset (as far as I can see) the orientation (it takes the orientation of th headset during the startup of the game :/) in game.Movement is done very well though, and moving by titlting your head feels intuitive within seconds."

It stands out between all those other wave-shooters and racing games by combinng racing with combat and collectibles.It has beatiful and peaceful views but also features fast chases through narrow buildings.You can sink quite some time into getting 3 stars on everything and if you enjoy the setting it will be well worth its cost.

76561197970662937,Recommended,408250,28615070,"Posted: 24 December, 2016",all,Daye,"Okay, this game has been out since the 20th of December for the Vive and I've been on it a bit ever since.I have not yet delved into multi-player, but as this game is built for the VR crowd only, I would suspect it might be difficult to find a match since VR gear is still a semi-niche genre due to the costs involved.That said, the single player game effectively teaches you the skills you're likely going to need within the multiplayer scenarios and the single player campaign is a rather short one.   Still, it is quite fun to just fly about and do as you will.The game is rock solid.  I haven't come across any crashes or bugs as of yet but there are two caveats that we've asked the developers to look into that would improve the experience overall.The first is the "" tunnel vision "" effect.  I understand the why behind it and it's there to help prevent folks from getting motion sickness.  For those of us who do not suffer from such things, it is a distraction that tends to break the immersion effect.  What we have asked for is an option to enable or disable it depending on if we feel we need it.  Right now, there isn't any option, it's just locked in and we have to deal with it.  You can see it to some degree in the video below, though I tried to minimize the effect as best I can.  It isn't AS noticeable inside the headset, but it is enough to be a distraction.The second one is a message that will pop up in your field of vision reminding you that "" It's more comfortable to tilt your head, rather than turning it "" if you manage to offset yourself from the forward facing position.  Not much of an issue once you're accustomed to flying around with a VR headset on, but early on will wreak havoc when it pops up dead center while flying through a tunnel at 100mph.  Guaranteed crash into the walls forthcoming. :|We've asked the developers to make that a toggled option as well :DSome have commented on what looks to be dated graphics, but the game seems to play just fine as it is.  Remember, to run this stuff at 90fps you're needing some decent horsepower to push it.  Taking the graphics to the limits would probably be tough to deal with hardware wise without spending a minor fortune ( which would limit the folks buying your game )  but I suppose you could also make this a toggled option as well for those who do have the horsepower to play with.The way I see it, some of the timed courses are going by at such a pace you really don't have time to stop and ogle at the scenery.  You're doing everything in your power to keep from crashing into something.  To give you an idea, the video below is one of the timed courses where your goal is to simply navigate through the rings as quickly as possible.  As a timed trial, you're competing for the fastest times.  In other words, don't bother with the brake on these :Dhttps://youtu.be/1W5FG31EexQWatch that video then tell me you have time to complain about how dated the graphics appear to be :D  Also noteworthy, the difference between first and fourth place on that particular run is about ~ 1 second so the competition is pretty stiff.In the end, it's very entertaining so far.  Other than the stated issues above, I am rather enjoying it.I will give it 4 out of 5 stars deducting only for the items I feel should be a toggled option."
