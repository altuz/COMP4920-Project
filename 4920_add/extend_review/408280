IT'S AS SHORT AS FESTE'S TINY LAZY BODY. I felt like I was at the very beginning of my quest when everything had already started to end. I really thought I was in for a superb, asthetcly pleasing adventure. I thought I was gonna get miles of great plot and more fun characters and battles and it was gonna be great. THEN IT ENDED. This would've ended up being an amazing game if they had just made more of it. But, having it be so short really takes the fun out of the plot. It moves to quickly, and there's not enough substance to become attached. So, only get this game if you're ready for a quick jaunt through the woods instead of some epic indie rpg.Please, please, PLEASE remake this game or make some sort of sequel with like 10 more hours of content beause I will spend money."

Mostly it is light hearted and rather adorable. But the most notable about this game would be the art. Very unique and beautiful! Straightforward game play which make it suitable for older children too."
,Not Recommended,408280,32737588,Posted: 24 June,all,Aureus,"I would much prefer to use a ""neutral"" button, but since there is none...There is a lot of good stuff in this game. Some of the graphics, parts of the writing, some of the sounds, some of the fast-paced humor... Unfortunatelly, various part of the game are just idle and unpleasant. Some of the ""puzzles"" are, for example, ""press on a character and slowly drag it to your right"". Great puzzle, isn't it? Now do it 5 more times. Congrats, you did it! Do you feel dumb? You should.Very often the sound effects are cutting through one another in a chaotic, annoying manner or are getting very repetitive. Since the very beginning I was annoyed by the fake languages used by in-game characters, which were recycling the same voice tracks over and over and over again. A strong Meh from me.Overall the game is quite charming, but its unique artstyle deserved much better. I would recommend it for children who like to watch their parents playing adventure games - this one is so (intentionally) easy and has enough variety it won't be a problem for a kid. Adults should read more reviews and be very cautious about making this purchase if they want to play it themselves, though."

The other part is clicking on things, moving things, matching things up jigsaw style, and two turn-based ""fights"" where you need to choose among 4 options to make your numbers go up and your opponent's numbers go down.I liked it.There's a demo onmessage-quest.com."

It's original and pretty and is what drove me to buy the game in the first place.

Unfortunately, the puzzles are really easy, the story is one-dimensional and unimaginative, and the game isn't engaging at all... Over all the game feels like it's meant for young children (could be fun for them).I was quite bored during the 80 minutes it took me to finish the game and was relieved to see I was near the end, since I was just about to give up and uninstall it. I didn't enjoy the gameplay at all and the art (as nice as I found it) didn't make up for the experience."

This game is for you.I was looking for something short and relaxing to play - while looking at beautiful artwork - and this is why I chose Message Quest. What I didn't expect was to have my heart melted in a puddle of pink fuzzy feelings.Message Quest is family friendly and puzzles are not really hard. The hardest ones took a few tries to be solved and I got to finish the whole game in exactly 100 minutes.All characters speak an invented language - kinda like Sims do - but there's voice acting and it's so well done that it gives the feeling they are really speaking existing words.The plot surprised me. I assumed it was heading to a specific direction... but it didn't. There's a few plot-twists that I really appreciated and I truly found it inspiring and thought-provoking.I also appreciated all the times it broke the fourth wall: with elegance and purpose.Most of the achievements you'll get just by progressing in the story. A couple will need you to pay some more attention.The gameplay is mixed. A few turn-based duels that cracked me up, a few hidden objects and a few puzzles in the strict meaning of the word. Overall I enjoyed the variety and never got bored.Message Quest left me wanting for more. I'd really be happy if developers made a sequel, and possibly a ten-times longer one."

Great visuals, great music, a fun story with some simple but still entertaining twists. The fights are funny, the dialogs are unusual. It's simple, but for me it's an advantage - I wanted to relax, not to work the f*ck out of my brain. Also I have to mention A HELL LOT OF references to all kind of stuff (not the rip-offs, just refs, and they're awesome). If you like the genre - it' definitely worth getting.Should mention issues with integrated graphics though.

The music fits as well.  Enough puzzles to keep it from being a visual novel, but nothing taxing on the brain.

The art style is very fun and unique, the puzzles aren't really very challenging but are varied enough and there are some funny ""combat"" arguments/conflicts that also help mix things up and get you involved.The interface mostly works okay, athough it was clearly designed more for mobile/touch interface the mouse is workable, the main issue being it sometimes being a bit particularly about where you can drop items when you are dragging them to where you should obviously be putting them.The main plus is the characters and story, particularly the protagnist and the way you initially have to literally drag him around to get him to do tasks, but this isn't overused to being annoying, and his reactions in general, and Madlen and her troupe of kids.The main minus is how short it is - literally I am writing the review having finished the game and gone back to get a couple of missed achievements before the third and final steam trading card has popped up. There isn't a whole lot of replayability here either. But given the price and how much fun it is during this time I don't think that should really deter anyone from playing this. Also note you can replay chapters so if you miss any achievements you don't need to replay the whole thing just to get back to the same point in the game, which is a nice feature.Overall - definite recommendation without any reservations."

There is no indication on screen of what needs to be done with an item (sometimes you drag it, sometimes you click on it multiple times, etc.) and the insistence that you have to click on EVERY speech baloon to make it dissapear, just becomes horribly frustrating (you can't even click a random spot on the screen... and the glass crashing noise that makes gets really annoying, really fast.There may be a cute, fun game in there somewhere, but I don't have the patience to find it nor the compassion to overlook the many poor design choices."

For the rest of us, there are more engaging games available on Steam for the same price.Full Review:Message Quest is certainly a cute way to pass the better part of an hour, and all the bright colours and light humour make that hour a pleasant one. Yet my personal feeling is that this game should have been marketed to children, rather than being released as a purchasable game for adults on Steam.Now don't get me wrong - there isn't anything wrong with short games at all (Limbo, anyone?). But there's a difference between a game which is short because it was developed to be so, and a game which is short because you're flying through every challenge without blinking. If you're able to read this review, then chances are you'll also find Message Quest's simple little puzzles a littletoosimple to be satisfied with. For example: a recurring objective throughout the game is to ""dust off"" dirty panes of glass, revealing what's underneath. To dust, you click three times.Objective complete!And that's why I feel the developers have really missed a trick here. The simple and colourful selection of puzzles, along with the bright, cheerful art style and the overarching ""moral of the story"" message, would go down really well with children. It's just a shame that they aren't really Steam's target audience! However if you're reading this as a parent of school-age children, then Message Quest will be a great addition to your Steam library. Note: Message Quest does require a basic-to-fair level of reading ability, so either make sure you're on hand to help if your little gamer gets stuck on a difficult word, or turn it into a family activity and read along with them as they play. :)"

The combat is something I have never experienced before. And to be honest, for theridiculously low price of£1.99, I think this may just be the best game I have ever bought/played for that price (at full price). The length of the game is around90 mins long, but as with many other games, the short length is perfect for a game like this. If it was 2 or 3 hours long, my ADD would kick in and I would just forget about it after an hour in, leaving it to linger within my over-filled games library.So, surely there must besomethingbad with the game, right? Well, I do have one personal complaint but it is pretty minor. I might aswel show you the good ol' fashioned way by listing both pros and cons.PROS:+ Very low price+ Perfect game length+ Cute story, feels like you are watching a play of somekind. The game is very self aware (Knows there is a player, etc.)+ Interesting artstyle+ Combat is really interesting. I have never (personally) seen or experienced anything like it.CONS:+ Audio options are pretty bad. For example: Only ""Music"" & ""Sound Effects"" can be edited. Now, the problem for me was that I wanted to hear the voice acting (I guess you can call it that lol) but theSFX when you click on a speachbubblewas killing me. I think it was the sound of glass being shattered, it killed my ears.That's about it. If you want to sit down for an hour or so and play a cute and interesting game. Please give it a shot.Oh, andplease, for the love of GabeN, don't be ""That Guy"" and request a refund because playtime is under 2 hours.Time to farm for trading cards :P9/10(Would be 10/10 if more audio options were available)Good job, devs!"

For ~45 minutes of casual play at $3, I'm giving this a thumbs up more for what could have been, versus what actually is.The stained-glass aesthetic is enjoyable and the characters intriguing, but 45 minutes is absolutely not enough time for this story. The minigames were great and varied, and the battles actually well composed and very interesting for this genre of game.Unfortunately, the story lacked polish...in fact, it almost lacked story altogether; it was a true hodgepodge of story pieces mashed together in a barely coherent plot. Everything occurred far too quickly, and the dialogue, though amusing at times (including a few on point references) lacked depth of any sort. I do believe that were the story stretched to a four-hour game, the gameplay itself would have grown repetitive, but with the sort of charm and ingenuity to genre displayed here, I have no doubt the developers COULD have continued down a path of inserting more combat, new mini-games, and the like.I enjoyed that the point-and-click aspects of this game were logical (perhaps unusual, but logical nonetheless). My main complaint in so many P&C games is that the puzzles are so obscure I have to reference an online walkthrough (Deponia, damn it all, I'm looking at you!), which takes away from the fluidity of the gameplay. Message Quest, what it lacks in so many areas, does some of the basics right, and for that it earns a thumbs-up from me."

Overall, the puzzles (the few that were there) were too easy, or weren't really 'puzzles' but just clicking through dialogue until the story progressed. The battles were pretty fun, one of the few positive things I found about the gameplay. The animation itself is nice.Overall, story is meh, humor (which is part of what drew my interest in the trailer) is not really strong, and ending doesn't really feel like an ending...Would pass on this one.

I would keep playing if there were more translations in languages I can understand, just to see the world from another point of view. ♥ Everyone who have enjoyed reading The Little Prince (or watched the 2015 movie) can only fall in love with the designs behind this game. It sings the beauty of RPG adventures with most honest and childlike tunes.Gameplay wise, Message Quest is not just a cute simplistic point and click. There are mini classic puzzle games, turn based fights and basic roleplay elements. Just don't expect something big or long.I could not just play and not come back to give appreciation. Besides, it would be too lovely to see other game creators made games inspired by Message Quest, so here are the most shiny features (warning, small spoilers) :- character fights,- graphics,- the BO and its freely given Steam soundtrack,- the faint humor that seems to hesitate between dark and burlesque,- bits of a simplistic spoken language (I don't know if it's made from a real one)- the reference to Esperanto,- the dialog system making the player decide of what every character says, showing the player how something someone say can be interpreted differently and heard a conversation in a lighter or darker direction, but also saying that there can be more than one reason for a happening, and that, well, no one is perfect (not even the narrator),...All of these elements made my heart sing, long to hug every character, and broke through my usual misanthropy for a few hours.End of spoilers.The only negative point I can find is that I found the plot weak, and with too many unexplained things by the time it ends. But that may just be a wrong impression due to the devs not being native French or English speakers : which may have let to so some sentences in the Prologue / Epilogue not being turned in a way that gave sense and cause for the events of the game.If it was possible, I'd wish for two things :1. Getting to listen to the characters' songs and battle attacks in the Soundtrack2. Getting to play the whole game in Esperanto ♥"

The game has a distinct, stained-glass style with vibrant colors and characters brimming with personality. Feste, the lazy but lovable main protagonist, is so adorable it makes your teeth ache. I particularly liked the way the dialogue of the game was presented: not only the way the narrator constantly breaks the 4th wall, but also the hands-on approach of clicking the dialogue bubbles to continue the story. One of my favorites things about the gamw was the fact that you literally get to choose what each character says in order to create a more personalized approach to the overall story. Your choices don't have any real impact as the story is linear, but it's a fun experience to be able to choose what each character says, and how the story unfolds dialogue-wise. You end up feeling very involved in the story itself. I also really enjoyed the unique ""battle"" system, which is unlike anything you've probably tried before (for instance, Feste wields a mighty ""Puppydog eyes"" attack). The game will definitely make you laugh. The puzzles in the game are somewhat simple, but never boring.Overall, it's a great game for adults who enjoy a heartwarming tale, but it would also be perfect to play along with your kids."

The engine has several very simple puzzle mechanics (a couple of puzzles to assemble, and a menu-driven battle mechanic) that could be re-used to good effect to make more games, though the puzzle mechanics are so simple a sequel would be best targeted towards children.The story was strange, and not in a good way. Much of the English felt tritely written, probably a translation issue using a non-native speaker, and this added to the sense of the bizarre. It almost felt like a poorly translated fairy tale. The voiceovers (SIMS-type speech with a Russian flavor) were good.Other reviewers have pointed out that some screens became a click-fest, as the interface did not give good feedback as to whether an item needed to be clicked or dragged. All puzzles were solved on a single screeen; no inventory to take between screens; everything is on rails.

I played the game along with my daughter, and we had a good time following the humourous tale.  The art style suits the story very well.  The puzzles are incredibly simple, but challenge isn't really the point.  As an introductory game to play with a child, the game is great, but there isn't really enough content or story to sustain interest for long otherwise.  Fortunately, the game is brief, and the presentation is charming.  The ending doesn't really pay off, but my expectations weren't high in that regard.

I agree that some puzzles seem oddly easy yet others tough but I found after enough tries you could find the solution. I think the cast of characters are memorable and the writing is spot on. Music and Visuals were also spot on. My only real complaint is the length of the game and possible replay value. I know most point and click games, etc. only last around this length but I felt it had the potential to go longer. I also felt it could use something to increase replay value either by unlockables or harder difficulties (with the fights). While you can control the conversations on both sides, I don't think it affects the story too much.All in all though I really did enjoy it. If you're looking for a fun point and click adventure or even just a quick cheap game to 100% I'd reccomend it."

76561198161967955,Recommended,408280,34124429,Posted: 9 August,all,lostforever14,"Message Quest is a relatively brief point-and-click puzzle indie game with turn-based combats. I played it twice, first in Russian and then in English. Frankly speaking, the Russian (and original) version did not live up to my taste. In Russian the phrases hurt my ""ear"", it did not happen with English – here I want to notice that it's probably only my problem that has developed over the years of working mostly with English. Allegedly, there's a number of references to Russian literature and cinematography, most of which were not very easy for me to recognize. Basically, if you don't have anything against Russian language, you're likely to find the texts more fun than I did.I very much enjoyed the game's art that was made in form of stained glass. The characters talked in gibberish (in the matter of sound), which I understand to be classic, but repeating ""phrases"" soon became quite tiring, so the second time I played was with the volume set on low.To the first sight, the story is fairly simple: there's a dying world and we need to find a hero to save it. The protagonist in the centre of the story is facing his own Laziness and has to defeat it in the end, and I just love the idea and how the gradual process of the character's personal growth is showed, even though it's pretty straightforward. But in the bigger picture, there's more to the story if you pay attention to what is being said and look between the lines, more subtleties about the game's world and little pieces of some other story that maybe one day the developers will share with us, too.To sum it up, I'd recommend this game to anyone who wants to listen (broadly speaking). Don't expect any big action, it's more of a game to relax. The gameplay and sometimes slow animation kinda points towards the direction of a kids game. The focus is mainly on the story, but since it's a game, there is gameplay; but if in the dialogue choices you feel some freedom and being involved in the story and combats feel somewhat like action, the puzzles are, in my point of view, symbolic. Try it out and see for yourself."

Heralds are the background figures from the fairy tales who turn up to deliver whatever message sets the hero off on their adventures. Sure they are background characters but without them the adventures would never start. As for Feste, well, he is pretty much a failure who spends his time sleeping in the closet. But when calamity strikes the heralds college, Feste is the only one left to deliver the call to arms to the hero who will save the day. Can Feste deliver his message to the hero before time runs out?As mentioned this game is pretty cute. The graphic style presents the story as a stained glass window and it works quite well. The art style and animation serve to draw you into the storie's fairy tale trappings. The perpetually lazy and reluctant Feste is amusing and engaging and over the course of his journey he will meet a cast of intersting NPC's that will help or hinder him on his way. It all looks really good for a game that is going to set you back about the price of a cup of coffee.Sound and music are also very good with a nice orchestral theme underlying the adventure. There is speech but its kind of a made up language (I think, feel free to correct me if I am wrong) but despite not understanding a word, the speech does a good job of emoting the action on screen.With good graphics and music and a simple but engaging story, I really recommend this game.
