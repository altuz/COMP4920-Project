If you like puzzle games you will like this.  It is only just out, but feels polished  and responsive.   Good set of controls to mess around with fidellity in line with what you PC can handle."

I have some small issues with the UI and level selection stuff, but these will be improved. I met the developer at Steam Dev Days last week and I could tell that he is very passionate about this game. It's such a cool sandbox where you can already do so much, but in the future even more could be added which is exciting. If you like any type of puzzle or creation type games you should definetly get this. It's already well worth the price."

I was going to stop at 9:15pm no matter what.I finally turned it off around 11pm.My biggest motivation for not hitting the snooze button this morning is that the earlier I get to work, the earlier I can get home and start saving the world from floating balls again!  I cannot wait for this thing to be fully fleshed out and complete with large amounts of user-generated content!"

Good game controls and good level design so far.It was not clear to me how to certain stuff, such as delete blocks that I added, so I would say this game needs a level of polish. Great early access release though!"
,Recommended,408340,28177707,"Posted: 3 December, 2016",all,pvanderm,"Great game and a lot of fun. Even in early access most elements seem to function relatively well. The game only takes 2 - 3 hours to run through once at this point, but more levels are promised and I'm sure the workshop will provide an abundance of levels.If you enjoy puzzle games this is really a no brainer, and even in early access it is worth the cost for people who know they enjoy this type of game.With that said, there are still some glitches / things that need to be added, but the dev seems to be involved, so I'm sure this already great game will only become better with time!"

Very clever, kind of hypnotic, like watching the endless Rube Goldberg ball machines they have at science museums."

,Recommended,408340,30049064,Posted: 19 February,all,iHatePennies,"It's a great game, it kept me wanting to play from the first level to the last and I cant wait for more levels! It's basically ""Here's a stream of balls, get them over there, and here are the tools you can use."" Best VR purchase so far for me."
,Recommended,408340,32700377,Posted: 23 June,all,somehobo606,"Wew lad, this is literally the most fun I've ever had on the Vive. I've played a dozen games but this one takes the cake. Around level 2 or 3 when the ball shooter thing comes out, boy I was literally smiling and laughing out loud. And I live alone. 11/10 would buy again."
,Recommended,408340,32808302,Posted: 26 June,all,Craigor (ᴳѕ),"I enjoy playing this game, with VR games I am getting used to them being very short or overly repetitive, but this one seems to have plenty of content and is actually quite fun. Like many have said, if you used to enjoy playing ""The incredible machine"" then get this game, you won't regret it."
,Recommended,408340,26304536,"Posted: 29 October, 2016",all,Prominence,Pretty fun game I must say. Puzzles are challenging and it's great that it has a level editor. Check out my gameplay video on YouTube if you like.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpz9RImD28Y
,Not Recommended,408340,28959434,Posted: 2 January,all,dracolytch,"I really like the premise, though the game really needs more refinement (as of Jan 2, 2017).1) To finish some of the puzzles, you need to be tall and have significant head-clearance. I almost couldn't finish one of the tutorial missions because things were happening above my head / near the ceiling.2) Some of the tools and means to adjust them are too finnickey. Getting an accelerator to aim right is a real trick! Better refinement of some of these controls would make the game less frustraing.3) Get a new joke. Comparing me to a chimpanzee was funny the first two times. You can stop it now."

Even though I have played it a very short time, I was surprised how good it really is. I love puzzles and it has met my expectations so far."
,Not Recommended,408340,31892861,Posted: 21 May,all,CorreAktor,"Not very smooth. Have a GTX1080 with 7700K processor, etc. and the frame rate is horrible compared to other games. Just finished Batman, which was amazingly smooth at totally maxed out settings, so to me it is a game issue. It is similar to the game Awaken, which uses simple visuals, but I find that game much more playable."

,Recommended,408340,28833676,"Posted: 30 December, 2016",all,classixuk,"This puzzle game is absolutletly breathtaking. I'd go as far as to say it's the best VR experience I've had yet.I played on an Oculus Rift with Touch controllers, and you really feel as if you're there, surrounded by your puzzle solution in 3D. The touch controllers are represented graphically in the environment with 'menu reminders' pointing at each button when you need them.  Reaching out and grabbing a puzzle piece with the touch controllers really adds to the realism.The game has a full tutorial to get you started, and the levels build gradually, introducing new puzzle pieces to help you solve each room's 'mystery'.It can be played in a standing (or sitting) position and you can move my teleporting around your srtucture, or it can be played full room scale where you can walk around your structure.The puzzles are taxing, requiring a great use of logic and thinking to reach your end solution for each room.It really is phemoninal, and I can't wait to show this to my friends.If you've played ""I expect you to die"" and really enjoyed solving the puzzles in that short game...you're going to LOVE this one!Buy it today and begin playing...you'll see what I mean!""Must Have"" game for VR!"
76561198344708794,Recommended,408340,29283457,Posted: 15 January,all,shauniedarko,"I would recommend this game...with some caveats.  After playing and beating Bounce, which I enjoyed immensely, I was looking for something similar.  Grav|Lab seemed like a good choice.  It's similar in that you have a set of tools you can use to get objects from one part of the room to another.  There's some extra difficult in that instead of moving one object, you're moving multiple, and those objects can interact throwing off the trajectory.The graphics are good, but I can't help comparing it to Bounce again.  Where the graphics here are nice, they're bland.  Sometimes in Bounce, I'd just stand and stare out the window or watch the different objects moving about the room.  There's none of that in Grav|Lab.  It's a pretty standard room.  There's also no music.  The music was a highlight of Bounce, and I was really disappointed there wasn't anything at all in Grav|Lab.  The quiet clinking of the balls grows tiresome and boring.It's an early access game, so I'm hoping the devs will add some music and some variety to the settings before the final version.I'd recommend this game if you've already beaten Bounce and are looking for something similar.  If you haven't played Bounce, I'd recommend getting that instead of this."

It starts out simple, but there is a lot of complexity to play with here.If you like puzzle/problem solving games like Spacechem/Infinifactory, this game will be your VR fix. Alternatively, if you find those kinds of games intimidating, I find it a lot more approachable and intuitive in VR as well. No clunky controls to memorize, just grab the part you need and stick it where you want it go."

I've had a few issues where teleport drips you below the game floor outside the building so had to restart a level. Looking forward to trying level editor.
76561198004664689,Not Recommended,408340,34535109,Posted: 27 August,all,Malcifar,"Buggy and not worth the price. Graphics are not optimized and run more poorly than they should on a GTX 1080 sli hexcore I7 system. Also, when spawning items, it sometimes removes the most recently previously spawned item, breaking what you just set up. The collision detection when grabbing spawned items is a little less than ideal, as well. Kinda frustrating when you put all of these issues together. This game has potential, but should not be $20 and should not have come out of early access yet. I truly do enjoy this type of game, so I hope they intend to continue polishing these performance issues. Most VR games run beautifully on my system; I would like to see this one do the same."
