76561198263427469,Recommended,408410,34728975,Posted: 3 September,all,Rurik,"Good arcade game with poor TD and strategy elements.X -Morph Defense is the first nice looking game (if doesn't count Warstone) in the TD genre since KR Frontiers release. So, there were no question with buying it. I passed this game on Hard in about 12 hours. So, there are my thoughts.If you waited for a good TD game, you waited in vain, because it's not a TD game. Do you want to place towers? Yeah, ok, but destroy a hundred of tanks  and avoid a thousand of projectiles before. Yeah, the game contains TD elements, but they are bare to bones. There are 7 towers. Yeah, you heard right. Could we add TD tag to the game if there are only 7 towers? I don't know, really...There is everywhere on the store page is told ""Tower Defense"". So as a TD fan i was pretty disappointed, because first of all i waited for a TD game. ..... but i got an arcade game, a good one, with nice visuals and other cool stuff. I should admit, I don't like arcade games, but I liked this one.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1127427079About Gameplay.90% of the time you will move and shoot using X-Defender. You have 4 weapons for shooting, Plasma (weak and fast), Missile (Anti-air), Bombs (Splash ground) and Laser. Every weapon has charged ability: you can cast EMP strike or drop Dark Matter Bomb.So, you will use these things 90% of time until finished the game (12-14 hours). That's the thing i don't like in arcades, you should do the same things again and again. IT's getting bored soon.But, devs did good job, arcade part of the game is on the top. Everything looks nice. Killing enemies are pleasant, especially at the first battles. Visual effects are nice. I highly like the shoot effects. My favorite is Dark Matter bombNew types of units comes each new mission. You will force armored vehicles at the start, when tanks, artillery, bombers, heavy helicopters come. Each is weak for exact weapon or tower, so it makes the gameplay wider.You meet the first boss at the first map. Yeah, it was cool.There are 14 missions. Five of them are side missions. I am sure, it's enough. To the end of the game, the game couldn't offer you new experience, so it's good when it finished so soon. In addition, i think 12-14 hours is enough to satisfy your wishes.So what's about TD elements? As i said, there is 7 towers: basic, artillery, laser, flame and 3 anti air towers. Strategy part of the building is the simplest. If infantry comes - place flame tower, if tanks come place artillery towers, if heavy tanks come - place laser towers, if air forces come - place anti air. As I said, it's boring for TD fan.What I liked. Each level is a maze level. You can increase the path by placing towers and !!! destroying environment. Yeah, it's cool idea. You place Dark matter Bomb and a collapsed scrapper blocks the path. This is the only one strategic part of the game. You should build the longest maze possible. There are no more strategic, everything else is pure arcade.There are no armor types/damage. Enemies even don't have health bars (by default settings. you can turn them on. I didn't know that). So you can't undestand how many shoots/towers you need to deal with different enemies.Enemies almost don't have special abilities. Yeah, there a re healers and jumpers. I wanted to see more special units with interesting features as Resurrection, invisibility, stun, damage decrease and other stuff...http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1127427011ResumePros- Saturated arcade gameplay- Stunning visuals- Nice sound effects, voice acting and atmosphere- No bugs were foundNeutral- Enemies paths is changing every wave. Devs supposed it adds more interest to the game, but in real life it's just getting bored to check waves every time and replace towers. We want to place and upgrade towers, we don't want to replace them.- Each mission is really long. Sometimes I wanted to stop the game, because i was tired, but it was only 5/7 waves :D- Co-op mode with no LAN support. I undestand, you made the game for Xbos and PS4 in priority, but how should we play co-op at 1 computer without extra contoller or mouse. Arg...It's like to give user a car and didn't give him petrol.- Enemy forces of all countries looks the same. I understand, use different models is impossible, but I would like to see national colors at least. It's really strange, when tanks in China, USA and Russia looks the same.Cons- Poor TD mechanics- Skill tree for Towers and Defender is poor too. There are ~7 passive skills which doesn't affect gameplay at all. You can't upgrade the damage of your base weapons. So, you damage output at the first mission is almost the same at 14th mission. I think, devs should add more diversity to this part of the game- Story is boring. Plot is good, but everything else you got is just old soldier grumbling. It's funny to hear ""We experienced heavy loses"" or ""We have lost this battle"" during the first mission. But he says the same meaning in other words for all missions. And, humanity didn't do really interesting with aliens. There are no plot twists. Everything is linear.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1127426924ConclusionAs I TD fun i wasn't satisfied with this game. So I can't recommend this game for a full price for strategy fans. I think, you should take it with 25-50% discount, because even with a lack of TD elements it provides an interesting mix of genres and new experience.I play rarely at the games of not strategy genre. So I don't have much experience with arcade games, so can't say anything for sure. But visual are awesome, the arcade part of the game is cool, I liked playing it. So if you like games of this type - you should get it."
76561198015330730,Recommended,408410,34651538,Posted: 31 August,all,AutopsyGuy,"This game is BRILLIANT.Congratulations EXOR Studios for putting in the time and effort to make something that is both beautiful to look at while being very well polished, something most AAA games suffer from these days. At max settings the game looks and feels buttery smooth (constant 60 fps) even with numerous projectiles, explosions, and debris flying around the map at any given moment. The game is an utter joy to play. Anyone interested in 'Tower Defense' games should not hesitate to give this game a buy.That being said:===Shooting===The controls are very responsive and moving your ship feels very fluid, no clunky or 'sticky' controls which is great. There are 4 main weapons you can unlock throughout the currently available 14 missions each with a alternate fire that you can charge up for extra damage or utility. Each weapon is best suited towards certain types of enemies (you will be swapping weapons frequently). Blowing tanks to pieces and shooting bombers out of the sky is fun and satisfying and looks increadable. The buildings are all destructable with some of the taller ones being capable of dropping onto enemy vehicles and blocking their path toward your core.===Tower Defense===As with the weapons there are several towers you can unlock as you progress through the game. Each having a strength and a weakness. You can also create barriers between towers to reroute the enemy away from your core, making them take a longer route. There must always be at least one viable path to your core however so you cant attempt to turtle or wall off your core. Most of the tower strategy is revolved around choosing the right towers and using walls to reroute the enemy into the longest path toward your core as possible. Destroying the environment can impact this in your favor or to your detriment...I could go on but i'm sure most of you have stopped reading by now so in short:Shooting is fluid and responsive, controls are fully remappable, environments are destructable, game looks beautiful, strategy is engaging, game engine is very well optomized, presentation if polished, enemy routes change from wave to wave - the game is brilliant go buy it already"

Well, now you can. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game is amazing! It has everything, hundreds of enemy units, completely destroyable landscapes with collapsing skyscrapers, enormous bosses that stomp all over your defenses.It also runs buttery smooth, looks stunning, and is perfecly playable with kb+mouse. It even has a coop campaign, altough i havent tried that one out yet. Amazeballs!"
,Recommended,408410,34613961,Posted: 30 August,all,WindStrike,"This game is like if Michael Bay directed a Tower Defense game, and it's absolutely glorious. It requires you to constantly rethink your strategy from wave to wave, rewarding you with the joy of overwhelming destruction, and for your crazy maze ideas that let you loop the enemy around the whole map. Visuals are top-notch, I have yet to experience lag, which, given how much stuff is constantly exploding on screen, that's just down right impressive. The game provides a fair amount of the leeway, between the many constant auto-saves, your core has a lot of health, tower upgrades are full refund even when destroyed by the enemy, and you have unlimited time between waves to plan out your defenses. And the bosses. Holy crap I have never witnessed such visual fidelity in both trying to blow them up and watching them run over the city.Easily one of the most satisfying games I've played.EDIT: I beat the game, took about 12 hours, a blast (literally) from start to finish. It required me to do some pretty serious thinking and adapt my defense between each wave, which I found very rewarding.I then reset the campaign and am now attempting hard difficulty. Holy frigin' crap, it's really difficult, I've gotten a number of game overs/restarts and I'm only 1/3 the way through, BUT it's entirely doable. Hard difficulty requires a huge deal of on-the-spot adaptibility, sometimes requiring you to lose a wave in order to see how everything spawns in so you know what to kill first, what you need to run the longest path for, etc. Some of the waves, I thought my defense design was really cheesy cause I had some of the paths practically running circles. Well, as it turns out... if you don't have ALL the paths running circles, you're screwed, so trying to figure out how to do that each wave (and hard difficulty gives you less resources) is very satisfying when you finally pull it off.Twill edit again once I've beaten it on hard mode. Loving the challenge of the game; it has yet to ever be outright unfair. If your defense seems weak, odds are, there's a better way to do it, and you'll just have to put some good thinking and tinkering in.EDIT 2: Hard difficulty run took about 9 hours total, along with 6-7 game overs. It definitely requires a much more active use of changing towers in the middle of the wave and knowing when/where your fighter should be. A lot of fun to be had, I still gotta backtrack to try and gold rank everything. Last level felt pretty easy though, the difficulty ramp kinda went down for that level on hard difficulty.Great game, as a dev from Element TD looking for something new, while I wouldn't call this game revolutionary, it's incredibly well polished. To me, this is the new standard of Tower Defense games!"
76561197970358346,Recommended,408410,34714993,Posted: 3 September,all,BlackjackGT,"X-Morph: Defense reviewThrilling, dynamic hybrid of Tower Defense and Top-Down Aerial Shooter, featuring spectacular, screen-filling explosions and special FX, ear-shattering sound FX and varied technology and upgrade ability trees.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1127183037You can certainly see some Starcraft DNA in the graphics, the abilities of your Terran-ish alien forces and the 'harvesting creep' but down by your units. But X-Morph brings its own personality too.I've never been much of a Tower Defense game fan, and I think injecting a top-down shooter into it really freshens up the genre. While you can certainly focus more on one or the other, I find it works best and is most fun to use my ship to 'extinguish' hot spots on the map where the towers might need a little help to deal with enemy (Earth) forces.You get to place your towers, use energy fence connections to align paths so the enemy has the longest route, etc. before starting a mission's combat. Then as the battle progresses, you gradually earn more energy, allowing you to go into ""Ghost"" mode to place more towers during combat. Though I have some difficulty tackling that while the map is going crazy. :)Even though enemy paths are marked own on the map before a mission, it's still exciting and you still need to place towers, block paths, and fight with your aircraft in the right places to succeed.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1127239228Technologies and upgrades improve your main base, add different attacks/passive buffs for your aerial fighter and add different passive buffs and attack types for your towers.The first boss battle with the giant spider-mech (for lack of a better description) is spectacular but thankfully challenging in a fair way.This has 3 difficulty levels, and at least the promise of some future player-created content via a level editor, though nothing new's available just yet."
76561198061851387,Recommended,408410,34616088,Posted: 30 August,all,#77,"'I hardly ever post reviews'...but really I don't and honestly this game just crashed on me towards the end of the first level (wave 5)...lol...ugh. Either way that is to be expected at release. My first impression is HOLY CRAP though. I'm a big fan of tower defense games (Kingdom Rush, Defense Grid, Ext.) and saw this today when it released and gave it a shot. I know bugs will be fixed and I'm already blown away without getting to a boss yet (or finishing the first level). Hopefully my review doesn't sink too far down the pile. If your a fan of tower defense and space shooters, grab this while it's on sale. The haters will cry about a buggy game at launch but that's part of the biz. So far I'm truely impressed. Had to adjust some settings because explosions/debris were staying on screen and not disappearing. I do have an older PC though. Sweet game so far...well, off to try and finish that first level again. Great concept/Game.  Down with the Earth scum. \m/ UPDATE: I just beat the game, 9/11/2017 (R.I.P.) so it took me about a week and a half of some hardcore marathon's and a day or two off...My newest impression...Amazing, buy this game now. Great teaser at the end. My $ was well spent."
,Recommended,408410,34627992,Posted: 31 August,all,Dee,"only two hours in and i'm completely sold. this game is like blue goat cheese and fig jam. they're each very good on their own but combine them, and you'll end up in an explosion of taste :D. both the twin-stick shooting and tower defense elements are fast, fluid, and well balanced.performs flawlessly maxed out in 4K on my 4770K with maxwell titan x.putting up the path-altering walls can be a little finicky sometimes, the environments look kinda samey, and i encoutered a few purely cosmetic bugs. but none of that has negatively affected my experience in any way, and i'm looking for more, and more, and more. if you like twin-stick shooters and / or tower defense, here's me nodding wildly, go for it!"
,Recommended,408410,34664363,Posted: 1 September,all,Blattdorf,"X-Morph: Defense is a more hands-on game than is typical for tower defense games. You control a ship that can use a variety of weapons for decimating enemies and can also place various types of towers to obstruct paths, deal with particularly nasty threats and make it easier to handle the swarms of enemies the game throws at you with each wave. It all works really well and is incredibly addicting.I also really like how the campaign isn't just a series of maps with an arbitrary number of waves. Instead, your every success prompts some kind of reaction, giving context to your continuing rampage. It's unexpected in these types of games, but highly welcome!Highly, highly recommended to all tower defense afficionados. Don't be tempted to play on Hard when starting out as the game puts you through the wringer due to how different this game is from the usual fare."

,Not Recommended,408410,34708582,Posted: 3 September,all,Mashee,"This is a frantic shooter, NOT a tower defense game.  In it's own right, this is a GOOD game, however the bulk of marketing is targetted towards the tower defense audience.The best comparison I can make is to play Orcs Must Die with the shooter loadouts instead of putting points in traps.  In that scenario, you're always kinda' on the back-foot in a frantic shooter play style.  X-Morph's tower defense component is entirely secondary and the game's format plays in the afore mentioned OMD-shooter-loadout style.I cannot recommend this game as a tower defense title.  It is clearly a shooter with some very lose tower defense elements.  It is polished, but extremely frustrating waiting for the tower defense payoff which doesn't happen.Unrelated to game mechanics, the story is frustrating to endure.  Long winded, and largely redundant.  I can't handle listening to Uther (Warcraft) carry on about his half baked military revelations long after the player already understands...and aliens who contract their words while at the same time trying to portray a strict fully expressed dialogue is grinding to the ears.  Nobody of any mature gaming or literary experience managed to play an editorial role in the dialogue, story, or voice acting.  These felt like fan-fiction.If you're a shooter guy...buy it.  Plenty of frantic controlling and hot-keying to do.  If not...then this could be hit or miss for you."
,Recommended,408410,34615557,Posted: 30 August,all,growlingoctopus,"So this game is basically awesome .. even though (at least according to the leaderboards) I suck at it (probably because I mess around in it too much, whatever).GRAPHICS: Amazing. Decimation is the name of the game.  Even though it isn't the same, it has a feel almost like they took classic militaryesque  shmups like 1942, Raiden, etc and remasters the graphics from 8 bit to 4k and then some.  The physics engine is great as well; sure it's fun shooting at an insane onslaught of tanks, but it's even better when you can carve the bottom of a building out and knock it over on top of them in full HD detail.  The eye candy is amazing; if you don't believe that, watch a few gameplay videos.  The game speaks for itself.GAMEPLAY: The gameplay is great.  I have been waiting for the game since almost announce time (I have Zombie Driver and saw their announcement on the steam page for it at some point) and it sounded great, however I know a lot of things sound great on announce and you sit there waiting for months (or even years) just to find out the execution/actual gameplay is terrible, or the game's really buggy (see 'support' below re that), etc.  That is NOT the case with X-Morph.  The only minor complaint I have is I think it would be cool to have more upgrades for stuff like towers and weapons, but I'm getting the feeling that will happen in one or more DLCs in the future.  The game isn't super hard or super easy so it's not boring or overly frustrating and it has that great sense of reward with all the utter devastation (both to the environment and the enemy) you can cause.This game strikes a nice balance: it's a shmup and it's a tower defense, but it's not one or the other: it can't really have an insane amount of tower defense stuff or it will make the shmup part pointless, and if the shmup part was packed with insane weapons like a classic shmup, the tower defense wouldn't get much use.  Since enemies attack from multiple fronts unlike a shmup where they're all in front of you, it uses a nice balance: use the shmup aspects to clear out the big threats and do precision attacks and use the towers to keep things at bay when you're busy elsewhere.  Exor did very well balancing the gameplay.The only part of the gameplay that minorly annoys me is the 'last path blocked' mechanic... it just feels weird that you 'magically' can't block the last path the attackers have (however it's expected ... otherwise you'd just win by blocking everyone out without any effort).  Maybe a system where if you block all path the enemy gets artillery reinforcements that can clear a path would seem more sensible, but it would introduce unexpected behavior since you wouldn't know what path they would clear and it could completely throw off your defense strategy.  The last path blocked thing seems funny, but really I don't know a better way to handle that.SUPPORT:  I can't say that much for this, but what I can say is this.  I got the game yesterday on release, and in day 1 the game crashed at 3 random times with the same physx error.  I thought this is probably just a thing they missed, it's release day, hopefully it will get fixed soon.  The game is so good the crashes didn't even bother me that much.  Also, the one thing I noticed early on about the game is it only has 12 levels, so  I was worried about how much gameplay you get with the game.  It is only a $20 game though so even then that's not a huge deal.Fast forward to today, one day after release.  I go to open the game up for a quick morning play and see an update notice for version 1.0.1.  Along with other things, I see:- Fixed ""physx::ProjectionPlaneProperty"" crash- Added Level Editor (BETA - Windows 7 currently not supported in the editor)- Turned on Steam Workshop supportThis means that both things I noticed on day 1 pretty much got clobbered on day 2.  The base game is awesome but I can't wait to see what starts showing up for new levels in the workshop.Overall, I only really have this to say about the game ... if you're on the fence about getting it .. just GET IT.Original review: I've only done the first mission at this time so I might update later but I've been waiting for this release  for quite some time now and everything I've seen in game lives up to what I thought it would be: AWESOME.  I almost never leave reviews for games (this might be my first review), but I had to review t his just to give it a thumbs up because it's so cool and deserves an overwhelmingly positive review status ... tower defense meets shmup meets KILL ALL HUMANS meets demolition simulator 9000 ... and with all the eye candy ... I think this game will give me d-eye-abetes."
,Recommended,408410,34655342,Posted: 1 September,all,Shrike,"I am not enjoying the game but I dont give a thumbs down because I don't think the devs deserve that.The game is not bad but the format is just extremely one dimensional. Its is very much a arcade game you play through in 2-3 days and then dont touch again. For the high pricetag I expected more depth and more replay value.The thing is that XMD is another tower defense game with 8 towers. When I see a free flash TD with 8 towers I instantly close it, there is no way that <10 towers give you any meaningful decisions or strategic depth that is adequate for a full PC release. Every tower has one singular best usage and thats it. Even the extreme simplistic defense grid offers more there. I see that the devs saw the need of adding a upgrade system but it is just scraping the surface. The way it is set up and the contents it havs does not allow for any meaningful choices aside of when you are getting the upgrade.This whole mission and upgrade format is extremely outdated and severely lacking in replay value and meaningful choice.I get that the starship adds a new layer but I just expect good tower gameplay in a TD.The game is well done else, the physics are amazing and show a lot of effort going in and everything is polished. The changing of paths with walls is a good concept and I think the jet gameplay with dodging bullets and rockets works well but it just lacks the substance, id rather play any of dozens of warcraft 3 TDs which have enough replay value to play the same map dozens of times. XMD is technically well done and nicely polished but lacking severely in innovation, player expression and creativety. It is not trying anything new aside of merging TD with Shmup and it just scrapes the surface on the towers themselves."

Has co-op but at home same couch/screen co-op no multiplayer which i hope they add it at somepoint. i think this game would benifit more from that.  Which you can both use controllers or one has the use of keyboard and mouse while the other has the controller.Steam achievements and trading cards.Gotta check it out! Totally different with the top down feel with the aircraft just destroying things and placing your towers to help. Can controll the path they go also which is sick.If you go on starcraft to play the arcade tower defense games.. you will enjoy this.Money well spent!9/10  would be 10/10 if it had mutliplayer *** it has at home co-op**"

The graphics are stunning and performance is smooth.  The game is challenging if you play it as a straight shooter, but with good strategy, it hasn't gotten too difficult, but without getting too easy.   The voice-overs get a bit annoying after a while, constantly announcing the attacking waves.  Also, the ghost mode tower placing is a bit finicky, but after using it for a bit, it's not a game breaker by any means.  Definitely worth a try for anyone into TD and reverse-TD games."

It's a great game,I have not reached very deep into the game yet but so far the Tower defense system works perfectly,even making additional obstacles by building ON the path the enemy will use,mazing works quite well, bringing all spawns on a single path etc.Theres even some achievements for creating extra long enemy paths.Even on normal difficulty the game can provide a decent challenge and i can't wait to dive into hard difficulty after getting through once.The games artstyle is great, environments look good, the environmental destruction is great but could be even more awesome if the impact was greater (maybe i just haven't used it perfectly yet)good Level-up/progression system as far as i can tell,The scrap-collecting mechanic during the waves is a great addition and fits very well.(Oh and side note, I'm a fan of the way you skip through cutscenes by speeding them up, giving the option of skipping boring parts and playing important parts at normal speed)I should probably not write a review this early but at a Price tag of 20 bucks I 100% recommend it, because i can see it's definitely worth the price."

(using DS4 here)Graphics are well polished.Tough at times, but not unforgiving.Bosses are fun and diverse.Destructable buildings can be used for path alteration (nice touch devs!)Cons:Occasional bug; have had a couple enemies become invisible and stuck, it's rare, and you can see them on the minimap and attack them, but your towers won't.Building mid-wave with the recources you've collected can be headache inducing. Time doesn't slow during build mode (ghost), so trying to pop down a couple fresh towers on a far lane, can be really painful if you need your ship attacking a different lane to stop it from getting overwhelmed.If you're looking for some classic casual action, with a modern paintjob, and a mix of well mashed mechanics, check it out.(Really hoping for some DLC here.)"

Tower defense + shmup. Excellent graphics and ambience. Decent voice acting. Hilariously sub par naming of bosses ( lol )It is a tower defense game but less defense and more shmup imho. You can't defeat the levels with just towers alone, you must make use of the alien fighter and all of its abilities. Later game, I found myself favoring the laser and anti air, your experience may deviate/vary.I enjoyed almost every aspect of this game including the voice acting and the graphic design of the levels, enemies, terrain, bosses. The only thing I found laughable was the naming of some of the bosses, some are quite hilarious, I haven't yet decided if that is a funny quality that added to the quirkiness of the game or just a very miniscule annoyance.I also enjoyed the difficulty and learning curve (which there isn't much of, it is fairly simple to grasp). Word of advice, always always always take the time to scoop up every resource you can, it really makes a difference if you slack off in resource gathering. As I said, you can not defeat the levels with towers alone (almost can later on when you're fully upgraded but not quite) but in that same regard, you can't just use the fighter and its abilities to defeat levels either, you're going to need those towers which means you're going to need all of those resources.Again, had a blast with this game, it was worth the wait and the fair price.

I think if I could save between waves that would fix the problem but the waves are long and you have to complete 5+.  I think the upgrade system is interesting (you choose where to put your upgrade points each mission so you can change it around if you want)  Greaphics are nice and controls are not to bad.   One minor complaint is I would like to see either an easier to see redical or a contant tracking line coming from the ship.  Probably plays better with a controler but with a mouse I have trouble telling where I'm aiming when things get busy.

I played it in SC1, SC2, Warcraft...you name it. This game has those exciting elements of classic tower defense--tower upgrades, strategic positioning, route manipulations, etc. On top of that, it has the scrolling shooter aspect where you control an alien aircraft with a bunch of upgrades and technologies. It requires lots of multitasking due to many objectives and various challenges. Some enemies are fast and mainly deals damage, while others are more of slow, yet, tanky types. Some are ground units that have to follow the manipulated path, while some units just fly. Even playing at a Normal difficulty, the difficulty level of this game progresses quite fast and maintains a moderate amount of excitement and challenge. New types of units are introduced just about every wave and stage, so it does not feel very repetitive.Plus, this game is just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥beautiful. Graphic is bueaitufuly rendered.

Can't expect anymore from this game, as my hands are very full when playing it, ie. very engaging game, esp. during a boss fight!!!I've finished most missions on gold (on Normal), and some achievements require co-op with another person with a controller (i'm using keyboard + mouse).  But I can't say that's a negative, as it's something else for 2-players to have fun.  No multiplayer yet, I think that's good, as the dev focusses on single player, rather than connectivity & other overheads.The last few levels are like short Transformers movies and you gotta perservere!!! :DA big plus is that most TDs want you to grind so you can come back to achieve gold, but this can be done with skill.

76561197984173791,Not Recommended,408410,34904312,Posted: 12 September,all,captainthrall,"X-morph is a hybrid TD/space-shooter hybrid.  Remember the old Atari game Space Invaders?  It's basically the same type of gameplay.  Waves of enemys approach, and you shoot projectiles at them to defend  your base.The graphics are fun.  The maps are interactive with destructable bridges and buildings etc.  The physics look great for a small-budget game, and overall it has a nice feel.Unfortunately, it's not polished.  In the 3 hours of game play that I've accumulated, I've encountered two game-ending crashes, and at least one brick wall on the campaign progression.  The crashes are pretty self-explanitory.  I was playing the campaign mode, when suddenly the game closed itself and a debug report appeared on my screen.  While those incidents are annoying, I'm confident the developer team will eventually fix them.  The brick wall occured when I played the ""Germany"" phase of the campaign (I think it's the third level).  Each time a player starts a new phase, he/she chooses some specific tech upgrades and tower types.  For the first time, I had the option to choose a fire tower, so naturally I chose that because it seemed like it would be fun to try something new.  Unfortunately, progressing through the Germany phase requires air towers and by choosing fire, I had to disable air - which meant the phase became literally impossible.  No, it's not a ""get good noob"" type of situation, it's just simply impossible to defeat that phase if a player chooses fire towers rather than air towers.  This is a broken brick wall that should have been addressed prior to the game's release.  The point is, that the game is kind of sloppy.X-morph has a few other problems as well.  The foremost is the reliance on the space-invaders gameplay.  As a TD, you might expect that the towers you build will do the majority of bad-guy killing work. However, that's not the case.  On most stages, it feels like the towers are secondary, and the player-controlled builder kills the majority of the invaders.  It feels like the tower building is secondary to the player-controlled blasting.  Ultimately, the towers didn't really even matter because I was killing everyting with my ship anyway.  Furthermore, progression in the campaign mode is slow.  The tech is awarded at a turtle pace.  You'll be clearing 6+ mini-levels before you get a new shooting weapon or tower type.  I'm only 3 hours in, and I'm already bored.Overall, with the gameplay relying so heavily on point-and-click spaceship shooting, I can't recommend X-morph.  Hopefully, after they fix the bugs and crashes, they developers will tweak the game to make it more of a TD and less of a shooter... but until that happens, I can't really recommend X-morph."

Needing to shift/rebuild your defenses every round gets old very quickly, especially with every non-basic tower needing to be built as a basic tower first. You can move them, but I found myself spending half my time ferrying towers back and forth between rounds.I wouldn't call it a bad game.

After the first two missions, its possible to just place towers and not have to fire a single shot.This game is fun, visually stunning, makes sense for once and doesnt seem repetative.However, for how much content that there is in the game and how little there is to make you want to play it again, i feel that the price is a little steep, even when on sale.IMO, the game sould be 9.99 and no more. I simply dont think that its worth it. The same can and has been said for Ashes of the singularity, its a ""Good game"" With stunny visuals and good machanics but it is also way over priced.So, yes, i will be recommending this game but i will erge people to get it on sale if they can, i simply cannot recommend it at the asking price."
,Recommended,408410,34705917,Posted: 3 September,all,{*PsYcHo*} Derodric,"I've been keeping track of this game since a post I saw on Imgur back in June of 2017. I was pretty excited to hear that it was finally releaed, but a bit skeptical (I hoped that it wasn't all just hype). For under $20 though I thought it was worth the risk. After having spent several hours in the game and messing around, I can definitely say I really enjoy the game.Some features I really like:- To keep the game from getting repetetive, each map has a slightly different play style and focus with a variety of enemies that don't show up on every map.- Game has multiple difficulties (I've only done normal so far), but found that to be adequately difficult. I am not sure I could succeed on higher difficulties without really careful planning.- A good balance of number of enemies vs. health of each unit.- The amazing physics and graphics (Never had low framerate despite all the particles on the screen).- The overall complete feeling of the game. It feels like an entire game, and I've seen less charged for more. I've only encountered one minor bug where I couldn't access a single tower, but besides that, the game runs smoothly.- The ability to place, remove, move, upgrade, and downgrade towers without punishment. Every wave you can destroy all of your towers and set them back up in any way you want. Placing a tower costs 1 resource point, and removing it returns 1 point. Upgrading and downgrading is the same way, and moving is free. Great system for all of us perfectionists.The story is pretty much just an excuse to blow stuff up. It has a Pacific Rim sort of vibe of ""We shall build giant death robots and to hell with city infastructure!"" Can be cheesy at times, but at its core, it's a tower defence, not Mass Effect, and I rather enjoy it; It suits the game.Tl:Dr - Great game worth every dollar if you enjoy real-time, destructible environments that you can destroy in any way you see fit, strategic tower defense games, supporting well-made indie games, or any combination of those three."

I've had no major issues/glitches running the game.I've seen lots of this was an easy or hard game. On the normal difficulty setting, I'd say for the average gamer this is going to be challenging and take some strategizing to win some levels. For those of you who have played Sanctum or Grid Defense this game will feel right at home. This is kind of like a hybrid of those two games. Figuring out how to use your weapons and utilize your charge ability to its best is a must. If you get stuck on a level just think about what you aren't doing or take a break and come back to it. Odds are you need to move/change your towers around more inbetween rounds. You're playing a strategy game, use your noggin to win. Co-op in this game is so much fun. I wish it was online with friends but communication would be an issue. Boss battles are just brilliant. I can't get enough of them.

You mean just as much as your towers with this game, and it is actually quite difficult and strategic.  I'm just now on the last mission for single player (yet to play co-op but i can't wait until I do), and i've had plenty of wave losses that made me re-evalutate turret placement, wall placements and which turrets to use along with which turrets need defense agaisnt mortars/bombers/etc.  It's a lot of fun and if you're at all into tower defense games, please give it a try! Well worth the money."

,Recommended,408410,34867841,Posted: 10 September,all,tearfromthered,An excellent mix between shoot them up and tower defense.The game design is so great is seems like that fusion was an obvious thing to do.Great visual design and stunning graphics. And you get to play the bad guys invading earth for once.There is a very big solo campaign that's interesting but a bit repetitive.
