The puzzles are not hard, but simply the act of solving them in VR was a fun and memorable experience. The environments that surround you (along with the interactions), are mind blowing.I look forward to what Charm Games comes out with in the future!"
,Recommended,408520,34396426,Posted: 21 August,all,JazzGitti,"Wow. After I'd finished the game, I sat on my floor watching the credits, thinking: ""These kind of experiences are why I got into VR."" The game is highly polished and a great benchmark of what a puzzle game should be like in VR."
,Recommended,408520,32118196,Posted: 1 June,all,ZiXT,"Very much a 'VR ""The Room"" Lite'. If you enjoy Manipulating levers and other objects to solve spatial puzzles, you'll likely enjoy FORM.Interesting concept.  Well designed (audio, visuals, and game progression).Some of the puzzles were a bit low for me (6'2"") and a literal pain in the neck to look at too long, but no there was no VR-related discomfort.I recommend the game, though the price is steep for the length. Bought at 16.49CDN. 50 minutes to complete including the credits."

Others may take a little longer, but I can't imagine it would take more than 1.5  to 2 hrs.Having said that: WOW!!!!It just kept stunning me with twisted lanscapes and machinery, like the sacred geometry of an alien mind.  Puzzles felt mysteriously intuitive, despite having to do some really weird stuff to solve some of them.  There was only really one puzzle that I didn't care for, but it wasn't awful or anything, just not as outlandish and creative as the others.Sound design and score is powerful, chilling stuff, really selling the whole sacred alien revelation thing.  It really felt like the trippiest moments of Contact or Close Encounters.Lastly, great use of VR!  Lots of intuitive grabbing, pullling, switching, aiming, peeking... none of this would have worked in a traditional game.  It avoids locomotion problems by having puzzles evolve around you, keeping everything in roomscale reach.  Some scripted teleportation occurs, but it all makes sense within the narrative.I think this might be my favourite VR title so far this year.  Honestly, my only regret is that there isn't more of it.  I actually wish it ended on a cliffhanger, promising more chapters coming soon!  I would buy them in a heartbeat.  For now, I will be playing this through again just for the WOW factor, and will definitely be demoing to friends and family.Big thanks to the devs, truly awesome work!"

Add to that there's no replayability. The asking price of 19,99€ is relly really steep, but I have to say the experience was really great. If you have a lot of money then I say go for it otherwise wait for a sale.The puzzles were very easy but satisfying. This may be a puzzle game, but that's not what you pay for. It's all about the experience of being in a surrealistic mind dimension. The atmosphere is nothing short of amazing.It's the perfect game to introduce people to VR."

I found I was pleasantly surprised, what I remember to be most striking was how much care and effort went in to have this game so well polished.The puzzle side of things were a bit easy, but that is a tricky thing to get right (and right for who?). I would rather slightly too easy than the opposite IMO, no frustration! The length (common VR theme!) is short. Without rushing or being a genius, I finished this in an hour or so, incl the credits. Other than the length, the game did cheap out a bit in the middle during a story clip, it was told to a static backdrop. But considering the time and effort to do things well in VR, I think it was the right decision, rather than make the game shorter (assuming it was a budget call).If you havent played Simon, or done a jigsaw puzzle in years - like a normal person - then maybe its retro enough for you to enjoy it again, briefly.FORM is a beautifully and lovingly crafted puzzle game. While short (about 1hr), at a discount is a worthwhile purchase."

I can’t even drink £11.24 worth of beer in an hour, so certainly not value for money even though…..The graphics are truly wonderfulThe sound and music fits wellThere is a story, but no history or lore, so you wonder what its all aboutThe puzzles are interesting, with very clever mechanics, graphics and with motion controller input, but the puzzles are not very challengingIt’s standing only (no room movement required) as described (just though I would repeat this)You probably won’t play this again, although it’s worth showing off to your friends.If you have the cash, take the splash, if not, best let it rot"

The price is a little on the steep side for only about 1 hour of play but it is just too good to not recommend and hopfully more content is coming.Even though it is short I really hope many people get this game and support the devs because we need more great experiences like this in VR if we want VR to grow.Cant recomend this game enough 10/10
,Recommended,408520,34504350,Posted: 26 August,all,Jon,"TLDR: +looks great +transfers you to really different place +all unique puzles +kinda trippy experince-lenght ~+-hand alignmentOk, it was short. But I have to admit, it was some quality time. It's good that there was few warning reviews about shortness.This game has many great ideas that would be great to see in other games aswell. Loved the looking sphere idea. Great movement (what little there was) from one spot to another with those light trails. Just the right amoung of surreal scenery.Something that doen't get used enough in vr (what I've seen) is 2d - 3d portal use. That some mere flat door frame holds whole scenery behind it. Actuallu that could have been used more here too.I see it would've been easy to extend this game by repeating same type of puzles over and over. Now it felt more unique without and unnecessary grinding. Once one problem was solved there wasnt any need to repeat same thing all over in different form.Something that broke some of the experiance was hand alignment. It felt strange to grab and operate with palms and not with fingertips. Though I got high hopes if this gets knuckles update some day. Had couple small tracking losts but nothing that breaks the game. Just annoying reminder that reality still exists outside.This works great as a sequel to gallery: the call of the starseed. Couple tweaks plot wise and woul've fooled me.Still, awesome experience"

,Not Recommended,408520,34698553,Posted: 2 September,all,Tiran Kenja,While this is a very well made game. I cannot recommend paying this sort of money for a 1 hour experience with no real replayability.Graphics and general presentation was some of the best I have seen. But there is not exactly a lot of story and neighter are the puzzles much of a challenge.

,Not Recommended,408520,32773393,Posted: 25 June,all,[a2m]Androktasie,"I really want to like this game.  The graphics and sound are mighty impressive, and you can tell that a lot of effort went into making it.  If you can take the last bits of 2001: A Space Oddyssey and flesh it out, or view some of the more brilliant examples of the Demoscene (espcially ASD), that's basically the atmosphere of FORM.But as for the gameplay and story, I was left wanting.  I'm guessing it's mostly the lack of exploration; there's no movement in the game except for popping between set pieces after accomplishing a series of easy puzzles.  This lack of exploraiton and lack of challenge felt... childish?  Literally square peg goes into square hole, play 4-color Simon, that sort of thing.  For as mind-bending graphics as the game has, I came in expecting something puzzles more non-euclidian like Antichamber, or something as challenging / exploratory as Talos Principle-- both games that a recent Reddit thread linked the game to.  Sadly FORM does not live up to those for gameplay."
76561198016826683,Recommended,408520,32167875,Posted: 3 June,all,Puhtahtoe,One of the most beautiful VR games I've played yet. The animations felt organic and the scenery was delightfully abstract. The puzzles were intuitive and enjoyable with a good amount of variation.My one complaint is the length of the game. Just as I felt like things were really getting started it ended.
,Recommended,408520,32164488,Posted: 3 June,all,mariemariemusic,"Exceptional! This is a beautiful game, with amazing sound design. I was really caught off guard and wasn't expecting something as polished as this is. Right from the beginning, I knew the developers were not hacks. I was a little confused as to what was going on and what I was supposed to do, but once I got through the intro bit, it's clear as day. Everything before me was a puzzle, and they are unique. A lot of puzzle games have one mechanic that just becomes more complicated as time progresses. This is not the case wih FORM. I will say that the puzzles aren't that hard, but being completely stumped for an hour on one puzzle in VR is not an ideal experience, so I was happy to progress without pulling all of my hair out.I completed the game in about an hour, and I am sure lots of people will complain that it is too short for the purchase price. Everyone has their own threshold for what they can pay, but in my eyes, the $15 was well worth it. This is by far one of the best puzzle games available in VR.One final note, the video trailer for this game just doesn't do it justice. In fact, there is no way for a trailer to help you understand what you will experiece. You will just have to jump in.It is a solid VR experience that will WOW you and your friends."

,Recommended,408520,32139401,Posted: 2 June,all,Riddla,"FORM does a thing I've only seen partially achieved by artist Isaac Cohen in his VR experiments (LUNE and Blarp! and My 'lil Donut) and that's create objects that cannot possibly exist in our reality and gives them a form.Beautifully crafted puzzles that are fairly simple to get through if you apply some logic, but leave you filled with wonderment at the shapes materialising before you.It's very easy to become disassociated with space when you're standing on an infinitely high column above an infinitely high abyss while an even more infinitely large pyramid burns with fire in front of you. The sense of presence is wonderful as the sound design is for the most part good too, despite some... stilted voice acting - but don't get me wrong - the fact that they went to the trouble to record lines for a game in such a small market as VR shows they're willing to put the effort in to make a game as good as it can be and not just half♥♥♥♥♥measures.Though could possibly do with a hard mode next devs... ;)Innovative and beautiful, with plenty of varied scene changes and different interactions to figure out the puzzles with. A very good buy for the price."

Nothing else quite like it or at this level of quality on the Vive at the time of review.  Amazing visuals - fun puzzles - intriguing storyline (albeit not really too important to the mission at hand).  Its genuinely something you've got to try.  At this time beyond the main game there is a really cool ""interactive soundtrack"" style area called the Cortex where by flicking a button you can toy around with sounds/colours in a series of environments.The only downside to it is its over too fast.  Just over an hour was enough time for me to soak in all the visuals and complete all the puzzles.  Was hoping for a more definitive ending after all that, but if its leaving way for a sequel or DLC i'm all game.  Still due to its length i'd really recommend getting this on sale if possible.  As many others have said similar puzzle experience to The Room, but the environments in FORM are truly something you've got to see firsthand in VR to truly appreciate.  Definitely a keeper just so I can let others playthrough :)"

It gets a lot out of the spatial puzzle gimmick and doesn't overstay its welcome.Some of those puzzles can be tripped up or made a bit more difficult by how your VR room is setup, but it works incredibly well overall and makes great use of the medium."

This is the sort of game VR works best with in my opinion; slow, methodical, MYST-like puzzles. FORM is absolutely breathtakingly beautiful, with awe-inspiring alien landscapes and formidable music. The puzzles are a good mix of linear-self-explanatory, exploration-puzzling and trial-and-error.The one problem is that this game is way, way too short. I was definitely left wanting; I'd like a game like this but with 20, 50 or 100 hours of gameplay.As it is, this game is simply a testament to what can be done. See it as a demo. Of the future."

,Recommended,408520,32166657,Posted: 3 June,all,wonderbreadvr,"Let's get the honesty out of the way first. Yes, this is a short game. A very short game in fact. Maybe an hour playthough if you take your time. But... it was an amazing hour! It feels like you have entered an alien mothership, and you're attempting to communicate with its primary entity through logic puzzles and sound. A test of human understanding. Absolutely wonderful.PROS -- The sound design in this game is phenomenal! So many VR games lack quality sound design, but not this one. This one sounds like you are standing in a futuristic cavern. Every completion is met with a satisfying BWAH!- Graphics are top quality. The design asthetic is meant to be futuristic, and I agree with all the choices made in terms of style and look.- You can tell that the development team put love into this title, This game is POLISHED.- Gameplay is surprisingly intuitive, and not glitchy at all. I experienced no dropped frames, no jutter, nothing. Despite the awesomeness of what was happening around me, it still ran wonderfully. And I'm only rocking an AMD Fx8350 and a GTX 1070.- Have your family try it to add replay value. I can't imagine anyone over the age of fourty not being completely blown away.CONS -- Duration. However, I would rather enjoy a rock solid hour of awesome, instead of sit through six hours of crap.- Price. Although I do think the price is justified due to the amount of time the developers have obviously put into their product, I think full price would have been a little too much (I got it on sale). Still worth it though.- The puzzle were pretty easy. Yes, I figured out all the puzzles in an hour, but the way the puzzles work and fit together is fantastic. It all feels interconnected.I would certainly recommend this game if you want a smooth, beautiful, sci-fi experience. Good stuff.9/10"

I really wonder if the dev team played Loom because there are some very clear references.Form is a great experience and I played it through in one go because I did not want to stop. It took me 99 minutes, but you may do it quicker. I paid around the price of a cinema ticket so although some call this game short, for me it was worth the admission price easily.The unique soundtrack was very cool, but I admit wondering how cool it would have been with a Vangelis soundtrack - you get the idea anyway, very cool audio experience to go with a superb visual experience.It was one of those games that I took a seat and sat through the end credits, 'cause it felt like the right thing to do.GGz Dev team, congrats on a great FR experience."

The designs and environments whilst abstract and slightly 'oppressive' (for the lack of words for describing some higher dimensional geometrically inclined fever dream!) offer some genuinely creative moments of VR puzzling. I really must admire the care given to the experience, including the sense of progression and empowerment (particularly in the 'right' chamber) through the puzzles.My only critiques would be that to those who are puzzle-savvy, it is possibly a little high on the price side for the time taken to complete the experience. My other critique is I was certainly yearning for more gameplay after completing it!

This was truly an captivating and awe inspiring experience.  Definitely one of my favorite VR titles.  It was short, but worth it.  I cant wait for more."

The contraption sound effects and puzzles (while not hard) are really captivating and intriguing. Once you start, you'll finish it and you will want more."

The puzzles are not that difficult but add to the overall ambience of the game making it a must play. Pick it up, you most likely won't be disappointed."

The puzzles were fun and just hard enough to pose a challenge but easy enough to figure out without a guide.  Awesome sounds, visuals, and great use of motion controls.  A must-have game for Vive owners."

I *definitely* wouldn't mind if the conclusion felt more... conclusion-y, but I knew about the game's length, and bought it anyways- and it was *totally* worth it.The visuals in this game are nothing short of breathtaking (*really* captures that 'first human trapped in an alien puzzle cube' feel!), and the puzzles are among the most fun I've played with in VR yet.Some may balk at the price per hour of gameplay being offered here, but I'm telling you- this game is a like a fancy, high end firework show- it burns hard and fast, but every moment is unique in a way I haven't seen done in any other VR experience I've tried (and I've tried a *lot*)"
76561198015615503,Recommended,408520,34635839,Posted: 31 August,all,[BB]Grizzley1978,"I wasn’t sure what to expect from this game.  I know it was a puzzle game, and so far, am impressed with it.  If you ever have played ‘The Room’ series, it feels a lot like that.  For VR, this type of gameplay where you need to grab onto things to solve the puzzle is what VR is all about.  I had some connection hiccups when trying to grab objects at a certain level, but that is due to how my sensors are setup and not the game itself.Gameplay:  So far I’ve just scratched the surface of the game, but I find, just like a movie or novel, if it doesn’t grab your attention within the first few chapters or minutes generally the outcome is bleak.The overall concept is beautiful and I look forward to play this more in the upcoming days.Price point is spot on.  Purchased it when it was on sale, but even at full price the game is worth it.If you like puzzles and enjoyed ‘The Room’ series you should enjoy this game."

I love how you interact with the different machines by pulling levers, pushing buttons, rotating objects, etc. The puzzles are not too difficult and the design reminds of the IOS title ""the room"".I completed the game in exactly one hour. Looking forward to a sequel!"

It's fairly short at only about an hour but I thought this was the right length for this style of game and with the 40% discount, which brought it down to about $10, I thought it was well worth the price. This is definitely something I will show to friends who are new to VR so they can see its potential for interactive storytelling. I'm sure I will return to this fantastic title at a later date when I have a much higher resolution headset than the Vive so I can full appreciate its beauty.Thank you very much to the developers at Charm Games for allowing me the opportunity to step into your imaginations and I look forward to whatever you produce next."

Whole experience is just over an hour (maybe two if you take your time with the puzzles) so may be hard to justify paying full price.  No movement / locomotion involved - motion sickness should not be an issue at all."
