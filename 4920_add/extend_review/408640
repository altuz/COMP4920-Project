Actually it's one of the better ports I've had the pleasure of playing recently.  The game runs fine, a solid 60 fps.  I've had no issues with the netcode, online seems decent.  Max resolution may be 720p but the game still looks great, I'm not even that turned off by the overly pixelated sprites that obviously weren't originally designed to be viewed at anything above the 3DS' 800x240 top screen.  In fact they're kinda giving me a Saturn vibe which is a plus.I do however, as horrible as it is to admit, hope they can get the English Dub from Atlus and patch it into this PC release.  This was one case that I would actually leave the English VO's on, they did a fantastic job localizing Code of Princess in that regard."

I bought this for co-op, but you can't play new levels with a friend, you have to solo them your first time through.You can select the stat you want to level up. If you dump everything into attack prepare to breeze through 80% of the game no sweat, only to be destroyed in the last portion.Despite maxing out my attack, I was doing almost no damage for the last chapters. It felt like my attack stat rolled over back to zero--it didn't but I was certain it had before testing it. I was reduced to a glass canon that couldn't even fire.You'll also only level up the character you play as, inhibiting you from trying out the other characters you unlock.A lot of budget went into hiring their talented character artist and the high quality opening animation. There's were even statues made and sold for this game!http://myfigurecollection.net/item/60795Unfortunately, a large remainder of the game suffers from not being polished enough.

It caused a friend of mine to disconnect anywhere from a few minutes to an hour or so in to a story run.An entertaining little Beat 'Em Up/RPG hybrid with an extremely large roster of playable characters. There are just four in the campaign mode, but it would appear that ANY character in the game is playble in free play, including, funnily enough, incidental nameless NPCs. Given that individual levels are quite short, consisting of just a few enemies and/or a single boss, there a lot of levels in total, including many bonus levels that are as one might expect, much harder then the campaign. In combat, you can whail on enemies using light or heavy attacks, and the main characters at least have a small set of special attacks that are activated with 2D-Fighter-style directional inputs. There is a large amount of equippable gear items to find, overall making the game similar to other Japanese games like Earth Defense Force or Samurai Warriors, where the design philosphy seems to be to squeeze the maximum amount of gameplay out of a set number of assets. Wether this is good game design or not is up to the player. I've enjoyed many games of this type, including the afforementioned ones as well as Naval Ops: Commander and the english version of Shin Combat Choro Q, called Seek And Destroy in the US. The music and in-game voice lines of Code of Princess are a tad repeitive, as the characters make the same callouts every time they use even basic attacks, but the English subtitles are hilarious and very self-aware, and worth reading. Looking forward to trying the coop mode."

It tells you in the tutorial to play free mode to level your characters if you get stuck, but I finished the game in one sitting without ever having to do this, mostly by button-mashing my way through the fights.

The depth of character growth means that every point spent in leveling up actually stays with the character and th equipment actually changes how their stats are too. Pretty nice. The game is a port of a Nintendo DS title, so all the graphics are comparitive. Except certain things did get a fresh coat of paint. If only the whole game got a good graphics overhaul or remaster for a PC release. There should be no reason a decent computer should fall below 120FPS on this.

,Not Recommended,408640,22604620,"Posted: 24 April, 2016",all,Chernobog,"As someone who grew up in the age of the side scrolling brawlers like Streets of Rage, 42nd Street, and Final Fight, I expected more out of Code of Princess. It's a game that's similar to those in concept, but plays in a much clunkier fashion. Apparently, it's a spiritual successor to Guardian Heroes, which unfortunately I've never heard of outside of the name, but as an old school brawler fan, Code of Princess really doesn't scratch the itch.You can pick from a growing cast of several characters throughout the main story or basically any monster during online coop and versus play. That's pretty cool and they all control differently. However, they're not really balanced amongst each other and some have movesets that are just regrettable, such as double tapping in one direction does not cause all characters to run, but instead they might make a slow skipping motion. Combos and move sets aren't terribly difficult fortunately, but here's where the game snags.The combat is just not that good. It's grindy, incredibly slow, and not particularly exciting, beyond near every character's ability to smack a mook across the playing field. forcing you to constantly chase them down. You can increase your stats, but the changes are numerical only in nature and not always easy to perceive as an improvement. Your character can jump up and down 'lanes', instead of simply walking them, with the flick of a button. This adds some minor tactical value, but I found it rarely mattered beyond temporarily avoiding large groups. Why not simply allow the player to just walk there? It feels unnecessarily clunky without adding that much. Other things you cannot do compared to old school brawlers: grapple enemies, make use of dropped weapons (there's occasionally bombs which can hurt anyone), or make much use of the fighting screen. The lanes are mainly identical beyond static destructible obstacles and cosmetic backgrounds, so don't expect a Double Dragon or River City Ransom approach either. This is firmly within it's own category of brawler, for better or worse. There really isn't a lot of skill to be used, even for a brawler style game. Get xp, spend your points, mash the buttons, and that's about it.Music is alright, if unremarkable. Voices are all in japanese and follow the usual stereotypes. Sounds are similarly fair, but nothing to write home about. Graphically, the game is reasonably nice, although the screen is bordered and the characters are heavily pixelized. Because they're so close to the viewer, they look a bit blurry and unflattering at times. Animated sequences are admittedly good and befitting basic low budget animes.Unfortunately, the story and the characters are entirely uninteresting shallow tropes. The heroes and villains are visually stylized but have one note personalities that can usually be summarized in a three word sentence fragment. The story isn't anything new or clever, nor is the dialogue which borders on incredibly lame, but is fortunately quite skippable. There is a somewhat interesting background to some of the fights, where the BBEG assaults towns with monsters, only to save them using the BBEG's own evil army, but it doesn't amount to much.Concening the Co-op and versus mode, well, it's largely empty of anyone. Few to none seem to play it, so you might need to wrangle some dedicated friends together for that.At the end of the day, Code of Princess is basically a mindless button masher with generic anime tropes to compose a slapped together reason to fight the bad guys. It feels weak for a modern title. If you wanna get your inner weeaboo out and you like monotonous combat, CoP might be for you. Otherwise, I'd recommend passing on this."

Hack and Slash with RPG elements thrown in to keep the gameplay interesting and fresh.  Also there's a good amount of items and equipment to horde so looters will have a blast.  It's a perfect model of Guardian Heros on the Sega Saturn with individual character levels based on their use, the ability to jump from the middle lane to the back or front as well was first implemented by Guardian Heroes to great effect in this game as well to get the jump on other lane attackers.  There's special moves, combos, stat buffs and equipment that enhances your character as well.  Also as mentioned, you get two ability points after finishing a quest so you can pad your weaker stats with those points or buff out your larger stats if you feel so inclined.All in all it's a mix of Guardian Heroes and Castle Crashers with more GH than CC but both clearly played a hand in influencing this game as well as titles like Final Fight, Double Dragon and the list goes on and on.Graphics: 9Gameplay: 10Relative ease of learning the game from tutorial: 10Story: 9Replayability: 9, plus I didn't mention before there are four other characters to unlock to play with as well!Overall, I'd buy this if you're looking for a solid hack n' slash with RPG elements thrown in.

,Recommended,408640,27696642,"Posted: 26 November, 2016",all,paralistalon,"This isn't the best game I've played on Steam, but I'm giving it a thumbs up because it delivers on what it promises.  The 2D beat-em-up gameplay is quick to pick up, and chaining together combos on-the-fly to slice and dice the monsters to bits is quite satisfying.  You can switch between the main characters, but you'll have to level them all from lv.1, which can be annoying but also extends the gameplay time and gives you that sense of RPG grindy goodness of watching your character go from weakling to instrument of mass destruction.  I wish there were more moves for each character or that you could unlock a couple of upgrades, but you can still come up with enough variations of the basic moveset to stay entertained for a while.  The animations are okay, but the characters do look a bit pixelated from the transition from DS game to PC full-screen.  My biggest complaint is the story.  It's your standard generic comedy JRPG fare that really only exists to string together a series of self-referrential jokes.  The princess begins her journey by traveling through the countryside trying to evade the incompetent bad guys who want to capture her and her giant magic sword.  She tries to hide from the bad guys by using the subtle tactic of walking around in broad daylight wearing her royal outfit complete with crown while hoisting her massive sword around wherever she goes.  The battle stages themselves sadly only last about 1-2 minutes each, and then you get another cutscene (which you can thankfully speed along by holding C)."

If you liked that game, you'll like Code of Princess too. The action never gets quite as crazy as Guardian Heroes sometimes did. There aren't quite as many enemies on the screen at one time. However, if you liked the goofiness of the magic system in GH, it works almost identically here. For example, hitting someone with the giant laser beam spell is somehow contagious and spreads to people around them, even yourself.Take away the branching story line, but add silly humor and equipment, and you've got Code of Princess. It's not a whole lot of dough, so just buy it and have some fun."

For 5-8 bucks, get it if you like what you see, but I wouldn't be able to justify paying more than that. The four playable characters have maybe 3 different moves and or combos. There is not much to see here. You go to a 1 to 5 minute level, have a very well told story, use your three combos to mow down about 10-30 opponents and then maybe a boss depending on the level at hand and then get a lil chunk of story, level up your character (everything but Vitality and Attack is a waste of time) and then maybe change the equipment on your character, tho what is sold buy the vendor always seems to be awful junk.The main character ingame models look hidious, while all the monsters are really nice looking, so I dont get why they decided to do this. Not enough space on the 3DS cartridge? Laughable. At least change it for the pc version then. At some points I felt like the game design to be done by mindless monkey zombies while other parts are really cool.

It now runs at 60 fps, has some graphic options, a really nice layout choice (allowing you to show two screens like on a 3ds) that you can switch on the spot without any performance impact, and with good control options from the start. It suffers from the 3DS assets and resolution, but it's not a remake, so the best choice for those that can't stand those graphics is probably to run it in windowed mode.Now the game itself is a decent beat them all similar to Guardian Heroes (line switch, equipment, stages with a story, etc) with a light rpg component (experience, stats, equipment) and a good replayability.Its main problem is that its main character is actually the most boring to play. Progress a bit further in the story and you'll unlock characters being fast, having nice basic combos, etc.Overall, I'd say that the game is good for its price, with a fun story, competent voice acting and music, good 2D character art with poor ""sprites"" and a nice little beat them up.

The audio is 3Ds quality, the graphics are 3DS quality and the anime character  designs is lazy, including the cutscenes that were developed by japanese animation Studio Bones, very famous with anime fans.On the good part the characters ar e fully japanese voiced in many ways. so thats a good thing.The combat system is repetitive but pretty good, you could use combos and it has a full RPG system so you could create your characters as you wish, for example a bard full of speed or a necromancer full of attack, the world it's yours to go crazy.Also it features like 50 characters to play with on the freeplay, which is pretty neat.

There are four different characters for the campaign (but, puzzlingly, some 7 characters who are in your group of heroes) and tons of characters can be unlocked for co-op or versus mode (even gag characters like an old man). Once you get the hang of the bursting and plane mechanics, it becomes about playing fast and smart to avoid getting stunlocked while doing tons of damage to your enemies.If I had a complaint, it would be that the Japanese voiceovers (no English dub option for this port) really don't seem to match up with the text translation. The game's online search also didn't net me any multiplayer sessions during primetime hours (8PM to 11PM EST) despite the game only having been released a few days prior to my review. The campaign took me only about 6 hours to finish with only one or two levels really giving me any trouble. There are plenty of bonus levels, though, and the game definitely seems like it would be fun in online play, which includes co-op and versus modes (including a ranked mode).Despite my complaints, the port is really well done. There are different display options that are either one large, arcade-style screen or a split-screen DS-style option that show the top and bottom screens with some graphics along the borders to fill the gaps. The game never drops any frames even when there are a lot of effects being used on-screen (and, depending on your character, there can be a LOT of effects).If you're looking for a fun and old-fashioned action game, Code of Princess is for you.

Hand drawn graphics, with the charecters being done in detailed pixel art against a higher res but still 2d background looks nice, the animations esp of the player is smooth.At its core Code of Princess is a beat em up, with light rpg and collectable elements. Your charecters have a mana bar and with simple button taps different special moves can be executed. You also fight on ""planes"" Just like in Guardian Heroes, and holding block while tapping up or down will quickly  let you shift to a new plane. There are items and stats you can increase to grow your fighter.  The collectable element comes in similar to guardian hero's as in the further you go, the more charecters you unlock. You can unlock ""Main"" charecters which are involved in the storymode and you can use for campaign levels. You can also unlock the grunt charecters to fight in an arena type deal. Charecters have thier own special movesets but since its based off a simple control set its easy to pick up and play.The only drawbacks are the levels themselves are repetative, and bland, this is made up for by the fun fights.

The B button is fast attack, and you have to either press it by itself, or hold up in order to do quick attacks. There's down, down, attack and the ryu fireball specials. The A button is strong attack.After a while, you do need strategy in order to not be overwhelmed from both sides."

I’m going to be looking at Code of Princess. You know when the fan service is this blatant you know this calls in some racy jokes. From now on whenever I reference this game rather than saying the title I am going to think of other possible titles this game could have gone by.StoryThe story in Code of Victoria’s secret model is that humans and monster lived in peace until one day the kingdom of Delux gets attacked by a neighboring kingdom who used monsters has there mean to attack. Before the kingdom was over thrown though the king told Princess Solange to retrieve the sword Deluxexlbur and when she does it explodes allowing her to meet a thief named Ali. Together the two among with a band of other misfits only half of them are playable in the story go on a journey to figure out what’s going on.While Code of Double D’s  is known to be a Guardian Hero’s knock off the story is linear while in Guardiean Hero’s there was a choose your own path and story which is miss her. The good news is that the game, just like it’s main protagonist clothing selection never takes itself too seriously there are jokes everywhere from whenever someone remakes Solnge isn’t wearing much to have her saying it’s a fashionable dress, or its formal wear. Yeah next time a girlfriend tells me she needs me to help find her a formal dress I’ll head to the lingerie store immeadily. (put up just kidding I don’t have a death wish).GameplayThe gameplay in code of Upton here should be familiar if you ever played an old Sega game called Guardian Heroes because at it’s core it’s the same game with a few more light RPG elements sprinkled on it. It’s a brawler the idea is to beat up enemies and monsters enough to finish area and progress the story along. It’s not quite like an old arcade brawler has the areas aren’t huge by any means and rarely do you have to beat up a bunch of enemies to progress to the next screen;  but to the next story segment. Has stages are really short taking only a few minutes each to beat.Next to beating people up with combos your character’s have a special magic attack, plus a burst option which doubles there stats but drains there magic. And like I said Guradiean heroes the battles happen on battlefields with 2 or 3 planes that can be jump too easily if you get crowded and the fact that you have large enemies on screen all the time means you do get crowded.. Each character for the most part does feel different, with Solange there being the heaviest character (put up no Pun intended). With Ali being the fastest and so on.Has for the RPG elements there forgettable you can equip stuff that has some nice effects but leveling up does little to nothing has you rise your stats you rarely feel more powerful for doing this. It dosen’t really feel that needed in the game .Has for extra modes you have a free play mode and you also have extra missions where you can play has every character in the game , and I do mean every character. Your 4 main leads, those side character’s you run into but are non playable, monsters, and even villiagers are selctable and upgradable in these extra missions. It’s a nice bit of distraction once you get past the story and some of them can be quite tough even if you manage to purchase good gear for you charecters.All in all I felt the gameplay in code of milk bags was a nice throw back to the old brawlers in the 90’s. But it’s not has good has the game that is playing homage to. It has a linear story with only 2 endings based on a choice you make after you beat the last boss. while Guradiean Heros may have been shorter had multiple paths and multiple endings. Still I had fun with the gameplay in this one despite some of the flaws in the gameplayGraphicsCode of extreme fan service suffers from the same graphical problems a lot of 3ds ports on steam suffer from. Low resolution textures making everything look blocky, especially if you play it in full screen. The shame of it is just Shantae and Azure Striker Gunvolt there was work done in the drawing of those sprites. The animation is good and the charecters and the way they are drawn are quite charming. It’s just too bad that all those blocks on the screen really wrecks havoc on the charm, so much hard work only to appear like a blocky mess.Sound.The music in the game is pretty good but unfortunately code of dirty pillows on steam only has a Japanese audio track. No English dub it doesn’t help get accorss the humor in this game when the character’s only speak Japanese, the 3ds version seem to have a pretty component English audio track what happen to have it not appear on steam it just seems well “naked” without it.Final Recommendation.I think 15 dollars is a bit too high for Code of Princess but if you can wait for it’s on sale for less than 10 dollars it might be worth checking out, especially if you are a fan of the classic game Guardian Heroes."
,Recommended,408640,22543941,"Posted: 20 April, 2016",all,pixelten,"A very rare breed of beat-em-up which features a multi-lane setup instead of a single plane. Just like Guardian Heroes and Panzer Bandit that came way before it, Code of Princess features intense action coupled with some very ridiculous character designs and art done by Kinu Nishimura of Street Fighter fame (odd that they couldn't incorporate her art style for the in-game dialogue portraits).Combat may feel quite floaty but you get used to it quickly enough. Controls are responsive (inputs are similar to how it's done in Smash Bros. or Tales games) but a controller is ABSOLUTELY recommended. Being a port from the 3DS, it's quite decent and you won't find yourself needing the dual-screen layout much if at all. Lots of unlockables in the form of characters and equipment. Stat building and equipment choices also offer a degree of customization and progression. The game really doesn't take itself seriously when it comes to story so don't expect anything deep (you really shouldn't if you've seen the character designs), Code of Princess feels like something straight out of the 90s Playstation era.It's a shame they couldn't redo the sprites for the port as having the 3D render sprites directly from the 3DS resolution upscaled to PC resolutions make it clash with the more smoother 3D environments.The major problems with the game come in its other design choices. While you can unlock pretty much EVERY character in the game as playable, only four can be used in the campaign. Three characters who actually join your party don't seem to show up in the campaign roster which is quite disappointing as they have really fun playstyles. You'll only be able to use the majority of unlocked characters in bonus quests and versus modes.The implmentation Co-op (which supports a maximum of 2-4 people) is also a very questionable one as you CANNOT run the full campaign in co-op with a friend, instead, your only option is to go through each quest one by one, ending co-op whenever a quest is done and then having to load up the next one manually. Take note of this is you plan to get this game to run the story with a friend.Replay value comes in the form of completing bonus quests and trying out every character and if you're up to it, maxing them all out to level 99. Some are definitely more harder to use than others (playing as one of the bosses versus an old man NPC). Your mileage may vary but Code of Princess is definitely worth a shot for anyone that likes action games, also, the shop theme may embed itself in your mind for quite some time."

The resolution doesn't even match, so there is always a border on the sides of the screen. Trying to figure out the controls is a pain, especially if  you are trying to use a gamepad instead of keyboard. The worst part is the gaming sprites. Why couldn't they at least add some anti-aliasing? The only thing I liked about the game is the story, which is a pretty typical JRPG story. If for whatever reason you'd want to play a game meant for a portable system, I recommend Final Fantasy Type-O. Square Enix puts a little more effort into their ports than Atlus did in this one."

You also unlock/buy items in the shop to up your stats, but you nearly always just put points into Attack and Mind for damage.If you don't rely on your stats to carry you, you can clear the game pretty quick (>2 hours if your good), you may even find there's more cut-scenes/dialogue than gameplay (you can fastforward by holding ""c"").If you're unsure whether the game is for you, I'd recommend waiting for a decent sale, $15 is a bit much for the content. If you like this kind of game, Phantom Breaker Battle Grounds is pretty similar (but larger side-scrolling stages)."

It's just plain not fun to play.

I have about three fifths of the bonus quests left to complete and maybe half of the remaining characters to unlock (which you get from completing the bonus quests). Unless I fail repeatedly, my guess is that I will clock in somewhere between 8 to 9 hours before I 100% this game. Edit: I take that back.
