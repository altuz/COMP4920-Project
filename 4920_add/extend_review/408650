76561198147915330,Recommended,408650,21511403,"Posted: 27 February, 2016",all,adamfirstone,"I love puzzle games like this one, and Magrunner, and the Portals.  I'm 70 yrs. old and I'm trying to keep my brain sharp.  But when the game designers INCLUDE a NECESSITY for DEXTERITY in the game, it really ticks me off.  I get really disappointed by the fact that I paid the same price as anyone else, or close to it, but I don't get to finish the game, because my fingers aren't as fast as my brain.  This game does just that.  I love the whole concept of mixing the colors to open the doors, and even getting the colors in the right orders.  It's a cool concept and fun to play and solve the puzzles.  BUT here I am running from a fire that my fingers just aren't fast enough to solve the puzzle.  Although I know WHAT to do, I can't physically do it.  Maybe I could if I did it over and over and over a million times, but I don't care to do that, that's why I bought a PUZZLE game.  Maybe I should have waited a while to cool down before I wrote this.  I recommend this game for anyone that loves puzzles, AND has the DEXTERITY to solve them!"
76561197972137781,Recommended,408650,22669644,"Posted: 27 April, 2016",all,Inspiral,"I nearly didn't buy ChromaGun because I read in another review that the difficulty spiked and the game went from gentle puzzling to demanding serious dexterity. I'm glad I chose to try it anyway.  For context, let me explain that I am an average gamer in my late-forties with serious sight issues, and yet I completed the game in around 10 hours with 100% achievements. The puzzles ranged from easy to mildly challenging. The basic mechanic of manipulating droids by changing their colour, or the colour of their surroundings, is a neat one. The devs have borrowed Portal's premise of a guy (or gal) going through test chambers. Critics might say this is unoriginal and I suppose they have a point, but at least it's better than the cheesy 'contestant in a deadly game show' format utilised by several of the other games in this genre. It also means Chromagun's  levels are bite-size - some of them take a few seconds to complete once you're figured the solution - so if you screw up it's no hardship to restart and try again.  This makes it a good game to boot up whether you have ten minutes to kill or wish to spend a few hours gaming.To sum up, ChromaGun isn't an ambitious game. The graphics and sound are solid and unpretentious, it's slick and bug-free, and there's a welcome side serving of humour in the voice over. Recommend. 8/10"

,Recommended,408650,23708401,"Posted: 22 June, 2016",all,Buzzintate,"The game has the same feel of portal with a different type of puzzle. That being said, I did have fun. However part of me feels like portal inspired this game, because it was way too similar with the announcer and the white tiles and the gun, ect. Some of the puzzles were not so clear at first and I found my own way to complete them. I wish this game was either longer or had better puzzles. The tedious, run for your life missions, got kind of annoying after a while but it was fine.buy this game if you miss portal or like puzzle games in general."

I've completed the game and i had a blast. it was refreshing to play another portalesq game. The commentary was hillarious and the gameplay while a bit easy in the beginning ramped up to a fun and chalenging later chapters. My request is that there eventually either add dlc that adds more levels that are more difficult. Or create a map creator similar to what portal 2 had and allow the community to create maps. This would not only allow new content for players to continue playing this awesome game, but after a editor would be created it would make less work for the Devs to create new content. I sincerely hope this game recieves frequent updates becuase i love it."

,Recommended,408650,23377585,"Posted: 4 June, 2016",all,lumiangames,"Okay, my first review, but here we go:Choma Gun is a 1st-Person Puzzle Shooter, whith Colors-Pellets instead of Lead-Bullets, dark Humor instead of dark Colors and Death instead of... forget it ^^'There are 26 Levels/Sections, divided in 8 Chapters, which have different tasks realized with a few, but cleverly used game-play mechanics, such as""lazy"" bots (will only move when they are colored like a  wall in their close vicinity),""stalking"" bots (which want to help you, but can be a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥,walls (usually white, but sometimes pre-colored)""Fences"" (which prevent you from coloring bots or walls)and several more.The graphics are, while not as realistic as some other games, as good as needed that there are no misunderstandings in the puzzles, so you can see the difference between a ""stalking"" bot and a normal, lazy one.Since I have a really weak machine (384 Cuda-Cores, DDR3-Ram) I had several times lags when there was a bit more happening on the screen, but it wasn't impossible to solve the puzzle in those levels.There are not many soundtracks, but they work well in the game, since you'll think hard most of the time, so the soundtrack does not disturb your thoughts. There is one person whom you'll hear often enough, he explains some mechanics, but most of the time he'll annoy you with some information that you are not good enough. It'll ceasy soon enough, but until then you'll be annoyedWhile my first playthrough was roughly 2 Hours, it is possible to finish the game in less that 40 Minutes, when you have memorized it at least once. The puzzles were sometimes challenging, sometimes eazy and sometimes you had to know that the solution was easier than anticipatedThere are achievements, some tend to annoy a little bit (after every chapter is one achievement), others are well designed, so you have to search, think and act a little bit different to unlock 'em all.I personally recommend everyone this game, that likes to think or wants to experience a puzzle-game that is easy to understand, but not so easy to master."
,Not Recommended,408650,23405040,"Posted: 5 June, 2016",all,Cubik,"This game is alright as a premise, but I think it needed a lot more work before asking for $10+. The controls are pretty clunky, the rooms are all bland and white, and overall it feels like the Alpha/Protoptype of a game that should've had more development put into it. It also tried way too hard to copy Portal's formula; You are given a puzzle-gun to solve puzzles in white rooms while a narrator watches and comments on your actions, all while the facility goes to♥♥♥♥♥♥as you are testing in it. The puzzles themselves are fairly simple, which may be a consequence of the simplistic premise that floating robots are attracted to color panels that match their own color.Normally I really love puzzle games, but I just can't recommend this one as is. It feels like an awkward, free mod to a better puzzle game. I just found it far too tedious and I rarely found any satisfaction in solving a puzzle."

If you loved Portal, you will most likely love this!This game is clearly inspired by Portal and also has a nice story narration accompanying the Riddles.The Rooms/Riddles themselves always have to do with the Three colors and the game can be quite challenging, especially since it is still introducing new features almost near the end of the game.And the Price is good too!  You'll definitely have a fun time with this, and for the speedsters: This game also has a specific Speedrun mode :P"

However, it fails to caputure the charm and creativity of it's insparation title.  It's colour matching mechanic isn't fun, coming off as the slightly educated version of a slow game of Bop-it. The rooms are very flat and uninteresting to look at, and the intercom voice comes off as harsh rather than comidically savage. I can honestly say that this is one unrefundable game I wish I could return."

The basic rules on what to do are pretty simple, with each puzzle involving using combinations of colours to guide the droids into opening doors.The game looks good, with a nice sciencey-type theme. I haven't noticed any glitches or weird texture problems or anything like that yet, which is great. There's also some good voice acting, with the person I assume is in charge of the test facilities guiding you and giving some funny comments."

,Recommended,408650,21338126,"Posted: 20 February, 2016",all,Krowi,"This is a fun game if you like games like Portal. I know this game is the first one the studio made and they did a good job in my opinion.Some things I didn't like as much is that there are no checkpoints in the levels itself like there are in Portal. If you fail at the last part of a room, you have to completely redo it and is especially annoying at those life threatening levels. Also, the game is a little short and I hope they'll add (free/cheap) expansions to this game and maybe a map editor for the Steam Workshop.All in all it's a good game but with only 3.4 hours on the timer and like a 30 minute sitting idle in a room makes this a short but fun game."

(I am running on Linux):- You can't reconfigure the key assignments. For 99% of you that's not a problem. For the few that don't use the standard keys it can be a deal breaker.- You can't tweak graphics advanced. That's fine, I might not allow it if I wrote a game myself (to avoid the support headache). But you can't enable frame sync and my graphics have distracting shearing and other distortions as a result.- The play concept seems fun, but the graphics quality themselves is poor and, in spite of what I read in other reviews, I thought the writing for the voice over was a painfully not-funny amateur attempt at Portal 2 like humor. I couldn't judge how good the voice itself was because the material was so bad that nothing could have saved it.- You'll notice I don't have much play time. The first time a robot killed me I crashed and dropped out of the program. Along with the other issues it wasn't worth it to me to try again and risk crashing all the time. I just bailed and wrote this review mostly to warn people about the keys."

,Recommended,408650,22768138,"Posted: 2 May, 2016",all,smashkeys,"Definitely worth a shot if you enjoy puzzle games. I was worried it was going to be a Portal clone (puzzles, gun, testing facility, jerk narrator, robots, etc.) but besides the surface similarities I was pleasantly surprised. I feel like I'm two thirds of the way through, so I'm a little concerned about the size of the game and replayability - so, if it does end in three hours in, I don't think its worth the $14. At 50% off, definitelty worth it."

There are a lot of similiarities, but the tech is different.

You are walking around with a color gun and you can shoot three different colors: blue, yellow and red.
