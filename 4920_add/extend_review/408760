But this one I thought i needed to as they are about to relaese a new version of this game.Firstly, I am a massive cycling fan and I ONLY recommend this for massive cycling fans and ONLY for the Be a Pro mode. Although i do play career mode, there just isnt enough content in it to recommend it. After being a lifelong player of game like Football Manager, this career mode isseriously bland and there is little depth too it.I realise it doesnt have the same budget as a game like FM, but small improvements could be made to make it more realistic, like the BIG stars not moving teams every year, and the teams chaning strip and sponsors EVERY year etc. On that, there is no license, thank ♥♥♥♥ for the guys who make real world names/jerseys/stats etc. Without the workshop content, i would not play this game.CRASHES CRASHES CRASHES.... and not the bike kind... this game crashes more than any game i have ever played before. Even the pop up to report the crash.... crashes. I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not. These crashes have literally happen on the same race/stage EVERY time you try to play it, it is completely unacceptable for them NOT to have fixed these.In saying that though, this is all we cycling fans have. I have over 200hrs in the game and will probably put in another 200 before i buy the next one. In itself, it is a reat game, and the Be A Pro mode makes you want to keep playing to better your rider so you can take on the big boys and the big races.I will buy the next version of the game when its out in the blind hope that they place more depth into the Be A Pro mode, as the career mode hasnt changed in 4 or 5 years. Heres hoping.If you are a cycling nerd then i recommend. If you are a fan of ""manager"" type games, then i DO NOT recommend this game as there are simply too many bugs and not enough depth."

During sprint and setting up sprint trains the game crashes while switiching between riders. I feel so sorry buying this game. Hope something will change for the better because I do like the game. But it is frustrating that the game freezes (sometimes the entire computer) in the heat of a finish.I do not recommend the game until the problems are solved.

Then when sending the crash report their servers just didn't work.Then next day I played for another hour managing to play the 3 pro cyclist intro races and it was exactly like last year. For real, there is absolutely nothing new about this game. Career mode is exactly the same as PCM 2015. I did not even play a stage because while planning the season it crashed several time and as this game is BS it doesn't save changes until you advance a day or go to the menu, my god, who thought that would be a good idea when you have to cross your fingers every time you press a menu button on this game. Absolute garbage, I've been buying this game since 2007 and I can't stand it anymore, got a refund and will skip this version entirely. Don't recommend at all if you have any PCM that's 2011+"

However, since the release of the game the Multiplayer game modes have been unavailable for longer than they have been available. Furthermore, there is no news whatsoever from the developers in regards to the problem and a possible fix, so all the players are completely in the dark.I really like the PCM series and have bought many editions in the past, but this might be my last. I would urge anyone considering to buy this game to at least wait until these issues are resolved, as multiplayer is pretty much unplayable at the moment and singleplayer still has the well known random bugsplats throughout a season."

,Recommended,408760,30958538,Posted: 5 April,all,Covfefe,"TL;DRIt's the only cycling manager game around and it has a few issues here and there (like CTDs in Paris-Roubaix on above Medium Graphics settings, not being able to continue past the World Championships date if you're not careful when selecting your team), but all in all it's a fun and relaxing game which, if you like cycling, can provide many hours of gameplay. If you catch it on sale, I definitely recommend it.----Tried to play Paris-Roubaix with Team Lotto Jumbo (for Sep Vanmarcke). Crashed midway through the race 3 times out of 3 attempts. The game, not Sep, fortunately. :)I guess we'll never know if he'll win it, because I'm not gonna spend any more time with this. Or probably any other future release, unless they can actually make a game that runs. Even for one single race would be an improvement. Until then, it's back to PCM 2013 for me, that one's always been stable, so far.If this game would not crash every time, I guess it'd be pretty good, but you can't tell if it's gonna work or not until you actually try it on your machine, so it's a gamble. If you're feeling lucky give it a shot, otherwise don't bother.A FEW HOURS LATER...So I've said earlier I wasn't gonna spend any more time with this, but since I had the day off and Support was quick to reply to my ticket, I followed their suggestions and did this:A. Please check that Pro Cycling Manager 2016 is correctly installed:1. Run Steam and click LIBRARY.2. Right click on 'Pro Cycling Manager 2016' and click 'Properties'.3. Click the tab 'LOCAL FILES' then click the button 'VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME CACHE'.B. Please configure Pro Cycling Manager 2016 in administrator mode at startup:1. Run Steam and click LIBRARY.2. Right click on 'Pro Cycling Manager 2016' and click 'Properties'.3. Click the tab 'LOCAL FILES' then the button 'BROWSE LOCAL FILES'.4. Right click on the application 'PCM' (PCM.exe) and click 'Troubleshoot compatibility'.5. Click 'Troubleshoot program' then check 'The program requires additional permissions' and click the button 'Next'.6. Click the button 'Test the program...'.7. Quit the game and click the button 'Next'.8. Click 'Yes, save these settings for this program' then click the button 'Close'.Now I made it to the finish line in Paris-Roubaix (sadly only 8th for Sep :P), but just as all the riders crossed the line it crashed again. It's something, but what I said before stands: it seems to be a particular buggy / capricious game and you can't be sure it'll work for you unless you try it. Technical issues aside, it would be a good game, but with all these crashes I can't recommend it.AND FINALLY...After doing this:C. Please configure the graphics settings to Medium:1. Run PCM162. Click on the Options icon (gear) from bottom left.3. Click the tab 'Display device' et select the preset 'Medium'.4. Click on the button 'Save Changes' and restart the game.I finally managed to finish Paris-Roubaix and also get to the Podium and Results screens, basically completing the race. And not crash to desktop. And beat Degenkolb in a sprint. With Sep Vanmarcke. :DIronically, after all these tweaks and technical issues, it makes finally completing a race (victorious on top) even more rewarding. But still not recommended. After almost a year since release and a handful of patches, the game should not be as unstable and picky about configurations as it is. When I got it I was hoping the patches would have sorted out most of the stability issues that people were complaining about (and which put me off of purchasing it earlier), but it's disappointing to see that I have to run it on Medium settings and keep my fingers crossed just to have a shot at actually completing a race. Maybe I'm just unlucky and stumbled upon some kind of incompatibility related particularly to my machine, but this is definitely the most buggy / unstable game I've played in a while.If you're a cycling fan and catch it on a (massive) discount, then get it and see how it works for you. But don't put your hopes up too high.MANY HOURS LATER...I've decided to start a career and the game went quite well, a couple of seasons in. Simulated some races, went 3D in many others, the crash on (Very) High Graphics settings appeared in Paris-Roubaix only, changed back to Medium and didn't have an issue with that since.Found a few other quirks here and there (for example be careful when picking your National Team riders, make sure the check mark is selected in front of them, not the question mark, or you'll risk being unable to continue past the World Championships date and the only way around this is to load a previous auto-save), but all in all the good outweighs the bad and the game is quite fun and relaxing. Initially I didn't recommend it, but to be fair, given the many hours I've spent playing so far, I'm changing this review to Recommended.I'm not sure how relevant this is now that PCM 2017 is out, but if you're a cycling fan and catch it on sale or don't yet want to spend more on the latest release (I'd wait for some patches first), this may be a good game for you."

You can spend a good 45 minutes playing out a stage, get an incredible result only for the game to crash after the finish line and you lose your progress. However, that is not the worst...You can start a solo rider professional career, spend countless hours improving your rider & the game will crash a couple of seasons in and you will lose all progress gained. You will never be able to re-load & best of all nobody at the game developer or Steam cares one bit....they have your money already.So all in all, you'll buy a product which doesn't work (i.e. defective) as it should & you will never get a refund or any type of assistance/communication.Worst.

For other spports fans, i'm not so sure. The game is very complicated in some aspects, and can often seem quite confusing for people not watching real life cycling.The game is enjoyable and has a large learning curve. There is a high ceiling for skill level, as the possibilities of strategies are ENDLESS. This can also been as one of the biggest weaknesses of this game though. Because this game can be very confusing and complicated for some people, it can draw people away from playing this game. Most of all people that have no clue what they are doing. (Attacking with their riders from the start and such).Overall this new edition of the pro cycling manager series has seen minor but great improvements.Would i recommend it to people who have never bought a PCM game? Yes.Would i recommend it to people who bought PCM15? Not as much.There are only minor improvements to the gameplay (New hud design, which is amazing btw, small improvements to career and pro cyclist), as the biggest change was the overhaul in the online mode.Would i recommend the game to people who skipped PCM15? Yes.The new pro cyclist mode has been improved, and as for that the game can be a total bombshell of new experiences.So to conclude, i would recommend this game, but only if you know what you are doing and what you need to do in the game."

I like the career mode too, although you should know that it's a lot of arranging things before you actually play the race. For example you can make training schedules and be happy with the sponsor."

The interface somethimes simply doesnst work, features are not working on the managing interface, etc etc. The database itselfs isn't representing the proper stats.I simply want to start a team with a self created rider as the ""main guy"", like sky revolves around froome. I don't want to play as froome. is a hussle to make that happen"

Unfortunately, that's where the fun ends.Why I do not recommend the game:1. Crashes, many other reviews already mention it, the game has been up for nearly a year and it still has the amount of crashes you would expect from a game in early beta. It is at an unacceptable level, such that I wonder if it's even responsible for steam to offer the game, as you're buying a flawed product.2. The management part of the game lacks, the interface is clumsy to use, for example if you want to assign cyclists to a training camp you're unable to see the breakdown of the cyclists (which is very annoying if your starting a low level squad with many unknown cyclists). Generally there are just not many things you can influence from a manager's perspective on the long run.Concluding: I love the concept of a cycling manager game, however the game is a faulty product which feels like it's in beta. This is unacceptable for such a long running series. Cyanide needs to step it up and make their game actually playable."

This is a fun cycling simulator if you haven't played any PCM games before.  However my career mode in 16' is completely bugged out and won't let me sign new sponsor deals in addition to the record book part showing the same riders for every year or just blanks.  It's a big mess.I've played 15 and 16 and the feature differences are so minor it's just disappointing for career mode, and although I haven't played it you would probably get better value to get the 2014 edition for $10, or if it goes on sale.  I love the concept of this game but every year it feels like it's just not improving the way I would expect it to.If you don't own a PCM game and like cycling I would get one but I would go for one of the cheaper versions because they have 95% of the same stuff."
