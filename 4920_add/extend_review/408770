,Recommended,408770,22716155,"Posted: 29 April, 2016",all,AbbydonPrime,"Before playing, I applied the adult patch in order to unlock the full story (it's not actually a patch; it's a boolean setting). I also altered the font as the white glow around blue words was a bit annoying. On my second run, I put the censoring back on to see how the editing went. This helps provide dual input for the review.At first, it seemed like it would be typical anime VN. At the start, it's all guy at school with 2 girls he's hot for. But, that just leads to the real story involving some serious social problems.In the typical ""what's it like as the opposite sex"" style, the adult version involves some extended masturbatory scenes when he first takes over each one. The censored version has at least one awkward cut where the dialog obviously implies what just happened, but the transition also made it obvious that something big was cut out. There's another couple of scenes that give the wrong impression with the censoring in place. If you can tolerate hentai, you may want to enable the adult content just for continuity. It also extends the length of the story, and some of it provides extra plot detail for Akiko's situation.Back to the story. The initial takeover does involve the curious exploration due to the novelty of being in someone else's body, but it's not the main focus. It's more of a Quantum Leap style situation. The story revolves around him trying to figure out what is going on, learning about the truth of their lives, and then trying to change them for the better. We never find out why or how he was jumping, but we (and he) learn that his two love interests, both of whom he thought were so perfect, actually have dark secrets.One of them has a bullying and consequential confidence problem. The other has an exploitative relationship and severe depression. I know most of this all too well. So, I could actually relate to the girls' situations and connect with them more. When all of this started up, I was drawn in. The story does not have branching, but the choices do end up causing slight variations in outcome and dialog. In the end, the choices made while possessing each one will decide if either one reveals their feelings, or if one of the bad endings happen.There are a few negative points to mention:The adult scenes could've been toned down a bit. I can understand some R or NC-17 type content, but the extended XXX ones were a bit much. For a VN, they even seemed weird. With Kasumi, the scene was way ahead of what the dialog was saying. There are only 2 or 3 frames used for each of them, so the ""action"" in the dialog just wasn't in sync. Also, the ending scenes were superfluous. They are simply fan service.The default slightly smiling pose for both girls is used quite a lot during some serious situations. At the very least, it could've used a more neutral expression. It would've been even better if the face showed the emotion of the dialog.The pool scene is too detailed, and it doesn't match the description in the dialog. Right near the start of it, the dialog mentions the water reflecting on the ceiling, yet it's an outdoor pool. Some more dialog also makes it sound indoors.The game is quite short. I'm sure that all of the plot components could've been expanded upon without requiring more adult gratuity, and it would've been nice to have some type of information on how/why he could jump in the first place.Due to the mostly serious nature of the story and how it covers some really important topics, as well as hopefully providing an important lesson or insight for certain players, I am recommending this one. I hate to even use this word since it's overused and abused, but some people may be ""triggered"" by the content. Consider yourself warned. Also, the price is a bit high for the length, but I got it on the Anime Weekend Sale for $3.14, so I think I got my money's worth.---For more...My Reviews||My casual gaming...Group|Curator Page"

Like.Dialogue is hard to read sometimes, because the player character only has a name in the UI in the adult content epilogue, before that it's just when there is no name that the main character is talking, and when that's in italics he's thinking. So, yea, watchout for that. No italics means he's talking.Dialogue sometimes isn't seperated I'm sure, so the MC is talking when it says someone else is talking, Awkward.Really short, took me under 90 mins to get both good endings. There is supposedly two bad endings, but I never got them because the choices were really really obvious. Or I'm really good at VN's. But they were obvious to me. I got the second good ending first though, but it was hard to tell which was it was going because I think I nailed both routes.Both good endings were really the same route, but with literally a different last scene, and then epilogue if you have the adult patch on.If you don't have the adult patch on, this game has almost nothing to offer.It cost money, when you can technically just google up the adult content scenes.I didn't like the art style.None of the characters were good. I didn't like them.I can't believe I started this with the lights off to try and feel more immersed.The adult content's dialogue didn't line up with the images.2 of the 6 sex scenes are rapey, 2 of them are masturbation. I don't like that either. No thankyou boss.♥♥♥♥♥♥isn't attractive.There are no voice acting, only three or four sound tracks, and like 4 backgrounds and just. Idek how to structure this as a review dudes.I'll give it this howeverThe adult content was pretty decent I guess, Idk though dude.It seemed to reasonably portray the issues the girls have pretty well. I think.Uhhh I got to tick off that I played another VN, and I now have recieved lots of nice advertisements from the dev company in my email box, which is really cool.Honestly, I got this for like £2 on a heavy sale, and I'd rather have bought a cs:go key and got a blue drop."

You feel intimidated by their perfection and would never dream that either could have problems... or be interested in you. And then... something happens... and you find yourself in each of their bodies on successive days... and you find out what really is going on.The game reaches has four endings apparently, two good, two bad. The achievements are tied to the two good endings."

This game has three positives 1. it brings out that you should ask for help if you are suffering from depression, 2. That bullying in school is a problem ( does not provide a real solution-- but it is just a vn), 3. It is very short and the art was good.Negatives are everything else. If I detailed them all there would be nothing for you to experience in the game. If you play this game you will understand why being very short is listed as a positive. I will give just one example --going into a coma and possessing 2 girls is the most plausible part of the story. Enough said!"

The art is good, although sometimes the facial expression doesn’t match the character’s feelings. That kinda bothered me…That’s it, basically. It’s quite short, and if you enjoy these kinds of VNs, get it when the game is on sale. I don’t think it’s worth the full price, to be honest.5/10."

I flipped the censorship flag to ""false"" to see the whole thing.I haven't read many body swapping stories before, so I wasn't sure what I'd be in for.  The main character's response seems pretty natural (it's a dream, I can do as I want), but then the issues each of the friends has comes to light and brings you down to earth.  How do I or can I help?I finished all four endings in around two hours.  Considering what I pay for a manga these days and how fast I read them, this was good value for money vs time spent."

Would of been nice if there were more girls to chose from and maybe get more endings, maybe even one with you staying in the life of another person. I think this concept would work for another Visual Novel.So far I got the best ending with the blond girl Akira (or whatever her name is) and two bad/normal endings. Still trying to figure out how the end up with the blue haired girl Kasumi (again whatever he name is). If another knows how to get the ending without spoiling the plot, I would be gratful.I recommend anyone to try out this game, regardless it being short and hope this might be used in another Visual Novel with more character romance options and a longer story/plot."

,Recommended,408770,28583295,"Posted: 23 December, 2016",all,Apoc,"Short but sweet. It starts like a regular VN but then actually bring pretty serious subjects on the plate likedeath, suicide and bullying. The art is great and there are, surprinsingly, considerering the length of the novel, at least 4 different good quality tracks.There are a few choices but I would not call them paths, they change the next few lines and then there are 4 different endings but picking one option won't change anything until the end. You have all the same choices to make everytimes and it is the combination of decisions that decide your ending. It took me a little bit more than an hour to get one ending and then ctrl-skip to get the other 3.One pretty big flaw is the font, the textbox is really pale and the font is always blue with a white outline. It can be hard to read against some of the backgrounds and seems pretty low quality compared to the artworks. If the novel was longer it would be a big turn off but for this case it is tolerable.If you value the price with the length it might not be a good purchase at full price but it is an interesting visual novel."
