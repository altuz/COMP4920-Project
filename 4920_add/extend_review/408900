It's got this very Alien vibe (Alien, not Aliens. Both very good but very different) to it that I love. But presently this game is broke as ♥♥♥♥. Now I've played my fair share of beta and alpha games, but this one is truly broken. I my last 5 games, 3 of my spawns just broke completely and I had to restart the game to go anything.I know this game is going to be great and all its issues are going to get fixed, but for now you might want to hold off for a few months til they fix things up a bit more."

This game LOOKS fun, let me say.The problem is, there are never any servers open. Opening your own doesn't come up with any results, and if you play a game with bots, be prepared to:A. Be the monster every round without variationB. Have an incredibly easy game because the AI still need workC. Have trouble seeing because everything is super-dark (and this is a problem any way you look at it)If you really want to buy this, feel free to. Unfortunately, this game still needs a lot of work and a lot more traffic."

Great idea and I don't mind that its in Alpha or when games are in Alpha in general. I expect Alphas to be buggy and have issues... but this game is currently unplayable. Theres 1 server at a time, and that server is usually bugged out meaning you can't join and freeze at start."

I've come across a few crashes already in my 9 hours of playing it, the melee combat of the monster is very basic and the main reason I don't recommend it is the Dev's. After the incident with TDL they aren't really worth of trust and I literally don't trust them enough to keep up with this game.It might get better, it might not."

Its either good or bad.So the good1-Neat idea, reminicent of the thing movie. One of your crew is not what they appear and wants to eat you.2- very comedic very funny3- indavidual idea of survival in space4- decent enough graphics5-The more you play the more free quirks for your paye you unlock like faster speed, more health more ammo etc.The bad1- No multiplyer I can see for a wholly multiplayer game. I have tried refreshing the servers for internet and get nothing.2- AI players you can play with run one way, then the other and barely interact with you.3- Playing against AI you are always the monster. Developers need to change this so you can be regular spacemen.4- I'm having a bit of trouble with visuals where I gointo a new room or corridor and it momentarily goes all white and takes a while to load properly. A bitty minor thing but still annoyingSo in conclusion I wouldnt buy thsi game till the devlopers have at least sorted the server selection out. The idea is great dont get me wrong and I look forward to playing this in the future with many of my freinds but at the moment even withoiut game breaking glitches or hackers etc thsi game isnt worth it simply because there isnt much to play."

Make of that what you will but if you don't like to gamble then this is a definite no for you.Most of the positive reviews so far (if not all) are from alpha testers of the game, which i'm guessing are also on duty to spam that downvote button on reviews like this, actually the player base is so heavy on the ""got this for free as an alpha tester/streamer"" side that Steamspy detects this as being a free to play game, yet hardly any of them clicking that little ""got this product for free"" button on their reviews.Have now been forum banned by the ""dev"" (blueprinter) for a mixture or warning him about selling other companies trademarks as cosmetics for his game and only having 2 products left in my account (after refunding this and removing the broken TDL). First he claimed he had made the textures himself (before he deleted that message), which even if true (hint, its not) does not allow you to sell it, as it's another companies trademark, just ask Walmart, who got sued for making their own smiley face and using it to promote their products. Secondly, just because you download a ""royalty free"" image, does not mean you can sell it as your own:""Another restriction on a basic royalty-free image license is that the products on/in which the images appear cannot feature the image as the dominant visual if the end product is then going to be sold. For example, when you buy an RF image, you cannot then turn around and print the image onto a t-shirt and sell the t-shirt if the image is the dominant one on the shirt. Similarly, you can't present the image available for download from a website, such as for computer wallpapers. ""images:http://imgur.com/a/w2npYIt's a definite no for me anyway, if your looking for a half decent game in this genre that you dont have to take a massive gamble on then go buy Damned."

The locations of the supply boxes and samples do change, which helps keep this re-playable without being confusing.They do have ""achievements"" of sorts, which help you get different types of helmet shields, abilities, etc. It also seems like these sorts of options/choices may be expanded in the future.The developers do interact with people playing or interested in playing their games, and from my experience so far, are very friendly and helpful.CONS:The game is so new that not many people are playing this yet, which is a bummer because it is hard to find other people to play against. If you play against bots, you will be the monster every time - bots can't be the monster (confirmed by Zag himself - thanks, Zag!) and you're it. However, when there are other humans on the server, the random choice of who plays the monster does add quite a bit.The tutorial is a lot of reading, and is not interactive at all. Moving was pretty straightforward, especially if you've played Minecraft with the default movement keys. However, if you want to learn how to use any of your abilities, you have to pay attention to the tutorial and the HUD, and use some trial and error to get the hang of it.Once I have more playtime under my belt, I may add more to this. Also, as development progresses, some of the above may change. For now, these are my first impressions."

,Recommended,408900,35007708,Posted: 16 September,all,「SUNBOAT」,"Unfortunate Spacemen - A game that will make you comedically kill all of your party members, one by one.The game, even though in EA. And with a small playerbase. Is quite fun at this moment in time. Let me go into some detail.- SPACEMENHumans sent from the company they work on, arrive at a ""Station"". Fixing it up, and sending crates and research samples into space. Such goals are to re-activate power, clear landing pads, and generally be a helping hand by making sure everything's in shape.  Buutt.. This game wouldn't have Unfortunate in the name, if it only had Spacemen.- THE ALLENThe Allen is a creature hellbent on destroying everything the Spessmen hold dear. The power, breaking open virus canisters to infect the Spessmen. And, of course. Killing them.The balance, currently. Seems fairly well. You need to be a cunning S.O.A.B to survive the round as either side. Each weapon does low damage against the monster, aside from explosives and flames. However, those only occur late in a round.The entire team has to team up against the Monster, unless you stick a Hand Grenade in a microwave and lob it to the Allen. You will NOT win alone. Though, most of the time. You will do a certain amount of damage. Unless you're just absolutely mucked up.However, the line between friend and foe is way blurred. You can steal key-cards, push people into space ejectors. Flashbang your commrades to test if they're human. You cannot walk alone in this game, but you also cannot walk with someone untrustworthy. Most of the time, you don't know if that Electric Mucus guy is actually your best friend. Or just waiting to corner you in a meatlocker.There's a handful of weapons, not an insane amount, but still a decent amount of guns for this game.. Besides, too many guns would be heck to balance.- Handgun- Assault Rifle- Grenades- Rocket Lawnchair- Flamethrower- THE SHOTGUN- Probably More.Don't forget about the Space Milk. You know, the one that makes you see the eldritch god N'zul Katmandu, bringer of the end times. Which then sends you somewhere.. Miight be a space ejector, or a quaint place. Like a blood-filled hallway.This game is essentially Trouble in Terrorist Town, in space. With The Thing. And Milk.When you see a game that allows you to drink poisonous milk and throw grenades at your friends, it's probably a good one.No game is meant for everyone, but this game is great if you want a game to just bro out with random strangers every weekend. This might change, but right now. Not many people play it in the weekdays. But there ARE community games hosted every saturday at 2:00 PM EST.If you have the money, buy it and try it out on the next saturday you got. If you don't like it, refund it. However, I truly feel like it's worth a try.DO NOT BUY WITHOUT A MICROPHONE. YOU WILL GET SHOT IN THE LEGGY LEGS.Remember to shill out $50 for DUSK please - Lord Zag."

Me and some friends bought this title during the Winter Sale because we were bored by a lack of ridiculous multiplayer games since Overwatch. We were pleasantly surprised by the decent, if cartoony, graphics and the solid game systems. Basically, you are a group of unfortunate spacemen stranded inside various installations with a shapeshifting monster and you are tasked with running about and completing various chores (resetting transmitters, launching samples, and clearing landingpads) before the creature devours you.The idea is good and the implementation is well put together for an alpha-level game but there are virtually no players on the game which is a real shame as we think you need a game of at LEAST 8-10 players to get the most out of this.Now there are a lot of imbalances and a few noticable bugs but nothing that is game breaking at this point. We really hope this title takes off and draws a solid playerbase as the developers add a little more content!"

,Recommended,408900,22838919,"Posted: 6 May, 2016",all,Crunchy Soap,"Some of you may be wary of buying into this game because of the developer's history with the failed game; The Dead Linger. Now luckily, I know the story behind TDL and I understand that sometimes, sh*t happens. The developers have moved on, and so have we. (They've also given previous owners of TDL a 65% discount on this little gem right here, which is more than generous).NOW. Bring forth, Unfortunate Spacemen. The concept of this game had me interested right off the bat. Think of a multiplayer game version of the movie The Thing. Sounds too good to be true, right? This game aims to make that a reality. Mind you, that's only one of the many inspirations behind this title. Unfortunate Spacemen truly is a unique, new, creative, and most importantly - fun game to play.Now of course, it's Early Access and that means some issues, some frustrations, some bugs, and some other bullsh*t. ""Purchasing"" this game is an investment. If you are'nt prepared for someunfortunatestuff to happen during development, please don't buy into this. Too many people purchase an EA game so they have something new to b*tch about. Honestly that goes for all games. Right now the only issue I have with Spacemen is the matchmaking. It's very rough, and hopefully is a top priority BUT - it still works. I had a server going with 18 people connected, and it was awesome.I'm gonna' skip right ahead to the meat and potatoes of the reasons why I'm bothering to write up this ""review"".I'm doing it because the developers - so far - are totally rad. For example I had an issue where I was trying to buy my friend a copy, since I have 65% discount that they gave owners of their previous game. It wasn't allowing me to purchase a gift copy, so I made a post, to which a dev replied in a matter of minutes and immediately sent an e-mail to Valve. Valve then revealed that they turned off gifting options for people with a discount because they didn't want people getting multiple copies of the game for cheap. Yet, the developer told them to allow it anyway - that immediately earned my respect. On top of that, these guys areactuallyplaying their own game (shoutout to Thunderfist), and they actually communicate with their players.I love the concept, I'm happy with how they've executed it, and I'm more than pleased with how the developers have presented themselves and treated their fanbase. Honestly if I knew they were gonna' be that cool about things, I probably would have asked to pay full price anyway. As far as I'm concerned, this is already easily worth $15.Keeping my fingers crossed for the futue of Unfortunate Spacemen!- Crunchy Soap™"

Sometimes the unfortunate spacemen even gang up on the monster and kills it.There is a load of ways to play the game you have many perks at your dispose already in this state of the game and more to come, Sandwept the dev team have a development roadmap where you can see every planned feature and it's current state which gives a better interaction between players and developers.I would recommnd you play this, it has great replayability and is great to play with your friend or just random people."

There is an emerging market of the ""one (monster, alien, killer, etc..) vs. the rest"" type of games, but this one stands out. It's the only one I've seen where the monster is disguising themselves as a player. Which is a super fun twist. It's an amazing concept, reminds me of The Thing made into a fun video game. It establishes a level of nervousness and paranoia that can only be achieved through the mechanic of the monster being able to be a person just like everyone else. Being in its early development stages, it's bound to have a few bugs. I haven't personally experienced any yet but I was told about a few by some players I was playing with. Finding a match may be a bit tricky, since the player-base is still growing, but it's a freaking blast when you're able. From what I've seen, the devs seem to be really communicative with the players -- which is always great. It plays really smoothly and, while already a great game in alpha, has a lot of potential to become even more awesome. For the price, I highly recommend."

There are still some remnants of the connectivity/loading issues mentioned previously, but the rate at which they appear has been diminished significantly. They might even have gone away entirely since the Sunny Side Up patch but I have not played since that patch was released so I can't verify entirely.But, that said, the bugs have been worked out to a point that I think is very acceptable for an Early Access game so I am changing this review to a positive! The games I was able to play were fantastic and filled with fun and tension. A lot of it depends on the people you play with, and the more talkative players you can get, the better. Playing as a Spaceman is a fun mix of paranoia and tension and the rounds are a good mix of winning and losing, depending on how the monster plays. There are also numerous ways to go about your objectives as the monster so it varies each round, which keeps things fresh. The 15 minute time limit is a perfect amount of time to get objectives done but also keep you constantly moving and preventing the game from stagnating. There are multiple maps, but all anyone ever plays on is Echo. I tried out some of the other maps but people just mostly complained until I changed it to Echo. That is another downside though is that the game doesn't exit back to lobby and there isn't a way to vote for a map change or even force change it yourself as host at the end of a round or set of rounds.The things I would recommend being aware of if you are a new player are the small playerbase (not a lot of people are on and you need to play in peak hours to find a game). Basically, don't expect to play outside of the hours of 7ish to midnight. Also, there is a bug (again, SSU patch may have fixed this) where servers will only list 1/31 players in the game, regardless of how many players are actually in it. So you have to join the game to see how active it is.I would also be aware of the crashing/joining/connection issues. They have, for me, almost gone away entirely, but your experience may vary. Also, again, keep in mind that a lot of your fun depends on other players. I have not had any bad experiences with the community, but as it continues to grow, this could change.Lastly, the pistol damage seems too small. Everyone starts with it though, so I get that it can't be too powerful, and the balance of heavy weapons on the map seems good because you don't want everyone powered up, but I got into a pistol duel with someone and we shot at each other for literally five straight minutes dancing around and neither one of us died and we eventually just ran in opposite directions. If you have just a pistol and are facing down the monster, it is better to just run.I don't want to end on a negative note so I will say this: this game has, I believe, a terrific future ahead of it. The devs somehow took a horror setting (imo) and, instead of it becoming less frightening with more players, it just gets scarier. That is an achievement in itself. That's not to say that you won't experience some goofy/funny moments, but the overall feeling is very tense and that is a big positive for a game like this. The devs also seem very active in their work on this. I gather from other reviews that there might be some bad blood from a previous project? I can't speak on that, but I can speak on what I've seen with this game and the updates come frequently and they seem to be very aware of the current issues, what needs to be done to fix them, and where the game is heading.I would definitely recommend buying this game. It is a unique multiplayer game that blends a lot of elements together in a wonderful way. The more people that play, the better the games get, so I would love to see more players involved. I'm typically very wary of Early Access games, but I can say that from what I have seen with this, it is at a point where you should feel safe investing your time and money into it. It is only going to get better. I hope to see a lot more of you Spacemen out there.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EDIT 1: I played the game since the new patch, and while the crashing problem has gone away, it seems to have been replaced with (or maybe this has always been a problem and I never got far enough to try it) connectivity/loading issues. Mainly, when trying to join, I will get to in-game screen and I can see other Spacemen running around, but will get no options to do anything. If it's not that, then I'll get sent to a black screen where it sticks in an infinite loading screen. Anytime this happens, I am forced to ALT+F4 out because there is no other recourse, so basically it went from crashing on its own to forcing me to crash it. I tried joining after the host sent the game back to the lobby, and I still got slammed into the never-loading start screen when the host started the game again.I managed to get into and play one game, which was fun (mostly bots, but a handful of real people). We lost due to the time limit, but I had a couple tense, close calls with the monster that were exciting. The gameplay is fun on its own, but the true experience seems like it will be heavily dependent on the people you play with. I am glad that my initial thoughts that it would be fun were validated by it actually being fun.Unfortunately, I have to leave the review as negative. The general instability as a whole is just too much to be able to overlook it, even in Early Access. Getting into one game out of six attempts is just no bueno. It is a good sign that patches seem to be coming out on a pretty quick basis though, and I have no doubt that eventually (and possibly very soon) this review will turn to Positive, but I just can't do it right now. If it were solely based on the gameplay, it'd already be a Positive, but if I can't get to the gameplay, then what's the point?------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ORIGINAL: The concept and gameplay look and sound fun from videos I watched from other people, but that is about all you are going to be able to do. It seems like luck of the draw whether or not the game will run for you. At any point, for any reason it feels like, the game will kick you back to the menu, or completely crash. This can happen in menus, in the lobby select, in-game waiting to start, in-game while you spawn, and just at any point in-game, period. This is even if the game will launch in the first place.There are numerous other bugs, things you would expect from an Early Access game, so I'm not going to list those. But when the game is near-completely unplayable, it should not be released in any form, at all. I have not once been able to complete a whole match, and the most I ever got to play of a match was three minutes.tl;dr DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It has the potential to be something great, but that something will never exist in Early Access."

It is a simple but very very fun game that you can enjoy alone or with friends.Don't stop playing just because your screen is frozen or you lose connection to the servers. It can happen for a first version but it's their top priority to fix atm. Once you get in a game, you really enjoy it, trust me."

Also run really well on lower end PC so you can use a crappy laptop to play it. As it is however do to a lack of players in the game it really hard to get into a match i mean sure you can just do it with bots, but their not really designed to a challenge due to the fact that they don't really complete task like they should and will ingore the moster if they turn back into a spaceman right in front of them. Really there in the game tho to prevent that odd 1v1 were you know the moster is just the onther guy roaming around the map sense your the only two people in the game."

I see tons of negative reviews praising the gameplay and concept, but crying the game is buggy and un-stable.  No sh!t.  The game is in Alpha, geniuses.With that said, this game is pretty hysterical, and I typically dislike FPS.  It's basically a 15-minute murder-mystery in space.  The best part is when you're the monster, and hearing the screams and surprise of murdering the spaceman you've been helping for the past three minutes, as he turns and see you suddenly morph.You can set traps (the air lock decompression is always satisfying) and you can sabotage the power, equipment, etc.  You got to be slick though, because if peeps see you acting weird ... blamo!  Much of the games charm also comes from the in-game voice-chat.  You have to be a little bit of a real-life actor to ""accidentally"" shoot, push people offa bridges, drop a flash bang or call people to a room to kill them one-by-one.The game is currenly $12.00.  It's buggy as hell, but it has great potential and well worth the price in it's current state.  I'd strongly reccomend supporting this one."

One guy is ""it"" and must kill off the others while keeping his secret identity unknown and growing stronger with each death. If you have friends to play with, this game is downright amazingly fun. If not, well, it is still quite fun.The lacks a lot of features to fully flesh out even the basic gameplay as stands, such as stopping time when the creature is in the escape shuttle with the spacemen until either side dies. Or making it so the creature can't just burrow in the corner and wait out the round with just a little sabotage.All in all, game is great, with a dedicated dev team that tries their best."
