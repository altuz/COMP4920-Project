It had both positive points and negative points. Here they are:Positive:Looked pretty good.Had a pretty good diversity of weapons.Had some interesting plot pointsNegatives:Pacing (too fast)Story telling (the plot points were good, but they weren't developed)No character creation (not a huge deal, but can be important for RPG gamers)Lack of autonomy - there are very few moral choices of consequence in the game. It seems like you are just thrust into the next situation, even if you did not want to move on and did not get to make a choice about which faction you sided with.Anyway. I'm sure many other people did better and more thorough reviews, but hopefully this helps you not get lured intot he trap of seeing some cool looking screen shots and buying the game."
,Recommended,408920,30976477,Posted: 6 April,all,Redrusty66,"Nice game, especially with the extended update. Having Fallout 1,2 and tactics on disk from way back, this game does remind me of them, not too many in the genre. Of course it isn't some fancy AAA title but I actually like it slightly better than the fallout series (Save new vegas of course). Being a road warrior, rover, post-apoc type fan I do like the atmosphere. I also like that the devs are of that rare breed these days who actually continue to support and attempt to expand and tweak their title. a thing way too rare these days of typical steam scams and abandoments.. Overall the game is certainly nice for the price, I have been enjoying the campign, missons and atmosphere. I see a lot of crybaby hate from FO fanbois, as if everything is suppose to be New Vegas..lol If you have no such personality flawsand can judge a game on it's own merits then I would certainly recommend this. I've played a lot of games for a very long time, and this one is a fairly nice one, and the attention it continues to recieve from the devs is also a refreshing change. 7-8/10 and wortt having in your collection IMO. Nice gameplay, atmosphere and graphics and does what it sets out to do so far., Could of course, like ost every game, use more content and tweaks, but worth the price."

Exp rewarding is poor for instance in combat you only get xp if you land a killing blow, if you have npcs following you there is no interaction with their tactics other than stay close or go long, the environment is ok to look at but has very little interaction, the translations have gotten better but are still obviously very rusty.I was very surprised to see this 'extended cut' come out as the last time I had a look at this it was a buggy early access mess, this is truly poor marketing I really don't care if all the fan boys give this a thumbs down playing through this is just a depressing experience of how not to make a game well and this mediocrity in every aspect is not something that should be rewarded or praised."

I think this game is gem. If fallout 2 and wasteland 2  are 9/10. then I can definitely give 7 or even 8 to this game.In term of graphic, it is much better than fallout 2 though the elements are not as rich as fallout 2. Actually I personally think the plot is deeper than fallout 2, which is too straight forward. There are also many weapons that you can choose. Many RPG elments. Overall, it is very very good game and I enjoyed it."
76561198003148672,Recommended,408920,24332977,"Posted: 15 July, 2016",all,Trig_the_Poor_Shot,"TL;DR: It has some flaws, but overall I really like it!This postapoc world somehow makes more sense to me than those of Fallouts and Wastelands. The game is nicely paced, some quests are quite difficult to figure out and pull off, which I enjoy. The storytelling is good, though the English is a bit broken sometimes, but who has times for dictionaries in a radiated world anyway. Random encounters are many and varied, though the terrains they occur on become a bit repetitive after a while.I enjoy the battle mechanics, but it would be nice if the player had some control over his companions (now the AI controls them all), as usually they tend to just blindly charge the enemy and you have to constantly keep saving them from certain death, by taking the hits meant for them. Makes the tactic of sniping safely from afar rather useless. This is particularly annoying when you're escorting (and protecting) traders, as they're weak, unarmoured, but still charge ahead and get killed after only a few hits. Basically all combat AI does is zero in on the closest enemy and gets in range to shoot or club them. No flanking, no keeping distance for shooters, no tactics.I like the fact that barter prices aren't the usual ""10 when selling, 100 when buying"" like in most RPGs, but with just a bit of a margin for the trader, so you can make some decent profits selling loot you've risked your life for. A storage locker somewhere in the world (or at least a trunk in your vehicle) would be nice for stowing away the items you wish to keep but are not currently using. As it is now, you want to convert any heavy object into weightless ammo asap by bartering it away, as the carry limit is quite low, particularly if you put on any armour.The music is very nice and fitting to the atmosphere of the game and the graphics are what I'd expect from this sort of a game.I do hope the devs keep working on the game, upgrade and improve it, because it is an unpolished gem with a lot of potential to become a classic of this genre.Overall I give this game a:10/10 for awesome post-apocalyptic atmosphere9/10 for music (the bar track with the shredding guitar also shreds your nerves after a while)7/10 for storytelling8/10 for combat mechanics concept but only1/10 for extremely stupid and completely brainless combat AI"

The storyline needs a litle polish but the enviroments are well crafted. The battle system is nothing new but still engaging and it is not forgiving of mistakes made. The companion path finding is slow and this can cost you in an encounter so keep your companions close."

The journal could use some work and the combat can be unforgiving at times, but overall it's a good game. A lot of attention to detail with the environments. Dialogue could use a bit of proof-reading."

Hopefully it is updated on a regular basis, and I really hope that developers would be able to finallize it soon.Now, a short summary for those who are interested in buying the game: it is defenitely a solid product, worth investing the money, but it is still buggy, semi-complete and lacking several must-have features/options. If you want a finallized version - it is worth waiting for a while indeed, putting it on wishlist. Otherwise - enjoy the Russian-Ukranian version of Wasteland 2."

The graphics are really nice people complain about the unity engine but I must say it certainly captured the post apocalyptic atmosphere of the original fallout games I love. The main story starts off a tad slow but then takes off very well. I do think they could have a put a few more side missions to do though but I didn't mind doing caravan runs to build my character up. The length was good took me just over 18hrs to finish not bad for $10 game.I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is looking for fallout style isometric game it sure did bring back awesome memories of nostalgia for me.
,Not Recommended,408920,28294298,"Posted: 10 December, 2016",all,Mutant,"This is *not* a Fallout 1/2 successor, or even Wasteland. This is an exceptionally basic RPG with little plot and poor gameplay. The visuals are interesting, but that's about it. There just isn't alot going for this game. Nothing is explained, but the I realized it doesn't matter because the game is so shallow there's no need to explain anything. No meat."

While it still has a long way to go before it is a polished game, including a script rewrite the game has great potential and a great premise.  It has clearly been made on a very very small budget and therefore I am more than willing to back this game for such a small price.The developer keeps working on this and we have what can potentially be a post apocolypse classic."

I know I should not be so harsh, games are hard to develop and all, but this is the extended cut version -meaning it was revised with content added...so for it to be in such a state where animations don't chain up, combat sequences go on when enemies are dead, enemies attack you only and not your party...I don't know what to say. I really wanted this game to be all that the preview announced it to be, but it ain't. Big fan of Baldur's Gate. Thought I was getting something of similar quality. Nope. Disappointed."

,Recommended,408920,33202487,Posted: 3 July,all,xSilas43,"This game is great, if you are a fan of CRPG games like Fallout 1 & 2, Wasteland, Diablo this game is very reminiscent of those titles. The writing so far is pretty solid, quite interesting and hilarious! While the levels are some what linear the game itself has a great open world aspect where you are just out exploring the waste. While the character customization itself it kind of limited but that doesn't stop you from creating your own personalities for characters. This game feels like a true spiritual successor to Fallout 2."

It is possible that the combat system is the bee´s knees - I just wouldn´t know.What I do know is, the writing is *atrocious* and at times full of really unfortunate tendencies. As a freelance writer I know that it can be tough to write tons of natural-sounding dialogue. This, however, reads like complete crap.Slight spoiler: the game basically starts out in medias res (yeah, you don´t get to create your character, pick gender or skin tone etc) with you running into some military personel who warns you about the Tauren (basically Reavers from Firefly, it seems) being on their way horde-style and that you need to warn your settlement that it is time to pack up and get the hell out.You go back to the village - and refreshingly they aren´t all dead, but have seemingly evacuated en masse already because they got the news from another source. One woman has opted to stay behind because the fishermen are still out and someone needs to warn them. A pretty dire situation and a pretty terrible sacrifice to make, wouldn´t you say?One of the first things you can reply to this is (paraphrased, but pretty accurate): ""So you´re going to be all alone with a bunch of fishermen when their wives are gone, eh?`Seems like the dream of every♥♥♥♥♥♥"".... Yeah, no."

Was looking for a classic fallout style game but the combat system just does not work. The quest is bug ridden and you seem to just ramble for no purpose. One mission saw me talking to a character and trying to raise money to pay him off moved a short distance from him and he and his gang suddenly attack for no reason. Swiftly dealt with them with no effort what so ever. Combat remind weird as you walk past an animal and it ignores you, when you miles past it suddenly turns and decides to attack. You comrades then move all way back across the map leaving you standing about waiting for it to end.Game could be so much more but now would not recomend."
