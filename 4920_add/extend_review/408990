While that phrase gets thrown about a lot,  in this case it is 100% true.    Does that mean this is a bad game?   Depends on what you like and if you are willing to accept the progress that has been made, and understand that there will be no more updates.   Are you still interested?   Then continue reading....In a nutshell, its a challenging base building game that requires attention to detail, managing your villagers, and protecting them from their own stupidity.What there is to like about it...It has a minecraft look and feel about it, blocks with sloped angles.Base building is simple to understand, and allows for infinite creativity when it comes to design.Recipes for crafting are explained ahead of time, no need for research.Definite balance to crafting/fighting/building required,  this creates a true challenge.The musical score is perfect,  varied and rich in sound.It can be fast paced at times, and laid back at other times.What are its problems?Tutorials are crude, almost cryptic.Learning curve is deceptively steep.   You can load it up, play it for a few hours, think you have a handle on it, only to watch your village get wiped within minutes by something you didn't plan for.Building menus and planning menus aren't separated, creating deep menu trees that can confuse players.Noticle hiccups in the camera behavior, terrain fogging over, and the camera diving below the ground level.What is it similar to?Dwarf Fortress, Gnomoria, Stone Hearth,  Anno series, Banished.If you own any of these titles and love the genre, you may want to consider Timber and Stone.   If you've played some of those games, and found it to be tedious, or just not your kinda thing, then pass on Timber and Stone.Things to be concerned about...The game has been abandoned by the developer.   So any bugs listed in the forums or mentioned in this review WILL NOT BE FIXED.    There is are no indications that anyone will take over the development of this game.In conclusion...Given the state of the game, knowing it will never be updated,  this game is worth $5 to $10 tops.   There are youtube videos that show the games content and how it plays in its current build.   Please take the time to watch some videos and consider the price point prior to purchase.In addition, there is also the chance the developer has violated the early access agreement, and this game may be removed from the store page."

Fail at any of these and watch in horror as something simple like a wolf pack kills off all your settlers, or something as extreme as a horde of skeletons following an evil magician burns your world to the ground.Its a slow process of mining rock, shaping it and building it into your massive castle, training settlers to be knights outfited with the best armor and weapons, setting up an economy to trade for resources you dont have, and finally reaching a level of safety and refuge for your lazy/weak/overeating, worthless settlers. Its your choice whether to feed them to wolves, or let them stay in the hopes that maybe they will contribute at some point.The game has a steep learning curve, you will be playing along thinking that your doing fine, then get destroyed because you didnt realize how important feathers were, or maybe you do know how important they are (key ingredient for arrows) but the damn chickens didnt want to shed any. . . either way you can invest a few hours into it, and get wrecked. But if you stick with it (meaning start over and over) for a bit, you will start to feel the satisfaction of successfully raising an army, filling your battlements with archers, polishing up your castle, and building a thriving town. Then let the hordes come, let the goblins chop the forest down, for when they approach your walls, hell will rain down from your archers. And when they charge your gates, greet them with the points of a dozen lances. When the spider monarch shruggs off your arrows, fire balistas at her until she is nothing but crumpled remains.The game is still a work in progress, there are lots of little things that can irritate the crap out of you, but its worth grinding your teeth and working around them.The game is very playable as is, but will only be getting better. The devs have proven their loyalty and dedication to the game and Im very excited for the finished product one day far far from now."

,Recommended,408990,18591700,"Posted: 20 October, 2015",all,Fion,"I played this game even before it arrived on steam. I probably have around 100 hours already. Cause it was super fun.While the game is early access expect bugs and pathfinding problems. Selection of your people is a bit harder then other games, but hopefully you can select multiple at the same time eventually rather then just one cause fighting can get a bit tedious and frustrating.This game is amazing with all its deep building engine and making building seem like a hard long process which building in real life is. I once made a small village and it took so long I felt like everyone mattered and every block placed on my houses felt like an accomplishment in itself. With all the skeletal and goblin bodies outside it trying to get at my villagers. The carnage was great and made me feel like my village was doing its business at keeping out invaders.When I lost just one member of my community I was heart broken cause thats one less villager farming, building, or making Iron tools which helps extremely. And losing someone thats good at making iron tools sucks. Or a good farmer which sucks to. The game makes your choices impact hard. And the best part is you make your own quests, decisions, choices, who gets accepted into the community. The game has lots of things you can already do. Oh and making camps and also item placing is incredible in this game. Place barrels, crates, campfires, and many things all around the place to make your own personalized areas, locations, camps. Lots of things to do.This is just my opinion but the reason I played it this long is because there was no fog of war and bodies never disappeared unless you deleted them or gathered what was on them. Now they disappear without that which disapoints me. These two aspects of the game nailed it for me to keep on playing. As there was no annoying blanket of shadow everywhere which made the environments and your villages look amazing in pictures and just looking at it all in adventurer mode.Although the game itself actually used to be better with no fog of war, and no de-spawning bodies, with battles looking like battlefields. And no dark fog blanket over the world which made pictures and the land looked amazing hopefully they bring these back. Cause honestly its what made me really come back to play this game.I still recommend it but I wish they hadn't taken out two important aspects of the game out that I loved about it. If they do however bring back those two things (No fog of war and no de-spawning bodies) I'm going to be playing it again. Don't be discouraged about this review. Its personal preference with me and these two things might get added back later as options hopefully."
76561197962895391,Not Recommended,408990,19119564,"Posted: 16 November, 2015",all,DirtyHippy,"For a management sim ala DF and others of the genre, this game is, honestly, pretty bad.  I just don't understand how all these people can review a game in development this long so glowingly, when any veteran of this genre can see within a few hours of playing it is exceedingly clunky and lacking in many ways.First let's start with the interface.  UI is important for a game like this since so many decisions require querying a usable interface.  This interface is a throwback from more than a decade ago.  No resizable, movable windows, bizarre, clunky interface patterns, poor fonts, a lack of tooltips, and on an on.  Remove a designation?  Alt-Shift and click!  Obviously!  You will buy the game anyway, because you are a sucker for this genre like I am.  And you will say ""Well, that dude was right.""Management of the AI is a lesson in frustration.  Each settler may only have one job activated at a time, and if you want to change a job on a settler, it requires a few clicks to manually change.  If you are a veteran of these genres, you certainly are wondering, ""Why don't I just set the priorities for my jobs so if no orders are present for a higher priority job, I will fallback to a lower priority one?""  This doesn't exist.  One of the most fundamental concepts for this genre and it is absent.  Be prepared to be pausing and clicking until you have carpal tunnel.  You will be spending hours changing jobs on settlers as priorities shift until enough immigrants have arrived to fill your basic needs without switching them manually. At that point you will just leave your core settlers at their jobs even when they idle, because the idea of switching them manually anymore brings tears to your eyes.There is no concept of hauling between stockpiles.  All stockpiles appear to be magical entities that transport goods across the map.  So if your farmer puts food in his nearby stockpile, someone else can grab it out of his magical stockpile four levels down immediately.  Who needs stockpile optimization in this type of game anyway?  Sigh.Combat is god awful.  Since there is not really any military organization whatsoever, when you get attacked by the three or four types of NPC groups that exist, you will need to pause, change the jobs of your settlers to soldiers / archers, and then basically micromanage them by constant moving and pausing until the fight is over.  Things get a bit better once you grow large enough, as you generally have full-time soldiers, but you will still need to micro them for battles of any size.  At that point you just draft any new immigrants into your undead army because there isn't much else for them to do.Pathfinding and job fulfillment still have fundamental issues.  You will have to constantly manually path settlers so they resume what they were doing.  Want your archer to train?  Sure he will train, for a while, until he wanders off to upgrade or eat, or whatever.  After that, if he is not right next to the training dummies, he will just idle at your meeting hall.  You will need to click on him and move him back manually to his training dummies.  Get used to it - you will spend most of your game doing this in some form or another.  How does a game that has been in development for four years still have fundamental issues with the foundation on which everything else is built?There is no point to building anything other than walls and doors.  The screenshots from the store page?  Pointless.  There are no prefab buildings and there are no game mechanics that encourage you to build them manually.  These buildings were constructed (very, very slowly and tediously), for absolutely no purpose other than a screenshot.  There is no concept of housing, or rooms, or even sleeping other than recovering from wounds.  Your settlers seem to work 24/7, they have no moods, or desires (other than food), or quirks (meaningful in this context anyway).  There are no socialization, mood, beauty, recreation, weather, seasons, temperature, or any other such mechanics expected from this genre.I played the game until day 35-40 or so, had almost every profession maxed (except for engineering, which is impossibly slow to level), had a slew of fully kitted soldiers and archers, and frankly found the game quite easy.  Any veteran of these games would find it that way.  As long as you micro combat and retreat wounded settlers, there is really no danger unless you get unlucky in the first few weeks.I have many, many games in my library, and I have never felt compelled to post a review until now.  I love this genre and wanted to love this game, but it just is not there and I'm not sure it ever will be, early access or not.  Do yourself a favor and grab Rimworld, or Gnomoria, or just re-download DF for the tenth time.  Thank me later."

I've played Timber and Stone since the earliest alpha release and have always enjoyed the balancing act required between military and economic development required to survive. Train your villagers in different professions and craft ever-better items and equipment to grown and defend your place in the world.But as your settlement grows, don't be surprised if you attract unwanted attention. A host of invaders will try and annihilate you just for daring to settle where they don't want you!Despite the initially relaxed pace, things can certainly become hectic as your settlement, and the invasions, become more complex."

Be prepared though; this game does have a bit of a steep learning curve, but is worth it! The best way to describe this game is putting Minecraft, Banished, and some other games together (build farms, build buildings, make tools/weapons, defend your settlement, build armor/weapons, get resources, etc.) You also trade with a trader than comes in; to do so you need to build roads to the edge of the map (build in all directions from your townhall); these roads also allow immigrants to join your settlement every so often. It's pretty cool that you can build buldings pretty much anyway you want provided you have the materials.You also have to designate each type of worker; you can do this by pressing U and then assining them different tasks. The maps are HUGE if you select large; I'm amazed by how large it is. The most important thing about this game is it's a blast to play; just be prepared to learn everything as you go; it's not that difficult once you start to understand you need to assign your workers, etc.The game will automatically pause if one or more of your workers is in range of a goblin, wolf, etc. This is a good thing.. This allows you to unpause if your think your fine, or press U and jump to the worker that is in trouble. On the top of the screen in the beginning you can click on resources, click on each resource, and build the stock level to a certain level (of course you'll need materials, but the game remembers what you set it to.).Be sure to go to options once you're in the game and change the scrolling speed when you move your mouse around; by default it's setup pretty slow, and also increase the draw distance.This game is one of my favorites now that I'm figuring it out; keep in mind this game is more for adults whom have played other strategy games. I wouldn't recommend this for kids as it's a bit of a steep learning curve, but you can teach them as well."

Its worth the purchase now - its fully playable and I know I will certainly get 20 hours out of it as-is just trying to build bigger and better settlements. Yes, there are a few bugs and it needs to be optimized, but nothing is gamebreaking.To me thislookslikeMinecraftandplayslikeGnomoria.I love the fully rotate-able 3D nature and camera. Lots of fun to be had. Lots of learning about what works and how to build something successfull.Pros:+Lots of content, even now.+Totally fun - and after 3 or so hours, I haven't even really built many structures or even entered into combat proper.+The tutorial is good enough, and lets you have access to it while you are playing your own game. You can turn it off, but it is built in a way that it can just as easily be used as a manual of sorts.+Graphics are quaint.+I get alot out of city builder/dwarf management sims, and this is the price point that I want. I want to encourage devs to really have the resources to do the job right, without totally breaking the bank for me. I always felt eight bucks was too little forGnomoria.Cons:-The menu system is good as-is, but I'd like an 'overview' menu showing how many people are doing what. A 'meta' menu if you will (which may actually be that 'statistics' button that isn't implemented yet.-This game is apparently being built where, on a long enough timeline, everybody's settlement crumbles. I'm fine with this - DF style, but not all are.

It's a challenging city builder/worker management game; sort of like if Minecraft and Banished had a baby.. it would be this game.The game is very addicting and until you are able to attract migrants to your town it is very challenging to fend off enemies while keeping your town going and growing.I love that I can design any building any way that I want out of any materials that I want and place objects anywhere in those buildings that I want. It's wonderful! I also like that I can zoom in and first person move through the town that I just built (a first person mode would be great, or POV from the workers would be cool too)I like that I can pick and choose what objects (tools, materials, weapons, etc.) I can watch or what I don't watch by adding them to the side screen. (It would be nice if you could just click on the logo of the object you are watching and bring up the ""track/buy/sell"" box too instead of having to scroll through the menus).What I would like to see though is:-The ability to breed domestic livestock-Respawning and/or the ability to grow berry bushes... it seems once you harvest all the berry bushes in the game, they don't grow back or take a very long time to do so if they do..-It would also be nice if the developer would create a ""delete"" tool or make it more user friendly for deleting stuff. I find deleting any object, wall, designated area (mining/building), military patrol routes, or roads is sort of all over the place and it would be nice to see one single tool for all of that stuff. Right now if you want to delete a road/designated area it is shift+alt+click (highlighted area) to delete.  To delete objects or objects that are designated to be built you just click on them and the option comes up to delete them. To delete a military patrol route you also click on it and you can delete the whole route or the last placed point. If I could just right click the mousekey and highlight an area for objects and all to be deleted that would be much easier.-An easier way to cycle through workers instead of individually clicking on them one at a time.All in all I bought 3 games one day about a week ago and I've only played this one.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I am updating my review to add that this game is VERY CHALLENGING. I definitey rage quit it a couple of times, but if that's what you're looking for than this is the game for you. In stating that, I would also like to see a force save option since there is only auto save and it won't help you if you're getting your butt kicked and want to go back and see what you can do differently at an earlier point in the game.

It's almost like a Minecraft colony sim. That being said... it is very unfinished, and sadly abandoned... as seems to be a trend with these types of games on Steam for some reason. The AI is very buggy, and you quickly run out of things to do once you have your basic defenses and base up and running. I was pushing it with my 15 hours hoping for something that just isn't there. Since it's abandoned, I cannot reccommend it. Are there any games like this that aren't being abandoned? Aside from StoneHearth and Rimworld, I can't think of any.

The problem is this game has been abandoned and was never finished.  The AI is very hard to control and you constantly are losing your settlers.  If you aren't paying close attention one of them will wonder off, end up on the other end of the map and get killed.  Which is a big deal as if you lose more then a couple you'll soon be over run by the creature spawns in the game.  The controls are also chucky and were never polished.  When you add in the pathing bugs. the crashes it just becomes unplayable after a while.

There's quite a number of options for building too - too many to go into in a review, but think minecraft on a larger scale, at the moment they only have square blocks, but some of the basic terrain tools have triangles, slopes etc - I'm sure the other building type shapes will come into play soon.So far they have wolves, goblins and skeletons as enemies, The skeletons are by far the worst if accompanied by a necromance, as he just raises what you kill unless you wipe him out first ... but without going into too many spolers for the game - Yes, it's well worth the price even at this early stage, and I fully recommend anyone to buy it and try it out."

This is very useful, especially when first starting out when you do not have enough settlers to cover all jobs, or some jobs are not in high demand and the settler is idled.  Being able to change the camera angle with the mouse is much nicer than only being able to view in 4 angles.  The angling of ramps/roofing allows for some nice designing freedom when making structures.My only complaint, so many people like to compare this game to Minecraft! Stop the insanity!

Yes I know the developers hit a standstill and the game it not being updated due to funds. but this game is still really enjoyable. Heres my pros and cons of what I think about it.Pros:A good ammount of blocks to build withA good economyAble to run in the background (For when it gets a little too boring for you but you want to progress)Good visuals (Hey the characters arn't minecraft looking!)tests your resource management skills.Free camera! (For when you want to see at NPC eye level and explore the houses you created)DomesticationGood ammount of roles your citizens can fill.F*CKING BALLISTAS, WHO DOESNT WANT THEM?A good ammount of craftable resources to keep your citizens buisy.Enemies to give the game some combat.Freedom to create whatever kind of building you want.Randomly generated maps.Settlers have their own personality (Example like settlers can have good traits like ""Brave"" or ""fast learner"" and bad traits like ""Lazy"" and ""bad vision"")Merchants come and go often so you can get whatever seeds you do not have from them or replenish rare supplies even sell some overstock supplies (Like all that quality dirt you have lying about).When in the background (Or when currently looking at the screen) the game will pause at an event like someone died or a hostile has been spotted and displayed at the bottom of the screen. (It has saved my town many times)Cons:The map is a bit shallow when not in mountians. It's only 5 blocks deep including dirt, would love for it to go a bit deeper      and for ores to get richer the deeper you go.You can (And whill when new to the game) not properly manage resources and fail to be able to create more tools thus practically ending your playthrough early.One wolf/Goblin/skele/spider is good dame but get 2 or more can and will kill your town. (I have had it where a pack of 3 wolves killed my guards then♥♥♥♥♥♥♥the town soon after)Getting settlers is a slow process, little too slow in my mind.Not many terrians. there are supposed to be more than hills/mountians/grasslands/water as said on the big map.Tutorial is kind of a joke.Not too many blocks to build with.Blacksmith and engineer level progression is really low thanks to lack of things for them to do.music gets annoying, theres very little of it, plus it's very generic.What I think the game needs when development picks back up on it (If it does):More blocks.Dyes and plain blocks to make the town pretty! (Or for you people, create pixel art)More terrians.More diversity on how the people look.children, to grow your town that way.more modernised weaponry, just like muskets, crossbows, cannons, that kind of stuff.Overall I enjoy the game."

They dont feel cold, bored, stressed. As far as i know they only get hungry when you lack of food and get scared when fighting against monsters. They dont need to sleep unless they are injured.4-) Defensive ConstructionBuilding is kinda slow in this game. I dont think that is a problem but when you build a wall for example, to protect your village; you must put a door on that wall aswell. And it must be atleast a braced door to make defenses strong. In early phase of game, finding and processing minerals are hard to manage. Therefore building a braced door requires an effort. But when a little goblin come and destroy your braced door in a matter of seconds, that is truely annoying."

You seem to be locked into the square that you start on, no exploring, no finding odd treasures (massive dungeons in minecraft). A bit sad considering there is a random map generator and you should be able to get a squad together to go explore.2. UI is worse than dog food. Seriously, everything is hidden away in obscure places and you basically have to memorize what needs what to be built. Basically feels extremely incomplete and like the dev team were about to publish the game and realised: ""Oh we need a UI!"".3.

But I also kind of hated it. And here is why: When it goes to its core features it basically is minecraft from a different perspective. You have your eight settlers that found themself a place to live. And every settler can be assigned to do different jobs. Over time you will gather ressources that are mainly food, hide and more, loot, wood and stone. Over time you will build up your own little settlement to be a small fortress, castle, village or whatever it may be. It is all up to you. And that is where this game shines as bright as two of the games I dearly love. Minecraft and Terraria.You can be as creative as you want to be and build what you want to build. Of course you have to rely on ingame features and objects, but that is how the other two games are just as well. Other than that, you can build up your castle with a dungeon below. You can build a village with an escapetunnel within your selfmade Well. Whatever it may be, your settlement can look how you want it to look like.But this game would be too easy if it was just that. I mean, where does the loot come from? You can get attacked by the wildlife, spiders, skelletons, goblins and probably a few other things as well. And if you dont have your settlers geared and leveled that can mean that your settlement is about to get its *quack* pushed in.This game, a mix out of AoE and Minecraft, is still worth the money for what you get ingame. It offers alot already and since it aint over in just 2 minutes it can go on for quite a long time. It also offers a lot of replayability. Have you built your castle and you are satisfied? How about a speedrun in which you do everything you just did, but much faster? How about a run where non of your setters die? The possibilities may be limited but they surely wont end after just 5 sessions.If you really want this game, buy it. I think its worth the money. If you are unsure, then wait until it comes up in a sale."

,Recommended,408990,19523614,"Posted: 6 December, 2015",all,Crossmas,"I'm a fan of games like Gnomoria, Terraria, Craft the World and so on, so I really enjoy playing Timber and Stone. I think you can compare it best to Gnomoria. You control your little people and let them farm, build, mine and fight to build up your own empire. It is early access so there are a few graphic bugs, which can be annoying, but they don't make the game unplayable.Pros:+ I really like the calm soundtrack. It is no such melody which is getting annoying after you heard it several hours of gaming. :3+ The graphics are lovely, but I think there could be more types of roofs, walls, etc. And I would be pleased if there would be some kind of window like in every other game you can produce glas out of sand, so why not here, too?+ The building system is working better than I expected. For example in Gnomoria you have to build a little floor on top of a block before the gnomes can walk on it, that's why I was a little bit concered about this game, but I didn't got disappointed. In fact the building system is simple.+ The crafting system is also simple, because the little fellows tell you why they can't craft something :D I experienced a lot of games where they just stand there you have to guess what is wrong with them, but the little speech bubble is more than I ever wished for ;DCons:- The performance of the game is horrible. My CPU is a bit older, but that doesn't mean, that this game needs the whole performance of it. After a few new migrants the game is running on 20 to 30fps and sometimes it's driving me nuts. I guess it is a problem with the programming of the pathfinding, because I noticed some situations, where the little fellows where thinking abouth ""pathfinding"" for a few seconds(!) and the game was running really bad in these moments.- In my opinion the map is too small in height. In a game like this, where you need ore for nearly everything, it can not be, that you can only mine like 5 blocks under the ground.- The tutorial could be more ""intensive"". At first I was like ""cool, there are little messages at the side of the screen, which tell me what to do"", but I had to realise quickly that some information is missing and then you don't know, what to do next. Which brings me to my next point. For example when you press ""U"" there is a list of all your fellows and you can easily switch between their jobs.- A sandbox mode is missing. In my opinion in a game like this, it is very important to have a sandbox mode, where you can learn the game without getting run over by enemies after a few (ingame) days. It took me like 5 games until I knew what I have to do and now I'm not dying anymore. But for beginners this can be very frustrating and takes the fun out of the game.- I quickly reached the point where I unlocked all the skills for making the weapons, armor and other craftings and the game was only like getting new migrants and making my empire bigger. This was the point where the game got a little bit boring.- There is something like a skill map missing, where you can see which job can do which craftings at every level. It can be very frustrating when you have to search for the unlocked craftings everytime. Also you don't find out what the benefit is from having a level 20 farmer or builder.- And then there are the graphic bugs, but this is no big deal. It is only the light which isn't getting displayed correctly.Although I think the cons are massive, the game is really fun to play, when you are into game types like this. Don't get mislead by all the negative points which I listed before. The beginning can be hard, but if you take the time you get into the gameplay and so it can be an enjoyable gametime."

The reviews which state that the game requires better balancing are not necessarily wrong, but the developers have said that the game does not have an Easy dificulty setting.  Therefore the seemingly endless wave after wave of NPC's that are being mentioned are not entirely true.  Things do ramp up the further you go in the game, but I do believe it is based on your number of settlers.You start with 8 Settlers and grow from there, which in turn increases the risk you have of being attacked by more numbers of NPCs which will be discouraging at first but when you start to adapt and strategize your attacks when neccessary it is a fine balance the way it currently is.TL:DR - Buy it."

The game works smoothly on my computer (not a MAC) and for as many hours as I have played I have only encountered 3 crashes.  Every game is different and there are endless possibilities as to what and how you design.  Tutorial is pretty lame but anyone that has ever played any kind of a build game should be able to figure out what needs to be done.You start the game with a few items and with 8 people, these 8 people will have to work their butts off to get materials for crafting more tools and other items.  Some of these people will become farmers and foragers to keep all in food and other staples.  Miners, tree choppers and builders working to build your walls and floors.  Stone masons to craft tools and other items, tailors to make twine into cloth, into light armours.  Capenters to build weapons, workbenches, supply crates.  Blacksmiths to craft ores into ingots, forge weapons, coins, lighting fixtures.  More professions also but these are just some with a few of the things they can do.Once you build a hall and connect a road to 1-4 edges of the world you will have merchants arrive to buy and sell merchandise also once you have a road connection you will have migrants arrive seeking admittance.  I usually build a stairway 4-6 high and put down an upper foor that I then make into a hall and build my roads to the edges so that a 2 wide road is level and wide enough for a merchant to travel upon.Here is the CON I find most irritating:  Once I manage to get around 25 people in my community the game starts to lag.Why this game is in Early Access I have no clue as it is (IMO) completely playable as is.  It has the building, the crafting, the farming, even killing the ememies that wander around.  It is very challenging to play as I said earlier, every game is different.

It's not random. You pick and choose the land you start on and see whether it has enough animals/trees/ores/etc. in it. You just have to be smart on where you build your town, or whether you have a basic 3 blocks high wall to keep the monsters out and whether you were smart enough to have a kill zone for your archers and had EVERYONE carry a weapon and actually acted like a militia.

,Not Recommended,408990,18744969,"Posted: 29 October, 2015",all,Deterbeest,"This review used to be a recommendation, with words of caution added later on. It's been a while since then, and I feel I have to change this review to ""not recommended"", if only to balance out the people who recommend it after a couple of hours of play. Don't get me wrong: discovering how the game works is fun, but after that it just falls flat and the grinding quickly becomes unbearable (to me at least). If you're the type of gamer that goes ""well I got 20 hrs of play out of a €10,- game, so excellent value"", you might still want to buy this. But with games like these, I'm looking for an interesting sandbox experience with a lot of replayability, and that's just not the case yet with Timber & Stone.Since the release on Steam, the devs have fallen almost completely silent, and everything points to development being halted indefinitely. Player complaints (either about the game itself or the lack of communication) are ignored (except by a few diehard fans who attack people for being critical) and that's basically two of the biggest sins for an ""early access"" title.So. Unless you don't mind ""wasting"" a bit of money for a couple of hours of fun (and aftert that, likely disappointment), avoid this title in favor of early access builders that DO have an active developer behind it.(1.7 Steam release review)My most recent settlement, called ""False New Hope"" (it seemed appropriate after the first few settlements I started got wiped before I even managed to build a decent town hall), fell to a horde of goblins that almost thanked me for building so many nice gates to smash through. Next time, I'm building a citadel with just one gate, and it will be heavily defended.If you like games that mercilessly ramp up the difficulty with every small accomplishment you make, that require you to plan ahead for threats you don't even know about yet, that give you quite a lot of options to do so but don't hold your hand at any time, Timber & Stone is for you.At this point, the interface is still quite clunky and unintuitive (well, to me at least) and there seem to be some balancing issues that could lead to frustration. Be prepared to do a lot of reading up to get started properly. On the plus side, the forums and developers seem to be very active, so I'm sure things will improve in the future. The devs also seem to have plenty more new features up their sleeve, so I don't expect to get bored with this anytime soon.Just be careful that your archers don't shoot their friends.EDIT: after more playing, and following the forums for a bit, I feel like I need to update this review:- development actually seems to be halted now, with very little communication from the developers on the forums, except for vague and slightly defensive posts indicating it's ""temporary"". No plans for the future have been announced since releasing the game on Steam, aside from a few remarks on feature requests (either to dismiss them, or to confirm that they're planned, whatever that means when nothing seems to be happening development-wise)- once you figure out the mechanics and get a handle on the clunky controls, the game isn't very deep yet. A few tech levels and a handful of enemies that become increasingly numerous and a bit tougher as your settlement grows and becomes richer/more advanced- I spent a good amount of time on it, while having fun, but a lot of it was getting to grips with the game's weirdness and grindyness (""teching up"" is largely dependend on finding enough appropriate ores or repeatedly building the same objects over and over again)- now that it looks like I won't be encountering fresh challenges, my urge to play is largely absent because of poor controls (both for building and for managing large numbers of settlers/soldiers), low fps and general annoyances (i.e. archers shooting their infantry buddies half the time, having to manually click individual enemies to target them and then again to loot their corpses)- judging by the people running ""old"" settlements with intricate, large builds and big populations, some gamers will obviously still find it worth their time despite the aforementioned shortcomings. I guess it depends on how much time you're willing to spend, whether you're a hardcore builder or not, etc.- in short: this game will probably still entertain you for a few good days if you're into survival/crafting/base building, but there's a good chance it'll start to disappoint further down the line, with little in the way of a development plan (even one without specific promises and deadlines) to keep you interested"

But this is not the (main) reason why I give my positive / negative recommendation (I will come back to this review and change that if necessary and also edit / add to my written part, as new editions come out).I'll post what I found out (and my own thoughts, but based on facts) as bullet points next, take them as positive or negative, that's up to everyone's taste (at least to some part).First off, some general info:This game project has originally started as a Kickstarter (Sep 26 2012 - Oct 26 2012) - 3,368 backers pledged $88,577of $50,000 goal.This is a one-person project (""Robert""), who says (on the Kickstarter ""about the creator"" page) that he is a self-taught artist / programmer with no formal education in those areas.The screenshots of the game on the Kickstarter page show very blocky graphics (trees and terrain) - this has improved drastically since then, overall I like the graphics very much (although I have all settings on their highest levels with so far no major performance issues, and that running on three monitors AKA triple-head - however, I have a high-end gaming system - latest Intel CPU, 32 GB RAM, ROG mobo and a GTX Titan X).The dev's stance is to not post any timeline of milestones and in general is vague / unsure when and what new features will be implemented.The dev's overall stance is that the project / game will never be finished as such, which means that either he'll continue working on it for as long as his health allows him to, or that he will just stop working on it whenever he feels like it - this was supposedly a commend he made, plus ""Robert""'s signature slogan on the forum is ""Art is never finished, only abandoned. -Leonardo da Vinci"".Which by itself is not necessarily something that should raise concern, however it took six (6) months for the latest update (v1.7), despite that the majority has requested in a poll made mid-2013 to receive updates every two to three weeks.There's an outdated ""dev roadmap"" from Aug this year (2015) posted on the website's forum (again, not on Steam, as the dev, ""Robert"", refuses to interact with ""the Steam community"" / to post on Steam) for up to v1.7 (the current release). The last post from someone was made in mid-October asking for what's next and when, with no response almost a month later.Posting on the forum attimberandstonegame.comrequires creating an account, which requires email verification that is sent to the email address entered during registration - I, for my part, never received that email. Trying to log in only displays that I need to contact the forum administrator, but no link / email address is displayed and as a result I can not do.As a result, reading posts is possible without log-in to an active account on the site's forum, but posting there is not possible.Game mechanics related:However, blocks and ""float"" and as such, there is no physics (at least no gravity) in the game - all moving objects (creatures) are bound to the ground (or swim in water), but trees, if dug underneath, can ""float"", AKA ""minecraft experience"".From what I could gather, the ""end game"" mechanics have changed from version to version (at least from the previous 1.6 to this latest one, 1.7) - right now, and this seems to be the stance of the dev ""Robert"", is that, due to more and more enemies and stronger ones spawn as in-game time passes, eventually all your virtual people in the game will get killed and you will have to start all over again.I have read that there is a mod out that can change that (or at least it has difficulty settings), but AFAIK that mod is not maintained by the dev and as such might not work anymore when a newer version of the game is released and if the mod dev ceases to update the mod to keep it working with newer versions of the game.The path-finding is quite good, and you can have events displayed to various degrees that you can define, also you can have the thoughts / responses  of your virtual displayed, to help you understand and react to if something doesn't work or if there's something you need to change, according to a situation.You select what every few of the virtual person should focus on (their profession) but you don't have to (but you can, to a certain level but it works well) what every single one should actually be doing at any given point in time. Yet even though, you have to switch around professions quite often, to satisfy supply and demand of resources and tools required. Which in the end does result in quite a bit of micro-management (note: the dev stated that the professions will be replaced with a skills system, to reduce / eliminate micro-management - which was supposed to have happened already in this current version, 1.7).You can manually set a location for a virtual person to move to and then, if set correctly / accordingly, will perform its actions there (they perform actions as per their set profession and closest to their current location). That way you have quite a high amount of control, if needed, to prioritize where work should be performed.There is a few things here and there, but this is overall what the game is about.Verdict:Overall, if you're looking for a game where you can temporarily build a virtual civilization and design somewhat interesting structures via A LOT OF micro-managing, no physics (AKA floating in mid-air of trees and other resources) and time-pressure due to getting attacked in steady intervals and by increasingly stronger opponents (some have complained that they get too strong too soon, AKA the game has a too high of a difficulty level - but again, there's currently a working mod for that) to the point of where they will overwhelm and extinguish your virtual civilization and you then have to start all over again - then this is the game for you.So basically, if you don't mind restarting over again after a few hours (but that is dependent on how long you pause the game) and overall a fairly steep difficulty (at least without mod) then this is a game for you. If you look for something where you don't have to do that, then this is not the game for you.However, if you want to focus on designing block-by-block and manually building interesting virtual structures and keep those as long as you wish, but you lack the ability to build a virtual civilization and as such you are doing all the work yourself, in first-person - and, AFAIK, no physics (AKA floating trees and parts of trees and terrain) - then you're better off with something like Minecraft. Or ""7 Days to Die"" (which has physics but that can be buggy, yet so far not game-breaking and still gives hours and hours of fun).So my recommendation (or lack of it) is based on all of the above - again, this might change from version-to-version."

Take the 12 wolves scenario spoken of earlier, clicking on a nearly dead unit trying to pull them out of combat; you click and click and the mouse random moves to the middle of the screen and your command click was ignored...ouchie~Path-finding: Major work needed here. Not really noticeable at the beginning of the game but reach day 50 odd on a large map and your frame-rate will have gone from XXX to XX and no one can seem to do anything without bumping into each other and stopping. Mining/Building path-finding will comically often trap the settler on a single block in mid-air. Funny at day 10, not so much by day 90Frame-rate: Start of the game, I was at triple figures. I am now on my second map (I died horribly at day 22 on the first map, RIP Rugolas; you died a Spartan) at day 93 and it's struggling to stay above 50 - assuming path-finding is the cause.Particle effects cause discos; this has to be seen to be understood...------As this is early access, I would expect these cons to be fixed but hell, adding more content (blocks, décor, workshops, tech) and I wouldn't even care.

Once you're day 40+ in the game can quickly grind to a hault. Sure you loose a few people, it happens, it sucks, but try recovering....Here's the problem:1) Your troop AI is stupid, for lots of reasons mentioned. Let alone non-combat townfolk who appear to be suicidal. So they easily get slaughtered.2) You can't keep your troops together, so they easily get slaughtered.3) You can't put them on a specific patrol route, to try to keep them together, so they easily get slaughtered.4) You can't escort new villagers who come into the area, so they get slaughtered. And now you can't rebuild your population.5) You can't escort traders, so they get slaughtered. And now your economy crumbles.Essentially, because the combat AI is so poor the game hits a total roadblock. I managed to get up to 12 townfolk. Learned that you need an army, built it up, trained it (5 guys, nice armor, all lvl 11+ infrantry), and because of all the above randomness dropped down to 2.Thankfully my core tradesman are safe inside the walls, but with only two guards left they'll only be that way until the next necromancer comes to town since I can no longer get citizens to come my town safely.In short, the game is lots of fun at first, then you're toast unless you enjoy micro-micro-micro managing (e.g. pause the game, set your troop movement for a few tiles, play, pause, rinse-repeat)."

I do have to warn you, though: if you're expecting to build a beautiful city with grand architecture, drop that expectation. You'll be spending time on building walls, chokepoints, and training facilities to keep everyone alive. Don't expect it to be an easy game as well -- your villagers won't always be the kind of people you'd want in your village, but that's the least of your worries. You'll have to defend your village against waves and waves of wolves, goblins, skeletons, spiders, and a lot more.All in all, it is indeed a very exciting (albeit slow) game, as you'll always be on the edge of your seat when the monsters flood into your settlement."

The AI can be stupid.This game is so hard that you will die alot and need to start over,cause the game auto saves and you can't make new saves.      RogueLike all the way.NO OPTIONS like Normal,Hard or even easy.You will find that this game needs them.as its stuck on ironman.The game lags like it needs a beast of a pc or something....and that i have.(lag is due to enemy/pathing.fire,AI getting stuck,shadows,large maps,etc,etc)The settlers are so weak,the only thing they can kill(most the time) without dying is a spider with a clubYou will be in no armor,no swords and dudes will spawn and just run threw your base/camp or whatever you got from day 1 onward.By my 5th or 6th game in row i was annoyed and flat out p!ssed.The best tip i can say is don't even mess with a wall at first...dig 2 or 3 blocks down around a nice chuck of land to build in.Then walls.The UI NEEDS SOME LOVEDay 3 lost due to 6 wolfs...clubs did nothing.Day 10 lost due to goblin with bow,shortswords did nothingDay 20 lost due to starvation,no ideaDay 31 Lost due to people getting stuck and goblins+some other kinda skelly or something.Day 25 Lost due to goblin FIRE ARROWS buring down my STONE WALLS??!!! WTFDay 8...uninstalled.why you ask...well a game where fire burns down stone walls is umm...garbage,I do love the idea and look of the game,but lack of polish,save games,and such hard enemy is a bit much.I may still play even tho the game became MODWARE, but i would not want someone to buy it till it has way more stuff and some fixes.IF you do buy it i would go to the games main website and DL the cheat mod. sounds lame,but this game is all cute but it gets nasty off the rip.But for EA its pretty good so far,other then fire buring ground and STONE WALLS.Walls=lifeTrench/moat=lifeThe way the game scales is garbage.Fire buring holes in the map and stone walls imo is a no-no and made me put this game on the shelf and move on..not gonna update this at all ever.I think the game has been givin up on..."

With potential to improve greatly.--> Feel free to leave a comment if you have played both Stonehearth and this game, I am curious how similar they are."

I do not know. This game had a lot of promise, and I am sad.======The Bad======The learning curve is very steep on this game, and the wiki is rather sparse, so you'll have to look for videos on Youtube to get you started.=======The Good=======But after you get through that hump.... Oh boy, this game is Uber addictive. I haven't played a game that made me go ""Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's 6am already??"" since Civilization 4.My tips on starting the game:1) Choose a start with a healthy amount of Chickens, Trees, and Copper.2) At the beginning of each game, make sure you have one dedicated Miner, Farmer, Builder. These settlers can take on dual roles: Woodcutter/Carpenter, Forager/Herder, StoneMason/Blacksmith/Engineer. Later on you will need a Tailor.3) Build 2 layer walls around your settlement ASAP. ESPECIALLY around your Livestock Pen.4) More food will invite more settlers as long as your road connects your hall to the edge of the map.5) Have a dedicated army.6) Have one or two city gates tops. More gates = more guards required.======The Ugly======To the Developers, hats of to you guys for creating such a wonderful game. This game looks like it can be a winner if your marketing team can get the word out and get more eyes looking at your game. A google search for the game shows up outdated graphics, so you guys need to get out there and change that so people see the updated textures.However, there are some criticisms I hope you guys will take note of:i) The ores in the game are too spread out. I wish they were clumped up more in veins like DF. I keep getting slaughtered past day 30 because the enemies do way too much damage to me. I could hardly get enough metals to make stuff in my 80+ Iron start. All I had I crafted into tools which eventually broke. Not enough for Weapons and Armour. It's kinda embarrasing to keep using clubs.ii) Drawbridges!!!! PLSiii) I wish there was an ability to group Settlers into squads so that I can have more control of them going into battle. Right now they just make a beeline and the first guy who gets there tends to get slaughtered.iv) Depth limit is too low.v) A gamma setting in game would be great. I don't have a very good monitor so it is really hard to see during the night cycle.Again, great work guys. What a fantastic game. Now excuse me while I attempt fix my sleep schedule."

,Recommended,408990,22495981,"Posted: 18 April, 2016",all,Ikke,"Many recent reviews are negative because the game is abandoned. This may be true, or not, but it's safe to say that the game's development process is erratic and unpredictable, and communication from the devs is bad to nonexistent.However, even with the possibility that there will be no further updates to the game, I still think at its current price of 12 bucks it's worth buying. The game itself is deep, challenging, fairly complex, and it lets you build creatively. For an early access title it feels quite polished and I haven't noticed any serious balance or gameplay issues (some minor quirks here and there but the game is very playable). I've very much enjoyed the time I've spent with the game, and even if there are no further updates I don't regret buying it.Note: I generally turn down or disable combat, since I prefer to just play the creative game. Check some other reviews or the forum if you want to get a better idea of how combat works in this game.Granted, it still has a lot of untapped potential, and with the way it's looking right now it will most likely remain untapped, but despite that I still feel like this is a good game and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the genre."

,Not Recommended,408990,19560468,"Posted: 7 December, 2015",all,TimeTravelAstronaut,"While tagged as a City Builder, Timber and Stone fits more closely into the ""Stay alive as long as possible"" genre, with games like Dwarf Fortress and Gnomoria. This game is attempting to kill your settlers and destroy your settlement, although the simulation isn't especially complex in its current state, so most of your failures will come from your ineptitude as an Administrator of your settlement rather than the sort of incredible disasters you may encounter in a game like Dwarf Fortress. A 3rd party mod exists to disable enemies and make the game more forgiving, but by it's nature this isn't a traditional city-builder in the vein of Simcity.Despite the fact that I've only listed cons, I've enjoyed my time with this game; I consider these to be things that may turn you off as a potential player who is used to this genre of game, but will likely improve during development.Going with the assumption that this Early Access title continues to be improved upon, and you find the cons tolerable in the game's current state, I can reccomend purchasing this game.Cons:- Many, many things are not explained in-game. You can learn much more about the game by visiting the Official Forums or the Reddit community on r/TimberAndStone.- Stockpile management does not exist beyond increasing your maximum capacity. Once a resource is placed in a stockpile it is available at all other stockpiles of the same type. Simply place all the relevant stockpiles next to a workshop and your Settler can craft without interruption.- Settlers can only perform a single job, and will not switch jobs unless you do so manually. Until you amass a larger number of Settlers this means a large amount of micromanagement switching Settlers between jobs to keep production moving forward.- Food production is currently very unbalanced. Livestock are incapable of breeding and produce resources at a considerably slower rate than the Farmer. Likewise, the fisherman will often wander outside the safety of your settlement  to find what he deems is an ideal fishing spot which means he also generates resources slower than the farmer. The Farmer is the only job that can reliably feed your entire settlement and generate a surplus to attract new Settlers.- Your Settlers have little depth. They eat only when starving, sleep only when injured, never drink, and require no shelter. A relatively safe job like the Farmer could potentially live their entire life never sleeping a wink, and never abandoning their post assuming there's always work for them to do.- Many Jobs have a shortage of tasks to do. As they gain experience from crafting items, some jobs (notably the blacksmith and engineer) will have nothing to do but craft low-level recipes, break the item down, and craft it again. Other jobs will have an abundance of work in the beginning, then become much less relevant as time goes on.- Currently the only enemies in the game are Wolves, Goblins, Skeletons, and Spiders. 2 other special types exist, but don't appear nearly as often.- There is no passive method of base defence currently. Even high level doors will only delay enemies briefly, and no trap system is currently implemented. One of the most effective ways to deal with attacks is to force enemies to follow a winding path to your gate while being pelted by archers.- Settlers will commonly let you know why they won't perform a task, but there's no feedback about what is actually causing the issue. As an example, a Builder will comment there's no Timber available for a construction job, but he won't comment that there's no carpenter in your Settlement to actually make him the timber. This means things can sit in your queue that can go unnoticed for some time.- It feels like steps are missing from some items in the crafting system. All settlers eat raw food, and get the same nourishment from it. Weapons and armor have no intermediate ingredients, simply various combinations of ingots and textiles. For the most part this takes away from the sense of production chains in your Settlement.12/1/2016:   I've changed this review to not be reccomended, as development has largely ceased and in its current state is not worth the price; the game is unfinished."

,Not Recommended,408990,23396842,"Posted: 5 June, 2016",all,Parmaham,"Edit: Wrote this review more then a year ago when I was still enthusiastic about the game and saw all the potential it had. More the a year passed and nothing happend. No updates, no new content, no nothing. This game is defininetly a great early-acces game IF IT WOULD BE WORKED ON. But if the current state of the game is the endproduct, then it's not really amazing. I mean the game itself it's good, but you can clearly notice that it is still an unfinished game. Sure you can still have some fun with it, but be aware you're buying an unfinished game.Original review (when the game was still worked on):First of all I have to say this is a very good game. It has a lot of strategy in it and is fun to play.BUT there is also a lot to improve. The leveling of the engineer and the blacksmith is terrible. There just isnt enough work for them to level up (unless you start spamming training dummies and minecarts). Please just add a option ""train while idle"" and not just until level 3. I dont mind if that would take very long. Another thing that needs to be improved is that you can set in options or you guys must go running when they spot a enemy or charge. A lot of times when a bunch of skeletons comes in my farmers go charge them what results in getting them killed. Furthermore needs the tutorial way way way better. If you absolutly new to this game it takes  a lot of time until you fully unterstand all the contrtols. The last point I think needs improvement is the spawning mechanic. I think it should be like you strt with 20 points and those you can divide over different spawn things. You want copper to be frequent? 1 point. You want copper to be common? 2 point. You want to start with weatseeds? 1 point. You want medium trees? 0 points. The system how it is now results in being endless busy to find the best spot which is really frustrating. And for the developer I recommend to take a part time job so you do still have time for timber and stone. Cuz even tho I pointed a few negative things out doesnt mean it isnt a great game. I strongly recommend this game and other then this few points, I couldnt find anything bad about this game."
