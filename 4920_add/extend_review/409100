It's challenging, cute, charming, and has a good heart.But what I really want to talk about is the developers.  You see, I suffer from hand tremors, that I must take medication for, and there was one part of the game that I just couldn't complete, because a finger would shake and mishit a key.  I emailed the developer about it, and not only were they very kind, quick, and understanding in their reply, they completed that section of the game for me so I could continue.  There's very few developers who would do that for a person, and I really appreciate it.If you like platformers, and you like cats, I highly recommend this game."

I’m not used to play platform games so much, but I enjoyed this little game. I don’t know if it’s because I’m not used with this style but the controls felt weird sometimes. Especially when you need to perform certain jumps. The story is simple, the art is cute and I enjoyed the BGM. The final song was very cute too!7/10. Get it on a sale (I think that the full price is a bit expensive for such a short game) and enjoy the kittens."

,Recommended,409100,32586442,Posted: 20 June,all,niX,"Do you love cats? If yes, then you will get enjoyment from the love and care that has gone in making this a cute game with tons of cats and references to cats. So cat lovers rejoice!ProsFeatures simple yet aesthetically pleasing visuals. Nothing fancy, but the game is nice and colorful.A unique soundtrack to accompany the game. All of the music in this game is wonderful and makes everything feels more relaxing (to me).5 stages in total, all with a different look, objective, and unique end stage boss/objective.They are very generous on the number of lives you have (7) and have decent checkpoints. Even if you run out of lives, you will be able to start from your last check point and don't have to restart the game. This makes the game more enjoyable and stress free. They didn't go out of the way to punish you for a section that you may be stuck on or want more practice at.The dev team on this game is fantastic. They are dedicated to their game and to making the game more playable and enjoyable for other people. They constantly monitor the discussions section and offer help to anybody that asks. Their dedication stretches so far that they will help you find something or get past a part that you are stuck at if you send them your save file. They recognize the parts of the game that are unpopular and have taken criticism in stride. I'm glad that I bought this game if not to support a group who are so dedicated and helpful.Part of the proceeds of the sales from this game went to charity (and continue to do so). They've donated to a number of charties that help our fellow feline friends. By buying this game, you've done something good and didn't even realize it!A decent length of about 4-5 hours, features cards and relatively easy achievements.ConsCombat can be difficult. This game wasn't really designed around combat, and the first two stages have a ""boss"" that you have to fight before you can advance. This game was a platformer that was designed more around timed jumping, stealth and avoiding obstacles. Thankfully, you're only forced to ""fight"" during these two instances, but still frustrating nonetheless.The controls are a bit slippery and can take some getting used to. I found this game nearly impossible with the keyboard and had to play with the controller. I also found the long jump to be useless and the double jump to be much more preferable. Some areas take a lot of practice to master before you can actually make progress.The piano finale in Chapter 4 is probably the worst thing about this game, and anybody who has played this will probably tell you the same. I understand that they wanted to offer variety in their end stage sections, but putting a Guitar Hero rhythm thing in a game like this was not a good choice. There's little room for error, and it requires good reflexes and a lot of patience. For an added kick in the♥♥♥♥♥ there's also an achievement to do it perfectly with no mistakes.. which I imagine made a few people want to tear their hair out. But I think that the devs have learned and will not repeat this mistake if they make another game (we hope).If you're not one for collecting, the fishbones may be a frustrating aspect. I only had one stage that I found it difficult to collect all the fishbones on the first try. For the most part, they are laid out in a way that make them relatively difficult to miss. But if you miss 1 or 2 fishbones, it can be hard to find what you missed, and you have to keep replaying the stage over and over again."

The jumping is painful, and since this IS a platformer, that's pretty much all you do. The movement in this game is extremely slippery and the controls are just a mess, so it'll often take 10-15 tries just to do the simplest of jumps. Yeah, the cats are cute and I had high hopes that this would be a relaxing and enjoyable game, but unfortunately at this point it's just a chore to play, and I don't think there's enough enjoyable gameplay to justify buying it at full price."
,Recommended,409100,22223650,"Posted: 3 April, 2016",all,Erbkaiser,"The Purring Quest is a cute platformer where you play as a cat. The game takes place on a twodimensional plane where you (the cat) has to jump, climb, claw weaker enemies, and avoid bigger enemies like dogs.Along the way there are collectibles: each level has 200 rotten fish to find, one trapped cat, and one other item.The strengths of the game are in how it feels like you really are playing a cat, with a world that looks to scale and plausible dangers. It is an 'epic quest' but on cat scale.There is no voiced dialog, but at several times the story is told through textboxes. Which is a bit of a shame as the game intro is completely textless but succeeds perfectly in telling the game's story, and is excellently animated for this game style.Good points are how good the main character is controllable -- as long as you use a controller. The game offers two different jump styles: long jump and double-jump. You can switch as you start the game to a style that you like best.I also tried keyboard controls, but they don't feel as responsive as the  controller does.The levels are all relatively easy to get through with a boss fight or other challenge at the end, but they're all very possible. The challenge comes from finding all hidden items.In level three you get a hiding ability that made me laugh... Solid Cat.Bad points are that the game occasionally likes to hide enemies behind foreground effects. This leads to a cheap death. You do get seven lives and even if you die seven times you can respawn at a checkpoint, but cheap deaths are never fun. You also have falling damage... for a cat. Thematically that just feels wrong.The game starts in a pretty dark level at a graveyard which may be too scary for younger players - not that anything bad happens, but the mood can be scary. Afterwards everything is lighter and more fun so if playing with a young child consider starting them at level two.Overall fun game and definitely worth checking out if you like platformers."

76561198030690472,Recommended,409100,19039762,"Posted: 12 November, 2015",all,maestro,"I gave it a thumbs-up because I am really hesitant to thumbs-down a game that can easily be fixed with a few tweaks.Pros: The game is done in a really nice aesthetic; I feel the graphics and sound are very nicely done. The theme is cool, and from what I've heard thusfar of the soundtrack, it is rather nicely done. Some cool mechanics (like hiding) etc are nice.Cons: Game might be a little simplistic for some, but then it is a 2D sidescroller.What needs fixed:1). XPadder for some weird reason does not like this game. This is the only program that can tell XPadder is running. I have never seen any program or game be able to tell the difference between keyboard input and XPadder. I bound the Q button and the spacebar (attack and jump respectively) to different buttons on my joypad using XPadder (because the game ONLY allows 360 controllers). When I pressed the button for jump I'd sometimes jump, but sometimes attack. This obviously wasn't going to work, so I was forced into using WASD controls instead. (Side-scrolling on a 360 analog stick is a huge ""NOPE!""). Not sure what to suggest here, other than perhaps looking into enabling more controllers than just 360 controllers.2). The first stage's boss's hitbox is really wonky. In fact, the character's attack hitbox seems a bit off. The first boss is very erratic, it seems to be entirely random if you hit the boss, or the boss hits you, or you trade hits. Given that he takes more than 6 hits to kill and you can only take 6 hits yourself... yeah, good luck with that. I think the best thing to do here, is to give the player character a slightly bigger hitbox with his attack. Also, it'd be nice if we could attack in mid-air, the first boss seems a bit frustrating when you spend most of the fight waiting for him to attack you (and you'll probably just get hit in mid-swing anyways, no matter when you time it). Also for some weird reason, the boss's hitbox seems to be ""off"" too -- when he flies side-to-side, he was ""hitting"" me even though he wasn't actually touching me.3). Sound/Music FX sliders would have been nice in the first config dialogue popup before you actually get into the game. I have a strong pair of headphones, and most programs I need to turn the volume down considerably or I get my eardrums blown out. Being able to set volume levels before actually entering the game is a godsend, so it'd be really nice if you could include that."

I am so in love with this game! ♥The Purring Quest is a reallycute but also emotional platformergame.Story:You have to play Kimchi the cat and already the opening story is heartbreaking.10/10Music:Really beautiful and even after a while not annoying.10/10Design:For a 2D game it looks really cute. The landscapes are well detailed drawn. I also like the animations of Kimchi if you let him push something, jump or climb.10/10Gameplay:For me it is perfect. It is not too easy but also not impossible. Sometimes you need more tries but that just makes the game more interesting. You need to collect stuff which is sometimes harder to reach and you always have different boss fights at the end of a level. It’s not always just scratching the enemy… sometimes you have to make good movements and to hit for example a pinecone on the ground to shoot with it. Also you have to find in every level a caged cat to free them.10/10Frustration? At some parts maybe but the level of frustration is not that high since you always have 7 lives like a cat (well if 7 or 9 lives depends on country, religion/faith). Even if you lose all your lives you will respawn at the last checkpoint. There are lots of checkpoints (the cat trees) so you don’t have to do the whole level again if you fail.Achievements:They are all possible to make. Most of them you get really fast.10/10Steam trading cards:Yes!Bonus:No bugs, no crashes, short install time.10/10Price: I don’t know if it was in a sale or will be. I paid the original price of 9,99 € and I don’t regret it.I highly recommend this game!"

As I play through the first couple of stages I notice, yes the controls are pretty bad. Lots of input lag, but I tried very hard to like the game and I'm glad I did.I found that playing in windowed mode made the movement a little more forgiving. It is totally worth playing until the end, even if it gets frustrating.  Not to mention a part of their profits go to charitable organizations for cats in need.

,Not Recommended,409100,24604853,"Posted: 29 July, 2016",all,MrNinjaSquirrel,"The Purring Quest is a much cuter game than it is an enjoyable one to play. It seems worth getting that much out in the open right from the onset, as whether or not developer Valhalla Cat’s feline focused platformer is worth any sort of consideration, depends on how much its premise can carry it for you. If you exist at the center of a Venn diagram consisting of cat related paraphernalia, armchair philosophy, and graffiti calling for substance legalization, The Purring Quest is able to provide at least some amusement for a very distinct audience. For those less immediately taken in by celebrity cat cameos and catnip jokes, The Purring Quest quickly becomes more chore than delight.For every adorable cat on screen, The Purring Quest’s presents a dozen screens painfully plain and flat. This is as much a frustration due to how it contributes to The Purring Quest’s uneven appearance, but even more so as it is often impossible to read a level for platforms and hazards, resulting in many cases where the player must leap blindly and rely on trial and error to navigate to the end. As a strict platformer with zero objectives to contend with beyond running, jumping, and picking up fishbones, it’s hard to excuse The Purring Quest for screwing up such an integral portion of its design. Poor jumping controls and clipping issues further exaggerate The Purring Quest’s mediocre mechanics, to a degree that is the digital equivalent of kicking someone while they’re down.This feeling of sadness more than disappointment comes across primarily on account of how clear it is that Valhalla Cat’s legitimately love their game, and despite all its faults put their all into making it at least a little charming. I can’t fully recommend The Purring Quest in any capacity, in fact I feel insincere even saying it may be worth an hour of your time, but I do wish the best for Valhalla Cat’s future projects. They have a long way to go, but I’m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt that they’ll get there someday. Until then I will have to advise you to get your cat fix elsewhere.You can read more of my writing onKritiqal."

The premis of the game revolves around a kitty, Kimchi, who is in search of her human who has gone astray. During her adventure Kimchi runs into all sorts of obstacles and baddies while searching for lost kitties, collecting fishbones as well as other goodies. While the game is short -- about two hours to complete for myself -- it's definitely something I would replay just for the story itself. The only annoyance I had experienced with The Purring Quest was the atrocious control that made me feel like Kimchi was on roller skates, but I stuck it out and I'm glad I did. While playing this game I couldn't help but think about all the kitties I've had as a part of my life, how they've touched my heart and all the ones that are still out there who need homes that I wish I had room for. I'm grateful that the developer donates a portion of the game's proceeds to charity to help these innocent souls. <3"
,Recommended,409100,25720279,"Posted: 26 September, 2016",all,Penndragoon,"The Purring Quest is a 2-4 hour experience in which you jump your way through a handful of levels. Your main objective is to reach the end of a level. There is also a collection mechanic by which you are rewarded for exploring and collecting 200 fish bones, a secret item, and recuing a kitteh that has been caged up!The narrative is pretty straightforward. You are a cat looking for your owner who has walked off. (how rude!)Gameplay-wise, I felt the platforming was decent enough. I do want to note that there is a split millisecond delay between pressing jump and your cat jumping. It wasn't annoying enough to be distracting, as you get used to it relatively quick as you jump your way through each level. You definitely have a weight that keeps you from making super ridiculous leaps. That being said, at the beginning of the game you can choose to have on or the other; a couble jump, or a super high jump. Depending on how you like to platform, either seems to be adequate enough to locate all the items in each level. I personally preferred double jump so that I could fine tune some more difficult jumps as I needed.The music is also worth listening to. Very chill and soothing piano music!Definitely worth a play if you enjoy platformers and cats! There aren't enough games on Steam where you play a cat, so this was a nice play through."

The novelty is that you play a cat, and you get to see some other cats and do cat things.  I didn't mind paying full price, I like the game.

,Recommended,409100,23124777,"Posted: 21 May, 2016",all,Arabin,"First things first, The Purring Quest is a very short game. It took me 2 hours, of casual play, to complete the game and all achievements. The last 30 minutes were probably spent on replays looking for a single fishbone I had missed. If you only play longer games, you can stop reading, as you'll be frustrated with the lack of content.That said, the game is cute, and imaginative, putting you into the role as a cat, The game at it's core is a platformer, with a total of 5 levels. At the end of each level you get a ""boss"" fight, where the gameplay shifts drastically. It causes a little confusion while you figure out what you need to do, but the game is forgiving in that you get plenty of lives, and should you run out, you can choose to ""continue"" and you refill all your lives.I still don't have a good sense of the target audience. The puzzles themselves are single and straightforward, so a child could play confortably, but there are also time bassed sessions and quirky controls that are better suited to an adult.The game offers keyboard or full controller support, but I found I had to keep switching back and forth. For general play, the controller was a lot easier, but when I reached a music ""boss"" fight, where you notes scroll from the top of the screen and you hit the appropriate button at the right time, I found the controller was almost impossible to manage due to the way the screen presents the info. Switching to keys, I aced the fight in my first try.I do recommend the game, and had a lot of fun playing it, but if you pick it up, just be aware that you'll get a max of two hours and find yourself wanting a little more."
,Recommended,409100,28975322,Posted: 3 January,all,kejim,"An adorable little game.If you love cats and can tolerate an occasional platformer, this is certainly a purrrchase you won't regret.The game isfairly short, each of 5 stages would take you anywhere between 30 to 90 minutes the first time around, but it's a mastercrafted piece of cat love withbeautifulartstyle, music and acastof likable characters (most if not all of which have real-life prototypes).It is pawsible to use one of the two control schemes - you can eitherdouble-jump(works as you would expect) or hold ""down"" before hitting jump key to make ahigh jump. Now, even though the former might be slightly easier,I'd recommend going with the high jump. Not only it looks more realistic (in real life cats have always been pretty rubbish at double-jumping), but it actually is one of the things that made me feel like I'm controlling an actual cat, not just a generic platformer character that happens to look like a cat.Some people seem to dislike the way the game controls, but I haven't noticed any major faults with it; you might miss your jumps while getting used to the game, but once I did (talking minutes here), it rarely happened anymore. When I did miss a jump, it was clear to me that it was my fault. Now, are the controls perfectly tight? Maybe not, but this isn't a game that requires high-precision series of jumps like more hardcore platformers would, so in my opinion it doesn't matter.Jump over chihuahuas, hit bigger dogs in the butt when they least expect (if you think you can run fast enough), hide in a box, throw apples at stuff (some Alladin you are, Kimchi...)Anyway, lots of clawsome things to do.PS: I always hated pigeons, you know?.."

There were many ledges I'd miss, and the last level I can't count how many times I fell. xD I would have loved more levels where you're forced to go as fast as you can, while having to collect fishbones.That was using the double jump.

A little simple for my preferences but I enjoyed seeing all the little pictures and comments and things on the background, and of course, the cats are rendered adorably. The animation is also quite lovely - I enjoyed watching Kimchi slow their descent as they slid down the tiled rooves. I also found it pretty neat how all of the level endings had unique challenges.I do feel that the controls were a little stiff, feeling it odd that I couldn't swipe in the air. I was also a bit upset by the fall-too-far-and-die thing, as cats are well known for their good landings. I mean, I understand from the skyscraper level, but the others...I definitely delighted in various little things that could be done - knocking over the coffee cups, sending apples flying, smashing vases - and hope there will be more of that kind of thing throughout levels in future games! I also enjoyed the soundtrack - it felt very fitting in every level. I also like how the menu screen changed as you progressed.It was quite jarring how the creatures would disappear in a puff of smoke if killed. I also wish there was more to dogs than just being seen and running from their patrol. Another thing is the pushing of objects - quite tedious honestly, though I appreciate that a cat is not going to push a cement block very fast.I think Snicker has to be my favourite cat in the game, he is beautifully fluffy and looks so happy.One thing that put me off a bit was Tika's ending speech. This is almost all of what we see of Tika and their explanation for capturing other cats is ""because I like being evil"" basically. Which sucks the meaning out of being a villain. I feel it could have been more impactful if Tika had been out to have them declawed because Tika felt they were a threat to him, which would bring back the whole ""no declawing!"" thing and make it more prominent, as well as set purr-spective on the captured cats -despite being maybe disadvantaged one way, that they were still equal to other cats, and hence deserving of the same love, as I feel was a message the game was trying to push (and a great one at that)."

As another review said, playing this game is therapeutic (at least if you like cats and melancholy).This grabbed me from the opening scene. It seems odd to have a full-out platformer and story based on being a cat. Yet there it is, and competently at that. A few things are contrived (it is a game after all) but it really felt like a cat's journey to find/help his owner, coming across the caged cats and celebrity cats really added a lot of flavor to the whole journey feel. A great story (I'd say with the same emotional impact as the entirety of How I Met Your Mother), told effectively in the short span of 2 minutes and with only a few animations. Proof that you don't need million dollar, epic sweeping cutscenes to deliver a powerful emotional punch. Unrelated thought, but the scenes in this were way better than in Starcraft 2: Legacy of the Void, in my opinion. The 'secondary' storyline isn't really related to the main story, but it also helps add some subtle meaning to the journey.Music/Graphics: Beautiful. Everything is hand drawn, with a lot of extra details in the foreground/background like trilobites, funny graffiti, even the fish bone collectibles have flies buzzing around them. The title screen music (main theme) instantly makes me melancholic, and the other music suits each level perfectly. Ranging from calm for the quiet forests/cities, to a sort of 'suppressed urgency' for the last. Would be a good idea to have a separate soundtrack if it's not already in the files.Controls: The weakest part. Kimchi is responsive, but sometimes overly sensitive when jumping (seems to have an initial deadzone for moving left/right, then suddenly accelerates). Also, with default controls I couldn't do a high jump while running to the right, so I had to change the control settings (which weren't a great choice to begin with). Changing the controls isn't the easiest thing in the world, it seems like *every* single option for every peripheral type is thrown into one big list, and you need to find your particular peripheral, taking some guesses. Also, the 'tutorial' messages don't seem to update buttons to match your particular setup but I could be wrong.Gameplay: I bought this game somewhat as a 'joke', but it's a surprisingly capable platformer. There isn't a huge variety in the platforming puzzles and a few sections can be frustrating (largely due to controls), but overall it's very satisfying, helped in part bythe desire to collect every item. Finding everything will make you work a little bit, but generally isn't difficult and won't make you spend 50 hours which fits the theme (as interpreted by me) of this game being more of an experience. Each level tends to have its own flavor as far as specific platform arrangements or moves. Also, the end sequence (or boss battle) for each level is a unique experience (first boss seems weakest designwise). The levels aren't too long, any longer and they'd be a drag in my opinion. The overall game length is quite short, but it still felt right to me.It's clearly an indie game and there are a few rough edges, but this is a great complete package with everything tying in to each other making it greater than the sum of its parts. It's apparent that a lot of care and love went into this game, from the selection screen all the way to the credits. The premise seems a little bit silly at first, but a game hasn't struck me as much as this has in a while (enough to make me write my first game review)."

The controls feel sluggish and unreactive, the dreaded ""skating on ice"" syndrome at times. I have a cat and she can (figuratively) turn on a dime, so better agility or traction would've been appreciated for Kimchi.The game allows you to pick between two control schemes - an original ""high jump"" scheme and recently added ""double jump"". ""High jump"" while more realistic is atrocious to play with, a really bad experience. Luckily ""double jump"" saves the day.The game's saving grace is that it's about cats. Cats earn them thumbs up. The backgrounds are suprisingly atmospheric and the music is adequate. The celebrity cats that appear ingame are very cool, particularly Henri.

The controls are ok, but if you are using the keyboard having to press ""S"" and then ""Space"" to high jump can be a bit fiddly at times. You will need patience to enjoy this game and if you don't enjoy platformers you migh want to stay away.But as a cat platform game it is pretty good and I must say I am enjoying it so far.

Only cute, realistically animated cats on an adventure, travelling through towns and forests, climbing on roofs and branches.To support its more realistic approach to the subject, The Purring Quest has lively hand drawn graphics that look very fluid in motion and a music track that adds to the relaxing atmosphere. Levels have plenty of collectables and the learning curve is fair. Controls get a bit wonky at times, but luckily game doesn't demand insanely precise platforming and there is just enough checkpoints to keep you from becoming too frustrated over a difficult jump.OVERALL: Simple and short, cat fans will love itThe Purring Quest doesn't do anything terribly wrong, but it doesn't give you that ""whoa"" feeling either. It's a cute and enjoyable game with a touching story.

The jumping and attacking mechanics are terrible which makes the game frustrating. Some games are frustrating when the designers make an overly challenging section but this is frustrating in places just trying to make simple jumps because of the controls. The game also promised humour but aside from a few lame catnip jokes the rest of the humour must have passed me by completely. The game is short, just over 2 hours to complete it with all the achievements. Normally that would be a bad thing but to be honest I was glad for it to be over. On the more positive side the game does have some cute graphics and decent cut scenes to frame the gameplay. It features various famous cats which was fairly meaningless to me but it might be a positive for some people. I feel bad giving this game a thumbs down because it feels like it was made with a lot of love and passion unfortunately it is love for cats and not video games. This is a game only for people who’s love for cats will enable them overlook the shortcomings of the game but not for most people."

,Recommended,409100,24756374,"Posted: 7 August, 2016",all,Moosician,"StoryThe tale of the Purring Quest is one that has not been highlighted by the developers. They sell themselves short by saying it is a game about meeting cats famous on the internet when the real story is buried in dialogue with cats and optional conversations. Kimchi begins his journey for unknown reasons in a cemetery teeming with rats and patrolled by hounds to meet a cat who tells Kimchi looking for his owner is silly and his owner must be very emotional. Once Kimchi is done being lectured by this philosophical cat, he treks farther in search of his lost owner. According to the wise cat, Kimchi is different than other cats in the fact that he is looking for his owner and not the other way around. According to the cat, cats should be the masters of the humans. Nonetheless, Kimchi still looks for his owner. Not much more can be said about the story without spoiling everything, but just know there is a darker evil afoot.GameplayAs a platformer, a game should have a fluid a consistent moving system and should not feel off. This is something The Purring Quest fails to achieve. The game feels very weird to control, especially in the beginning. The first area in the game was one of the most frustrating times I have ever had with a game- it gave me bad flashbacks of Sonic ’06 from my long lost childhood that I had never wished to recover. Moving around in the first level brought me to killing myself at least 4 times and getting beaten to death by small rodents twice. I was extremely upset with how weird the controls were made for the game and thought they could do better. You have to hold S and then press Space bar in order to do a higher jump. What kind of control is that? I did not play the game on controller at all and cannot say it would be a horrible experience on there, too, so I would recommend trying it out if you do purchase the game.Other than the awkward movement and “combat” system, the game also has straightforward stealth mechanics. You can press a button on, say, a bush while the enemy is looking away and they will turn around and pass you, allowing you to continue the level. There is a small window for error and if you time it correctly, you can leap over the enemy and progress through the level. Maintaining stealth in this game quickly gets boring and you just end up wanting to sprint past every enemy encounter in order to make haste.One key factor that struck me as odd about the game is the lives system. You have 8 lives and if you run out of them all, you simply go back to the last checkpoint and regain them all. There doesn’t seem to be any consequence to losing all your lives in any form other than your own pride.Graphics/PerformanceThe pixelated graphics in The Purring Quest are pretty but in terms of the platforms themselves, are not easy on the eyes. Sometimes it can be difficult to tell platforms apart from other things in the surrounding area and may take a few moments of inspection or trial and error. For me, it was frustrating realizing I had not walked on to another platform but that there was indeed a gap in between two platforms and I plummeted straight to my death. Things like this happened multiple times and made me take breaks from the game out of anger.I can happily say that I did not encounter a single bug or crash throughout the entirety of the game and this is something that made my experience more pleasant. No progress was ever lost unfairly and the game runs like butter.MusicAt first the soundtrack was pretty mediocre but by the third area I was enjoying listening to the tunes presented to me. Nothing I would listen to outside of playing the game but still, The Purring Quest has a pretty chill soundtrack overall.OverallPros:•	Pretty Artwork•	Collectibles for Completionists to Pursue•	Interesting & weird story•	Humorous characters that can be found•	Optional conversations with cats bring out the story•	Not a single bug or crash•	Nice soundtrackCons:•	Awkward movement and combat•	Frustrating first level•	Basic, monotonous stealth mechanics•	No consequence for running out of livesThe Purring Quest is a fun adventure that I can only recommend for completionists who will willingly collect all 200 rotten fish in each level and look for the side objects and cats. If you don’t try to get everything your experience with the game will be very short and shallow, devoid of much story and lore. I recommend this game heavily if on sale and you have a few dollars floating around on your Steam account. The game does have soul and it is obvious the developers put time and wanted to make the game as good as they could. I personally support a sequel with smoother platforming attributes and more levels."

But I ended up disappointed, for a few reasons.The story intro seemed cute, but the platforming was atrocious. I played with the double jump setting with mouse and keyboard and had a heck of a time with 80% of my jumps. Occasionally you'll run into dogs that will bark if they catch you, sending you back to your last check point. Combine that with the frustrating platforming and you're looking at a lot of repitition and tediom. Also repeating so many things kind of makes the soundtrack lose its luster; there's just not enough variety imo.Also the first boss battle was very easy and felt very tedious as well. attack the boss, casually walk around its next attack, attack again. Repeat until success. To me this game is more of a cute platformer with tedious jumps and level design, and not relaxing at all."

The jerkiness and something about the way the background moves (or doesn't move?) made me dizzy and want to throw up. It felt terrible. I had to sit and take deep breaths for a long time to recover and decided I couldn't play the game ever again.I hope the devs do some research into how people who are prone to motion sickness respond to the way characters move, how backgrounds move, and how the two move together.

Of course, though it is a short game, it is definitely not without its challenges, as some of the jumps to get all the fish and some of the battles can be difficult if you don't know what you're doing.The music is fantastic; tying it with the story itself has even resonated with me so much that it brought me to tears and full-on crying.  It's not often that I come across a game that actually plays with my emotions like that.All in all, I say definitely give this game a try.  It's short, but the story I feel is definitely worth it."

They won't take long, but if you're looking for items to complete the acheivements it will slightly increase the time to complete them.Patch was added later for double-jump but I didn't use it the first play through before updates were done, or when they added acheivements and I played again. I used it minimally and it seems a bit awkward. It may be a release of stress for the frustrating controls for some, but the movement of the character has improved.Pros:- Great graphics- Beautiful music.- Begining of story is already a tear-jerker! Fans of internet cats will love the characters that they meet.Cons:- At first release, the controls are VERY frustrating. They were improved, but can still be frustrating. You'll have time to get used to them but once you hit the 3rd level, the difficulty and frustration will go up. Sometimes can be slippery.- Without spoilers, the end of level 4 doesn't really match with the rest of the game. If you're not good at timed button pressing, GOOD LUCK!- Ending is so short. :(Overall: I'd recommend for anyone looking for a quick, cute/dorky game, but expect to be frustrated a bit. If you're not into jumping side scrollers, you may not like it. Luckily the music is really well done and is a pleasant distractor.Also, cats."

Took me less than 2 hours to play through and get all the achievements. It's a cute platform game though. I definitely wouldn't buy it full price. I bought it when it was 70% off, so for $2 it was fun while it lasted."

,Recommended,409100,29594284,Posted: 30 January,all,Laika,"""The Purring Quest"" is a cute little game about a cat trying to find their lost guardian. You play as the cat and have to jump and run through five different levels which all have a special kind of task at the end. You have to collect fish bones, jump over holes, fight different kinds of enemies, rescue caged cats, avoid unfriendly dogs and overcome other obstacles.The graphics are simple but beautiful and each level has its own kind of peculiar charm. The cats you meet on your way have funny things to say and some of them are very relatable for me, especially Henri, because just like me he is mentally ill. I also liked to see blind cats in the game since one of my roommates is a blind cat.I also like the small details in the game, like writings on the wall, mysterious eyes in the bushes and other little things which were nice to discover.One thing I'd like to emphasise is the fact that there are several messages against declawing in the game. Declawing is something no cat should have to suffer and it's good to give people these messages in the game so they have the opportunity to educate themselves on the topic. I also liked the inclusion of several disabled cats. I'm the guardian of a disabled cat myself and it's cool to have that kind of representation.It took me about 4,5 hours to finish the game with all achievements. It was difficult at times but it was not that hard to collect all fish bones, rescue all cats and find all of the items. Nevertheless it was a nice challenge and I really enjoyed playing it.I bought the game for 2,49 € instead of 9,99 € when it was on sale. I'm not sure if I think the game itself is worth the full price but if you like cats and jump'n'run games you should definitely get this game when it's on sale. Since some of the money that is earned goes to animal welfare I think it's also worth paying the full price if you can afford it.My conclusion: I really liked this game and totally recommend it for everybody who likes cats. :)"

,Recommended,409100,33558988,Posted: 15 July,all,Dart Aleks,"I like platformer games - even so they are rage-inducing for me. First - this mini-game at the end of fourth level is terrible (AAAAGGHHHHH). Buttons on the controller are counter-intuitive. I kept missing them. Combination at the end was rage-quitting at best. I gave up and did on my keyboard - it was much easier.Well, as for other things - platforming in itself was decent. Some hitches here and there, but nothing terrible. I felt game is really short and there is no inclination to search for secrets and stuff. Story seemed unfinished and there were more potential to tell more.For me game is so-so. I can't really give it negative review, but there are other platformers who really shines and leave this game in a shadow."
,Recommended,409100,33660794,Posted: 19 July,all,homertino,"The Purring Quest is a highly enjoyable short and sweet platforming game where you are a cat in search of his care taker. Unique visuals with impressive original animation are used for the movement of the cat and can be quite humorous at times. If you are a cat lover who likes video games then this is a must play just for the feeling of what it would be like to wander around town as a cat. A relaxing audio score provides a calm setting and helps ease the tension while searching for all of the items throughout the game. The story attempts to be emotional but comes across as a bit strange and somewhat mysterious at times. Overall, this game is geared toward casual gamers, indie fans and anyone who loves cats. If you are looking for a long game with lots of replay value then you will not find it here. However, don't let that stop you from adding this great game to your library for a fun, short platformer."

Also, Achievements and Trading Cards!One other note I had to mention: this game has proper controller support. In fact, I managed to hot-swap and still get it to work. I can't get TF Devastation to work properly with a gamepad!Most of the bad points I have are mainly nitpicks, but here goes:It's short but sweet and not a hard game.Controls take getting used to be easily picked up.No manual, so don't know how to switch control schemes (from High to Double Jump)In the last level, it's hard to judge platforms from the background.Fish skeletons are hard to see sometimes. I got 199 out of 200 in the second level! (It was behind an iron fence/balcony btw)Why can't a cat that size take on a Chihuahua?"

The hand drawn art is beautiful and so is the soundtrack. The mini game in level 4 is super adorable. Point being, if you are a sucker for kawaii stuff you will like it. If you aren't, the gameplay isn't anything special and it will fall flat. Plug in a controller if you want to platform MLG style."
