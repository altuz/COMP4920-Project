,Recommended,409160,29881363,Posted: 12 February,all,Faudraline,"“I like work: it fascinates me. I can sit and look at it for hours.” ― Jerome K. JeromeComing from the designer behindThe Stanley Parableand a young developer team, this free little game with a needlessly long name carries a similar pattern of blatant absurdity. Due to the ridiculous amount of probable effort that I'd have to put while writing the whole completion of the title each time, I'll be referring to the game simply asDr.Langeskovfor the remainder of this review. Now that is settled, let me try doing this properly.Following the example ofThe Stanley Parable, it is somewhat hard to write a review to a game that would be better played without knowing anything about it. So, if you'd like to enjoy the full experience, I'd highly recommend to stop reading and give it a try to see it for yourself. Since it already is a freeware, you won't have anything to lose rather than 15 minutes of your time.Still here? Well then. You've asked for it. Since we've already downloaded the game, we must have intended to actually play it, right? There is one little problem though. As the game starts, we are very apologetically informed that they are unable to let us play since it is a single player game and there is already one person playing it. Apparently we have to wait for the other player to finish the game before trying it ourselves. But since the studio conditions are a bit below excellent - nope, of course there are no safety hazards! What is it you are thinking? - There is a shortage of employees in the whole place due to a recent strike. We are informed that it would all go quite swiftly if we were to help them simulate the game for the player inside. Reluctantly agreeing, we start following - or try to follow, at least - directions of the young director with a mousy voice and a British accent, who dreads that our every single action might end in a catastrophy.As you can see, this short, 15 minute adventure is a complete parody of a developmental concept. There is no actual game here. Like that the cake was a lie, the game itself is a lie. The whole thing is a smart and somewhat enjoyable conceptual experiment that could invoke some appreciation. Certainly not a masterpiece - and not in the claim of being so anyway - and the humor isn't exceptional, butDr. Lengeskovpresents you a distraction and a smirk on your face for 15 minutes: a task well done. It might be noteworthy to mention that the expected gameplay is somewhat linear contrary toThe Stanley Parable, carrying only one possible ending. The idea is to enjoy the environment, the concept and the reactions you are having around. Very much like any joke.Throughout your playthrough, you might want to investigate the environment, since there are items around to collect for achievements. Achievements themselves are a bit buggy though. I recommend not using the steam overlay or sending the game to tray since it may block achievements from unlocking. If all else fails, verify cache and they should trigger the next time you are meeting their conditions.Go ahead. I know that you are already curious. It is not the wittiest kid on the block, but it is here and it is free with certain creative value.

,Recommended,409160,29793686,Posted: 8 February,all,Miss Akira the Spookybutt,"This was the coolest heist game that wasn't Payday 2 I ever played. I had trouble at one point trying to do a non-lethal run in the game because the game glitched and the tiger kept eating the guards. The devs promptly patched it, of course, being as fast as they are. The knife animations are wicked cool, too, but the non-lethal takedowns have their share of badassery.The grappling hook was a great addition, and I enjoyed scaling walls and throwing rocks from the roof to distract guards. The effects are amazing. 10/10 best free heist game ever made."

,Recommended,409160,29939881,Posted: 15 February,all,TiffanyAK,"This is very much like a short and free version of The Stanley Parable - same type of humor, sarcastically narrated story, and joke gameplay. The gameplay itself is very short, taking about 15-20 minutes, but getting all the achievements and finding all the secrets will take a fair bit longer and at least a couple (or more) playthroughs. The gameplay is a fair bit more linear than The Stanley Parable, as there is only one potential ending here which you will eventually reach regardless of what you do, but there is still a fair bit to interact with in your environment and several ways to defy and aggravate the narrator for a time.I don't want to give too much detail here, as it really is so much better if you play it without knowing much, if anything, about what you're in for. That made it so much more fun and befuddling for me."

,Recommended,409160,30126752,Posted: 23 February,all,D3C,"A darkly hilarious comedy about a game you never get to play. Almost as much a walking simulator as a point-and-click adventure, Dr. Lageskov takes you (literally) on a backstage tour of game development, with top-notch voice acting and a surprising and engaging script with humour quite reminiscent of Portal 2. Would be worth paying for, but it's free! And short! And funny! Would search every nook and cranny again (and did... several times... stupid pretzels)."

I wasn't expecting this, but the vehicle mechanics are great. The atmosphere in the mansion is really tense, the characters are really built in depth for such a short game and the fighting mechanics are brilliant. The fight with the tiger especially is thrilling and the way some events are randomized with each playthrough makes the player feel more like part of a directed movie than a game at times. 10/10."
