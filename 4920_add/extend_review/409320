76561198048974498,Recommended,409320,26265784,"Posted: 28 October, 2016",all,rjmacready,"Okay, so this isn't quite Alien: Isolation 2, System Shock 3, or Dead Space: The First Person Reboot, but it's not too shabby for a stop-gap space-horror game in the meantime.First things you'll notice, regrettably, are a distinct lack of Options (no brightness or keyboard remapping?) and the fact that the beginning of the game is very, very dark visually (perhaps too much so, depending on one's settings). The atmosphere, however, can't be faulted, and the sound is a particular stand-out, keeping you constantly on-edge before any action even begins; which is quite a ways in, and that's always a good thing in my book (way too many horror games overlook that slow-building ""suspense"" thing which is so integral to their success).And while the early part of the game is exactly what you'll expect - wake up to a spacecraft full of corpses and spooky dormant robots, re-power parts of the ship, see and hear hints of whatever created the corpses in the first place, etc etc - it's all exceptionally well-done, so it's hard to complain. In all honesty, I eat this♥♥♥♥♥♥up for breakfast, so you won't hear any whining from me in that regard.None of which to say this game is anywhere near perfect, or even substantially polished...but the devs seem receptive enough to people, and willing to make improvements (as they should, for that price)! And while I found nothing truly game-breaking in my playthrough, I did manage to fall through the floor into oblivion once or twice, and the lack of a jump button forced me to go back to my previous save on at least one occasion, on account of a fallen chair (!) which I knocked over and couldn't get back past.But hey - the likes of Valve have yet to fix that bug in Left 4 Dead 2 where you fall through the hospital's elevator floor (yeah, you know the one), so I'm not going to angrily berate a fledgling indie company for the occasional glitch. Save points are also reeeeasonably frequent - at least up until the last handful of hours of gameplay - so these moments were minor inconveniences at most.There are, of course, a few other minor complaints I could make: the voice acting makes our protagonist sound like he's quite the chipper lad, who's having quite the boy's own adventure while being harassed by all manner of cyber-enhanced meanies; the hacker mini-games are a bit on the pedantic side, timing-wise (hacking in a survival horror game should be a minor challenge, not a major one); the enemy A.I. is a bit on the daft side, and seems to give up the chase way too quickly; only SOME dead bodies seem to be searchable, and SOME bottles able to be picked up and thrown to distract enemies; the user-interface maps are kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥and downright INCORRECT at times; the backtracking is a tad on the overdone side; and the stealth is, er...limited in its usefulness, and somewhat inconsistent and unreliable at best.Oh, and in answer to questions anyone is having in this department: this is definitely more of a super-moody, slow-paced ""shooter"" than a full-blown stealth-horror game, as I frankly found myself simply attacking the monsters far more than trying to sneak past them. In that sense, this is arguably closer to a classic survival horror a la early Silent Hill games (i.e. minimal ammo and weak melee weapons) than the more recent, super-stealthy likes of Outlast and Amnesia (though there are still bits where stealth is of the essence).Whether this approach is a good or bad thing is up to the individual: myself, I like both angles on the genre, though I've definitely been favouring the stealthier end of things in recent years (if only due to it being a slightly fresher take on an obviously tired genre of gaming). So think of this game as more of a flawed but evocative trip down Memory Lane than anything terribly ""new"" or ground-breaking, with just the rare moment of modernity thrown in for good measure.To be frank, this game appeared at a perfect time for Yours Truly, given the heart-breaking news that Outlast 2 WOULDN'T be released in time for this Halloween. I consider this a perfectly acceptable consolation for that delay, and if you're anything like me, chances are you will too. It's a super-solid, suitably immersive first-person horror game. Don't expect another SOMA, and you may well be pleased. But unless you simply can't wait - as I couldn't! - it might not hurt to wait for a decent sale. Even the mighty Outlast didn't cost twenty-five bucks upon release, for HAL's sake...Verdict: 8.5/10."
,Recommended,409320,25896069,"Posted: 6 October, 2016",all,Rood Boi,"This game is a fantastic start to a game. It does play a lot like alien isolation, but actually even outperforms it in several aspects. Even though this game has weapons, (which I think if fantastic, since so many horror games don't do this,) they will NOT make you feels safe at all, while in the Alien game I did feel like it took off some of the edge. This is partly due to such scarce ammo, equivalent to the early RE series, that when you miss with a bullet it almost feels like the game's over. And the atmosphere is simply captivating, which is why I gave this game a thumbs up.HOWEVER, it has way to many glitches and lack of configuration that really should be addressed. First off, you cannot change your controls, and the game doesn't do a good job of telling you what the controls are. And for as a pc gamer, this takes away a lot from my experience. Furthermore, several times my inventory would just stop working, and I would have to restart the game, or I would get stuck in the floor and be unable to move. And as far as glitches are concerned, I somehow managed to zone through the ship and drop of the map completely. Which forced me to restart, again. But the ship did look pretty cool from the outside :) Hopefully the developer fixes these issues. But without those issues the game is incredible, definitely worth buying. Feel free to check out my gameplay as well, if you want to take a closer look at how the game runs!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBEzaYnabaA&index=1&list=PLKMxTuqznyPMqAEG7ewxAKpIv_PdNFMii"

But that being said I play quite a lot of horror games and I may just be becoming imune, Dead Space doesnt even phase me.The graphics are good, the sound excellent, the story is a bit meh but not game breaking. One annoyance I found with the game is the constant to-ing and fro-ing from one floor and back to the same floor but con sidering the total disarry of the ship and the scattering of things needed in the game it is understandable and you would not expect things to be in the same room or deck in reality, but like I said annoying."
76561197970695975,Recommended,409320,27352179,"Posted: 24 November, 2016",all,Danny_G13,"The headline of this game made it sound very much like a more minimalist Alien Isolation, from a smaller development team, and it certainly captures a lot of the horror of that loneliness in space.You're Galen, who wakes up on a ship in deep space to find he's alone and the crew appear to be dead. Finding out what happened is the key to unravelling the mystery and escaping nightmare.Ok, in a change to my usual format I'll get the bad aspects out the way first:The lack of polish is pretty obvious - it's a three man development team and they're only human - Camel 101 did a hell of a job with this for such a small crew, but that doesn't alter the bugs, from falling through floors, to flaky AI, to buggy saves with resurrected dead enemies, there are some real rough edges here which a bigger team would have been able to smooth over. I am absolutely not blaming them for poor development, it's just such a big game with so much content is hard as a smaller team. The combat is poor, for example, as is the slow weapon switching (switching to the pistol takes 5 seconds including the forced 'safety off' animation), and the inventory system is rough as sandpaper. You also cannot view the keyboard controls, far less change them.However a major criticism is that in order to extent the play time a lot of regurgitated gameplay is forced on the player by retreading old areas all over again. There are a few areas which Galen has to go and do something, then something else, then something else, in order to be able to achieve the first. It's a bit too grindy in that way at times - ironically enough Alien Isolation is guilty of the same thing. It's not a good idea, guys! 'Fetch' gameplay never really works.There are a few other negatives, but the above is a fair representation.The positives are strong; there is a really fun story here, with a few twists and turns to keep you guessing. The game is horror and manages a great sense of dread and helplessness, with a nice variety of enemies to avoid them feeling generic. The voice acting in the main is good but one of the characters is notably worse than the others, which is a bit of a shame. The save system is also good - each level has save stations which allow unlimited saving whenever you're near them - it's a good way to make the gamer feel 'safe' about the saves while not being completely manual. And the music/ambience is really terrific - one deck has music which is pure Doom 3, and sounds really ominous.Visually it is ok but no more - it captures the look of A:I but at a much lower budget, but for an indie game it looks not bad at all. That said even indie games are starting to look AAA - think Through the Woods and Ethan Carters.In summary:At around 20 hours gameplay you will get your money's worth from Syndrome - the plot is pretty good, the game feels solid and it's compelling entertainment, even if the gameplay feels very recycled at times and there are quite a few rough edges.I'd recommend this game.A word also for the support team particular the Exec Producer Bruno Cesteiro who is basically the guy behind the game and who was impressive for customer service to say the least. He went beyond the call of duty to assist and if all dev teams had such hands-on approach gaming would be in a better place."

,Not Recommended,409320,33363736,Posted: 7 July,all,pyrolocutus,"Syndrome has the setting to be a good horror game. The environment is suitably creepy, although a little darker than is good for creepiness in some place. The storyline is ok for a horror game. The enemy designs all work well except for one that looks like it's in a red latex bodysuit in direct light.What kills the game is all the constant backtracking. You'll run into an obstacle on one level, and have to go to another level, and possibly even a second level, before returning to the original level. In conjunction with long load times - I'm on an SSD and I'm playing on my phone during these load times - it stretches out the game much, much more than it should be. The save system, familiar if one has ever played Resident Evil games, compounds the issue - if you die on the way to a save point on a new level, you get double whammy'd by first reloading your previous save, then changing levels again - which with the long load times makes it a pita.The padding of objectives sometimes even extends to within-one-level. During the home stretch of the game, I had to insert a data core somewhere to unlock it. Get to the room, it's locked, I have to go to the tech chief's office on the opposite corner of the level to unlock it. I go there, unlock, return, slot in the data core. Now it apparently needs an additional decrypting or something at another station? Go to that station on the same level, find out the computer is locked up and I need to go BACK to the tech chief's office to do a hard reset. I do that, go back to the second decryption station, and finally get to exit the level while dodging monsters. In any other game, I would have done the first unlock step for the data core and carried on my way.The monster designs, as I said, were good. How they were used was poorly executed. It felt like almost all the monsters were script-dependent, so you had a monster closet effect going on throughout the game, which means sometimes you stumble over the tripwire, get killed, then go through the reloading process and approach it again more gingerly.Overall, the game would have benefited vastly from consolidation. If it's not going to follow a Dead Space-esque progression where you're going through the ship but a deck at a time, remove all the busywork objectives. Between all the load times and running around, my gametime was vastly inflated, at some point I decided to just plug through just to see what the hell else design decisions they made. Also, reducing the number of monster tripwires in favor of static spawns/patrols would have made it more interesting in approaching monsters, strategic eliminations or dodges.The enviroment, atmosphere, and storyline lay the foundations for a good budget horror title. The onerous pace of going through the game make it not worth it."

The game begin after you wake up from cryostasis only to discover that the spaceship you're on is strewn with dead corpses, mutilated bodies, and body parts.  Confused and baffled, your character is tasked with having to further explore this dark and decadent spaceship in search of other survivors, weapons, and tools to aid you in surving and finding a way to escape the ship.  What I like about this game is that you can either choose to run and hide, or fight back.  The enemy designs look nicely decent, somewhat like the Borg on PCP.  The overall sound effects are great which also contributes to the tense horror atmosphere.  What I don't like about this game so far are the bugs.

It really gives the ship a small feel and distracted my immersion, I started getting bored, feeling like it was redundant.  There aren't many options for graphics, but they did so well with the lighting that you don't notice too much, and the game runs well, very well.  It runs better than a lot of triple aaa games..

Most aren't relevant to finishing the game, but they add up to the creepy setting.Worth a couple of playthroughs for sure."

,Not Recommended,409320,32936823,Posted: 28 June,all,Lucky Shadow,"Basically, if you liked System Shock 2, you'll probably find some enjoyment in this. It's very reminiscent of that game, from mechanics to atmosphere to actual plot. Enough is different that I can say it's not a copy, but I can tell it was very heavily inspired by it. Not to say it's terrible. System Shock 2 was a good game, and Syndrome learns a lot from it and does its best to update it with new technology. The one thing they took that they shouldn't have is the console save system.Be warned going in: Auto save is not a thing that this game has, and it is going to be frustrating. Unlike the Dead Space games, which put consoles along a linear path so you get enough saves for it to not♥♥♥♥♥♥away an hour of play when you die, you have to seek them out after completing every single objective, and it very quickly becomes a chore.Monster design is also kind of uninspired, and the actors sometimes try a little to hard to make characters sound trustworthy/suspicious/confused, so most of the twists and turns of the plot likely won't surprise you much. Still, the sound design is top notch. You have to listen very carefully to differentiate the noises made by enemies and the creaks and groans of the ailing ship, and it instills just the right sense of dread to hear one of the big enemies thumping around down a corridor you have to get through. Good stuff.EDIT: I've played through another couple of hours, and I really just can no longer recommend it. For a long while I found the story intriguing enough that I kept pushing through, but that's no longer the case. The story didn't lose its intrigue or interest, it just spread itself out so much that it was no longer worth it. Combat went from difficult and sticky to an exercise in keyboard-eating frustration over the course of around two hours, and I got the feeling it would only get worse. Things that were already tedious got dragged out into half-hour long chores, and it got to the point where not only was the game not fun, I just couldn't maintain interest in anything else it might have to offer. It was a good first attempt at a game, but extremely unpolished and in need of WAY more play testing, preferably by people not involved in development at all."

At least not at its full price.Pros:- Atmosphere and Visuals- The game has combat compared to many other modern horror games- Storyline is good- A lot of references that blend in nicelyCons:- Half of the game consists of infuriating backtracking- Stealth doesn't work / AI is stupid- The game doesn't follow it's own rulesMore in the video below if you're interested :)http:// www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg_imBHtR_c

Waste your money on this game, it's not worth the £18.99 they're asking for it... hell it's not even worth £10! The graphics and sound design can't really be faulted but then you have everything else... allow me to elaborate:The gameplay is pretty poor, even for an indie game! Within the first 5 minutes of waking up from cryosleep I fell through the floor and had to reload the game... this happened on no less than 20 occasions throughout the game! What the hell!The enemies are just stupid, you can outwalk most of them making them instantly nonscary! But if you try to fight them with your wrench, well you're going to die... a lot, and by the way, you have to use your wrench, as ammo for the several (reasonably) powerful guns is so few and far between you'll almost never use them!So why not just stealth around the enemies I hear you ask, well I'm glad you asked that as it brings me to the stealth gameplay or lack thereof! Stealth in this game is all but impossible, as the enemies patrol routes make no sense and are in such confined areas that they will spot you no matter what you do! Add to this that the crouch function has no toggle and the fact that crouching is irritatingly slow!Sprinting, although unnecessary in most cases, is just annoying for two reasons: 1) The sprint duration is like that of an 80-year-old man who's smoked 20 a day for the better part of 60 years! 2) The placement of the sprint key makes it impossible to use the mouse to change direction! In fact, the layout of all the keys is absurd, there's no key map to tell you what anything does and you can't even change the hotkeys from the options menu! What FPS game in this day and age doesn't let you change the key configuration!The story, what little there is, is uninspired, dull and boils down to a giant fetch quest! It's like the developers didn't even try or got bored themselves half way through!All in all, this game should not have been released in its current state. It's buggy, dull and has the worst game mechanics and controls I've ever seen! I couldn't even bring myself to finish it, as every time I'd play it I'd just end up getting angry!So, in conclusion... Just play something else!"

You have to wait like 1 minute between spawns while the game loads, then you try to hit an enemy and have to wait for its vulnerability after an animation, and then if you swing at it, it's basically a gamble if it will connect the hit or if its arms will grab you, and repeat over and over again. I can't get past the first level and it's ruined my experience. Such a pity because it's quite atmospheric. The graphics aren't great but it doesn't matter. The combat ruins the game, not the graphics."

Basically setting everything to low and still jittery/stuttering.  I even lowered the resolution.  I don't have problems with other games.  My specs are not a super gaming rig but they're not bad.  I even contacted the developer, but they could not correct the issue.specs:AMD Phenom II X6  3.20 GHZ32 GB Ram64-BitAMD Radeon R9 390 8 MBWindows 7So have made it to ACT 3 now and it's still as disappointing and frustrating as when I started, lots of backtracking and poor combat mechanics.  It is also insanely difficult just trying to ovoid the monsters because you never get any ammunition for your weapons.  I have died more times than I can count with makes the game play very boring when you have to keep redoing very difficult missions 3-4 times just to make some progress.  Save points are very few and far between.   To the people who said this was scary, really?? you got to be kidding!  I really regret buying this game but feeal I have to finish it just to get satifaction."
