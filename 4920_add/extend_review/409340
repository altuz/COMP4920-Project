I am requesting a refund.Please don't release your games until they have SOMETHING, ANYTHING that makes them worth someone's time.This is unacceptable. If you made this game in ""Your spare time as a hobby"", that means you should show it to your friends and keep it off of Steam. Grrrrr.https://youtu.be/OU4asWJbLJ0"

,Not Recommended,409340,21108924,"Posted: 10 February, 2016",all,Sir Jaredson The Swagon Dragon,"I purchased this game for the simple fact that I could buy it through selling my trading cards. To start, there is no form of single player, and you need to play multiplayer, but there is not  aplayer base to do this, so you have to play with your friends. The Gameplay is clunky, when you let go of the movment key you continue to move for a bit. There is not actual player models. The game is fun if you are screwing around with friends, but sucks in other aspects. I think that this game could be awesome, the concept is cool, but there just isnt enough developer interaction. I woudl liek to reccomend this game, but until it has some MAJOR chane, i will not. It is a real shame, this coudl be a great game."
,Not Recommended,409340,32155994,Posted: 3 June,all,Blanchflower,"This game severely lacks content. Although all the achievements are easy to get, stay away from this game unless you are a hardcore achievement hunter for perfection. By the way, I doubt that the developer will add any new content soon.The tower defense part of the game in Single player mode lacks ideas and it is repetitive and boring. The Multiplayer part of this game is one bad joke."

,Not Recommended,409340,30641365,Posted: 20 March,all,"Axel ""Not the Real"" Foley","This game has no clue what it wants to be. Multiplayer mode is a (really crappy) FPS, but singleplayer is a tower defense. It is nonsense, but with the confusion out of the way, both game modes are full of severe bugs. The tower defense mode doesn't progress, you play until the enemies stop spawning, and they don't get any tougher. Multiplayer is strange because any combination of usernames/passwords work.I understand early access, but my review is one of the first in about a year, and this game is still really bad. According to a post the developer made, they are not even focusing on this game as much as they have another project in the works. Because of how poorly made this game already is at launch, and how many issues are currently plaguing it, there's definitely no chance of it coming back from this if they're busy with another project. This game is as good as abandoned.For achievement hunters/completionists, achievements are quick and simple. Just another crappy game on the completionist trail."

It's so bare bones yet fails on anything it could fail at. Maps are huge and look ugly from the fog effect yet have no purpose and are mostly flat ground, most of the weapons are carbon copies of each other with new models, and that whole thing about adding new maps and weapons monthly is a complete lie."
,Recommended,409340,22767529,"Posted: 2 May, 2016",all,TrexFPS,"Hi guy who makes this game. Please ignore all of the other reviews underneath because I think if you have the balls to make a game and go and participate in a competition then you deserve more than them.I have not played the game for long but I have got a few things I have noticed that can be fixed, dont worry though, you will get a lot of them:The characters who fight and stuff need a lot of work, the capes fly about and everything about them isnt right including the weapons which if you hold one the enemy will be holding it regardless of what they have equipped and vise versa.Some of the weapons could do with a better explanation of what they do and some should have buffs and de buffs.ADD BIGGER MAPS. Moon could be so much better with a bigger map and have some little hideaways on it just there to make games more interestingMake a note on the multiplayer option that you have to host your own server.Run a few tests too see if you can spot a few more.Make the characters more life like in their movements.You have a good principal of a game here but you just need something that will make it stand out. I know it sounsds like a lot of work but trust me, if you stick with it, it will be great!"

Dev Team work on another project, and it's nice, but too short team to released a finished game. Sad.My first evaluation about Perraw was :Perraw remember me old playing mode, as Quake.... jumping, firing, no perk, simple and efficient.Perk and others may be include in future version, and it will be nice too.Support for these independant studio !"
