Still, it's entertaining and has all the hallmarks of a restaurant time-management game with upgrades, new locations, and easy achievements. The writing is awkward and strange during dialogue between the main characters, but the setting is interesting and I can always appreciate the sky-ship aesthetic."
,Recommended,409380,18933529,"Posted: 7 November, 2015",all,Anjeliq,"Among the Heavens is similar to your typical time management/restaurant games. Seat the customers by colour for a bonus, don't let them wait to long or they'll leave your business, user powerups to help you through the levels, etc.The one component they've added is a match 3 between levels to help you gather powerups.Cute game, cute voice acting, and addicting to spend some time on. I think the price point is right on for this game ($3 when I bought it.)"
76561198064050389,Recommended,409380,19555319,"Posted: 7 December, 2015",all,Jxt09,"I have never had a job waiting tables at a restaurant before and after playing this game I really don't want to!  Your character has to run his little legs off pleasing the customers.  There are 5 different taverns with 10 levels each.  It starts out easy and gets difficult as time goes on.There are different customer types.  Some have red ties which means they can only be seated in the VIP seats.  Some are impatient and will give you less money if you don't serve them fast enough.  There's even an alien that gives you a bonus if a nerd is seated after him (or near him?  I can't remember exactly).  There's a girl who gives you a bonus also.  Then there's the boss who gives you a bonus for serving him fast.Some parties of customers are so large that you have to combine tables (it does that automatically if there are empty ones available).  Though usually they come in groups of 2-4.  Oh, and some levels also have carry-out where a person will appear at the bottom of the screen and want to be served quickly.I've never played this type of game before but I have heard of them.  So I don't know how much this game differs from others like it.The gameplay goes like this:Customers enter and you seat them.  They look over the menu.Usually right when that first group is ready to order a new group arrives!  So either take the order first or quickly seat the next group.You take the order by clicking on the table, then clicking on the stack of menus at the bar.Then wait a few seconds while the barman fills the drink order (I assume these are non-alcoholic since they looks like kids!)Orders appear on the bar with a number of the table it goes to.  Click on it and then click on the table.When the customers are done (some customers order twice) a huge pile of gold wil appear on the table and they will wave at you.  Click the table and then click the treasure chest next to the bar.A few seconds after you leave the table a circle will appear with a small green section and a cursor going round and round.  You have to click on it when the cursor hits the green area to get a tip.After a second or so those customers will disapper and you can seat new guests.Only you have to do all this for multiple tables at a time!  If you take too much time you might not get paid.  I had one customer fade out before I could click to get their money.  Ugh.  And I was playing on the ""Easy"" setting!  There is also a harder difficulty if you really want to blow your brains out.  Or maybe I'm just not that good at this type of game!The music is okay.  It's lively and nice to hear but it's the same for all 5 restaurants.  I would have been nice to have a different tune for each one.  The decor changes but not much else.After every few levels there is a simple match 3 game you can play.  It will give you power up potions for use such as: move faster, freeze time, and triple points.  If you don't get enough points you can't advance to the next level.Graphics are charming in a cartoon-type style.  Though I found it difficult to see which customers were VIP sometimes and wasted time trying to drag them to tables only to have them zip back to the line.All in all I'd say it's a good game, especially at the current price of only $2.99.Oh, and the achievements are easy to get all of them (as of right now).   They don't have the impossibly hard achievements like some games do.  So this would be a good game for achievement hunters.  It took me a little over 6 hours to finish on easy, and having to redo some levels a few times to advance."
,Recommended,409380,19396212,"Posted: 30 November, 2015",all,Ɗʊىƙƒαℓℓ ✬,"This game is a fun marriage of Diner Dash and a match 3 game. Most of the time you play as a waiter/restaurant manager serving clients, assigning them to appropriate seats and purchasing upgrades. During the time in which you're not doing that, you play a minigame of match 3 (various layouts) and try to earn enough points to get single-use powerups for your restaurant. All in all, the game is reasonably priced and worth purchasing. It has quite a few customer types, restaurant upgrades as well as restaurant locations. The game gets very challenging.. very fast.. :) Enjoy!Final thing to mention, I haven't experienced any crashes unlike the other reviewers."

After every stage, you start over and everything you upgraded the stage before restarts. No sense of progression and no satisfaction after completing a stage. The server moves horribly slow, making it near impossible to not lose a couple customers even after all the upgrades (I am a sort of perfectionist on these types of games and this makes me very irritated).Do not be fooled by the amount of hours I have, if I start a game, I have to finish it. I had absolutely no fun or satisfaction completing the game. Save your time and money and buy something else."

It's a great game; a bit like Diner Dash, a bit like Bejeweled. It uses strategy and reflexes. Because I don't want to purchase the game twice, I've only been able to play an hour on the demo, so I got through a few levels still liking the game. Would I recommend the game? Yes. Would I recommend getting it from Steam? Not right now."
,Recommended,409380,31799188,Posted: 16 May,all,Dune Tiger,"Haven't played Diner Dash? No problem. Neither have I. But I've played several games like it, long before Diner Dash took the mobile/tablet world by storm before Angry Birds took the mobile/tablet world by storm before Candy Crush took the mobile/tablet world by storm... where was I?Right, Among the Heavens, then, is a full-blown, no-pay-wall time management style game that is disturbingly addictive and compelling to people such as myself that are attracted to arbitrary star ratings that don't, among other things, solve world hunger.  That is to say, you and some other bloke run several potion(?) taverns in the sky.  Because the story exists, not only do you and your bartender friend seek riches from creepy mongoloid sky people, but you also have special friends that drop in to visit as well as a grumpy old boss who is needier than my girlfriend.Anyways, the general gist of it (especially if you have not played Diner Dash or games of a similar elk... yes, elk; I'd explain that, but I'd have to kill you) is thus:  You and a buddy whose names I don't care to remember are seeking your fortune by serving people potions or skyshakes, if you will, while solving the logistical problem of how to go about doing it.  Each tavern will have a variety of table layouts with such classics as the two-seater and the four-seater, but sometimes you might even get a six-seater (I know, right?), and space is limited.  However, the population is insatiable as you appear to be the only cloudgrog joint in town and they will be clogging up your foyer as your tables fill up and the idiots do stuff like take too long reading the menu or dropping their drinks on the floor.The result is a self-inflicted chaos because everyone quite literally pays you in piles of gold, yet you never hire any staff.  Instead, you, the player, are left to seat and serve everyone as your moustachioed pal mixes the Nimbusjuice.  It's a very simple workflow:1.  Customer comes in2.  You seat the customer, preferably at a seat that matches their color for a point bonus3.  That customer eventually waves you over to take their order by dropping a ridiculously-thick menu on the table4.  You rush to that table to pick up the ridiculously-thick menu and must deliver it to the extra-ridiculously-thick pile of ridiculously-thick menus on the bar.5.  Your bartender business partner makes their order and leaves it for you on the bar.6.  You pick up the order and deliver it to the table.7.  They drink whatever the hell is in those bottles and when they're done, they leave you a pile of gold8.  You grab that pile of gold and drop it into a big chest9.  The customer sits there stupidly as they wait for you to collect their tip (thankfully, this is you in the chair, clicking on a spinny circle, not the waiter you running back to the table).Simple, right?  It all works intuitively and audio cues help you keep on track so you at least know you're going to miss something should you be off pace enough to miss it.  Now, take that whole workflow and layer it on top of itself, staggered, several times and you start to get the picture of what this is going to be.  Your waiter avatar has only two hands, meaning each can carry only one menu or one pile of gold or one order, etc. but thankfully, you can queue up several actions ahead of time (which can be inefficient if you go too far ahead).At any rate, the game very nicely eases you into the chaos it wishes to present in the later levels by providing a steady pace of new things.  At first, you'll just get acquainted of how to get things done, but the challenge ramps up as you are introduced to different customers who have different demands; some are impatient, some will order more that once, some take longer to make decisions, etc.  Some will come as large parties and force you to put tables together, giving up precious seats until they leave.  Some are blue and some are red and if you sit them in certain seats, you'll get a bonus (this is key to getting 3 stars, by the way).  Some have hipster scarves and will only sit at roped-off VIP tables because reasons.  Some even have the nerve to show up by themselves and you're like, ""BUT I CAN SEAT MORE PEOPLE, JERK"".  Got all that covered?  Great.  Now they can bring their own music that you have to play for them.  Now there's people coming in through the back wanting their order to go.  Now your customers are spilling drinks, sometimes because your boss has decided to sit in the corner and shake the room if you don't give him any attention (again, because reasons).But don't you fret - you have help as you can play a really shoddy match 3 game (it's easy) to get power ups that allow you to run faster or pause time, but keep in mind that these things are precious and shouldn't be wasted.  The minigame only shows up between certain levels and the way the game saves your progress means that if you blow your powerups too early, you might find yourself stranded on a tough level without anything to help you get through it with that precious 3-star rating.  You see, you can't go back to a previous level to farm powerups (although you can replay them simply to get that 3rd star) as the game saves after every level and reverts your progress should you decide to revisit one later on.  For example, if you currently have 35 gold (to buy upgrades) and 2 power-ups, and then decide to revisit a previously-visited level, you'll actually revert back to the stats you had at THAT particular point in time, which may be 18 gold and 1 power-up.  You can still move on with your current stuff, mind you, but you will always roll back to where you were, and then forward to where you are.  In short, there's no way you can affect your current progress so if you find yourself without any power-ups, there's no way to go back and get some and no store to go buy some.  Kind of a bum deal there.  Protip: try your dangedest to 3-star every level without using power-ups and save them for the really tough ones.TL;DR - Among the Heavens is a terrific time-management game that can really challenge you, especially if you're the type that needs to get those 3-star ratings.  It doesn't bring a whole lot of new stuff to the table in the genre, but this is a solidly-built game at a fantastic price, especially if you can nab it in a sale.  If you've played Diner Dash, you know what you're getting into and if you haven't, this is a great place to start and it is in no way inferior to the game(s) that inspired it."

I liked the potion theme and wish they had more assets to keep things visually diverse and fresh. Repetitive and stale experience is a real risk here. Pretty competent for this genre so keeping around until I am done reviewing all titles in this subgenre.Does not fullscreen correctly. Character sprites are clones of each other and obeys trict tabletlike formula with 3 star ratings and whatnot. Still the clicking action of the diner dash type gameplay is well done and the engine is stable and not unpleasant. The match 3 aspect is just for bonus items and bonus levels which cuts the grind, but the match3 itself is fairly dragged out and tedious."

I love the cute animation, voice acting and graphic style, and overall it gave me a very pleasant experience. There are also different types of customers with different behaviors, and sometimes you need to prioritize who gets which table first. This game also made me realize how restauranteurs feel when I go alone to their restaurants and occupy a table meant for 4. Now I know they must be cursing me under their breath :DThough I recommend this game, I must warn you, there is one VERY SERIOUS BUG - If you replay old levels you have already completed, then once you complete that same level for the second time, your total amount of gold coins REDUCES! Yup, you read that right. I can understand if devs want to prevent people from farming coins, they don't have to award coins again to those who have already completed the same level earlier. But reducing the total amount of coins is crazy and makes no sense. Especially on missions where I want to play again because I got only 1 or 2 stars and I want to get 3 stars, I end up with lesser amount of total coins every time I replay them.If this is not going to be a problem for you, then go ahead and buy this game. But because of this bug, some achievements will be very difficult to unlock, because in some of the tougher levels, you will need to upgrade a couple of things in order to get 3 stars, and you cannot do that when you have no coins left.
