,Recommended,409390,22269882,"Posted: 6 April, 2016",all,Heaviside,"Good variation on the typical marble game, though shorter and easier than I might have hoped. It took me around 3 hours to get gold on all 20 levels. Do not expect an ultra hard precision marble platformer like in Marble Blast Ultra or similar games. The gameplay is almost relaxing and without the typical marble game frustration, though there are a few tricky parts.There are also some differences from other marble games:- Camera movement is scripted. This generally works well since you can almost always see where you're going without having to manuever it yourself.- Marble moves slower and with better control than some other games (much slower than Marble Blast, better control than Marble Madness). Even going downhill the ball can slow if you stop pushing it.- No jumping.- Marble breaks if you fall from too high, and sometimes when hitting a wall too fast.Basically, if you like roll-a-ball games or Marble Madness/Super Monkey Ball clones, but wish they were less frustrating, this game is for you.Haven't tried it with VR support yet so I can't comment on that, but may update this when my Rift arrives in a month or two.Finally, was initially unable to play the game due to it crashing Steam on startup, but developers were responsive in getting it fixed. Solution was to hold left alt on launch to bring up the configuration menu, after which I've been able to start it fine."

I thought ""Oh this will be cool"" and at first it is... but this game makes the first cardinal sin of VR: they take control of the view away from the player... It's like you're sitting in a chair, and someone grabs your head, drags you around the corner and forces you to look at something... oh but your body is still in the chair...and now you want to puke.If they could get away from the problem of taking control away from me when they want to change the view, OR at the very least, make it slow, gentle and not jarring at all, THEN this might be worth playing in VR.  As for non VR?  Well it's just a marble madness clone. You're better off playing the remakes of the old arcade game unless you think fancy graphics is going to make a difference in the gameplay.Pros:I ♥♥♥♥in' love Marble Madnessit looks pretty damn neat in VRhas potential to be awesomeCons:It's not marble madnessIt throws away all the ""it looks neat"" by making you feel naseous.So yeah... Maybe I'll try playing it without the VR.  OR maybe one day the developers will realize that taking control away from the player in VR is like forcing a dog to take medicine by sticking your hand down his throat.  Maybe you think it's for his own good, but it's gonna come right back up when he pukes."

Even if it was paid DLC I would get it - loved it."

So instnatly feels dissorienting. But it at least prepares you for how the rest of the game feels.I bought it on sale because i loved marble madness. had i paid full price i would have been annoyed. It is unplayable for me and pretty much everyone i have shown it to. the camera (your head) moves with the marble, if the marbel twists and winds around a rail, you follow it the whole way, swaying side to side.The dev has said they have attempted to make the movement system work for as many people as possible but the intro and the fact the camera is really locked to the marble says otherwise. hopefully one day they will make this game mor eof a roomscale experience with no forced movement or someone else will make that game, because right now i cannot recommend this unless you have no vestibular system."

,Recommended,409390,24317711,"Posted: 14 July, 2016",all,ChaosUnown,"Marble Mountain is an enjoyable game where a little marble goes on a big adventure. Very much like a spiritual successor to Marble Madness, Marble Mountain focuses on controlling a marble and having it zip through tricky but enjoyable obstacles. The main problem you may come across is that the camera cannot be controlled, but after a while you get used to the quirky auto-movements and are able to make difficult parts with relative ease and enjoyment. And that's really the only qualm I had (among other vastly smaller nitpicks), will you be able to get the marble to it's ultimate destination?With plenty of levels, appealing visuals, monumental design, and tons of customization for the marble Marble Mountain is a game worth picking up."

Roomscale is amazing and the games that utilize it have been awesome.  However I still yearn for some good sit down games in VR.  Let's face it, with all the current popular roomscale games out there you can only play them for so long in one go before you get physically tired.  Marble Mountain has helped fill that yearning for sit down VR goodness.  The game isn't that difficult, but it definitely delivered a fun, enjoyable, and memorable experience.  It brought me back to my NES days playing Marble Madness but on a whole new level.  Props to the devs for their hard work and also I loved the tribute song in the ending credits :).Bottom line in my opinion: It's a good solid game worth picking up.  It's only about 3 hours long, but still worth the $10."

Only issue is there is a fair bit of discomfort with this title, not sure if it's the speed of the computer controlled camera or another factor. Maybe a bit of camera smoothing would help, or less severe transitions?"
,Not Recommended,409390,22988994,"Posted: 14 May, 2016",all,xzosimusx,"Nice game overall, music and level design was pretty good but the camera needs serious work to prevent motion sickness in VR. Specifically when the camera angle is changing and you are moving your head looking around at the same time. Perhaps instant cuts would be better than sweeping angle changes?Would not recommend until they fix this."

,Not Recommended,409390,22326568,"Posted: 9 April, 2016",all,Olafelof,"Only reason i'm actually giving this game a negative review is due to the fact that you can't control the camera at all. Nothing annoys me more than when you can't actually control the camera in a game where the camera angle is everything to this game. Altogether the game is really fun, but the devs really need to add in Controlling for the camera to really help the game be better."

As the camera angles change so does how the movement buttons affect the marble. It is terribly balanced, the camera will change to an angle which will suddenly make everything much harder, the controls are also bad. The marble tends to slide all over and you do not possess nearly as much control of it as you would like, its also nearly impossible to go in a straight direction once the camera changes. I would not recmoned this game and actually regret buying it."

But the needlessly dynamic camera is a killer in VR. Should look great on my monitor in 2D, but not here. Even the menus are nausea inducing thanks to flashy camera movements."
,Recommended,409390,24690185,"Posted: 3 August, 2016",all,Tonybyte,"I love this game in VR. However, I can play it for about a level before the motion sickness I experience requires me to take a break. The developer mentioned that they did testing and many people are fine. But they are also listening to feedback and will be making some adjustments in the future. In this era of VR, I'm happy with that response and look forward to it. I have only just started this game and will continue to play it in VR once in a while. Therefore, I do recommend it even though I haven't even tried it besides VR. The graphics are nice, the gameplay and challenges are fun, and I like the 3D world / ambience. I feel it's well worth the price for the dev's work.As far as whether you will get sick, all I can tell you is my experiences with tolerance: I can play Lucky's tale for hours. I can play project cars for probably 30 minutes but usually close my eyes during rough crashes or spins. I can't play No Limits 2 rollercoaster sim at all. I can fly for hours, even banking a lot, in the Aerolfy sim. This, as I said, one fun level and I need to stop to be ok. I hope that helps."

Some mentioned, that it plays like Monkey Ball, but that's not quite true, as you control the Marble itself and not the ground/the level.The marble controls spot on (playing with an x360 pad) and the levels are well designed, although as of writing this review, I only finished around half a dozen levels.Graphics are simplistic, but nice, and suit the gameplay very well. I had to tone the graphics a bit down from the default settings (i5 6600k/gtx970), to remove some judder, but now it's completely fluid and looks still nice.I like it so far and can recommend it."

Boy was I wrong and in for a treat !It's the game I would like to create if I wasn't so lazy and I dreamt of this a decade ago already. If you liked the old Commodore Amiga Marble Classics like e.g. Marble Madness, Rock'n Roll and Spindizzy you owe it to yourself to buy this! Even the background music has this retro demoscene vibe to it, I would bet my loose Marbles that the developer has a 16bit Amiga background.Oh by the way, I'm playing this in VR with Oculus Rift and this really makes me feel dizzy after 20 minutes and I believe it would take me to Puke City after 1 hour of continous playing. This is from a guy who has the Rift since 2 years and had no problems playing No Limits Rollercoaster for Hours. So if you want to feel like a VR N00b again, the automatic camera in this is for you.Anyway, please do yourself a favor and pick this up!"
,Recommended,409390,23846256,"Posted: 26 June, 2016",all,Zapix,"This is perhaps one of those MUST OWN! games for VR, especially if you were also one of those kids that spent a lot of time playing Marble Madness. It's a perfect example of a game that isn't a first person experience, and every VR game doesn't need to be just that. Lucky's Tale (via Oculus store) is another example of what I'm talking about.There are a few moments in Marble Mountain where I feel one of those VR effects, but it's nothing I'm personally concerned about. I think I have a very high tolerance to VR though, so I can't say how other people might react.Overall, I'm completely satisfied with my purchase here! If you don't have a VR headset, it seems you can still play it (VR optional), which is good for you non VR headset owners."

,Recommended,409390,28336514,"Posted: 12 December, 2016",all,GiZmOtmk (GNU Terry Pratchett),"When you first boot up Marble Mountain, you probably won't be impressed. The graphics look very cheap, the music sounds like some sort of cheap royalty-free track, and the noises made by the ""skull"" enemies that soon appear are just awful. It doesn't help that later in the game, the larger levels are very poorly marked and you will spend a decent amount of time trying to figure out which direction you're meant to go, and there's one particular desert-themed level that is just complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.But you know what? I really like this game, for three main reasons:1. Maybe it's just me, but I can't find a good old-fashined marble run game on Steam. Maybe they went out of fashion, but I really like the balancing act of manuevering many imaginative obstacles and occasional light puzzles and maintaining control over my marble.2. The controls are sublime. It's really easy to control your marble without losing too much control, yet when you have to maneuver across a sloped surface, you can almost FEEL the marble trying to roll away. it's smooth, it's responsive, and I love it.3. Despite the poor layout, I'm genuinely impressed by the design of the levels. The developer has clearly put some thought into building the world that you navigate, and there is a great amount of variety to the obstacles and puzzles. The levels are never just plain single-coloured blocks with the occasional decoration but fully fleshed out scenes and structures, and it genuinely feels like your little marble is going on an adventure.In addition to the above, at the time of writing, I'm up to a level simply titled ""Tricksy"", and that is when♥♥♥♥♥♥gets real and the developer kicks his design ideas up a notch.VR support is also a bonus. Admittedly, I can't review this as I don't have VR equipment at home, but I imagine it's quite cool. Having support for both Steam and third-party VR is a great idea from the developer, too.TL;DR: Buy it when it's on sale.Pros:- clever level design- great controls- good old-fashioned fun- VR supportCons:- looks cheaply made- poor level layout- that one ♥♥♥♥ing desert level- annoying music & SFX"

Contrary to the claimed blurb, the camera did NOT automatically adjust to show me the best angle - it frequently left me playing completely blind.And why the actual F..., when 99% of the movement in the game is made along the four cardinal compass directions (NSE and W), are the controls mapped to the four diagonals? The challenge should come from the layout of the game, not from the fact that you have to simultaneously press two buttons to move in a straight line!A badly designed game created by someone who clearly thinks that crippling the player is the same thing as challenging him. Really disappointing."
