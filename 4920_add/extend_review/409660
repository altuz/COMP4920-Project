The world map design is more like Super Mario Bros 3. I enjoyed this game, and you will too but there are a couple things worth noting: I still think the first game is better. The original is by far more difficult and I think the music was better, too. It was also the first mainstream game featuring AVGN, and that played a big role in its enjoyability by feeling fresh.I still recommend this game, but I liken the comparison between AVGN and AVGN 2 to Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade. Most everybody chooses Raiders as the better film, but Last Crusade is still high up there and worth watching. AVGN 2 is a more expansive game and brings fans of the first more entertainment of the same kind, but it lacks just a bit of the calibre the first one had, surprisingly.Still, it's recommended and I would definitely pay for a third game if its more of the same we've received with these last 2 titles."

While the first game was fun but unfairly hard (Those Death blocks), this one hits ♥♥♥♥in' ridiculous difficulty with it being much more fair. So let's dig into Screw Attack's latest attempt to give the ♥♥♥♥IN' NERD the platformer game he rightfully deserves!GRAPHICS: The visuals are a lot more shiny here, with more blood this time with gore that you can kick around. Being under the Unity engine, the game is appealing to the eye overall. Some enemies from the first game have returned, but it's not too big a deal. The death blocks have even got a slight tweak to their design, and the backdrops to each world is something to marvel at.SOUND: The soundtrack sound a HELL of a lot nicer, Specifically ""Security Breach"", and ""Hang Dong '97"". Each music track fits with what level you're trekking through, but certain levels pretty much have just a variation of the first song. That's not a bad thing, mind you!GAMEPLAY: This is where I'm gonna tell you this: Don't you ♥♥♥♥in' DARE start your game at any difficulty that isn't BALLS TO THE WALLS. If you're a GOD DAMN MAN, YOU WILL PLAY IT.This game is definitely gotten tuned up better than AVGN 1. Not only are the controls a bit tighter, but you're able to wall jump, punch, and glide your way through the 22 ♥♥♥♥♥in' levels to save the world (So long as you actually went out of your way to find the Nerd Gear, of course.) The Nerd starts out with his trust NES Zapper and quickly gets his Wall-jump Loafers during the middle of the Tutorial. As the game progresses normally, you blow up the Nerd's house and are treated to the World Map.Each stage has its own visual gimmick, but let me tell you, this game is as unforgiving as the dad you keep kissing♥♥♥♥♥to, only to never see him smile and say ""I love you"". No, this game is that dad that'll slap the♥♥♥♥♥♥outta you, call you a wimpy ♥♥♥♥♥, tell ya to grow up, and stick a cigar on your tongue just for good measure. Death blocks are back again, but not as many as before. That doesn't mean♥♥♥♥♥♥with everything else!Pitfalls, enemies that take more than a few hits to kill, enemies that'll float past barriers to give them a shortcut to James' vital organs, and Bosses that are as big as my ♥♥♥♥ing ego. And lemme tell you, it's a large ego. Oh that's not all! You get insta-death lasers, spikes, sawblades, and a ♥♥♥♥ ton of other things. And if you're playing the ""BALLS TO THE WALLS"" difficulty, you're only given 2 HP that are shown in Roll N' Rock beer bottles. One more hit, and BAM! Chunky Salsa everywhere.This game's got plenty of that ol' tried and true Nerd humor, with swears and farts, and even a special guest that everyone who follows ChannelAwesome would recognize as AVGN's Rival. And lemme tell you, It was amazing seeing him there. Let's hope these two get together in more projects, as I happen to enjoy the both of them.OVERALL: If you're the kinda guy like me, that loves the Nerd enough to haul♥♥♥♥♥through some of the most difficult platforming you've ever played, and yes, even harder than Ninja Gaiden and Megaman Combined, mixed with fart jokes, Swearing up the♥♥♥♥♥ and absolutely love Platformers...this game is for you. It does the Nerd justice, and it's overly hard enough to where you feel pride welling up when you kick a boss's♥♥♥♥♥to the moon. It's an amazing experience that'll be worth that $15."

,Recommended,409660,26567459,"Posted: 12 November, 2016",all,Celery V. Green,"Angry Video Game Nerd II: ASSimilationis a traditional side-scrolling platformer, and the sequel to The Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures. I'm a big fan of the Nerd and I thoroughly enjoyed both games, so this is going to be a bit of a longer review:Overview- It's basically a different version (I'd call it an enhancement) of the original game. The same basic goal remains: The Nerd must once again rid himself of the horrible game he's found himself in, and save his world. Just like the first game, the story isn't complicated or important, and only serves as a vehicle for the Nerd's adventure to have a purpose, much like in some of the AVGN episodes.Gameplay- Is mostly the same as the first game, but with some tweaks and improvements. The Nerd can now wall jump and collect hidden upgrades to aid in his adventure, much like in the Mega Man X series of games. Another major change is that rather than having eight big stages and then the final stage, there's the tutorial stage, followed by five areas, each containing three smaller stages (which are unlocked in sequence) and a boss battle. It's similar to the first Sonic the Hedgehog, which had six Zones each with three Acts, and a Final Zone. You still get to pick which stage you want to tackle, and you can move from one area to the next before beating the boss of either. Some may prefer the first game's layout, but I thought this one was better because it caters to players who only want to play a little part of the game at a time, and don't want to be overwhelmed by one big stage they can't tackle yet. I do wish there was maybe one more area, but five areas plus the last stage isn't terrible.Arguably the biggest change is the difficulty; the original game was very tough and at various points quite unforgiving (ESPECIALLY the final stage). This game isn'taspunishing, but it's still far from a walk in the park, especially if you wish to tackle the higher difficulties. Some people complain about the overall difficulty of both games, but I don't quite understand; not only is there an Easy mode (which games in the '80s, as well as my early childhood of the 90s - early 2000s typically didn't have), but one shouldn't expect a game based off the AVGN to not be infuriating at points. This game's difficulty is much more balanced and even the final stage isn't too bad once you get the feel for it. You even get your lives replenished when you exit a stage, so there's no beating a level and then being short on lives for the next one. You can even quit a level if you're stuck, with no penalty other than having to start from the beginning the next time you play that level.Controls- The controls are basic but do what they're supposed to. They feel fluid and I never had a problem running, jumping or shooting when I wanted to. I played on a keyboard as well.Graphics and Sound- Again, similar to the design of the first game. They graphics are very colorful, pixelated and go a long way in making you feel like you're playing as the Nerd. The sound effects are good, and the soundtrack is just as great as the first AVGN game. I could listen to the Security Breach theme for hours.Performance- Probably the weakest link in the game for me. For the most part, the game runs great, but there are a few instances where there's so much stuff on the screen that you may experience significant stuttering or frame drops. This is most apparent on the Raw Fish Rampage stage, and since that stage auto-scrolls, this issue makes beating it in one shot considerably harder (and that stage is a hassle to begin with). Frame drops can sometimes be even when the game normally ran well just a while before.Overall, I had a lot of fun with this game, even more than I did the first; it felt like an overall improvement of an already very good game. The many references to the series of videos and movies made me feel like I was playing as the Nerd in his prime. If you're a fan of the Nerd, or you like very challenging platformers and don't mind the potential rage factor, this game is probably for you. I'd rather superglue my a--hole shut than not have this game in my library.Pros:Fun, challenging side-scrolling action; difficulty is challenging and (mostly) fairGreat retro graphics and excellent soundtrackThe rock weapon is actually useful in this gameCollectible power-ups and N-E-R-D cartriges add some replayability for achievement huntersSo many references to the AVGN series, as well as other games, which any fan will appreciateThe game is funnier than some of the more recent AVGN episodes (I'm looking at you, Toxic Crusaders)The game's subtitle, ASSimilation, is both a clever pun and a way better choice than something cliche like ""The Revenge"" or ""Revolution""YOLO difficulty was removed. What were they THINKING in the first game?ConsSome problems with frame drops, particularly in areas heavy with objects, flickering and/or enemiesThe game records your clear time after each level, but doesn't offer any sort of speed run mode, achievements, or any other incentive for beating levels fastThere's very nice remixes of a few tracks from the first AVGN game, but they didn't include one for Future F-ckballs 2010The game isn't terribly short, but certainly not a long game, especially with the much shorter individual levels compared to the first gameWhile there are many more individual stages than the first game, there's less variety in the enviornments, as there's only five main areas.Unless you care about earning most/all of the relatively short list of achievements, there isn't much else in the way of replayabilityNo more randomly generated ""I'd rather -"" or ""This game is -"" quotes upon death"
,Recommended,409660,25950792,"Posted: 9 October, 2016",all,Akka,"For people that thought the first one was too hardThe biggest complaint people had with the first game was that it was simply too difficult.The original game had nine sprawling levels, each capped off with a challenging boss. This one breaks each level into small segments, and in between your life count gets refilled to 20. In the original if you started a level with 4 or less lives you'd just intentionally die to reset your life counter.Cameos in this game aren't worked in as playable characers/items. Instead they're enemies and stage props. A couple characters and even famously bad games excluded from the previous game make their debut here. It's great that they included content the first game missed.However, the game feels a little bit too reserved. The unfair, pixel-perfect difficulty from the first game demanded a nearly surgical precision. In this game there isn't much challenge, even in finding the K O N G letters in each level. There's no suspense and nearly zero tension. Nowhere is that more apparent than the final boss I killed in one attempt. How many times did you die to Fred Fuchs in the prequel? There's no comparison.This game bears a lot of simlarities to the first. Pixelated gore, over the top explosions, homages to bad games, the humorous ire of a protagonist who hates his own game. Even so, this game left a much smaller impact. I left the first game feeling accomplished. This one just made me feel hollow in comparison."
,Recommended,409660,23226747,"Posted: 26 May, 2016",all,sarysa,"Much, much better this time around. The AVGN game series pays homage to classic games, particularly run-and-guns like Mega Man. It also is packed with watered down versions of some of the worst and nonsensical video game tropes, albeit without making the game a chore to play, as well as AVGN's own non-blocking commentary throughout the game.The first game was good, but suffered from overly simplistic controls and its short length. In this one, in lieu of multiple characters, you get direction locking for firing and permanent upgrades based on NES accessories the Nerd donned during various cinematic sequences. (particularly the Nerd vs. Rob the Robot) This really streamlines the overall experience as you don't have to fiddle with awkward character switches and sudden control changes as a result.As for its length, it's probably about 1.5x to 2x longer than the original, about equivalent to Mega Man X1-X3. There are 16 full-length levels (individual levels are shorter than in the original), the tutorial level (which is hilariously replayable), 8 miniboss fights in those levels including the tutorial one, and 6 boss-only levels for a total of 23. Your first run will probably last 2-3 hours but speedrunners could cut it to maybe 30-40 minutes or so, menus and cutscenes included.The soundtrack is a mix of old and new tracks, but its scope reflects the longer length of this title.Difficulty...it's almostobjectivelyeasier than the original. Hard (Old School) is the new Normal, since that difficulty still gives you kegs. (a secondary that recovers your health) The next difficulty (Hard as Balls) gives you only 2 beers and no kegs, (and nothing that replaces them either) shooting the difficulty of boss fights into the stratosphere.GAMEPADS: It seems they've added support for non-DirectInput gamepads, like the various SNES controller clones. AVGN 1 did not have this. Good for them for adding this support...it's a lot of fun playing an old-school game with a rigid dpad like NES/SNES had.Last but not least, the humor and meta-references are surprisingly strong considering how they blew through so much A-material in the first game. The AVGN movie, the ""feud"" with the Nostalgia Critic, and Board James are the three major untapped wells they drew from and it all came together pretty well. Nostalgia Critic plays a role similar to Break Man/Proto Man in Mega Man 3 (plus his pattern is very similar), though it ultimately goes in a very different direction.EDIT: One downside worth mentioning is it seems that boss patterns are way more RNG than in the first game. Minibosses and the Area 51 boss are especially RNG. This is somewhat compensated by ""easier"" high difficulty modes which give you more than 1 health and infinite continues, but it can become very frustrating nonetheless. This is still a minor issue.Needless to say, AVGN fans who like run-and-gun platformers should find this one enjoyable."

The original AVGN Adventures was insanely, impossibly hard, even by ""NES hard"" standards, and the death blocks were just a cheap way to create artificial difficulty for the player. This one does a much better job with making player deaths fair, usually if you get killed, it's because YOU made a mistake, not because the game decided to kill you. Also the Super Mario Bros. 3 style world map is a nice touch and there are plenty of collectibles and upgrades to find. All that being said, the game is still very short and can be beaten on normal within 2-4 hours. If you are a fan of old-school Mega Man style action games like me though, this is definitely worth picking up during a sale. I just wouldn't pay full price for it because of it's short length."

The first game, created by Clickteam Fusion 2.5,  is still a love-letter to the games of the NES era, specificially with the likes of Mega Man. However, the first game never seemed to have it's own identity due to the bland textures and unfairly difficult level designs. This sequel, though, improves on every level, and I am glad I pre-ordered it. The new game mechanics including the obtainable upgrades add more versitality to the Nerd, and thus, allows the stages to feature new- and more interesting- obstacles and designs that challenge your timing and coordination. By switching to the Unity Engine, Freakzone Games created a more visually-striking game. The color pallete makes the game stand out, and the retro-style lighting makes the game look beautifully retro. The story is just as lacking as in the first one, and the final boss,Death Mwauthzyx, returning from the AVGN Movie, feels uninspired as one stage theme is based on the movie. The sound track is just as great as the original, yet there's more variation to the tunes this time around. Overall, AVGN II: ASSimilation does a great job at fine-tuning out the problems of the original and creating a great, replayable, and overall fun experience. If AVGN 3 exists, I will buy it."

One of the problems that I had with AVGN adventures was that there wasn't much level design. It was just running and shooting. In this game however, each level felt different and fun. From one part, you're running and jumping, to riding a toy car, to being chased by an alligator, to flipping gravity, to colorizing a black and white level...Also, unlike the first game, there are 3 sections to each world, and a boss fight at the end.It reminds me a lot of Super mario land 2, because in SML2 you are collecting 6 golden coins to open the last level. In AVGN 2, you are collecting 6 pieces of the SEXFORCE (like a triforce, but with 6 pieces) to open up the last level.PROS- Fun level design- Funny dialogue- Upgrades and collectibles- Hard as hell- Great controlls- Just FUN- Replay value with completion and EXPERT difficulties (By expert i mean GOD LIKE)CONS- Can get a bit glitchy, but very rarely- Can be beaten in an hour without going for collectibles or upgradesOVERALL ----------- 8.5/10"

Unlike the previous game, this one has more playable levels and collectibles that you can find for 100% completion such as the Nerd's gear and NES cartridges that spell out NERD (akin to Star Coins in the New Super Mario Bros. series). The game is split into 5 worlds with 3 levels plus a boss level per area. Unlike the previous game, you can't play as different characters (BS Man, MotherF*cker Mike, and Guitar Guy), but you can find the Nerd's equipment scattered across the levels.  The Nerd's gear allow for permanent power-ups similar to upgrades in Mega Man and Metroid games. You can get a more powerful version of your starting weapon, a cape that allows your to glide in the air, shoes that allow for wall sliding and jumping, and all that. The levels reference AVGN obviously, with levels based off of the games he's reviewed such as TMNT, Hong Kong '97, and Castlevania 2. There are a lot other references too, such as the Nostalgia Critic serving a similar role to Proto Man in Mega Man 3, Cinemassacre's Monster Madness, James Rolfe's other series Board James, and the AVGN movie just to name a few. The music is amazing, being mostly chiptune tracks akin to 8 and 16 bit themes. The difficulty is much more lenient than AVGN Adventures and it only took me around 6 to 7 hours to beat the game on Normal mode.

God I hope the devs don't read this and actually do it. Oh no. Can you imagine?Pros and consPros:-The new powerups & upgrades.

At least give people the option to turn off some graphics options like the bloom or something like that! If my PC can run modern FPSs flawlessly there's no reason why an old-school style sidescroller should run like crap!I love the map system in this game, but if it's going to utilize such a map there should be more stages. They might as well have stuck with the Mega Man style stage select screen in the first one and made the levels longer.It's still a good game, I personally liked the first one better, but if you're an AVGN fan as I am, you'll like this game.

It slows down the framerate, you get headaches because of it referencing the Virtual Boy, fireballs that are impossible to avoid without jumping into instant death lasers, retractable spike walls that you have to get lucky to make it.

When you're on easy, you get only 50 to beat the stage in, and trust me, you're gonna need them.  The platforming is old school punishing, requiring perfect timing to get out alive.  Shame the same can be said of the bosses, which can be beaten quite easly (on easy mode, I was able to beat most of them without dying).  The humor is also spot on with the AVGN series, and the conflict with Nostalga Critic is also amusing.But there is one BIG flaw in this game.  The game's graphics have a much higher setup than the last game, which will cause lag and low frame rates on anything other than top of the line machines, making many stages more frustrating that challenging due to controls not regestering correctly due to lag.  I think this is probably due to the graphical effect many stages have (water effects, film grain, etc...), meaning that most run of the mill computers cannot handle many stages, and it will be more luck than skill to get you by (which is not how this should be, because when running at the proper frame rate, the controls are solid).  This lag can be much worse if you plan to record gameplay for Let's Play videos.So if you have a really good computer made to play high end games, pick it up.  If you have a standard computer system, wait for a patch to fix the lag, and/or some kind of graphics option."

Apart from that the gameplay is like the first game (Lots of dying).Graphics:AVGN 2, like the first game uses a classic retro art style but unlike the first game AVGN 2 gets a sort of filter over the game, I can't think of a way to describe it but in my opinion it works well and makes the game look even better. In the end, don't expect AAA graphics, it's a retro styled game.Music:The music in AVGNA was fantastic, the soundtrack was easily one of the best parts of the game and in my opinion AVGN 2's soundtrack is even better and a remix of one of the songs from the first game is even used is AVGN 2's soundtrack.Final Score:9.5/10, It's a fun game with challenge and an amazing soundtrack, if you are a fan of the Nerd I recommend this."

AVGN adventures 2 or Angry Video Game Nerd 2 introduces new mechanics that are not in the last game like wall jumping, solving puzzles that well involve buttons, More levels then the first game which only had I recall 7 levels, new bosses, a new great soundtrack, and this time you can collect all of the parts to the Nerd's suit like for exaple the NES controller cape and the super scope. Yet again I think its strictly AVGN fans because most of the jokes you need to watch I think now Cinemassacre in general because theres references to Board James, The AVGN Movie like its to me now not just AVGN its all of Cinemassacre.

,Recommended,409660,22168139,"Posted: 31 March, 2016",all,Rossmallo,"Okay, I am loving the hell out of this. This game is an improvement in ALMOST every way.First off, the fact that the game is split up into five three-level-one-boss worlds is a lot better than the nine single levels of the original. The benefits are many here - Better artistic cohesion, better music with motifs that can go from level to level, and the ability to space the gags and gimmics out better rather than trying to cram them all into a single themed level. Area 52 is a prime example of this. Different-but-similar music in each, and the levels each working with a different gimmick.Also, while it may seem a bit strange that we're down to only the Nerd as opposed to the switchable characters of before, I ended up liking this better, because in the original, some parts of levels could be utterly broken by some characters, so the levels had to accomodate for all of them. Not so with here - With one single character and one single line of upgrades - Yes, there's megaman-style upgrades this time around - the levels can be tuned far better. And they are.Also, the soundtrack is fantastic, even compared to the original. While there is a bit less variety this time due to the aformentioned themed worlds, they instead re-tweak the music to be different in each world's levels. For instance, Browntown's music gets faster and and harsher in each level. I love it.However, I have three minor complaints about the game.First off...The difficulty. No, not because it's difficult, that's what most people buy into this for...It's the exact oppsite. Normal is as brutal as it was before, but...Easy is an utterly staggering difficulty downstep. Enemies are weaker, you have more lives, and you only take half-bottles (hearts) of damage. So not only does this give you double your normal hp, this makes it so that each bottle of health-restoring beer gives you two hearts back. I found myself able to utterly facetank most of the bosses.And honestly? Part of me kinda thinks that's okay. Yeah, sure, this game is aimed at hardcore people, but being able to include less skilled people is totally fine. And trust me, no amount of health will help you in the final level. Good god....Though note that I said final level, not final boss. Thats my second complaint. Even accounting for me reaching that part on easy (Browntown's boss is too hard for me currently on normal), the final boss is utterly underwhelming, especially compared to the living nightmare that was Fred Fuchs in the original. The preceding level is insane though, so let that be your final challenge.And finally...The music. The music is mostly amazing...But one thing I kinda want... Browntown's music without the fart noises.Yeah. They incorporate fart noises as parts of the music in two tracks. While it DOES work, I kinda wanna hear it without that. Because those two tracks are wonderful.At any rate, TLDR: Great game, better than the original, STRONGLY reccomend you don't go down to Easy unless you utterly have to."

Where the first game had some great tracks, upon finishing this game, there was really only 1 or 2 that stood out. And its because they were mostly remixes of songs from the first game. Maybe this will change after another few playthoughs though.Playstyle: Think the first game with a few mechanics from Mega Man X mixed in. Now the nerd can wall jump/slide. Though this honestly clashes with one of the optional powerups of the game. So hopefully they will fix that sometime.Stages: Truth be told, I did have fun. However there were a few stages that, in the nerd's own words, made me go; ""What the hell were they thinking?!"" Particulary the 3rd stage on Area 52 and the 2nd to last stage of the game. You'll know what I mean when you get there. However some of them had some hillarious ideas.Difficulty:  The difficulty is back in this game. I played on the easy diffuculting which has gotten rid of the infinite lives in favor of a 50-lives per stage mechanic. While this still makes the game easy, it did have me stressing a little.  The wall jumping mechanic, while fun, can be a little wonky. Mostly with the optional powerup I mentioned earlier.Story: Boy meets girl, sire nerd, weird space stuff, nerd saves world, battle's nemsis.Dialoge: The nerd gets in some funny lines in the game. Also the ""Game over"" screen you got in the first game is gone. Which is a welcome relief after seeing it the last 200,000 times. Plus a couple other cameo's here and there. They made me buy that they were the characters they were representing, so overall dialog and writing are good for what it is.Value: TBH, unless your a diehard platform god who can speedrun this game with 1 life no continues blindfolded, id wait until it hits about 10$In short. I do not regret buying this, and had a great time. Just be prepaired to scream out obsenitys. Ya know, just like the nerd. :)Tl;dr: Go read the review you lazy bum.Real Tl;dr: Though it seems like i'm ragging on this game a bit, I did have fun and I do reccomend it.

If so, you'll love ASSimilation.Taking inspiration from several titles belonging to the old 8-bit console ASSimilation comes with several different levels that remind of the old-school titles.Movement is fluid and responsive, making the challenges in this game really fun to take.The music perfectly complements the action and gameplay.The difficulty of the game is vastly reduced compared to the first one, this due to the reduced amount of instant death-blocks all over the place. However the game still presents a fun challenge to beat and master. (Make sure to play on Old-school difficulty if you're used to old classics like Megaman on the NES)Bigger and better?The sequel vastly improves over the first tittle, for the most part.The level design really shines this time around having different level mechanics across the 5 different areas of the game. Water levels, gravity shifting, portals, helicopters, something like the mine carts from the Donkey Kong Country series. The levels are more fun to play this time.Collectibles on each level, upgrades that make the game more enjoyable and bosses that are not the same enemy with a different sprite!No additional playable characters this time, though. Something that could definitely be a good addition to the game. And I'll admit the collectibles are not that hard to get, don't add that much replay value and the upgrades even when useful, could have been better implemented into the levels. (it took 5 hours to finish the game with all the N.E.R.D collectibles, upgrades and no deaths on each level)Something for everybodyThe game obviously shines on its self-referencing humor, little nudges at several of the AVGN episodes and the staple humor of the Nerd.  But even if you're not a fan of the AVNG, you'll find the game enjoyable on its own right.Less death-blocks!!… Well, for the most partOne of the biggest complains about the first game was definitely its over-reliance in death-blocks to create cheap deaths and artificial difficulty, this time the game claims to include less of them, which is true for the most part. However, as you keep playing you'll notice that these blocks are still present on great part of the game and sometimes they're all over the place with just a different sprite, sometimes even recurring to old tricks, like those “appearing” blocks on the haunted level from the first game.The problem with the blocks becomes more apparent once you decide to go through the problem of completing levels without dying, a “Perfect” clear as the game calls it. You'll start noticing the placement, hitbox and recurrence actually starts to hinder the challenge making it more of a chore.What about the port?Well, you'll be glad to know that this time you can actually change the control configuration if you're playing it with a keyboard and it's pretty responsive too! You can also use a generic USB gamepad or an Xbox controller. Sadly still no resolution or video quality options.The goodCharming graphics and kick♥♥♥♥♥music.Definitely superior to its predecessorIntense and challenging old-school goodness.Staple AVGN humor.What could be improvedBetter implementation of the upgrades into the levelsDeath-blocks. They're almost there, though~Bring back additional playable characters and expand upon in.RecommendedWhile previously lacking an identity and just being nothing more than a weak parody, the games come back and becomes a solid platformer with lots of action and nostalgic value for those who love the challenges from the old 8-bit era.

But what really pisses me off is, that if you let go off the controller you still hold on to the wall. There are several games of this genre with this wall-slide mechanic (the most prominent is Mega Man X). In every one of this games you have to hold the control stick/d-pad against the wall to hold on to it and if you let go, you fall down straight, which is the reason I died 93485793875 times in this game.

,Recommended,409660,23032005,"Posted: 16 May, 2016",all,Final Contra,"I beat the game on normal difficulty in about an hour and a half.The nerd now gets upgrades instead of character switching, he can slide down walls like in Megaman X, and the stages are broken out into bite size levels that are comfortably finished in 3-4 minutes if you get a solid run. There's some laughs to be had and the levels and enemies are all tributes to the AVGN series. It's not nearly as good as the first game but it's still worth playing. I would definitely pick this up if you liked the first game but you thought it was too hard.With that in mind, my biggest complaint is that they weren't kidding when they said they made it easier than the first game. The level design is still a bit tricky but I managed to beat the game on normal without seeing the game over screen. They have higher difficulty options but that doesn't change the level design, it just gives you less health and the enemies noticeably more health. Spamming fire isn't fun. I started out on ""Hard as Balls"" before dropping down to ""Old School"" because I was blowing out my arm/elbow trying to spam faster... then I dropped it down to normal for the same reason after starting over and beating 2 bosses. Levels based around spamming fire as fast as you can have taken the spotlight over the first game's brilliant platforming. I'm honestly not convinced that you can beat the damnScrotorolevel on Hard As Balls without an auto fire controller. It's really that bad.They also removed the death screen that had a randomly generated nerd phrase which was quite possibly my favorite part of the first game. No more quotes about how he would rather have a hobo spit up his butt than play this♥♥♥♥♥♥infested game are waiting for you when you die. As trivial as it may seem, having the nerd also raging at the game along side you for a good laugh really was an amazing counterweight for the rage inducing levels.

(sighs and looks at the game) lets get it over with.Oh what in the ♥♥♥♥ its made by the same A holes, FreakZone Games, who made the first AVGN adventures game.Can't anyone make an official AVGN game that put gamers into a furious rage like in the first one?Well it starts off with me in my bed room playing more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ LJN games when all of a sudden my whole bedroom becomes a video game level, who the ♥♥♥♥ is this guy? Mike!?! WTF!?! He sounds like he ♥♥♥♥s people's mums with that 69ft♥♥♥♥♥♥of his.Oh he is the tutorial guy? oh just ♥♥♥♥ing die pls just ♥♥♥♥ing die. Games these days always have to force tutorials or training modes to players, man up you little ♥♥♥♥♥es go play some real manly games (Throws ♥♥♥♥ing Contra at you).OK the tutorial is over and who the ♥♥♥♥ is this in my game, Nostalgia Critic, oh why the ♥♥♥♥ must you antagonize me again dont you have anything better to do. You can forget doing the 2nd tmnt review you ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Ok beaten the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the critic and now where the ♥♥♥♥ am it? oh super mario bros 3 style overworld.And there is only 3 levels per area with a bonus one being a boss round.... mmm but wait just 3 levels per area then this mean this game is bat♥♥♥♥♥♥hard... or maybe not... (cries) I've been tourturing myself with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games for over 10 years now so please dont let these levels♥♥♥♥♥♥me off even more than the first game.So I'm in a chinese slash japanesse themed level playing a remix to Hong Kong 97, REALLY!?! oh was the song really that catchy to deserve a remix? it isn't.And holy♥♥♥♥♥♥I get to ride a giant flaming tanuki and i get to destroy enemies with his gigantic testicles ohhh kick ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥:D.The boss of this area is some cat robo or whatever just stomping around droping generic sea food at me but she/it is no problem to take down..... huh? you know in the first game all levels you pick were hard as balls but in this one the difficulty seems to be toned down a bit, I haven't died once yet which is a suprise. I was expecting this game to be ♥♥♥♥ing impossible.Lets try another one before we wrap up this review just so i dont spoil too much.Ohh okay lets see here.... (looks at the sewer map with disgust) ♥♥♥♥ it lets play it.Great as if the original nes tmnt game couldn't get any ♥♥♥♥♥ier now i have to deal with rat♥♥♥♥♥♥and♥♥♥♥♥♥water rising up and down. I've had enough of♥♥♥♥♥♥and♥♥♥♥♥♥but its time to swim through it again.Cool I can swim, kind of reminds me of Tails in Sonic 3 and Knuckles who is personally the best character to control because he can fly and swim through stages with ease but oh no no you can't just swim through this level so easily like in that game you need to pay attention not to bump into death blocks, killer poo fish, deep sea divers with drills like in that Bioshock game I used to see advertised everywhere years ago there are also these underwater mines W-W-W-WHAT!?!WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ ARE THERE UNDERWATER MINES IN A ♥♥♥♥ING SEWER!? wouldn't these cause a huge problem for the city above wouldn't that destroy roads and♥♥♥♥♥♥(dies to a mine) oh nooo they one shot you just like those death blocks in the first game.Actually in this sequel there isn't that many of them unlike the first game where there was a ♥♥♥♥ing massive bunch of these ♥♥♥♥ing blocks everywhere.Now im at the boss section of the sewer area and its 3 battle turtles, they are very easy to beat you kill them only to get jumped on by Master Splinter who one shots you but he is so easy to counter that he goes down in one shot to.How about have ♥♥♥♥ing April O Neil here so I can shoot her for not supporting me in the NES game.... ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥.Well thats as far as im going with this review.In short: the game is easier than the first game due to less death blocks and the game doesn't give you cheap deaths the graphics and music is better to and you can still buy the ost right now."

None of the bad things the Nerd has ever complained about can be found. Controls, hit detection, physics, level design, all near flawless. And they also threw in quite a few improvements over the first game.+ More levels+ Collectibles+ Cameos, both from James' stuff and from other games+ More actions: wall jump, glide, punch, charge shot+ Fewer death blocks+ Shorter wait before respawn- Unable to wall jump at bottom of walls- The 5 worlds differ too much in difficulty- No Death Mecha Christ9 out of 10, marvelous."

,Recommended,409660,29052919,Posted: 5 January,all,SergeXIII,"A major improvement on the first installment (which I liked for the record).  The challenge is intense and fair with only a few exceptions.  You aren't going to find nearly as many instant death blocks this time around.  Furthermore, this time instead of unlocking extra characters that you'll never use and cameos that are only worth a chuckle, the secrets that you'll find are significant and have heft.AVGN 2 is to AVGN 1 as Megaman X is to Megaman 7."

Trying a super mario world like map with the ability to replay a level for collectibles is great creates a feel like the retro games that he reviews. The difficulty of the levels and bosses is better balanced than the first game. Few problems, the character movement is off compared to the first and I miss the switching between different characters to reach certain objects or areas that gave the first a more puzzle solving aspect (though could argue that is what the power up like loafers and the cape are for, but the different characters was more effective way to convey that)."

It increases your chances in beating the game & save money on broken controllers & such. With that said, there is this here.
