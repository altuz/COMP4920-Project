,Recommended,409710,32165519,Posted: 3 June,all,tinyrants,"As a first-time player of the game, I was deeply satisfied with the graphics, which are great due to bugs being fixed. Gameplay-wise, I enjoyed the vast assortment of weaponry which I thought was only possible in some RPG's and magic games. This, combined with FPS gameplay made the game more memorable with the right atmosphere for a game so graphic, with very fitting visuals and background noises/music. Though the hacking is very troublesome and time-taking, it gives you a sense of dread as time slowly runs out. If you have wanted to freeze your enemies whole, send an electric blast, or send an army of insects while equipped with a machine gun, this is the game you do not want to miss out on. If you do not enjoy FPS games or are easily disgusted by graphic visuals, then you do not have to play it. Thank you for reading my first review."

However this remaster version is nothing more than a waste of money and memory on your computer.Frequent bugs I had while playing:- When the game launches I can't press any button or move the mouse or it will fail to launch and crash.- Spawning extra big daddy's and little sisters and then crashing because of it- Making enemy shadows visible through walls- Making enemies run away from me, just against a wall or in circles- Continiously repeating voice recordings or playing old recordings when I pick up a new one.- Other sound glitches: Corpses talking, guns firing,...- Splicers just standing still, or on their spawn point to ""ambush me""- When continiously firing with the machine gun, damage isn't recorded. To do damage I had to tap fire.- When I crouch, sometimes my movement speed will be limited to crouch speed until I reload a safe file.- Moving everything. Every interactable object is floating on the floor moving in random directions, even splicer corpses, med packs or big daddies corpses.These were the only bugs I could think of (aka happened in the last 4 hours I played) after receiving another moodruining crash.Conclusion: if you have both the remaster and original version I would recommend to just play the original version. The gala of bugs and crashes is just not worth it. Even if you save regularly because of the bugs like I do. Sometimes you just get so into the game that you forget and in an instant an hour of exploration is gone because of a crash.This remaster get's a 2/10.Original game get's a 9/10"

Is a PC player not entitled to the well done port?'No!' says the man in Sony, 'It belongs to the PS4.' 'No!' says the man in Microsoft , 'It belongs to XB1.' 'No!' says the man in 2K, 'It belongs to consoles.' I rejected those answers; instead, I chose something different. I chose the impossible. I chose... other games, games where the player would not fear lack of FOV slider, where the settings tuner would not be bound by petty video settings, Where the great Master Race would not be constrained by the console peasants! And with well done PC ports, other games can become your favourites as well.Update:recent patch added FOV slider, call me when they fix awful mouse behavior, I can't be arsed to re-download it just to be disappointed again"

,Recommended,409710,31760300,Posted: 14 May,all,Pyxel Pengu,"===FIX FOR GAME CRASHES IN REVIEW===I wasnt going to write a review on this game, but I saw all of the negative feedback due to performance issues so I decided to defend the game. The game itself is amazing and looks gorgeous. If you have ever played bioshock in the past or have any interest in the game, then i highly recoomend it. The major issue though with the remastered edition of both bioshock 1 and 2 however, is that the game does constantly crash. THIS CAN BE FIXED by going into your steam directory for the game (Steam\steamapps\common\BioShock Remastered\Build\Final), locate the BioshockHD.exe file, right click it, go  to the compatibility tab and make sure to check ""Run in 640 x 480"" (this doesnt affect actual game resolution), ""Override high DPI scaling"", and ""Run this program as administrator"". The game will look alittle strange when launching the game but it does seem to fix the issue with the game crashing as i have not had any crashes with 1 or 2 after doing this. It does not however fix the issue with steam cloud saves so all game saves will be on your local machine.I definatly would recommend this game to anyone but because of the inconvenience of having to manually fix the game for it to run properly, I would recommend only picking up if the game goes on sale."

The only negative things i can say about this are:- Why do we need both Bioshock and Bioshock Remastered? Makes no sense.- Enemies glitch out sometimes, Ex: A Leadhead Splicer had his head kept rapidly moving up and down while running away.- Some textures didn't load in all of the way, Ex: the statue in the beginning with Andrew Ryan's head on it and the face didn't load all the way in and it looked like he was wearing a rubber mask. It's the same with all of the other statues too.Everything else looks amazing and overall so far the game is pleasurable and very atmospheric, i reccomend it to all."

,Not Recommended,409710,25664514,"Posted: 23 September, 2016",all,Warhawk,"This is how my experience with Bioshock Remastered went whilst I was doing an achievement run (trying to get them all in one playthrough like I did on the original Bioshock 2): I started a game on Hard, and it crashed when I looted the first Splicer, resetting all of my settings and forcing me to restart the game and watch all of the cutscenes again. I then started a new game on Hard and got all of the audio diaries and tonics on Medical Pavilion, and it crashed just before I fought Steinman, erasing my quicksaves, settings, and forcing me to reload my autosave at the beginning of Medical Pavillion. I then proceeded to get all of the audio diaries and tonics on Medical Pavilion again and reached Neptune's Bounty, only to realize that the game had for some reason changed the difficulty of my playthrough to Medium after loading the autosave, rather than Hard (thereby forfeiting my ability to get the 'Beat the game on Hard' achievement for the playthrough). I then restarted the game completely on Hard, raced through Medical Pavilion again while getting all of the audio diaries and tonics, and was 1 room away from reaching the bathysphere to the next level before it crashed on me again. Once again my quicksaves were erased, my settings were reset, and the only thing available was an autosave that put me back to the beginning of Medical Pavillion (on Normal rather than Hard once again). Fortunately this time I had backed up a copy of the quicksave file that had the vast majority of Medical Pavilion on Hard complete, and I proceeded to replace the current file with it. However, this didn't work, and the game still only recognized my autosave.And like many others have reported, the game consistently had major freezes/stutters, audio glitches (skipping and repeating), props occasionally disappearing and reappearing, and terrible mouse acceleration.Thus I can safely conclude that Bioshock Remastered is currently unplayable. DO NOT buy this game (or even try to install it if you were given it for free) until 2K releases some solid crash and stability fixes for the game."

Just talking from my own experience, I didn't experience any crashes before and after the update. But the stupid mouse-acceleration is finaly gone, this is something that I gladly notice. There are some more fixes, so some of the negative reviews might be outdated now.To the game itself: well, its exactly the same game as the original BioShock from 2007. Dense atmosphere, beautiful level design and pretty fun shooter gameplay (weapons and ""magics""). And it gets something right that many horror games get wrong: It still knows to excite after you get used to the ""scare-mechanics"" thanks to the crazy characters and the thrilling plot. There were other horror-shooters like F.E.A.R. or Resident Evil...they actually got boring fast when you knew how the scares worked.If you like Shooters like Half-Life2 or Metro2033, and if you like horror where humans are drawn to madness in disastrous situations, then you should totally check out BioShock.EDIT: For Germans like me it's not the exact same game actually, because we get the uncensored version this time.

,Not Recommended,409710,33413115,Posted: 9 July,all,Big Bird III,"Amazing game, buried at sea (aka 'The Plane Wasn't The Only Thing That Crashed')As much as it pains me to say (because the story, setting, music, and gameplay are excellent), severe issues make it difficult to recommend Bioshock Remastered in it's current state (as of July 2017). Crashes are frequent and sometimes result in deleted saves. If you insist on playing this game now, be prepared to babysit your saves and redo sections you've already completed.Pro Tip:Save every 5-10 minutes or so, then move your save file out of the default directory: C:\Users\ProfileName\Documents\BioshockHD\Bioshock\SaveGames\Below is a list of issues as I encountered them in my full play-through of the game.Crash on Save #1: Occured while saving my progress (deleting the file)Event Viewer Description:Faulting application name: BioshockHD.exe, version: 1.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x584f535bFaulting module name: MSVCR110.dll, version: 11.0.51106.1, time stamp: 0x5098858eException code: 0xc0000005Fault offset: 0x0000df22Faulting process id: 0x2bcFaulting application start time: 0x01d2f4500a0a6894Faulting module path: C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\MSVCR110.dllReport Id: fa6f5628-2ba6-4b86-a476-21faa2c94e53Crash on Loading a New Area #1: Occured when Loading the Smuggler's Hideout areaEvent Viewer Description:Faulting application name: BioshockHD.exe, version: 1.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x584f535bFaulting module name: MSVCR110.dll, version: 11.0.51106.1, time stamp: 0x5098858eException code: 0xc0000005Fault offset: 0x0000df22Faulting process id: 0x2e34Faulting application start time: 0x01d2f8304be7f271Faulting module path: C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\MSVCR110.dllReport Id: 11b9b858-2e5e-4a07-a3d0-d163df80fd32Black Screen when attempting to Load a Save File or Continue gameThe Main Menu shows up, but I'm unable to successfully Load any of my Save Files. The screen just goes to black while the music continues playing in the background.Update and FixI narrowed things down and it seems the problem is related to the actual name of the save file. I was adding numbers to keep track of my quicksaves (ex. QuickSave605.bsb). Removing the numbers allowed the save to load again. Re-adding numbers to the file name reproduces the loading error (i.e. black screen with music).The adventure continues...Map menu Lags (but only when playing with a controller)This is a weird one. If you use keyboard and mouse controls,  the map comes up almost instantly. If you use a controller, the lag when calling up the map menu is immediately noticeable (a couple of seconds delay).Game Locks Up somewhat randomly when bringing up the Map (but only when playing with a controller)Trying to bring up the map caused the game to hang (it just went to a black screen). First time experiencing this issue, although I haven't been making much use of the map feature before now.UpdateThe game locked up again in a completely different area of the game. I was trying to reference the map to help me locate sections I hadn't visited yet. It's a pain, since you have to Ctrl+Alt+Del, then log out of your Windows session to exit the game (i.e. it won't allow you to force quit the game, or Steam, etc.). I'll see if I can narrow down why it happens, and steps to reproduce the error.So after a bit of testing, I'm able to semi-consistently reproduce the error by loading up a save file and bringing up the map screen, flipping between the tabs, and closing the map screen, repeating as necessary. Something interesting though, I tried reproducing the same issue using keyboard and mouse controls (I've been playing with an xinput controller up to this point), and the issue doesn't seem to exist when played this way. Could be a placebo effect, but saving hasn't crashed the game so far either. I feel pretty confident the root of the map lag and crash issues are in the controller implementation or something about the way the buttons are displayed on the map screen. I'll play without a controller for a bit to see if any of the issues come back up.Didn't run into issues while playing with a keyboard and mouse, but I had the game crash on me again while attempting to Quick Save (deleting my progress).Game-breaking Glitch in Fort FrolicThere's an objective where you need to take out all the goons rushing you by the staircase. All the doors are locked so you can't escape until you kill everybody. The game didn't trigger the next sequence (made sure everyone was dead) and I was left locked in the area for good. Had to load a previous save file and redo everything to get past it.Crash on Save #2: Occured while saving my progress (deleting the file)Event Viewer Description:Faulting application name: BioshockHD.exe, version: 1.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x584f535bFaulting module name: MSVCR110.dll, version: 11.0.51106.1, time stamp: 0x5098858eException code: 0xc0000005Fault offset: 0x0000df22Faulting process id: 0x1948Faulting application start time: 0x01d2fb6c411957b6Faulting module path: C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\MSVCR110.dllReport Id: 82be47ac-f72f-4647-8369-ea5b74b4592fI'm left to assume this issue lies in the MSVCR110.dll file within Windows 10, so I'm going to try some troubleshooting. I copied the msvcr110.dll file from C:\Windows\SysWOW64\ into the C:\Windows\System32 folder. The files had different timestamps so I stuck with the newer file. Who knows if it'll work, but if it fixes the issue that's why.UpdateThe game boots and I've been playing for hours.

,Not Recommended,409710,25582581,"Posted: 18 September, 2016",all,ThatDarnOwl,"Bioshock Remastered is a pretty big disappointment.The original Bioshock was a great game but it didn't age that well to be perfectly honest. The switching between plasmids was kind of clunky and the game even had ironsights but they didn't really do anything. It's a game that could have been tweaked and turned into something truly special and modern.This didn't do that. It just upped some of the textures, added the previously exclusive DLC from the PS3 version and called it a day. It feels more like a port to next generation consoles than an actual ""remaster"". The game still contains the same bugs as the original and has half as many graphics options.Thankfully, 2K didn't remove the original Bioshock from the store. And you get it free if you buy this version. But the only reason I can think of to play this version is to try out the PS3 exclusive DLC. Apart from that, it's a worse version in general and feels too much like a missed opportunity. Bioshock is a game I think would be excellent to remake, and this feels too much like an apathetic publisher trying to fill a quota."

THAT IS IT!- And now for the most annoying feature, when you are in the main/pause menu, you mouse will get stuck over some buttons and not others and this is completely random. I have to vigorously swipe across my desk to move my mouse to a different button of a menu.- And finally, to put the cherry on top, mouse acceleration is forced on with no options to turn it off.EW!I am writing this with only a few minutes played and this is already what I have found. I thought this would be a better port considering Infinite was pretty decent.DO NOT buy this game before most of these problems are fixed."

The rest fits into the game as ambient music and is hardly recognizable when listen to it separately.The highlight:* Fort Frolic with Cohen Sanders.Verdict:I’m still salty that the Bioshock world was build around a “Run and Gun” game with RPG elements as opposed a fully fledged RPG. A RPG in the heydays of Rapture, witnessing the conflicts and the downfall, which leads to the destruction of that society.While the Bioshock world is crafted very well, it didn’t age that well gameplay wise. This further proves by the global achievement statistics, ~60% didn’t even beat the first boss, ~85% didn’t reach the mid-game.It’s a 7 out of 10 for me."

Textures are a little different, not necessarily better and the game overall looks the same as the original except for the opening sequence when you travel down to Rapture. In that sequence they didn't really improve graphics, they just added more crap on the screen (George Lucas Remastered Special)... things like sea-weed, Starfish, Jellyfish, etc. Only thing missing was a square sponge.So why should you buy this version? Can't give you one! I'm happy I received it for free, but I wouldn't purchase it considering the settings they cut and it not looking much better than the original.

A big plus which I really didn't expect, is the fact that the Remastered version comes free to anyone who owns the original Bioshock on Steam (same for Bioshock 2). This was a very decent move by 2K knowing that the original version doesn't have Steam achievements worked in, but there is just still so much that needs to be fixed.The worst issue I've encountered by far are the crashes. They seem to occur sporadically and are usually occompanied by a drop in fps (frames per second). If it was just a simple problem of the game crashing then it would at least be bearable, but every crash I've encountered has resulted in loss of my most recent saves, along with all of the game settings being reset to default. Even if you save frequently it appears the save files revert to the last time the game was exitted, and the settings that revert include graphics, audio, and gameplay (every setting in the options menu). Not only has this meant losing hours of progress, but I've also had to restart the game because even the difficulty setting reverts to ""medium"", even if the game was started on ""survivor"" difficulty. On top of this there are also a few lighting glitches, and a bug where you can get locked out before Fort Frolic and have to reload an old save, but they're just minor annoyances in comparison.So, tl;dr:-Steam achievements - good.-Free to people who own the original - good.-BUT be careful about losing save files, AND-Achievement hunters may have a tough time with the hard mode/ survivor mode achievements.Will update if/ when all this is fixed. I am still enjoying the game (see below), but I wouldn't recommend buying it just yet.Note - there is a work-around you can do to solve the whole difficulty setting issue; navigate to your AppData\Roaming\BioshockHD\Bioshock folder, make a backup of the Bioshock.ini file (just in case), then open it up in notepad and add the following text under the big block of settings after ""[Perobjectconfig]"":[ShockGame.ShockUserSettings]GameDifficulty=GD_EXTREMENoVitaChamber=TrueIf you already have a section for ""[ShockGame.ShockUserSettings]"", then just add/ change the values. What it should do is set the difficulty to survivor mode (GD_EXTREME) and turn of vita chambers every time the game is started up. You might be able to do the same with graphics, audio and game control settings, but I haven't tried so not sure. As for the crashing and losing saves, the only advice I can give is to save and close the game down after getting past difficult areas. Can't guarantee that it works though."

The game really angered me.Overall (tl;dr):Gameplay feels fair and is fun, everything works from this perspective, except for the Big Daddies (on hardest difficult) which are unbalanced and broken. Which isn't enough of a reason to avoid the game on its own but combined with the sound issues, constant crashes and lack of auto-save to stop you from losing hours of progress - you should give the game a miss until they're solved. Obviously if you feel like you can deal with manually saving every 5 mins then I'd recommend the game.The game looks good and runs well, gameplay and mechanics are great (except for one glaring issue) and the world is dripping with atmosphere. Therefore, it's such a goddamn shame that the game is overshadowed by its inability to work properly. There are a few problems here ranging from minor to extremely annoying;- Sound doesn't work unless you go into the default config and change the channels from 128 to 64.- The only type of sound settings you can run is stereo or the sound will just not work.- Auto-Save only triggers at the start of every level, which shouldn't be a grievance but is exacerbated by this next issue...- Constant crashes, we're not talking every 5 mins but every 50 minutes and for no apparent reason than the game decided that it had enough of running and wanted to take a nap. I'm torn between which frequency of crashes I would prefer in this game, because while the game is still technically playable I have played about 4 hours and have lost about 1.5hs progress because of crashes. Obviously you can manually save every 5 minutes but the game can be so immersive that 1 hour slips by in the click of your fingers and having to constantly manually save because of fear of crashing is something you really shouldn't have to do in a game. Having to retread levels because you forgot to save is such a chore but not as bad as having to repeat a fight with a Big Daddy.- Big Daddies. Serving as walking tanks effectively, these guys protect Little Sisters which carry Adam that you use to buy upgrades. To get to the Sisters you have to go through the Daddies. Playing on the Hardest Difficulty highlights the Daddies' cheap design (particularly the ones armed with a Rift Cannon), they have WAY too much health and will two shot you. Every time I have come across one it's a battle of attrition, with unlimited respawns it's all about running at the Daddies and unloading until they die or you run out of ammo. I'd guess that my shortest fight with one was about two-three minutes and longest was upwards of seven. I have nothing against a fight like this, I have played plenty of Dark Souls, the issue however is that you cannot dodge their attacks unlike in Dark Souls. The result is hoping that you don't get hit twice in a row so you don't have to make the track back from respawn to them, there is no counter play here. Going into these fights well prepared doesn't seem to offer much advantage except shortening the fight and maybe saving you some supplies of health, ammo or eve. Setting some traps for them, staying out of LoS and peaking them is your best bet against them. However, in every fight you're probably going to die, if you don't then everything went perfect for you. It's a pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥realisation that you have to get lucky to walk out of one of those fights without losing a majority of your supplies. What's even worse is that they are in every level more than once and randomly placed as they wander through it. You'll never feel more hopeless in the game then when you just defeated one and another walks around the corner with that last little sister of the level but you have all of 1 health pack left, 2 bullets and some harsh words to use against it. Although technically optional, you can choose to not engage them but this means ignoring the icon of the game and avoiding your supply of Adam which is the life blood (literally) of the world, you cannot simply ignore such a key feature of this game."

One autosave and 2 saves that you alternate between. You will at most lose 4 minutes of play. Just don't forget to save after every 1-2 rooms and definitely after every step of every objective. The more you save, the less you're going to have to redo when it crashes.Also, very important. Play in 1080p. The crashes largely have to do with memory, UI problems, and save problems. Playing in 1080p will reduce most of the crashes. When I was in 4k, I was crashing every 5-10 minutes. 1080p is every 2 hours. Save before you handle any hints, maps, or buying from shops.

The only thing I saw as a Problem was that the Mouse was still as badly as it was in the original game. I figured Number 2 for the sensitvity is the best setting to get used to. Also I noticed that you can't turn the Bloom off but you will get once again used to that very quickly.Otherwise I am honestly very happy with this Game. It has an amazing Story with 3 different Endings, so it does make a difference on how you play the Game, which also gives the Game replayabiltiy. I finished the Main Story in 11.9 hours and it was a gorgeous game with lovely Characters and nice Voice Acting.Unlike the Original Game, the Remastered Version is uncut in Germany, which made to me a huge difference. I have played the cut version before and noticed after playing this game they have been cutting out alot of the Story. I am glad this Version however is uncut and I get to play the full BioShock experience.As I mentioned before the Mouse Controls took me a while to get used to but once I got used to it, I could enjoy one of the best Games made in Singleplayer History.I expect that this Game will get a few updates that will fix for other people the crashes.Which is why I do recommend this game to you, however if you would like to wait until most of the bugs are fixed (just incase you are one of the unlucky ones or got an older pc/laptop) then just get this game later on, when its on Sale.20€ also does seem to me as a fair price since you can play the Games 3x over to get all the other Endings but its ofcourse never a Mistake to wait until it goes on Sale.May I also mention this game has a FOV Slider and Trading Cards, which is to me a huge plus."

,Not Recommended,409710,25522759,"Posted: 15 September, 2016",all,Brian C. (The Schmaltzy Cynic),"[This game was free as of PC upgrade deal for both BioShock 1 and 2, and this review will focus solely on the changes and new features of the Remastered games. If you want a review on BioShock 1, I have one here:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/recommended/7670]Until this version of the game is signficantly patched and addresses its many problems carried over from the original version on PC, I cannot recommend this game. It's a damn shame because the Survivor mode is perhaps my favorite new feature for the series--and it's only in this game, not BS2 or Infinite.For anyone defending this port or calling out disgrunted fans as being entitled, the original port was unnacceptable BUT could be understood with the disruption of GFWL. Infinite turned out to be a great port, so any defenses for BioShlock Retextured is inexcusable. They had their second chance, and they delayed this game for PC users.""It's A Sin To Tell A Lie"" : Common Issues & Unresolved Issues of the OriginalThe first major bug I came across is the drowning at the intro cinematic. It's either tied to the FOV, framerate or other graphic options features--which are anisotropic filitering from x1 to x16 and AA on or off--but it can be resolved if you set all the settings down to the lowest value AND you turn off the horizontal FOV expanded option. Once you reach the surface, you can turn them all on or you'll fall through the water.Second, there is no FOV slider or option. Like the original, you will have to open up the Default.ini file and change the SetFOV to your preference, THEN you need to bring up %appdata% to find BioShock.ini to add to ""w = MoveForward"" with ""w = MoveForward | SetFOV = X""--I have found to get a significant performance boost by making these two changes.Third, there are audio desync issues, and reported by other users there are the same issues with the original's audio. I don't know of a fix for this, so I hope it gets patched.  Including these bug issues there are also gameplay bugs of all sorts like missing textures, and the mouse sensitivity issues are still here and it's practically mandatory that you turn on the aim adjustment option if you mess with the FOV.Lastly, and probably the most aggregious, the ""Save When You Exit"" bug of BioShock 2 that corrupted your saves is still apparent, so always manually save and quit. NEVER use the save and quit option.Survivor Mode, the Best Addition to the Series, & Other FeaturesIt's a shame that these issues, as well as general optimization problems--which I've had much better experiences with DOOM (2016) and Mankind Divided to give me the impression that this game isn't optimized well--are detracting me from some of the better qualities of this game.The weakest of the list are the three new challenges, which are interesting little things but would be better to make those a part of the main game. Another weak bonus is the Director's commentary. While they are insighful from the videos I've seen, they are 5 - 8 min long (with gameplay footage edits) that are too much of a pace-breaker. They should be viewable from the main-menu so you don't have to hunt for them, and watch them, in-game.None of the gameplay fixes of BioShock Infinite or BioShock 2's controls are included in this game, which is perhaps something I would be more angered by if it wasn't for the new difficulty mode, Survivor Mode. It begins with a stupidly high difficulty curve with Splicers taking more than seven wrench hits before the benefits of the new difficulty become more obvious. You'll realize this when you get your gun and can kill with a single headshot, and you get the Wrench Jockey to make the wrench more viable--and that's only the beginning of the changes.Ammo, resources, enemy damage and AI behaviors, usage of eve, and the value for items, eve, etc. are all ramped up to provide the type of difficulty that works best for BioShock: Resource Management. This makes not only the planning, tactical side of the mediocre gameplay work better but makes the RPG (and ""morality"" system) stronger by making ""every bullet [(and resource)] count!""(As an added aside note, developers, stop making the BEST mode of the game tied to the hardest difficulty. There is a reason people love Ranger Mode from the Metro series and Hardcore Mode from Fallout New Vegas, and not the Survival Mode of F4; we like to have difficulty modifiers to our preferred difficulty so we can gradually adjust and get better to the changes.)This difficulty inclusion is the only reason, aside from the new textures, I would ever recommend this version over the original because the original can be fixed while this one remains to be seen if 2K or modders will come to the rescue.""The Best Things in Life Are Free!""Apparently after 9 years that adage cannot be said to always be true. Come back to this game when it has its issues sorted out because there is something worthwhile to play that will warrant your return.And for any neighsayers, know that if you got the game redeemed by the developers it will probably not count toward the review metrics on Steam (as it was a copy given by the developers) according to Steam's new policy.One disgrunted, disappointed fan won't ruin 2K's day; the many who expected more will ruin 2K's days to come."
,Not Recommended,409710,26192997,"Posted: 23 October, 2016",all,Superslayer,"BioShock: Remastered or Re-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized?What the remaster devs did right: They added new higher polygon models and higher res textures to almost everything in the game, the post processing effects are much sharper and overall better looking here than in the original, and now there's anti-aliasing for those who hate jagged edges everywhere. Furthermore, new assets were added to increase the level of detail in some scenes making the game look more modern, this is very apparent in the opening descent into Rapture, good show Blind Squirrel Games.What they did wrong: They compressed the original's outstanding audio, meaning the game doesn't sound as crisp and haunting as it originally did. That is a big shame since audio is key to this games atmostphere, tone and a big part of the overall experience. There are also bugs in the Remaster that didn't happen in the original (enemies ignoring you, delayed reaction in animations, for example, freeze someone then have them actually stop moving more than a second after they're supposed to be frozen), audio cutting out, skipping or doubling over itself, mouse acceleration issues, graphical oddities (textures not loading properly causing blurry low res ones in their place) and an overall lack of polish on a product that was released over 9 years ago in a working state. To top this off, bugs that were in the original version of the game have not been addressed in the slightest in the remaster... oh boy.“A man chooses, a slave obeys”. I urge you to choose to play the original and not this remaster, unless all of the issues listed above are fixed, as well as different ones other people have reported (such as numerous crashes & mouse issues) I cannot at the moment recommend this version of the game. If you already own the original BioShock and have this one as a free download, try it out and make your own conclusions, that's what I did.

Killing enemies feels very solid as they dont get killed to easy nor are bullet sponges. There is no live minimap that shows you were to go whick makes this game more demanding and makes you work to get from a to b so you have to listen carefully to every Voxophone. Overall the Gameplay is Very Nice (8,5/10)Story:I am not going to tell anything from the Story mainly because of Spoilers.The Characters are flawless every boss/character has his own marks and past which shows how deep the story is.Andrew Ryan and Atlas are characters that wouldve probably won an oscar if this was a movie.The Story is legendary cant add anything else (10/10)Graphics:Now the Original Game looks a little dated nowadays mostly the character models (splicers).With the Remaster i think they did a very good job. Still kept that ""Magic"" the game had plus adding better lighting, textures, resolution and overall effects. (8,5/10)Performance:Personally i had almost no Problems with any Version of Bioshock 1 or Bioshock 2, had only 2 crashes in 16 hours of Gameplay which is Very good considering the amount of Bad reviews this Game got because of this issue.Performance in game was very good. Played it on 3 different devices (i7 4790 plus gtx1070 , Amd fx6300 gtx760 and on a laptop intel i5 5200u intel 5500hd) in every device i got better performance that expected. (9/10) for me*Price:The Game is faily cheap on sale sometimes, about 6 or 7 euros.Ofc you can find it a little cheaper on other sites but steam is always the Best.(10/10)Content:10 to 18 Hours of Gameplay only Story plus 3 free DLC game modes and the abilty to visit the Museum plus the Opinion of directors of the Game.(9,5/10)Can only recommend this Game to anyone that loves deep stories.Sidenote:I have finished every Bioshock about 2 times on Console.Havent really touched all the DLCs tho."

,Recommended,409710,33759186,Posted: 23 July,all,Mr. Underhill,"This review comes from the perspective of someone who didn't play this game when it's hype was going strong about a decade ago and who has managed to avoid being fully spoiled on all plot details. I also did not experience the crashing issues that some seem to be having, so I can't speak to that matter (I think it may have crashed once, and it might have even been caused by Steam when it happened).+ The remastered version does a decent job of bringing the game's graphics up to something close to current gen or at least the generation prior. Graphics and the underwater atmosphere were a major selling point of this game when it first came out and, although not nearly as attention grabing as it might have been back in the day, you still very much get the sense of being in an underwater city, complete with glimpses of flora and fauna and the occassional leak. I found very few things that broke that immersion. Sounds and occasional but strategically-placed music tracks are also used to excellent effect.+ The plot is the sort where you walk into a post-apcolyptic world (on a smaller scale than, say, Fallout) and must attempt to piece together what happened, in this case with the assistance of a ""mission control""-type guide who claims to need your help to escape. The famous plot twist with Andew Ryan is suitably impactful and should be cause for thought days after finishing the game (if you managed to avoid being spoiled on the plot for this long, anyway).- The final boss fight and the ending were both a little weak and didn't feel all that well thought out. Sadly, the earlier plot twist was far more interesting. It's also possible to lose interest mid-game before the big reveal due to some uneven pacing without much happening.+The idea of plasmids as unlockable special abilities was interesting and allowed a certain degree of character customization, although there could have been some teaking done here as certain abilties definitely seemed far more useful than others.- I would not recommend playing through the harder difficulties unless you are deadset on getting achivements...it's the type of game that adds ""challenge"" by upping enemy damage and by making them bullet sponges...rather than feel challenged you will feel cheated when you get one-shot after shooting a splicer in the head, from behind, and sometimes multiple times.OVERALL RATING:  I was pretty satisfied once I finished this game, although I wish the ending was a little less anti-climatic. Overall, I give it 8.0 out of 10.0 (B-)"
,Not Recommended,409710,25702516,"Posted: 25 September, 2016",all,Powdered Toastman,"So I was actually looking forward to writing a meaningless Steam review, where I would detail my feelings of playing this ""Remaster"" of one of the best FPS games of the last decade. While I noticed a few glaring visual glitches/oddities, as well as the lack of graphics options found in literally EVERY OTHER PC GAME on  the market, these issues were not hugely detracting from my enjoyment of this nostalgia-trip back to 2007.Unfortunately, all of my positive feelings and intentions of good-will went right out the window within the last 2 hours. [SPOILERS] I got to the first meeting with Sander Cohen, the crazed artist, and you have to get macabre pictures of bodies for his ""masterpiece"". I completed this, and then the game crashed when moving to the next area. Upon reloading the game, I noticed my progress was set back an hour, and I had to do it all again.This time, knowing exactly where to go, I sped through Cohen's chores and completed it in about 20 mins. But as Cohen himself comes down the stairs to reward you, the game spontaneously spawned a group of enemies (this did NOT happen the first time), and this caused Cohen to become hostile, and I was forced to kill him to progress, rather than leave him alive for achievements and additional items available down the line.Here, I tried to revert to my previous save, where I would have to do Cohen's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t mission AGAIN, but I noticed that auto-save was gone, and my last closest save was now 2 hours behind, rather than just 1 hour like the first time. So if I wanted to go back and play the game like I INTENDED TO, I'm forced to replay the SAME part a THIRD time, but now this will take literally 3 times as long. This was it. This is what broke my feelings about this poor excuse for a remaster.As is plainly obvious from all the other reviews, both in press and here with the Steam user reviews, this is not a ""true remaster"", but rather a middling port with a coat of paint on top to make it look noticeably different without altering any of the actual game itself. No bug fixes, very few graphics options, poor mouse support, and an awful, archaic save system.It's nice going back to Rapture after all this time. But this♥♥♥♥♥♥poor port job does this classic a huge disservice, and actually makes this a much more frustrating, less immersive experience."

When going for 100% achievements on the hardest difficulty, making sure you didn't miss any collectibles over and over again, carefully going through the same enemies several times was rather tedious, Any attempt to save more often was futile, as the crashes can happen even during saving.Those issues really distract from the real experience.

When it released in 2007, Bioshock was unqiue to the blockbuster market. Few titles were attempting to blend FPS and RPG together, fewer were experimenting with lofty political satire. Contrast this with today, where Bioshock clones are produced annually.  Irrational Games transformed a novel idea into a deserved mainstay of modern gaming. Anyone with interest in the medium should give Bioshock a try.However, I would avoid this ""remaster."" A contractor studio named Blind Squirrel Games did a poor job updating Bioshock for modern hardware. The biggest issue is that Bioshock Remastered lacks basic stability. Based on countless reports from the Steam forums (as well as personal experience), this version is prone to eating saves, breaking game logic, and simply crashing. It is not worth risking these headaches when every purchase of Bioshock Remastered comes bundled with a serviceable copy of the original.---My SpecsGPU - GTX 1070 (SLI Disabled)CPU - i7 6700kRAM - 16GBsStorage - NVMe SSDOS - Windows 10My Graphics SettingsResolution - 5120 x 2880 (Nvidia DSR)16x Anisotropic Filtering100 FOVDefault Mouse Cursor ScaleFullscreenVertical Sync - OFFAntialiasing - OFFDistortion - OFF (Enabling can cause crashing)Real-Time Reflections - ONWater Ripple - ONMaintain UI Aspect Ratio - OFFMy ExperienceBefore playing, I couldn't Reshade 3.0 to work. Injecting a sharpening filter caused Bioshock to immediately crash on launch. The stock antialiasing failed to cover a large portion of rendered objects, so I alternatively downsampled the resolution from 5K to forcibly eliminate jagged edges. It took 90 minutes to diagnose and repair a conflict involving the use of Nvidia DSR and a third party program on my PC. I would experience excruciating input lag unless I deliberately killed an essential app on my PC before every launch.Throughout playing Bioshock Remastered, I suffered crippling microstutter at various points. No modifications to the settings alleviated the problem, even if I lowered values in the .ini files themselves.

I understand that new releases need some time to iron out issues, but this game still has bugs from the original 2007 release present. How can something so trivial such as mouse acceleration and button mapping be so difficult to fix?The game visuals seem somewhat improved, if not mostly sharper textures and improved lighting, but the overall graphical issues detract from what makes this game special. There are at least a dozen instances in the first few levels were lighting strobes and textures still pop-in. Switching graphic settings would be nice, minus the fact that you are only given a single slider to adjust quality, whereas the original release had many different tweaks available.The sound in this appears to also have been either downgraded or heavily compressed. Using a pair of hi-fi headphones, I can hear quite a bit of static hiss in voice dialogue and sound effects. When the AI talks, it is hard to judge distance as it sounds like they are always nearby, directly in front of you. The original soundtrack is still there, so at least this version has that going for it.Menus and hacking are a complete mess. If you attempt to play with a keyboard and mouse, hacking becomes very difficult if you plan on using the mouse.. as there are quite a few issues with the mouse 'locking on' to items as well as horrible mouse acceleration issues.I really wanted to revisit Rapture, but this ""remaster"" has me going back to the original version of the game. This needs a LOT of work to fix all of the above issues as well as some game-breaking bugs being reported.

Being able to freeze the game to select your weapon is a nice perk but also destroys some of the immersion. The graphics themselves even remastered seem a bit dated and there are occasional texture and graphic glitches.

The crumbling dystopia feel is only enhanced by the gradual unfolding of the plot as you discover what happened to Rapture and why you are there. The final fight is straightforward and relatively easy to be honest. The game offers two different endings depending on if you saved or harvested the little sisters.

This is not a realistic expectation when us pc gamers got the slightly improved textures for free.  This remaster is meant for the console gamers who had to play the game at low resolution and framerates years ago, like I did.Having said all that, it is dissapointing that the original pc bugs are still present. This is not acceptable, and should have been fixed. You can find the bug list anywhere. These bugs are annoying but at least for me so far not game breaking.People are also complaining of the lack of adjustable graphics options.  While this is a bit strange, I think it's because you could run this game on a potatoe at this point, and still hit 60 frames. I'm using a 7950 and am getting 120 frames solid without ever dropping a frame, at 1080p.  The game is old people, it can only look so good.

I won't be talking too much about the game itself, however, as I am sure by now great many are aware of its status as an entertaining FPS and a marvellous story (which is of course subjective. At least most KNOW about the game). Instead I will be focusing on the remastering.Judging from the topmost reviews, many people are suffering from gamebreaking bugs, like saves deleting, crashing and sequence breaks. During my ~17 hours playthrough I encountered none of those, the game never crashed even though I frequently Alt+Tabbed to and fro. I did encounter some performance issues, even though very slight ones. The game would lag horribly on some parts of Apollo Square levels, especially the long corridors between areas. Small graphical issues were also somewhat frequent. Occasionally some effects, especially around Vita-Chambers, caused red-and-blue artifacts to appear. Sometimes dead bodies would start to slide towards one direction, banging against the wall until finally dissappearing. Textures would still sometimes pop-up, as I remember from the original version, where the high-def version of textures will only load when you are very close to an object. A big problem that many people seemed to be facing on the original version, sounds not working from the get go and requiring some fiddling with output settings, was this time NOT present, so at least some technical improvements have been made.Minor annoyances, such as the semi-unskippable intro splashes when you start up the game, are still there.  The ""quicksave"" loading screen is too long to be called a ""quicksave"" which kind of defeats the purpose. Complaints about difficulty are always a matter of taste, but as an avid gamer I felt normal too easy towards the end, especially final boss was too much of a stroll. Conversely some early game enemies, especially Houdini Splicers, felt sometimes even annoyingly powerful. Same goes for the hacking minigame. While I enjoy the concept, the difficulty seems somewhat bipolar. Usually they are too easy, unless you encounter a very hard one that requires pure luck to be solved in time. People new to video games might have different experiences though and I haven't tried harder difficulties (although I have bad experiences - bullet spongy enemies - on that, particularly in Bioshock Infinite).The game looked quite nice, although not suberb. Weren't it for the bonus features, namely the Making of documentary and some challenge levels, it would not be enough bang for your buck at full price. Owners of the original version received to product for free. I didn't care about the challenge levels so I haven't tried them, but the documentary is extremely interesting! I've always appreciated features like this included in video games and it was one of the biggest reasons I replayed the game. Huge bonus for that one. Ken Levine mentioned on one episode how he got the inspiration for the story from Ayn Rand's book ""Fountainhead"", although I wonder if he really meant ""Atlas Shrugged"". At least its plot and setting resemble the game more than Fountainhead. But I digress.If you didn't like Bioshock before, you won't like it after this product either. Nothing in the core gameplay has changed. If you can manage a playthrough without debilitating performance issues, Bioshock 1 Remastered will be a fine experience for people returning to Rapture!"

So here's a tip 2K: Don't call something a remaster when it's this broken on release. Spend a few more weeks tweaking it so PC users can have the same quality of experience as console users, and have them be able to configure the game to their preferences. If you had done that all these negative reviews wouldn't have been hereSO before you start playing:-Google 'Bioshock Remastered fix'-Find the sections about Mouse options, otherwise it's near unplayable.-And if you like you can change the FOV and graphics for a better experience.WATCH OUT. If the game crashes, which might happen sometimes, you lose all your preferences. Make sure to put the .ini files on ""READ ONLY"" after you've done the fan-fixes to largely prevent this problem.So the remaster is basically a better looking version of the original game. It doesn't make any changes to the combat or interface which some find annoying. Like being unable to use plasmids and guns at the same time, but I believe that would remove some of the challenge. And I personally had no trouble playing the old game as it's supposed to be played. All in all it's still Bioshock. Spend 20-30 minutes to make the game play smoothly for you, then dive into the underwater story of Rapture once again.Oh and you get some challenges, achevements and a nifty museum to look at old models and other artwork from development which I found pretty neat.."

Now, after having the game crash a second time and losing more significant progress, I have to say that they really dropped the ball. It almost like they hyped everyone up, updated the textures, then sat on it without working to test and fix problems. Gameplay bugs are annoying, but if the game would stop crashing and killing my progress, it would be tolerable, as having to save every 5 minutes to assure progress is being made dampens the experience.Update: 4th crash of playthrough, had to shut down PC each time to get out of game. It actually gets worse as the game goes on. Its pretty ridiculous for a single player game thats around 10 hours to have this many problems.Update: Completed the game at 11 hours. 8 total crashes, all but 2 required a complete restart of my pc to get out of.

76561198079350603,Not Recommended,409710,25560057,"Posted: 17 September, 2016",all,[HG] Snowyamur,"BioShock™ Remastered is the re-make of the sci-fi, FPS, action, and lore-heavy video game, Bioshock, created and published by 2K Games (2K Boston and 2K Australia) with higher-end graphics ranging up to 4k Resolution, improved detail and environmental effects, and more. Like the original nine-year old Bioshock, you play as Jack, a passenger on a plane that crashes in the Mid-Atlantic Ocean adjacent to a mysterious tower. Throughout most of the game, you will be placed in Rapture, a dystopian, underwater city where you must traverse its unholy labyrinth of mayhem as you fight off countless genetically-mutated freaks and take on the tyrants that ruled before its fall on the Eve of 1969. Using a large array of weapons and godly powers provided by plasmids, refined substances that modify one’s DNA and genetic blueprint, you will take on the ruined inhabitants of the once great “paradise” and either be the savior of mankind… or its downfall.Okay, so I when I heard about the Bioshock Remastered Collection that was to be released on September 15, 3:00 PM PST, I had severe hype. In-fact, this hype was so severe, that I watched videos of Bioshock gameplay to ensure I was ready for what was coming. Aside from this, I played this game multiple times, so I was more interested in this particular game over the other two for the severe nostalgia. In my eyes, I found this game quite a treat to play because of the history, creativity, and imagination implemented into the game’s foundation, with all the splicers, the Big Daddies, and the plasmids (what fun!). Despite this, when I received BioShock™ Remastered for free from 2K games two days ago and played it for about 4 hours the time this review was written…. I was not impressed at all.First off, I’m not saying that I’m disappointed this game was free, since I played Bioshock the time it was out, had it on my computer for a while (first I played it was on console, though), and yeah, it was a free video game gift from 2K. Who would not like free stuff? Of course, the one thing about free is that the person providing the product could make it as crappy as they wish, and if something was wrong with it, people could complain, but it would not be strong enough to counter that this was a “free” game,UNLESSsomeone bought it, in which case, stronger debates ensue.To start off, why am I disappointed in this game? For starters, even though the title of the product says “BioShock™ Remastered,” it feels more like a “BioShock™ Retextured” because the only thing that seemed to show improvement was the graphics: the bathyspheres, the actual ocean, the splicer models, etc. Graphics are great, but this is still a video game, and you cannot say it is “Remastered” if a s**t ton of bugs still remain from the original; that is false advertisement. Despite this, the worst part of all is that there are more bugs than the original. While I would like to create an elaborate list of the new and old bugs in this game, I do not want to because it would take up space in this review. So, I will simply rate this game in terms of the bugs, gameplay, and mechanics/settings.So, from playing this game for a few hours, I have no idea how the hell there are more bugs from the original. There are bugs involving the Game Difficulty changing every time it loads up (I now encountered this problem), making it impossible to receive achievements regarding difficulty, there is a bug where in Neptune’s Bounty, when you pick up a pistolafterfinishing off Peach Wilkins, your Wrench switches to Number Key 2, and you cannot fix that (not a huge deal, really, simply annoying), and worse of all, there are bugs where enemies on fire willNOTrun to the water when set on fire like they used to, and when looking at them, your framerate drops heavily. Of course, when they do go into the water, your GPU will vomit and you will begin to see colors (blue and dark-red) for the rest of the game when you look at stationary water (NOTwaterfalls or water under gravity effects). BioShock™ Remastered might as well be called “BioShock™ Re-bugged” because of how many errors there are.With the gameplay, seems the same as the first. There is now a new difficulty level called Survivor, which is even harder than Hard difficulty and makes every enemy almost capable of insta-killing you, hacking a lot harder with busters and sirensevery single hackon a Vending Machine or Health Station, and Bouncers will literally meltALL YOUR HEALTHthe second it charges into you, and even though you are at full health and there is that second-wind mechanic, he will still kill you. To me, I do not find Survivor mode a horrible implementation into the game (except for insta-killing), for it now makes the player actually think about what to shoot and use instead of running at everyone with a Wrench and killing them, as well as forces them into a position where they really have to try to dodge the Big Daddy instead of standing out in the open shooting with Electric Buck. Although these seem positive, now it is time for the bad news. Field-of-view (FOV) has been changed, or moved back a bit from the player camera, making melee combat a pain to accomplish with the Wrench because all the enemies seem harder to hit now. Due to plasmid cosmetic effects’ upgrade, every time you use a plasmid, like Electro Bolt or Incinerate!, you have the chance of your screen freezing for a moment, and in-game, you have passed about ten seconds where you usually were (time-warp, but what the f**k?) Worst of all, mouse acceleration is off the f**king roof, for even when you adjust the sensitivity, it still runs as if you set the setting to maximum, and the mouse acceleration with a simple wrist-jerk makes the player wildly move the camera in a random direction.Regarding the mechanics/settings,  the game might crash, sending you all the way back to where you were when youlast saved…, such fun when there is no auto-save feature every few minutes in a damn Remastered version of Bioshock. In addition to that, as mentioned earlier, the settings have a tendency to reset for some reason, which is a bug and constant annoyance; I have never seen that happen in the original game. When you start up the game every time, you cannot skip the intro like the original, making it irritating to have to see the cutscenes in this order: 2K Games, old music player showing 2K Australia, 2K Boston, and that other company I don’t know about because you can skip around that time. Furthermore, as stated earlier, there is no way to change where your weapons go in what slots; I’m not sure if that was in the original Bioshock, but for the Remastered, I expected it here, where it remains missing. In the end, I cannot say how bad the settings are when they do not take effect and resetevery single timeI restart up my game.The once-proud title, still proud, and continuing on with this Remastered version, the new Bioshock title deserves a:🐅Snowy's Scorey🐅:10: Masterpiece, highly recommended to play9: Truly brilliant, recommended at its best8: Okay, will recommend7: Decent, will recommend, but within certain limitations6: Average, probably not worth recommending, but at least looking at5: Meh, some things are right, some wrong, but not complete4.

I gave the original a 10/10, and this one deserves a 6/10 for new bugs, settings that hate people, and the mechanics of the game with the FOV and ridiculous mouse acceleration."

I did notice that this game assumed I was using a gamepad (quick option to have all queues be based on M+K) and it assumed I was running waay above 1900x1080 so a quick notch down fixed that which may account for some of the mouse issues (or maybe not).This game is amazing and I'm enjoying the graphics upgrade (most notably with lighting and water)"

They even added Achievements which I feel is fantastic as long time lovers of the series can 100% it to show off their support.However no bugs have been fixed, the game still has forced mouse acceleration and smoothing, terrible FOV with a single one click solution, all in all the video options (I use the word options lightly) has 4 different settings you can tweak.Rapture is well worth visiting again, and I would love nothing more to support this game, give it my recommendation, I payed the $20 dollars for it just so I could support it and revisit a classic! but to see not one single bug has been fixed is pretty terrible, and now we have the added problem of new bugs, some white knights are saying, give them a chance to fix them… I say if it's been 9 years and they still cannot be bothered patching bugs the community has been begging to be addressed.For those who need to buy the game, I wouldn’t bother as you will experience the same problems that you may of faced all those years ago plus new bugs (New bugs are understandable).

Some years later they bring out the Remastered Version and completely ignored this fact.

This results in continually opening and closing the game to try and determine if problems have been fixed.Further complicating this is the fact that the opening logos, which are a good 30 seconds - 1 minute, are not skippable at all.AND, any graphics changes that you make in the in-game menu, in addition to any other changes in the options menus, get reset every single time you close and re-open the game.Desperately hoping for a fix but, since the original is still buggy 10 years later, not holding my breath for it."

,Recommended,409710,35172166,Posted: 23 September,all,OPness,"""A man chooses; a slave obeys."" - Andrew RyanI'm writing this review to pass the time while it instals based on what I remember because boy howdy did this game leave an impression. I will update if I encounter any game breaking glitches with the HD version.Before starting, I will say, if you dislike scary games, me too! This game is a bit spoopy at times, but the jumpscares are minimal. Its really the dimented nature of the setting that leads to a feeling of creepiness and uneasiness. I'd say on a scary level of Finding Nemo to Saw, this game gets a round an Aliens, so lets begin.I played this game a lot in my teens when it first came out and I'm excited to play it again in HD. Playing with vita chambers turned off is almost a must, because the vita chambers make the game laughable. However, having them turned off, and the difficulty set to max, was one of my absolute favorite game play experiences as a kid, because you had to prepare for each encounter in a way you were going to survive. As such, it forces you to utilize all the tools at your disposal in creative ways to succeed, something few games ever actually accomplish. Usually in a game, you find the gun or the weapon you like best and you just go do your thing. If you do that on hard with vita chambers turned off, you're favorite weapon will be out of ammo, and you are going to die.If you don't know anything at all about this game, the game play involves ultilizing guns that you upgrade by exploring, and a mechanic called plasmids, which is basically magic fueled by stem cells (Adam) harvest orginally from deep sea slugs! Now, though, its not found in deep sea slugs... and how you wan't to go about getting your Adam is a major part of the story telling.There's also a hacking mechanic, that lamentably, is the weakest part of the game, as the whole get the juice to the right place with the tubes gets old after a while, but darned it if it isn't really satisfying watching an enemy retreat to a healing station only to die because you hacked it to spew poison in their face.Without spoiling anything, this is one of the few games I've played that to me, is art. The world is thematic and well crafted, and the story Bioshock 1 has to tell not only makes a statement about gaming, but the nature of choice and morality as a conscious being. This game succeeded years ago in melding visual story telling with propoganda, ads, audio books, people talking to you via walky talkie,and cut scenes to deliver of a theme that many games fail to even come close to delivering in terms of quality today.I would say a similar game that came out recently in terms of a story worth thinking about was SOMA, humorously also set under water, however that game suffered from rather limited gameplay that this game does not. So assuming this game runes smoothy, and you haven't had it spoiled for you, holy balls is it one of the more meaningful storys you can engage in for a $20 price tag.Edits from the future!: AIght so I've had it crash once, but that was because I was trying to do too much at once with other applications, and I think it caused it to crash again later, but my biggest issue is I couldn't get it to stream in a way were the game is audible. I was either talking while a played the game in silence, or going deaf for my viewers. I messed with all the audio sliders and ultimately the solution was a combination of turning up my mic volume in Razer Synaps, while turning down the volume my mic was recording at with GeForce. I also changed the game itself from stereo to surround and turned it all the way to 10, which seemed to help too.Not the best as I will have to change it later for other games... but also not even a problem you don't plan to stream."

You can do some fixes to make it somewhat playable, but even with those fixes the mouse still feels terrible with acceleration and sensitivity changing while playing.Not recommended without proper fixes in the form of patches that actually fix the issues.

The only real improvement that has been made is the flow of gameplay, which feels much more smooth and less clunky than it's predecessor. The worst of all, however, is the options menu. Dear lord, it's so sparce it can't even be called a menu. It is literally 4 options (antialiasing, V-Sync, anisotropic filtering, and one other that's slipping my mind right now) with a Yes/No configuration, and a resolution silder. That's just insulting.

Anisotropic filtering is the ONLY option in the video settings that has to do with the detail of the visuals. There isn't even a quality selection. The horrible mouse smoothing is STILL HERE from the original Bioshock release. Finally there is only an expanded fov option and not an fov slider!

76561198153176634,Recommended,409710,30935768,Posted: 3 April,all,[YGS]Dies On Duty,"From my past experience with Bioshock from the ps3 i didnt much care for the game. Since i saw it was on sale with all the dlc thanks to the HD collection i thought of giving it another try. To see if my opinons of the game has changed. I will be looking at the game in a pro/ con style and ending the review with my final conculsion.Pro:The game looks amazing. The graphics certainly look better than what i experienced back on the ps3. As for how does it compare to the Bioshock original game on steam...i dont know. I probably wont ever touch it since it is the same game and i have no need to play the original copy.The story is great. I was getting really into the narrative of the story.The atmospher was spot on. I will admit i did get spooked a little at points since it was a horror game but on the surface it isnt that scary. When you get sucked into the game then you get a little fright at some moments that were just odd and creepy....The flickering lights didnt help ease that tension.Gameplay or better gun play was good. The guns felt like they did work. Though at times i do wish a headshot ment a headshot on enemies even if they had one of those plastic masks. A bullet should still be able to fly through plastic and in the the head. There was a nice variety of guns to use like a handgun, tompson, shotgun, .ect. Not to mention a few plasmids to spice up combat by setting your enemies on fire or shocking them in water.Equipable items adds more depth to the gameplay. Besides combat the player can equip tonics to boost their defence, wrench damage, research bonus exp, or damage done to machines. One can mix and match tonics to fit their play style.Music was ok. Cant say much about it since the game does not have much music...its a horror game, the lack of calming music or music at all helps build tension and fear.The game has additional content which is very cool to look at. The first that i will be mentioning is that there is a museum of content that was scraped during development. So you can go and look at the enemy models that could have been in the game or the concept art of what the big daddy could of been. The big daddy art is really sick looking and definantly worth looking at. The other additional content was a video documentary of behind the scenes of the making of bioshock or commentaries by the developers of the game. I didnt really look at it but for those who do or just interested in these things you find these video documentaries scattered in the game. Just collect them and watch them now or later in the main menu. Finally there is dlc...i will talk about it real soon.Con:The dlc was short and just challenges. 3 challenges. They are not very fun to do and quite short. One mission is to fight all enemies in an arena style mission, another is using witts to turn the farris wheel to free the litter sister but you must use electricity to power up the switch and there are limited electrical equipment. I dont mind the using your witts to complete a challenge but its just boring and doesnt capture the strenght of the game.Frame rate issues. Initially i had some really bad frame rate issues. My frames were at like 10fps. Then  i set the game to run a different GPU and it work well. I know many people have frame rate issues and that does really suck. Even when my frame rate is at like 60fps i did on rare moments where the game froze for like a second then continued. It was odd and kind of ruined the emersion sometimes but for the most part i overlooked it since the game was running at 60fps than 10fps.Conclusion:Bioshock HD or Bioshock Remasted is a great game for new commers to experience the bioshock world and gameplay but for a fan that played the game before you may not want to buy another copy of bioshock that is said to have better graphics. It would be a nice walk down memory lane though. For me it was an experience since after my first playthrough of bioshock on the ps3 i hated that game and pretty much the entires series other than infinite. I will review that game another time. Going through the game again it was having a blast, i got a few laughs at some crazy rag doll moments or felt engaged with the story to continue to the end. I did know the story when going into this game but it did feel like the first time playing it and enjoyed every minute of it leading to earing all the achievements. Well i didnt enjoy the dlc but that is already known."

I suppose like everyone else, this review is meant to tell you whether it's worth getting the remaster or not. Well, honestly, no. I mean, unless you got it for free because you already have it, in which case, you already know what it's like. Haven't had any crashes yet or any problems that didn't already exist in the original, and maybe that's what I can't recommend it. It hasn't had any of the bugs fixed as other reviews point out.However, the mouse sensitivity/acceleration I feel is overexaggerated. Yes, it's still present and it can be annoying, but I managed to complete the original very well without much trouble. In fact, unlike the original, this one doesn't suffer from the 30 FPS animations and physics and the sound works unlike the old one which required turning on ""Stereo Mix"". I speak only for myself though. The improvement in graphics isn't really much. Not that I have noticed. I expected at the minimum for the character models to look better but unfortunately, that isn't the case.Perhaps the textures are merely better and higher resolution and the lighting is new. But that's hardly a compliment when everything else is the same, including the bugs. So, as much as I would like to recommend it, I feel like it's not really worth it. If anyone has their old one working as they would like, they'd be better off playing that. Don't bother struggling with the bugs, especially if you can't even load the game because you get one of those crashes or it keeps crashing in-game for you."

Because when I played this I couldn't even tell they did anything. The changes were so small and insignificant that I would only even notice them if I stopped and looked carefully. The point of remastering a game is to make it look like it was made today. To not just change the graphics, but to change everything else to be more advanced and perfect. To do today what technology couldn't allow back then.Look at Halo 2: Anniversary. That was a remastering done right. Because not only did they beautifully remake all the textures, they also included a brand new effects engine to enhance the lighting and shading. The visuals were so well done that it looked almost real. They even added in some new easter eggs here and there to reference what had been added to the franchise since the original Halo 2. Then of course they rerecorded most of the sound effects and redid the score. And who could forget addition of CGI cutscenes made with motion capture. Those cutscenes, man. They looked better than real life. Truly, Halo 2: Anniversary is a prime example of what all remasters should strive to be like.BioShock's remastering, however, was sloppily put together with little to no effort as a quick money grab. All they did was slightly touch up the graphics. But did they fix any of the bugs that were already present in the game? Did they adjust the models to look smoother and less blocky? Did they record any new sounds? Did they add any new easter eggs to reference the events of Burial At Sea? No. Of course they didn't. Why would they? This is 2K we're talking about. They don't care about their fans. They don't care about being perfect. They only care about money. And they used BioShock because of its sudden rise in popularity thanks to BioShock Infinite. It's a shame to see such a great trilogy fall into the hands of a greedy corporation who doesn't care about it as much as its original creators. Such is the way of franchises these days. May BioShock rest in peace."

Not only the fact I need two seperate mouse profiles I then need to keep the in game sensitivity at 2 or above.When I first attempted to play the series the graphics were a bit dated but very good longevity compared to other titles in the same year; the only problem is that the graphics look worse! Yes the 1080p menu issue and scaling is improved but the mouse input lag is still bad but the textures and shading is worse in some places!I have not looked too much into the performance but since the graphical settings are so lacking anyways it does not even matter, I push above 144hz at times but at seemingly empty moments it drops to 90 (this would be more important if my monitor was not 60hz).Screen tearing is actually pretty awful and vysnc is vsync so if you do turn it on expect ""prominent"" input lag compared to the ""noticable"" without vsync.Audio is awful and really sounds compressed and static at times; it seems as if they have not touched the auido one bit.Overall my first impression are no better than playing the original release in 2007 a few months ago, only thing improved is the menu and ingame menu resolution (but somehow the mouse still feels very yucky when in these menus and ingame it is even worse).

Where Deus Ex showed the light at the end of the tunnel, Bioshock had the difficult task to carry the industry through it during the times of uncertainty.The original game was a hit not just in terms of gameplay, but through the artistic direction, setting and the narrative as well. The game had squeezed every inch of magic out of the now-dated Unreal Engine 2 to craft a fascinating art deco world lost underneath the sea of time. Bottom line is the original is one of the classics of gaming.So with the remastered edition I wanted to see what has changed. Well, not much really. The game looks largely the same as before, but little tweaks were gone here and there to make it a little bit more visually pleasing. Unfortunately, that is where the improvements end. The game still brings a lot of the old technical issues back there is literally no excuse for not fixing it. Like for example mouse acceleration is still a big issue, making keyboard and mouse controls completely use less. The game does not have any graphical options, which is fine in the sense with my GTX 970, I can go 100 fps on average at 4K, still customization is one of the pillars of PC Gaming. Finally odd issues like how the game feels like it froze for a second when trying to bring up the map.Finally, the is hardly a remaster. Tweaks to lighting aren’t remaster. A true remaster would have been something like porting the game to unreal engine 4 with all the enhancements it brings with higher resolution textures. If you have played the original a few months ago, you won’t feel any different playing this. But I guess it is free for people who own it, still, it is a shame as the game would have looked and played even more brilliantly if it was an actual remaster.So there you have it. If you have the original already, you will get this version for free so you can check it out yourself. If by chance you played the original but not liable to receive the updated version, then, don’t bother. This version is the same as the original. Hopefully one day we will get a true remaster of this great game, until then, just wait."

Here, I'll be focusing on the aspects of the remastered edition only. As for BioShock: I consider it one of the best games I have every played. This and its sequels are on par with Valve's Half Life series and I pick them up from time to time to do an additional walkthrough.Pros:+++ enchanced graphics: crispier textures and slightly better effects; although the game is still dated (due to its ""old"" engine) it's nice to replay a game with these graphical upgrades+++ an extra ""museum"" gameplay mode to look around and find old character models; something similar that can be found in BioShock Infinite+++ an added challenge mode that I have yet to play; seems to be similar to that of B Infinite+++ developer commentary: I love it! the movie reels are scattered throughout the levels (one for each stage); look into every corner otherwise you won't find them+++ achievements: finally! I missed them in the original (even though the console versions all had them)+++ this update comes as a free update to those already having the game; compared to other remastered edition releases (Dead Island, Hard Reset) this is awfully nice from the creatorsCons:--- crashes, crashes and crashes everywhere; the game can crash if you open a door or if you pick up a new plasmid.--- the crashes, unfortunately, result in all your settings' resetting; this is pretty annoying--- the most annoying crash was when I did a quicksave which made me lose all my saves (except for the last autosave the game made)--- this is a minor, albeit annoying problem: if there were issues such as the mouse acceleration problem in the original game then why do we have some of them present in the new game? These exact same problems pop up only to be addressed once moreConclusion:At this point, I do not recommend the remastered edition. It causes more issues than I'd expected. It's a shame such an updated game is released nowadays. Make no mistake: I appreciate the updates and the fact that this is all free for existing customers.Since 2K announced there will be fixes and the issues posted by the players will be addressed I'll update my review later, but as of this point (10 days after the release) this is a mess of bugs that can easily eliminate the joy you felt whilst playing the story in Rapture."

Framerate is constant at 60 fps. Many of the newer reviews report that it runs well now, so you may want to try again if you had performance issues in the past.UPDATE 5/11/17Ok, so I just finished the game, and now I can see how it has the tendancy to crash. It never randony crashed while in game, but it did crash during a load and once during a save. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥ part is, as you probably have read, the last couple of save files are deleted when that happens. I lost about 10 mins progress the first crash, and about 30 mins the second. Other than that, it ran well.Do I still recommend this game? Yes. It's a beautiful remaster of one of the best games ever made. I think the stability has improved since it was released, although it's still not perfect. All I can say is, save often, in new slots. And when you run out of save slots, delete some old ones and continue to save in new ones all the time. When I lost 30 mins progress was when I tried to save and overwrite the last slot, which caused a crash. Do yourself a favor, have a good save practice, and you should have a great time."

I'm on the latest nvidia drivers, so not sure what's up there. It's not game breaking, but it is distracting.Audio's messed up too. NPC voices I should be able to hear fine with a 5.1 speaker setup is coming out super quiet, so I had to enable subtitles.And, of course, it's bioshock, with its awful hollow feeling combat, clunky movement controls, splashy weapon aim, etc."

I normally don't like to replay games, but when I heard this was coming out I decided to play the remastered version.When it was first announced, I thought ""The graphics will be better than Infinite, since they had a long time for this remastered, they could also use textures from the Infinite DLC."" Boy was I wrong! It literally looks almost exactly the same as the original at 4k, except a LITTLE less blocky. I compared the 4k of the original and this one... seriously no difference. You know maybe my expections were too high, but you would think it would at least look moderately better, but come on people are going to spend 20 bucks for the same game that you can go online and get the triple pack with the original AND the 2 sequels for $17!!! I mean come on, you could control the graphics more in the original than this one.Ok, graphics are not everything, many can argue that older games are way better than modern day games (which I agree), so lets take graphics out of the equation. Now lets look at it from a coding side. Now a remaster usually fixes bugs and adds necessary componets that the original should have... wait, what's this, there is no difference? The answer is yes, the bugs from the original are still there!! It's like the developers literally COPIED AND PASTED THE CODING. Same mouse problems are still there for example. Now that is absolutly horrible.Alright maybe they didn't mess up one of the easiest things like audio right, RIGHT? NO, it sounds EXACTLY like the original, not even close to Infinite's quality. I mean, you would think they would fix some of the staticly like sound that the original had, but no they did not.In the end, Bioshock by itself is absolutly an amazing game, but they really messed up this remaster. I HIGHLY reccomend playing the game, but just get the cheaper triple pack online since they are all exactly the same as the remastered versions. This was complete laziness, and I hope I do not see this kind of laziness out of this comapny again.P.S. I understand I got this for free because of the special PC offer, but still this is not acceptable."

,Recommended,409710,29318991,Posted: 17 January,all,l'Original,"This reviewer received this edition for free by owning the original BioShock on Steam.When originally released, this edition felt, played, and crashed like a shoddy console port, because to be honest that is what it was then.  After a bit of attention (still should have more!), this edition has become something else, and Recommendable over the original.Therefore I will review the Remastered edition in its current form in comparison to the state it was in when first released.Pros of this edition:The classic political satire FPS is back, looking much, much better than before.Some more graphics options seem to be in there now, and work better.Holy ♥♥♥♥ is Rapture beautiful now.Negatives:After the Dec patch, then going back into the game on a fresh install, there seems to be few of the original Remastered edition's problems of random save crashing, but there are some things that should be noted.Some still report some issues with crashing around saves - this may be the engine taking a barf due to resource bottleneck somewhere.  IIRC the original engine had something of this problem regarding VRAM, so that is my suggestion for any likely culprit to start looking at if you experience these problems.For best stability and experience, the Recommended specs are now quite spot-on and should be regarded as Minimum.The system RAM required should be around 8GB for best smoothness and lack of crashing/save corruption.VRAM should probably be around 2GB for the same.Quad-Core CPU 2,5GHz or higher, though I've had it run fairly well before on the 2.2GHz QC toaster.Still, Save Now, Save Often, Save Five Minutes Ago may apply given your experience, but there has been enough attention to make this worth a more worthwhile try.  Use multiple save slots.This edition may still require OS update packages to overcome crashes on startup, but after that it appears to be fairly stable now.This may seem like a lot of Negatives compared to the positive, but mostly serves as awareness for a better experience than what was offered before.Thank you, 2K Games, for doing well on addressing the concerns of your community, and would you kindly continue giving more attention towards the technical troubles that do remain?  Treating classics right is a great thing to see from publishers/developers.This is now the edition of BioShock I would recommend for anyone to consider as introduction to the series."

Texture is bugging up, walls turning invisible etc. When I try to record (using Fraps), it's kinda fixed. Texture stays where it should be, but the game slows down and FPS is locked to 30. I have no clue what's going on at the devs, but this didn't help, that's for sure!Such a lovely game, such a lovely first 5 minutes of gameplay! Then the game decides to crash, and progress and changed settings were gone...I was so eager to do a new lets play of this game, in it's new remastered form, and on hard without Vita-chambers. But these problems would turn that effort into a nightmare. I managed to get to the part where it loads before you get out of the bathysphere for the first time, and I was stuck. I sat there for 10-15 mins before I decided to manually shut down the game. That led to a new problem; not being able to exit it at all without creating a new desktop (this is on Windows 10 btw) or shutting down the PC. I tried once again. My settings where reset, so I had to change them again before I started. Skipped as quickly as I could through the parts I already recorded gameplay and cam for, and saved, just in case. This time I got past the loading screen! Yay!So I continued where I left on previous recording attempt. It went perfectly, until I stood in front of the first Gatherer's Garden, where you get your first plasmid. I wanted to save, just in case. Then the game crashed. ""ARE YOU F'ING KIDDING ME?!"" I screamed. Took a deep breath, and restarted my PC AND game, maybe my PC needed a reboot after that first problem. To my huge disappointment (but no surprise), the settings where reset, but my saves was there though!But no need for that save when the settings are RESET, is it??! Because that save was now on NORMAL and not HARD anymore for some reason!I really hope there will be a fix for this. My PC has decent specs, and should handle this game with no problems!"

Bioshock games are of the sort that when you sit down to play, you dont get back up until its over. The story is so gripping that you are totally immersed in the world during the ten or so hours that you are in it. This spirit is destroyed by the intermittent crashes that will inevitably come throughout your playthrough. I had heard of this problem and decided I would hold off on until the remaster came out. The fact that this wasnt fixed is an absolute disgrace.With about an hour to go my game crashed for maybe the fourth or fifth time in the playthrough and I went back to find that the past hour of play was lost. This was right at the climax of the story and was a total immersion breaker for me. I was furious. So much so that I uninstalled it and watched the ending online. Whilst there are some fantastic moments, (dont get me wrong, they are FANTASTIC moments), this petty issue will stick out more in my memory.

There are so many things wrong with this ""remastered"" game, I'm not even going to try playing it again unless it's fixed. I thought this would fix the compatibility issues I had with the Original version on some of my other computers but I was wrong, I'm better off getting all of my broken computers with older versions of Windows fixed than trying to play this crap on devices with Windows 10. Not only does it mess everything up, it freezes up and stops running every 15-30 minutes. I lost a lot of Game Saves as well, so when I restarted the game, my progress was gone and I had to start 1 hour behind where I was before. I tried saving whenever I thought about saving but the game wouldn't save until a certain amount of time passed, unlike the Original game. When trying to turn or walk or do pretty much anything in this version, it's so choppy that my character dies before I can turn around to see who's there, when hacking machines, bots, etc., the tiles don't turn over until it's too late, and a lot of other things that work in the Original version don't work as well in this version.The new patch received on Oct. 6 helped clear up a lot of the mouse and gameplay issues. It runs smoother and doesn't freeze up or stop running anymore. The patch changed the game from full screen to windowed and to save your game before exiting, the game dosn't ask if you'd like to save it before you exit, so make sure to save it before clicking exit.I'll give the game another try before changing my review from ""not recommended "" to ""recommended"".I can't change this to a ""recommended"" positive review. I installed it onto my new computer that has better hardware and Windows 10 OS but it's still pretty bad. It keeps crashing, some of my saved games that were done when the game wasn't crashing are missing and I lost hours of ptogress, and sometimes when I'm tryiing to pick items up or from corpses, ""E"" isn't doing what it should.

Well, in this HD remaster I can definitely change the difficulty, BUT it automatically resets back to ""medium"" if I exit the game and come back later on to continue the game.  I purchased the original version of this game, I set the difficulty as I saw fit, I shouldn't be forced to manually set it back to where I originally put it because the game doesn't want to honor the difficulty settings I the customer chose to play it on.Finally, the ""Remaster"" isn't really all that different in appearance from the original game which came out in 2007.  As the folks at Rock, Paper, Shotgun put it, this looks like a crappy port from a PS4.  Well, I'm not using a PS4, I'm using a PC, and I expect the product to reflect that.

I HAVE THE AUTHORITY NOW TO REVIEW THIS GAME.Short review :Oh boy, I should have stopped when I hit 2 hours mark.... I feel really dumb to have played this game.Long review :I remembered Bioshock to be a GREAT game and a great experience to be had, even though I played it on an old laptop (my old laptop was bought sometime around Oct 2010, specs I think was an Intel i5 and GPU was Radeon 5450M), I first played the Original Bioshock sometime in 2012.I have vacuumed from playing any pc games for almost 2 years because of work and family commitment.Just recently, I got myself a new laptop (specs are Intel i7 6700HQ and NVidia GTX 960M) and was pleasantly surprised that I got a FREE Bioshock Remastered edition. Therefore technically, I got this game for free.Since this game got loads of achivements + I remembered it to be a great experience, I played this game for the 2nd time.Oh boy, I should have stopped when I hit 2 hours mark.... The game, even with the patch, is ruined by bugs and glitches.Here are the glitch I got :- Flickering textures --> Game takes a while to resolve textures to better textures-Game becoming very dark (low gamma) after loading --> This is not good in getting those hard achievements since sometimes you will be saving in the middle of the fight- Game crashes after loading or saving --> Oh boy...- Saved games GONE abruptly --> Many times I had to replay certain areas/section- Game options changed after crashing --> Had to redo optionsThe DLC do not add anything to the story. It serves as an alternative way to play the game as an action puzzler game rather than a straight action game. Therefore I rate the DLC as an okay DLC. The DLC is crippled with the same bugs as well.I feel dumb to have played this game for achivements. I have achieved nothing but wasted time and bad experience.In conclusion, wait until the game is fixed properly for the player to have a better experience. Otherwise, do not waste your time."

From right out of the gate, I experienced glitches and crashes. The opening cutscene would cut to white at the end then return me to the main menu.Following working around that, I waa able to play fine up until my saved data was deleted multiple times, forcing me into beginning from the start. That eventually turned into drowning after the opening cutscene continally.At that point, I went back and installed the original Bioshock. From my experience with the two, the original is superior in every aspect. Smoother game play, less bugging out and crashing, and overall better graphics, at least for me on count of integrated Intel graphics.The only way I can reccomend the remastered version in its current state is if it has the original with it.I'll be glad to revisit this review and give it a thumbs up once Bioshock Remastered stops glitching out and crashing.

Transcendental.I never expected to play another FPS as good as ""Half-Life 2"". HL2, like it or not, is one of the gold standards by which games are measured (shooters in particular). I thought if I were lucky, I might happen in to another two or three games that could hope to approach the hallowed shrine that is HL2. Not beat it, of course. But if I could play something else that came close... well, that would be great. Something innovative, engaging, grossly absorbing. Something that was simultaneously interactive and cinematic. Something that would punish, but bring me back for more on all fronts: great graphics, interesting gameplay and a compelling story. ""Bioshock"" delivers.It seems appropriate to confirm something mentioned in other reviews: the crashes. Yes, they happen. On occasion, I was ejected from the game and dumped back to the desktop. When that happened, I was always able to load back in from my previous save and continue play. Those instances were infrequent: during my play-through, the client crashed a handful of times. With one exception, the crashes seemed to occur shortly after loading or saving. First one happened about ten hours in. It's more irritant than anything else, but still comes as a surprise when a product so seasoned and polished could still be plagued by random crashes.The remastered version sacrifices none of the gameplay or style that made it such a signature experience. While not as breathtaking as some titles released more recently, this is still a gorgeous game that has the added benefit of running on an older or less powerful rig. This version also includes three 'challenge rooms' that each offer a unique, stand-alone scenario. The events in those challenges are not connected to the main story: they are strictly tests of the players knowledge and ability.10/10, two thumbs up; I cannot recommend this game highly enough. Would you kindly play this game? It's a classic in every sense of the word. Not just as an FPS, not even as a game, but for storytelling in any medium. Finally, HL2 has something to keep it company in that lonely bracket at the top tier of entertainment. Very much looking forward to the next installment in the franchise.Tangential thought: HL2 = 1984; Bioshock = A Clockwork Orange?edit: overuse of 'front', re-worded for overall clarity"

Some effects are missing and the sound quality has been drastically reduced due to compression for whatever reason.As for the game itself, it’s just as clunky as it was in 2009. Combat sucks, period. Plus, I had to edit .ini files to turn the crouch, walk and ADS from a toggle to a switch and I ended up stuck in one of those position randomly, which meant restarting the game… I actually spent most of my 2 hours of playtime trying to get a decent 1080p60 experience, which I didn’t achieve even though I can run a lot of more recent games in 4K 60 FPS or at least 1440p60.I read on the forums that it’s the same for BS2, so it’s a refund for me.Don’t buy it.

So naturally I was heaps excited for this remaster when it was announced and even more excited when I heard I was getting it for free.I started this game up with hopes of greatness and an awesome experience, the same I had from 9 years ago on this games release. So this writting this review is very saddening as I REALLY wanted and hoped this remaster would be great.. but unfortunally it is not.I started playing, I went through the inital start of the game (the crash, the swim and getting the wrench) and it really impressed me, the graphics were somewhat better and the game ran heaps more smoother on Win10. I continued through the game and the flaws started popping up left, right and center. The lighting in the game would look spectacular if there wasn't screen tears everytime you gazed upon it. I experienced missing textures and squares of nothing but black.I continued playing but I was stopped by a game bug that I cannot pass, Cobb sends splicers after you but after you slaughter them.. the game just sits there, you cannot continue on the quest as the game just stops and you're left walking around a hall. This has stopped me in my tracks and I cannot possibly finish the game until it is patched out.I have no idea what the hell happened but 2K mananged to release this game broken and somewhat worse than they did 9 years ago, as this remaster stands today.. it's a mess and I highly recommend buying the original over this remaster. Save yourself the $20 they're asking for it.I will edit this when they patch the game, and I hope they can pursade me to change this negative review into a possitive one.- Jack.Edit: Just finished the main campaign and I have to say, I forgot that I was playing a remaster around three hours in. The graphics just weren't that much of an approvement. Disappointing.

I tried disabling mouse acceleration through one of the games .ini files. It worked...kind of... Unfortunately it still feels absolutely horible even with it turned off, so I don't see this being fixed unless someone does some heavy modification to the games sensitivity (which is what the remaster team should have already done). Besides that, after I hacked my first sentry bot, I noticed it was constantly getting stuck on stuff in the environment, which I don't recall happining in my original playthrough. So I think this has even more bugs than the original had which is incredibly disapointing to say the least.

It's an absolutely fantastic game that worked on every level and delivered a one of a kind story and narrative.So why am I giving this game a negative recommendation.  Did they mess it up?Yeah they did.  Bioshock remastered might be remastered.  But it's also got a HUGE number of problems.   First off I'm playing this on an Alienware Alpha with upgraded ram (16 gb of Ram) and a 500 gb Solid state drive.  Almost no other game has a problem with this set up.Somehow Bioshock has an infuriating load time to pull up the MAP..  not the game itself, I mean literally hitting the select button to pull up the map.  Why is there a load time there?   And in addition I have seen soft locks.Now Bioshock is old, there's really not an auto save so if you're working through a level and your game crashes, you're back to the beginning of the level *unless you quick save.""  And quick save is not quick at all.There's a ton of bugs, and something else feels ""off"" this is not the same game I once played.  I don't know if the graphical changes have greatly changed the world, or I already know the story, but this isn't exactly the same game I played almost a decade ago.  It's not nostalgia goggles, there's something wrong with the game.Bioshock is a great game, but after playing this, I'd much rather play the original instead of the remastered.  I love Bioshock I love achievements, this should have been a slam dunk, but instead this is just painful.   What happened 2k?   Were too many people asking for another and you are trying to kill the fan's love of the series?  Because it doesn't work that way, we just learn not to trust your publisher.July 8th 2017.

Such is the risk of revisiting an old game but it feels like because this is freely available for PC, they just didn't even bother to upgrade and adjust for the current standard of what is acceptable quality.The game's textures look incredible and better than ever, but beyond that there's nothing much else here to appreciate. This doesn't do enough to warrant being called a Remaster. The game still uses the terrible audio for weapons (the pistol still sounds like a space ray gun, for example).The game has about four or five graphics options which are all some form of a toggle on/off with no in depth or even standard depth options to edit. Here are a few of the graphics issues:- You can't play in windowed borderless. Just fullscreen and windowed.- You dont know what anti-aliasing you're choosing. It's just a toggle.- It's pretty terrible too, had to force a better one on through nvidia control panel.- V-sync doesn't seem to work at all. Screen tearing is abundant. Fixed it through forcing vsync in nvidia control panel too.- Subtitles box doesn't appear to stretch fully across the screen so it looks odd and distracting.There's not enough here to warrant playing this again. And to be honest, I'd advise just playing the original one on steam. This looks a bit prettier but not enough was done to make it worth while.Watch the dev commentary on Youtube and save 12 gigs of space on your HDD.How disappointing.4/10"

This is a remaster that has done the game credit. All the shaders have been made to make the game 'creepier', with the whole atmosphere of the game had me in a more tense state then when I originally played it. The lights on the Big Daddys in particullar has now given these guys an impression that you do not want to f*ck around with them.Overall, the game is a masterpiece.

There are alot of minor problems (like the game being set on controller mode by default, certain settings resetting after closing the game, etc.) Those can be fixed quite easily by the player if he wants, but I agree that they need to be patched. As for the bigger bugs (such as the ''Pick up the completed EMP bomb'' text that keeps popping up until the end of the game, various physics bugs, the occasionnal game crash, and quite a few other returning bugs from the original Bioshock game) these, on the other hand, can be quite dissapointing and can ruin the immersion.Even though there are some bugs, the gameplay and storyline with the upped graphics of the remaster was still a delight to play! The graphical update is very good, some might complain that it's just a reskin of the original with their latest engine but that's what remastering is all about. Of course you can iron out some of the bugs along the way, but the essential purpose of a remake is to present a game to a new audience, who might have missed out the first time around.I agree that they probably released it a bit too soon on PC, but there aren't any gamebreaking bugs, no optimization problems (had it locked at 60 FPS the whole time without ever getting any drops) and everything is where it should be.Another cool thing to play around in is The Museum. It's an awesome addition for the hardcore fans and it can help us understand the thought-process behind the creation of Rapture and the birth of what would become Bioshock. Very interesting stuff.I recommend this, but it might be wise to wait for a patch if you want a flawless experience. The shiny graphics and the great storyline that crafted the Bioshock series make for a great gaming experience."

I don't care what API this game runs with and DX11 is better than DX9 but still old.

Firstly, I must say this was my first time playing any Bioshock game, so unlike some others here, I had no experience with the original. I bought the games a while ago on steam, but never played them. I decided to play through the first game last weekend and realized I had the remastered version in my library. I installed it, started it up, and everything worked flawlessly...at first. About 30 minutes in and the game freezes, crashing to desktop. I restart the game and play through until another crash when finishing the first level and moving on to the second. I reinstalled the game to a different drive and tried to start it up again. This time, everything worked fine until I got to the Arcadia Gardens area, where I attempted to save and the game froze up once again. When I reloaded, all of my quicksave progress had been lost, the files simply deleted. I was extremely frustrated, as the crash had cost me over an hour of gameplay.I researched the problem and realized many other players were experiencing the same problems, all with different solutions. From my own experience, I reinstalled it one last time, but with a few changes. This time, I changed absolutely nothing in the options menu; no controls, graphics, etc. Secondly, I created a new, manual save slot every 10-15 minutes (yes, this is annoying, but it is the only tactic that saved my games correctly). When I started my new playthrough, there were no freezes, no glitches, no crashes. However, when attempting to save two or three various times throughout the game, it did crash to desktop and I had to revert to the most recent save when loading up the game again (which was fine, as I had saved periodically while playing).To conclude, my frequent crashes and freezing seem to have stemmed from some unknown changes in the options menu, either antialiasing, anisotropic filtering, or some other graphical setting. Once these changes were reset to default, I had no crashes or freezes during gameplay, only when manually saving, which happened two or three times. So, I will say my first experience with a Bioshock (Remastered) game was somewhat frustrating, but the storyline, gameplay and graphics were all amazing. I can't recommend the game itself enough. Just take this advice: leave all settings as default, if the game crashes during saving always revert to default settings when it asks you to do so upon booting up the game again, and manually save in a NEW slot EVERY single time and very consistently throughout your gameplay or you will have to replay through large parts of the game. I am about to start Bioshock 2 Remastered, so I will post my experiences there as well once I complete that game. Good luck."

There are multiple problems wrong with this.1)    The first HUGE issue is the fact that the game crashes all the time. I've only completed the first 2 missions and I've crashed a total of 5 times. The game does not autosave very often, so if you crash it's going to set you back a while. The bugs mostly happen around times where you change locations so it's always the worst when you forget to save before finishing the mission and progessing onto the next one.2)    The second issue is the framerate. My PC should be able to run most games at ultra graphics settings, but this game for some reason has huge framerate drops often, and most of the time detracts from the new look of the game.3) The lack of customization is plentiful. In the settings, there are very few things that you can change. For example, I wanted to change the layout of the controls that I was using with my xbox one controller. You can't change anything and the game has a very clunky control set which if it could be changed, would be much more fun to use. You also cannot change the graphics settings like low-high and such, only the screen resolution 1080-1920.4) The game has many graphical bugs such as random blue and red squares appearing in water and around high poly objects, this should be fixed very soon in a patch but it seems strange that they are here in a remastered game.Overall as the game stands now, I would totally not reccomend it. The main things that need to be fixed are the crashing bugs, visual bugs, and the addition of customizable controls because the current layout on an xbox controller is not very good. I'll rate better once these changes are done."

I mean... all I see here is SLIGHTLY more textures and even less graphical options in the menu than the original game. WITH MORE BUGS... CRITICAL BUGS. I reinstalled the ORIGINAL Bioshock and guess what, NO Crashing, no lag when accessing the map or menu at all, no crashing when saving the game.

But how’s the remastered version?So the game looks a bit better, textures are sharper, lightning is improved, particle and water effects are prettier, but in general there is no major upgrade here. I mainly played the game in 2 hour sessions, so in some sessions it run great with no problems to speak of, and sometimes it crushed like 10 times or more during these sessions, so I had to save game each 5 minutes, and it really took me out of experience. Game runs on Unreal Engine 3, so it has it’s signature problem – random texture pop-ins, they are not as severe as you would see in older tittles like Singularity, but still they  persist and are happening quite often.Great addition to the game are films about creating and developing Bioshock, which are scattered around the world as collectibles. Also when you have finished the game, you gain accesses to the Museum of Bioshock, where you can see some ideas which were in development, but never made in to the original game.So to sum it up, game is a graphical upgrade, but nothing impressive, game is unstable, and from what I’ve read on Steam’s review section, it runs even worse for some people. I would not recommend this version for people who are new to the franchise, but  if it gets more stable and playable, it would be a nice revisit for those who enjoy the franchise."

I normally could play about 5 or 6 minutes before the game would crash to desktop.  After I logging back in I would have to redo all my settings and keybinds only to have it crash again in another few minutes and then repeat this process over and over again.Needless to say I gave up on this game after about 5 crashes and will not touch it again unless 2K releases some patches for it.

I have 2 monitors and am often watching something or doing work while playing and having to run the game in windowed mode with a border. The lack of other graphics settings rather sad as well. Resolution selections above 1920x1080 is rather sad, where you can get around that by editing the game setting files, but for a novice that's not an option. Honestly the game looks, slightly better than the origional but I've modded my origional version to look just as good if not better than this ""remaster.""

Buy it but then just play the original version that steam gives you. Don't play the remastered versionFirst off, let me just say that Bioshock is one of my favorite games of all time. It's definitely a game I would recommend to anyone interested in an atmospheric, story based shooter. The original version is still available and you get it in this package if you didn't own it already. I honestly didn't see any problems with the original version. When it was announced they were remastering it I wondered why. It still looks fine even after 9 years and the PC port was manageable even with the mouse acceleration/sensitivity problems.This ""remastered"" version seems more like a glorified retexturization which isn't what this game deserves at all. It still has the original annoyances of the old version with limited graphics options and poor mouse navigation in the menus. Any bugs that were in the original are still here in this version.Honestly the graphics improvement isn't that noticable. Like I said, the original looks fine in my opinion. And unless you've played the original extensively you probably won't be able to tell the difference unless shown a side by side comparison of the two. It feels like they just added HD textures and called it good.What annoys me the most is that you can't buy the original versions separately, you have to get it in the bundle with the remastered edition. Which means the cost of buying the entire Bioshock series went up by $20. Kind of makes it hard to convince people to try a 9 year old game when its as expensive as it is.So to whether or not I recommend this version. I don't know. To me it just feels like a lazy way for the developer to cash in on the franchise again after 9 years. I still love Bioshock, but I'm just disappointed with this supposed Remaster. But if you haven't played the series before, this is probably the way to go. So I'll give it a thumbs up."

Graphics are beautiful and the game runs smoothly enough.It's worth to note though that at times, this version doesn't like to render or load certain textures until you get close enough to it or it gets a moment to think.  Nothing that strongly affects the gameplay, but is a little sloppy for what a remastered version of a game is supposed to be and do.This version also likes to get fussy and pout if it crashes, wanting to forget what your previous settings were.If you get this product and have too many issues, the old version is included, though the old version's PC port has been noted to be atrocious at times.Otherwise, it's about the same exact thing as you could expect since this is Bioshock 1 remastered.  Everything about the intial game can be said here to the same capacity.  The story, characters, setting, and gameplay are all incredibly solid and satisfiying.  The game itself constantly likes to put you on edge and really feel the dread and isolation of the environment and setting.But the issues persist.  The abilities you were taught to use heavily in the beginning later become useless as enemies become immune to those tactics outright.  Hacking, while unique and offers a mix up to the FPS action, gets repeatitive and often breaks up the regular gameplay a little too much.  Increasing the potency of certain abilities is not very well rewarded, nor are you required to upgrade in a particular order, encouraging savy players to simply wait until the final upgrades are available.  Researching enemies is a little bit of a chore.  There's not much in the way to offer alternative objectives outside of point a to b other than upgrading abilties to some extent.Even with all that said though, Bioshock 1 is one of very few FPS experiences I personally enjoy and does enough to really sell its survival horror elements.  I easily recommend this game to anyone that could enjoy a FPS on a bare minimum level as it does enough to keep many people engaged."

Let me explain why this is such a travesty...1. Not only does this 'remaster' not really improve graphics that much, but it has LESS options for your graphics, you can modify about 3-4 things and that's it, anything else you HAVE to go into the .ini file. It's absolutely shameful, the non-remastered Bioshocks had more ways to tweak2. The remaster does not fix any of the old bugs in the Bioshock games, unforgiveable for an alleged 'remaster' but even worse, the 'remasters' introduce entirely NEW bugs that can result in your game being unwinnable at certain locations(example, at Fort Frolic, there's a room where one of the disciples Cohen has you hunting sics some splicers on you, you have to defeat them before you are allowed to leave the room, but...and it's a pretty big butt, what do you do if the splicers glitch out, and never drop down from the ceiling to attack you? And you can't get them out, nor kill them, wham you are permanently trapped in the room, enjoy reloading).And that's just the tip of the iceberg, I haven't even found all the bugs, I have no desire to, they're that infuriating.Those are the main reasons this 'remaster' is such a bad joke, I can't begin to comprehend how this disgusting slap in the face of Bioshock fans came to be, apparently based on one of the logos loading on opening up the game, and what I'm otherwise hearing, not only did Irrational, the original games creators not handle this remaster, it was instead given to some no name developer studio I've never heard about called Blind Squirrel.Well Blind Squirrel, I wish I was blind after this awful joke you've played on me, your incompetence is astounding, as is your laziness and sheer lack of good work ethic. Obviously the proper time, care, and passion was NOT given to this.And that's just unbelievable, Bioshock deserves better, it deserved respect, from 2k, from Blind Squirrel, and it didn't bloody well get the respect it deserved, not only did Bioshock deserve that respect, so did WE the fans.So yea, don't get this crap"

I have not crashed yet (taken pictures, quickly cycled through weapons and plasmids, changed graphical settings at will) nor have i encountered interface bugs or gameplay issues. I ONCE noticed an FPS drop the FIRST TIME i cycled through weapons and plasmids quickly, which only lasted a few seconds.The game itself is of course amazing. The original Bioshock is legendary, and this nice coat of paint does exactly what a remaster is intended to do (make the graphics somewhat modern and cleanup gameplay). The easier transition between weapons and plasmids is welcome and the intense atmosphere feels even heavier with the improved shadows and lighting.Maybe I just got lucky and my system is ""simpatico"" with the game, but if you have never played Bioshock or looking to head back to rapture, or just want to play a true masterpiece of gaming, this is it!"

The combination of a great story and fantastic gameplay with wonderful scenery has been so well created into an all around well crafted game that it would be a shame to miss out on playing it.
,Recommended,409710,28239495,"Posted: 7 December, 2016",all,Infinity,"Absolutely recommend.Bioshock is widely regarded as a classic and is critically acclaim. I can see why.  tl;dr: ASIDE GAME CRASHING (SAVE OFTEN), the gameplay, atmosphere, story and story telling techniques are incredibly well designed. That said, it's a very lonely and dark game. Some horror included.Gameplay:Weapon choice is plentiful, be it plasmid, tonic or gun. You are given wide latitude to choose how you build your character. The only downside to this is that because the discovery of all the items is staggered, you may have committed to a certain playstyle by the time another one reveals itself. No detrimental bugs in gameplay besides crashing.Atmosphere:This is where the Bioshock series excel. The game is linear, so it's pretty easy for the devs to tell a narrative, but how it's done and what the narrative is are most important. The surroundings, the dialogue, the music, the level design all demonstrate how well thought out the game is. When the game wants to send a shiver down your spine, your spine dances. When the game wants to blow your mind, it makes you set the bombs without knowing it. Then, BOOM.Loneliness:You never get close to a regular human. They're always behind doors or scampering away. Logically, this is probably to prevent you from wacking everyone you see, but it still gets lonely. I hadn't known that the game was a horror one, which also explains the loneliness, but sometimes it gets to you.Throughout the story, you do actions without question. Then, you're forced to question everything. 10/10"

No argument there.However, while the original Bioshock was a PC masterpiece with settings out the butt to tinker with to get the best balance of eye candy and performance as needed at the time, and with native surround-monitor setup support, this re-release has a number of issues that 2K's official support has yet refused to address.Even setting aside the limited options given, and the default behavior of ignoring keyboard and mouse input if a controller is detected, the biggest thing keeping me from being able to play it at all, is that as soon as the cutscenes are over, I get no sound, at all. It hasn't mattered what settings I set for the audio. It hasn't mattered what audio drivers I use for the sound card in my machine. It hasn't mattered with trying any of the supposed fixes listed on the Steam forums, or on other sites talking about this re-release yet. This is clearly common enough if non-user forums are even reporting about it, but 2K has yet to fully address it, because I basically am still getting no sound at all. And for a game that practically begged for the kind of phonic masterpiece of the setting, this is inexcusable.Oddly enough, if it weren't for this, the fact that it would run at 4K on my setup reporting well over 100fps is nothing short of remarkable.

I finally installed it and in anticipation I launched the game. Got to the main menu and it looks as if the game is ""spliced"" on my screen. The bottom portion (where the buttons to accept game changes are) is completely cut off. Let me add that my aspect ratio is 1920x1200. So in frustration to try and change my graphics settings I changed the aspect ratio to 1920x1080. Well now it looks like it fits my screen (of course not properly)Well because I want to check out the glory of this game, I might just ignore this glaring issue that could have been so easily prevented (c'mon this is a PC game) I am then finally able to change my graphics options, and the overly sensitive mouse settings. I get back to the main menu and am ready to launch the game....What is this? I can move my mouse but can't click on a single option in the menu. NOTHING. I am forced to hit escape, then hit the enter key to then exit the game. Which by the way, right from the get-go I could see this game is a console port, a very poorly done one at that.I am not as angry as I would have been if I had actually paid money for this game. Luckily because I already own the original bioshock I was able to get the Remastered edition for free. Well, looks like i'm going back to playing my current play session on the ""old"" bioshock. Which at least lets me enter the game, and lets me play at the resolution of which my screen doesn't look squished because of 1920x1080.Bioshock is a 9 year old game. It goes to show where the gaming industry is at today, the fact that a ""remastered' edition of a 9 year old game can't even perform the way it did. I will continue playing the non-broken version of bioshock. I really was excited to try this, but the fact that I can't even get past the main menu is game breaking for me. I quit the game and went back in to see if I could potentially get back in. It worked, I got 2 minutes in the game to ""save"" to then find out that I couldn't access the menu options again. Same thing as before. Well damn, I've got to exit I suppose. Well I can't. So, I alt+tab out to manually close the game. It wouldn't even let me do that, I had to kill the game in my task manager. What a distaster.People reading these reviews and see the current ""mixed"" please don't spend your money on the current state of this game. It's not worth it.If you want to play bioshock, go back to the 2007 version....oh wait, on steam you can no longer buy the original, you now have no choice but to pay 50% more in price because the only option they give you is to buy the original and the remastered version. You only want the one you say? well too bad.

Except for a few problems:1. When I alt-tab out to check other programs, and I go back into the game, I get a black screen. I can hear all the noises going on in the game, but I can't see♥♥♥♥♥♥ Then after a while of waiting, it just crashes. The f**k?2. Why is it, whenever I quit the game, and then I go back in, my custom key bindings get reset back to default? Why is this a thing? I prefer my own key bindings thank you very much, and I refuse to conform to the default bindings.3. Why is it that sometimes, even though I'm just using a mouse and keyboard, the game somehow thinks I'm using a controller, when I have none of the sorts plugged in?4. Why is the sensitivity slider ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? I put to minimum sensitivity, and it's like my mouse is suffering through retardation, unable to smoothly glide properly across the screen, just stuttering across.And these are only SOME of the bugs I found in this game.I really want to love this, I do. BioShock is my all time favorite game so far, and remastering it was like a dream come true for me. But with all these annoying bugs, you're making it really hard for me to love this remastered version.

,Recommended,409710,32460129,Posted: 15 June,all,Zarozax,"Honestly ths game feels like the most definitive experience in atmospheric narrative driven shooters. The story is immersive and full of grandeur, while still making statments about concepts applicable to a non-Rapture world.The sound design is probably one of the game's greatest strengths, in that I was always on my toes as I went through each area as all the noises I heard constantly made me feel as though something was going to appear out of nowhere. That is terror atmosphere done right. The gameplay was very intuitive and responsive, though the swapping between weapons and plasmids was a little bit clunky when you're in the middle of a fight.  The difficulty of the enemies had a very appropriate curve, but the game overall was EXTREMELY forgiving. Almost no consequences for dying.The primary complaint I would have with the game is that the remastered game is a bit poorly optimized. During my playthrough I had to deal with some corruption issues and freezes/hangups. Other than that, the game really is a must-play."

You should save often so in case it crashes you won't lose 30 minutes of work like I did.There is a small glitch with flickering lights which when there is supposed to be a static screen on a TV or a small flickering light, your entire monitor will flicker instead.There is a GIGANTIC difficulty spike in the first three levels of the game in which you have no ammo, no Eve, little to no amount of first aid packs, and of course no money. Be sure to be stealthy in the beggining of the game otherwise you will be in a pinch.There is a section where you have to defend a little sister near the end of the game and it is a right pain in the a**A lot of the game is fetch quests.PROS:The city of Rapture is incredibly lifelike and really make it feel like you're there.The horror atmosphere of Rapture really blends in to its certain style and adds even mor to the realismAmazing charactersIncredible voice acting Armin Shimerman who voiced Andrew RyanYou'll be intrigued by the history of Rapture and I guarantee you'll go to a wiki and read about itPlasmids (Genetic Enhancements) can be applied to yourself and you can use them as weapons which inspires you to make devastating combos using guns and plasmids together.Rapture and it's levels are huge and you can take your time to find the secret rooms in the game.The Graphics are amazingI highly recommend that you buy Bioshock which also comes with the remastered version which is arguably better."

,Recommended,409710,29588408,Posted: 30 January,all,DietDeath,"Bioshock Remastered(Also Known as ""Questionable Improvement""Score (Base Game): 8.5/10Score (Remastered): (2/10)Underlying Point of my Review: If you got this for free, play it for its marginal improvements, if your looking to play bioshock for the first time, you may as well get this one because it has achievements on steam and trading cards (but only nab it on sale or get it from other resale sights) at a lower cost.Bioshock, one of the first games that made me think, it defined alot of my growth as an individual by inspiring me to read the ideological works of Ayn Rand and her collection of books (The Fountainhead, Altas Shrugged, and Anthem if you're intrested in the philosophy behind much of the game and the potential effects of an anarchistic free market capitalist society). It was not that I agreed with either the author in her perception, nor that I agreed with Levine and his teams prideful distaste, but it inspired me to develop my own opinions regarding my political and moral development. The games sense of choice, one that is paralleled in ""Bioshock Infinite"", causes the player to think in a linear story sense in such a manner that I feel it championed the idea and was only dethroned by the modern rendition of ""The Heart of Darkness"" by Joseph Konrad titled ""Spec Ops: The Line"" which excells at causing the player to think with a limited sense of choice (But thats besides the point). Bioshock is aged in graphics, and in complete honesty I thought the remaster made it look worse in many cases, the water and fluid dynamics looked unchanged and the artistic rendition of alternate art decopunk world often times lost the illuminated style of the original games. When playing this remastered game do not expect the potential modern engine fufillments that you may find in such games as the ""Metro"" series Redux remasters. Bioshock is a good game and there's a small degree more content in this game that makes it desireable, however it is not a game worthy of the title remastered, perhaps it should be called more aptly, ""Bioshock: Rereleased"" in order to revitalize profits for a new, largely unaware, consumer base.In conclusion: Buy this game, but not because its ""remastered"" a word as stated above I have a subtle distaste to use, but because I feel it is a genre defining video game classic and one of Levine's finest creations to date. Bioshock is Bioshock, and for that it deserves a playthrough (or a rerun if you've played before). Of course you don't have to play because I said so as of course...""A man chooses, a slave obeys""-Andrew Ryan"

I thought I learned from my mistakes, so I saved manually once in a while.

And you know, after nine years and two and three-quarters of a sequel, it's still a good game. Feel free to skip this if you've already played it, but if you're looking to buy it for the first time, here's my short two cents on the game. While it's more of a shooter than a horror game, it delivers some genuinely unsettling moments. The aesthetic is unique, the atmosphere is intriguing, the pacing is comfortable, and the flamethrower is hilariously overpowered. It's good, spooky fun, with a lot of character and just enough cheese.Re: the remaster vs the original. It has the same bugs. The controls are a bit fidgety. Mine crashed once, but only once. I don't know what everyone expected; this is an update that flat-out does not cost any more than the cost of the original. If I'd had to pay extra, I would expect a MUCH more polished product, but as it stands, I'm just enjoying the game again with the added bonus of the new graphics. The resources are updated in all the right places, no Lucas-style additions that try to wow us with the new engine by adding in things that mess with the original."

In comparison of what other people wrote about it in the past few months, this seems rather acceptable.I still recommend to save manually every now and then - and do not overwrite your saves! Save into a new slot or at least make a couple of saves and then overwrite the oldest one, if you wanna save space.I do not know how to prevent the game from crashing - but there are some Ini tweaks one can make. As to how much they help - i can not tell. While crashing is always annoying.. i never really bothered looking for fixes since they happend hours apart.The GameNowadays i often come across games with a plot that is obvious after 5 minutes of gameplay - meaning, i already know all the plot twist that gonna happen hours before they actually happen. BioShock on the other hand (the whole Series actually) is very good at surprising you. While you might get an idea here and there whats happening.. there are definitely moments where plot twist happen that you never really thought of - and i like that.Exploring instead of running towards the next mission objective is often rewarded immensely and the feeling of finding that hidden Weapon Upgrade bench is just..""Ka-Ching.. Jackpot!"" like. I like that aswell.As to the rest of the game itself.. well.. i'm gonna leave that to you. Don't wanna spoil all the satisfaction.PerformanceApart from some small FPS drops when loading into an area (after the loading screen) and some brief texture pop-ins (after the loading screen) the game is running great and stable on 60 FPS for me.CPU: i7 7700kGPU: ASUS GTX 1080RAM: 16 GB DDR4Installed on a WD Black HDD.Why buy the Remaster?Honestly - i never played the Original Bioshock so i cant compare them.What i know tho is that the ""old"" BioShock was capped at 30 FPS while this Remaster is running stable on 60 FPS.That alone is enough reason for me why one should get the Remaster.Besides - if you buy the whole Collection, like it did, you get the Original Bishock (non-remaster) aswell.Author's NoteI'm not the best at writing reviews since my mind tends to just wander off into.. i dunno where - but i hope i made some people buy this awesome game (series).

I also played through the original back in the day when it came out, so nostalgia may somewhat cloud my judgement too.I intend to review this game in 2 ways, firstly as a game, secondly as a remaster, scoring each part separately, whilst listing the pro's and con's in each instance and then I'll close with an overall statement and score.Firstly, as a GAME (10/10):PROS- Story: From the characters, the setting, the way events unfold, I can't really fault it.- Gameplay: The variety of powers and weapons makes for some really interesting combat, and the light RPG elements of upgrades and character customisation are great too.- Graphics: Whilst the visuals are a bit dated now the art direction of the game is still top notch, Rapture is a beautifully realised city heavily influenced by Art Deco and due to it's fall from grace has a destroyed beauty appeal to it as well.CONS- Length: If anything I just wished the game was longer as I enjoyed every minute of it.Secondly then, as a REMASTER (4/10):PROS- Extras: It's good to have all DLC bundled together, as well as Developer Videos to find throughout your journey.CONS- Graphics: Not much care seems to have been taken to vastly improve the graphics, as I said before the art direction is strong, still it would have been nice to see, for example, better textures.- Customisation: There are very few graphics options with this remaster, whilst not a deal breaker for me, I know this is something sort after by a lot of people.- Stability: Game crashed on me a handful of times during my initial playthrough, whilst not the end of the world, each time this happended it reset my graphics and gameplay options, as well as which developer vidoes I'd collected (I kept saves near each one in the story to combat this). Specifically, each time this happened the difficulty and vita chamber options reset (I was playing on survivor with vita chambers off) so when the game loaded back up I changed the difficulty back up and the vita chambers back off, I still got the achievements associated with the higher difficulties and vita chambers thankfully.- Controls: Whilst I play with a controller and didn't run into any issues, I've read that there are issues when using a mouse and keyboard so I'll simply state that here as a con for controls. I have read that they are working on patching this soon, at the time of writing this review.OVERALL (7/10)In the end I would still recommend this to any fan of Bioshock, or anyone who has never played the game before, perhaps with the caveat that you use a controller (due to the known mouse issues). Bioshock for me is one of my all time favourite games and it really is good to be back in Rapture."

I was somewhat biased or mesmerized by the fact that Bioshock remastered got mixed reviews with many complaining about bugs, glitches, crashes and other flaws. After giving it a shot about playing this game changed my perspective........I've played for around 18 hours.. That ain't much but i completed the campaign. Truth to be told, i thoroughly enjoyed it. My rig isn't the state of the art type and its somewhat dated, however I never experienced any bugs, abrupt crashes or glitches for now. Probably 2k patches have worked apparently...Nevertheless, I'll make sure to update my reviews, should i ever encounter any probs afterwards while playingTalking about the game, it's just the same old Bioshock. However one thing is, despite i maxed all the display settings, there isn't much huge difference if you compare it with the former. I expect this remastered version shoudn't disappoint the bioshock fans. Try it out, you won't regret it ! :)This time, however you wont be able to collect anything from downed sentry bots as they don't leave any debris behind when destroyed..One thing many people have experienced is the windowed black screen while launching.

However, gamers don’t play Bioshock to gain philosophic insight, at least this gamer doesn’t, but to wander through one of the most breathtaking worlds in all of gaming while rescuing pitiable “Little Sisters” and sending demented  Splicers to their eternal rest. Now that’s memorable gaming!As for utopia crumbling into dystopia, we are playing in Ryan’s playground, his dream of a better world, and, well, if his dream turned into a nightmare then we can revel in the nightmare, and if we speculate at all, perhaps it would be to ponder the vanity of human wishes.Just so happens I’m 60 plus years and I would recommend the entire Bioshock series to other “seasoned gamers”, with the caveat that if you have a heart condition like me, you’ll want to play on the easy setting. As in all action role playing games there are jolting surprises as you journey on. As for eyesight issues, there is not a lot a lot of small print in these games and the lighting is adjustable in the options panel. The Bioshock games certainly stimulate “les petites cellules grises” to borrow a phrase from Hercule Poirot and while requiring some manual dexterity the game allows for planning as opposed to mindless button mashing."

Nothing is forced, you learn about the gameplay the world and the people yourself, this game you could rush through, or take your time, find  every tonic and plasmid and little sister. At times it is a survival horror, at times it is just a satire game, othertimes its a mindnumbing shooter without the mindnumbingness its more like toenumbingness because of how much you will be on your toes.Just play it already, this review will be even more broken if I write anymore, it will break your heart at some points, and make you angry at others and make you feel every emotion in a perfect ratio that gives you pure satisfaction.Play ItEdit: Just after writing this review I remembered that this is fairly buggy, eg saving sometimes and definately in a elevator or Bathasphere the game will crash and not save, also a fair bit of crashes and when you upgrade a Plamsid it will mess up the order as well as if you pick up a pistol whist fighting Peachie the pistol and wrench will swap"

So go play the entire franchise, it's an amazing story!The worldbuilding is really cool - every now and then you can get a decent view to the outside ocean - a few more times would've been cool. The fact that Reapture is under water (while looking cool) isn't used game-mechanically as much as I hoped (e.g. in the 2nd Bioshock you actually wander around on the bottom of the atlantic outside of the buildings).For me as a casual, everything felt a bit too overwhelming with all the mechanics they tried to built into the game: multiple passive abilites, active ones (called plasmids) with their respective upgrades, crafting, weapon upgrades, multiple ammo-types per weapon, hacking minigame etc...Also it felt too much like a survival game as ammo became extremly sparse towards the end for me on the easiest difficulty, but maybe I'm just too noob ^^Towards the end I grew tired of the repetitive fights and constantly switching weapons and speeded through tbh.

I remember running it on my crappy PC and having some issues at the time with occasional bugs. However, the game was absolutely amazing and I believe it really shaped gaming as a whole. I was excited to see I got a free version of Bioshock remastered and figured I would revisit it. In fact Bioshock 2 was my favorite of the trio and I had intended to buy the remastered version soon.The game is a bug-ridden nightmare. It is hard for me to even fathom that my souped up new computer, of which I am incredibly proud, of cannot run Bioshock as well as I could run this game 10 years ago on a computer held together by glue and a boys obsession with video games.I was excited to see a patch came out recently. I shouldn't have been. It actually messed up my settings so badly that for some reason it thought I was using an X-box controller? and then it reset my difficulty without asking so I was no longer on a Hard run. Thus that achievement is no longer attainable until I restart again and I already watched the start of Bioshock like 10 times because my computer kept crashing.My advice: If you have played Bioshock before then this is nothing new or good.

I don't know if this was intentional or not but it's not game breaking.A second thing I noticed was that items wouldn't move on conveyer belts, rather the items would just appear at the end location early, allowing me to obtain the grenade launcher a little early.Speaking of getting items early, I noticed that the little sisters would deliver the teddy bear you get for sparing all the little sisters before actually saving any little sisters. I also didn't get the voice comm from Tennenbaum confirming that I saved all the little sisters.As for crashing, I haven't noticed anything like that but I wouldn't rule it out givin the reviews before me.I can't recommend this game because as a remaster it shouldn't be worse in some aspects to the original and while these bugs are seemingly not game breaking, they are an extreme oversight."

The last time I played the first Bioshock was in 2009 I think and to revisit the game after all these years felt very refreshing, especially since I just finished Burial at Sea parts 1 and 2. If you love Bioshock and Rapture, you owe yourself a visit in this glorious Remastered version! The atmosphere was amazing in the original release, and in this version it succeeds exceeding it. Highly recommended!I have to admit I was a bit cautious when getting this game since alot of people seemed to complain about the crashes and glitches. For those worrying I have to say: don't. In my 20+ hrs it took me to finish the game, it crashed only once, and it was somewhere early in the game. Other than that the game ran flawlessly with no hiccups. I'm guessing that crash might've happened because of memory overload on my GPU (GTX 770 2gb), which was caused by bad optimization of a certain area in the game or something? Dunno, but as I said, it was the only crash that happened to me.All in all, if you love Bioshock universe, get this game. And play it in UHD."

Instead I am still underwater and either fall to my death or fall and survive then get to walk around a little bit and then fall some more to my death. If they fix this and I get to see more of the 'remaster' then I would most likely change my review, untill then I stays as a non-recomendation."
,Not Recommended,409710,25538937,"Posted: 16 September, 2016",all,[D0gfish],"EDIT 10-12-2016: The game has been patched to solve some major issues, particularly with abnormal resolution support, issues with config files being reset, and the beoken mouse. The mouse does feel much better (although it feels like there's still some slight acceleration going on) and the issues with randomly changing sensitivity and really janky movement in the menus are fixed. I've been playing the game for a while now and enjoying it (it is still Bioshock, after all), and so far I haven't had any major issues yet. There are reports from others of crashes that may have been introduced in this patch, but I have not encountered any so far. I have experienced occasional and seemingly random framerate slowdowns that are minor but still frustrating considering all the other issues.In its current state, the game seems to be working OK, but I still would have a hard time reccomending it as a paid product. If you have the original and have been holding off playing your free copy, I'd say that now would be a good time to give it a try; but if you're planning on buying this remaster, be aware that it may not be a smooth experience.BUYER BEWARE! This is a terrible port. Nothing has been fixed from the 2007 version that I can tell.Here's all the problems I have encountered in the first few minutes of the game:-I had to make the settings ini file read-only to stop it from resetting them on startup-The mouse smoothing is absolutely unacceptable and there is no way to turn it off in the game. It feels like it's trying to emulate an analog stick, it's bad enough that it makes me a bit sick and there's no way I'd be able to aim with any accuracy. You can turn it off in the ini files, but you'll need to make the files read-only or they reset.-Mouse sensitivity is way too high, and on the lowest settings the broken smoothing severely affects the menu cursor. Fixing the smoothing in the ini files seems to sometimes fix this, and sometimes not. The sensitivity seems to change in-game randomly - sometimes it feels significantly lower, then increases, sometimes it's too high.-The game crashed on startup in Windows 7 without the Platform Update installed - to be fair, this is listed in the system requirements, but this is the first game I've ever seen in my life that requires a specific (optional) Windows update to even start properly-Advanced graphics options present in the original game have been removed - not a big deal, it's not like many people will need to turn things down to run it, but frustrating to see these settings outright removed-The FOV option consists of two choices: terrible, and OK (looks like 90 degrees to me) - no slider-If you have a controller plugged in it sometimes forces you into controller mode when you start the gameAlso worth noting is the game takes up about 4 times the hard drive space as the original, with not too much to show for it. Textures are a little better, and there are some minor details added here and there, but nothing worth all the technical trouble.People have commented on the original game's technical issues online for 9 years now, and many of these problems are relatively easy to fix. None of them have been fixed as of the time of this review. Do not spend money on this game. I feel dissapointed even having received a free copy.I will update this review if these issues are fixed, but for now, due to shoddy quality of this port, I can't reccomend this over the original."

Even then the game still suffers from most the bugs it had in 2007.Whilst the new textures are nice, I am having terrible issues with some of them taking forever to pop in, with only blurred messes being viewable. Bear in mind that my computer is no potato (4690k, 24gb ram, 780ti). An example of this is when the plane's tail crashes into the tunnel. The plane's tail looked like it had passed through Half-Life on the way down, as it was a blurry mess, the texture for it eventually popped in, but only after about 10 seconds. Also bear in mind that I have the game on a 128GB SSD, so loading times for the textures should not be an issue.Also some of the splicer's shadows appear to be missing or bugged as when I got the the pram with the revolver in it, the splicer had no shadow on the wall to the left, which was in the original. When she moved, a massive black square appeared on the wall for a moment, which leads me to believe the shadows are bugged for me in some way. When the splicers were breaking though the glass at the end of the level, only 2 of the splicers had shadows, the other splicer only had a rectangular shadow.I have also had issues with sounds. The menu music and introductory cutscene's audio sounded awful, and some sounds in game cut out. This may be attributed to my ancient audio card (Audigy 2 ZS), but I have noticed that others are also having this problem. I can recommend a program called Creative ALchemy, which fixed sounds on the original, so if you are having issues with this game and your Creative soundcard, give it a try, as it fixed the sounds cutting out for me.I can't really recommend this at the moment, it is less stable than the original and in some cases looks and sounds worse."

That's something like five hours' worth of progress gone.Then I looked online and saw that tons of people were having the very same problems.

I had heard a lot of great things about this game, some even calling it the greatest video game of all time. Now, having played the game I fully agree, Bioshock is no doubt one of the best games I've ever played.The story, which is mainly told in the form of audio diaries, is unlike anything I've experienced before. It's dark and disturbing yet beautiful and euphoric. The voice acting and audio are second to none and the visuals holds up well for a 10 year old game with updated graphics. The gameplay is so much fun and extremely satisfying with many different weapons and ways to approach an objective. Honestly it's hard to describe just how good this game is, I can simply urge everyone to try this game in order to understand just what I mean. It's really a must-buy.The only couple of complaints I have with the game is that sometimes when attempting to listen to an audio diary, there's a little too much sound around you which leads to some of the monologues in the diary becoming hard to hear. I also encountered a bug in which, without going to much into detail as it's story related, a splicer I was supposed to photograph spawned and then dissapeared. Simply reloading an older save solved the problem but apparently this bug has been present ever since the original release and one could have hoped that they'd have fixed it in a remastered version.Nevertheless, Bioshock is a wonderful game showcasing that video games actually can be a work of art. 10/10On a sidenote, the game ran wonderfully on my rig (i5-6400 and gtx 1060 6GB). I always had a stable 150-200 fps during gameplay and >400 fps during cutscenes"

If you save and notice that you have fewer saves then you should, quit the game back to windows and reload the save.2. After using the sphere to go to another zone, save your game, quit the game (back to windows) then reload.3. Keep an eye on your inventory.

But you'd think that in the REMASTERED version, they would have LESS bugs, crashes, etc. I have had to repeat so many aspects of the game due to crashes. But here's the kicker! Saving won't help! I'm posting this after losing all of my play time for the evening. Allow me to explain. This game does a weird thing where, when saving, it will crash. Now, I'm a cautious person. I keep a different save file for each area. If I did not do that, I would have had to start the game over a good five times. I was saving after saving the FINAL LITTLE SISTER OF THE GAME, AND THE THIRD IN THE AREA, and the game crashed.This means, not only is all of the progress I made since the last save gone, but as it DELETES the previous save to make room over the new one, I lost ALL OF THAT PROGRESS TOO!! I may as well have just spent a few hours with the game open, staring at it like an idiot. I want to scream. That's a good 2 hours I just lost, and this isn't the first time this has happened! I understand it's an older game. But playing the original on Xbox, two years beore the remaster even came out, with none of these problems is unacceptable.Sure, story is great, if you can ever GET THROUGH IT. Weapons are cool, IF YOU CAN EVER SELECT THE ONE YOU WANT! There is absolutely no excuse for a game this buggy, in it's second incarnation.

Everything else works flawlessly except that the aimming with mouse feels a bit weird. Nothing too bad just an odd feeling to it that you just need to get used to. Runs at 4k 60fps max settings using SLI GTX 980.Graphics:I played BioShock twice back on PS3 and never really played it on PC except for now with the Remastered Version. The games look so much better. Textures are great and character models are amazing. They are not 2016 standerds but they are a great remastered graphics of an old game.The Game:I'm sure you've heard that BioShock 1 is an amazing game and it is. Even though I played the games many times before, I had so much fun playing it and can still say this is an amazing and fun game with great story and atmosphere and it's way better than the latest BioShock.If you haven't played BioShock 1 before, you should get this.

I imagine paying for a remastered version of an older game--repackaged with the same bugs wholecloth--might put off some buyers. I played Bioshock originally on consoles, and never picked up the Steam version I purchased. So a free upgrade is a great excuse to get back into it. Make no mistake, this is still one of the better-crafted gaming experiences you can find.For that reason I recommend it: If you've played it before, if you know what you're in for, if you know Bioshock, you want this (and will get it for free, I believe?) And the developer commentary is worth it, although it, too, assumes you've played the game. If you haven't ever touched Bioshock before, you're getting what you'd get anyway, just prettier and with some achievements (and bugs.) But now, developer commentary, a lovely museum, lots of fun new things that really makes it worth it, I think.Caveats: controller support make the wonky controls easier to handle. Also ran fine on my 1920x1080 display, so can't speak to anything beyond that."

But, I have played through the original a few times. This game crashed 5 times in those two and a half hours! This might just be me, so I'll get to the other reasons.Pros:The graphics are slightly better than the original.They added a few new maps/modes. (I will come back to these later)The physics engine runs at the same speed as the rest of the game, instead of at 15 fps at all times.The splicers and little sisters look less like wax statues and more like normal humans.Cons:The remastered graphics in 1 and 2 are only slightly better and don't come close to Infinite's.The new maps/modes only come with one map each. These are actually really good ideas, but 2K didn't add enough content.The museum was a great idea and for a fan of the series, like me, it would help us look back at Irrational's scraped ideas. But the execution was horrible! Were there any sound files? Or downloadable music from the game?I might be nit-picking by now, but why are the Golden Reels so obscure? Why cant we just watch them from the start? I want to know more about Ken Levine's thought process behind the game before 2K went and screwed it all up.Overall, 2K really predicted their own screw-up in Bioshock 2's opening cutscene...shooting themselves in the head. This is one of the most beloved series in gaming history, and 2K goes out and screws it all up just because they needed more developers for NBA2K900000, or whatever they're at by now.EDIT: So apparently 2K is going to fix the crashes and other things that the community has been complaining about. (Even though it should have been fixed before the game came out!) If they fix it, and they fix it well, I will change my review. Otherwise I'm just going to say that 2K is worse than Activision and EA combined, ruining a beloved series just to make some money."

I also want to say that this is the first version I have played on the PC so my comparisons will be made from the version I played on the 360.I loved the original BioShock. I played it on the 360 a long time ago and it was beautiful. The story was great, it scared the crap out of me at certain spots, the scenery - Rapture - was just amazing, and there was only one bug I found while trying to get an achievement. The Remastered game is not as enjoyable to play.The Bad:- The first bug I encountered was just after installing the game. I clicked play on steam and it crashed. No logo appeared or anything it just crashed with an error saying that something went wrong and asked me if I wanted to reset the settings to default. I clicked yes and it loaded up after I clicked play again.- This version has one audio bug that is found multiple times throughout the game from what I've played so far. Audio will start to play then half way through it goes back to the begining of the clip and will do that usually one more time before it finishes playing the whole audio clip.- Another bug that has shown up a few times is when I die the wall closest to me will disappear and I can see the ocean and buildings around me.- Another issue that I've had and that has to do with the targeting while using plasmids. I have snuck up on enemies at very close range a few times and hit them with a plasmid but it goes right through them or hits them but won't do anything.- A huge bug that irritated me was during the first time you meet a big daddy the game speeds up the mouse movement but at the same time the graphics get really choppy. I almost quit playing at that point because of how bad it was.Those are just the bugs I've found so far and I'm not that deep into the game.The Good:- The audio sounds a lot better than I remember.- The graphics look nicer.- I like the concept museum. It has a lot of cool images and figures you can look over.I would suggest buying the original version of this game over the Remastered. I'm surprised with how many bugs I've found during the standard play through that it was signed off as good to sell. That is really really bad on the company for pushing it out the door or just not paying attention to the issues that are there. I'm going to go back to the original on the PC and see the quality of it compared to the quality of this version. I'll post a review of it when I have time. Till then good luck and don't by this version."

I don't have the ""best gaming pc evurr"", so my game runs at 40-50 FPS (wich is fine by me), the problem is the constant stuttering. Sometimes I'm a huge battle with explosions and hordes of enemies and everything is fine and stable, but then I traverse a door to a simple area with no enemies I have extreme amounts of stutter and render delay. ""Try lowering down the graphics"" you might be thinking, but there almost no graphical options in the menu. Talking about the menus, everything is messed up, I have to constantly check if the game saved my configurtions, for example, I turned off ""adaptive training"", but I still receive the annoying ""do this and do that"" messages, I turned of ""iten highlight"" but itens still shine as if they were made of gold, and the brightness slide simply doesn't work. I also found some bugs that were not present in the original game, like ""Electro Bolt"" not hitting enemies and ""Telekinesis"" acting like there is an invisible wall in front of me, blowing up explosives right in my face. Also, there some things lacking from a ""remastered"" version of the game, for example, you still can't use weapons and plasmids at the same time, and worst of all, characters like Atlas and Tenenbaun still look like ordinary splicers. Don't take me wrong, the new textures and effects are real pretty, but the game suffers from something that has become very frequent these days:developer laziness. The problem is no the remaster itself, but the horrible PC port. For now, you are better off playing the original Bioshock (one of the greatest games of all time). *Quits the game and then realises that your PC becomes incredibly slow, to the point of being unusable, everytime you close the game*"

I love the upgrading and progression system because you build the main character to be this overpowered badass towards the end and it’s a great feeling.

This ""remaster"" is definitely lacking in the ""remastered"" department.

It's exactly that, nothing more, nothing less.I'm also not sure where everyone saying that this game is a bad port is coming from either. They're using modern textures and effects for this game, so of course its specs will be a tad steeper than the game you played 9 years ago.

Each and every time I attempt to adavance upon obtaining the wrench the game goes to hell. There was another time when the game swapped me to windowed mode without me choosing to do so, upon attempting to revert back to fullscreen the game crashes.

The short version of the story goes like this.  When the original Bioshock was released it had a host of bugs on PC and which ones affected you was a real grab bag.  That's to be expected with new games though, and like all landmark titles the majority of those bugs were fixed in time.  This remaster has somehow allowed all those bugs to resurface and cultivated new ones too. Worse yet there are certian fine tuning grapich and audio options stripped from the menus as well.  Issues can range from broken audio diaries, to hair brained lighting effects, program stuttering where there should be none, outright save deletion, and the game even refusing to launch in some cases.Bioshock is an amazing game and the original is still very playable.  This remaster however is a flat technical mess, and Bioshock deserves a much better remaster than this.Don't buy it unless it gets fixed."

The launch of the game was bad and while the latest patch fixed some of the major issues with it, the game still has very obvious bugs that haven`t been adressed at all. For now i`ll list what problems have been fixed so far in my playthrough. After that, i`ll list the issues i`ve found so far that haven`t been adressed. I`ll keep updating this review with the more problems I find as I go through the game.Fixes-We finally have a proper options menu. You can now adjust your FOV from 75-130.-Music in the intro is working-Death animations for splicers and objects reacting to getting hit now run at 60 fps, unlike the slideshows from the original Bioshock-Game settings don`t reset every time you launch the game anymore.Bugs so far-Certain lines repeat. For example, when you get the first plasmid and you hear two splicers talk over you. Their lines play but they get repeated, which overlaps with the Little Sister`s lines shortly afterwards. Another example being when Atlas talks about the sisters for the first time. After you watch the Big Daddy kill the splicer, his line about the big daddy repeats.-You HAVE to put on VSync. If you turn it off, the first scene with the spider splicer will be a mess of black blocks flashing in the screen. The game will also go insane once you take the elevator and reach the top. The textures will turn blurry and stretch all over the place.-Mouse sensitivity in second Little Sister scene. For some reason, when i lowered my weapons during this encounter, my sensitivity went up like crazy. I had to turn it down from 7 to 2 just to get a decent amount of control. After that scene was over, sensitivity went back to normal.-Oversized weapon models...? Not sure if this was intentional or just something that came with the patch (how ironic). I don`t remember the gun models being this huge before the patch so 2K might want to work on that.But hey, you never know. It took a few weeks after the announcement of a patch for it to actually roll out and even then they missed quite a few things. Hell, plenty of people are still reporting getting crashes every hour or so. Funnily enough, my copy of the original game never EVER crashed and yet it was with this ""remaster"" that it finally happened. I can only hope 2K rolls out another patch but this is a big publisher we`re talking about. May Rapture help us all. Now, i`ll leave you with one of my favourite quotes from the man himself, Andrew Ryan.I came to this place to build the impossible. You came to rob what you could never build - a Hun gaping at the gates of Rome. Even the air you breathe is sponged from my account. Well... breathe deep, so later you might remember the taste."

The remaster of the first BioShock put me in awe in the first 5 mins. Unfortunately, I was let down by utterly horrible cutscenes, poor mouse smoothing and a massive lack of customizability in the graphics settings.Let’s start with the graphics settings. Most titles that are released to focus on better graphics (such as almost any remaster) have extensive graphics settings to cater for all types of pcs and to satisfy all pc master race lords with the satisfaction of saying they can run on all ultra-settings, Bioshock did not live up to these standards. It had no texter quality settings, shader quality settings or shadow quality settings. None. I may make the settings sound minimal and that’s because they really are with the only settings there that I found at all necessary being the fov and AA settings. The fact that I was running at 140fps and couldn't do anything to improve the basic game quality had me kicking myself.The mouse smoothing was a basic issue that, as far as I can tell is due to a poorly done pc port. Not much more to be said on that, was just a bit of a peeve.I loved the BioShock series and I had played the original game all the way through 4 times and i figured the remaster would at least have enough charm to give the game the replay value that it had already. A huge part of a games immersion can come from the cetaceans and it can be a fine line between boring and captivating. Bioshock remastered cutscenes were simply hard to look at and I ended up quitting the game before the scene with the first little sister had finished as there we two thick back bars on the top and bottom of the screen taking up near 40% of the overall image and just to kick it in, I could pause and see the full image but could not remove these massive eye sores. This ruined the games replay value for me.Simply put, this game was ruined by 2 little bars and some missing settings and it kills me that all it to was those simple things to make me never want to play this wonderful game again.If anyone at 2K ever sees this please get those two bars fixed because that’s all it will take to make this game great again.Now as gor the reason for me actualy recomeneding this game, it is still a good game and for anyone who hasn't played the series before it is worth the money howeve rthey did not fix my main issues with the first gameP.S.  When I die I want 2k to lower me into my grave so the people who made my favourite games and ruined them can let me down one last timeP.P.S.

Rarely drops below 120 fps. Only bug I had was when I adjusted the mouse sensitivity, then the menus stopped responding and the notification icons got Xbox buttons on them instead. A restart resolved that. Loving the updated textures, many updated models as well, like the big daddies, splicers, crates, etc. Mouse sensitivity is fine for me on 2 and the game hasn't crashed yet, but the lack of graphical options is a downside. Especially the lack of a fov slider, which should go to 110 at least. I don't know what the current number is, but it hasn't improved a lot.

It will not remember my resolution choice and defaults to 4k for some reason, despite my monitor being 1080p. The visual upgrade is unimpressive with very minor and/or unnoticeable changes. Some textures have been sharpened here and there, with some small replacements of textures in some places. Even in side by side comparisons, it's not immediately obvious where the improvements are. Aside from the look, nothing has been changed to improve the game itself and it feels somewhat shoddy compared to the original. I've encountered many physics related problems with objects not reacting right and more commonly, everything in a room floating slowly in a certain direction. These could be tied to framerate and might be fixed by limiting it to 60. There's also some weirdness in the mouse. Sensitivity doesn't seem to be consistent and there is acceleration that can't be disabled without editing an INI file.This very much feels like a cheap cash grab. No real effort has been put in to improve the game and in many ways, has made the game worse. At least most people got this for free. If you're looking to buy Bioshock, do yourself a favor and buy the original. It's cheaper and it's an overall better game."

Not sure what all the complaints are about, they must be out of date. As far as poorly optimized, I would say that either those who are experiencing this are trying to play on a potato or have GPU card settings out of wack. For one Bioshock uses deferred lighting which usually has problems with forced AA methods via drivers. So if you have these enabled try disabling them. As far as poor performance. I haven't seen any and considering I'm playing it as I write this with a pretty performance intensive Custom ReShade preset made by yours truly(which turns the game into a visual marvel) and still get 90-120fps I doubt the issue is with BioShock.I would strongly suggest not using ingame AA especially if you are experiencing performance issues. Anyone who hasn't heard of ReShade, enlighten yourself on what it is and pick it up and start playing around with it and how it works. To break it down quickly ReShade is basically the jack of all trades shader library that can be applied to virtually any 3D game in existence. Some of the Shaders it utilizes written by a team of talented people rival ENB shaders developed for Skyrim(SSGI/Ambient Lighting and Adaptive Sharpening to name a few). The AA methods used in it are SMAA(vastly superior method than basically anything else with little to no performance hit) and FXAA(basically same as Nvidia's version with a few customization advantages and HQ4X shader(which really isn't AA but it massively downsamples an image and smooths it at low settings - which basically works amazingly well along side SMAA/FXAA).Another issue maybe lack of directx 9 binaries and libraries. Try downloading the June 2010 DX9c compilation and see if that alleviates issues. All in all this game is a real Gem and being remastered with better controller support for those who feel like playing the game on there widescreen TV across the room is just a win/win10/10"

I'm a huge fan of Bethesda games since Morrowind, so it's safe to say I have a huge tolerance for bugs and whatnot, but even this remastered version tested my patience. The enemies are jumpy (like what you'd experiece with slight lag on a multiplayer FPS), there were many game-breaking bugs/glitches, and worst of all there is a bug where there's a 20% chance that the game would crash when you save rendering the save deleted and kicking you out (making it more frustrating as you have to save a lot to make sure you haven't stumbled upon a game-breaking bug).

I thought it would be better and got really dragged by the achievements, inexistent on the original. However, I didn't get what I expected.The visuals are better, and also the problems with the mouse controls are fixed, but it is an extremely unstable program. During those couple of minutes that I played, I managed to get to Dr. Steinman, and went through the fight just well. When I pulled the lever to take me to the next site, the game crashed. Twice now, and the last time I had to forcefully restart my computer because it didn't allow anything else to come above it.In total, I got 3 crashes, and this last one kinda bummed me out from playing this copy. And I got lucky, some people with the same amount of play time got as many as 24 crashes, as far as I've read.Other pro-points are the bonus features that aren't in the original as well. The museum is very entertaining if you like Making Of stuff and I haven't heard any of the director's commentary but I'm sure they're good as well.The game needs a patch to stabilize it, and it needs it quick.Other problems I've noticed is small framedrops here and there and the rendering is odd, it will only render things in HD after some seconds when I'm really close or even only when I focus on it. Sometimes it won't even render, like the golden statue at the entrance, and it upset me a little because when I first played that statue is what hooked me. I connect to that statue.If crashes don't upset you [a lot] or you don't get them at all either because of a patch or you're lucky as heck, I'd say give this copy a try because of the achievements. But if you don't care for achievements or crashes are a no-go to you, I'd say stick to the original copy."

However, this ""remastered"" version is far from being remastered.  I don't think a single bug or glitch was fixed from the original released nine years ago.  And I'm talking glaring problems that have been well listed and well known.  The controls are still awful and require major tinkering to create an enjoyable experience.  Luckily, having owned and gone through this before with the original game, I was able to modify configuration files until the game wasn't annoying to control.  Now, I'm not sure how easy it is to fix those control issues, but it appears and feels as if no effort was even attempted.A simple bug I just recently encountered, however, I find almost impossible for whoever worked on the remaster to have had trouble fixing or impossible to not have known about.  On going through a playthrough I was carefully making sure I was aquiring all the audio diaries for the 'Historian' achievement.  Before leaving the area I carefully checked my list of audio diary messages and compared it to a guide of all the audio diaries.  One audio diary I knew I had picked up wasn't appearing in the list: the audio diary, Andrew Ryan - First Encounter.  I remember listening to this audio diary, but nevertheless went back to the spot to double check.  No audio diary was there confirming that I indeed picked it up.  A quick google search using ""radio diary not showing up in message first encounter bioshock"" popped up with many similar experiences.  First link I found gave me my answer... an answer from a post made seven years ago.  After picking up the audio diary, the diary appears in a different tab.  It appears in the Neptune's Bounty - Smuggler's Hideout section instead of the section for Arcadia - Farmer's Market.  To put it simply, it sounds like I'm still on track to (hopefully) finish the achievement.  A simple miscatagorization bug still haunting Bioshock into its ""Remastered"" version since its launch nine years ago.I've heard that some of the issues may be under review for a future patch, but its incredibly saddening that this version is bascially the same exact game.  Nothing about the game was attempted to create a ""remastered"" version.

I remembered how ♥♥♥♥ing awful it was to get through some of the fights on a controller. Anyways,I recently watched a video about Thief vs AAA games, which is a great watch for anyone that wants a deep, in depth look at the foundations of what makes a ""good"" game.So onward I go into Rapture, no tips, no marker, nothing but hard difficulty and what I remembered of the game, which is most of it. I noticed immediately the obvious complaint about the PC port and the controls of the game. But I'm surprised it got up everyone's♥♥♥♥♥so much. A lil adapting won't kill ya. (Also btw getting a PC port from a console port is a seriously extensive process and had that been the case none of you goons would have gotten this game for free). I got used to it, changed a DPI setting for the game, and ventured on. Clunky, but that's kind of what Bioshock feels like. It was refreshing to go through the story again, and not just in a grindy way but more of an appreciative way as it's been years since I've played this game. I honestly forgot on how incredible this games story is. When you are actually in Rapture and not arrow marker zombie mode it feels just like old times. Now, playing this on a GTX 1070 w/ 144hz was a walk in the park. The game itself rewards the player, similarly to Thief, for not only just going off road, but for trying to dive deeper into the story. At times of course it's frustrating to not have your 300fps tf2 super action movie gameplay, but again, it's really not that difficult.Remastered defintely isn't the right term. Mostly *updated Rapture. Beautiful textures, remodels, ect. (And even extra content! Directors film thingys and some side mission stuff, which is great.) But in the end you are replaying through Bioshock, you are not expecting anything different since this was given to fans with no cost, and for those who are new to the series can buy this *updated Rapture for a fair deal.

Though it is easy enough to get used to (especially by those who have played Bioshock before) it would be nice to see more player options available.Lastly, though it doesn't often happen, the game can and will crash. Though it was running for about 5 hours straight it can be annoying when you are 2 hours into a level and the game crashes, leaving you only with the autosave at the start of that level (as quicksaves won't remain).But overall, is it bad? No where near. The nostalgia remains from the original with a little bit of modern charm, the message and presentation is still thrilling, and the gameplay is still exciting (even after the massive gameplay improvements and functions found in the procedding two games).Add on the inclusion of achievments (something I had been wanting in Bioshock for years), the Orphan Gallery and new trials its still definetly a pick up if you havent already, or a play if you, like me, got it for free with your original version.TL:DR Has its issues and seems to be a bit of a lazy port, but still bloody fun and nostalgic with the improvements in graphics and add ons making it worth playing over the original."

Every jumpscare still makes me yank my head back from the monitor and I really enjoy every moment of it.About whole ""remastered"" things yeah this game more like re-textured into more HD quality and some or minor adjustment based on todays technology in graphics like lightning etc. If only 2K put some time and work for creating a different whole PC remastered version instead of console port version than I believe it will become much much more awesome, but hey at least its free and I cant argue with that..About bug and crash, almost 4 hours of playing it and I never found one, its all smooth gameplay for me. No stuttering, fps drop, low fps etc on my AMD FX-8350 +GTX980 PC. The only problem I encounter are when first time try to start the game its keep getting error message, turns out you just have to download some windows update and its done :DEDIT REVIEW:*Okay been 8 hours of playing now and I get some minor bugs like when I opened map ""M"" the selection tab move/change it self, it can be solved by saving your game and load it again.*On certain level I get two artefact on the water but only on that part and never encounter it again.*Settings keep change by itself, never happend to me before but last night when I'm in the middle of playing my house having a electricity off for a moment and when I turn on back my PC and playing it again all my settings are back into default.*Crash when change  vsync on/off when in the middle of the game. I got this one crash when trying changing vsync on/off. Have to ctrl+alt+del to close the program and when I start the game again my settings also back to default. But after that I trying to change vsync on/off again when in game the crash didn't happend. So for me its kind of random now.*Shotgun keep/stuck reloading. When my shotgun out of ammo and I reload it, it keeps do reload animation though the ammo are already max, 4 shell in this case, but it can be fix by change your weapon into something else and back to shotgun again.*There is kind of stutter/repeating dialog when playing the recording tape, but only found it once so far among dozens of recording I found."

The game has crashed twice in 45 minutes, there's lots of texture pop in, the options are severely lacking, you can't adjust mouse sensitivity without it turning on the controller (you can disable it afterwards but the fact it even turns on from simply changing sensitivity should tell you the quality of this port), the mouse feels heavy due to mouse acceleration which can only be turned off via config tweaks, your keybinds reset whenever the game crashes, the audio is terrible and overall it's really not much of an upgrade over the original."

It doesn't improve the graphic that much and doesn't resolve the problems related to the original game such as mouse sensitiveness, FOV view with some minor visual glitches and the very annoying problem of auto-switching the game difficulty setting everytime the game crashes or you manually change it in other savegames. To be sincere I don't even like the few new models and details added. An example are the amiss starfishes. Now there are a lot of colorful starfishes scattered all around the sea bed like there is not tomorrow. I found it quite odd and weird.Moreover the game crashes way more often than the original one but hopefully this issue will be resolved with a patch in the future (I really hope so).Pros are the V-sync now functioning, the addition of achievements, a new difficulty level, and some extra challanges separated from the base game storyline.To sum up we have the same game, less stable but with (little) improved graphic.The fact is that Bioshock is one, if not the best FPS the videogames industry has ever had. The story, the gameplay, the art direction and the atmosphere all together are mind blowing and unique. It's a masterpiece. So if you call yourself a ""real gamer"" you have to play this game if you haven't done it yet and in conclusion I must say that the achievements alone with the new textures are the main reasons why you should play this remastered version over the original one even if it's less stable."

This is definately the best way to play theI had high hopes for this, but I should have saw it coming when it was going to be released for free to owners of the originals. I was expecting mechancics to be ripped out of Bioshock Infinite, then plugged in here so that it wouldn't feel as dated, however thats not the case. As far as I can tell, it is 100% the same exact original game, just with a few graphical upgrades added.This means, a lot of the severly dated UI elements, controls, and sound effects, remain the same. Making it feel just a smudge more playable than the original. What they upgraded with the graphics even, isn't very extensive. I still find the Bioshock Infinite Burial at Sea DLC looks a lot better than this ""remaster"", and that came out years ago.Because this game hasn't improved at all from the original other than graphical improvements, you still have a bunch of old engine problems that should be fixed today. Notibly, quicksaves. For some reason, whenever you quicksave it boots you back into a loading screen and takes a couple seconds to save, which defeats the purpose of the feature at all. This game also has the worst screen tearing I've ever seen in my life, requiring me to play with V-Sync on. Every now and again there are also crashes, and with the quicksave feature being as broken as it is, this can be pretty detrimental and set you back hours.Another annoying thing is that all of my settings rarely save. Whenver I quit the game and have to restart, or it crashes and I have to restart, I always have to reset my display settings/keybinds. Which is incredibly annoying.tl;dr they didn't really remaster it at all.The game itself, however, is fantastic. Makes all of the pain worth it.As a side thought: If they didn't mislead us by calling it a remaster, and rather labeled it as a texture-upgrade, I feel like it would've done a ton better."

When it launched it was a pretty mediocre port job, to the point that it was arguably worse than the original game from what I hear. It's since been patched, but it's still got a bit of the plasmid blues. The graphics are upgraded, but from what I've been able to tell they've also been downgraded in some ways, primarily in the realm of water, fire, and other environmental effects. The audio mixing also seems to be suffering a bit. These aren't things that I noticed while playing, though; if you've never played Bioshock or just haven't played it in a long time, you probably won't ever notice. What you will notice, however, is that the game has a strong tendency to crash when doing anything menu-based, and the game loves to shuffle your plasmids and even weapons when you upgrade them, usually forcing you to edit the keybinds simply to get your plasmids to work with the right keys.I'm sure there are also other issues that I didn't personally experience, but overall it's still Bioshock, and even though Remastered still isn't perfect it's at least now a safer bet than getting the old original to work with the same functionality. I'm not enough of an authority on Bioshock to say which version you should play if it's your first time, but this version is at least playable now, so there's that."

Thanks to the team who worked on this remaster and provided it to Bioshock owners for free!I played through the original Bioshock a few times back after it originally released, first time on an AMD 4000+ with a 7900GS video card in 1024 x 768, then the second and third time on an Athlon x2 5600+ with an 8800GT with a 720P TV. Meeemooorieesss.... Wow--even then, I was blown away, and now I'm going through it again for the fourth time via this remaster on an i7 3770, 16GB of DDR3, and a GTX 960 2GB.So, yeah, there are a few little bugs. If people are getting crashes it is most likely due to something conflicting on their machines. I keep my machine pretty clean despite the fact that I am a power user and use my PC for music production, web design, programming, and office. I also am good with doing driver updates. Another factor that might cause crashing for some people but not me is the fact I have an external audio interface since I produce and DJ, so I don't use an onboard sound driver which in my years of PC tech experience most people NEVER remember to update drivers for.The only two bugs I've had: both bugs I had were during initial setup. 1: After changing cursor speed, my mouse wouldn't actuate any selections. Had to use arrows, Escape, and Enter to exit game and reboot. Once rebooted, I turned gamepad option OFF (default ON) and all was fine. Bug 2: It took me two times to select windowed resolution OFF from ON, but it stayed just fine. I booted the game three times and it made me select it the second boot (first boot was fullscreen second was windowed for whatever reason). Third boot was fine.I'm running at a smooth 150-300FPS at any given time on my 144hz monitor lol... textures don't look mindblowing but the game definitely looks better than the original now. Props and thanks to the team who put this remaster together because I'm sure it took more work than most of the complainers are giving them credit for. I've been playing through first two levels, about to finish Medical Pavilion with no errors or hiccups.If you haven't played Bioshock, you need to get this game. I've shown so many people the first 15 minutes of the game over the years and it captivates everyone. Gameplay is REALLY fun and the storyline is better than most FPS games of the last couple decades save Half-life. I personally rank it above Halo series for story, not Multiplayer fun though."

I started playing this after the December 20th 2016 patch, and there are still major issues.I am playing this on a Surface Pro 4, so a very underpowered machine for gaming, and therefore problems like slow hi-res texture and model loading were not much of a surprise. I can live with those issues, since they are intermittent. I suspect that they are a result of my low-end hardware interacting with a poorly optimised build (since others with much more powerful hardware are suffering from similar issues).What I can't live with is the game crashing whilst I'm saving and losing not only that save point, but also previous saves; this has affected autosaves and apparently manual saves, so I presume is a Cloud Sync issue. I have lost hours of progress and as a result I will be deleting this version of the game and I simply cannot recommend playing it whilst it is so unstable and progress can be lost so easily.I would highly recommend playing BioShock to anyone who hasn't, but would also say that they should be very cautious of the Remastered version.

I play on Survivor and in the original version the Big Daddies are a force not to mess with (although you want and need to). They are absolute beasts who will destroy you. In this remaster however my first Big Daddy encounter was the absolute worst. I had a hacked turret and decided to lead the hostile Big Daddy towards my turret. Once the Big Daddy got sight of it, it just didn't know who or what to attack. He just froze and couldn't decide who he wanted to attack, making him a very easy target. I never encountered something like this in the original, and the Big Daddies lose all their 'magic' in this remaster.In the 2nd level (Neptune) I used telekinesis and it just ♥♥♥♥ed up everything in sight. Planks floating in the air like crazy, objects floating in groups, just stuck in the air.This remaster takes the bugs from the original (which weren't that many) and just adds a whole lot more.I am still going to finish this, because achievements, but new players should play the original version instead. It captures the magic of Rapture much more than this.The only plus side about the remaster are the graphics, Rapture looks more amazing in this one."

On release the game constantly crashed and was unplayable. Now we’re a few patches down the line, things have improved but aren’t exactly living up to the concept of a Bioshock Remaster.My issues with the game can be boiled down to two main points. First, performance on the PC is poor for the supposed graphical enhancements on offer. The graphics are a little clearer and sharper compared to the original, but framerate suffers drastically and refuses to remain constant, especially during scripted events.The second issue is that there is very little “remastering” on display here. Other than the minor bump in graphic quality, the game retains all the bugbears of the original. They’re still using the same crazy, sometimes downright inane physics engine. Portable turrets are still annoying as hell, getting in the way whenever they possibly can. I swear the AI has actually gotten worse, it seems pretty dead on arrival here, NPCs doing the craziest of things such as just standing there whilst being shot at and constantly going back and fourth on themselves. Big Daddies also have this issue and still occasionally crash the game.Not only does this feel like a rushed port, but it feels like a rushed remaster, probably aimed to capitalize on the XBO and PS4 more than anything. If it wasn’t for the fact that I got this for free, I wouldn’t be playing it. Do not buy it. The original will no doubt run much better."

This is thought with diffrent problems witch you can see from the many reviews below.I will recommend you to google how to change the FOV, and how to disable the intros, witch are really annoying when playing the game. FOV is at 75 (i think), and i'm playing in 2K (2560x1440), 75 in fov is to low, so i have it around 110, witch works for me. If you play at 1920x1080 i would recommend you to set it to at least 90-100 depending on how far away from the screen you are.I have just comleted the game without to many problems; only one crash and only a few times where i had to go back to the config files (user.ini) to edit and fix the settings to how i wanted it. As for my own, i would reccomend this to anyone intrested to play out Kevin Levine and Irrational games master peace. This is truly one of gaming histories best stories, best acting, and everything is great about this game, except the ending boss fight. Even Kevin Levine don't like it.Enjoy!"

There's no difference in picture quality on or off.-Mouse control feels jerky.-Graphic settings present in the original release are missing in this remaster.-The 2K intro logo videos go on for waaay too long. Just let me skip them, I shouldn't be forced to watch them every single time I want to play.-New bug has been introduced with the uncapped physics (sometimes when things collide they shoot off randomly at a hundred miles per hour).Then the good:-The new texture work is pretty nice overall. Not everything seemed to have received equal treatment, but its all still a faithful improvement over the originals.-The changes to the lighting with contrast adjustments looks nice and enriches the moody atmosphere of Rapture.-Physics are uncapped unlike in the original release so there's no more jerky ragdolling.-The addition of a cut content museum and directors commentary is neat and welcomed. I always enjoy seeing behind the scenes stuff of my favorite games.-Engine improvements that make this game run a lot faster than the original release.-The addition of a new ""Survivor"" difficulty level. I always appreciate more difficulty levels.Things that would've been nice to have included in a remaster:-SSAO-More dynamic shadows from lighting-Holster weapon button--Rapture looks beautiful, let us explore it without a weapon constantly swinging onscreen."

I played from start to finish with none of the issues I keep reading about in the other reviews.  I noticed a graphical glitch maybe 2 or 3 times throughout my entire playthrough but nothing major.  I did have the issue of the on screen prompts showing xbox controller buttons, but one restart of the game permanently fixed the issue.  The FOV issue from the first game is gone.  I really didn't need a slider since the option to extend it was good enough for me.  No problems with the mouse controls either.  After fiddling with the sensitivity, all it took was a little getting used to and I was good to go.  I guess I noticed the graphical upgrade, though I always thought the game was already great looking.  It took me looking at some side by side comparisons online to really see the differences since it had been so long since I've played through.Beautiful game.  Great voice acting.  Great story.  Hard to complain about the little stuff when you get it for free.  If you didn't already own it, I would consider this a great way to introduce yourself to the franchise."

I have encountered freezes and audio bugs sometimes but, for the most part, the game runs very smoothly and is just as enjoyable than the first game (except the graphics, which aren't amazing but are still much better than the original).I honestly expected more from a ""Remaster"" but I would still recommend it to any fps/ horror fans, since this game still has that very special eerie atmosphere and story.Currently, to me, it is a 7.5/10. If bugs get fixed and more options are added for PC (FOV slider, turn off mouse acceleration, be able to play around with graphical settings...) this could easily become a game that replaces the original by far and becomes the best bioshock game yet (or as good as bioshock infinite).If you are looking to buy this game (like, actually purchase it for 20 euro), I would recommend you wait for 2k games to release a patch of some sort. If you got the game for free like I did for buying the original, definitely attempt to play it (might work just fine for you)."

Though I do wish that there was a little more story to this part of the game, but there are other parts after this game, so maybe it isn't too bad.The graphics are pretty well done, and the scenery is very nice on the eyes too.While the character design is very unique and carry their own weight as well.I definitely won't be forgetting this game and it's characters.Now for the bad...The one thing that drove me nuts was, that the game kept crashing throughout the entire time I played it. Safe to say, I had to constantly save as I continued; otherwise, I would have never made it past the first stage. I lost about a good 5 or 6 hours of game play because it wasn't saving at first either. I know my computer can handle this game with ease, because it can run GTA V on max settings without an issue, so I know it isn't my computer. (it could be the setup though). But, if this game hadn't caught my interest, I would have just uninstalled all three games and never touched them again.But despite all of the crashing I had to deal with, I can say I am glad I didn't just stop playing it altogether.So if you find yourself in a gloomy mood or even in gloomy weather and like a steam punk type feel to your games, this game is worth the checking out.

Dont get me wrong, I am P***ED that you have only a few graphics options. AND I can tell not much effort was put into making the game feel smoother. I am a HUGE fan of this game, and kinda enjoy 2, and really enjoy Infinite. Overall I can understand why this has so many negative reviews, 2k gave the finger to PC users and made a lame port. I don't care what you read, it ABSOLUTELY looks better. Mainly in three ways. The first being all animations are now rendered at 60fps. Meaning when a splicer's lifeless corpse hits the ground after you smack him with your wrench, he doesnt look like he's stuttering. The second, and most underwhelming, is the lighting. Honestly, the lighting is hardly different from the original. BUT, the volumetric rays have been vastly improved. and no, this is not something to get really excited about, but I am noting it because it is an upgrade. Lastly and most impressively, is the textures. I am still drooling over the shotgun and admiring the wrench, with the (EXTREMELY LIMITED) settings maxed out, it is hard to see any textures that are displeasing to me. You can find them, but you have to look for it. Playing the game normally, I dont think you will notice. To be honest, I would buy the original BioShock for twenty dollars, and this game is an improvement. Please dont dislike this because you are salty about 2k giving us a s**tty port. Because I am too. But you guys put up with all of this for the original game, which is no different now except this one looks better. So if you got a free upgrade, it can't be worse.

As most poeple have stated, alot of the original bugs exist but it is what it is.  One thing I noticed is the resolution support went down - my native is 2560x1080 which is ultra-wide and the original Bioshock did support this, but this version does not.  Unfortunately resolution is probably the most important graphic configuration so it sucks that I can't play as beautiful as it really could be, but again it's a free upgrade."

In some ways this is fine (we don't really need a feature to toggle Directx 10 features anymore), but in some ways it is bizarre. Anti-Aliasing is just an on/off affair. As some people have noted, you can't set a specifice field of view. I think the default is fine, but I do know some people need to change it to wider angles for motion sickness.WITH THAT SAID, this is the definitive Bioshock. This version fixes several graphical issues I had with the original. The original had horrible texture pop-in, while this one doesn't. The rendering in general feels improved, as the original game had several moments where it felt like the whole thing was smeared in Vaseline. This version is crisp and detailed and stiff isn't over-shiny anymore. While the texture improvements are subtle, they add up and the game looks much nicer on the whole. This isn't utilizing every insane 2016 graphics technique, but it doesn't really need to. They took the time to lovingly improve the game's look while steel feeling true to the original Bioshock.I also really like the bonus features. The museum is really cool to walk around and lets you see some beta models.The challenge rooms are really creative and force you to think about the game's mechanics in unique waysSome people seem to be having mouse issues, but the mouse felt fine to me. Everything was responsive and smooth, but apparantly your mileage may vary.Overall, you probably have this game already, so check it out!

Basically what this means is that you'll have to muck around in the ini files a bit to get proper mouse control and FOV.Despite the original release receiving a patch to address some of the issues, Bioshock 1 on PC has pretty much always required manual modification to be playable. Frankly, it's extremely disappointing that the developers didn't fix the mechanical issues of such a landmark game - but the good news is that you can easily find 10 years worth of support threads to fix these issues relatively quickly.The positive side of this release is that the graphical upgrades, though minor, do make an appreciable difference. Most textures look crisper, the character models look much better, the lighting is improved, and the contrast and saturation looks to have been cranked up. Best of all, the upgrade removed the gross ""glossy"" look that affected half the objects in the original game. The director commentary reels are great.Overall, this is an excellent oppurtunity to experience the game again - provided you're willing to put in some work tinkering with configuration files."

One moment I'm blasting along at almost 600 FPS (no thats not a typo) the next I'm down to 30 FPS, then back up to over 200 FPS.  Wash, rinse, repeat.  No obvious pattern, VERY irritating.The mouse smoothing - ignoring the manual INI file changes (really?) - when loading a level/area the mouse movements are VERY slow and unresponsive, then they seem to ""bounce"" back to normal after 5-10 seconds.  There are some serious aliasing and texture popping issues - and make sure you enable frame limiting (nVidia/AMD config) or the game looks like it's going hard core rave with lighting issues!Thankfully I've not had any crashes...yet.One good thing though, the original gave me no sound from Windows 8.1 onwards - at least I get sound now.All in all, a very poor effort.

When I heard about the remastered versions I let out an annoyed sigh but was happy to see at the very least you dont have to buy it again if you already own the games so I cant complain about paying money for graphics. Upon launching the game I noticed why everyone has been complaining about the graphics options, they are very limiting, to the point that im playing on a lower resolution in windowed mode as to avoid needless problems. So far its a treat revisiting my favorite underwater dystopia and really look forward to meeting some of my all time favorite characters in video games and mow down splicers one last time in a great extravaganza. However I do have one huge gripe with the game outside of the graphics options.In the game, hacking is a decently essential tool in your arsenal. Having access to certain defences, unlocking safes with valuable resources and even getting a better price on your favorite ammunition can be crucial in winning on the harder difficulties with ease. I was just hacking in the game and the entrance tunnel that I had to connect with the exit tunnel in order to successfully hack was litterally blocked on every single side with an alarm node that would have not only electrocuted me and failed the hack but would send machine gun toting security bots to shoot me to ribbons. When I say all sides were covered I mean there was a 0% chance of successfully completing the hack because there was no where for the liquid to go, on every single side it would have hit a dead end, and those tiles cant be moved so it was either failing the hack or hitting one of them and getting dicked over just for wanting to open a safe. This issue should have been fixed when the game first came out because it has done this since the games release, before any sequels were made and before a remastered edition was probably even conceived. But hasent been fixed and I am pretty agitated over it. Please fix this in a future update especially if you want your fans to go back to these games and pay extra for a graphical overhaul if you used to play on consoles and dont have a pc version like many of my friends had to do.EDIT: it does not say it but I got this for free, just wanted to point that out because I must have missed that little check box. Thats my mistake, sorry for that.

The frame rate was increased, but otherwise there were only very minor graphical updates that I could see (mostly in the areas where you can see the underwater sections thru windows, etc).  Otherwise, nothing jumped out at me as an ""oh wow, that looks better"", etc.  There seemed to be an improvement with the Tommy Gun sounds no longer dropping out, but the other bugs and whatnot that people have reported are still there, intact.I've never really found the combat in any Bioshock game to be very satisfying, and I've since replayed them more for the scenery than anything else.  There's usually too much crap going on at once, and there is always smoke or some other thing that seems to be right in my field of view.  All of the enemies are basically bullet sponges that require no real stealth or strategy, and after playing so many games since Bioshock where I can mele at will, having to change to the wrench for that while Splicers clobber me is just plain tedious.All the weapons kind of suck, and I really get no pleasure out of using any one of them, even with the upgrades throughout the game.  While originally a neat idea years ago, the plasmids feel rather meh to me now, and I found in this version your crosshair has to be dead on in order to have any of the plamids make any contact with the enemies. I was hoping for some minor improvements in all of these areas, but sadly there were none.The bonuses in the game with the commentary were really not that interesting to me. I only watched one and can't say it held my interest long enough to want to see the rest.  Same goes for the museum.  I would recommend them only for the diehard fans.As for the tech side, I only had two minor graphical issues with water in one location and one CTD, but otherwise no tech issues to report.  Other users have not been so lucky, it seems.  I never bothered with the .ini file, but I really wish there were more graphical options, especially the ability to increase the FOV - it really felt claustrophobic.In the end, there's really no point to the update and I am not sure why the designers even bothered.  I definitely can't complain about the price, but I would have gladly paid $5-10 or so if there were serious improvements and updates done to the game.I never really expected much from the update, but I still somehow was hoping it would be better.Someone should have deep sixed the idea of this remaster and just left Bioshock alone."

,Recommended,409710,32638144,Posted: 22 June,all,MostUnorthodox,"**I recieved this game free due to already having the original Bioshock in my library. This review focuses mainly on the core game and not the remaster.**I was absolutely blown away with the remaster. The details added are fairly small, but they make a big impact on the atmosphere of the game. Absolutely gorgeous. I don't recall any crashes in my time with this game but YMMV. Be advised if you plan to purchase this version.ON TO THE GAMEBioshock is a wonderful game. Rapture as a setting is second to none in my opinion, and it was executed flawlessly. The scares are largely subtle, and that will ensure you're kept on your toes for the duration of your stay under the sea. Please do it justice and turn the lighting down to where the game recommends, it's suggested for a reason.There is a caveat. In my opinion, Bioshock isn't a full-on horror game. Certainly you're going to be anxious while playing due to the atmosphere and what can seem like neverending waves of enemies, but in terms of horror it pales in comparison to the likes of the Amnesia series.Combat can only be described as ""Ludacrisly fun"". Everything has weight to it. The powers in the game (known as Plasmids) all bring something useful to the table. In my mind none of them are useless. For sure you're going to end up defaulting to a couple, but mixing it up and trying something else isn't a handicap like it is in a lot of games. Ammo is scarce in Rapture, and you'll always be fighting to keep a decent supply going. You'll end up using weapons you never would have looked at before just to stay alive. This adds another layer to the survivalist-horror type affair.Bioshock does have a few downsides to it, however. ADAM (a currency in the game) seems far to common if you're going down the good ending route. By the end of the game in my last playthrough, I was sitting on around 7-800 spare with nothing to spend it on. Don't get me wrong, in the early game you're going to have near nothing, but mid-to-late game you're swimming in it.The crafting in the game seems unnecessary to say the least. It's critical in a single mission and (iirc) you never have to use it again. You'll pick up various components from around the city and can craft ammo and the two types of health kits used in the game.Overall, Bioshock is an absolutely wonderful game. If you can afford it I wholeheartedly recommend it. Everyone should play it at least once, if nothing else for the stellar atmosphere and worldbuilding."

I was able to get to play some of the additional content which are like mini missions and puzzles, but my game was so laggy and stuttered every 5 - 7 seconds, I would get a few good seconds of smooth gameplay at about 32 fps, but then it freezes for about 2-4 seconds. All the reviews that do not recommend it because of glitches are right, and I falied to heed their warning. They announced a patch in december of 2016 to fix everything, but the game remains unplayable for many people even after the major update. (yes I tried to optimize the game for my PC) Very disappointed, getting a refund right after this review."

It will reset all settings to default,INCLUDING DIFFICULTY AND GAMEPLAY SETTINGS. Was playing on the ""Survival"" difficulty only to realize nearly 50% through the story mode, my difficulty went to Normal.The most infuriating part about the game is I sank about 5-6 hours into the actual story-mode, and it's crashed on me 3 different times in 3 zones(Neptune's Bounty, Arcadia, Olympus Heights) forcing me to start EACH ZONE from scratch, all of which are over an hour long at Maximum speed pace with full loot clears.I now have 11 hours and am at the scene where you meet the primary antagonist for the first time and he GLITCHES BEHIND A DOOR. Shortly after Tenenbaum tells me to chase the ""idiot"" he is behind a scripted event door where he is in an infinite loop.I now have to start the entire game over from scratch, all because of this glitch. I start a new game and it immediately crashes.To make things even worse, the ""Developer Reel"" easter eggs in the game, DIDN'T EVEN SAVE IN THE EXTRAS. I spent the entire time looking for all the reels to watch in the extras for it to not even save them when the game crashes.Frustrated with that fact, I launch Bioshock 2 to get-over my problems only for it to crash 40 minutes in.I can't recommend this game to anyone in its current state.

I do enjoy the updated graphics though. Makes it look a little bit clearer, but I also wish they had done some more on character models to make them look a bit more refined. Either way, it's a good game, but if you were going to be a first time player on the game, I recommend waiting until it goes on sale.For anyone who is new to the series, Bioshock itself is amazing. The story elements and when this game was made, it was very well made and this is the kind of game that will always be very near and dear in my heart. It's a classic, you can't deny that. Definitely a game you have to play sometime in your gaming life. What I like about this remastered version is that you get to listen to the director's thoughts as they were making this game and see some pretty neat concept art for the game. And also, you get the DLCs that were originally only available to console AND you now get achievments, which in the original PC version, you did not previously get. So something to strive for if you are a completionist of a sort.Point of this whole review is, Bioshock is amazing, this version is not as bad as everyone and their mother is saying it is, and you should wait when it goes ons sale, but I won't judge if you are eager to play this game and say ""screw waiting for it to be on sale!"""

I had no crashes at all running it on Windows 7, HW Spec - EVGA GTX 1080 FTW, 16gb 1600mhz ram, CPU i7 3820 3.6Ghz.This remaster is beautiful with now smooth mouse movements vs its old jagged mouse cursor movement, various updated textures and that is pretty much it. All it really did was make the game much prettier and easier to play and aim with smoother cursor movement especially.It was a beautiful experience to play again though I always disliked how linear the game felt near the end. I always wanted to back-track and explore rapture more, if only it was more open like that with side quests, being able to move around different sectors and such. Either way this is a classic game and its more beautiful then ever.As for you guys in windows 10. Seriously. Windows 10 is the most horrible unstable version of windows I have ever seen and is most certainly not recommended for gaming. Windows 8.1 is not so hot either As I have a windows 8.1 gaming laptop that not only crashes games but it sometimes bluscreens as well.

The setting, the story, the immersion, the art design, it is all very good. I never played the original so for me this is first run and I am having lots of fun.BUT...This game is a technical embarrassment. I have tried playing it before the patch and it was simply unplayable. Now, after the patch, it is mostly playable but the problem is, it crashes at some really weird times. Sometimes it crashes when I am trying to open a map, and sometimes it crashes when I am trying to overwrite a save. I save a lot and switch between two save files so if it crashes I don't loose a lot of progress but it is annoying.I just can't understand how can a developer release a game that runs pretty smooth for the most part and then have it crash when a player tries to save or open a map, I mean, open a freakin map. Pause the game, open a static menu. What can possibly crash there? And they couldn't fix it with the patch? Embarrassing! Shame on the developer to put so much hard work for making such a wonderful experience and then just crapping all over it with such a minor, stupid annoyance."

When I hear a game has been remastered, I assume that it has been improved, not made worse than the original. I honestly don't know who was in charge of quality control for this, but they ♥♥♥♥ed up BIG.Pros:- Graphics DO actually look better (well 95% of the time).Backgrounds seem to be more fleshed out, more detail added and textures look a lot smoother. Game play is fine and the combat is good.Cons:- Mobile Game level options menu.Comparing this options menu with the original is no contest. The remastered edition is missing almost EVERY single major graphics option. How arrogant is it of the developer to think that just because this is an ""improved"" and remastered version of the game that I wouldn't want to mess with my graphics options for performance. A game coming out in 2016, even if it is a Remaster of an older game is not allowed to release with such a♥♥♥♥♥♥options menu.- Crashes EVERYWHERE.Do you enjoy crashes? Well, if you do then you'll love this game. If you're like me and don't like it when a game crashes, corrupting and deleting your save file and forcing you to redo whole levels from the start then I would say stay away. This game will crash while you are saving and delete the save file you're saving over. Now its not ALL the time, but its happened to me about 3 times during my play through, forcing me to sometimes redo entire levels from the very start.Final Verdict:DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION!!! Do not get this until AT LEAST the crashing issue is fixed, but seeing as its been almost a year since the release of this version and they're STILL there, I wouldn't count on it. The fact that this game was allowed to be sold to the public in this state is appalling."

I had been meaning to play it again for ages so when this remastered version appeared in my Steam library I had to play it.To my delight this game is every bit as good as I remember it. The crumbling art deco underwater city is still as exciting to explore a second time. The combat, with its combination weapons and special powers and upgrades is great.Having not played the original for many years it is difficult to make a direct comparison but it looks pretty much how I remember it. The obvious differences are this version has trading cards, achievements, a little museum and directors commentary videos. I liked the achievements as they made me go and find aspects of the game which I missed the first time such as collecting all the audio diaries. I watched the first of the directors commentary videos but I wasn’t too interested so didn’t bother with the rest.A lot of other reviews mention technical problems but I played through the game without any issues at all.So you should definitely play one version of this game either this or the original. If you don’t have any technical issues then the minor tweaks to this version make it the better choice but they are not that significant if you are having problems."

It's just a very slight enhancement. The game does run worse, too. Bioshock Remastered gets a 2/10. This is like repainting a portion of your back deck, then calling the entire house remodeled. The amount of work done in this remaster is disturbingly small.My main reason for rating this poorly is becuase this is not technically a remaster, but it is labeled as such. That is a very deceptive move.Blind Squirrel Entertainment remastered this game with 2k, which I think is the main issue here. Why couldn't 2K do it by themselves? Blind Squirrel is like a assistant developer, who assists big names devs in making their games. As I stated above: the main issue is that this Bioshock Remastered title is not a remastered version of Bioshock. All Blind Squirrel did was update the visuals in some of the menus and in-game interfaces. That's it. The game looks and sounds EXACTLY like the origional. But in addition, I experience more physics glitches in this remastered version. Thankfully, it runs at 120fps, which is a plus. But the lack of respectable graphics options kinda of kills the joy of a high frame rate.I have experienced some game crashing while attempting to save, and during a few intense firefights with a large number of enemies. The crashing while saving is very annoying. It's important to manually save often in this game to avoid frustration. If the game crashing during a save, you can just reload the previous one. However if you rarely save, it'll start you at at the begenning of the level your on if the game crashes. Imagine that happening if you're at the end of a level. This happened to me.This should not be called a remaster when nothing but in-game interfaces were actaully upgraded. They didn't even improve the sound effects either. Yes, there are bonus features but what's importat here is that the main game has not been remastered, when it is labeled as such."

The remaster dosen't look all that better than the original, but it does add a little something to the usual level of graphics. The game play is great and the execution is top notch.The problem is that the game crashes - a lot. When I change plasmids in The Medical Pavillion, boom, it's gone. Helpfully, it also corrupts my save game, so I've played through the Pavillion three times and after that I came to the conclusion that nobody has time for this crap.

And still dose it after I turn off that I use controller.I can't turn off Auto Aim. I know there is an option for that in the settings but i don't change anything.And there is no graphic settings at all. Only resolution and AA. But the good think about there is not many option is that I don’t remember them after a game restart. I have to change the settings every time I start the game for same reason and also the key bindings.The mouse sensitivity is for some reason really, really low the first 30-60sec every time you load the game or go to new place where it have to load.Also the games crashes a lot for me. And for some reason if the game crashes you also looses the quick save files. Last save i had was an Auto save from start of a map and all my quick save was gone after a game crash.All in all, this has destroyed all the good thinks I remembered about the Bioshock.

Only smoke and brightness where the fire would be. I'm having this issue anyways I dont know if anyone else is. Majority of the game is very nice however.

,Not Recommended,409710,28800997,"Posted: 29 December, 2016",all,Semicomatose,I've been (thankfully) unaffected by the technical issues that others have had problems with but this is still a really dissapointing attempt at remastering such a fantastic game. It is only subtley different visually from the original and offers few visual improvements. For every nicely up-rezzed texture there's another new piece of art with a weird seam or odd specular map. But what I cannot forgive is the audio. All sorts of sounds and pieces of dialogue are way too quiet or way too loud. The ambient audio of the environment is much more flat than it was in the original version of the game and tons of sounds seem to be operating at a rather low bitrate. They're distorted and clippy. Audio logs will stutter and many are missing the record pops and scratches from the original version. If you're planning on playing Bioshock with headphones you should really stick to the original if you can manage it.A game this good and historically significant needs a remaster done with the appropriate care or no remaster at all. This is a pretty glaring missed oportunity by 2K to do something wonderful.

There is no excuse for a ten-year-old game to have problems like crashes and bugs upon re-release. I am glad they released a patch to fix things and it did get rid of the worst of the mess. But I still had problems with muddy textures and annoying glitches with the lighting even with the patch. I even had one point where a scripted event did not happen and I ended up stuck in a room until I loaded a save. I don't understand why a decade old game has these kinds of problems. Unacceptable.That being said, the game is classic for a reason. I'll be honest, it's difficult for me to be objective because this game holds a special place in my heart. This was the first game I ever played in my life. I have a pair of rose-tinted nostalgia goggles superglued to my face. So I may or may not be able to be totally objective. If you don't want to read to the end, here's the tl;dr... The game is still good. Play it if you haven't already. The bugs are still unacceptable.It's not a perfect game but it is damn close.The story is the reason why you are here. It is well told, thought provoking, and interesting. That's all I'm going to say about the story. It's better to uncover the twists for yourself (if it already hasn't been spoiled for you already). The gameplay is good if a bit clunky. You have a real sense of accomplishment when you take down your first Big Daddy. Those fights never get stale. Ever. They remain tense and fast-paced as you adapt your techniques with new plasmids and weapons. Definitely a highlight. However, there is a stiff difficulty curve in the last third of the game. It's a bit frustrating.The game is beautiful. There is a sense of wonder when you first sail into Rapture and start wandering around. I spent absurd amounts of time absorbing the details of Rapture. And I'll say that while the remaster added a layer of polish, the original game held up quite well over ten years. Even before the remaster, it looked pretty good for its age. If you decide to play the original over this one, I wouldn't blame you at all. It's very good.I'll say now what I said before: play it. It's a generally good game, despite the fact that on release it was buggier than a termite mound. If that bothers you, buy the original and play that. Like I said, the game has held up remarkably well.(And I want all the bonus points for not making a single reference to ""would you kindly"" in this entire review!)"

Overall it feels very half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in terms of a remaster, a lot of effects look bad like waterfalls seemingly dripping out of nowhere, the lightshafts that don't even closely match the actual lighting. And they stayed true to the original by keeping in all of its issues as well. The mouse speed is way too high with non-optional acceleration, and the FoV is painfully low (both of which can be fixed with jenky config file tweaks). As a remaster is feels very underwhelming and could've been so much better if they had redone the game completely in Unreal 4 where they could've leveraged some of the better lighting tech and actual changed levels slightly to avoid choppy looking effects and made them play a little better, I would've paid 60$ for that.

Most frustrating regarding saves is there's no longer a prompt to save when you exit the game.  I lost a few hours of gameplay after exiting to windows, which was exacerbated by the before mentioned save change changes.  I don't know if these are unique to my game vs others.  I've noticed some inconsistancy between players and the bugs/changes they're experiencing.Another thing, that maybe I just didn't notice before, is self injury via Plasmids.  Granted this is something I could have overlooked from the original, but I want to say that, for example, if you electrocuted splicers in water you could immediately go in to loot where as now you electrocute yourself.  This doesn't take away from the gameplay though, instead just makes you play smarter - or rather more realistically.Still a great game 5/7 rating overall."

Thequicksaveloading screen is too long to be called aquicksavewhich kind of defeats the purpose.I am a huge fan of the Bioshock franchise, and especially Bioshock one in particular, it was the original that innovated my addiction for the series. The game itself appeared aesthetically pleasing however it lacked a few of the elements of a ""true remaster"" which I'd expect from a title like this. In all honesty I was actually quite disappointed that it only received a graphical face-lift. However, the developers did account for some extra play-ability including bonus features; The Making of Bioshock documentary and a few bonus challenge levels.Despite all of the frustrating issues the game is still worth revisiting, but only if you can hold it out.Note - there is a work-around you can do to solve the whole difficulty setting issue; navigate to your AppData\Roaming\BioshockHD\Bioshock folder, make a backup of the Bioshock.ini file (just in case), then open it up in notepad and add the following text under the big block of settings after ""[Perobjectconfig]"":[ShockGame.ShockUserSettings]GameDifficulty=GD_EXTREMENoVitaChamber=TrueIf you already have a section for ""[ShockGame.ShockUserSettings]"", then just add/ change the values. What it should do is set the difficulty to survivor mode (GD_EXTREME) and turn of vita chambers every time the game is started up. You might be able to do the same with graphics, audio and game control settings, but I haven't tried so not sure. As for the crashing and losing saves, the only advice I can give is to save and close the game down after getting past difficult areas. Can't guarantee that it works though."

A great story, if a tad predictable, You're Jack, a mysterious everyman stranded in the undersea city of Rapture. You discover both the wonders and terrors of this sub-sea paradise-turned-hell, complete with freaks, splicers, and terrorists. The weapons at your disposal include various firearms, a wrench, and Plasmids. These will become your best friends, as you will soon learn. There's a series of enemies you will grow to fear, though I won't say much beyond that.There have been various bugs and crashes reported with these remastered versions, though to be honest I never had many problems with either game beyond some crashes (no more than 5-6, if I remember correctly). They may take some tweaking though, but it's worth it. The overall look and feel of the game is much improved. The lighting, reflections, textures, and so on have been improved and upscaled. The game is now playable in 4K resolution, too.All I gotta say, though, is you should play this game."

I must be the luckiest guy on steam, because I've experienced none of the crashing that others have reported.While I can swear the art direction is somewhat different from the original, it actually adds rather than detracts. Rapture feels more full and complete. Floor and ceiling textures show age and wear and there are more buildings and signs . Overall, it feels like a more belieavable version of a city under the sea -- more true to the creator's original vision. As an added bonus, nearly all of the ""loading screens"" have been eliminated and movement between levels and areas feels more natural and less disjointed.If you haven't played Bioshock before, I implore you to pick up the remasters. The game holds up really well despite its age. If it's been a while since your last romp through Rapture, you should definitely check out the great work that Blind Squirrel put into the remaster.The only real shame here is that 2K spent time and money restoring an old game instead of investing in a new Bioshock."

Proper support for Steam controllers (a developer recommended config), too. Otherwise they've left it exactly as it is, which is exactly what they should have done.After playing through to the medical centre with this version, I went back and played the original PC release of Bioshock and that's when I realised how nice this new version is.

I begrudgingly gave HalfLife a positive review.  Maybe that was because I'm scared Valve will cancel my steam account or something to be petty.  Bioshock gets no such leeway.  I expect downvotes from writing this.  Oh well.It just wasn't that good.  I mean, there's nothing wrong with the game from a functional standpoint.  It had some neat ideas.  So it really had to work hard for this downvote.  That's commendable, I guess.It's possible this remastered version made me more critical.  I got kinda annoyed finding ""film scrolls"" everywhere with director commentary and what not.  Let's do the good/bad thing.The good:-Everything functionally about the game is top notch.  I even found myself incredbily impressed with how nice the enivronmental damage decals looked.  You can hit ANYTHING in this game and it will leave a very convincing mark.  So props to the poor guy who got that meticulous work.-World building is pretty good-Plasmids give some variety to what would otherwise be an INCREDIBLY dull shooter as opposed to a very dull shooter.The bad:-The story did not do it for me, but I seem to be a minority.  The big twist might have meant more if I knew ANYTHING about my character up til that point.  As is, the game felt way to excited about it.-I thought about saying the vita-chambers take away any stakes but for one, they can be turned off, and two, if this game dragged itself out any longer I wouldn't have finished it.-SPEAKING OF DRAGGING OUT!  This might be my biggest complaint about this game.  EVERY STUPID LIL THING YOU DO IN THIS GAME IS DRAGGED OUT BY HAVING TO DO SOMETHING ELSE BEFORE YOU CAN DO IT.  I was so sick of gathering 3 of somethings.  This is the opposite of fun gameplay!  This is repetitive busy work.  You have to do a mission where you have to ""smell like a big daddy"" and the lady on the radio is like ""You'll need three pheromones to smell like one!  Because reasons!""  One bottle of axe body spray will make you stink for days, but I need 3 bottles of this plot device to do the same job?  Also this was only a small part of some other busy work.  It was needing 3 of something as a part of 3 of something.  It's not a short game... Why all the padding?-Hacking.-An escort mission towards the end spent with your view narrowed because it's inside a helmet that gets interrupted every 3 seconds by HACKING.  They added layers and layers of awful to a notoriously awful video game mission type.If anyone made it to the end of this, will you comment and tell me why I should bother playing Bioshock: Infinite?  Bioshock 2 isn't happenning.  People who like Bioshock seem to hate that game."

Bioshock 1 is a fantastic but somehow dated game and this update is more of a retexture than anything else. The game runs smoothly at 144fps on my 5 year old PC and many objects and enviroments look notably better. It's a bummer that the issues with the original version aren't fixed, but those issues were never throwing me off enough to not enjoy the games while playing either of the versions.I recommend playing through Bioshock again if you enjoyed it the first time around (or haven't tried it yet. You really should, it's an awesome game), just be prepared that some aspects of the game are dated and broken, most noteably the weird mouse acceleration and sensitivity bugs, despite this being a remaster/re-release."

The remaster is great for a game that is so old because the old versions were so badly incompatible with Windows 7 that it put me off from playing it further.My biggest issues with the old versions were :-The wonky mouse controls-Physics being capped to 30FPS-The constant CTD(crash-to-desktop) that happened randomly across the playthroughsWith the remaster, they fixed the physics cap and the game is not crashing for me. The mouse however is still wonky as hell and if you don't have the software/hardware that can counter the effects, I'm afraid you won't have that much fun with the mouse flying across the screen like crazy.I personally did the INI setting for the mouse to disable the acceleration. I then put the in-game sensitivity to 2 and lowered my DPI via the mouse buttons on my Logitech G502 Proteus Core. Now the mouse is smooth and slow as it should be.Overall, the game is great and I'm quite happy to finally be able to experience Bioshock 1 and 2. A lot of people have issues on Windows 10 however. I personally don't use that crap of a system, it's awful.My specs are listed under my profile if anyone is interested on what to expect for it to run well. I am running the game with everything maxed out, no FPS drops, no crashes. 1920x1080 on Windows 7 Ultimate x64 with no issues.Is the Remaster worth buying ? I don't know, depends how much you love Bioshock. I luckily bought both games (with DLC) for just 5$ during Steam sale. And it's not like the developers were hiding the offer (buy the old games, get the new ones). There were months of announcements about the Remastered version being free, so buying one now seems silly."

The remastered version has better graphics, as well as  a musem of concept art and hidden directors commentary to unlock, yet they could've added more to the actual game play like an extra level.My main concern is that my game likes to crash during saves, and then delete saves (For example, I've been stuck replaying the same 20 minutes of game play for the past 5 times in the medical pavilion and the game deleted it all when I was halfway through!). This makes it unplayable after a while."

,Recommended,409710,30502115,Posted: 13 March,all,Donkin Cronkin',"Bioshock is undoubtably one of the greatest games ever made. It features level design that encourages exploration, a rich story in audio logs, unique gameplay options with plasmids, and an unforgettable setting. The combat feels great with hundreds of strategies to employ. It works well for someone who just wants to shoot things, and works even better for those with creativity and an awareness of their surroundings. It's hard not to be impressed by the philosophical nature of the game. Hours after finishing it I'm still questioning if man is ""entitled to the sweat of his own brow"" or if humanity is really is as free as it claims to be. You've probably heard all kinds of atrocious things about the remaster, and there are certainly some issues. In my 10 hour playthrough of the game I had 1 crash and 4 freezes, and two of which saw me lose about 20 minutes of progress. The freezes all happened while attempting to access the map/objective screen. To regain control of my computer during a freeze, I'd have to hit CTRL+ALT+DEL, sign out, and log back in. Although frustrating, I don't think the issues should keep you from making a purchase. I have reason to believe 2K is going to roll out more patches, and the crashes weren't as bothersome as you'd think. A few bumps in the road aren't nearly enough to justify a pass on this gem of a game. The immersion, fluidity, and rich story are all something you really don't want to miss out on.Sidenotes: This review is based on my second playthrough of the game, as I originally played it on the 360.To minimize frequency and impact of crashes: don't overwrite autosaves and save often"

I would recommend it to everyone who likes and plays first person shooters and horror themed games but this time I will not.The problem is that the frequent CRASHING deletes my save and game configurations. One time I was playing for a good hour or so and progressed to the story very well until I saved my game manually and suddenly *boom* black screen and a window popped up ""BioShock is not responding"". I said to myself, ""Hey, it happens. I'll just launch the game again."" After launching the game again, It went to the main menu and I clicked continue. It loaded the very first stage (plane crash). ""Hey maybe it didn't load the right save."" So I opened the load game and found out that the other saves are gone. Damn, all the progress... After that, I will not play the game again until this is fixed or I find workarounds.I'm very confused because this is supposed to be a REMASTERED version of the original game, so why do I experience such problems?Well, since I bought the BioShock bundle, maybe I'll play Infinite until everything is fixed.

Crashes (for me personally) are scarce, I've had two happen in four hours. Only pain is they like to happen on loading and saving screens, so save often in case it happens! Beyond that, the textures and all on this game are spot on. Performance is great for me, only weird part was some frame skips with Vsync on, but that was resolved when I limited my FPS and had it on.  I played this on the original Xbox 360 and loved it. It's great to visit rapture again.Update: I have since beat the game and, yes there are crashes. For me, they only came when loading a new area, but that was rare. When it did happen, it was frustrating due to the lack of autosave. My suggestion is to save often (which you should do in any game.) Remember, every game crashes.Overall, I give this game a 8.5/10.

I was willing to buy this game when it was announced, so the fact that I got it for free due to owning the previous version was a very nice surprise.I did need to find a work around for it's glaring crashing issue though before I got the happy place that I am in now.Like I said: this game did crash, a lot. I couldn't even get halfway through Welcome to Rapture. The crashes were especially frustrating because when trying to resume from my previous save I found that my difficulty setting was reset to default along with the Vitachambers Disabled option would be switched to off, that would make beating the game on Survival difficulty without dying incredibly difficult. I came across a post by Brad in steam discussions which suggested this as a fix: ""Go to properties in the bioshock.exe and [select the] ""run as administrator"" and ""run in 640 X 480 screen resolution""[options], don't worry this will only effect your desktop resolution and not in-game [resolution]."" He suggests launching the game only from the .exe, however I have been gutsy and risked my save by launching through steam a few times afterwards with no ill effects.I understand everyone's disappointment for the lack of adjustment options from the menu, however it is my understanding you can still go to the .ini and change the options which you would like to change- should that be necessary in 2016? No, definitely not. But that isn't going to stop me from recommending this game to someone because they have to go and manually change an option this way.There are a couple other bugs which the community seems to be reporting such as missing textures and audio issues, I can't say that I have experienced these and I can only hope that a patch is released which fixes these problems.Overall my experience in game has been a good one, and I recommend anyone wishing to (re)visit Rapture give this version a try; the extra polish is a nice touch and mostly understated so it still feels like the Bioshock I love and remember."

If you're new to the Bioshock series and are thinking about trying it out, then I cannot honestly recommend the remastered edition in its current state and you're definitely safer starting off with the original releases or just wait for them to patch out the issues plaguing the remastered edition if you really want to play those.  As of this writing I'm about two hours into Bioshock remastered - haven't tried Bioshock 2 remastered yet.  I will say the improved graphics are nice when the textures aren't flickering like a CRT monitor.  The definite deal breaker though is that in my multiple playthrough attempts the game has without fail crashed to desktop every time I've picked up the armor piercing bullets in that closet with the turret in it in the Medical Pavilion.  This has happened twice in a row so far and from what I've read, I've been having one of the ""better"" experiences with this game so far.Also one other thing I've noticed that I'm not sure is actually a fault with the game or not, but oddly it seems to me that it's a lot harder to hit enemies with the electro-bolt plasmid in the remastered edition.  Even when it looks like my reticule is dead on target, something like two out of three times it'll just miss them by a hair which is immensely frustrating since the ""one-two punch"" is pretty much your bread and butter in the first couple of levels in this game.  Again though, I don't know if I can pin this on the remastered release or not - it's entirely possible that I'm just bad at hitting people with the electro-bolt, although I don't remember having this problem in the original release.  And I'm only bringing this up because I'm curious if other people have noticed this as well and if they have any advice on the subject.Anyway, it's looking like there are fixes on the way which is good news.  But until they've been implemented, I can't in good conscience recommend anyone who doesn't already own these games on steam try the remastered editions.EDIT: I've played completely through both remasters since this review and I am very pleased to say that they've largely fixed the issues I initially had and from my experience they are both in a playable state.  The graphical changes they made really did spruce up the first game quite a bit and an FOV slider is always welcome.  As for the second game, any changes they made graphically are barely noticeable, and between the first two games it probably needed the least improvement anyway as it was already a pretty good looking game.

The problems that I've experienced are some that other reviews have mentioned. The game overall is fairly buggy and even set piece moments have bugged out on me. The part in Medical Pavilion where the random doctor throws bandages toward you went haywire and he flew around the room with the other items. Little things like this have popped up.

I've never played any of the BioShock games, and I had purchased the collection on a whim during one of the Steam sales but never installed or played them. I noticed a few weeks ago that Remastered versions had been automatically added to my library, and I thought it would be a great time to play through the whole series for the first time.I invested several hours playing this game, and I was really loving it - but unfortunately it was like it was waiting for me to get just far enough in that I was hooked before all the random bugs started popping up. Trying to change the volume on my computer pops random in-game windows open and closed suddenly. More importantly, the game crashes constantly regardless of what graphics settings I use - default included. The game crashes at random moments, and after key events - resetting me back to my last save when I reload.The worst bug I've encountered so far is also the one that's made the game virtually unplayable. Trying to use any of the gene-bank machines to swap abilities crashes my game every single time - meaning I'm unable to change the key abilities that the game is designed around. I'm stuck with the two I've got loaded in the order it put them in, and even though I have purchased two additional slots and have more abilities available I can not put anything into them without the game crashing. At this point, I can't keep playing the game in its condition. To see that the last time this game got an update was back in October, and it still hasn't been properly fixed, is really a disappointing introduction to this series.I'm going to have to uninstall this remastered version and go play the old original if I want to continue, meaning I'll have to replay everything I've already done. It's going to feel like a major downgrade now that I've spent hours playing the Remastered version and that's all I know of the game.

Seriously, you haven't aged a day and if I'm not mistaken your resolution is looking particularly fit.  You always were the best aquatic-based steampunk game. Hell, you're the only one of those games that I can think of. What's more, your action rpg elements ensure that players will have plenty to do as this dark  journey takes them ever closer to Andrew Ryan and a rather morbid revelation of sorts.  Furthermore, the recorders collected throughout the game really add depth to the story as they often reveal the twisted, intricate plot details as both the story and the very foundation of Rapture itself unravels.Alas, the remastered version, though better than the original, is not without issues.  My personal experience with this game was for the most part exceptional in that I only suffered several crashes and a bizarre glitch that apparently caused the game to be set to normal difficulty when I had clearly selected the hardest setting from the outset - throughout the game the damage inflicted on enemies and caused by the same appeared to be the higher difficulty setting but it was only after beating the game and not unlocking the difficulty level associated achievements I was expecting to unlock that I realized there was an issue. Solution: reload the final battle, confirm that the game was for some reason stuck on normal, reset it to survival, and proceed to unlock the achievements I should have already unlocked.Those things aside, Bioshock still remains one of the greatest/most important game series to date and shouldn't be passed up by any gamer that's a fan of shooters with a hearty dose of action rpg elements and even a touch of sci-fi horror as garnish. There are apparently some fixes in the works for those suffering major issues, so hang tight and have fun when you finally do get around to playing this modern classic."

While I experienced a few crashes early on they all occured when loading the game up or changing the graphics settings. I have never had the game crash mid-gameplay. In my opinion this is the superior version of the game simply because of the addition of achievements. As someone who originally played Bioshock on Xbox 360 many years ago I was disapointed that the Steam version didn't have any of the rather nostalgic achievements like 'Brass balls'. This is an issue I have with many amazing games that are shared between Steam and Xbox like Oblivion, Elder scrolls for example, that still to this day lacks achievments. It's still a bit of a sore spot for me and this remastered version is exactly what I was looking for and i'll accept whatever loading screen problems there are because once i've managed to load the game it plays fine.

Despite this, I think that, after the updates, Bioshock Remastered is worth getting.  It's the same incredible atmosphere, game feel, story, and mechanics as the original with a fresh, and very pretty, coat of paint.Everything that made the original great is here.  Without spoiling too much for anyone who might not already have played the original, the plot is steeped in philosophy and weird science, acting as an excellent critique of Ayn Rand's Objectivism.  It's always easy to see that it's building up to something, and the plot twist towards the end is legendary.  The plasmids, while not as necessary as they might seem at first, add an interesting aspect to combat, and this is one of the first games I personally played that uses its environments in clever ways during fights.  The trailers do plenty to show what kind of atmosphere the game has, and while not the scariest ""horror"" game, it does have some great creepy moments.Unfortunately, a lot of what was wrong with the PC version is still wrong with the remaster, even after updates.  The game runs for me, but I often have to reset my graphics settings, and I'll occasionally see glitches like texture pop-in and physics objects floating on air to a corner of the room.  The developer fixed a few things from the original, such as the strange ragdoll animation, and in a post-launch update they fixed the FOV issue that has plagued the PC version since its original launch, but I still see a lot of mistakes that I can't help think could easily have been avoided.  I also had one of the better experiences with the remaster, as it seems some people couldn't even get it to run.I can only speak based on my own experience, but I would recommend this game, especially to anyone who got it for free if they had the original in their library already.  It's a classic, and I don't see it getting old any time soon.  There's a reason this was exhibited in the Smithsonian."

In the end, there are probably tons of things this remaster could've done better, but as my experience so far has been mostly without trouble, there is no hesitation for me personally to give this game a positive review. Even with all of the faults reported, this still one of the best games ever made.Although this is a remaster, the base game clearly shows its age as environment and character models or animations aren't up to today's AAA standards. That doesn't mean that game looks bad as Rapture's decaying Art Deco environments still look beautiful and have tons of details. This is also where both the original BioShock and remastered version shine as the game still delivers an unique atmosphere, a feel of utopia turned to dystopia, which is something rarely seen as succesfully made for any other FPS game. Remains of the Rapture's glory days can be seen everywhere during the gameplay, but current underwater world is full of sorrow and suffering caused by the corruption of moral values of the people. BioShock delivers this story very well.Game's atmosphere is thus top notch and it beautifully combines horror, action and adventure themes. Where game doesn't shine is gunplay, something that IMO isn't the strongest part of any of the BioShock games. It is difficult to pinpoint why, but somehow it feels incredibly clumsy (without actually being so) and unrewarding. So, if you are looking for a fluid action shooter, BioShock isn't probably for you. If you are looking for unique atmosphere, well written and deep story, then this game is still one of the best options out there."

This ""remaster"" is not only stagnant, in various ways it's a regression. In 8 hours of play, I experienced half a dozen situations where the game executable simply gave up and culmitavely wiped hours of progress. Not only does this make losing large chunks of game progression a risky threat it also annoyingly resets the games graphics, audio and gameplay settings each time it happens. In addition the map/quest sub-screen suffers from a two second delay in opening, a bug which was not present in the original BioshockBioshock is an incredible game, even 9 years on from it's original release, it's world, it's characters, it's story-line and the delivery are all fantastic elements but this edition of it is simply not the optimal way to experience the game.

,Recommended,409710,27184732,"Posted: 24 November, 2016",all,CBats,"Regarded as the ‘Big Daddy’ of world design and storytelling in video games, the original Bioshock in 2007 proved to the world that games should be taken seriously as art. And nine years on, the opportunity to explore under the sea has arisen again.Bioshock Remastered is a free re-release of the original Bioshock for PC players who own the original game on steam. It was overseen by the studio Blind Squirrel Games and involves a revamp of the original game’s graphics and performance, as well as a new series of documentaries titled ‘Imagining Bioshock’ that explore the creation of the game with original key developers.Considering the original game is now edging on ten years old, its a testament to how incredibly revolutionary was that it still holds up. The story follows protagonist Jack when his plane crashes into the ocean in 1960, only for him to discover a mysterious and derelict underwater city run by the enigmatic Andrew Ryan. This city, Rapture, is the soul of what makes Bioshock so incredible. Not only is it an amazing setting for a game, its created through world design that was unparalleled at the time of release. The cracking hull of Rapture is an intensely creepy and atmospheric setting. Mysterious shadows creep up the walls, water leeks across the floor, and its horrific citizens fill the air with blood-curling screeches of pain and madness. Its a place that is clearly descending into hell, and manages to convey so much with saying very little. Environmental storytelling is the main device that original developer Irrational Games utilised to tell its compelling narrative, and its astonishing how much story they can create from something as little as a tape, a teddy bear and a body in a drain. To put it simply, Rapture quite literally drips with story and is at the crux of what makes Bioshock so special.The other pillar of the Bioshock experience, the gameplay, obviously cannot live up to the storytelling side but still manages to be compelling enough to happily see you through the 12 hour campaign. Jack uses many different methods to get through the treacherous corridors of Rapture, including basic gunplay with standard first-person shooter weapons, as well an assortment of different genetic abilities known as Plasmids. The gunplay, particularly after the progress videogames have made forward in the last 10 years, doesn’t hold up incredibly well. Its still enjoyable enough, but lacks the weight and punch expected from a modern FPS. This shortcoming is luckily covered by the Plasmids however, as they not only allow you to mix up combat in interesting ways, such as with lightning, telekinesis and hypnosis, but also add some much needed dynamism to the gameplay outside of filling enemies with lead. Outside of basic combat, there’s also the need to hack machines and explore the environment that must be contended with. The mini-game used to hack is simple, but effective and never gets old enough to the point that it becomes frustrating. The exploration of the environment on the contrary is a complete delight, as Bioshock‘s level design is comfortably on par with its setting. Each section of Rapture is distinct and offers many branching paths and hidden corners to explore.So while its been established that the ‘Bioshock‘ part of the titled is incredible, its unfortunately the ‘Remastered‘ aspect that drags the overall product down. To get the good things out of the way, Blind Squirrel Games did a decent job improving the graphics to a solid level, and the additional documentary is likely to be fascinating for new and old fans alike. However, its the technical support on that is legitimately disappointing. At launch, the game missed a number of significant graphic’s features, several key resolutions and suffered from a whole swarm of frustrating bugs. Granted, many of those issues were fixed in a patch released almost a month later, but even after that I still continued to suffer from frustratingly frequent crashes to desktop. I estimate that I lost almost two hours of gameplay to lax saving and a subsequent crash. Its genuinely disappointing considering the quality of the game itself, and makes this remaster feel more like a cash-grab than a loving re-release of a modern classic.That being said, this is still the best way to experience this masterpiece of game design. Certainly the technical side is a let down, but the sheer quality and richness of the experience on hand almost makes trudging through the bugs and crashes worthwhile. If you haven’t dived into Bioshock before, would you kindly purchase this remaster, because everyone deserves to go on this incredible journey under the sea.Casual Gamer: Must-playHardcore Gamer: Highly RecommendedNarrative Driven: Must-play"

I'm so glad that 2K gave a free copy of the Remastered editions for everyone who owned the original titles. The game is just as fun and immersive as i remember.So, now the problems...My absolute biggest issue was the constant crashing, if you play this i strongly urge you to hit the quick save button like every 5 minutes or so. Now there are some fixes out there people have suggested and i will place them below this segment. But please note that i had finished the game before i found these fixes online and never got to try them out so i cannot vouch for them. But if they help then great.1) Platform Update for Windows 7 (General Crash Fix)Now if you have a legit version of Windows 7 and keep relatively up to date with windows updates, then more than likely you have this update installed already. (but check by going into Windows update > View update history > See installed updates and type in the search bar at the top right ""KB2670838"")if it appears then you have it installed, if not then install it now.If you do not have the update installed then download it here:https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=368052) Run as... (Small Crash Fix)ok, this i hate to recommend but people have said that it works.Locate your Bioshock.exe file in which ever drive you have the game installed.typically: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\BioshockRemastered\Builds\Final\Bioshock.exeOnce you see the .exe file right click it and go ""Properties"" then ""Compatibility"" and tick:""Run in 640x480 screen resolution"" and""Run this program as an administrator""This will not set the in-games resolution to 480p but your desktop resolution.Lastly be sure to launch from the .exe file from now on and NOT from steam.For quick access to the .exe, hold CTRL + SHIFT and drag the file to the desktop to create a shortcut the file.So basically that's all i am here to say. Yes these problems should not exsist and should be corrected. but i specifically cannot complain as i recieved the 2 games for free.Should i pay for the game in its current state and risk the fixes working?NoShould i buy it on significant sale?If you have never played the original and have a decent medium to high end PC then i say yes, it's a risk but at the discounted price it's not a huge loss. however the choice is still yours.If i have never played Bioshock (ever) which should i buy?unless it is fixed from its current state, buy the original to ensure a higher chance of a proper working gameUltimately this is your choice, i cannot tell you what to do and i cannot tell you how to spend your money. However i can tell you my experiences and some quick fix info that i found to help you get it running better however i can (should you choose to purcahse the game).Thanks for reading, anyone who has some tips and fixes to help get the game running better is welcome to leave a response in this thread.btw i only gave this game a thumbs up as it skewed ever so slightly that way for me personally, if there was a mixed option or of that equivalent, i would have chosen that one."

But leaving my oringal review just so you can see how much my point of view changed. Two major things have lead me to delete this game before finishing it. First: I was super exicted about playing through this game with steam achievments. I wanted to get them all the first time through. I start the game on surivial and turned Vita chambers off to get ""brass balls"" a hidden achievment. I played 8 hours. Was having a blast. Then the next day I played another 6 hours before I died and got sent to vita chamber. This ruins the achievments for all saves even if you reload. Then I realize the game is now set on medium diff. I find out reseting all your choices is another bug. Whatever. Two achievments busted. I am pretty bummed but the game is fun so I keep playing. I am on the last level now and I chugging along. its hard going since I put it back on survior and no Vita chambers (the game is too easy otherwise IMO). Then near the end of the level the game crashes and erases my quick save. My last hard save was at the start of the level over two hours agian. Not going through this agian. I can deal with all the other bugs. But these two bugs have 100% ruined all the fun of this game. Free or not.Oringal review:What a bunch of whiny self entitled gamers. I honestly can believe so many people are crying like little babies over this game. ""all they added was FOV expansion"", ""I can't select 144mhz"", ""mouse acceleration, bla bla bla"".So what? This free upgrade, now with much better textures (and I think the lighting looks better), is one of the best game EVER made. Yes there are a few weird bugs like the mouse not always working? Is it game breaking? No! Would it stop me from recommending this game to people? Of course not.And if you want 144mhz just set framerate to ""max"". I have a 75mhz monitor (overclocked HDTV) and my game is running at 75fps.Even if you have to pay 20$ for this game it is an amazing experience. Play it with a controller if mouse acceleration bothers you so much. I have beaton this game on every system it ever came out on. Now I am going through it a 4th time. So far its a 8/10 and only loses 1 point for them not fixing the bugs from the original PC release and not offering more (video) options in the menu, but gets 1 point back because now you get Steam achievments."

Best way to put it, if your game crashes say goodbye to all of your golden reels which are the developer commentaries, your keybindings and pretty much any settings you have changed. Fortunetely in the 5 times the games crashed so far I have only lost these and not my saved data. As everyone else has been saying the game only auto saves when you reach a new area which is about 40-60 mins lost if the game crashes if you havent manually saved.This is a deal breaker even when receiving the game technically for free due to owning the original.Please do not support this remaster until many reviews verify the crashing issue to be fixed."

Bioshock is a great game, i love the art style, the story, the atmosphere.  It feels unique and is entertaining. Sadly this hd remaster has many a problem.  I am downloading the new bug fix patch now but i ran into several issues. One of the biggest offenders is the game roughtly every 2 hours will crash to desktop.  This can happen anywhere, at anytime. Even during a save. I ended up saving every 10 minutes to not lose progress.  The ui is somewhat unresponsive and the inventory and quest map takes about 5 seconds to load.  Everything freezes and then it finally loads.  There were some visual glitches with areas that are flooded, and sometimes settings were not saved upon crash.  Considering how many crashes i had, this was frustrating. I loved bioshock but if you buy this be warned, there were a lot of technical issues."

Yes they mostly refurbished the graphics (I actually saw some water effects glitches on Ultra settings), everything else regarding the code is exactly the same - including any glitches that were around before.This in turn makes it feel like a lazy installation and money seeking scheme, but you can't exactly blame the companies, as it has been occuring with pretty much every big label (see Modern Warfare, Elder Scrolls). Although, the aforementioned remasters are for the most part better done than this one is.I got this game for free which I think is the right thing to do on the publisher's part, and for that reason I'll have to recommend the game. I'm grateful for the Steam achievements - as an achievement hoarder I was missing this in the original Bioshock - but I wouldn't necessarily pay $20 for some achievements and somewhat updated graphics. Yes, the original Bioshock might be a better purchase come Steam sales, but this is at its core the exact same game, and should be judged as such.[100% Achievement Difficulty: 3/10, I picked up absolutely all of the single player achievements in one playthrough due to an exploit that was in the original. I got the achievements for realsies in the original Bioshock so I'm not ashamed of it, but for purists that might make it a bit more difficult.]"

My complaint isn't the issue that the remastered version plays like garbage with the glitching surroundings, its that what started as a promising story feels forced. I really felt like this plot was almost a complete afterthought once I started the actual gameplay, which feels like it has no weight, it just feels floaty. Most other FPS games you feel like you are doing more than pushing buttons when your character is firing a gun or casting a spell or whatever. I also feel like the use of the vita chambers, as the game calls them, they're just spawn points if you die, take away any insentive to NOT die. If you want to conserve items and you're near a vita chamber just whip out the wrench and run at whatever you want to kill screaming until you die, rinse repeat. You'll be brought right back to the vita chamber in the area where any enemy you didn't kill is right there with whatever health they have left.I am going to finish this game and depending on that I may change my review, delete this one, or write a new one all together.tl;dr feels forced, fart/love/games if you have to force it, it's probably♥♥♥♥♥"

Bioshock was and is an amazing game. This remaster is bugged and lazy. I feel obliged to leave a negative review, for steam reviews are a way to send a message to developers. For PC this remaster is pointless. The issues with mouse acceleration and such could have been fixed with a patch (Not to mention that they were not fixed on release of the remaster but have been now). Not enough assets have been improved and the remaster is a technical mess.There are numerous techical issues with the game. By far the biggest is with the audio. Sounds are all over the place. Often sounds come through walls or from the wrong side. Easiest this is to note when switching weapons: Sometimes the sound comes from left speaker, sometimes right and sometimes from both. One area seems to miss most of the ambient noises. It's really mixed up and makes it hard to play.Another issue is that everything gets stuck to walls. Worst are the Big Daddies who are the most iconic aspect of this game. They constantly get stuck and just jitter in place. This makes defeating them really easy. Animations looks old and wonky and this hurts the atmosphere of the game. With care these could have been fixed.The game also crashed atleast three times. All of these were in the menus which is strange.The download is almost 4 times larger than original Bioshock, but the game looks just as i remembered Bioshock to look. I'm sure if compared side to side, the remaster has sharper textures, but polygons have not been added. This is unless you count barnacles and glowy jellyfishes here and there.If the controller is enabled, the game switches to wrong button promps at random. Textures load with a delay or sometimes refuse to load. Mouse sensitivity goes insane in cutscenes where player has some control. Quicksaving and loading takes few seconds even on SSD. While not huge issues, these are the little touches that remasters should fix.It's such a shame that this is the remaster we get. A lot more could and should have been done."

That said, if you got this for free and have wanted to replay Bioshock this is a very good time to do so, particularly if you enjoy steam trading cards and/or steam achievements, as it has added both.The gameplay is solid, though it takes a bit of getting used to swapping between plasmids and guns.Overall, there really isn't anything new added to the game if you already owned the original, though this includes the DLC, which I never purchased before, so there's that.*EDIT* I will leave my previous review underneath, untouched, for posterity.Bioshock Demastered is such a ♥♥♥♥ing mess right now.

Scientific progress greatly expanded, including the discovery of the genetic material ""ADAM"" created by sea slugs on the ocean floor. ADAM allows its users to alter their DNA to grant them super-human powers like telekinesis and pyrokinesis. To protect Rapture, Ryan imposed a law that no contact with the surface world was allowed.Despite the apparent utopia, class distinctions grew, and former gangster and businessman Frank Fontaine used his influence of the lower class to plan a coup of Rapture. Fontaine profited by creating black market routes with the surface world, and together with Dr. Brigid Tenenbaum, created a cheap plasmid industry by mass-producing ADAM through the implanting of the slugs in the stomachs of orphaned girls, nicknamed ""Little Sisters"". Fontaine used his plasmid-enhanced army to attack Ryan, but reportedly was killed in the battle. Ryan took the opportunity to seize his assets including the plasmid factories. In the months that followed, a second figure named Atlas rose to speak for the lower class, creating further strife. Atlas led attacks on the factories housing the Little Sisters, and Ryan countered by creating ""Big Daddies"", plasmid-enhanced humans surgically grafted into giant lumbering diving suits who were psychologically compelled to protect the Little Sisters at all costs. Ryan also created his own army of plasmid-enhanced soldiers, named ""Splicers"", which he controlled using pheromones distributed through Rapture's air system. This Remastered version of Bioshock is beautifully done it will be an awsome gem in your library of games."

The FOV slider doesn't adjust weapon FOV.- Visual artifact present on items randomly.- Due to driver updates, the light flickering visual bug is back, but V-sync fixes still.- Some Low quality audio may be heard in menu.*ATTENTION*This is my experiences with a several playthroughs of the remaster. This review is accounting for the first and second patch that was released on October 7 2016 and December 20th 2016. This current December 20th 2016 patch has fixed many of the previous bad changes introduced in the Remastered version.I am incredibly happy that 2K  responded to my emails about the FOV scale, and HUD font size problems, and managed to fix both of those problems with this December 20th 2016 patch.Although many people are still experiencing crashes, and various other problems. I hope 2K and the developers keep releasing patches to fix many of the fans problems with the Remastered versions.I also know this is a free upgrade, but this does not make it impervious to criticism, nor does it make the remastered any better. I would've paid for a proper Remaster of the original Bioshock and Bioshock 2.After several months after the last December 20th 2016 patch, and seeing less crashing reports, I must recommend this game as the definitive version to play. Thank you 2K, 2k Support, and the developement teams fixing, and improving BioShock for all the die-hard fans like myself."

The hacking is still worthless and boring, the sound quality is all over the place (the guns sound low-quality but the filters on story dialogue have been reworked???), and the gunplay still feels very squishy. I also had a weird glitch where with a controller plugged in, the game worked with WASD but camera only worked with R-stick.But the story, gameplay, and aesthetic of this game are worth it alone. Don't go in expecting a totally reworked visual experience, and you'll find yourself enjoying BioShock Remastered. It's also awesome that B1 owners got the Remaster for free, as I'd feel a bit ripped off if the game I rebought was THIS similar.Also, enable V-Sync, as a change they made to the visuals with flashing lights causes some visual effects to flicker in awkward patterns if you run this game at a higher framerate than your monitor.

This has to be the best remastered game I've ever played before. From the restoration of the graphics, to the added content, and developer commentary; this game has tons to offer to people whom has already playedBioShockbefore. For those who have never playedBioShockthis is definitely a great way to jump into an old series.There's really nothing I can say as a counter point to the good aspects of this game. Anything negative I could think to say about this game would have to be about the base game it's self. The only negative thing I could think of is that the game was too easy, key word beingWAS. They added a new difficulty mode which becomes the new hardest difficulty, and in that adds some real challenge to the game. Big Daddy fights become a challenge (at least at first, and only if you don't know the best ways to eliminate them) through out the whole game, as well as everything else becoming more threatening. On top of that they added new game plus mode where now you can start inRapturewith everything you can possibly wreck havoc with!Would I recommend it to others? Yes!

While this Remaster isn't really anything that'll blow your socks off, I'm glad it exists. The graphical improvements only add to the atmosphere (once again, this is going off of what I've seen of the original).While the Remaster has it's issues, it never once dropped FPS or anything like that for me. While that's probably just because my PC is a monster, there was never a case where I had a performance issue while playing.The Remaster adds Steam achievements and trading cards, which I quite like.Optional 4k Res.Cons:While the Remaster never crashed mid-game for me, the game wiped almostALLof my Save Files about 3 times over the course of my playthrough, costing me about 4h of additional playtime. I don't know what causes the Remaster to wipe saves after you exit the game, but it does happen occasionally.This Remaster (like most 4k games, so I've heard) causes the Steam in-game overlay to appearextremelytiny (if you're playing in it 4k res)Steam sometimes thinks that this game is running when it isn't, adding extra hours to your game-time history. If you're like me, this is extremely annoying, and can only be fixed by shutting down steam and restarting your PC. Because of this issue I have around 10 extra hours clocked into the game.- - - -Final Verdict:Aside from a few issues the Remaster provided, I'd say I had fun playing Bioshock. It was quite longer than I expected. which was a welcome surprise. I'll probably be starting the 2nd game in a few days. Although I'd recommend this Remaster, I don't really think it deserves aCDN $21.99pricetag. If you're happy with the Original I'd say wait until this goes on sale before purchasing.As a final side-note, I believe I received the Bioshock Remasters for free. I can't recall for sure though, as I purchased the Bioshock games on 1/1/2015, and have only recently got around to playing them."

Anyway, following the procedure one might already know from series like Fallout (saving often and in different slots), this shouldn't really have such a big impact. With my game there was only a single area where I had (reproducible) crashes; apparently that's a bug from the original game.Regarding the game itself, BioShock is definitely a work of art. Not only is atmosphere riveting with a rather unique and beautiful art style but the plot is honestly one of the best things ever. I'm not really one for politics but it was absolutely fascinating to see the effects of an idelogy and how a utopa eventually fails and turns into a place of horror and despair.Really, the plot is frickin' great. The characters are frickin' great.The gameplay is good, I think. The change between weapons and plasmids gives you nice tactical options, the upgrade system is pretty good, and that's pretty much it. The minigame is, well, a minigame and thus horribly repetitive after a while. The enemies are not that challenging (though I've only played on medium difficulty). All in all, it's good but nothing especially outstanding.The plot though. It's just amazing and by far enough reason to play this game.I've not had any contact with the BioShock series prior to this game so I can't really compare it to the original BioShock 1. I'd say that it's a must-have though."

Not even making it - remaking an existing one in improved graphics... Altough I have to admit - it might be hard because bethesda did the same thing when ""remastering"" (butchering) Skyrim. I launched the game, selected game difficulty, watched the video and then the game crashed. I tried again - another crash. Turns out the issue is being caused by the default settings selecting appropriate resolution for my screen. And so to get the game to work I had to sacrifice the resolution, but no matter - I lowered it and started playing the game. A few hours in the game crashed and I lost almost all my progress. I resumed the game but it just did it again - another hour or two lost.... Yes I know I am supposed to save often on games that crash such as this one but god damn it - if you aren't going to fix the crashes themselves, can you at least make the game autosave every 5 minutes automatically?!?!?!?!?! I feel like they aren't even trying to address this issue in any way - judging by the reviews the crashes have been there for a year and even though it no longer crashes every second like some reveiws stated, it is still in a beta stage by my standards.UPDATE: Game looks fixed now but it is hella boring.

However, this version of the game is unstable with unpredicatable and frustrating crashes. The unfortunate thing is the autosave feature doesn't protect your progress (you'll be starting levels over, levels which can take hours to complete, and the crash deletes all level progress/unlocks.With that said, the game is a must play because it's the beginning of the Bioshock franchise, but do yourself a favor and save frequently (DO NOT RELY ON AUTOSAVES)!!!"

One thing that I don't understand about the remastered version is the backlash and hate towards it.I mean, sure it's not leaps and bounds of an improvement. But it's a PC version of a game which the original PC version did not work in anyway shape or form unless you modified the game files yourself. For me, that's enough. The game doesn't need fancy changes, sure there's the occasionally graphical glitch, and the character models for cutscenes could have done with a little bit of a touch up (looking at you Tenenbaum and Langford who do not look anything like their little portrait in recordings), the game at its core is still wonderful.In my opinion, I think the term Remastered hurt the game due to the fan's expectations of more. They added in a few graphical options sure, but not really enough to call it a remastered. In my opinion, if you've already got a working version of the first game don't bother buying the remastered unless you want it on PC or the latest Xbox/Playstation."

When I saw that they had the whole franchise on sale, I went and bought it so that I could finally own it on Steam. What was even better was you got the Remastered version with the regular version. Good deal all around.Well, 2K you really messed up this brilliant game. At least the Steam verison anyway.I don't recommend this version in it's current state at all. It's super buggy and it lags almost constantly. Audio will cut out, things will glitch, the game could crash when you save and erase all of your progress. I gave this game a chance, and for the first 4 hours, it was really nice to me. But then all hell broke loose and it all came crashing down. Literally. It recently crashed my whole computer and I had to reboot it.Until they fix the many problems this Remastered version has, I don't recommend playing it. Maybe one day I'll change my review, but for now, it's a no from me, and that's a hard thing to say for me."

Wonder if it still has bugs in it.tl;dr -- You're the friend of the parasite if you didn't play this game, remastered or original.This game is one of my all-time favourite, and has been since I first played it years ago.  Playing it again feels like the first time again -- in the good way as in the bad. People claim that bugs that were already present in the original release are back in this remastered version, plus exclusive new ones. Moreover, I do not find the visual upgrade to be that striking. It would have been such a delight to see Rapture with a beautiful facelift. As that Steinman's Clinic advertisement said: ""With Adam there's no reason not to be beautiful!""On the plus side, I personally encountered much less bugs as I did with the original release of the game, having experienced only a tiny visual bug somewhere in Neptune's Bounty. There are also some improvements, such as much more customizable key mapping. The original key customization was so bad I couldn't play on my pc (long story short, the game detected my keyboard setting as a french one and some key was mapped to ""w"" without letting me change it, and that's not the only ""core"" key that was wrongly mapped). Nonetheless, this remastered version is the only one I can run with my setup.Overall, this remastered doesn't add much value to the game and I have to admit I maybe wouldn't have bought it if I didn't recieved it for free (thanks 2K!). However, it is still worth picking Bioshock up if you haven't already played it, as it is one of the, if not the very, best game of its time."

The story and game play was alot of fun which kept up late on more than a few nights.Looks very nice compared to original which I never found time to complete untill the remaster came along.The only issue i had with this is the crashes which are a real pain and couple of times did almost make me want to quit as almost  broke my interest. It seemed to happen at random times but more often when I tried to access the map. Unfortunately some crashes did need a reboot and had erased my last save but luckily only happened a few times out of the countless other crashes. That being said the original wasn't much better for crashes which is why I didn't complete up till now.If you have any Icc profiles calibrating your monitor this game ignores the profiles as does Bioshock 2, unlike Infinity.Overall I do recommend as it's a great game but the crashes could be a deal breaker for some.

I immediatly installed it and played it and it felt brand new again.As a game: Bioshock is incredible. It's setting and story fascinate me, and it's singleplayer FPS gameplay/progression is well done.But this is a remaster, and as others have said, the game is not without its bugs. Personally, I experienced no bugs or crashes when playing through the entire game, but because of the bugs so many others complain about, I would recommend purchasing with caution.But as a fan of Bioshock, I would recommend this remaster, as it makes the game feel new again. The new, higher resolution textures look great, and the lighting system looks so much better than the original. The game also includes developer commentary that dives into the process behind the creation of the game, coupled with a concept art and scrapped ideas museum that you can walk through and see much more of what the game could have been, if not for time and budget constraints. Other than that, the game is exactly the same as the original, but with a nice polish. I appreciate the effort the devs put in to one of my favorite games.Should you purchase this game?The answer resolves to a resounding: maybe. I am biased, as I recieved the game for free and I encountered no bugs, so take what I say with a grain of salt. I do, however, recommend it, as it was, and still is, a great game.

Bioshocks autosave system is also not great, it saves everytime you enter a new area, this is something you didn't really have to worry about in the original because it didn't crash. However, In the remaster you could spend 2 hours exploring an area and as you are loading the next area the game will crash. This is eternally frustrating as when you try to counter act this by manually saving the game has about a 1 in 10 chance of crashing and not saving.  Besides all this the game is still fun, but you have to remain patient with it. Don't quit the first time it crashes, Don't blame the game for the lazyness of the developers, I you can make it through the game it is definitely worth it. Bioshock is still a great game and I still love it."

No more ini editing required to get the game running properly. It also won't reset your settings anymore after a crash.A few hours into the game however, it becomes clear that it is still riddled with issues, e.g. sometimes crashes when opening the map, major graphical glitches when vsync is turned off, misplaced subtitle box and many more, especially related to audio.It is however somewhat playable and if you've received the remaster for free you should try it, since Bioshock is actually a REALLY good game. I recommend saving frequently though (there are no autosaves except for when you enter a new level, which is about every 2-3 hours).=== Original review ===I'm REALLY disappointed about this remaster, because they didn't fix the games biggest problems, that have been discussed endlessly in the community FOR THE PAST 9 YEARS:- poor mouse sensitivity option (mouse is too fast even on lowest sensitivity)- can't turn off mouse acceleration IN A SHOOTER- mouse hardly controllable in menus- horribly small, unchangable FOV, that people get headaches fromI expected, that if they we're to change ANYTHING in this remaster, it would be to tackle these long-standing issues. But nothing has improved. It's ridiculous.I don't know how many people are affected, but for me, the game also crashes every few minutes (the famous ""Bioshock.exe has stopped working""), as Bioshock original did, too. Apparently they haven't improved the compatibility with Windows 7, 8 and 10 either.The updated textures are a nice-to-have, but not enough to qualify for a grand announced ""remaster"". I'm mad I had gotten my hopes up for a finally playable version of Bioshock, because this one isn't it. At least I didn't have to spend money to be disappointed. Still, this remaster is a joke, 2K embarrassed themselves and nobody should pay for it.EDIT: I wish it would at least stop resetting all options every other launch."

Don't get me wrong, BioShock is a game that everyone should experience; some of the game mechanics are quite dated, but once you're used to them the atmosphere and world of Rapture is something that begs to be explored.The major niggle I have is with the Remastered version specifically; in the 12-14 hours it took me to complete the story, the game crashed unexplicably about 5 times, causing me to replay 30 minutes or so of gameplay each time it did so. You may think that saving often is an easy solution to this, but frustratingly 3 of my crashes occurred when I pressed save. These constant crashes meant that by the time I was around 3/4 of the way through the game all I wanted to do was rush through, which is frustrating because of how much I enjoyed exploring every inch of the submerged city. If you're an achievement junkie I say give it a go and try to perservere through the occassional crash, but if you're not too bothered in the way of achievements definitely play the original version, the game is no less enjoyable. By the time I'd decided on this I was too well invested in this edition.TL;DR:If you care about achievements give it a go and try to persevere, otherwise play the original edition.

Anyway, the graphics are pretty good. I experienced no bugs, except the ""No Sound"" Bug. Since it is very easy to fix, its not really a problem imo.The only thing that really disappointed me was the story to be honest. I saw the ""twist"" already in Level 1, no joke. It was super obvious. Of course not in every detail, but the most important part. After the ""twist"" was revealed i hoped that there will be more to it afterwards, but there wasn't. In the end i really can't explain why a lot of reviews and fans think it is ""the best ending/twist ever in a videogame"". It's definitely not.Still, it is a really good game and the world of rapture is awesome. It is fun to explore the city and to find knew information about its secret society, etc. The Gameplay works great, too. And ofc the atmosphere is one of the best i ever experienced in a videogame.All in all it is a very good game and you should definitely play it. But maybe you should also reconsider your expectations on  the story itself, which was pretty mediocre if you ask me."

This game is still the original bioshock that released years back. The graphics are not going to be Triple A worthy and have a chance when compared to Battlefield 1 or the latest FPS that is released. But the game still looks leagues better than the original and it still has the same fast paced and exciting gameplay that it has always had. People who are expecting a graphical masterpiece in this day and age out of this game are just plain stupid. The game is about 10 years old! But the developers did a damn fine job with this remaster and it is a fantastic game that has pulled me back in yet again. Optimization is not a problem either, of course controlls take a little time to get used to but you can always customize your keys in the settings if you are having any problems and i have not once experienced a crash or freeze in the time that I have played. I highly reccomend this game, the steam review rating should not be as low as it is, and quite frankly it's a damn shame that it is."

,Recommended,409710,33312115,Posted: 6 July,all,Troy Bolton From HSM,"Well, The ending of this game made me feel like an♥♥♥♥♥ No spoilers, But a certain 'decision' you make early on in the game predicts the outcome of the game when you finish it. Choose wisely :)Now, To the Review.I loved every moment of this game, I played it on the hard difficulty and found a great balance between the game being challenging and also fun at the same time. The main problem I faced throughout the game were Ammunition and Med kits, But this allowed for a much more stealthy / passive gameplay which I enjoyed. I did try the game on the hardest difficulty, But it just wasn't for me. I think that settings should be left alone unless If you're a hardcore Bioshock enthusiast.Story, Is great. I didn't think this game would top Bioshock Infinite for me, Which I also beat some months ago, But it really did. This is most certainly up there with the best single players I've played. Can't wait to jump into Bioshock 2 which I'll also review.Controls I found were a little bit annoying on the KB+M and could have done with a little reworking considering this is a Remaster, For instance You have to tap CTRL to switch between sprinting and walking, Shift to open up Inventory and Z to aim down sights, which is really dumb, However This is all minor and you really don't need to look down your sights in this game. It just seems a little dated, Just thought I'd add it regardless.Tips you shouldnt ignore -I would HIGHLY Suggest that you manually save this game every so often, And make sure you have a couple of different save files. This game has quite a few bugs I've noticed, For instance on the first missions certain key AI weren't showing up so I couldn't proceed any further, And later on again later in the game I had the same issue. This only happened twice to me, But it's worth noting regardless.This game may also prone to crash a lot. While this only happened to me two or three times in the 15 hours it took me to complete the game, a lot of people are getting a lot more frequent crashes. At one point I lost about 2 hours worth of gameplay which was really frustrating as I had to redo the whole mission.Other than that, I would totally suggest buying this game. It's amazing, Really."

After playing for roughly 7 hours i have to say I'm pleasently surprised. I've only experienced one glitch that lead to a crash and I'm pretty sure it stemmed from me quiting directly to windows instead of quitting to main menu then windows. I've done that since and no more bugs or glitches from me.Gameplay wise this game is awesome. I've never played any of the bioshock so it's all new to me and I'm super hooked.

All they seemed to do was give the Lighthouse a better texture, make a more polished intro, and thats it.- The lighting is SO bugged. everytime there is a flashing light, you get these really annoying black boxes that appear on your screen, not only is it siezure inducing as hell, but its also incredibly annoying and distracting, it makes you never want to use your lightinning bolt again. :(- The audio os sooo broken, I've seen flash games with better audio then this. You hear security cameras from three rooms away, you hear splicers screaming and talking when they are litterally across the damn map and this ruins the quiet and errie moments of the game when all you can hear is faint creepy music and a splicer across Rapture talking about how he bought a new pair of sandals last week.- The worst issue is by far the unstable system that it runs on. This game crashes every two seconds. It doesn't help that there is not a lot of auto save in BioShock, setting you back hours every time you are halfway done with a level.- Remastered also takes hours to download vs the original which only took 20 minutes.All in all, I hated the remastered edition, I couldn't even finish it in the end because it kept crashing, and it should be avoided by you and your family at all costs, and from what I've seen the remaster of BioShcok 2 is just as bad.It's honestly depressing that a game from 2007 looks and runs better then the same game remade in 2016.

It makes it like it's supposed to be a choice, but you're supposed to rescue them.- Game grew significantly harder and your large arsenal of weapons and powers all seemed equally useless.- Near the end, game decideds to not tell you what to do, what you need, or where to go.- Becomes very frusterating, boring, confusing, and tedious late game. On normal and in late game, even common, simple enemies can send you packing.- Final boss too easy.Overall, definately worth playing, but only if you pick it up on a sale.

I don't see it. Where is that remastered stuff? I see some added crabs here and there but nothing that stands out as 'remastered'. Sure the textures are more hires but nothing that makes the game feel improved.Something is very wrong with the audio too. I don't get that same feeling that the original had.The developer commentaries in the game are hidden in the levels. Well hidden. You actually have to find them to be able to watch them. Completing the level is not enough.The Fort-Frolic-slow-walk bug is still there. 9 years in and still there. Yep.In one scene a little sister is playing the hopscotch game. In this 'remastered' version she is not even jumping inside the lines. She is WAY off...IN A SCRIPTED SEQUENCE! How can any developer get that wrong. Unbelievable.It crashed only once and one time is no big deal. I was in one of the last levels when it happened. The thing that got to me was finding out that the settings had been reset when I played it the next time.No, I won't try to complete the game. And no, I will never try Bioshock 2 remastered, in fear of ruining that experience too.Not only are these monumental flaws bad as they are, the developer commentaries show Irrational developers, who developed the original Bioshock and had NOTHING to do with this 'remastered' crap.To you guys that haven't had the Bioshock experience yet, you need the original Bioshock and Bioshock 2.

The game crashes far too frequently and has occasionally done so for me in the middle of saving my game, making me lose far more progress than I'd like. Crashes are definitely the biggest issue with the game and I really doubt they're tied into PC specs as even with an I7 processor and GTX 1070 I still consider myself lucky if I make it more than an hour or so without a crash. Weird lighting effects, lousy looking water, and lack of customization options are a bit of a disappointment for what's considered to be a true HD remake. While it's still the Bioshock we all know and love, and is definitely a visual improvement, the constant bugs and crashes will be sure to ruin your immersion and eat up your time. Stick with the original if possible."

One of the most iconic first person shooters of all time, and arguably one of the best games ever made. On the bases of the gameplay alone. Buy it.But this isn't the place to review the OG Bioshocl this is a remaster, so lets talk about what makes the remaster so good in my opinion.The graphics are improved but on a technical level, obvious things that will stick out right when start the game is the textures are much improved and there are some extra polygons for added detail. Now where people might have trouble seeing the improvements is the lighting and shadow quality, which ARE a definite improvement, and they keep the art style and mood the same as the first game, while adding more depth and overall higher quality assets and artwork across the board.The issue with the remaster is that some issues from 9 years ago still appear here, along with some new ones, I was HOPING the delay on the PC port to the 15th would give them time to iron out things like this, but apparently not. There are some minor graphics issues with lighting, whenever there is a flash of light, such as the beginning encounter with the splicer, and when you electro bolt, there will be a horizontal flickering across the screen.To conclude, Bioshock Remaster takes an amazing game, and adds a new coat of paint to the old gal'.Don't buy this expecting bleeding edge graphics, because it still looks like Bioschock, just with higher quality assets.EDIT : There is ONE BIG problem though, the sensitvity bar is beyond ♥♥♥♥ed, and the graphics options are almost nonexistent, and if you have weaker hardware, this could lead to ALOT of ini tweaking."

,Recommended,409710,34228741,Posted: 13 August,all,The Aurian,"Absolutely phenomenal game all around. It was one of the best games then, and still is now. Everything that you do really is designed for player agency. Every aspect is designed for your experience. And implemented in the highest degree such that most developers can't even come close to. I don't usually review stuff, but this really needs some good reviews now, I think.Story:This is sometiing I think the bioshocks that came after it didn't quite match. The information and details you gain from tapes is always worth the trouble taken to find them. They are spaced out perfectly, and the game creates an intrinsic desire to search for them. The events surrounding your player-character, Jack, are events you experience alongside him. And what can I say about the Little Sisters? They are a creepy and beautiful segment of the narrative.Gameplay:Guns still feel great in this game despite it feeling different from your usual FPS nowadays. It's a great feeling to ice someone, pull out a single-shot weapon and ping them right in the forehead. I found most of the plasmids very useful, and even if you don't think so there's a section of the game where it may be able to change your mind! (one of my favourite sections!).Lower your sensitivity! And I don't remember twitch-shotting being useful here, but after player hours and hours of overwatch it kind of became my default; turns out it helped when using some of the weapons.Art Direction/Graphics:The art direction is just gorgeous. Pulling off an underwater metropolis, both ruined and beautiful, full of dark theatres and rundown slums, sketchy hotels and facilites utilizing geothermal power really still has this competing with some top-tier games of this generation. It's unforunate, I think, that the ""Remastered"" graphical upgrade isn't too much over the original. Still looks amazing.Audio:This needs to be said. Audio is pretty weird. Heard a bunch of bugs were players voice lines skipped or repeated, overlapping of voice overs, high-gain voices and such. Only maybe 15% of the time, but a little...annoying that this issue is here. I also had to turn off all my EQ settings for my audio devices for it to sound like the original, except I could play the original with all these settings turned on. So this game may sound worse. Really, all of these audio problems were in the Remastered version, and none in the original. (Yes, I did test this).Technical Perforamnce:The Remastered version of the game had tonnes of flaws previously, but the damage has been somewhat mitigated by now. 1 year after release, however, I still find it inexcusable that I expect the game to crash regularly, and save religiously to mitigate the damage that what cause in terms of progress.So as of right now, here's what I can say: save, save, and save again! Save before you fight a Big Daddy, save after, save before entering significant sections of a level, etc. The game will 100% crash a number of times while you play. I lost maybe 4 hours of progress due to this, had to refight maybe 7 Big Daddys, 1 end stage and that sucked. The game, however, is soo enthralling that you'll still want to play. No ragequitting here.*note* if you experience screen-tearing or stuttering after entering a new level, Quick Save and that should fix it.Recommended?: A (hesitant) Yes. It appears many bugs have been fixed. But it's still sort of a lottery with whether or not it will work with little problems affecting your gameplay. I had a few, but the pedigree of the game pulled me through it.PC Specs:AMD Ryzen 1800xEVGA Nvidia GTX 1080 FTW32GB Corsair Vengeance DDR4 3200MHz256GB + 120 GB SSD + some HDD (the game was running off my fastest SSD)Asus Crosshair VI HeroWindows 10"

,Recommended,409710,34650764,Posted: 31 August,all,KryptixTV,"I just finished the game without any crashes or the save deletion bug. It's possible that it might be dependant on hardware so I suggest that you find a way to back up your saves because you're taking a risk playing this game. My specs are an RX 480 with a Ryzen 1600x and I was able to run this in 4k at consistent 60fps. Hopefully that helps someone out there make the decision on purchasing this on an AMD PC.The one main issue that I did have since I'm sort of an achievement hunter was that some of the achievements didn't pop up like the harvest/save all sisters and 2 of the research achievements. Basically, if you want to get 100 percent, don't even bother because this game has bugged achievements, but regardless, you still sort of want to do all research and collect all Little Sisters anyway to help out.Also, the difficulty is also bugged, in a bad way and a good way. I started this in the Survivor difficulty, but midway through, I realize the game automatically switched to Medium so I looked it up and this is a common bug. The good thing is that if you switch to Survivor difficulty right before defeating the final boss, you will still get all the difficulty achievements.It's Bioshock, it's a great game in it's core, it's the risk of the bugs that might ruin it for you. Only think you want to make sure is to back up your saves in a timely fashion. Just copy and paste them into a different folder or have an auto back up program set up if possible."
76561198087345773,Recommended,409710,34657861,Posted: 1 September,all,sunny29990,"I remember this game. I remember begging my dad to get me a new graphics card so that I could play this game as it was one of those games which only supported video cards with shader model 3.0 and i had one with a 2.0 feature. I didn't know shader models were a thing till i learned about this game.So after getting a new video card, an Nvidia 9600 GT at that time, the game ran on its fully glory and I was stunned. I am revieweing the remastered version of the game because I just finished playing it again recently and had my memories restored to me the same way they were 10 years back when I was a teenager :) ok so here goes-1-Graphics- Simply great, the underwater city of Rapture is rendered beautifully with stunning water and details. They are as good as they were 10 years back. I have to say I visually didn't notice much difference between the original version and the remastered one except for a few texture improvements and better character models. But it was a nice excuse to play the game once again and explore the world. Its lifelike and looks truly like a destroyed utopia.2-Story- I have to say this game has one of the best stories ever told in video games in 2007 and it still is. The twist is awesome and its unpredictable. The basic plot is you are Jack, a passenger on an aeroplane and your plane crashes in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean near a lighthouse. By taking shelter in the lighthouse you discover a sprawling underwater city oblivious to the rest of the world build by business magnate, Andrew Ryan, for people to be free from government control and ethics and practice their profession as they please without market restrictions. But the time you reach the city it is descented into chaos and madness and with the help of a guy named Atlas, it is your job to discover what happened to this once great city. The backstory is mostly told through audio logs and they flesh out the game characters in a great way.3- Combat- You fight the deranged people of the city known as Splicers with a large array of weapons at your disposal. But the highlight of the game is there are plasmids which provide you with unique powerups like Electricity, Fire and Telekensis etc to take down enemies using fun and exploitative ways using your left hand. There are mini boss battles in each level in the form of Big Daddies, giant humanoid like creatures with a driller or a gun in their hands through which you can find the currency known as ADAM for purchasing plasmids and their upgrades. You can also purchase ammo,food through ingame dollar currency also. You are also given a plethora of combat, physical and engineering abilties to exploit the security system of the city and turn them against the enemy and hack safes etc to loot precious stuff. Its all done great though hacking can get a little tedious after a while.4-Sound- Sound is great and in a lot of areas you can hear the old classic songs of the 40-50's which gives a great nostalfia feel. The sound of the guns and enemies are all well done.5-Remastered version-The remastered version gave us a bonus feature which is a director's commentary through which you can see the behind the scenes footage of how the developers took inspiration,envisioned and finally made the game. You can unlock it by gathering golden reels on each level, though I really wish they were unlocked by default as the reels are hard to see in the environment. Though there are a lot of guides on steam to help you out with it. There is a museum area where you can see the concept art for some enemies which were left out in the game and a bonus area mode in which you are given challenges to complete through a specific way the game tells you to do. They are all linked mainly to completing the in game achievments.Also, many people are experiencing techincal issues in running the remastered version, I hope the devs fix this. For me, I faced occassional stutters in some areas of the game however the game never crashed for me.As a fan of the System Shock series I truly loved this game and would definitely recommend it as it laid the foundation for some the games of the future.."
,Recommended,409710,34657644,Posted: 1 September,all,D.Va Degenerate,"First things first, this game tends to crash quite a bit. I haven't encountered any other glitches other than this. Though crashes tend to happen most often when saving, so if you play this game remember to save a lot so you don't lose too much progress when the inevitable crash happens.Other than that, as a newcomer to the series I feel this game didn't age too poorly. The story was interesting, and the themes were interesting. Combat is my main nitpick. It feels somewhat clunky. Graphically speaking, it still manages to hold up to modern expectations.Overall, I would recommend this game if you're willing to deal with the technical difficulties. It's worth it, I think."

While I appreciate 2K being willing to do this Remaster and charging a reasonable price for the 2, it is riddled with some extremely annoying tactics that, if you ask a fanboy, were 'implemented to prevent people from staring at a screen for too long', aka crashes. While I booted up this game (after the first Bathysphere Cutscene ended, during the save/load period) this game crashed 3 times. And it can go days with no crashes, or crash 5 times a day.

The gloomy athmosphere 60s retro vibe with stunning 3D graphic, philosophical based of Ayn Rand take on Objectivism ideas, and simple and yet challenging gameplay FPS mechanic involving arms with guns and body genetic modification where you can throw fire, ice, wind, and other things with your bare hands defeating various kind of deformed human. Bioshock 1 is where you can bring philosophical ideas into video games with perfect gameplay mechanic. And this is what I want to say for the first of paragraph of my review.PLOT :Its 1950, You are an average John who flights across the ocean where suddenly your flight got crashed and you are survivor in the middle of ocean where there is only a lighthouse that leads you into a beautiful city under the sea that is apprently all of the residents are corrupted by advanced genetic body modification and also aftermath of idealistic city built by Andrew Ryan. The man who thinks that the world dont need limitations in science advancement, art works, and also established government system.In other word, he is the one you will face and fight alongside mysteries that you have to unravel the glory days and the downfall of Rapture by finding some audio records left with help from survivor called Atlas where you communicate using radio wave to find your escape from savage modified human like residents turned into addicts for your ADAM, your genetic substance where there are two iconic ADAM hunterer like Big Daddies and Little Sister that you can fight for your own benefit by using weapons to find or using PLASMIDS that simply makes you powerful to control any substance like fire burst, electro charge, and many more to make you stronger after beating Big Daddies and later you have to choose whether to kill little sister by harvesting her ADAM, or save her where those choices it will affects your ending and also your moral compass.CONTROL :Bioshock 1 is first-person shooters where basically you can play using keyboards with mouse and also game-pad. It has smooth movement for character movement and easy to use weapon and abilty function that has less rpg mechanic and depend of looting system where you can get some money, first aid, some proper ammo to battle specific enemies by killing enemies or find those hidden on various object you can find alongside the location where you can rely on the arrow cursor to guide you. It seems easy to play, but in some encounter you have to consider and make strategy to prepare enemy attacks because every bullets counts and using your special ability what makes this game more fun, such throwing stuffs, make flammable floor or doing hack for machine that against you such as cctv and turret guns.VISUAL :The game came in 2008 and it revolutionized and introduced the new graphic of what Unreal Engine is capable of. Even though Bioshock 1 has limited area to explore, the vibe of being under the sea with astonishing landscape of Rapture city through the window makes this games has its own identity where beautifully background location setting with thrilling sense of claustrophobia. Some objects through the location such paintings, ads, and radio can be the hint and to reveal the plotline in case you miss and perfectly crafted to support your progress to understand what does it like being in Rapture city.The music and sounds effect represents of vintage feel and fits with the theme properly. The voice acting that you can hear through records and radio is top-notch and makes story more believable with key characters to give you guidance and knowledge with the setting.FUN :For a FPS fan genre, Bioshock is not average shooter that relies on the machine gun only, but it requires to use your strategy how you can use ability and makes advantage of objects such as shooting gasoline leaks with fire or electrocute water floor to make enemies more vulnerable. There are also bunch of abilities to explore to progress the game to make it easier.Bioshock has looting elements which means you can take money and particular items from enemy you kill where later you can spend on it to buy healts, eve (for using ability), bullets and explosives.Storyline wise, Bioshock 1 has more mature theme with its own objectivism philosophy without shoving theories and the game gives you the foundation and description on how Objectivism work, if you never touch the subject before. Its like the introduction to you and the aftermath if you finish the game and like the concept. You may be interested to read Atlas Shrugged and The Fountain Head just like I do.Now, would you kindly do the same?Rating 9/10 would kindly recommended."

Do not however download the remastered version, it's horrible. While I haven't encountered the saving bug it is still a bad port. Firstly, dialogue whether it's a diary or someone actually talking can sometimes loop 3 times. Weirdly enough, some cutscenes wait for the loop to finish and then continues. Despite me running the game at 144fps the game feels very laggy and nowhere near as smooth as the original BioShock. The remastered version is definitely a visible upgrade, but not worth the performance issues and possible loss of save files. Playing the original BioShock with it's textures is nicer anyway, allows me to feel as if I'm truly playing a 2007 game, a game from a gaming era I wasn't able to be apart of. Regardless, this is a must have game butDO NOTeven waste your time downloading the remastered version. I'm truly disappointed as I don't know you can ♥♥♥♥ up replacing old textures with new ones."

I highly recommend Bioshock either remastered or the normal edition as the story is really interesting, along with the location and overall gameplay. The only issue I have is the end which felt very weak compared to the rest of the game but overall it's worth getting."

However, this game was often very frustrating to play, it always felt like I had to scrounge the battlefield for ammunition and even still I was constantly running out of it, this wouldn't have been an issue if the basic enemies of the game didnt take more ammunition to kill than the hardest to kill dropped."

The game itself is brilliant with it's story, graphics and gameplay but auto saves are such a simple and vital component."
