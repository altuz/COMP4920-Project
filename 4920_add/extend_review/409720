,Recommended,409720,32511034,Posted: 17 June,all,acdcdave1387,"They finally got it working!With the December updates they finally worked out the kinks with DX11 related crashes. I read somewhere that audio reverb causes crashes so with that feature disabled I ran through the entire game as well as Minerva's Den without a single crash or problem.The mouse lag is present but people aren't realizing that this isn't so much a game development problem as it is Microsoft Windows. I can't get into the detailed explanation but some games have a strange lag or hitchyness to it despite a solid 60 FPS with v-sync enabled. Many people wonder why and attribute it to poor game code. This actually has something to do with Windows handling the fullscreen display rather than letting the game handle the fullscreen display. I know that doesn't make much sense but trust me...turn OFF v-sync in game and then go into your GPU's control panel and enable FAST v-sync there as well as triple buffering. The game will run as smooth as glass.I know this title caught a lot of flak when it released but people need to realize that what they did was done for a reason. They updated the game to DirectX11, worked out the audio issues and the strange physics issues and got it marketed to a whole new generation of consoles. This means that kids that never got to play it or never even heard of it can now play the same classics we enjoyed!They then went as far as to give this remaster out for frickin FREE to all owners of the original games...and people had the audacity to complain about it when it didn't work properly! Sure enough they came back and patched it multiple times and got it working (at least for some of us) when they didn't have to do any of that for us.For a review of the game itself, see my other review on the original title which is actually more unstable for me than the remaster."

There are more audio options than graphical options.This version is missing basic features, like an FOV slider. which was also missing in the original, however it was, and still is avaliable through flawless widescreen.All of the bugs from the original still remain, and to quote someone from Reddit: ""The only reason to remaster this game on PC was to fix technical issues and improve graphics, but they didn't even ♥♥♥♥ing bother."""

76561198026350742,Recommended,409720,32341817,Posted: 11 June,all,glumski,"I honestly liked this game a lot. Sure, I had quite a few crashes (every time after I forgot to save for a while) but this is my personal favourite of the series.In comparison to the first part not that much has changed. As the game is set in Rapture the atmosphere again is hauntingly beautiful and the art style fantastic. The water effects are truly outstanding.Like in the first part the story and characters are fantastic. Where objectivism was the ideology of BioShock 1 it's collectivism in this one, and while I usually pretty much loathe politics or sociology or whatever this game made those topics interesting for me. I'd say that the first 3/4 of the game are very similar to BS1 (annoyingly so, even) but the last part is exceptional and unique with wonderful endings. (There a three different flavours of endings (Good, Neutral and Evil) with about seven or eight different cutscenes.) The characters are astoundingly well done. Where in BS1 it felt like somewhat decent people turned into monsters thoughout the game it's the opposite here; even the bad guys turn out to be humans with their own understandable motivations. The decisions you have to make also are way more difficult and meaningful than in the first part of the series.There's one rather short sequence where you play as a Little Sister and it is breathtaking.Gameplay-wise I'd say that BS2 is a step up from BS1. It's a bit tedious at times, the weapons aren't that remarkably, the plasmids are, well, pretty much the same you already know. The one thing that annoyed me a lot was that both the hacking multitool and the camera are in the weapon wheel; quite often I accidentally selected these non-weapons during combat.Someone who likes shooters will probably appreciate the mechanics more than I did. I focused on the story and thus the gameplay wasn't that interesting to me.Minerva's Den is a worthy DLC. It took me about four hours to complete and the plot and characters are as great as in BS1 and the main part of BS2. As always there's a great plot twist in the last part and the ending was touching. I liked the art style even more than in the basegame, and that's saying something.Truth be told, I can recommend this game to anyone who likes a good story. As I have not played the original version of BS2 I can't say if it crashes more or if the changes are appropriate. I'd say that BS2 is a game you absolutely have to play if you liked BS1; I can't make a choice between the original or the remastered version though."

76561198153176634,Recommended,409720,32715157,Posted: 24 June,all,[YGS]Dies On Duty,"Another trip in the undwater city of rapture but this time it is after the ruling of Andrew Ryan and the city is falling further apart. Can this early prototype of the big daddy be reunited with his little sister? Can this game be good? To atleast answer the second question i will be going throught the game in a pro/ con style and ending with my final conclusion.Pro:Very interesting playable character. In the original bioshock we played as well some guy under a brainwashing plasmid. This time we play as a prototype big daddy called delta. Unfortunantly he is weaker than the normal big daddy's but playing as a big daddy opens up the new perspective about big daddy's.New guns. There is the obvious drill, rivet gun, and the chain gun. It is not much but there is an interesting assortment of weapons to use and the drill is pretty useful since it stun locks enemies. The weapon upgrades are two normal upgrades like power or clip size or fireing speed and the final upgrade unlocks its maximum usage. Maybe the gun sets enemies on fire if shot repeativly or electricuted with the drills tesla power.More enemies. There are a the normal splicers that return like the lead head splicer, spider splicer, ect but there are new enemies types that these hulking splicers, big sisters, alpha big daddy's, and a version of the big daddy with a shoulder mounted rocket launcher.Amazing level design. Rapture looks more ruined than before and at some moments the player can leave areas of the map and explore the bottom of the ocean for only a small bit. These moments are normally transitions between level area to level area.An enjoyable story. The game has a story that was apparent, everything being done felt like it added to the journey. The game provided moral decisions that gave the player the choice of letting this person live or die for the trouble they caused for them on the journey or because they did something horrific in the past. Through the game the player understands more about the character such as a past adding a new understanding about big daddy's.New hacking mini game. The new hacking minigame is a QTE where there is a moving pointer and the player needs to stop this pointer on the green sections or blue. It is a bit easier than the Bioshock 1 hacking minigame but also has a bit more depth too. If the player lands on the blue an added bonus will activate like for the vending machines will drop a free item or if hacking a turret; it will have added damage output.con:Big sisters. Now they are a new enemy in the game but they ware a major pain because big sisters only appear when all the little sisters have been harvested or helped. It would be better if the big sister was some type of negative consiquence for those who harvested little sisters adding challenge for the players seeking power. The issue with the way they are now; it makes the wanting of interacting with the little sisters more of a task and a peice of the game that would be avoided.The little sisters's minigame sucks. It can not be as simple as save or kill anymore. It now needs to be kill or do this slow paced escort minigame to protect the little sister scavenge for ADAM. It is not fun for how slow it is and makes going for the good ending a chore and something no one wants to do.Repetitive level progression. Normally the game is giving us a goal but once you arrive at your goal or destination. The game says that the door is locked and a detour must be taken to get an item to continue progression. Every level is the same design and it gets old and very predictable towards the end game.Conclusion:The game was a blast to play because of how well the combat was being able to use a plasmid and weapon at the same time or any other implimentations that were added to the sequel that compared to the first game is better in some area's in the sequel. Still having to deal with the big sisters was a huge pain and felt forced even when the player is working towards that good ending. The designs of how levels progress got very samey that quickly became easy to predict and annoying to experience. The Little sisters mini game was annoying to do since of how long it is and how unnessary it is. If the minigam was an option to help increase the ADAM recieved then i would be ok with it but having the kill or save choice for the start would be niece. In short the game is just ok, it has some positive stuff but the negative things deal with changes or mechanics that do not need to exist."

I've played them all at least 3 times through and would recommend them to anyone. However, I have not been able to get the remastered version of Bioshock 2 to work. There is currently a long standing bug that causes the game to crash whenever you start a new game. I have managed to play through Bioshock 1 Remastered, although it crashes randomly sometimes and will delete all but the autosave on some ocassions. Until they fix the issues (if they do) I would say hold off on buying the remastered versions and instead just play the originals because there is nothing new other than a graphics update. The series is fantastic, definitely a top 5 for me, but with the current standing of the remastered versions its not worth it."

Only this time, you were returning to Rapture as a seasoned veteren, as opposed to new player who has never seen the likes of this atmospheric game before. Which all in all is not a bad thing if you've never played Bioshock before, but if you've already played though the entire first game (like myself) then you may find this instalment lacking in creative content.That isin't to say that Bioshock 2 dosen't bring new elements to the franchise. You play as a Big Daddy, but you still get to use plasmids, which does make combat incredibly fun. No more wrench, now you have a drill. No more pistol, now you finally have one of those Rivet guns that you could never pick up or use in the first game. However, as a big Daddy you can now accompany little sisters on their harvests for extra Atom, only to either harvest or save them by the end.Bioshock 2 Remastered also comes with the Minerva's Den DLC, which I highly reccomend. It gives that Bioshock itch a good scratch by staying true to the Bioshock formula of having a mysterious plot and twist ending, but also introducing a new Big Daddy and a lovely new gun to fight it with.Bioshock 2 also introduces new enimes, like Brut Splicers, Big Sisters and a couple new Big Daddies. However in the end, a few small changes are not enough to make Bioshock 2 better the then first Bioshock game. It just dosen't have the same sense of wonder and mystery that made the first game so great. Does that mean Bioshock 2 is by any means a bad game? No. That would be like saying a 8/10 game is bad just because the previouse game was a 9/10.So do I think Bioshock 2 is better the the first Bioshock? No, I do not. Do I think you should still play it? Absolutely, It is still an engaging, enjoyable and well made FPS that is much better then so many other games on the market."

I was hoping that a patch would fix things but sadly, at the time of this review I must say that this game is still in a pretty bad state.I have an Nvidia GTX 950, a turboclocked 4.2 Gigahertz quadcore CPU, and 8 gigs of DDR3 RAM. Yet even at the lowest settings the framerate is horrible. From the load in screen and opening cinematic the FPS was 22 to 25. Once I got in game and started playing the framerate did not improve. I was not able to achieve more than 31 FPS for more than a few seconds and even dropped down to 11 FPS in a few spots with an average FPS of about 19. The original version of the game looks just about the same as this version with the exception of a little bit more shine on the water and the lighting seems to be a bit brighter and I can play that on max setting over 60 FPS. I know that I don't have an amazing computer, but for what I have and what this game delivers graphically 19 average FPS is abysmal.Stick to the original version of the game. It runs better and looks pretty much the same as the remastered version.EDIT 10/6/16Well they finally patched this game and I went from being one of the people that didn't have any crashes playing, to having the game crash everytime I try to load or start a new game. I can't get past the load screen, the game just crashes. Thanks 2K for ""Fixing"" this for me...If that's not bad enough after the first crash everything on my monitor was extremely bright. The game must have changed the settings on my monitor.EDIT AGAINOK so I tried to fix the changes done to my monitor from the game. I restarted my computer, and reset the monitor settings to factory. (Which is what they were set at the begin with) The brightness sill persists and any thing that I try to change doesn't effect the problem. It's like applying a filter over it but not changing the brightness. My Steam window, which is normally gray, is black. That's how bad this game has broken my monitor. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!

,Recommended,409720,34023566,Posted: 4 August,all,mobobber,"Overall, Bioshock 2 is not as good as BioShock 1 or BioShock Infinite. The storyline is simply not as captivating. The game is also a bit shorter than BioShock 1, and it's less challenging. However, some parts of BioShock 1 felt unfairly difficult, while BioShock 2 doesn't have any areas that are unfair.BioShock 2 did improve on its predecessor in a few ways. I didn't encounter any technical issues at all in this game. It ran at over 60 FPS the whole time, and it never crashed, which was not the case for BioShock 1 (although there was only 1 particular area where FPS dropped in BioShock 1, and that game only crashed 3 or 4 times total for me). Also, I really liked that you can use a gun and a plasmid at the same time, and as a result of this, I used plasmids a lot more often than I did in BioShock 1. The gunplay felt more polished and the guns themselves were better than BioShock 1's. For example, the drill was more satisfying than the wrench, the rivet gun was better than the pistol, the machine gun was better than the submachine gun, and the shotgun was better, too. However, BioShock 2 doesn't have a chemical thrower, my favorite weapon in BioShock 1.Despite the couple of improvements, the storyline is simply less engaging than the story in BioShock 1, and that's what makes it less good. The BioShock games tend to rely on having a strong story, since the actual gameplay isn't as strong as other FPS games."

You can also access with tab the console commands which will allow you to set the FOV to whatever you please.This Game is in all honesty very beautiful in its own unique way.

Bioshock 2 was no disappointment. It takes place in an awesome city called ""Rapture"" and the atmosphere of the game ist excellent.

I still prefer the original ever so slightly but I loved my time with this second run through in rapture.2) This remastered version is a total mess. When I first installed I had no audio. When I managed to get that fixed the game crashed about every 30 mins (CTD). Then the game was patched and now it crashes every 5-10 mins.

Being able to play it!""Despite this ""remaster"" aiming to update the graphics, patch bugs, and make the game run better, you'll have a Hell of a time trying to even get the game to start up. Sure, you may get past the main menu, but if you try to actually play the game, it just crashes to desktop. I'm not the only person with this issue. Several people can't get the game to work at the time of this writing. If you can get the game to run properly, you'll notice that the gamer doesn't really look all that different. Sure, maybe there's better lighting and water effects, but not much else. And unlike Bioshock 1, which included Commentary by Ken Levine, plus all the content initially exclusive to the Playstation 3 port, this remaster actually REMOVES content, specifically the Multiplayer. The one positive thing I can say is that the game generally has a higher framerate than the original version, but that's it. Until Take-Two patches the many issues in this Remaster, I cannot recommend it, which is a shame because I genuinely think BioShock 2 is a great game. Until they patch it, just play the orignal version."

Nowadays it looks like they released a patch or something though, because I got to finish it - obviously, or I wouldn't be here writing a review.Recommended if you've played and enjoyed ""BioShock"".

,Recommended,409720,26342815,"Posted: 31 October, 2016",all,crowbar,"RATING: 10/10For most people it's either Bioshock 1 or Bioshock Infinite, but for me it is Bioshock 2. I don't understand why that is, but my best guess is that at first Bioshock 2 couldn't impress people as much as the first game due to the fact that it's set at the exact same location and with the same graphics engine. Bioshock Infinite is completely different and also way more spectacular, so I guess it is also appealing to the casual audience. And surely Elizabeth is a big reason why people like Infinite so much, even though I personally don't like her that much.Bioshock 2 perfected Bioshock 1's gameplay, while Bioshock Infinite took out multiple aspects. Bioshock 2 streamlined the gameplay without sacrifing complexity, while Bioshock Infinite removed most of it. The reason why Bioshock 2 is so good is probably because it is set in the same location with the same graphics engine as the original. That means they could reuse a lot of assets and already had a fully functional engine, where they probably made small adjustments and improvements.The most obvious change is that you can use your weapons and plasmids at the same time, which was a problem in the first game where it could get very fiddely when swapping between weapons and plasmids. But this also is just much more satisfieing gameplay, because when you shoot bullets and electricity at the same time, you feel much more powerful. It also encourages a lot more experimentation, because now you have to decide what weapon and plasmid to use at the same time, and there are a lot of combinations.They also revamped the plasmids themselves. In the first game there was some redundancy which they worked on, and they removed the gene tonic types. Now all gene tonics share the same type. This allows for much more experimentation and customization. Because they also added a lot more gene tonics to the game, they could also spread them more in the game world itself, instead of forcing the player to buy them from gatherers' gardens, which makes exploration much more rewarding.What I love the most is how they improved the upgrade system. In Bioshock 1 upgrading plasmids only made it do more damage, but here the plasmids gain new abilites. With the first upgrade some plasmids become area of effect attacks. With the second upgrade you can hold the button to continually fire the plasmid, like a flamethrower, which is really fun and satisfieing to do. And remember, you do that while you are shooting at the same time. And there are a lot more weapon upgrade stations now and weapons have 3 upgrade instead of 2 where the third is a special upgrade you can only get after getting the first two.The game also offers tons of variety. Every level introduces at least one new element. A new primary plasmid, a new big enemy type, a new weapon, most of the time all those things simulatneously, but there are a lot of surprises as well! The new additions like the new Big Daddy and the fact that you are playing as a prototype big daddy also make a lot of sense. And things like that get explained in the audio logs, which are completely uneccessary if you just want to experience the main plot, but great if you want to learn more about the world and understand why some things are the way they are.Why do Big Daddys protect Little Sisters so hard? What happened with Big Daddy experimentation after Suchong's death? What was Sofia Lambs role in relation to Andrew Ryan? I really wish Andrew Ryan didn't die in Bioshock 1, because it would be amazing to see both characters at the same time, debating with each other, just implied by some audio logs.Oh and Sofia Lamb, WOW! What a villain. I love her. She is really evil, but not just ""evil"", she is this super smart, super manipulative strong woman, where if she talks to you, you don't know what to think anymore. She is a terrible human being, but when she appears in the game you don't think ""not her again!"", you think ""yes! This will be a great moment!"". A big part of that is her voice actress, who did a phenomenal job, Sofia Lamb is easily one of the best female characters of all time, which isn't saying that much since there aren't a lot of well written female characters anyway ;)Some people say Bioshock 2's story doesn't work as well as the first, but in my opinion Bioshock 2 does a great job with the story, especially with how it recaps the decisions the player made. Throughout the game the child you are supposed to protect is watching you, so every decision you make she will witness, and as a child that doesn't know the world yet and for who you are the biggest role model, those decisions will shape her, and lead to one of the multiple endings. The decisions aren't so black and white as in the first game neither.Don't get me wrong. I love the original Bioshock and I still like Infinite, but Bioshock 2 is the pinnacle of the Bioshock series in my opinion. It is a nearly flawless game."

,Recommended,409720,26191405,"Posted: 23 October, 2016",all,"Communist ""Joseph Ballin"" Layton","Bioshock 2 got a bit of a mixed reception when it released, for good reason. It's shorter than Bioshock 1, you can't backtrack to get things you missed, the EVE hypos and health packs are more limited and less useful (you can't reload your plasmids manually, for example), and I'm sure most people who have played it agree that one of the moral choices is a little questionably moral. The game tends to assume that the player is an idiot, like having a door with the code written on the window display the code on a little piece of paper when you go to the keypad in case you somehow missed it, or the game introducing Sophia Lamb like three times to you, or explaining what hacking a door does every time you hack a door. And unlike the first game where everything in the world felt like it had a place in it, Bioshock 2 tends to feel a little gamey - why does a Big Daddy need to use a weapons upgrade station, and why would they even make those stations be able to upgrade those weapons? Why is Delta just able to use the gene modification that lets him restore little sisters for no explainable reason? How does he eat potato chips with that helmet on? In terms of the remaster, the game is more stable than Bioshock 1's remaster, but also lacks the bonus features like the developer commentary tracks.At the same time, looking back, I think we didn't know how good we had it. At least Bioshock 2 wasn't a series of linear corridors. At least hacking wasn't turned into an automatic plasmid. At least the weapons were fun to use, and still allowed you to set up traps and plan things out and gave you reasons to bother doing so. At least the world still felt a little bit alive, and didn't present you with a world where you were the only thing that mattered and every living creature existed to live and breathe wanting you dead. By now some of you are probably looking at Bioshock Infinite in your steam library with the same sense of regret that I do. Instead, Bioshock 2 took a familiar great game and played it a little safe, adding some nice new features like dual-wielding plasmids and guns while keeping the overall formula pretty similar. You don't get the bonus challenge maps that Bioshock 1 had, but in its place you get Minerva's Den, a generally praised side story DLC. And while Sophia Lamb ultimately isn't really as good of a character as Andrew Ryan and nothing quite tops an evening with Sander Cohen, Bioshock 2 still has a fair amount of memorable characters in its cast. Is Bioshock 2 as good as Bioshock 1? No, but at least it's not as boring as Bioshock Infinite, and I think that's what really counts."

Most of these are really jarring and I simply do not understand how these could pass quality control, assuming there was any QC.It is infuriating to know that almost six years after the initial release, we are getting a version that has fewer graphical options than the original version. While I appreciate the revamped textures and the somewhat modified lighting, it is unacceptable for a 2016 release to force users to fiddle in the .ini files for an ideal experience. Want to have a wider FOV? Assign a key to it in the .ini file. Want to use an EVE Hypo when your EVE meter is at half but your item slot is full? Assign a key to it in the .ini file.But there is more than just some graphical settings. I experienced framerate drops in areas that have been traversed multiple times on my medium-end machine (i5-3470 with a GTX 1060), frequent crashes to desktop that I sadly cannot count on one hand and even stumbled upon corrupted save games twice during my playthrough. Essentially, the game would fail to save my game, display none of my saved games, so while the game was running, I had to alt+tab and make a copy of my save game folder and then remove the original folder. And this is what you call a remaster?Thankfully, the latest patch has since fixed the FOV problem and added some graphical settings (though it removed my ability to assign a key to use up an EVE Hypo and the crashes were still frequent) but ultimately, these versions were rushed and not tested properly. Sure, I got it for free since I had the original versions but the consumers that had to buy it got a product which was almost inferior to the few-years-old initial release. Shady business practice indeed, though I guess these remasters were aimed at the console users."

The crashes in this are very, very frequent. Enough to simply ruin any sort of immersion or enjoyment. Going through a single level I got maybe 4 or 5 crashes. Whenever or if this gets patched to fix the crashes, I shall reconsider this aspect of the review.As to the game itself, Bioshock 2, as a sequel to the first one, was rather good. The gunplay, plasmids and some mechanics are much improved and a lot more fun and intense. Each level feels a lot more more contained on itself in a hub-ramifications format if compared to Bioshock 1 given how you, as a big daddy, collect adam: Instead of saving the little sister immediately you have a chance to escort her around, collecting adam, to maximize your profit.The plot isn't very straightforward in the beginning but about halfway into the story character development starts making sense of things that previously were a bit more open to interpretation.Overall I'd give this a 7,5/10. Get it if you really enjoyed the first one but avoid like the plague until a crash-fixing patch drops."

Having said that this game is playable IF you DO NOT have the spacebar crashes. A gamble to be sure...They say the game crashes after a few hours but I never had it crash once(after Bioshock 1 remastered I learned it crashed every 2 hours so I would take a break every hour and just reboot the game). Inconvenient but playable. Now if you love to hunt achievements(albeit a hunter or just like to 100% your favorite games)...this is not a wise purchase until patched. Many of the achievements(that take the longest to complete, of course) are broken such as 100 diaries, every PttP upgrade station, collect 600 ADAM from Little Sisters, hack 30 machines from a distance, etc. Now this isn't a huge problem for me because I like the game regardless and achievements aren't that big of a deal to me but it was smooth for me. Sadly, I cannot recommend this game because of the glitches and the hassle new players would have to go through to play this version(even the original on Steam I had to use a fix just to play it and it would crash sometimes).

When I saw that they had remastered these games, I was very excited to play them. However, I noticed that the reviews on this game were much different than on the original. I thought that maybe they all had bad PC's or something. (kind of rude, now that I think about it) But all of them were right.BioShock 2 Remastered is perhaps one of the buggiest games that I have ever played. And after seeing my game crash over and over again, I was very disappointed with this. One of my favorite games of all time was remade, and all it does is crash every 5-10 minutes.To summarize, the gameplay and graphics are outstanding, but you can barely experience it with all the crashing. It pains me to give a BioShock game a negative review. So please, for your own sake, play the original BioShock 2 instead. The graphics will not be as good, but at least it won't crash all the time.Once again, I'm very sad about this, and I hope that it will be fixed, so that I may rewrite this review."

Now have to fight her again. As much as I want people to check out Bioshock, being unable to do it without a bunch of crashes would just ruin the experience and probably frustrate even the calmest person.Update: So I went back to the game and somehow bypassed a crash, then I had more crashes related to saving my game. I finished the level without saving and that was sorted out. On the next level I spent a lot of time exploring the levels, trying to get every possible achievement, then got to the next Big Sister fight. I died a few times, so I saved my game to try it again later. Now loading the saved game and doing anything for a few seconds crashes the game again. This happened over 10 times. I'm really close to abandoning the series for good, because while I know the original Bioshock 2 is reported to be way more stable, I don't want to start over and work for those achievements and collectibles.

,Recommended,409720,34909061,Posted: 12 September,all,z4nid,"In Bioshock 2, former city council member Dr Sophia Lamb takes over Rapture 10 years after Bioshock 1, and continues the experiments on Big Daddies/Little Sisters.The context is pretty original, it's based on theories that all social pathology is traced back to the single ego of each individual member of society. She argues that capitalism is the culmination of social individualism, because the economy generates value based in a notion of exclusivity, rooted in ego. Rapture under Ryan being the culmination of capitalism, would be the culmination of egocentric society.She argues that capitalism glorifies individual ego mirrored in a notion of success propagated by the American Dream, and that the pursuit of happiness is just a front to justify our own desires. To free humanity from poverty, suffering and inequality, one has to let go of their own ego completely.Rapture itself turns into a social experiment to refine this theory, to reshape humanity into this vision of ""Utopia"". You as the failed product of a bigone age, is the only one standing against her.It's actually amazing to see the many similarities it has with Bioshock 3. Sadly, the game is nerfed in many aspects, the campaign is the shortest of all 3 games, the original crafting system is completely scrapped, and the main lore is just so scattered in the form of monologues, that you simply can't be bothered to look for them all to form a coherent picture.So a few poor choices in gameplay design, and a very lousy presentation of the story made Bioshock 2 the worst one in the series. At least it worked to inspire Bioshock 3 not just in theme but the final version in the way plasmids/vigors are used in the game actually debuted in Bioshock 2."

The story is rich, the combat is satisfying. Everything you need for a good BioShock game. Even multiplayer in the non-remastered version. However, I do have a few nitpicks with this game, although I still recommend it.For one: the combatI did say that the combat in BS2 is good, and I stand by that. But it feels like some weapons are either underpowered or not emphasized. A good example of this is the spear gun. Essentially a sniper rifle, the speargun is a long-range weapon that does good damage but has a small clip. The problem I have with this is that 90% of the combat in BioShock 2 is close-ranged, so it is pretty useless. The camera is also bad. Instead of simply photographing your foes for research, you have to photo them and then attack them within a set period of time. The plasmids now have alternate abilities, and some are pretty good. But some, like 'Eruption!' for 'Incinerate!' seem really bad and drain your EVE like a frickin' hose.For two: the little sister system.This is what annoys me most about this game. In order to get the most ADAM out of a single little sister, you have to:1) Kill the big daddy protecting it2) either adopt or harvest it. For the most ADAM, adopt.3) Follow the sister's commands to the nearest ADAM-filled corpse. Proceed to place her down and get attacked by waves of splicers.4) Repeat one to two more times. When done, place the little sister in the vent for ADAM or harvest her for more ADAM.5) Do this procedure for EVERY LITTLE SISTER IN THE LEVEL.6) When you put the last little sister in her vent/harvested her, a VERY POWERFUL ENEMY will come after you called a Big Sister, a plasmid-wielding, extremely agile Big Daddy. Although she does drop ~40 ADAM, the ammo and EVE shots/health packs consumed doesn't seem worth it.7) Repeat steps 1-6 for almost EVERY LEVEL IN THE GAME.Regardless of these things, I still love this game and think you should get it and its DLC, but try to do it when it's on sale"

Again you find yourself in the hellhole of Rapture but this time you play as a Big Daddy named Subject Delta one of the first Big Daddies designed to protect the Little Sisters and his goal through the game is to find his original Little Sister . The game like the original has a spooky vibe and a beautiful story with a few shocking moments and unexpected ones .  Plasmids and gene's are back and improved in BioShock 2 and they are really fun to use , also you have more free will with your genes in BioShock 2 unlike the original where you could only use a few genes in each category in BioShock 2 you have one big gene tab . The weapons are also fun to use and you  have a wide range of them but I mostly prefer the drill .

So, No, I do not recommend the pc game itself. I can't even get passed the first load screen and perhaps some people have had better luck, Personally I recommend that you hold of and  wait until there is a patch that has gaurenteed the game will function properly, as for now, a patch was supposed to have already fixed this issue and it hasn't.Unless you want to spend a moderate amount of time searching and altering the game files, Do not buy this game yet."

I installed the original and this remaster at the same time, compared the first hour of gameplay, and noticed many of the low resolution textures have gotten an upgrade. I was actually surprised how many low-res textures the original Bioshock 2 has (despite it's overall beauty). To name a few examples, the global lighting, coral, gold doors/accents, floor, rocks, furniture, ocean objects, weapons, etc. are all much better in the remaster. I say this because some people say it's not a visual improvement (judging by comparison videos) but you really have to install both games and walk up close to every type of object to see what I mean.As for the stability issues, I have had no problems yet, but I am not that far in. I'll have to update this part of the review after I complete the game. I did however complete the Bioshock Remaster before starting this one and I experienced far less technical issues than most; I was happy overall with that one.

The biggest difference between BioShock 1 and BioShock 2 is the change to the hacking mini-game:  now, it's a mindless muscle-twitch activity instead of the ""make a tube"" activity of before.

Eagerly anticipating updates to stabilize the ""remaster""The current state of the game is embarassing considering it is supposed to be a ""remaster"" yet the original is far superior in every sense. Shame that the remaster is really dragging down one of the better game franchise of the decade in both gameplay and plotwise.Let's start with with the obvious lack of option in graphics, with the only (significant) options you can tweak are the resolution and aliasing. To add on , there are barely any options to change from really. To be honest, I would have overlooked the settings side if the game it self was able to, at the very least, run smoothly or at least the same level as the original. I was left dissapointed.Game started well, graphics were great, then the moment I reached a new area/ cutscene, well that's the end of the positive vibes I had. Alot of compability issues, the game freezes between new areas and when rendering enemies, makes it unbareable to play. I just stopped playing cause there's no point in playing a broken ""remaster"" when the original is far better.I'm expecting updates to come soon to patch these issues or else I'll be sticking with the original cause it can actually run smoothly.

,Not Recommended,409720,33498280,Posted: 13 July,all,MoneyofFools,"Bioshock 2 is a game that didn't need to exist, but I am glad it does. 2K Marin created a follow-up that manages to upstage the original Bioshock in nearly every way. The clunky combat of the first game is overhauled, giving encounters an improved pace and players far more options. Environments are appreciably larger than the cramped corridors of the first Bioshock, with the added bonus of higher fidelity visuals and prop density. Even the narrative has higher emotional stakes due to interactions with various NPCs that possess believably complex motivations.My only qualm with Bioshock 2 is that little effort is made to fill in backstory. Brand new players or those returning after a hiatus will be utterly lost. Much of the lore from Bioshock is essential to understanding the passage of time leading to Bioshock 2, meaning a thorough playthrough of Bioshock is required.As with Bioshock Remastered, I caution against playing this updated version. Developer Blind Squirrel Games put nominal effort into reworking Bioshock 2. Other than adding settings for modern displays and tweaking textures, there is nothing substantial here. In fact, just looking at the Steam forums reveals a number of issues exclusive to the remaster. Crashes, game breaking bugs, and lost saves are common. Since Bioshock 2 Remastered comes with a copy of the original Bioshock 2, play that instead.---My SpecsGPU - GTX 1070 (SLI Disabled)CPU - i7 6700kRAM - 16GBsStorage - NVMe SSDOS - Windows 10My Graphics SettingsResolution - 2560 x 144016x Anisotropic Filtering100 FOVDefault Mouse Cursor ScaleFullscreenVertical Sync - OFFAntialiasing - OFFReal-Time Reflections - ONWater ripple - ONMaintain UI Aspect Ratio - OFFExtra EnhancementsReshade 3.0for SMAA injection and image sharpening.My ExperienceUnlike Bioshock Remastered, third party programs played nicely with Bioshock 2 Remastered.

,Not Recommended,409720,25700213,"Posted: 25 September, 2016",all,Tomato Six,"First, let me say the following in all fairness: 2K tried. No matter what the final outcome, for better or for worse, they tried to make a good game. And in many ways, they did good work on this title. The combat actually feels better than in the original Bioshock, being more fluent and giving you more options. Hacking has been significantly improved as you no longer have to play a mini game endlessly to get it to work. Saying that a quick time event actually improved this issue sounds odd, but I assure you, it is true.The game also looks stunning. Rapture is simply gorgeous in Bioshock 2. A clear step above from its predecessor in that aspect as well. So visually and mechanically speaking, the game is just fine. If those are the things that are important to you in Bioshock game, I have nothing negative to report to you about Bioshock 2. Unfortunately, the most important parts of any Bioshock game for me, personally, are the characters and the story. And that regard, Bioshock 2 falls flat on its big dumb face.First off, let's consider the character you play. Supposedly, you are prototype Big Daddy who was forgotten in the bowels of Rapture until you are reactivated and asked to help out. So right off the bat, Bioshock 2 feels like a lazy fan game. You aren't really a character the way you were in the other two games. You are merely a prop that lumbers from place to place while being asked ""Isn't it so cool that you get to be a Big Daddy"" in the most pandering way possible.Playing as Jack in Bioshock or Booker DeWitt in Bioshock Infinite just felt right. It felt like you were playing a key figure and participant in the ongoing narrative. Playing a supposed Big Daddy in Bioshock 2 feels downright silly. For one thing - as the great Ben ""Yahtzee"" Croshaw rightly pointed out - you aren't really a Big Daddy.As a ""Prototype"", you can now move at normal speed, use weapons and even Plasmids. So basically, you are a Big Daddy in look only. In function, you may as well be anyone. Moreover, being asked to believe you are a prototype Big Daddy raises the question of why the Big Daddy designers stripped the ability to move normally, use weapons and use Plasmids out of the later models, replaced with simply being able to lumber around at a slow pace and punch things with your drill. The answer is, they wouldn't do that. It's all the worst kind of shoehorning in for the sake of player convenience.The whole concept of playing a prototype Big Daddy just feels wrong. Rather than feeling like a key figure in the narrative, you feel more like a ""Thing"" that the designers let you play because Big Daddy + Popular = Delta. Moreover - as Yahtzee also noted - while the designers forced you to lumber around as a supposed Big Daddy, they kept all the game mechanics from the first Bioshock the same. So just as you could as Jack in Bioshock, you can still find candy bars and bags of chips to eat and regain health. But whereas Jack had an actual mouth that wasn't obscured by anything, as a Big Daddy I guess you're cramming it all through your face plate? o_ONever has a concept felt so tacked on as the notion of playing a Big Daddy. It adds nothing to the narrative and only serves to make you feel a bit stupid as the details noted above begin to erode the immersion.Another big problem with the narrative has to do with the people you encounter in Rapture this time around. The characters you met in Bioshock were vivid, three dimensional people who were as unforgettable as Rapture itself. Who could forget Doctor Steinman's cries of frustration as he couldn't seem to get his latest surgery victim to come out just right while noting the backdrop of all his previous victims? Who could forget Sander Cohen's blatant disregard for poor, poor Fitzpatrcik as he blew him up for not playing his piano solo in tune?The problem with Bioshock 2 is that at the end of the first Bioshock, every interesting character in Rapture was either dead or gone (depending on how you play. If you have enough mercy and forgiveness in your heart, you can let the sick ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sander Cohen live). So with the exception of Tenenbaum - who serves as mere cameo in this one - 2K was forced to come up with their own characters from scratch. The result is the most unforgettable bunch I've ever met in a video game. There is a significant lack of meaning that anyone in Rapture has in this game. The characters in Bioshock all represented something that tied in to the narrative of Objectivism and its ideals. Doctor Steinman represented the medical practice unbound by the limitations of the Hippocratic oath. Cohen represented art as unrestrained by regulation, censorship or basic human decency.But - for example - In Bioshock 2, you meet Simon Wales... who designed Rapture. ... ... I'm not sure what he's supposed to represent aside from ""The guy who designed Rapture"". And that's really the crux of my problem with the narrative in Bioshock 2. Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite were all about concepts that were bigger than the games themselves. Bioshock 2 is just a game about Bioshock. And that holds no interest for me.But now we come to perhaps my biggest problem with the whole thing: Sophia Lamb. This lazy pile of main villain garbage is one of the worst Ret-Cons I've seen crammed into any video game or indeed in any form of entertainment period. This character just doesn't fit in the world of Rapture. And that's even just when the game gets started. To say nothing about the game trying to make us accept that she had been there the whole time in Bioshock, yet was never mentioned once.Everyone we encountered in Bioshock had a reason to be there. They were all attracted to Rapture in some way because Ryan's ideals and ideas freed them from basic sociological constraints, and they all ran amok as a result. There is no reason in the world why a character like Sophia Lamb would even want to go to a place like Rapture. There was nothing for her down there. And to suggest that she wanted to try and influence Rapture's ideals to her way of thinking and change that world from within is simply laughable, because it would have been such an impossible uphill battle that she - in reality - wouldn't even have bothered.And it adds tragic insult to injury when we are asked to believe that Andrew Ryan actually challenged Sophia Lamb to a public debate wherein both argued their philosophies back and forth to one another. No. I'm sorry. Just - No. Andrew Ryan would never - EVER give legitimacy and/or equal time to someone with Lamb's ideals! Let alone publicly! Someone who was that much an affront to everything Rapture and Ryan stood for would simply have been dealt with. Not debated.There's also an inherent laziness to the very concept of Sophia lamb as the villain. It's as if she was created in a 2K board meeting where someone said ""What was Andrew Ryan again? Objectivist and quasi-libertarian? Well just make this villain whatever that isn't. Cult leader and pseudo-communist? Sure, there we go, whatever"". And then slapped all those traits onto her like a half written bumper sticker. We saw something similar to those opposing traits in in Bioshock Infinite, but Comstock, Columbia and its ideals were all a contrast to Rapture, Andrew Ryan and Objectivism. Sophia Lamb is just the opposite of what Andrew Ryan was. So whereas these similar ideas were ambitious in Infinite, they're simply lazy in Bioshock 2.It all comes across as the laziest kind of fan fiction. And that's exactly what Bioshock 2 feels like: A fan game. If you play this game for mere enjoyment, than it's perfectly serviceable and certainly fun. At least at times. But the narrative is so broken and stupid that it just isn't worth playing for me, and it isn't even worthy of considering it a legitimate entry into the Bioshock world at all. It's the Star Trek V of Bioshock games. Personally, I don't even count it."

While gameplay was more or less the same, the story that they came up with was as interesting as it was engaging. I felt very satisfied with the amount of gameplay (about 8-10 hours), where I was content with the story ending when it did but also at a point where I was not sick of the game and just wanted it to end. I actually feel like playing through the game (taking different actions this time too). Now while the graphics where more like the first Bioshock that didnt bug me. I liked the look of rapture and this gave me more of the same. I didnt feel like I was playing a different game, I in fact liked the idea of being able to play Bioshock then start playing Bioshock 2 right away and feel like Im still in the same decaying city of Rapture. I dont see why a game series always has to up the graphics in each game to the point where there is a significant difference. Now I see it as a good thing if theres a significant difference between games but we see games from other companies (IE valve) where continiuing with the same graphics really give you sense of the environment. Now I also see it as a good idea to update when you change that environment such as with Bioshock Infinite. There was a few story elements that I didnt like but not to the point that it bothered me. But I really liked how you learn more about Rapture and they even tied in the main character from Bioshock. I went in expecting a game similar yet different from Bioshock, and I got that and more."

Great improvement of graphics compared to orginial, and indeed have been re-worked, and done well, Highly recommend this game.Added 5/14/17: Played DLC Minerva's Den, to end, with no crashes, graphics as with game are great for its age, story line for DLC although short and not done as well as main game,is still enjoyable and worth playing."

Glad I was able to get the remastered for free since I don't see too much of a differnce, but my experince has been flawless so far.  No crashes or any save problems (It's Bioshock so I save frequently anyways).A couple cons that shoukdn't be a deterent from buying, but are just very annoying:- Limited graphic options.  If you have trouble running it, then you are out of luck becasue there are 0 graphic options in the already small setting pool.-Aim assist is always on. And it isnt a light aim lock, no.  Its a full aim lock to te head, possess your mouse kind of aim assist.  There were sometimes where my mouse would flick to a wall.  turns out there were enemies there.  Also sometimes it wants to be on for hours at a time, then other times it chooses not to do anything.There is a way to turn off the aim assist in the game filesEDIT: Now that i have beaten the game for the first time, I can no longer recommend it.  While I had no troubled with the remastered side of it, the story Irked me.  after LOVINg Bioshock one and Infinite, I was expecting another mind-blowing experience, but all I got was disapoinment.  It is basically a more grindy cop-paste of the first game with a shallow story, weak antagonist, and unexpistant protagonist.  If you expect some shocking, jaw-dropping plot twist at the end like the other games, don't  There isn't one.  Just ripping that band-aid off now.  Truley the worst of the Bioshock games."

The story is kind of predictable though. There isn't a major plot twist or surprise ending. Played through the perspective of Big Daddy, you are the resurrected father (Grimes) of Eleanor. 10 years ago, you were made to kill yourself through mind control and now you have been resurrected by your daughter to try and save her from the clutches of Dr Lamb. In the now corrupted city of Rapture, you have to fight your way to your daughter and rescue her. Along the way, you will meet Little Sisters who sniff out the ADAM in people and go around extracting them. You have to make choices along the way, choosing either to kill or spare the lives of the Little Sisters and others that you will meet. All of these choices will affect the ending and what Eleanor will do.Conclusion, this is definitely much better than Mass Effects dry choices but slightly less interesting than Deus Ex. The binary options (either A or B) make it kind of dull and easy to anticipate. Try this game for its story mostly.PROS1.

,Recommended,409720,30246232,Posted: 28 February,all,Masa,"After my very disappointing experience with the remastered version of the original Bioshock, Bioshock 2 Remastered was a much smoother experience. I only had a single crash during my playthrough and encountered just a few minor bugs and glitches along the way. Apart from the broken audio mixing it is a solid enough remaster, although it does little to improve the graphics or the gameplay of the original Bioshock 2.Bioshock 2 is a sequel that plays things reasonably safe. You return to Rapture again but this time around as a Big Daddy. Overall this doesn't change the core gameplay much, however. Your weapons are certainly different (even if they still serve similar functions) and there are a few underwater sections mixed in, but the developers could have done a bit more to make you feel like a hulking Big Daddy instead of a more typical first person shooter hero.The sequel does improve gameplay and especially combat quite a bit, at least. You can now have a plasmid and a weapon equipped at the same time and this is welcome change indeed. The combat is now much more enjoyable and you can now easily use plasmids and weapons in interesting combinations. The new plasmid upgrades are more interesting too and the new hacking minigame is a large improvement.The writing and the story on the other hand are quite a bit weaker in Bioshock 2. Rapture is still a great setting and the game has some nice levels, but most of the new characters aren't particularly interesting and the story is rather average. The ending of the original Bioshock was written in a way that doesn't really support a direct sequel and consequently the whole setup here feels rather artificial.The game also features way too many ADAM harvesting sequences. The original only had one of these, but here they are quite common and not particularly fun. Quite a few other annoying gameplay elements make their return too, including respawning enemies and Vita-Chambers.Despite its flaws Bioshock 2 Remastered is still a rather enjoyable experience with a great setting. I'd recommend it to fans of single-player shooters, especially if you haven't played the original Bioshock 2.I played through the game on hard and found the difficulty level pretty good overall. The last few levels are rather easy, however, as many of the level 3 plasmids are seriously overpowered.The good:- Great setting- Good variety of different weapons, powers and upgrades- Rewards exploration- Fun combat- Remaster was a free update for the owners of original Bioshock 2- Minerva's Den is a very solid DLC pack (see my separate review)The bad:- Tedious ADAM harvesting sections- Vita-Chambers remain a terrible gameplay mechanic- Overused audio-logs- Pointless wallet cap- Clunky plasmid UI and other menus- Respawning enemiesThe ugly:- Looks pretty much exactly the same as the original despite the remastering- Few mission scripting bugs- Some graphics glitches- Terrible audio mixing"

Even though it's nice seeing this remastered  as well, there are far too many bugs. Textures are just thrown around everywhere, they even collide with each other. I even saw big daddy with a bench stuck in his head with the bars popping out like they shouldn't be there. Graphically, this is not enjoyable like the original.I had a smooth run until I ventured into Pauper's Drop, Siren Alley, (Parts of Dionysus Park) and a bit with the house that's upside down. There were loads of crashes but I made it.The sound was either too low or too high. Jukeboxes are soooo low. For such an amzing soundtrack, we didn't get the deluxe package. :/ There was even a part I could hear constant wet stepping sounds, continued until I concluded the stage.Achievments, for a game that had a perfect transitioning with this in the Xbox, PS, and Windows versions. This one def had/has some problems. Quite a few of these are broken. More specifically:Master Gatherer (Everyone should be able to get this, that is if they don't harvest the slug)Research Master (100% on 9 subjects. broken.)All Weapon Upgrades (Every secrect spot, even verified with guides, broken.)Look at You, Hacker ( As a master hacker with bots, man was I depressed when this one didn't pop up)Rapture Historian (This is def broken, even with using a 100% guide or even just literally playing the orginalnear 10 times with a perfect list of recordings.)At this juncture. I cannot recommend this verison of the game to anyone, however as it's free to anyone with a copy of the originals via buying this, well that's a mixed view.

Dual wielding a plasmid and a weapon felt natural and seamless, made the combat flow more nicely. Also just the small gameplay touches to improve the pacing from the original like changing the hacking mini game to a much better one that doesn’t interrupt gameplay as well as the research camera changing from taking pictures to recording which also helps the pacing of the fights. It feels like the developers took the core gameplay of the original and tried to improve on every aspect of it and they have succeeded in my opinion. The reason why it’s not a better game than the original is because it doesn’t leave the same impact that the original did with it’s story and the memorable and creative level design. Bioshock 2 has a bit of a been there done that feel to it which is fine because I love the setting of the game and want more of it but there is no sense of mystery and wonder that the original had.

Interesting perspective, frustrating method of gathering Adam, at least if you want to save the Little Sisters.This time around, you're able to dual wield a weapon and a plasmid, which creates some nice fights overall. You've got some new weapons in your arsenal - even though the majority is the same as in the first Bioshock game. There's the ability to ""hack"" devices (turrets, cameras etc.) and turn them against the enemy. But in the bigger picture, it's mostly the same as before, which is a good thing.The graphics hasn't really changed, it's the same ""old"" dark, gritty, Rapture. The sounds are the same. The music is still as good. The gameplay is first person shooter with light RPG elements and also some horror at that. It's probably quite obvious, but the story isn't the same (duh!)... and I have to say, the story is quite... not bad, but not as good as in the first game. The ending felt lackluster, there were no real boss battles, making certain choices made no difference. But I still wanted to find Eleanore and save her, no matter the cost. So that was what kept me going.My verdict is that I do recommend this game, but if you decide on not playing it (after Bioshock 1), you're not really missing out either.

However, you find out a lot of new information and playing as a Big Daddy does change some elements. The story's not as good as the first one, you just don't have that sense of discovery and the compelling features of the first game. To be honest, this feels almost like a post-game DLC, instead of a game on it's own.Definitely not as interesting or engaging as the first one, but all the same elements are there and the plasmids are always great fun. It's still a great game and I enjoyed it. The ending is very rewarding."

I suppose that's true; the combat's cleaner, the enemies more varried, and you're not actively rewarded for not upgrading your plasmids this time around.  Of course, if you're just playing Bioshock for the mechanics, you're missing something, and unfortunately it's the same thing that the devs missed this time around.  The meaningful character backstories and dank, oppressive feel of Rapture have both been dialed back a lot.  Sinclair is definitely no Atlas and Lamb is, well, pretty shoehorned in when it comes down to it.That being said, there's a lot of fun to be had here.  The weapons are fun and have much better variety than in the first, and the moral choices are a bit bigger this time around (as in bigger than ""would you murder a child for profit""- though that one's still here).

,Recommended,409720,31591216,Posted: 6 May,all,Cliche,"With some improvements over the first, and a few steps back, this game is worth a playthrough if you enjoyed Bioshock 1. This title took me 21 hours to beat while taking my time and completing all objectives AND the DLC on the hardest difficulty. The story feels weaker but some mechanics feel more polished and while I think a number of sequels can be played without first beating the original, this certainly isn't one.Unlike the first, this game has a standalone story DLC called Minerva's Den that, to me, outshines the base game in a few areas. The story is well written and well paced. By the end I felt like my time was well spent.Ultimately, if the story of Rapture interested you then you will find value here as this game takes place ten years after the first and shows you what happened in that time. However, if Bioshock 1 wasn't your cup of tea, you can safely shelf this one for another time."

First, this is not my first time playing Bioshock 2, this is my second.  I originally wanted to do the second game but the original was ported so badly that it crashed on me after the opening cutscene and I had to settle with getting a console version to play it for myself. It's a bit like the first game except shorter and instead being an enhanced human turned to a Big Daddy by the end, you are one from start to finish.  It has a few jumpy moments but not scary and I like that. Another thing I do like is that you get the chance to spare or kill certain choice characters to effect the ending.  Now since I played it the first time, I'm merely shadowing myself during the LP of it (at least 90%) and I'm nearing the end of the game as we speak so in about 4 more parts I should be done,  If it's worth the time and patience, try it for yourself, if you can look past the length, it really is a good game and worth the time of it that it's playable and fixed."

Game was fun (albeit really difficult for casual gamers that play more for story then difficulty. Easy mode can be considered ""normal mode"" for casual gamers).Anyways, I don't recommend remastered for two reasons:1) the textures they didn't remaster stick out like sore thumbs. There are some more detailed textures and effects. But, then you walk up to a texture on a bulkhead or a wall and it's just a blurred mess. Seems they remastered part of the game, but not all. So, the parts they didn't touch start to stick out and look ugly.2) The crashes... dear god ... the crashes. The game randomly commits suicide. The remaster comes out after a period of time when players are used to games auto-saving their progress now. Bioshock 2 only auto-saves your progress between major levels. Major levels take hours to plow through. So, you need to spam the quick-save key every 10 minutes or so or end up losing an hour+ of progress when a crash sneaks up on you like a ninja. There's no rhyme or reason to the crashes either. You get a crash in one area, then play through it again crash-free. These are the worst kinds of crashes, because they are so random. If you knew what caused them then you could perhaps do something about them. But, no... random. They haven't patched or updated the game to fix this stuff. So...yeah.I liked Bioshock 2 (original). It was an ok game. I would recommend it for players that like interesting story. But, the remaster doesn't add enough to warrant purchase, and the crashes it introduces create a net loss in value for the game. So, avoid the remaster. Get the original (if it's still sold). If not, then get the remaster and buckle in for some rage-inducing crashes."

When i first played bioshock i was a bit of a libertarian at the time and so i think i was defensive at the dystopian depiction of that ideology, but after how much i enjoyed the theme of bioshock 2 i may have to give it another go and see if my opinion of it has changed.I like the hacking game mechanic and i dont know if its supposed to be hard but i found myself able to get blue hacks nearly every time.Having not played the original bioshock 2 i cant make a direct comparison, but the graphics do still look dated in some ways but cranked up its enjoyable as is.Overall worth a buy on sale but probably not full price.Cheers, enjoy."

You just keep getting to play with your food, which was something first game promised but did not deliver on as well.Story wise, there are a lot of people talking at you the whole way through, but the environments and lay outs of props in the rooms tell more interesting tales than most of the dialog ever could. From what I can recall of the dialog it was flavoured rewordings of the following things.* Do this for me because the other person is a loon* How could you do this the other person is a loon* Sorry I'm a loon, but I'm sure you can find a way to kill me if I leave you cluesThe mid to late game is far better than the first game, but the story it tells is not as interesting. I do like the late game twists and shifts in perspective. They are quite novel and a pleasant distraction.Encounter lengths are generally pretty good, but the early game encounters are not balanced for what the player really has to hand.There are crashes. It feels like they are triggered by AI  because they usually happened when I spammed plasmids and every possible weapons on an enemy when researching. Maybe someone can crack open kismet and set a chaos monkey loose on the AI.  I found myself saving after every encounter as a result of the crashes."

And God do I regret the decision.I though Bioshock 1 Remastered was bad, it has a few glitches but was stable, but it also had a glitched at the end that is yet to be fixed for most people, but Bioshock 2 this game was a nightmare to run. It froze every hour or so, so most my time was spent worrying about saving the game, it used more FPS than the original despite looking worse, a simple comparison on youtube shows you that they messed up the shadowing and lighting, and reduced the details. I think the sound quality is also lower, I played the 2 and the original sounder louder and much more clear, but it might be me being paranoid.At the end of the day, this game is a timeless classic, it's original was great, and still is, the story is great, and Bioschok infinite just will blow you away if you played all 3, but this remake is not worth it, even on sale, get the old version. These remakes were really made for the next gen consoles, so they don't run well on PC, since it's more orientated for consoles. Just let the console peasants have their fun, while you enjoy smooth frame rates at high res, with mods on the older version.TL;DR: No complaints about the story and game play, It's full of glitches, it looks worse than the original and the original is worth more. DON'T BUY IT."

Saving your progress and loading times are quicker than the first (remastered) one. I only encountered two crashes which could be due to limitation of the engine at the time (unless remaster were done with updated engine). I had much more fun playing this than Bioshock Remastered because it didn't crash every hour or so.It also has updated visuals/resolutions and added FOV slider which should be mandatory to every FPS game.For me, this qualifies as a good remaster. And it's free, because it comes with the original Bioshock 2.Though I should mention that this is my personal opinion and this game could be unstable depending on your hardware."

When I got the remastered edition for free, I decided to play through the Bioshock series again and see how teh remasters changed anything. In light of having  recently finished the Bioshock 1 remaster with lots of pain with frequent crashing, I have to say that the Bioshock 2 remaster was much smoother...still with some crashes here and there, but not enough to make me frustrated to the point of the putting the game down for a several days.As for the game itself...I can see why people dislike the game, but don't necessarily agree. The story is different. The character is different. There's much less mystery as the story progresses than in the first game. But I don't think any of that makes it bad. I thoroughly enjoyed Bioshock 2 (Minerva's Den in particular) because it felt similar without being the same. Mechanics from the first game were more fleshed out with more plasmid upgrades, gene tonics, and some new weapons as well. Not to mention it's a blast running around as a Big Daddy drilling people to death.I felt that Bioshock 2 added a new dimension to the whole Rapture world because you got to explore the city from a different perspective, doubly so because you got to see it during its collapse (which probably came as a result of the actions of Bioshock 1). I really enjoyed learning more about the different kinds of Big Daddys, the motivations for each kind, the moral outrage against the Little Sisters, etc. Rapture is an intensely interesting setting for a game so I relished in the ability to learn more about it first hand."

This remastered edition is just what I needed. Not only did they make the game gorgeous, but it also ran seamlessly.As for Bioshock 2 as a game, it honestly wasn't what I expected. You play as a Big Daddy, which is a big change from the first game in the series. However, this proved to be insanely fun, especially with the improved plasmid system where you can shoot guns and use plasmids simultaneously without having to tediously switch between them. A weird thing about this game is that it is shorter and, in my opinion, much easier than the first game. I saved every Little Sister, harvested everything possible with each one, and accidentally lost an hour of gameplay due to a system crash (the only one that ever occured) and it still came an hour short of Bioshock 1.Regardless, it was a good game. I would definitely recommend playing the first game before this one. It just allows for further appreciation of Rapture and the storyline.I technically received the remastered edition for free, but I had bought the original."

The excitement of being a big daddy, not only for show, like the first title, but an actual living, breathing big daddy... was nothing like I expected.A game's job is to convey the intended experience to the player, and every aspect of it must reinforce the suspension of disbelief, and immerse the player into the game world. In The Witcher, you feel like a mighty, skilled demon slayer, that is however, still a human and a mortal; in Darkest Dungeon you feel helpless, and fearful, even when fully geared and learned, you fear every step could be your last. So it's only natural to expect that being a Big Daddy, a bio-engineered living weapon, created solely to protect little sisters against any and all threats, would feel big, and imposing, and mighty... nothing further from the truth.Once under the big daddy's helmet, you don't feel large, or powerful and, if anything, you feel weaker than a stranded survivor with a wrench. The iconic drill, so powerful it could pin a splicer against the wall, and shatter bulletproof glass, feels like a gimicky low power, fuel hungry tickle machine. The mighty rivet gun barely makes a dent on the splicers and machines, your melee hits annoy the splicers, instead of pushing them back against the wall, and overall, you feel like a random dumbass inside a diver's suit, not like a mighty engine of destruction, hellbent in settling matters.I failed the check for suspension of disbelief one too many times on this one, and lost interest to play a big daddy, if said big daddy can be taken down with 3 gunshots from a random splicer, as opposed to the powerful behemoths that took an RPG to the face, and rammed you against the wall in retaliation. Minor notes were the now dumbified hacking process, the lack of variety in... everything, but what lost me was the ridiculous nerfing of the Big Daddy."

I'm fairly confident they're doing something incorrectly as I've never had it crash once. The original version would crash after 15min or so of play, but this remastered version is steady and reliable. It's comical that the steam review system has become a place for people to vent technical issues instead of actually reviewing the content of a game. This isn't a tech support forum. Bioshock 2 is a fantastic game that I've played through half a dozen or so times. It's less impactful than the first, but the mechanics and gameplay make this an enjoyable experience throughout. If you keep in mind that the bulk of negative reviews are from people who misunderstand the purpose of a review system, you should feel confident that this game is well worth your time.Yes, it can be argued that the product should be evaluated in every area, including functionality, but perhaps a separate ""stability/performance"" review section should be implemented instead of mixing technical issues into the overall review of a game.TL:DR - This is a fantastic game that some people are having issues running."

Is this a joke?"" This game certainly needs that because you not only have a lot weapons and plasmids to cycle through, but also have different ammo types for each weapon. So especially in hard difficulty that makes you spend a lot of medkits before you find the weapon that you want to use. Yes there are hotkeys but it's not easy to quickly hit the right hotkeys in correct order in a conflict. That is a problem after the first game."

Rapture is a beautiful city full of colour and life.having said that, the gameplay is also excellent. unlike the first bioshock in which one can only use a weapon or a plasmid one at a time, the charactor you will controll is some kind of ogrelike giant human ( big daddy ) allowing the weilding of a rivit gun or chaingun in one hand and a plasmid in the other. also one can upgrade weapons, from a few precious selections but the option is still there. this game lacks any kind of stratagy or in-depth thinking but makes up for it in unexplainable joy as you smash in the head of an addict with the but of a giant rivit gun.i origianly played this game through when it first came out years ago and a few times in between then and now, i rarely ever play games through more than once, especially FPSs.so i would have to give this game a 9/10, and i dont do that lightly."

Even if you have played the Original Bioshock 2 I recommend playing this too as the updated textures and shadows are reasonably noticable. It certainly takes several playthroughs to really start to enjoy it. The gameplay is hectic, especially as in the heat of battle you are expected to select plasmids, select weapons, and switch ammo type. I actually prefer a playthrough with only a few plasmids (Electro Bolt, Incinerate, Hypnotise, and Telekinesis). I don't bother with any others.

My computer runs the game at 30fps on 1080p, however, nothing renders. Everything almost always looks like it needs a few seconds to render, but never does. Some surfaces or characters do render, but only momentarily as I am running around the map. I don't know if this is because of my computer or the game. When I lowered the resolution to 720p, the rendering issue was still a problem.

,Recommended,409720,30265635,Posted: 1 March,all,GuyInDogSuit,"Love, love, LOVE this game. I haven't played the original version, as I had to start over on the first one when the remastered versions were released, but the remaster was excellent. I owned the original versions so I got these for free. What's new in these versions is that textures have been upscaled, and reflections, shadows, lighting, colors, etc, have been improved. Sound has been improved as well. The game is also now playable in 4K resolution. I don't think saves are compatible with the original version, though, as that was also an issue with BioShock Remastered.The familar setting and FPS/action style hasn't changed much, but the protagonist is a newcomer, a Big Daddy, to be precise. You get the usual Big Daddy/Rosie weapons, including the drill, rivet gun, and so on, as well as a couple of old favorites. Believe it or not, but this particular Big Daddy can wield Plasmids, too. The Little Sisters also make a comeback, though this time they can collect ADAM for you. The story of this installment is much more involved and bittersweet, too. If you enjoyed the first game, be prepared for this one, as it has even more twists and turns, and may even leave you stunned or teary-eyed by the end.The DLC doesn't pull any punches, either. It is just as good; some may say even better than the base game. And again, an ending that will leave you speechless.On another note, some users reported various bugs and crashes with this remaster. Though in my personal experience, I didn't experience any more than I did with the original BioShock. A few crashes, but that's about it. There's ways to tweak the game if you have graphical issues (one has to do with mouse acceleration, which fixed texture issues for me).Should you get this game? Hell yes.Do you have to play the first game to enjoy this one? No, but it does make references to BioShock that will make you go, ""Ohhhh"" when you catch on. Kinda clears up a few murky plot points as well. So I recommend playing BioShock before playing this sequel."

Now this doesn't mean the remaster is perfect, there's still quite a few people who are experiencing problems. But I'm only reviewing my own personal experience so please keep that in mind.The game seems to run perfectly fine. Graphics are all by default set to the maximum values of the original with additional textures added into this remaster on characters and weapon models. I haven't seen anything that really stands out as being different otherwise like the remaster of the first game, but I'm sure there's quite a few additions.One issue that I've encountered that's rather minor is some low framerates when you first load a new level. It doesn't happen every time, but as the atlantic express is slowly approaching the next stop, i'll rotate the camera and notice the framerate is significantly lower than it should be. By the time I'm actually capable of walking around, the framerate is perfectly normal, but it is reason for concern.Aside from that, the game appears to functioning fine with no audio hitches, graphical artifacting, crashing, or bugs. And I have to say, it's a shame that Bioshock 2 is so often overlooked. It's a very interesting game with a lot of improvements over the first game. It has the same fantastic voice acting quality and story telling capabilities as the first. I particular like the audio recording stories of Mel, a father that discovers Rapture as he searches for what happened to his little girl and learns about rapture piece by piece with each audio recording. The fact that this story takes place several years after the events of the first game also makes for an interesting setting as rapture is more ocean than city at this point. Coral and barnacles line the hallways and the splicers look horrible deformed with disgusting growths on their limbs. It's a great presentation coupled with some much needed improvements to the game's combat that makes for a great experience.Again, it's a shame that not everyone is having as much luck as I am with this remastered version, but I can happily say that I personally am not having any issues and perhaps you won't either."

Despite the apparent utopia, class distinctions grew, and former gangster and businessman Frank Fontaine used his influence of the lower class to plan a coup of Rapture. Fontaine created black market routes with the surface world, and together with Dr. Brigid Tenenbaum, created a cheap plasmid industry by mass-producing ADAM through the implanting of the slugs in the stomachs of orphaned girls, nicknamed ""Little Sisters"".

If people are crashing that is a problem but most bad reviews seem to be because of the few graphics options...c'mon that's not enough to give it a bad review.  And multiplayer?  Are we really gonna need another multiplayer game, namely an old sequel?  Is it really that bad?  Is there a hole in your life now or can you find another game to play online?  I think you can if you try?Anyway, I'm having no issues.  I did up the FOV in .INI but 'gasp' that took all of 3 minutes including googling the fix.  As far as no graphics options, true it is bare but everything is on high, this is an old game that is getting like 100fps or more(didn't actually check) on my crappiest of used systems so...ya. It's maxed, but yes options are better.  The only thing I'm missing is a run key (you run in the intro cinematic?

,Not Recommended,409720,34493813,Posted: 25 August,all,DN Ministries,"BioShock 2 Remastered PC ReviewThe Moralist-Christian Perspective of the BioShock 2 Remastered NarrativeMost certainly, BioShock Remastered takes place before the era of postmodernism, which is “a skeptical worldview, founded as a reaction to modernism, that is suspicious of meta narratives and teaches that ultimate reality is inaccessible, knowledge is a social construct, and truth claims are political power plays.” However, as we will see, modernism is a time frame given to the 1700s through the 1900’s, “ in which assumptions about Christianity in the West- belief in the supernatural, a trust in biblical revelation, and the authority of the church- gave way to skepticism about religion, an embrace of scientific investigation and technological progress, a trust in human reason, and empiricism” – we can only know knowledge from what can be immediately perceived and derived from our common primordial senses of taste, touch, smell, feeling, and alterations in the genetic code of DNA, or otherwise, what is termed as the field of transgenics science, where inserting hormones and lethal injections into one’s endocrine, makes nature viable to physically sustain itself, more or less, without the addition of a supernatural being or creator. When we apply the era of modernism toBioShock 2’sworld, only then, can the Christian, theist, moralist and agnostic piece together the true wonders of the universe and of the ultimate reality of a dystopian underworld, hence, Rapture.Social Ethics ( Transcontinental thematic themes in Social Deism and the Socialist Agenda)The main character in the game, and whom we end up playing as is named Johnny Topside. He is only referred to as Big Daddy and through one of the antagonists, Grace Holloway, ‘ Tin Daddy.’  We see our main foils, Andrew Ryan, the mastermind behind Rapture’s founding and creation has a much different vision than that of Dr. Sofia Lamb. They do not only contrast themselves in matters of Rapture in the science fiction world ofBioShock 2, but also they differ across their worldview of philosophy, social politics, transcendental existentialism or known as transcendentalism in BioShock 2, which refers to empiricist claims on science and the transcending of individualism into the product and end goal of the final states of matter in people. Whereas, existentialism, and those who practice it, called existentialists, believe in those who can make their own choices out of free will and those who support a free trade market as well as principles that preserve the uniqueness of all individuals. Transcendentalism, on the other hand, is a very selfish religion, which is not a church body, although it has become one in BioShock 2.Andrew Ryan is loosely based on the legacy of Ayn Rand, who was an existentialist philosopher, but by the time her two most noteworthy works came out, existentialism was already a philosophy grounded on social progress and severe individualism, which gave rise to socialism later on in postmodernism and the rise of the bourgeoisie and proletariat classes. We only see this rise of socialism much later after the eventual collapse of Rapture at the end ofBioShock 2, which is why BioShock Infinite serves to complete the story of the expansion of our antagonist, Sofia Lamb and her taking out empathy, feeling(sympathy), and mercy with the chance of forgiveness of all people united under one common mind. Isn’t this the true meaning of utopia in its purest sense, in which Heaven and earth were created and formed by God? You can see the main problem with the game in the shape of a moral dilemma. It seems as if the Big Daddy first becomes the antagonist because we are ordered to kill off splicers, which so happen to be Dr. Lamb’s followers. This is overly graphic at times, and shows us that sometimes mercy, forgiveness, and justice is worth fighting for, but not if that resorts to murdering innocent people or even people who are drugged with ADAM in this case, which is a play on words to represent the second Adam in Christian history, which is Jesus Christ Himself.However, throughout the entire length of BioShock 2’s campaign, the only figures who are moralist and show a concern for the teleology of Rapture’s past history is Andrew Ryan and Johnny Topside, as well as Eleanor Lamb, the Little Sister we are paired with rescuing and then eventually living inside her through the ADAM that controlled our previous memories before she harvested us. The entire story is a play on Genesis, such as references to Eve’s Garden, ADAM to the first Adam, Adam and Eve, and the second Adam being Jesus Christ Himself. Still, BioShock 2 is crowded too much with dystopian violence for its other significant assets to be isolated and recognized. However, once they are isolated, then BioShock 2 becomes a purely philosophical and theologically grounded beauty of art. In the role of social ethics, the battle is between the deist and the moralist in Rapture, on the side of Andrew Ryan, comes the moralist and on Lamb’s side, the deist. Sophia Lamb created a newer breed of Little Sisters by kidnapping children underneath the surface, as she wants to manipulate and coerce them to her agenda. She gives no free will nor rational choice for one to follow her, whereas, Andrew Ryan does at all times in his side of taking the position of Richard Kearney’s new philosophy idea of Anatheos and Anathema, which is guided by the aesthetics of art, culture, and the preservation of a new resurgence of the Renaissance, to preserve morality and humanity to reach a perfected state in the rise of the new age of spirituality.In the end, Eleanor Lamb comes to finding herself and is able to escape Rapture through an idea of my own, which I call, the White Rose Arch-Dualist framework. In this theological framework, one is able to connect with a person on the other side of the same culture by relating with them through a real empathetic bond out of free will, salvation, and rational-choice. Eleanor Lamb exactly does this when she becomes internally bonded with her Big Daddy, who now acts as a Father to her to guide her, much like Jesus Christ is an example for all of his children spiritually. Remember, we are led to believe that Ryan is the enemy in this case, but the sheep in black clothing happens to actually be Sophia Lamb because she gives no offer of salvation nor free will but only constraints on the ultimate reality of circumventing everyone in Rapture to abide by absolutes- values and principles of morality that can only be pieced together for the sake of being viable to all people of the public interest without incorporation back into the metanarrative of the ultimate reality being the narrative.Overview of Succinct FeaturesStory- 2/10- Horrible attention to detail. A lack of emotional connection between the Big Daddy we play as and the Little Sisters. In addition, the first half of the storyline is directly misplaced before the second half, where the second half is filler background information which is unified with the philosophical and theological themes of the main story.Gameplay- 4/10- Bad. Along with a below mediocre rendition of explaining an otherworldly dystopian universe in which the transcendence of the self, rules above governmental authority, laws, and regulations in society, gameplay lacks the variety needed to maintain interest through the last 2/3rds stretch of the game’s entirety. The formula is non-systematic, although linear.Philosophical/ Thematic Theme Translation in Unity- 3/10- horrible.Presentation- 9/10- Nice graphics, overall, excellent atmosphere, with antiquated art with water effects that look photorealistic, water and fauna that looks life-like, and character models that make sense.Sound Design/ Choice – 8/10- ExcellentOverall score- 5/10- Fair"

So, I was very excited when I heard this game's remastered version announced. What I remembered is, when Bioshock 2 came out years ago, many reviews didnt like game's visual and they mainly critisized about game's engine which seemed a bit old when game came out at 2010.So, remastered version of the game is a really jackpot for me, cause several days ago, I downloaded old Bioshock 2 to play; then I waited remastered version's relase.And now, I finished this awesome game and I am very grateful and pleased. This game is a real master piece, with Bioshock of course.Generally speaking, Bioshock 2 is telling us a new story about Rapture City after Bioshock and this game is filling the blanks of first Bioshock very succesfully. But, actually, Bioshock 2 is giving us an opposite perspective view of a society order, than Bioshock. Instead of Andrew Ryan's self obsessed, individual focused freedom and community thoughts and ""individual should be existed for their own"", ""freedom of the individual to succed or fail on one's own merits idea"", we observe Sophia Lamb's altruist, selfless and collective ""family"" idea, ""individual belongs to others"".This two opposite ideas mixed with the flavor of art deco, sanity and awesome soundtrack; Bioshock series born. In these stories, we tested these ""idologies"" several times and observed their change, evolve and corruption. They tell you definetely some real and solid basic principles. I think, everybody should examine these ideas.About gameplay, there are several mistakes and fails. As visual experience, especially the remastered version could be better and we need definetely more graphic options but these fails won't bother you much while you are playing as a Big Daddy this game.There are lots of details to make you fullify yourself with the story, you should listen the all audio tapes. Examine and experience the world, the enviroment in this game. Observe the posters, readings, maps and splicier's behaviours and chats. You need to listen this awesome soundtrack. This game is not one of the a ""you are a gun; go kill it."" games, you need to live it.Trust me, and definetely give a shot to this serie. Play Bioshock first, and then play this game. You won't regret.""Love is just a chemical. We give it meaning by choice."""

This is why i cannot recommend them. There are numerous technical issues. Audio is a mixed bag. The game crashes really often. You can get stuck to scenery. The multiplayer has been completely removed. I’m sure no one was playing it but seeing that in the original it was sold as ”a rich prequel experience that expands the origins of the BioShock fiction.” removing it feels strange. Remaster of the original Bioshock added developer commentary but Bioshock 2 remaster does not. While the graphics have been updated with sharper textures the game looks nowhere near as good as it could have with proper care.---------Bioshock 2 puts the player in the boots of a Big Daddy. A huge scuba gear wearing genetically altered monster from the original game. The story begins when the little sister you are bonded with gets stolen from you and you are forced to commit a suicide. Ten years go by and suddenly you wake up. Your little sister is calling for help! It’s a really strong opening especially as it’s played in first person. The story is not as interesting as the original, but does have its moments. There are few amazing sections towards the end, but overall the ideas and twists are not that special. Compared to other FPS games the story still shines.The game begins very much like the previous Bioshock. You wake up in a strange place and something has gone very wrong. You start to get your bearings and listen to someone on the radio. You must gather equipment, fight monsters and search for loot. A bottle of wine gets you magic back and a chocolate bar gives energy and wait a minute… I’m wearing a full scuba gear. How can i eat anything? And also, if i was dead for a decade, how is my suit still working and my body did not rot away?This is the biggest falling of Bioshock 2. It feels like the developers tried to expand the lore or fix issues with the original but in doing so went too far with the logic of the gameworld and it starts to break down. In my eyes these issues are noticeable even to players who are not familiar with the original game. This does not break the gameplay but as the atmosphere and story are the things that raise the series above others more than the combat it does diminish that aspect.As a shooter Bioshock 2 is good. The gunplay is average, enemy AI is lacking and something about it feels stiff. Fortunately besides guns the player can use plasmids (”Magic” such as lightning and fire) and environment to help the battle. It is possible to hack a sentry turret, lure an enemy in it’s range and then freeze the baddie in place with a plasmid. This combination of different options keeps things interesting.The player is encouraged to use different ammo types or weapon+plasmid combinations and as a result the combat feels much more fluid than in the original Bioshock. Bioshock 2 doesn’t have survivor difficulty and on the hardest one available the game is quite easy. There is almost always plenty of ammo and money so it’s not that important to prepare for encounters.The areas are also quite large and have rooms that are optional to progress but usually contain audio logs that flesh out the story or items and skill upgrades to use. Bioshock is not an rpg or any of that sort, but the elements have more to them than standard shooter.Really striking thing about the series has always been the art style and Bioshock 2 is no exeption. The underwater art deco city is just amazing. It’s so original and so well executed that this alone is a good reason to play the game. That is why it’s so much more disappointing to see the remaster not do justice to it.I did like Bioshock 2. It’s not as memorable as the original and at times feels kind of pointless as a sequel but it is a well made shooter."

This depseprately needs sorting out as it breaks the immersion and fun of the game.So in summary it's good fun, but it's the weakest entry in the Bioshock series."

The game only saves around 7 times the whole game (i counted it because i  saw how bad it is so i wanted to put it in the review).  The story is really good and the gameplay is superb, It takes the gameplay from the first game and makes it even better by allowing you to dual wield a weapon and plasmid. It also gives you the iconic drill and makes you play as a big dady. Its one of my best games of all time.So overall this game is great but from what i heard its unplayable from the many bugs. Hope they fix it so people can enjoy this game.10/10 (withought bugs)"

Even with the settings turned down to attempt to compensate for the crashes (doesn't work btw.)The gameplay mechanics are noticibly improved over the original Bioshock as well.If the devs could solve the crashing issue it would be a must have.The ONLY reason I am downvoting this version is because it is not a stable build."

Compared to Bioshock , or Bioshock Infinate, it is.  But then again, most games pale in comparison to Bioshock.  The combat is ok, the story is transparent and mostly unintersting, and furthermore it is a rather unstable port.  Do I regret playing it? The second time, yes I do.  The first time, no.To surmise, if its on sale, and you want a decent shooter with some neet weapons (I do have to say some of the weapons are cool) you should buy it.

,Recommended,409720,32638456,Posted: 22 June,all,MostUnorthodox,"**I recieved this version of Bioshock 2 for free due to having the original game in my library already. This is not a review of the remaster as I haven't played the original in a very long time and as such haven't got anything to compare it to.**Bioshock 2 is the sequel to the cult classic Bioshock, an incredibly atmospheric horror-shooty affair. In many ways, Bioshock 2 improves on the original, in many ways it doesn't.THE GOOD:Combat was always very satisfying in Bioshock. This game is no exception. New weapons improve upon the original game and the ability to have both a plasmid and weapon selected at the same time is a definite improvement; as a result combat is much more fast-paced and exciting.ADAM is much more scarce in this game, though by the end I still had around 300 spare. This is a drastic improvement to how common it was in the original game, which left you with near-no challenge.THE MIDDLE:Hacking is MUCH easier in this game than it was in the original, provided you have good reaction time. I personally don't like this, as hacking was already fairly straightforward, but you may feel different. Hitting a blue segment while hacking will give you a bonus with whatever you're hacking, so that's also nice.THE BAD:For somebody in a metal diving suit you seem to be made of wet cardboard. Enemies do massive amounts of damage. There are plot reasons for this however plot should add on to gameplay, not sacrifice it. In addition to taking much more damage, the number of health kits and EVE you can carry has been reduced from 9 to 5. You can purchase more slots for them at a Gatherers Garden, however this seems like a needless way to make the game more irritating.I use the word irritating because it isn't more difficult. Difficulty remains at the same level, but I found myself dying much more in Bioshock 2 than in the original game. I often defaulted to revival-scumming in order to take out tougher enemies as there's no penalty for using Vita Chambers, save only being revived with half health.(Do note that you can turn off the ability to use vita chambers, though I usually play with them on because I'm a filthy casul)In addition, and what I believe the most damning thing is: THIS GAME IS SHORT. SERIOUSLY.It took me less than 8 hours to finish this game. That includes most of the optional stuff. The original game took bare minimum twice as long to complete. From a sheer price-to-time POV, this game isn't worth more than $10.I still enjoyed this game, but pick it up on a sale. It isn't worth full price."

Will trying to finish the game A.S.A.P and move on into the last series that is Bioshock Infinite. My advice now is avoid this game at all cost, specialy if you planning to buy it instead of getting it free like me. Just waste of time and waste of efforts from lazy developer.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------After finished my 17 hours journey on Bioshock 1 Remastered now I'm currently 3 hours on Bioshock 2 Remastered gameplay. The story and ambiance of Rapture always amaze me and draw me to exploring it. Though this PC Remasterd edition in my opinion kind of ""fail"" of bringing the true meaning of word ""remastered"" by only giving us PC user a port of console version with limited graphic settings, still nothing can beat that old feeling of nostalgia when I finished the original first and second game back at end of 2013. This remastered edition succeed to satisfy my urge to exploring Rapture for the second time with new boost on graphics technology.Now lets talk about technical matters, I'm running Bioshock Remastered Edition on my AMD FX-8350+GTX 980 with latest driver, direct x and windows update. Playing almost 3 hours currently of Bioshock 2 Remastered I'm feeling blessed that I'm are one of those people that encounter none of major problems like crash, lost of save data, button not mapping, etc. I set my vsync off, and the game are doing great with 120fps average and drop only as low as 80fps. I put audio setting on 7.1 since I playing it using my Logitech G430 7.1 headset, and also never encounter any audio bugs like some people said on community discussion. I hope all stays fine until I finished the game but if I encounter any bugs or crashes surely I will edite my review and write it down here.Final thought, Bioshock Remastered Collection for me are big yes in term of taking me back on nostalgic journey of exploring Rapture for second time. The big no are shame 2K give us PC players a port version of it with only little difference with console version and limited graphic tweak/settings. If only 2K want to spare their time and effort to create a different version of true remastered meaning for PC version then I 1000% believe this series will reborn again on much greater impact and boom for PC gaming community.I also hope that 2K comes up with the patch as soon as possible for people out there that having problems with their game. Though I get this game for free, I know that there are hundreds of people out there that buying this remastered edition on full price and just begin their journey on Bioshock series, and 2K that mean dont you disappoint this kind of people that you let down not only by the minor upgrade or mislead meaning of ""remastered"" but also by giving them unpleasant playing experience with lots of crashes or bugs. You already kind a fail of bringing the term of ""remastered"" so dont give this people and extra let down with your unstable gameplay that occurs to some of people out there.FInal score:- 10/10 of bringing me back into a fantastic journey in Rapture- 6.5/10 in term of failed ""remastered"" true meaning and crash or unstable gameplay that happend to people out there"

,Recommended,409720,32419743,Posted: 14 June,all,Cam,"Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐Decent remaster/up-res of a good game, the combat was much improved over the original and the game never outstayed it's welcome, ending at just about the right time. I love howe the ending respected my choices throughout the game, and the DLC was a fantastic little short story. I only have two complaints:1) Random crashes - I had 4 crashes throughout my playthroughs of both the main story and DLC, which wasn't the end of the world but was certainly frustrating given how the game only autosaves when you start a level. After being set back twice I learned to save more frequently.2) Difficulty - While the game didn't feel too hard or unfair and did feel balanced as long as you were always picking things up and buying stuff, it certainly felt like some of the enemies were just too agile to ever avoid their damage and there usually felt like a few too many with too big of health bars. I feel like these numbers could have been tweaked just a little to make the game feel more fair.Otherwise an all around great game, both seperate from the series and as a part of the trlogy."

I wrote a little crash fix post here (https://steamcommunity.com/app/8850/discussions/0/1471969431593266968/) that also has a link to another guide if my fix didn't work for you.This really is an amazing game. My support for the BioShock franchise is... Infinite.... get it....? Oh never mind! If you can handle a little front end work to get the game working it is WELL worth the $19.99. It has nearly all the elements of game play that made BioShock 1 a windfall, and it is much longer. And while it doesn't have a comparable epic plot twist like it's predecessor, the narrative is engaging, and has many clever tie ins from BioShock 1.I saw someone complaining that the environment was all re-textures. Well... so what? We're still in Rapture. Was it supposed look completely different? Personally I enjoy their rendition of Rapture. Considering that a different division of 2K Gaming (2K Marin) created this game (The original creators returned for BioShock: Infinite), the way they stayed true to the spirit of Rapture was very admirable indeed.Well, you've been warned, there are some crash bugs, but still worth the time, effort, and money IMHO.Cheers,Samwhell"

The remaster is terrible due to technical failings.A beautiful, crashtastic mess. Even with the recommended fixes, the aptly named 'RemasTURD' is still an unstable pile of you-know-what. Which is frustrating, because when it's actually running, the graphics are lovely and the game play is engaging. The crashes were completely unpredictable. Sometimes, it would be hours between crashes. Sometimes, the game would crash three or four times in a row.  It would hapen in combat, out of combat, immediately following loads, during saves, in the middle of an empty hall. In areas that were graphically intense or places that had few textures or animation. Places with no enemies at all, places with only one enemy that had yet to activate/become hostile. The best way to circumvent loss of progress was to save frequently, but having to save every few minutes does more than ruin immersion. It turns into a chore what should be a good, clean fun.""Bioshock 2"" is a great game, but suffers from both kinds of 'sequel syndrome.' Firstly, it's predecessor was so innovative and successful that one can't help but have expectations for this installment, which inevitably leads to disappointment. Secondly, it can't quite step out of the previous game's shadow in the story department, at least as far as plot is concerned. Simple plot summary: the player assumes the role of someone who arrives unexpectedly (and mysteriously), with unknown motivations. The player receives immediate assistance via radio from a person of influence. This ally convinces the player they are both on the same side and should unite against a common enemy... who happens to be the person running the city. Sound familiar?This installment seems to place greater focus on new game play elements and encounters (Big Sisters, a greater selection of Gene Tonics and more available slots, a different mini-game for hacking, etc). Options on how to manage Little Sisters are more interesting (harvest? gather? rescue?) and the new plasmids make for intriguing changes in play (Scout is a lot of fun, especially for those who enjoy stealth/infiltration games). The new weapons are enjoyable, as well (even if some were functionally indentical to their counterparts in the first game, they still have a unique look and feel).Atmospherically, the music is... off. It's hard to describe, but in comparison to the first game, the placement, prominence and selection of music in ""Bioshock 2"" just doesn't feel up to snuff. In ""Bioshock,"" the music was superb. The right track playing at just the right time to maximize mood and effect not only enhanced the game, but enriched it. ""Bioshock 2"" has another great soundtrack, but it's not implemented anywhere near as well. Memorable tracks that are representative of the era in which the game is set and are thematically appropriate seem to be arranged in an almost forgettable manner and are often subverted by ambient sound effects (even after adjusting music and SFX volumes in the audio options menu). Sad.8/10 for the story, new design elements and continued development of the game world. The original version of ""Bioshock 2"", if stable, is recommended unconditionally. As is, the ""RemasTURD"" is an experience to be endured rather than enjoyed.edit: disclaimer at top and overall clarity."
