There are better ones you can get for much cheaper; ones where the people involved with the game care about giving their audience the best experience possible.Save your money; they don't deserve it for this disappointing effort."

I'm requesting a refund now because this is beyond what the screenshots led me to believe. A bit of censorship is one thing, but this is way way beyond what the pink mist screenshots show.Literally can barely see the character. I went through the first time of motivating the girls and all that was visable was about a third of one of the girls calves, another showed a little bit of her hair, and I think at one point I could almost make out the eyes. Completely and utterly ridiculous.Oh, and not really anything in the way of a voice file either. A smacking sound (the whip) and a hint of the shuffling of a body."

,Not Recommended,409850,29271778,Posted: 15 January,all,CJ,"I'm afraid I can't recommend this game. I wanted to like it, I really did, but the gameplay is just plain unenjoyable. The only things I can enjoy a little tiny bit are the conversations, but even those are as anime cliche as it gets.7 hours in and the story is still flatter than Etna and Flonne. The infamous motivation minigame is neither fun nor interesting to look at, even with the uncensorship mod. There are multiple kinds of motivations where each is its own kind of minigame, one more tedious than the other. None of them has any appeal at all. The girl is in the background, the more you motive her the less clothes she has. But still, not even a nip. Teasers, nothing more. They do wear different clothings based on the kind of motivation, but even then they're still in the same pose, so pretty uninteresting.The rest of the game is dull. You walk around with blurry pixelated characters, the areas you walk around in are uncreative as all hell. There are small plains which are connected by paths, and sometimes there's a door, that's it. I've seen three environments in those 7 hours, and they're all following this idea. They do change the theme, but even those aren't interesting to look at.When walking you encounter random battles. Battles give exp and ""CM"" which is the currency in this game. With this currency you buy items, and... ""motivate"" the girls. The problem is that you barely get any CM, so motivation happens very rarely. But you need to motivate them in order for them to learn new skills, and those are mandatory. The enemy HP ramps up very quickly, and you constantly feel outleveled and just try to keep the girls alive somehow, even with skills. And guess what, that's also not fun. This actually frustrated me so much that I spent an hour or two cheating the girls up, giving them max stats. Combined with a cheat to prevent random encounters I can focus on running through those boring levels, trying to get through the story at least once. I really wouldn't bother playing this game without cheating, and it hurts me to say that. I really liked the basic premise but it's just too amateur.The game is just a giant fan service, it's all about the girls. You got your innocent one with big eyes and huge♥♥♥♥♥♥ you got your loli twins, you got shy psychic loli, you got big♥♥♥♥♥♥""I hate men"" girl, and so on. Some of which you have no idea why they'd even be in this place, since this is a place for people who would've become criminals in the future. You can't tell me huge♥♥♥♥♥♥samurai-girl would ever become a criminal.After motivating the girls they tend to come to you with some wish. From what I've seen you can fulfill four wishes for each girl, but having them come up with that takes a long time. My only hopes are that after all wishes are fulfilled there's some special ""treat"".The only thing that differentiates this game from casual RPG maker games is the voice acting."

I give the game 7/10, would have been higher without the censorship. If you are reading this, please sign the petition to stop censoring games on steam:https://www.change.org/p/nis-america-release-criminal-girls-2-party-favors-uncensored-on-steamThese games rarely go on sale, so I decided to grab the title for $15. My hope is that with steam sales being higher, and people signing this petition, NISA may make extra efforts when bringing titles to steam. Steam doesn't block the censorship, its that they port it to the console first. PlayStation doesn't allow Adult Only ratings from the ESRB. So NISA makes the game able to be played on the PlayStation and then we get that port. Not the best scenario, but that's what we are dealing with. So sign the petition!Censorship:Brief points on what they censored if you don't watch the below YouTube video:- Mini game has pink smoke around it (thing about this is, the mini game is what separates this from the other 300 million dungeon crawlers- Art work was redone by the original artist to add more panties and to remove nipples that can be seen through the clothing (indentations)YouTube link comparing the censorship (not my video):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jZkevQNj3MOfficial Modding Thread:http://steamcommunity.com/app/409850/discussions/0/142261352642554243/- Confirmed Pink Smoke has been removed from mini game"

I do not know if the game has some massive spike in quality once you get out of the tutorial, but I'm willing to bet money it doesn't.**Nippon Ichi is known for making grindy games fun.  This is an exception to that rule.  In the early game, you need to grind the resource to quite literally BDSM the girls into submission to make them gain skills.  Skills like ""Have the ability to attack"".  You start off with one character who can fight, period, and god help you if you chose meek little glasses girl, who requires more grinding to deal more than one to five damage a round.What really sucks is that even once you do grind up all four of your usable characters to be able to attack, no more than two can in any given round.  And you don't get to pick which two.  So randomly all three of your useful attackers could decide they want to partner up with little miss 1-5 damage a round and the turn is a wash.  You can't even pick if they're going to use their skills or do a regular attack, it comes down to ""did you roll a useful turn on the game's random number generator?""There are some people who bought this game because anime boobs.

Good character designs 33/100 level design because really only 1/3 of the level design intrigued me and that was because of the story. Story itself has two real kickers.The Miningame: to be quite honest, I didn't really care that much playing it, but the censorship itself is annoying because I personally hate any form of censorship whether it'd be good natured or not, so I use the uncensored mod, and I would really like the full non live-2d as still images, but the minigames themselves are nothing, but the rewards are amazing in the sense that you get sick as ♥♥♥♥ abilities to use in combat.The Combat: 4 vs X rpg style, enemies can be from 1 enemy to 6 and all do something. so I just end up spamming the ""use"" key/button.

,Recommended,409850,34230645,Posted: 14 August,all,madd.dawgg,"Played through the game on PS Vita so I will assume story etc is the same. If you have not played it before, you lead a group of misfits through several layers of a dungeon. You 'motivate' your team of girls differently on each level. The first method is spanking, for example. It's very cartoony and fun and tongue-in-cheek. I really like the unique game play as well. The game is simple dungeon crawling with random battles a la Final Fantasy. But, instead of choosing your commands from a command list, instead each girl is given a random command, and you choose one of those commands. You can always choose to use an item though, and you will (likely) have to use items to beat the game. The game is never overly difficult. You'll likely want to grind exp for motivating the girls, anyways. Decisions on who to motivate are meaningful. But overall, it's pretty simple and straightforward. Linear story that is mostly just fun. You will like the characters and they are all a bit different. If you like this type of raunchy game, this is one of the best. The PC version is significantly better than the Vita version in terms of graphics and the mods of course improve it. Highly recommend."

However, when I go to ""motivate"" the girls, my motivation tool (whip or similar item) will stop working until a temptation or few has passed. It occurs frequently enough to be considered a bug, yet I find the timing so frustrating and deliberate (usually near to upgrading the girl's attack powers) that I can only consider it deliberately written into the game. And this makes me sad."
76561198037514898,Recommended,409850,31147285,Posted: 14 April,all,Puddles,"It's too bad that the motivational mini-game is what gets all the attention with this game.  Will some people be offended by it?  Probably, but its really not that bad.  Honestly, I find the censorship of the game significantly more offensive than the content.  Not because of any censorship principals or anything, but because it was done so badly.  Part of the game is motivating the girls to follow your orders and through the mini-game you motivate them to gain new powers.  As the levels progress with each type of motivation the girls clothing becomes more disheveled (more revealing, but no nudity).  Here is the thing, NISA decided to cover the mini-game with pink fog to obscure the girls... to the point that in the early stages you can barely see them.  The problem is that if anyone were to get offended by these images it would be in the later levels (where its more revealing) and that's where the pink fog is lessened.  So the censorship doesn't obscure anything offensive, it just makes a mess of the early stages of the mini-game.So, they really screwed up the marketing by ""censoring"" the game by adding pink fog, removing the girl's voices during the mini-game and by removing about 25% of the artwork available at the end of the game.  The good news is that if you look at the forums here for the game, you will find that there is a patch that can be applied that will remove the pink fog and restore the voices.The sad thing is the whole mini-game controversy really detracts from the game itself which is actually pretty good.  The story is pretty good and much sweeter and good natured than you'd think with all the talk of spanking the girls to motivate them.  The characters are all unique, well done and develop throughout the game.The battle system in this game is very unique.  Each of the girls will eventually develop between 10-15 different attacks, but you never get to decide on which attack they'll use on a given turn.  Instead each of the 4 active girls will tell you what their strategy will be for that turn (including potentially teaming-up) and you decide which of their strategies you want to use.  You can also switch one girl out of the active formation every turn in hopes of getting a new or better strategy.  The system probably isn't for everyone, but I thought it was an interesting change that fit the story, and certainly added a bit of challenge.In short, if you are _easily offended_ maybe stay away.  Otherwise if you are looking for a good JRPG, get this game and be sure to download the 3rd party patch.  Not so that that you'll see anything erotic or titillating, but just so you can avoid the butcher job NISA did trying to censor the game."

A really good demonstration of how hell really feels!What could possibly be better than a combat system, where the character AI themselves decide what they can do, and you just have to click on ONE button! Of course in this game it works just wonderfull, with characters who advice you to use an ultimate every second round against normal mobs, but in boss fights they feel more like going double team close combat with the groups mage against the boss.While the character sprites exist in fairly high resolution, more than enough for FullHD, none of the developers had the idea that watching upscaled 900x544 backgrounds all day could be quite irritating with time. Kuddos to them for putting black bars of a few pixels of width to both sides, because reworking the artwork to actually fit 16:9 is way too much work for a 20€ game.And now to the point probably most people are here for in the first place: The Motivation Scenes!If you enjoy minigames with little girls in rather less clothing as background, uhm yeah i guess this game would be something for you, but dont expect anything else.Oh yeah right, and the story! The game actually has a story! You sometimes nearly forget that after grinding for 2 hours without character interaction. I would say the story writing is on the level of an Anno 1701 endless game. It does not really exist, getting trough it takes endless and noone really cares cause they are busy with other stuff, like in this game: grinding or watching grade schoolers getting electrocuted.Core Features:-Glorification of Pedophilia-In depth combat system-Optimized for 16:9,07 displaysAs i said in the begining, the pain and agony you feel when playing this game are probably a representation of how pedophiles suffer in hell.

So, I just started the game and had that Idea in mind and the first thing I get to see is my character, as in me, being slapped for not waking up. Then being slapped again for not knowing what to do. The instructor is quite... strict. But yea, that is where I am now and suddenly I am being tasked with bringing these four girls up the tower, while finding the other three that escaped. And take a wild guess. They dont want to take orders from me. A few slaps towards my character, a bit back and forth and finally they follow me.But it doesnt just run smoothly for long. Because suddenly we are being attacked by a ""convict"" which is basically a demonic entity in this realm. None of the girls want to fight and the instructor tells me to ""motivate"" a girl by... I cant believe that I am writing this... Spanking her. Its save to say that I dont think that the word is used quite right so I bet it got lost in translation or just was censored. Which brings me to another point. Now that the battle had begun and is over right quick, I am tasked with going upstairs. Getting there, I have to fight more convicts and finally reach the ""infirmary"" which is basically a basecamp where you can buy stuff and rest and save... AND MOTIVATE your girls. And since I couldnt get any further without motivating at least 2 of them, I had to do just that.Now here is where the censorship shows. I have, out of pure curiosity, installed the patch that lets me enable and disable the censors. And I was simply curious at what they tried to censor away. It turns out that, what they censor, is basically just them playing a dressup game while being spanked/whipped. Yeeeeeea... Oh well, having done that I quickly dispatch of the stronger convict and head up. I fight my way through more convicts and two stronger variants and find some loot that not only opens a door but also gives me access to a ""Emergency Rope"" kind of item. And that is where I stopped for now. I will be playing this longer even though I have mixed thoughts on that... ""minigame"". Depends on what comes later on the game I guess but as of right now, dont know why they censored it. But with time probably comes change so we shall see when I update this review to a full on review. I just wanted to check it out and give you my first impressions."

Mainly some lewd visuals and lines(not so sure about this one?) have been taken out of this game, and it has♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥a lot of people off.But does that simply make this game unplayable? Not at all.This is a pretty good game. Even though you probably won't be able to jerk off to the girls during motivation time, the gameplay and the story more than make up for it.The combat system is very refreshing. You will be tasked to choose which girl's battle plan makes the most sense. You can also trigger cool combo attacks. It's pretty easy to understand. Something I like.The story is actually very heartwarming. You will be with these delinquents from when they all did not like one another, to the point when they become inseparable friends. The multiple endings are great too.The 4th trial was my favorite.It isn't very expensive either. I bought this at 20 bucks, and it was definitely worth the money. I would recommend it to any JRPG fans.I've seen negative reviews where guys with 2 hours of gameplay or less simply refused to continue because some non-story related things were cut. Those guys are missing out on a pretty good game. Shame.P.S. To those still angry at the censorship, there are mods in the community forums you know. Some amazing people are working their asses off to bring back the contents that were cut.EDIT: It is laughable how a lot of people♥♥♥♥♥♥on this game because of the censoring, neglecting all of the other things that this game has. I'm sorry that you couldn't wank to this game. These people are pathetic."

,Recommended,409850,29690948,Posted: 4 February,all,Hirdy,"At first combat will feel boring and the characters aren't very interactive with eachother. But As the game progresses you'll find yourself learning more about eath girl and you can find combo skills in the world that progress chacters intereaction in combat and the more you play, the more you feel the girls have connections with each other.The ""Girl's wish"" system is really well placed and gives more meaning to each girl and to exploring.the worlds aren't complex but they do get better as the game progresses.The games scaling is fair and doesn't need too much in the way of grinding but don't expect to be able to fly through on your first play through.The game also has a much higher difficulty than I first assumed.If you're a big Otaku, you're okay with lewd scenes and you have a love for classic turn-based RPGs. Then I highly recommend this game to you."

As the protagonist (read as sadist) you spank, whip, lotion, electrocute, and otherwise physically torture the girls in this game to fight for you so you can escape hell. Hell being a dungeon grind experience that only let's you unlock the features of the game after you beat each boss. Each of the girls is a stereotypical anime cardboard cutout character without any actual personality. I tried to make my way through this game in search of an intriguing plot, but there just isn't any. ""Fetish Dungeon Crawler Torture Soft Porn"" the video game gets a 1/10 from me."

76561197996085041,Recommended,409850,29516042,Posted: 26 January,all,Edward Elric,"Censorship doesn't bother me, mod in forum that is sticky fixes anything major you might have an issue with. The overall gameplay is fun to me, the RNG moments with the combat aren't that bad when you get the girls skilled properly, the beginning is the hardest, and it is a different type of combat. The RNG works in your favor I feel. I always have an AoE attack skill pop when 3+ mobs appear, guard when a big attack is coming, and heal/taunt when needed.The game is grindy, Persona 1-3 grindy or like Devil Survivor, not old-school Runescape/WoW grindy though that♥♥♥♥♥♥was hell, but it does have a small grind. You can't just speed run it and blast the bosses down, Persona 4. Overall it is what I wanted, another Sim/JRPG to hold me over until Disgaea 2 (Pre-ordered Dood!) and Persona 5 comes out. Overall score? 7.5/10 I think is fair for now, unless something later in the game triggers me, ohhhhhhhhhhhhh boi.Edit: More about combat and game difficulty.I firmly feel the beginning of this game is the worse part for most. When you have 7 girls (which happens quick) that have at least half of their skills available (also easy to do as you progress) you can constantly pour out damage/heals/support (also changing girls in battle re-rolls the skill/attack menu, this helps a lot with their battle system).Then the field skills can let you abuse certain aspects of the game. E.g. Alert/Rest then explore to just hunt for items and get to bosses, or Shouting right next to the infirmary. These 2 aspects can allow you to rush areas and grind whenever you want, and can maximize grinding since I usually run past a floor or 2 just getting goodies then farm at the 2nd infirmary. Also field skill Return so no more need for them rest tickets if you watch your mana. Do not be scared to use items either you can change a girl, use item, and try to escape every turn before you use a move. I honestly can’t say I’ve “grinded” yet in this game, I have been using Alert a lot to avoid useless battles, because item hunting alone can rack the CM.I came here to write this because I finally lost to a boss and that was because I was unprepared for his 50% tactic and missed clicked a couple turns, and it made me reflect on the combat and overall game difficulty so far. Overall I’m enjoying the combat, it is something different, and I have never been bothered by changes in a game (except for the first time WoW changed their talent system, which triggered me, still does I think even though I stopped playing), keeps it interesting."

76561198339903134,Recommended,409850,29312208,Posted: 17 January,all,Blitz Gazer,"I recommend this game to players who likes to grind because each area (I'm not talking about floors, I'm talking about the grass, fire, ice, etc. area because each area can have 3 or more floors) requires a few or a lot of grinding for CM (to buy items or skills) or levels depending in your playstyle (easy a lot of grinding, normal a few grinds and hard rushing without grinding). The only pixelated part of this game is when your exploring the dungeon but the artwork in battles, dialog portraits and infirmary are not that pixelated at least IMO. As for the censoring, just go to the discussions page and read the pinned topic about it.This is what I did to make this game easy:Get Ran's Guard skill first after you get everyones attack before the 1st boss fight very usefull and at the next area get Sako's shout field skill and use it near the infirmary to start grinding without the worry of using items since the infirmary will restore your HP/MP for free and after that your on your own.By the way I already have this game on my PS Vita but I like it so much that I bought it again this time for pc in steam. I'm currently waiting for Criminal Girls 2 to be translated for PS Vita R3 and I'm hoping for a steam release of Criminal Girls 2+Digital Art work and OST bundle as well."

Although there are a few things I find tedious mostly the motivation sequences because it's necessary for leveling up, and there is a fair amount of grinding. but the story of a combat system is unique enough to keep me interested. people's main complaint seems to be censorship I don't really mind it that much but they're already that take out most of the censorship and probably soon all. So I mean if that's your main concern the just download the mod for it, it's not that hard.  It's an enjoyable RPG what's a fun cast of characters and a interasting combat system and nice story. It's not for everyone but if you like JRPGs and are looking for something different this might be what you're looking for, or if you're just a pervert then I guess you will need it install the mods then I think you will enjoy it."

I haven't played too much but thanks to this games rather odd appeal (I like odd games, okay?) and the help of the mod that removes the smoke I can say this game has hooked onto my attention rather fierce. A worthy buy and worthy of the time spent so far and entertaining in the sense you do what you the player wants to do. The start however does a poor example of showing you just how much choice you have in this but after sometime you can influence the girls to be more powerful through the motivate system. So if you're like me and wanna make sure the games worth the buy and can run on you're PC and all that jazz, the games good to go. Just install the remove pink smoke mod and play to your hearts desire."

The character portraits are good in design, and the CG sections have good quality to them too.Overall, it's a fun time-killer.

The grinding can be a bit tedious towards the end of the game (if you are attempting to get the true ending or 100% completion). I don't mind grinding too much, but I had to split it into sessions to get everything done. The story is decent. I like the world they've built, but things may ramp up a bit quickly when the girls start falling for you all of a sudden (not that it's that bad, but I didn't feel like I earned it XD). The soundtrack is great, so I'm glad to have gotten the bundle on sale. Hopefully we can see a release of the sequel on Steam, but I'll play it on the VITA in the meantime.P.S. Do not play unless you have the community patches.They've done a great job of bringing the true experience of Criminal Girls to the west. The heavy censorship can really be a turn off for most, myself included, so do yourself a favor and play the game the way it was meant to be played."
