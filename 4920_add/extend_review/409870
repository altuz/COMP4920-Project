,Recommended,409870,24522270,"Posted: 25 July, 2016",all,Durante,"Phantom Brave is Nippon Ichi's most unique and innovative SRPG, and my personal favourite of theirs. It's also pobably their most serious in terms of story, even though there are still many comedic moments in that more dramatic overall framework.However, what makes the game unique are really its gameplay systems, and most directly 3 of its features:Free movement and positioning on the map - unlike in most SRPGs, particularly those developed in Japan, you arenot bound to a grid, or hexes, or any other fixed partitioning. This also means that all spells and attacks have ranges which are expressed in 3D shapes, not sets of tiles.All your units except Marona are Phantoms which are""confined""into objects on the battlefield. Depending on which objects you use this causes significant effects on stats. Furthermore, phantoms only remain on the battlefield for a limited number of turns (depending on some factors).Both battlefield objects and units can be equipped as items, and often grant item-specific skills.There's more to it of course, including the N1 staple character and item leveling, as well as a random dungeon generation system, and so on and so forth. But the 3 points above are what make it very unique even in the space of N1 SRPGs.The PC version of the game is marketed as DEFINITIVE, and as far as I can tell that is absolutely the case. It includes all the content from all previous releases (including dual audio tracks), supportsarbitrary resolutions and 60 FPS, and includes recreated HD UI graphics as well high-res 2D art. Both mouse/keyboard and gamepad controls are supported and work well. Outside of recreating all the sprites - which is understandably out of scope for a port such as this - it's about as great a version of Phantom Brave as we are ever likely to get.In addition to the unique gamplay, the game also features a fantastic soundtrack, probably one of the best in any N1 game.Overall, it's a must play for all SRPG fans, especially those who have not played any of the game's previous versions.(Oh, and I did play its previous versions, so this review is based on the entirety of the game, regardless of what the hour count says)"
,Recommended,409870,24617695,"Posted: 30 July, 2016",all,Haze,"Phantom Brave was ahead of its time.In the PS2 era, it seemed like every RPG (or maybe all genres, actually) needed to go BIGGER. More dramatic, more epic, more serious. Nippon Ichi carved a niche for itself with Disgaea, a silly RPG that tried to be as un-serious as possible. It was more of an episodic anime, full of comedy and parodies. It was in the right place at the right time, and got a lot of attention.However, Phantom Brave took a riskier path. It was a ""serious"" story, yet instead of a fantasy epic, it aimed to be a gentle slice-of-life. You're not the center of the universe, but just a person in a tropical archipelago filled with strange and diverse characters. The story is about the orphan girl Marona, innocent and naive, watched over by her jaded phantom bodyguard, Ash. She tries to make her own way through the world, but her optimism clashes when it comes up against reality's cynicism and prejudices. This kind of character-driven story was very rare in games at the time, but is something that's become much more accepted in the past few years.The gameplay system is also far ahead its time, though it may be still too advanced for us in 2016. There's a lot more freedom in this compared to the usual tactical RPG map battle. For one thing, you can free-roam instead of moving within a square grid. I like it better this way, but I have to admit it's a little clunkier just trying to move where you want. And there's more.... Confining phantoms to objects such as trees and rocks, which give different stat bonuses, yet they only last a limited number of turns in battle, so you have to pace yourself depending on the map. There's so much to keep track of. Yet there's no short-term pleasures like the team-attacks in Disgaea, it's all about the long-term strategy in each battle.Same for outside of battle, you're given incredible freedom to customize and build your characters; even your ITEMS gain their own levels and new skills. You can even fuse characters/items together to break past the old limits of their potential.  It's not a regular RPG where you grind for a linear increase in power, but you use your brain and tinker with multiple systems to gain *exponential* boosts in power. The max level is 9999 for a good reason, not just to extend playtime. Yet this can be very overwhelming to a new player, as unlike Disgaea there's very little indication of what's effective RIGHT NOW, just hints of how godlike you can become later after you've ""cracked the code."" I don't recommend this at all for people who want a comfortable casual time, and to be honest it's too much even for me sometimes. I enjoy this kind of abstract stat manipulation stuff, yet this game was aimed at someone *even more hardcore* than me.It's strange how such an accessible heartwarming story was fused with an inaccessible challenging game. It's definitely not for everyone (if you don't like complicated RPGs you might want to watch a LetsPlay instead). But it's bold and unique, and I love it anyway."

,Recommended,409870,24523270,"Posted: 25 July, 2016",all,Arcana,"Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ it finally happened.The game runs at a stable 60 FPS for me, and it looks/plays just as good as it did in its past three iterations. I waited roughly 10 years for a PC release, and here it is now, not disappointing me in the slightest. I could not be any happier right now.Kind-of-quick general story/gameplay summary for new/unfamiliar players:The story takes place in the world of Ivoire, and revolves around Marona, a 13-year-old Chroma (a mercenary that takes on odd jobs for payment) who can summon Phantoms to battle for her. She lost her parents eight years before the story kicks in, and lives in a blissful version of hell called ""I love to help everyone but no one else likes me,"" thanks to her ability ""Chartreuse Gale,"" which allows her to summon and talk to Phantoms. She commonly gets underpaid for this reason (despite working hard to complete the job), and basically everyone who knows of her refers to her as ""The Possessed One"" instead of using her actual name. She travels with her Phantom, Ash, who ""died"" along with her parents in the prologue, but was saved fromactualdeath when Marona's father turned him into a Phantom before they all got killed. Ash now watches over and protects Marona as she takes on her Chroma jobs and tries to win everyone who hates her over with kindness.The game plays like a ""turn-based"" RPG in battles. Characters appear in a queue, with faster characters being able to attack first. You move your character around in a defined space, perform an action (attack, heal, etc.), move again if you have not already depleted your movement range, and then end the turn. Enemies follow this process, as well. Back on the home island, you can recruit new Phantoms, get healed, buy new items and weapons, and so forth. And on the world map, you can choose what (unlocked) locations you want to visit and play in.Oh, and since this is a Nippon Ichi Software game, you can grind your characters all the way up tolevel 9,999. So, if you like being the physical manifestation of overpowered super death, that is something to work up to. I personally have never managed to accomplish this feat before, but goddammit, I will this time.Also, this version includes 100% of the content created for this game. Everything from the base PS2 version and from the versions that were later made for the PSP and Wii are present here. If you want the ""complete"" game, then you will want to buy this one.All in all, this is a game that will absolutely rob you of countless hours of your life. But in a good way, so it is very much worth it in the end."

,Recommended,409870,24636870,"Posted: 31 July, 2016",all,Ryotaro Dojima: Ace Detective,"I have bought this game 4 times throughout its life and beaten the story multiple times. I don't need to play through the game again to prove that I love this game. But I can at least vouch for the port.Phantom Brave isn't a perfect game or a masterpiece. It's not too hard to make the game easy, and the battle system, while different, isn't the deepest out there. That all said, the game is great and I highly recommend getting it if you're interested in a more serious SRPG compared to Disgaea.The story centers around Marona and her guardian phantom: Ash. Much of the themes of the game revolve around prejudice and hope. Marona constantly gets burned by the people she helps, as their hate for what they see her as makes them treat her like dirt. Despite constant absue, Marona sticks to her parents' ideals they taught her in the hopes that she will one day be rewarded for her efforts. While it may be a bit irksome for some to have her be so optimistic, I do find it at least grounded by the fact that she's not inherently that pure. It is because of the support of Ash that she is able to hold on to these ideals; not because she's some pure person who can take all of this on her own. The secondary story, titled Another Marona, isn't quite as good as the main one. It does shed a bit of light on all the characters that one couldn't see in the main storyline, so it does offer something to those that enjoyed the characters and wanted to see more of them.The meat and bones of the game is the gameplay. The battles play out in a turn based format on a girdless field. Characters have a set limit to their movement represented in DMs, but can move as many times as they want until the number of DMs is fully depleted. You can summon phantoms by confining them to various objects on the field, which grant certain bonuses. Phantoms have a set number of turns they can stay in battle, and when that depletes they leave the battle. Marona is the only character that stays on the field permanently, though there are ways to make some phantoms stick around as long. Attacks themselves have various ranges and AOE ""shapes"" in which they can effect the field. If you find the going to get rough, then you can pick up and throw allies to better position them, or even toss enemies out of bounds at the cost of slightly empowering the other enemies(though the last enemy standing is immune, if I recall). Any items that a phantom has been confined into has a chance of being ""stolen"", as well.There also a number of sub systems within the game. Titles can be bestowed upon any phantom or weapons you have, and each title has various stat bonuses. Some titles even contain special attack skills. You also enter random dungeons, fuse items and titles, and migrate any non-unique skills. There's a lot of customization available to players in this game. You can also ""reincarnate"" characters, which resets them to level one, but allows you to increase their base stat points in order to increase their overall strength.The visual design is one of the few things that doesn't quite hold up. Sprites are somewhat simple, but not particularly ugly(unless you don't disable the filter they use in the options). That character design is pleasant, and there's a lot of variety in overall character design. The background art scales up well, and looks quite lovely. The game performs well, too, with easy 60 fps in most situations.The audio design in the game is quite good. The English voice actors for the main story perform quite well, and the voices fit their characters. There's also a Japanese voice option for those who do not like dubs. The Music in the game is pleasant, varied, and is arguably some of the best that composer Tenpei Sato has put out in quite some time.In terms of replayability, Phantom Brave has a lot to offer. There are a lot of items to collect through confining, characters to unlock, titles to find, and even a New Game Plus option. Delving through dungeons to power up can take a lot, or a little(if you know what to do), time.In summation: The game is a great value at $20. The story, gameplay, and audio are great, with only some bits of the visuals not holding up quite as well. The port is functional, runs well, and contains all the content from every iteration of Phantom Brave. This is the definite experience, and is well worth your consideration."

""Heavens Garden"" makes me tear up sometimes.The overall game formula is a fairly standard isometric turn-based SRPG, with a few twists:No gridlines. Movement range is a circular radius, most attack ranges/AoEs are spheres or cylinders.Having a ""Movement Radius Remaining"" meter has some fun use cases on slippery terrain, you can ""skate"" to move further than you'd normally be able to.The ""OB"" mechanic! Some generic monster causing you problems? Pick it up and throw it off the edge of the map!Careful, though. Chucking enemies off the edge causes their buddies to gain levels.(Oh, and they can throw YOUR guys off the map too!)The story and voice acting are about ""generic anime""-tier, but Marona as a character is really endearing.It's more about Marona growing up as a person, and being able to make it on her own.The ""save the world"" part feels a little ancillary, and that's okay!I wish they'd upscaled more of the sprites in the PC port, some of them look pretty blurry when upscaled to 1080p.The background art looks beautiful though. The PDF art book is a nice touch; a bit overpriced, but a lot of content.As far as controls go: Plug in a PS3 or PS4 controller. The default controller mappings are identical to the PS2 controls.For Disgaea fans: The level cap is still 9999 in this one.Laharl and the gang make cameos in the post-game."

This game has everything you could want of a super rpg. If you are a fan of Disgaea, this game will appeal to you. They have found ways to add twists to a number of common RPG tropes such as:Turn based tactic battles with free movement (No grid!)Over 400 skills which can be given to any character/item in the game for full class customization.Stat bonuses change drastically from battle to battle.Stats other than ATK and INT are used to calculate damage.Healers reign supreme!Ultimately this game is all about customizing an army and gives you enormous freedom in how you choose to do that. My primary complaint would be that the enemy AI can be sad sometimes. Surviving a battle simply because the enemy didn't do anything isn't very satisfying. Fully exploring this game will take well over 100 hours. Many of those hours will probably involve you wandering around your island aimlessly because you forget what you were just doing :)"

While some people might not enjoy only having units on the field for a limited number of turns, it really forces you to think carefully about how you build up your party and how you approach different battles. On top of that Phantom Brave has a really good story as well. It can geel a bit sappy at times, but is probably one of the more touching stories I come across in a game."

The clothing she's folding are stained! I always never gave it any thought and just thorught it was a weir dintro but her clothing isn't just oddly patterened it's actually damaged and she just brushes it off.I like those penvic thrust bottels are neat o.... Wow merchant is a girl?, She's wearing some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ clothing lmao. I always thoguht it was just some dude. ahahaHey you can get free money for doing things on the island try pressing l to jump around. Walk up to Marona and press J to pick her up. Then hop on up the house with l. you get a bit of money. Press J again to throw her onto thge highest part of the house. Then L to jump onto her. Jumping on people damages them haha. Jump on her head and jump onto the tree for a free magic book weapon thing. Make sure to equip it after this first tutorial. Don't sell it's a good item that upgrades with some decent spells later on. Make sure you make a fresh save here, You can also go up to that green sqare up on the hill next to the house and jump on it and up while standing on it to get a bit more BOR. You can also just walk and fall into the water near there to the left of that green box sticking up if you dont' move the camera it's to the left. This is behind the house by the way and you get another 100 BOR. Jump up and down on the camp fire/ garden patch near the house for another 100 BOR.Uhhhh... This is hard to admit now that my life is together but I was a real video game loaf during childhood, I spent A LOT of time on this game. I think I totalled about 5000 hours between all my saves. My first ps2 was lost during a move and my save of 2k hours was gone. I was fairly unhappy, mowed lawns until I could buy another ps2 then I went back to grinding.  Suddenly I was a teenager and I had another 3k hour save on my hands. It was time to put it to an end. The reason you ask what could lure me away from my precious Phantom Brave? My parents bought me a computer for school. Well now as a healthy responsible adult I'm ready to just kms. might as well get it over with there goes my life again haha. . .Cons.This isn't the original sound track I really liked that original OST, one of my favorites!

It blows my mind how easy it is to do everything in this game with the mouse. Movement is controlled via WASD like any FPS, or top down game where you move the map/character, and you can control almost every other aspect with just the mouse. The only thing that is kind of awkward is that Jump is assigned to L, but you really only need to use that while you're wandering around the island, so not very important at all.If you are a fan of Disgaea, or played Phantom Brave on the PS2 I would highly reccomend picking it up on Steam."

It's a wonderful game and I thoroughly enjoyed it.+ Great story, though mileage withdoormatMaronakins may vary for the first chapter or two.+ No grid combat, instead using free-form movement with various aoe shapes. Not only refreshing, but I found myself liking it more than the way Disgaea does it.+More post game content than the Disgaeas I've played: the Hermuda isle and a whopping 12 EX missions.+ 2 story modes, similar to how Disgaea2 DHD does it. One for the main game, and one with greater difficulty added in the remakes.+ So many skills. So many cool skills.= Main character Marona is your only normal character. She ""confines"" her phantom allies into items strewn around the field, and those phantoms have turn limits before being removed. I didn't mind it, but it means pouring all your efforts into a single character can cause you trouble if she gets removed.= Item World is again, the end-all for leveling. This time for leveling items and titles. Different items have different aptitude%s for both equipping and confining into, and these can be incrementally increased by fusing items. Getting over 100% equip% for any stat takestime. Titles stack with this, and can provide various skills. Stats too of course. I found grinding these less taxing than grinding innocents, and felt more accomplishment for doing so.= (post game) Character stats mean little compared to those granted by equipment (and this in a series where it already doesn't count for much). I found leveling characters just didn't matter, except for stealing.= Speed stat God stat. Lacking attack power doesn't matter if your character gets 10 turns before your enemies' first.– Magic skills look disappointing when compared to their Disgaea equivalent. (except Omega Thunder)Play it, enjoy it. The main game does not require grinding if you play smart. So if you don't enjoy grinding, you can still get your worth."

The whole side plot was wishy-washy and a chore to go through for me. Thankfully, the main game was just as good as I last remembered it, which made the purchase worth it. Maybe this way of storytelling appeals to some people, but if you're planning to get this game to try Another Marona like I did, be prepared for a huge contrast in the tone of the story.Other than that, the gameplay is pretty solid, though several in game mechanics can still be exploited (example: climbing on top of enemies may sometimes confuse the AI into not attacking).

It is the development of other characters throughout the story that make it so good.  And of course, because of Marona.  It's quite depressing for the first few chapters.  Then things start going better for her and you love her even more.You won't spend a week resetting to perfect itemsLike Nippon Ichi's Disgaea series, Phantom Brave's items are able to level up and become stronger.  If I compared this to Disgaea 2, this system is 100% better.  Disgaea 2 requires extensive knowledge of how it works and hundreds if not thousands of resets to ""perfect"" your equipment.  It's quite a headache.  Phantom Brave is MUCH simpler.A Blacksmith levels up items and opens skills, a Fusionist combines items together.  That's it.  You can level up items to increase their stats, open a variety of skills and transfer them to other items or characters, combine the raw stats of items together and gain the difference, or increase the efficiency% and confine%.A huge variety of useful skillsReally.  You could spend days just tinkering around with skills, Find hidden gems on absurd items like Rolling Wood on some Driftwood.  Putting together a list of useful skills that work with a particular character's aptitude and stats can make a big difference.  Or you could just have fun with silly stuff.  If you've played Disgaea you will appreciate Phantom Brave's non-grid system, skills have a lot more freedom and are much less restricting and easy to pull off.**BAD**Low resolution spritesAlthough the story scenes have gorgeous high definition backdrops, character sprites are as pixelated as they were on the PS2.  I understand that it would require a lot of work to make the sprites look better, but I wish they could have at least improved on them during cut scenes.  Try to use 4:3 resolution and if you have a huge monitor, play in windowed mode.  That'll lessen how bad it is.***EDIT: These percentages have been added!***(Especially for you PS2 players) efficiency%'s are hiddenThis game's GUI is based on the Wii version.  Yeah, I played this on the PS2, and when I unlocked the Fusionist...I realized they no longer show the percentages.  This is part of the Wii version.  You have to pull out your handy windows calculator.  I forget the name for these if ""efficiency"" is wrong.  Every stat has a % that determines how much of a boost you get from equipping the item.  If your sword with 500 Attack has 50% efficiency in attack, you will gain +250.  By combining items with a Fusionist you can raise that percentage well over 100%.  The hidden percents takes getting used to, and is more confusing for new players who don't understand how the system works.  Phantom Brave supposed to be easy and workable without having to look things up on the Internet.It's too easy to become overpoweredPhantom Brave's systems make over-leveling VERY easy.  You have to limit yourself and make rules for yourself if you want to avoid feeling like you're cheating.  Some of my own rules include no mana farming, no combining with failure titles or higher level items, no confining characters to items you brought with you that are higher level than natural items on the map...really, it is WAY too easy to take advantage of things and become ridiculously powerful.  I also avoid random dungeons when I want to play story mode, instead doing dungeon-only games. (I do this with Disgaea's item world too)Like I said in the first sentence, this is one of my favorite games of all time.  I absolutely recommend this game to anyone, especially fans of other Nippon ichi works."

It does still have some of the issues of being an older game, such as user interface, but it doesn't prevent the game from being enjoyable.Your phantom warriors are limited with how long they can stay in a battle, which adds a unique layer of strategy to the game. You can still limit how many you need to get through the game, but how and when you deploy them is still critical.The free-moving circle grid is also pretty unique for the time and gives a little more flexibility with how to move about the battlefield. It does have some weird situations where things don't work out as the preview shows, but at least you can cancel and try again."

76561198231994704,Recommended,409870,25336241,"Posted: 3 September, 2016",all,Faerador,"**EDITED REVIEW**I initially rated this game as not recommended, due to its port status and the issues that entailed.  Why?  Well, while NIS did some great work cleaning up the backgrounds and menu graphics, they left the original sprites alone.  So, you have these crisp and clear backgrounds, this great text, etc, until the characters walk on the screen.  Pixellated what?  It's rather unfortunate.  For all I know, Marona could be Ash!  Seriously, it's not that bad, but it's not exactly great either.Further, rather than port the PS2 version or even the PSP version, the team at NIS chose to port the WiiU version (again, as they did this for Disgaea, but at least Phantom Brave didn't have the launch issues Disgaea did).  Here, rather than being glitchy and almost unplayable for a month or two, the menus leave out some important information that was included in the PS2 and PSP versions, which wasn't included in the WiiU.One such glaring omission occurs when trying to fuse two items together using the Fusioner's mechanics.  Fusion is already an obtuse and obfuscated mechanic already, so to hide your weapon's base equip percents is ridiculous (look to the discussion boards to see that a majority of players are flummoxed and befuddled by this omission).Fortunately, the base stats are shown, and the altered stats due to the equip percents, so if you're good with math, you'll be able to make the calculations necessary to determine your raw equip percents.But again, why choose to port the worst version?  Likely because it's the most recent, I suppose, and the one the devs are most familiar with, so I understand the choice.  But really, don't just port and run, D-bags; there are always issues with old games getting ported, which might need more care than a simple ""port-and-done"" schema.I hope the devs don't pull this same BS with their other NIS titles they plan to ""bring to PC.""  But I'm sure they will.  And I, the fool, will probably still buy it and recommend it.  Why?  Well, when you've got the only game in the house I'm interested in, this player's gotta play...  So, I'll cautiously recommend this game to previous owners of the title, and those who enjoy NIS or SRPGs.Editor's note:  So, my main gripe about not seeing item equips in fusions was updated recently.  Apparently the staff at NISA agreed with my and other gamers' opinions and redid that particular part of the game to be like the PS2 version, showing the item equip % values.  So, the game is improved (though Marona still looks like Ash!).  Yay, dood!"

Having turn-based combat not bound to tiles was a bold experiment, but in my opinion it failed.- It is sometimes very difficult to select the object you want to target, especially when they stack- Finding the right spot for your character to use an AoE attack effectively is a chore- You have hardly any way to block enemy movement, so you can't properly protect your more fragile characters- The mob AI has some serious problems. Far too often you have enemies which don't do anything on their turn even though they would have plenty of viable options.I really would have liked to keep playing this game for the stories and character progression, but I just don't enjoy the combat system."

,Recommended,409870,33382050,Posted: 8 July,all,defective pancake,"I think it's necessary to split the review for this game into two parts: the story part (as most people do, in fact, play games for the story) and the gameplay part. I think both of them are great, as far as japanese SRPGs go.The story revolves around a young girl named Marona who's lost her parents and has a spirit guardian named Ash filling the role of her older brother and sort of mentor/protector. Ash is a ghost whom only Marona can see, and the only being who cares and looks out for her. Most of the people Marona encounters consider her an abomination for seeing ghosts and talking to them. She also gets incredibly brutal and unfair treatment because she's seen by everyone as an orphan girl with a freaky and dangerous power. Despite that, she never gives up. No matter how harsh the people treat her, how difficult and unfair her circumstances are, she endures them all, and when you play the game, it feels incredibly genuine and not just because Marona is ""such a nice and friendly girl!"". Her willingness to help those who are treated even less fairly than she is, those who are struggling, is genuine and heart-warming, and it's Marona's own way to cope with all the harsh treatment and loss she has to endure. It's a tale of a very selfless girl whose kindness knows no bounds, and perhaps her kindness would inspire the players in turn.The gameplay relies heavily on grind, which is a staple for Disgaea series and its spinoffs. However, the gameplay takes its own unique turn with Marona's abilities to summon spirits, or ""phantoms"" who fight alongside her, as well as picking up stuff scattered around the stages to use as weapons, alongside the usual weapon choice like swords, spears and staffs. Even a measly rock and a random weed have an incredibly power lying dormant in them! Which is, of course, pretty awesome. Leveling up weapons also offers the player an opportunity to completely break the game because you're free to make them as overpowered as you desire. The phantoms can only be summoned for a limited number of turns, and Marona can only summon a limited amound of those from her roster, so you have to plan out many of the more difficult fights ahead (or keep replaying till you get them right). The stages also offer your units opportunity to more or less free roam, which is slightly more confusing when it comes to positioning compared to grid and more predictable and fixed positioning.Difficulty level expects you to grind a lot and can get pretty brutal if you don't commit enough to grind, and straight out impossible if you choose to neglect grinding altogether. If you don't enjoy grinding, this isn't the game for you.The soundtrack is incredibly nice and has an easy-going, yet somewhat somber and melancholic feeling to it; it's never about pure carefree joy, which further enhances the general direction of the story and Marona's character. It also makes even the sloggiest of the stages and the grindiest of grinds a better experience.The graphics, however... Well, the 3D part of the stages looks ok, as well as the backgrounds; unfortunately, pixel sprites are blurry and feel very out of place because of said blurriness. The PC version is pretty much an emulation of the PS2 game, which PB originally was, and it's definitely not meant to be viewed on modern HD monitors. Which is a shame, because the sprite work is really detailed and varied, but it turns out to be such a mess on the actual screen.Overall, the game is really good if you're willing to commit effort to grind. The only downside I can really point out is the blurry pixel sprites, which is a glaring shame on a game that's otherwise pretty much flawless."

If you love strategy games and aren't too picky about the graphics of a game over its story, you'll just enjoy this game overall."

Phantom Brave is a strategy game that has a lot to it, you just have to look for it. What I mean it, you'll be figuring out you can do more than just a handful of what they're showing you. Looking at it now as an adult, I can say that this game is very extensive.It's fun, has a great soundtrack, and has a beautiful story."
,Recommended,409870,31945599,Posted: 24 May,all,LightForce,"This game is a real blast from my past! I remember playing this as a kid, and revisiting it years later, it still holds up really well. If you're here for the mix of dark and silly humor of the Disgaea series, you aren't going to find it here. Sure, the story has its funny moments, but for the most part it's a bit more on the serious side, and there's nothing wrong with that. Great characters, nice voice acting (my man Steve Blum's here, and that always helps!), and a decent story to move you through the gameplay.Gameplay is the real reason to be here, though. Simple yet deep, Phantom Brave shines in inviting and personalized combat and team structure. Tons of different unit types to start and even more to unlock makes it easy to customize your team exactly the way that you want. The only equipment that you need to worry about is your weapon, but you can use everything from standard RPG Swords, Axes, and Spears to weirder options like Books, Scrolls, and Logs, to things that don't make sense like Trees, Trolley Cars, Weeds, and even other units! Tons of special attacks, lots of units specialization through the Fusion system, and easy access to almost every item make it easy to try and blend everything!Combat doesn't take place on a grid; instead, your units have a circular distance count and can move anywhere on the map on their turn within that circle on their turn, making positioning more fluid, and position strategy is as precise as you want it to be. This is helped by your deployment system: Rather than having a whole army on the field, you have your main character, who summons units (Phantoms) into objects on the battlefield. After a few turns, they'll vanish, leaving room for another ally. So you can have as many allies on standby as you want to make, and pick the best for any situation.This review doesn't truly do the depth of the game justice. But it's a great, deep, interesting game with a lot to offer to anyone who's a fan of the genre, and is looking for something fun, but different in terms of gameplay and customizeability."

I still recommend it because it's a good change of air from your usual comedy like Nippon Ichi games.Gameplay: Much like Disgaea but having some unique elements such as free movement, picking up items\weapons scattered around maps, the main heroine's ability: Confine spawning her phantoms in objects (as well having their stats affected) and having a limited about of turns for your phantoms to persist and even corpses that you defeat or get defeated.You better get used to 50 population in your main hub island, it takes a bit of time and patience.Music has always been a strong component in Nippon Ichi games and it never fails.Overall it's a good game, haven't got any trouble running, steady 60 fps, not a single crash and can turn off some settings."
