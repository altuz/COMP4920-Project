The diverse races and sexual orientations for its characters set this apart from a lot of other games. Ash, Prude, and the gang all feel very real and the voice acting cast is really good too. I'm finding myself craving another chapter and look forward to supporting this game in the future."

Great art work, very good story telling well worth the price there asking for it. Even has a blooper reel at the end after the credits. The only down side I can think of it's only part one. At the end they leave you wanting more. Seen 2 of the endings so far very different from one and another which is really great. Would highly reccomend it to give it a try!"

You can easily empathize with the characters which are very diversified personalities.The price and the tag ""part 1"" could confuse it with an episodic game, but it is a complete story arc. Think of it like book 1. It's length of 6 hourse is quiet entertaining and compared to other products the price could even be higher.Only thing i hope for part 2 is that we can influence romance options and who you end with."

The world draws from some classic tropes and mixes them together in a lovely blend. And yet, despite how unique the setting is, exposition never bogs down the dialogue. The writing explains things naturally, without feeling rushed or full of itself. With the exception of a few moments, every plot twist or character motivation makes sense.Brilliant Shadows is marked as book one. I worried this would mean a cliffhanger ending, but that’s not the case. The ending leaves you wanting more without feeling cheap, just like the first book in a great fantasy novel trilogy should.Even if you’re not a huge visual novel fan (I’m certainly not), pick this up.Oh, and the blooper real at the end is amazing. Seriously. Stick around and watch it. You’re welcome."

I know that there's reasons for them to feel connected in the story, but the ending felt empty because of lack of development between those two characters.I definitely recommend this to VN fans and those who enjoy fantasy/romance."

Presenting a very different world from the norm in most media, with Necromancy not necessarily being evil but instead another school of magic that's balanced out by Light magic, the game does a good job presenting the basic principles of the world at a good pace, and the player also gets the opportunity to learn more about the world if the right choices are made.I learned that the voice acting in the game (FULLY voice acted) was actually a stretch goal of it's kickstarter, and I have to say it helped breath life to the characters, and it was quite refreshing to hear new and different talent in an industry that sometimes feels only a handful of voice actors are always given work. (I hear voice actors like Jennifer Hale and Steve Blum across a LOT of titles, across different mediums, and while definitely great voice actors, it's once again so refreshing hearing new talent).  While the writing can also stand on it's own, the acting definitely helps you understand what kind of personality each character exhibits, and makes them that much more memorable. From the character designs to the backgrounds, the artstyle is also beautiful to look at, and speaks of the artist's talent in presenting this world and the people who live in it.There are some games, or even TV shows, that you can play or watch for a while, and then you need to take care of something else. Then there are others that grab your attention so much that you forget where the time went, or you're compelled to finish in one sitting. This is one of those games. I finished my first playthrough until the wee hours in the morning (totally worth it xD). I'm so glad this is part one, as I cannot wait to see what else this indie dev will bring out next in the story."

If you're like me, a devoted fan of anything fantasy-relatedandyou're currently looking for a refreshing, non-anime visual novel, then Brilliant Shadows is an audiovisual treat you will surely enjoy.Pros:One of the few VNs I have played with voice acting, and it certainly did it right with an array of skilled VAs at that. They added more personality to the already well-developed characters.The art is just so beautiful and amusing. Certain scenes make you just want to step back and stare. The vivid colors breathe life into the already compelling story.The setting, the characters, as well as the fantasy world they have built and introduced is more than enough for you to take in in a single chapter visual novel.I greatly welcomed the character diversity, with its mild LGBT themes. It made every character special, and even relatable, in their own way.Provides you more than enough hours to complete all possible endings and read through all of the dialogues.With all of the rich content (and more!) packaged into one visual novel, the full price is well worth it. Kind of makes me guilty that I got this on sale.Cons:The art in some of the scenes were too good, I kind of wished they would be 'unlocked' and easily viewed after reading them.Related to my first con, I personally found the text size too big and awkward, as they covered some of the art.Some of the choices feel too limited, and have little impact on the ending you will get.Small typos and differences in text and voice acted lines.Overall Rating:8.5/10Thank you, Ithaqa Labs, for creating such a wonderful visual novel! I shall be eagerly awaiting chapter two."
,Recommended,409920,33308351,Posted: 6 July,all,Daybreak,"Brilliant Shadows is a Visual Novel set in a medievalesque fantasy setting. Spurting an intellectual vacuum for drama to unfold.The game employs beautiful artwork, both colorfully vibrant and more dark and ominous when the narrative dictates it, moreover this is also skillfully portrayed in the different emotional states the characters go through. The soundscape and voice acting also lends its own share of magic to produce an enthralling narrative. The main cast is well fleshed out and stroke me as adequately multidimensional. There are three different endings to the game depending on what choices you pick throughout the game, they seem to control the protagonists outlook on life, if she'll turn out good or ""evil"".There's a free prequel Embers of Magic on steam that gives a short but well presented idea of what to expect of this VN, even if it's tone is more lighthearted.This VN doesn't have an auto-play function, apparently due to engine limitation, which almost made me put the prequel aside, I am glad I didn't. In the long run it didn't annoy me too much as every character was voiced in both the prequel and in this VN."

But, after picking this up, my entire view has been thrown against the wall. While originally I was concerned that adding in visuals voices to character would take away enjoyment, I have discovered that instead being given a concrete step upon which to envision my characters was refereshing. And I haven't even got to the story itself. Going into this, I was unsure as to if this was going to be a rather generic fantasy story, but BS's (Yeah, great initals for a game right?) openess and more realistic approach to topics such as homosexuality and love had me much more inthrawled into the different characters relationships. And being able to control the main characters actions stripped that sense of when you read a book and you cant tell exactly what's going to happen because a character does something and then spending the next five minutes whining about their stupidity.

I completed the good path, don't care for the neutral, and my friend completed the evil path because she's a toot and I can tell you a LOT about this visual novel.First off, it's more like a book, less like a visual novel as visual novels tend to have 3-6 endings deciding whats your waifu, this is not one of those visual novels.  In fact, if you hate visual novels but love books, pick this up.  It's basically a book because the writing is REALLY well done.I'm going to stop rambling and make more readable explanation off the bat.  I hate, HATE visual novels.  They are disgusting anime waifu trash that pits a male protagonist in a room with ten half-naked cutsie girls of various personalities and animal ears... or tanks... or ships.  Whatever floats their boat I guess.  However, this is not one of those stories. Your character first off, is a woman, and though she has a heavy romantic interest with a character, it is just one specific character and not the waifu tray to choose from.In fact, that's what makes this story so great.  The romance COMPLIMENTS the story, where as most visual novels, the story compliments the romance... or is just kinda shoveled on... looking at you Bird simulator dating... crap.See, it sparks a tension in the pages you read through.  Deliciously juicy drama but no clear indication of 'will you get the girl or not', in fact, there is this dreadening atmosphere as you FEEL the character's hopes and dreams scatter multiple times but she picks herself up time and time again.  It's a really good heartening experience.Now let me explain the characters role.Main character: An interesting and dynamic character.  She FEELS so real, and her attitude can change from spiteful and depressed to straight up malicious depending on your choices.  I have felt her concerns myself in the dating gig so I know how it is.Love interest:  A character where drama revolves around but she isn't the driving force behind the plot (not directly anyways).  She brings the main character's tension along and is a point of interest, but isn't a mary sue princess that needs saving.The 'will he betray us' guy:  Okay, sometimes you see a 'plot twist' coming from a mile away.  Sometimes you think 'no it's building up to reveal he was the good guy all along.  It isn't obvious in this one, it just isn't.  Sometimes I'm like OH YEAH HES SO GOOD, and other times I'm like HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥STAB HIM HES SO EVIL!  But I didn't know, I never did until the end segment. I'm not going to spoil whether he is a good guy a bad guy.The tag along characters: Well, these two people are basically extra spicing to flesh things out.  They fufill their role... they flesh things out, they add more dynamics but they are indeed, tag along.  Don't expect too much from them as they are a basic package.  NOthing too interesting but they add more perspective.  All in all well done characters if, a bit dissapointing.I'd describe more characters but I feel that it may be too spoilery so let's just say this.  Some characters will be completely meaningless and useless, while others will actually have a lot more involved with the plot than you would first think.  So just play it safe and pay attention to all characters :3Now, the story itself.  The plot is very interesting.  Once more, I won't describe in detail what it is but I will say the beginning is WAY Too slow and the ending is WAY too abrupt.  That's my only complaint, your first hour will be spent reading the beginning while the next will be speeding by the middle and the end as the plot snowballs down.  The story and even the world itself however, is very facinating and this DOES excuse the speed and pacing.  The beginning had to EXPLAIN the world, show you how it is.  And it doesn't do it in a stupid♥♥♥♥♥naruto way, no... it expects the reader to be actually intelligent and piece things together with solid information.  So that perhaps may be why the beginning is so slow and the ending feel so sudden and fast paced.TL;DR?Story 8/10Pacing 7/10Romance 9/10Characters 10/10World 10/10IGN 7.8/10.  Too much water"

This was actually one of the first VNs where I cared more about what would happen next then what ending I wanted to get, which I was not expecting at all.I feel it's probably good to get all the cons out of the way first, because there aren't too many, and they are balanced out well.First off, the voice acting and diologue sometimes seem a little bit amateurish. It doesn't come up too often, but occasionally you get the idea that these people have not done this before, and aren't too settled in it.Secondly, there are some times when you really start to feel the exposition heavily. This is mostly when characters are talking about how sexuality is viewed in the world, and they are speaking more towards the reader than what someone would naturally say in the situation.And finally, there are one or two choices where it's not entirely clear what you are selecting. Nothing too drastic, or that would get you a suprise bad ending, but I did get surprised at what happened from a few choices.Those issues, however, are pretty few and far between. And never so drastic to break the narrative, which is really uite good.The plot is first class. Period. This is a well realized world, with a lot of things left unexplained that make it feel more alive. You can tell a lot of thought went in to all of it, and it pays off. The story going on in this world, too, has a couple of good twists, but also the meat to keep you going between them. The twists are also payed off quickly enough that you don't feel like anyone is particularly stupid. And, despite being the first part, it has a fairly satisfying ending, without any cliffhangers stapled on to the end.The characters are also quite good, and all the mains seem to have greater depth than I normally expect from this type of game. They also deal with some issues that are rarely addressed by any game, which I won't spoil, but really struck me as things that real people deal with more often than is represented.The art is great. Pretty much perfect. Each character has many expressions that fit whatever is going on at the time and nothing is reapeated enough to seem lazy or anything. It also just looks gorgeous.And finally, the voice acting. Yes, I mentioned there are some less than great moments, but when it is good, it is really really good. The voice actors definately care about their characters and care about doing well, which is missing from some games with much bigger budgets. Nobody is bored and nobody is phoning it in, and everybody gives the emotional stakes they need to. Also, The mains have very nice voices to hear.All in all, a great VN, not exactly the Dating sim I had expected, but it fulfilled that need and so much more.Also, blooper reel at the end, very good!"

,Recommended,409920,19141562,"Posted: 18 November, 2015",all,Wertsir,"6/10.The game starts out good, the voice acting is great and the art is sufficient.While the setting is unique the game has a lot of similarities to bad fanfiction, (the primary characters are significantly more powerful than any other character in the game doing things that seem 'impossible' to other characters in the setting, they fall prey to 'special snowflake' syndrome, (ash doesn't know who her pairing is for most the game, merely that they are mysterious and extremely powerful, she is capable of ressurecting plants something noone else can do, as well as inexplicably being capable of casting spells and magics that others can't, handily defeating foes that would have killed her otherwise. Prude is a princess, and is the object of half the primary casts affections. Hek is stronger than the Heads of the school, and has powers that essentially have 'mary sue' written all over it. SPOILERS, DO NOT READ PAST THIS POINT: Ash's pairing partner turns out to be a changeling/elf thing, and not only does it handily solve the final confrontation, but it also saves their lives thruoghout the entire game, demonstrating overwhelming power and skill for no reason, this character, (as we have seen it so far) is just a straight up mary sue, she has no real negative characteristics, being an extremely power magical creature, when she meets her ash seemingly just decides that she is over prude, dismissing what had up until that point been a major plotpoint) to further reinforce this similarity to fanfiction is the 'pairing' itself, which anyone with a passing familiarity with the Harry Potter fandom will probably recognize as a extremely cliche trope of that genre, it's essentially just soul-bounding or veela mates or whatever other flavor they choose to call it that week, with the pairing making both parties stronger, as well as somehow magically determining that they are 'destined for eachother' or some bullcrap like that. This makes the overall story feel weaker, at least for me, but since it is the central conceit of the story I will overlook it.You may have noticed that the (horribly rambly) paragraph above is very critical, yet this is a positive review, and there is a reason for that: Hek. Hek single handedly makes this game, his characterization is amazing, and while the rest of the plot is a load of BS Hektor is interesting enough to keep you playing.Overall it's story is nothing special, it's plot being a collection of cliches that have been overused so often that there is no way to take them seriously anymore, but it's still interesting enuogh to pick up.

In fact, I'd probably not pay attention to this game were it not for a YT vid showcasing it in my feed. But it instantly caught my attention with really polished production values for that kind of game- the artwork is detailed, pleasant to eye with good mix of earthy and vibrant tones and manages to vary enough to make it look like it's not all taking place in one white hallroom. The character artwork is animate and expressive (again, within the limitations of the medium- the horseriding sequence really could've used a separate character model) and the style fits the setting of the story.The other thing I have noticed is the voice acting. That is, to my knowledge, a rarity in VN's, and most characters seem to be cast well. A few minor issues with delivery here and there, but nothing glaring. My one real issue would be sound volume- I assume the reason is that the VA's were recording in different studios, but some of the lines sound clear and crisp, while some sound muted or muffled. Still..it's fully acted and the three main characters are very easy on the ear (Hector's performance in delivering the deadpan lines was perfect).Music is very good, and I'd gladly use it as a background for pen and paper RPG session.Now, as to the story itself, it's decent. The writing isn't Hugo-winning, but it got me invested into what seemed at first to be a simple  coming of age story. The characters are all easy to like, the plot flows fairly fast and without major stuttering, and it even manages to build good suspense, and there wasn't a single moment where I cringed...a feat that not all mainstream dev studios manage. The writers were well aware of the trappings of the genre, and delivered a solid story (not without some plotholes) within it. Solid enough that I definetely want the next chapter.I would also love for the world to be more populated. The Mountain seems to be existing in a desolate void. We know there's the kingdom, and in the last few minutes of the story we get rushed attempt as establishing the world, but still, a rough sketch of the world as known by the characters would be great.One minor thing that was slightly grating: Dear writer,we get it. People of all genders, sexes and walks of life have the right to love and should not be prejudiced against. Pretty sure no one who disagrees with that notion will be playing this game, so...spare us the heavy-handed ""only a primitive would"" lines next time, it's preaching to the choir.Despite minor flaws, I'd still recommend the game if you want to read something nice, romance-themed and in fantasy setting. The visuals and soundwork are high quality, and the story solid if not breaking any new grounds. I'd liken the experience to Old Kingdom trilogy in terms of tone, or one of Gaiman's earlier novels, like the Stardust.Do not play if girls kissing girls and not kissing you make you upset."

I didn't care about either of the romances because there wasn't enough build up to them... they just sorta happened?""Hey, I'm suddenly really in love with this guy I got paired with even though I knew next to nothing about him before this!"" ""Hey, girl I've only spoken to a few minutes in changling form, let's date!"" The latter felt like a really cheap solution to the protagonist's problems and IMO, doesn't send a great message?- Inconsistent voice acting quality. The voice acting itself isn't bad, but some of it sounds professionally recorded while other characters sound like their lines were recorded with a really cheap microphone. This was particularly noticeable with Prude, which is unfortuate, considering she's one of the characters who talks the most.Overally, I just thought it was okay. I feel like a lot more could have been done with the story (even as just half of a two-part series)—more world building, more explanation about how magic/pairing works, a lot more build up with relationships, etc. Based on the reviews, a lot of people  seemed to really like this game, but it fell flat for me personally.

The voice acting is well done and it's really refreshing to come across a fantasy that is as diverse at this one. However, for as progressive as it is I am a bit thrown off how other characters seem to treat Hektor.I'm pretty sure he is suppose to be autistic and while I do think it is realistic that characters will be annoyed by him at times. It's a bit jarring to see people hit him and even describe him by using abelist slurs.I'm also disappointed with writing at times. There are moments where there should dramatic tension yet seems to be brushed off or ignored.Two examples, I can think of this is when Prude finds out Hektor is a Gray Mage and is clearly upset about it, to the point of being brought to tears. Yet almost immediately in the next scene we see Prude seeming completely okay by it. Yes, time may have past but the audience still need to see how Prude came to terms with her lover being what she considers a monster. Also, the scene where Ash finds a dead gray mage in her room and the characters seem to talk about it as if they are discussing the weather??? The game tries to explain it away by saying 'they're use to it because it's been happening to them a long time' but this only has been happening to them for a few weeks at most.Also the ending felt rushed. I also think that certain revelation in the end could have been saved for the next part of the game.Ash suddenly being in love with Terra, even with the whole 'pairs' concept, seems unrealistic to me.That's something that could have possibly been developed better in the next part of the gameHowever, despite my complaints the game does have an exciting plot that makes me interested in the next part of the game. And the characters are all interesting and unique which makes you truly care what happens to all of them, even the villians.So, yeah. I think Brilliant Shadows is a cool game that needs just a bit more work with it's writing.3.5/5"

As many dissapointing games do, it had a very promising beginning, with lots of fantasy, magic, school, friendship and so on, but from there it dragged, the writing let it down and the voice acting didn't help either.While there were plenty of good moments, excellent art and music and thought provoking player choices throughout, I felt I couldn't engage with standard fantasy characters talking like millenials, and the twist at the end not only came out of the Big Book of Cliches but felt wildly inconsistent with the tone the game had started in.I'm sure plenty of people will like this game, especially as the music and art are fantastic, but I didn't."

The art is beautiful and the voice acting very well done, but the way characters and plot points line up the the end felt too easy or convinient at times. Not to mention the minor oversights every once in a while of characters changing their clothes with their expressions in between panels. Or voice overs not matching texts (like with Ashley/Swan). I fully intend to give it another try and choosing the ""I want to be a deliberately paranoid, jealous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" options just to see if it balances out or trully makes a difference in the overall game play.Edit: So the Light and Dark endings are very different, and I appreciate that though I'm not sure the dialogue choices I made along the way actually justified the significant split.

At the beginning the protagonist and her true love's relationship is set up very nicely, they're best friends since childhood and now that they're adults they're set to complete their magical bonding ritual which will be the beginning of their lives together.  It's great stuff, you're definitely invested in their relationship.  But something goes wrong, leaving your main character bonded to an alien (who you don't even really meet until near the end of the game) and your true love bonded to a super annoying dude.  Of course that's all OK, since, you would assume, True Love will overcome even the power of magic, and it'll lead to a great and happy ending, or so you would expect.  The problem is, at least in this game, True Love doesn't overcome the bonds of magic, you'll spend the entire game trying to overcome it, but you'll fail at every turn, all your choices essentially lead to the same depressing result.   Eventually your character is simply alone and miserable, and as a conclusion to this terrible story, the only two other lesbian characters in the game are revealed to be bad guys, and your character has to kill them.  But wait, after everything's been terrible and depressing the entire game, at the very end you meet the alien you're bonded to, and, since your character is going to be extremely attracted to it no matter what it looks like because of the power of the magic of the pairing ritual, it's a good thing that it at least appears to be female.  The end.  Of course, the Title suggests that it is 'Part One' so perhaps in the next game your character will be able to finally break the bonds of the 'pairing ritual', get away from the alien and get your true love away from the super annoying dude, and finally live Happily Ever After, but there's no happily ever anything in this Part One, so I'd suggest waiting to see if things get better in the next one before playing this one."

As a bi woman, I usually wince a little at most media in terms of sexual representation: mainstream bisexual representation trends toward the ""out of straight porn"" variety and ""lesbian oriented"" media tends to shame or delegitimize bisexuality and there was none of that in this game. Combine that with an interesting fantasy universe (something that seems like a bit of rarity in VNs that I've seen), a cool and unique idea for a magic system, decent voice acting, and an actually hilarious blooper reel, and this game is definitely a good buy (especially at 50% off)."

For one thing, I don't think there were enough choices. It's a very short game. At times it gets confusing with the dialogue and POV (although that may just me be.) However, I do have to applaud the artwork. It's very Tim Burtonesque."

But if one catches my eye because the design and story I may give it a chance. And I wasn't wrong at all.I just finished it for the first time and got the first ending. Played it 7 hours straight and now my eyes are on fire, but the crying while playing helped to hidrate them.Now in a more serious manner. I loved the characters, really well done, some more likeable than others (maybe some people will like the ones I didn't like and hate the ones I did like), the story had me hooked, all the magic, balance, pairing stuff. It was like a methaphor about human relationships And the suspens made me wanting to know more.The twists got me good, I had some moments flipping stuff from my desk (I have a messy artsy desk don't judge).The jokes were funny, the blooper reel was a really nice touch.So... yeah, I REALLY DO recomment this game. And I'm waiting for the 2nd book!!I'm really happy to been able to get the good ending first since it leaved me with a great sensation."

This one was unexpectedly good.Decided to just test it out a bit before going to bed and ended up playing through the night. I especially liked the voice acting, and it's probably the best one I've come across in visual novels of this price range. A solid 4 hour trip for one of apparently three endings if you let the voice acting play out. And you should."

I'm ecceedingly glad I purchased this and will continue to follow the story!"

I didn't really look into into as I didn't want any spoilers for my first play through and so I was surprised that Ash was a lesbian (didn't see that coming). Even if I personally prefer guys the game was still 100% enjoyable and I would recommend it no matter your sexuality! In fact the story contains a cast of diverse characters in terms of both color and sexuality! The relationships between the characters are all portrayed very humanly and it is such a relatable and enjoyable story. All the characters are great and lovable, I am honestly so glad this game exists!!! Ash is such a strong female model with depth and character, honestly I am in love!!  On top of that the game deals with issues such as romantic rejection especially between people of different sexuality which is not a commonly explored topic in the genre. I am hooked and can't wait for the sequel, Pale Spectrum which is in the works. I have become such a big fan so quickly <3"

I wish there was more interaction besides a few simple choices but the storyline was interesting enough to keep me engaged. Most important to note is the lesbian protagonist and pretty diverse set of main characters.I'm excited for the 2nd installation and hope there's more dependent on player choices."

Despite the ""Part One"" in the title it has proper (albeit very cheesy) endings, although they feel quite rushed.  The LGBT themes are a bit too much on the nose but not overly so."
,Recommended,409920,33811235,Posted: 26 July,all,newblood40,I loved its story and I wasn't expecting the voice acting. It was good acting. I had so much fun with the story and the ideas it contains and the people were so lovey and I would totally recomend this to anyone who isn't homophobic. The art is beautiful as well and I love the side stories of lovers besides the main character's stuff. I can't wait for chapter two but I doubt it will actually come so I might have to write my own version of this story.

It kept me reading until i finished it at 5am on a weekday."
