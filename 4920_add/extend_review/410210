There is absolutely no options menu so you cannot check controls, or change display settings or turn off the god awful music. Steering is all over the place and there is no controller support either, just the letters X and Z on your keyboard and the left/right arrow keys to move. If it was an early access game I'd say ok, it needs more work, but since this is the final product...I cannot recommend it at all. I can't believe Steam allow games like this to exist on the platform. For the love of god, run fast, run far, stay away from this game!"

I loved the Wipeout games, is this a modern take on it?  Sadly not even close.The first problem I encountered is that there are no insturctions on how to play.  I selected the first of what appears to be 3 stages, got in a match against three other racers... and sat there.  The other ships zoomed off, and I was pressing my keyboard and mouse trying to figure out how to move.  I quit out of the game and looked for help, tutorial, anything.  In the end trial and error by pressing every key on my keyboard I discovered ""X"" was the magic key I needed to press to figure out how to go forward.Alright, so no controls are posted.  That isn't a great sign.  Still, now I finally know how to play.  Get ready world.... Wipeout clone here I come.Oh, no, wait.  You only can choose from one ship.  The controls are sluggish.  The tracks are boring.  Wipeout used the vertical element in its track design to great effect.  This game has only a few race tracks to try, and they are bland and no fun to race on.  And at all times I felt like I was fighting poor controls.The worst part though in this generic knockoff tragedy, worse than the lack of instructions, the poor controls, the bland music and the boring race tracks.... is that even once you take the time to really master the game it isn't fun or satisfying.  Hitting an enemy ship with a weapon does not have any sort of satisfying impact.  Hitting boost arrows never leads to those ""breakneck speed chains"" you would expect in a title like this.  In fact, at the end of the day you don't seem to be able to go very fast at all.... in a racing game.I liked some of the particle effects, and it about ends there.  This game is a chore to learn how to play, and even once you do there is no fun waiting to be had in the mastery of the mechanics.1/10"

Simply a minimalistic white background with triangles and numbers. I had to figure out by myself what I was looking at. There's absolutely nothing intuitive in the game. Not to mention the fact that we're obliged to sign up on the devs website before even thinking about starting a race... in a game that doesn't even features multiplayer. But the worst is yet to come...Since there is no option menu I also had figure out the controls by myself. Left arrow and Right arrow are for changing direction but what about acceleration? Isn't it the Up arrow? No it's not! Why would you use the Up arrow in the first place!? Thanks to Shinryu's review on Steam I've been able to start a race without wasting too much time looking for the acceleration key (which is ""X"" by the way).The two first races I played simply look bland, short and repetitive (be careful not to race out of the map). Thanks to the very narrow track there is simply no way to complete the 5 laps without hitting the wall every 5 seconds. Here, the steering would need some tweaking.The visuals are minimalistic at best but at least they fit with the sci-fi setting. During the race I experienced some framerate drops which is unacceptable for a game that looks like a game made in the late 90's (the early 3D cards era). But since it's using the Unity engine, what was I expecting? Also, if you use video capture software the game will freeze during recording.Overall, I would only recommend this game if you're a masochist that promote ""no taste gaming"" like me.I dare you to watch this 3 minutes video to the end!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcMBeg7KRZ4Rating:2.0 / 10"

Unfortunately, while its visuals, ship, and sound designs aren't atrocious, its complete lack of gamepad support of any kind and its clunky keyboard controls are enough to warrant not enjoying the game very much. The game is also quite difficult -more as a result of the controls being shoddy than anything else- but to unlock the next race in a series, you need to get first place in all of the preceding events to accumulate enough points (i.e. Track 4 is unlocked after getting 9 points total, 3 in each preceding track.)While this is standard in other racing games as well, due to Ampersand's garbage keyboard control feedback you'll often be boosting during a race only to go crashing / bouncing off of walls clumsily toward the finish line. Whereas analog stick controller support might lead the player to be able to breeze into sharp corners, narrowly avoiding the wall and gracefully navigating the track, instead with the keyboard you're left to hope that you've let off the gas pedal (mapped to X...) just enough or have frantically pressed the left or right keys to somehow not bounce off of the wall. Whereas other racing games are rewarding when you do figure out ""how fast to go into turn 6"" Ampersand just feels like you're doomed to failure, or that the controls aren't responsive enough to do what you're intending.Ampersand has some potential, but unfortunately it is squandered via the poor controls and feels like more of a waste of time than anything else."

Every time you get a boost and even nudge the wall slightly you lose it. When I started the game, I just was clicking around until it started a race, I still don't completely understand the main menu. When I started the game I pressed every key on my keyboard until I found out that x is to go forwards. Then it was a matter of pressing every other key on the keyboard to figure out that the left and right arrows are left and right and z is to use powerup. If there are other controls or special features, I did not discover them in my first three matches of the game. If you want to spend 14 cents on a good game, buy the 12 Labours of Hercules II: The Creten Bull, it's a much better game."

Most people use controllers for racing games.- No options at all, for binding the controls, etc.- Graphics are PS1 level.- Very unforgiving, if you hit a wall once it slows you down to nothing and you usually cant regain your place.- The physics are wonky, if you hit a boost it goes straight in that direction instead of being able to drift around corners.It's a nice proof of concept but it needs a lot more work before it can be a decent game."

There are a lot of things missing from Ampersand that should be present in any respectable racing game. Hell, there are a lot of things missing from Ampersand that should be present in any game that involves driving, period. A common complaint I hear about this game is that there's no tutorial or manual explaining the function of the buttons or powerups. This is true, and a very valid concern, but I find it much more concerning that Ampersand eschews basic functions of driving such as braking or reversing. Considering an easy 25% of the speed boosts on these tracks will slam you directly into a wall, these would have been helpful things to include. If there's anything nice to be said about Ampersand, it's that it is at least priced in proportion to its quality."

There is no point to the racing, no real progression or goals, the controls are awful (I didn't know for the longest time how to move forward) The graphics are subpar, the bots are way way better than you, the courses are mundaine. On the upside, when i bought this, the game was cheaper than the total of the trading cards I got, but thats not the case anymore so god, dont buy this game. Unless you like really bad games that is."

You can still see ""tap to continue"" all over and I guess the thing on the left is the control buttons. Ports may be good, but they are generally bad. It's so bad that it may not even start on your machine. Sweet black screen.Third. There are 66% negative reviews. Noone in his sane mind would really bother to read through the reviews of a failure. Would you? I wouldn't.Now, as you don't expect anything from this pile of trash, I'll tell you that the game actually tries to relive the days of glorious PS1 Wipeout. I never liked the original game to be honest, but this one actually brings up some nostagia. A random floating ship, a circular track and a complete lack of background mesh - just a static skybox. But it kinda does the job. So if you find out that you should accelerate on Z (or was it X?) and turn with your arrow keys, you'll be able to play it.

Now, I will go over a few of its pro's and con'sPros-The price, as I said, currently its 14 cents-Cool soundtrack-Trading CardsCons-The HORRIBLE controls! x = boost and you use the arrow keys to move!-You can't change the controls-The lack of content-Can't really do much as this game has little to offer other than crafting a game badge for your Steam account.-Looks like a game made for the PS2Sorry this review is short, the game is honestly very little. Overall, if you have a couple of cents to spend, go ahead and buy this if it's on sale."

There are no menus, no list of controls, and absolutely ZERO ways the game communicates ANY information. This game would be better if it was set on fire and used to heat a gaming studio that makes ACTUAL GOOD GAMES"

Just keep that in mind when playing it, it is a 1$ game, not a 50$ or 80$ game made by activision or bethesda or that. 4.5/10"
