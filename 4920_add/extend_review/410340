76561198097708448,Recommended,410340,21845816,"Posted: 14 March, 2016",all,The Ben Obiwan,"======================================EDIT: My original review was in March 2016, and after playing this game I did get into FPV, DEEEEEP... lol, and this sim really helped lock in important skills. I had another look today, and noticed a huge improvement in the tutorial, multiple pre-made quads and general polish across the board. I still can't dive the Hoover Dam, but give them time... Best FPV sim available!======================================This is coming from a hardcore gamer, looking to get into FPV drones because they look like fun,I am enjoying the sim, it seems like a great way to learn how to fly before destroying an actual drone, and I could see it being a fantastic skill improving tool even when flying actual drones regularly.I just have a few things that need mentioning if this game is to be the ""gateway drug"" for gamers becoming FPV pilots, and surely that thought has crossed the devs minds.Firstly, that tutorial is brutal. Maybe coming from a RC background it would be easier, but having never flown a quad-copter before, being put in a box with one window to exit from is the equivalent of learning to pick locks by handcuffing yourself underwater. A typical gamer will need at least half hour in a large open space, preferably with a guide and controller indications explaining how the drone works by performing simple maneuvers ie ""Take off, hover  at same altitude for 10 seconds"" ""Now fly forwards and backwards maintaining altitude"" etc until the basics are natural.Next up, there really needs to be some sort of pre-made drones that handle differently for different levels of skill. Begin with a slow and sluggish drone that is forgiving and easy to fly, then work your way up as your skills improve. I know there is a workshop where I can edit my drone, and options to set motor speeds etc. but these should really be options I fiddle with after I have learned what is what, not while I am struggling to stay horizontal as I smash into another hay bale.Speaking of hay bales. The maps. Seriously, I could be flying anywhere in the world, but here I am in some unbelievably dull locations. I am sure more maps are on the way, but even for RC enthusiasts this can't make much sense. Here are a few map ideas I would be excited to see in the final release:Boat (sinking titanic?)Music festival (maybe Woodstock?)Theme ParkHot Air balloon Show. (Take off from one balloon, and there are 30 others just floating about)Construction tower.Literally ANYWHERE! I understand that this is trying to be realistic, but a game like this also gives you the ability to do things you wouldn't usually be able to do, like fly in public areas full of people, or dangerous locations, and the lines required the fly for racing could be a lot more interesting than markers on the ground, like ducking behind a waterfall to emerge near a roller coaster track, which you must follow for while before shooting into a ghost train tunnel. Gimmicky? Yes, but if just a couple of unrealistic tracks were included, it would be a lot of fun.TL;DR I am enjoying the game, and hope to see it become more approachable, without losing it's realistic simulation edge. I recommend for anyone interested in FPV drone racing.If you're curious how deep I dove into the world of FPV check out this cliphttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipJS-AMC0OQ&t=36sI'm no Matty Stuntz, but I improved quickly thanks to the help of this sim."
,Recommended,410340,32525127,Posted: 17 June,all,Funky Space Man,"I just built a tiny whoop a couple weeks ago as my first real quad. So many crashes. A pine tree jumped out in front of me and almost ate my quad. I needed practice to avoid those agressive pine trees.I had heard good things about liftoff so I thought I'd give it a try. After a about a week of off and on practice on liftoff and I'm flying my tiny whoop in acro mode. not well mind you, but well enough to usually avoid getting eaten by agressive pine trees.All joking aside this really helped me learn to fly my quad. Very well done. I still suck at making it through gates though. (for now)"
76561198015216866,Recommended,410340,25110751,"Posted: 24 August, 2016",all,Lonnopo,"So, where to start?I'm currently sitting on 290 hours on Liftoff and continue to play it every day I can. There are a couple of ways you can approach Liftoff.. as a game, or a tool to use for practicing for real life flight.If you know you are serious about getting into this hobby, I strongly suggest taking the approach of treating it like a training tool. For example, like just about any other skill you can learn, its recommended that you get 1 hour of practice every day to improve your skills as much as possible. That's pretty much how I decided to approach Liftoff, which can even sometimes mean forcing myself to spend a bit flying around even if I don't want to... I know that sounds kind of silly when its simply a video game, but it's definitely payed off.I started playing Liftoff back at the start of the year, and flew in real life for the first time in July and was able to fly acro on my second flight. I'm not saying that to show off, but to show how amazing Liftoff has been for making it so someone can just go out IRL and be comfortable flying a drone at nearly 100km/h (60MPH) without even needing to leave the house.If you are in the category of being interested in FPV but you're not too sure, I'd suggest just buying a cheap transmitter, or even use an xbox controller with a rubber band on the left stick holding it downwards like I first did and see how you are feeling at about the 20 hour mark. That may sound like a lot for just testing a game but you really need to give it a chance until you are able to get your finger coordination down and can start feeling a bit more smooth with your flight.If at any point something ""clicks"" and you realize how much you love it, I'd say start saving as much as you can for a taranis transmitter, or just go out and buy one if you can afford it. This will probably be the best investment you'll make getting into this hobby as you'll be able to use it down the track when you start flying IRL.I don't want to make this too long, so in summary, Liftoff is most likely one of the best investments I have ever made in my life just because of how much money it's saved me. If I had gone out and gotten to the level of flying I'm at now by just flying IRL, then I have no doubt I'd be about 5-10,000 dollars short by now. If I were to add up the costs of the crashes I've had in Liftoff, it would literally be hundreds of thousands of dollars worth.. so if you have seen some FPV videos on youtube, and you are interested I really doubt you'll regret making this purchase.and finally, thanks LugasStudios for this great piece of software. <3Lots of love,Lonnopo"

No issues at this point.  Got a little sim time, and I am no expert in flying.  The options of FPV noise is nice.  The graphics are awesome.  No major issues.  Looking to hook up Spektrum controller later.  Used xBox controller with no issues.  Nice Early Access - I will provide more details as I play more.  #crashatnoexpenseEdit 11/12Got over three hours in the game, and I love it.  I was able to hook up my Dx7s with the helpful discussion post.  I have gained a bit more confidence and even toyed with Acro mode.  The first update was a big difference.

It's already a ton of fun to play and good practice for the real thing. The graphics are locations are especially impressive, and the workbench aspect adds a lot to the experience.The things I would like to see prioritized moving forward are continuing to tweak the physics and adding at least a simple lap timer (ala freerider) so that it is more useful for training, even before the racing aspect is available.Overall, a great sim with lots of potential that is definitely recommended at this price."
76561198306228614,Recommended,410340,23765838,"Posted: 24 June, 2016",all,techcoast,"I have flown in a few different multi-rotor sims and this one is, by far, my favorite. It's not 100% like the real thing, but it's certainly close enough to bring my skills up and make me way more confident on the controls. Learning with a sim is like learning to ride a bike with training wheels. Until you get out there and fly on the real sticks you can't hope to compete. However, this is a great tool to get your confidence up and make you more comfortable for when you do get your hands on the sticks.I've been using this sim for a while now and I'm certainly learning more and more. Each time I fly my quad I'm more and more confident and that's come way faster than just flying once a week for a few packs thanks to this sim.There's never a substitute for the real thing, but this is certainly something to help get your there and even help sharpen your skills when you get there."
76561198296614622,Recommended,410340,30670261,Posted: 22 March,all,patrick.joyce,"First, I do have some credentials to mention, perhaps to add some validity to the review.  I served 6 years in the Air Force and while stationed in Italy in 1976, I joined a group of Italian hang glider pilots I found while driving in nearby mountains.  I bought a hang glider, flew 5 times from a 2500 foot peak, and then crashed and broke my arm. The military took care of me, and I'm okay.  Years later, I discovered flight simulators on an Apple II computer (SubLogic FS2). I've used simulators ever since then to an exhaustive degree.  In 2004 I had the means to start flight lessons, and obtained a Private Pilot license in 2006.  I put about 80 hours in command of rental planes (Cessna 150, 152, 170, 172M, 172P) and then got training in a Weight-Shift Control sport aircraft.(commonly called a trike) and then I bought one, N502PW.  I flew 100 hours in the trike over the next 5 years, then sold the aircraft in 2014. I have a Phantom 3 Standard quadcopter, a Spedix 275 FPV racing drone, a Vortex 250 FPV racing drone, a Blade NanoQX FPV mini, a Blade InductrixFPV, and an FPV Tiny Whoop I made from an Inductrix.  My FPV videos are on YouTube at patjoyce7323.Liftoff is one of the most remarkable simulator products I have ever used.  It has the closest feel to the actual experience of controlling an FPV drone.  There are no ""anomolies"" or odd glitches when you use the controls aggressively.  The most remarkable thing about LIFTOFF is the support from Steam and the Steam Community.  I bought the software for only $20 (compare to MS flight simulator $60+ ) and was able to use my really old ""Real Flight"" USB controller from 20 years ago!  That controller is not always compatible with other simulators, but works great in Liftoff.But again, the greatest thing, is how LIFTOFF has been IMPROVED since I installed and started using it.  LIFTOFF has amazing graphics.  Other simulators cut back a bit on the realism and the details, so that they can build a more expansive landscape filled with all of the actual structures that are there in the real world.  Liftoff is so designed to get the best balance of landscape detail (3d objects) and computer performance.  You can customize the complexity of the graphics displayed so that you can increase the frame rate of the simulation.  The physics are completely accurate.  You can build a new quad completely from scratch and save it.  You can select parts such as frames, motors, props, batteries, antennas, etc.  You can adjust the FPV camera angle, add a Mobius or GoPro on top, then go fly your customized quadcopter.Back to the landscapes.  There are many environments provided for you to fly.  Each one is very different from the others.  The first ""Straw Bale Field"" is wide open space with no trees (except for a few outside the fence).  The bales of hay provide a clear ground reference.  The next environment has tall pine trees so you can learn obstacle avoidance and more advanced maneuvers.  The next is flying inside one level of a parking garage to teach you to manage your altitude carefully.  There were several more beautiful environments (a pro football stadium, for example) but here is the beauty of all this... they keep giving you more environments as they are developed.  And the latest one, called Hannover, is like the bando heaven we all seek.  No people, just awesome open places to fly and hone your skills.  The windows have reflections, and the level of detail is as good as it gets. There are lots of areas filled with trees, different sizes, types and colors, with gaps both big and small, and not always predictable, to challenge your flying skills.I have not ever used the Multiplayer feature, or competed in races, all of which I am sure are worlds in and of themselves, with a huge number of tracks available for download.  LIFTOFF has a builder feature which allows you to build your own track in any of the environments.  Tracks can be saved and shared.  I've build a few tracks, and honestly, it takes a while to learn how to move and place the flags, gates, and markers, but in the end, you have a really nice race track that is exactly what you need.  Then you go fly your own track, and since you can edit tracks, you can always come back later to make improvements and adjustments.In short, this simulator will make you a better pilot.  And it accurately portrays the experience of performing FPV quadcopter flying.  If you like the DRL product, you will enjoy LIFTOFF even more.  Worth it at twice the price."
76561198002186348,Recommended,410340,33763168,Posted: 24 July,all,Debugger,"It's a very good simulator. I have found a bunch of minor cons, and a lot of pros. The following are from my personal experience with this simulator (updated after 24 hours of gameplay):Pros:- Feels quite realistic in terms of how it flies (not 100% spot on, but close enough)- Great for gaining muscle memory and practicing manovers- Lots of tracks, and can be expanded by steam workshop (improvement: entire maps from workshop + a map editor or SDK to allow conversion of any maps (from other games for example))- Controller setup was easy (as long as you have only 1 controller attached. Improvement: instead of 'Controller 1', 'Controller 2' etc, have names, such as 'Xbox controller player 1', 'vJoy Device 1' etc. Also, make it usable when there's more than 4 controllers attached)- In-game HUD almost corresponds to what I see in my FPV headset- The game looks great (improvement: could be more realistic (hay balls don't reflect nearly as much light, the entire environment is static etc))- Decent training scenarios (improvement: allow using any drone in training, not only the sluggish one)- Can build your own tracksCons:- Music volume is inconsistent (the default 70% is obnoxiously loud compared to all other sounds at 100%)- A lot of the settings cannot be changed in the pause menu (audio settings for one, in the menus, it's very hard to set the correct level, as it's not the loudness it's at in-game)- Slider controls are inaccurate (for example camera tilt angle is a slider, which makes it nearly impossible to use a percise value, please allow manual input. My real quad has a tiny servo for camera angle, and allows for very percise settings)- Even at fantastic graphics setting, objects tend to pop in and out of view (disturbing specially on the Hannover map, where flying in the park, benches, poles etc just pop into view)- [minor complaint] When you crash the drone, and break a propeller (so it goes gray), it often times does not reset automatically, even though the drone is practically unflyable. Need to reach the keyboard to reset (suggestion: configuration to edit crash behavior).- [my biggest complaint so far] There is no exclusive fullscreen. In order to play with DSR from 5K to 1440p (to get rid of aliasing effect for good), I need to set my whole desktop resolution to that. Also, exclusive fullscreen would make this game more resilient to lagspikes (for example when windows telemetry runner starts, I get a lagspike). At least have the option (it doesn't have to be default, and should be fairly easy to implement with unity engine)- All maps are quite small. Can't do much roaming even in free flight- No wind simulation (this should be optional)- When I have more than 4 controllers attached, there are times it's impossible to set the right one. Also, sometimes it seems to not pick the correct controller that I used last time upon launching the game (defaults to my mouse (which has a built-in controller with 1 axis) or one of the xbox controllers).- Ground is very slippery and strange - without applying throttle, you can turn the drone in any way you want before taking off, even at a 75 degree angle, and take off- Some checkpoints have awkward hit detection - gates work great, but floating checkpoints can be a real hassle to hit (either detecting too large range horizontally, or not enough range vertically)- Camera noise is a nice feature, but unfortunately it's too unrealistic for me to use (it seems to have shadows for HUD, which is something I've never seen on my FPV setup. More configuration would help)- No replays. Your only hope is to use a screen recorder, but that's not very flexible"

Several users have expressed issues with Transmitters not calibrating correctly or at all with the software.  If you have an RC Transmitter, there are a few guides already posted and several discussions with topics discussing how we've worked through some of those matters - but there are ultimately a LOT of cables and variances in how they're produces, and even more Transmitters that users have. If you're  having errors connected, post it and let's get you flying!  I personally have a Spektrum DX6, DX6i, Taranis Plus, and Turnigy 9x and all work well using a USB cable. The Spektrum devices took several calibration attempts, and then additional Sub-Trim manipulation, but work well after.* * * * * * * *All around - I am really excited to see how they progress with this game. The 3 current levels are already beautiful and the multiplayer is going to be very exciting. Two thumbs up! (Then back to the joysticks!)Note: While this game does work decently with 360 or similar gaming controller, I do not recommend spending time to get used to it. Gaming joysticks are meant to center themselves when you release pressure. This is ideal for most game situations, but not with throttle. While I did use the 360 controller for the tutorial and first test level, and it was decent enough, once got my Spektrum transmitter connected to the game and calibrated - it was a night and day difference. Much easier flight, it was much more fun and it was much smoother feedback from the camera also as you won't be bobbing up and down.This will be a must have for pilots that want the FPV experience without ruining their setups or going through tons of props in the early learning stages. Would also be great for teaching purposes.I have Real Flight, Phoenix RC and FMS Flight Sim that I have been using all three for quite some time. For a game delving into the FPV realm digitally - my first impression after 45 minutes of play: This is going to be amazing!!"

Not only for the flight experience to gain, but the developers that stand behind their work. Two updates ago, I had problems where I couldn't even fly on here. I contacted Lupus Studios and in less than 24 hours they had me back in the digital skies! And to put the cherry on top, pilot Jack FPV of FPV Academy on YouTube releases tracks and courses on liftoff based on his instruction and drills he's created so other pilots can practice freely without risking wrecking their quad, or offers pilots an opportunity to fly drills inside their house while the weather is uncooperative. Love this one so much, my first quad is an Immersion RC Vortex 285 just like the one on here! Looking to get into the scene? Here's where you start!"

At first I had no clue on how to control the drone and the tutorial is a mess, however, I've managed to fly forward and backwards. Soon after, I learned how to strafe, to rotate and to land. With this basic knowledge I gained in 15 minutes, I was able to dramatically increase my knowledge in a few hours.Now I informed myself about FPV and thinking about getting into it in real life. I'm wondering if playing this game is helping me later on, but so far it didn't hurt I guess. And I bought this for the fun at first, and this minimum I got from the very first hour."

The copter is way too floaty. It feels like gravity has been dialed down to 80% or something. Even with the props idle, the copter takes way too long to fall to earth. Doing sharp turns around flags, the copter slides as if it was weightless.The collision model encourages bad habits. You can't just fly through a tree canopy in real life and keep going. Props do not take damage and then ""heal up"". They either break, and you crash, or they don't break.This is an okay video game, but it is a bad simulator. I can't recommend this game at this time (0.2.2) for learning to fly. It will not teach you what it actually feels like to pilot a quadcopter."

Amazing job, I'm veeeeery happy with it.FWIW, I'm flying with a RadioLink AT9, using the PengFei USB dongle set on AeroFly, I used manual preset creation to configure it, not a single issue.

Quick note: the game doesn't take negative inputs from the taranis, so make a new model, modify the curves to only be 50, and offset by 50. This means your left roll, for example, is really at what is normally the centerpoint (0) and your right roll is what is normally full right (100). You'll have to do this for all channels. In the guides section there's pre-made model files."

Great job you've done there guys!!!At first I wasn't able to map controls to my DX6i, what turned out to be my own fault in the end. But I was really impressed how well you could actually fly this thing with such a piece of crap of a controller like my totally worn out 5 years old 360 gamepad. This was already so much fun that I flew quite a while without worrying about setting up my DX6i properly.When I finally tried with a real rc transmitter I was blown away how great this sim handles and how much fun it is. Compared to yesterday it's a completely different experience!I was happy to see that it's possible now to turn off the OSD but couldn't find an option for changing the camera angle. But I#m confident this will be implemented soon.The flight model feels good and kind of natural, but still is too easy compared to the real thing. I was able to pull off some maneuvers that would have had me crashed in real life. The quad also is not as ""snappy"" as I like it and PID tuning feels still a bit weird but again... I'm confident this will be fixed in the future.So all in all this is a must have for anyone interested or already involved in FPV Racing!!!Old Review from yesterday:At this point I cannot recommend this game for people who fly real fpv racequads...Looks like a good start to me, but a few things annoy the hell out of me and will make me stick with hotprops for now:- the hover point is way below stick center and cannot be adjusted. (Tested this on my old DX4e, my DX6i and my 360 Gamepad - Hover point is at around 25% throttle) I prefer a hover point at the stick center and afaik that's how most people fly- feels like zero throttle in fact isn't zero throttle... quad falls way too slow compared to real life experience- camera angle cannot be adjusted- no way to turn off the OSD ... I prefer flying without OSDThese are all things I'm sure will be fixed soon and besides those the flight model feels promising but needs more fine tuning and more real life feeling (for example jittering when decending into own propwash). There are quite a few sims out there that come near the feeling of piloting a fpv racequad and I really hope this one will come close or even spot on.Time will tell(this review will be updated once liftoff gets better)"
,Recommended,410340,20898064,"Posted: 1 February, 2016",all,Boof69,"I cut my teeth on a very popular RC flight sim and it taught me so much about flying airplanes and helis. Liftoff has already surpassed the other sim for quadcopter physics. Even though it is in early access and is very short of it's eventual goal it is a strong tool for honing quad skills. I have 50 + hours in this sim and being winter where I am I feel my learning is progressing very rapidly. I feel like my second summer flying quads will be very fulfilling having a better sense of control thanks to this sim. The developers are very interested in user input and come through with regular updates. I am very excited for the future of this sim. Highly recommend for anyone interested in multirotor flight!Update!I just crossed the 300 hour mark with Liftoff. I started flying quads mid summer 2015 and only flew in level mode. Even though I used that mode I still had crashes. I spent some of the winter flying Liftoff in acro mode and improved to a great degree in that time. I have had quite a few flights this summer and only fly acro (Take off, flight, and Landing), and I now fly as if I have been flying for much longer than 1 and a half seasons. I have made many Liftoff videos to demonstrate it's power as a learning tool.I can attest, after spending so much time in the sim, that anyone having a problem with this simulator is falling victim to either their own ignorance or outdated hardware. To speak to the later I feel that hardware non-upgraders are the bain of all gamers. If you are on an old laptop or a weak one for that matter you should naturally expect to have issues with games not working correctly. Upgrade or die! Seriously if you are one of these people realize you are holding us all beack. Please stop crying about games not working on your decrepit outdated machines. To the former; Why review a game poorly before you exhaust all efforts to learn the customizations? Sims always throw arcaders off. Just because you can't fly easily right off the bat doesn't mean it's broken. It means you currently lack the skill required to keep it in the air. This is remedied one of two ways. 1. Spend time learning to tune the aircraft by a. watching videos from people that have put in the work to help people such as yourself. b. experimenting a while reserving judgment until you figure things out. 2. Un-install the sim and go find something arcadish and easier made for people just like you.Also why is it that some people forget the simple fact that this is an EARLY RELEASE title? Common sense dictates that it won't be perfect and that it is still under development. Updates for this and all other early access titles can sometimes have negitive affects. Be prepared for that. New resources for liftoff are added at a more than acceptable rate IMO. Further more the developers respond to questions in quick fasion. This sim/game is living up to it's potential in all areas, improving all the time.To any prospective buyer please note that you will need some sort of a game controller to fly Liftoff. A keyboard will not work. Seems obvious but...To get the best experience a interlink radio that comes with realflight or a game commander that comes with aerofly can be used and the buttons and switches can be used to switch modes or reset the aircraft. The gimbals aren't the best but this will provide the most in-game support of functions. The Sim supports field radios (remote controllers for real world aircraft) The easiest and best of these is the Taranis X9D/plus. This radio has a mini usb port on the back that makes it a perfect option for this and other sims like it. Liftoff has a preset for this controller as well. Even though it is perfect for the sim you will need to program the radio to work correctly. There is a guide for this and many other radios. That said not all radios play nice and there is nothing the developer can really do about that.I own all the other quad racing sims out there and this hands down is the best and the other sims are complete products not under development. If you are thinking about buying Liftoff and especially if you want to use it to improve your real world flying I say buy it. You will not be disappointed as long as you are not under any misconceptions and are willing to spend time with it."

It's AGGRAVATING! Come on, do I really have to fight with getting my transmitter controller to work with the game EVERY single time I boot it up? Really? Why can't it just save my transmitter and its settings? Seriously... this is just pathetic.The devs really need to fix this issue, otherwise pilots are bound to run into the same issue and get just as frustrated, leaving this otherwise awesome sim for one that actually works with their transmitters.Note: I'm using a FlySky FS-i5s transmitter.----Pros:* Realistic flight physics* Good graphics* Simulated FPV static* Track editor for making custom tracks* Has a few official race tracks already in the game* Customizable drones and flight settings.* Awesome downloadable content provided from the Steam Workshop communityCons:* BAD TRANSMITTER DETECTION. Having to re-do your transmitter settings every time you boot up the game is just asinine.* VERY HIGH difficulty and learning curve (this game is not for everyone)* Physics can sometimes go bonkers (the game is still in development, so I can't blame the creators)* Not a lot of tracks/areas (yet)* Has a small selection of drones (this most likely will grow larger as the game develops)* An actual flight transmitter/controller is definitely required (video game pads don't quite cut it)* Flight transmitters are pretty expensive (as well as the hobby itself).

There are race tracks set up that you can blast through in Self level or Acro mode (toggled by pressing the A key).  There isnt much choice in the way of Quads to choose from, but in FPV mode it makes almost no difference what frame you use.  The motor, prop, battery selection in the workbench is very good. Lobster motors, quiet clever.I love God mode, changing props, batteries etc is for Actual reality, dispencing that chore triples your play time.The physics are right on the money for my experience.  I have always used self level mode (comming from a Photography/Phantom background)  and I would almost never used full throttle but spending 10 hours on this in Acro mode and full throttle upto 60% of the time..... and I dont think I will go back to self level on mini quads, except maybe in the carpark level, thats pretty enclosed for me at the moment.I have my graphics set to HD and on Good (on a laptop).

But as we all know the fast toys aren't neccessrily the cheapest.So I figured I had better get my feet wet with some sim time before even attempting the real thing. Smart choice for me! lolDidn't care to get some sim that was gonna try and cover ever form of flying - you know planes and all. Just some dedicated  sim for the quads kind. One where all efforts were single focused. Not one half-a__ed in all fields - but a killer in one.I like Steam and after some surfing around and see all the other sims and the half-hearted reviews. One kept poking it's head out by some few as to how great liftoff is.Went to Steam and bought. Been giggling ever since! Did some 360 controller hook-up and got my feet wet. I could see the tremendous effort hiding behind an inappropriate controller. A simulator just dying to be set free! The 360 controller is great for a lot of games. But one thing that become obvious really guick was the fact that it isn't configured right for real world flight. When you go thru the calibrating stage to run a controller that isn't a preloaded configuration, I found a major flaw with these controllers.The little joy sticks don't travel in a ""square box"" perimeter pattern when you have to rotate them thru there full throw calibration. What I mean is that in a real flying situation and you have full left yaw and you want to keep that input and then throw full throttle at the same time (mode two throttle with yaw on the same left stick) when you push the little stick up for the full throttle it will end up moving to the right ( back to the middle) on the yaw axis to get to full throttle! That sucks! Not a ""real world"" condition. So the controller takes away a whole lot of these people's hard work when they created this really great simulator and the new pilot learns how to fly with some really crumby technique!Now I want to get something like a Taranis grade transmitter. But i couldn't see spending a couple hundred on a transmitter that might get outdated by a new model by the time I learned to fly! Shopped around and took a gamble on a ""USB RC Flight Simulator RC Tech 6chn"" controller. UPS just delivered it today. So I plugged in and went caibrating with liftoff. Sure 'nuf the ""square"" pattern of sticks on the controller is what brought Liftoff to life! Let me tell you - talk about making you feel like what the real quad must feel like! If not it has to be so close that what ever difference there must be will be but an extremely small little hickup to learn in the actual flying.Now I am pretty sure I don't have reverse throttle - but that can be fingered out at a latter date with maybe the help  of some serious tech guy. But this little cheap controller and this great Liftoff Simulator you can be come, I'm sure, a very competant pilot. Be able to strap on a real one and fly the first time out without digging a million postholes or chopping concrete up with an expensive quad. And probably at real close to racing speeds and manuveralbility.So people go get the real controller and this Liftoff! Highly, highly recommended quad simulator - this thing rocks!!!!C ya @ the races!"
,Recommended,410340,29239095,Posted: 13 January,all,fallofshadows,"Before I ever got a real quad, I bought a Taranis to practice in simulators. This was easily the best decision I made. I initially started with this simulator, but it was too laggy to be any good, so I spent a solid 30 hours on Hotprops. Now that I have 6 months of real life FPV under my belt, I've found myself coming back to this sim.First of all, the physics are great. Being able to tweak so much in the flight controller settings has allowed me to set up my virtual quad pretty darn close to my Xhover Element. The only big problem I've noticed is that the sim can feel a bit too floaty, like any bit of throttle you give will keep you in the air much better than in the real world. Adjusting the throttle curve fixes this.The graphics aren't terrible, and I feel like the sim has gotten much smoother over time. I'm running it on my iMac and find that 720p graphics work the best. I also like the ability to play with FPV noise. It's not exactly like experiencing real breakup in your video feed, but it does the job pretty well. My biggest grip with the graphics is the way the trees appear. If you're flying fast at all, you'll find that they sort of just materialize right in front of you, making it hard to avoid wrecking on branches or shredding your props on leaves.With the more recent updates, you now have a whole bunch of frames to choose from. I'm really excited about this, although I can't say I feel a huge difference in the way the frames fly. As long as your motors, battery, and props are the same, the frames fly pretty much exactly alike, with the obvious exception of the much smaller frames that can only run 4"" or smaller props.So, what would I change? First of all, the crash physics are pretty bad. This isn't a huge deal, but there's something amusing about crashes with real life quads. One minute you're flying along fine, the next you're tumbling and bouncing across the ground. In the sim, you sort of hit the ground and slide, which isn't realistic at all.Next up, I would love to see some 5x4x3 props. The ""Propfan"" 5030x3 do a decent job of simulating the HQ 5x4x3's that I fly in real life, but they're definitely not the same. A proper 5"" tri blade with a little more bite in the air would be awesome.Next up, some larger areas to fly in would be fun. I'm not much of a racer, instead I do primarily freestyle flying. Levels like the Hangar are so much fun because of the vertical structures, so I would like to see more stuff like that. Maybe even a more urban environment like an abandoned factory or office park?The biggest thing I would change is the FPV camera lens option. First, I would move it to the workbench screen instead of in the settings screen. Next, I would add a 2.5mm option. I, like a lot of people, fly in real life with a GoPro lens on my HS1177 camera, which provides a superior field of view without the annoying fisheye effect that a 2.1mm lens has.All that being said, I highly recommend this simulator. It's a great way to knock the rust off if you haven't flown in a while, or to teach somebody new to fly. Despite its flaws, Liftoff is my favorite simulator and I find myself coming back to it time and time again."

76561198113317431,Recommended,410340,30170832,Posted: 25 February,all,graham69parkinson,"Being fairly new to RC Drones I decided to get a few different simulators like this one, both FPV Freerider sims, Velocidrone, FPV Event and the free DRL Simulator. From the testing I've done there seems to be a large void between how each one feels and how close to the real thing they get, for example Liftoff seems to be more like an arcade game with the feeling I get from the controls, where it seems to have way to much punch the second you move the throttle stick. So just getting used to it isn't easy even when you fly in level/stability mode, it does get better in acro but the same issue with the punch power is still there. Like I've said I have several of these sims and the two I have found closest to real life are FPV Event and Velocidrone and it's because they both seem to be setup with real world physics. I fly a Robocat 270 racing drone and it has plenty of power and is capable of around 60/70 mph, and it feels nothing like the drones in Liftoff because they just shoot upwards like their on steroids.  And when it comes to the workbench screen I find the lack of contrast ridiculas because its hard to see whats on the screen unless im sat inches away from it, so I think the developers could take a look at changing the Font size and background colour to make it easier for people to be able to read the information either in the workbench parts description or the flight controller settings screen. Apaert from that I do think Liftoff has loads of scope to be improved and it will only take some tiny tweaks to get it close to a full on drone simulator, and at it's price point I do think it could be a whole lot better.  But if like me you are finding it hard to get your head around I would recommend trying some of the free ones like DRL simulator or the free trial of FPV Event, as like me you will notice just what I have, Liftoff is a great simulator but it's not quite real enough."

So after a bit of research I discovered this simulator and bought it to help me get used to the controls while I begin buying/putting-together my first quad.As of 03/05/16:(using Xbox 360 controller)Summary:I'm really enjoying this early-access simulator. It seems to be very well put together and is a realistic (within reason) FPV simulator.The physics seem to be near spot-on compared to footage I've seen of FPV'ers, though I have to agree with some of the reviewers here, they do seem slightly floaty. The collision and prop damage models are good, but I found myself wishing for a less forgiving collision model when it came to tree branches. Perhaps there might be a 'difficulty setting' regarding the damage model in future?The visuals are fantastic for a performance-oriented simulator. The models are well-made, and the film grain and distortion prove to be highly immersive and make me feel like I'm actually controlling (and crashing) the quad.Sound design is passable, as is par in most realistic simulators in my experience. It would be nice to hear some improvements here but definitely not neccessary.The UI is well laid out, though not free of small issues. I suspect they will be remedied swiftly and easily.Conclusion:I'm looking forward to multiplayer and any of the other features/improvements to come.

They’ve done such a good job on this game. The tutorial sucked though, it’s a really bad way to start someone off who’s never handled a drone before. It’s difficult for someone who hasn’t had any experience. The tutorial level is really confusing and hard to tell where stuff is because the whole of the map is the same colour with no definition or shadows. I was playing the tutorial for ages not getting anywhere with my skill. But then I played the actual maps. The forest is the best map because it’s fun and easy! After playing on the forest map for a short time I really got the hang of the controls and synched all the other maps including the carpark witch is apparently the hardest. The graphics are stunning when camera sound is off, terrific use of shadows. Overall the game takes a bit to get use to but if you keep persisting by playing the tutorial for an hour or two then move onto the forest map you’ll be pro in no time! And this simulater is actualy helping me upskill with my IRL fpv drone."

You have to press Esc on the keyboard and use the mouse every time you want to change music track, instead of just using a button on the controller.The menu is pretty bad. There's only an option to ""save and exit"" no option for ""discard changes and exit"". This would be usefull when changing controls since you can't undo a keybind, only replace it by another keybind. If you mark a keybind and you don't press any keys, it will go back to ""None"" after a couple of seconds, but that is NOT very intuitive!The tutorial does not work.With two monitors the game starts on 2nd monitor. I have to press Windows+Shift+Right arrow to put the game on main monitor every time I start the game.The game has controller presets for Xbox One controller, which I use even though I have Xbox 360 for Windows controller. Because if I make a custom calibration etc. the game will not recognize the controller in the menu. Even though I use the Xbox One preset that works the best, I still can't go back in the menu, only up, down, left, right and further. I have to use keyboard or mouse if I want to go back in the manu.After a couple of hours of tweaking I like the game more, but I'm sure people buying this game just to play a videogame may not find the fun immediately.I like it because I want to fly racing quadcopters, but in the start it's not very userfriendly and guideable, so it took many hours before I figured out to make proper tweaks to the controls etc."

Throttle is insanely twitchy even with a ton of expo. If you want/need to fly close to the ground absolutely good luck as it's virtually impossible to keep even the most basic quad more than 10-20' off the deck.IT decides when you have flown too high or too far and warns you to turn back, yet even if you do so immediately it's fade to black, reset the game.Good idea, but extremely poor execution.

Little did i realize that this is a FPV drone sim only.  It does not offer the ability to fly a drone from 3rd person or from the view of the pilot.. You are locked into a FPV camera.  But that's not why i don't recommend it.. I do not recommend this sim because of the controls..The quads auto throttle in this game.  I dont want it to auto throttle.. I want to control the throttle.   Once arming the drone for flight, your drone will automaticlly go up in the air and will continue to acend until you press down on your controller.  This is not how it should be.  The drone should not go up, unless i hit throttle up.. and when my sticks go to their center position, it should hover.I tried several presets, and both ATTI, and Level modes.  There is a built in preset for the Xbox One Controller for windows, but it auth throttles.I made my own preset, and specifically set throttle up/down, and it still auto throttled.Refunded this POS. They need to fix the throttle controls, and at least put a pilot view without FPV in there.  They also need to tell people that this is FPV only."

This is impossibly hard for quite a long time and the tutorial doesn’t help. This game is clearly made by drone pilots, for drone pilots.The games starts with the controls screen and you have to input what you want to use for what straight away. Not the most intuitive menus either. It then throws you into the main menu. Not as bad as the controls menu, makes sense. I thought the game might be hard so I started with the tutorial.Sweet lord christ. Stupid tutorial. One of the worst I’ve ever played. Doesn’t tell you how to do anything, just what it wants you to achieve. Completely pointless.After that, I tried to fight for what felt like most of my life before I could get the drone to kinda go in the direction I wanted it to go. I thought this would probably be good enough for the first race as it would probably be really easy. I was very wrong. The first race is astonishingly hard. And you have to do 3 laps without crashing. When I finally finished the course three times in a row (After enabling god mode in the gameplay options.) I was met with my three times and a total time. That’s all. I have no idea how well I did in that race. Probably really badly but that’s not the point. I then attempted an underground parking lot level that was ridiculous, quite honestly.Regardless of all this, I’m going to recommend it because me sucking at the game does not mean it’s a bad game. However, this could be 100000000x better if the respawn times were WAY faster. Super-meat-boy fast. Really really fast.So, overall, the music got on my♥♥♥♥♥♥ the controls got on my♥♥♥♥♥♥ the insane difficulty got on my♥♥♥♥♥♥but it’s still a good game already.

This gives a realistic flight situation. But then, it is impossible to do any changes. I always must switch back to my office monitor change the resolution to the changes and then change everything back. This need some fixing.There is a beginners training mode, but the colors are so terrible. Light blue walls and white bottom. This is so crazy. There is no contrast in the colors. I never used this, cause it is nothing for beginners :-)I think this a alpha problems which can be fixed.Facit: If it goes to the final stage this app will be the the best training app you can get for race training.

A warning for anyone who isn't an experienced drone pilot though - this is not going to be an easy game to just pick up and play.  It's a pretty realistic sim, and they've made the ""race"" modes realistic as well, meaning the gates are all tiny, and low to the ground.  For an inexperienced pilot, expect to practice for several hours or more before you successfully complete any of the races.I really think they should add some beginner race tracks, with big, forgiving gates.Also, there's some bugginess with the prop damage, and the auto-reset doesn't always work (sitting there with no props left, and have to manually restart).  Not sure why they wanted to do prop damage the way they did.  You can accidentally just bounce a little on the ground when you go to lift off, and it'll damage your props.  Not very realistic at all.So yeah, there's a lot they could do to improve it, but if you're looking for a decent FPV sim for training purposes, this is it.

But. It's for racing / Freestyle drone, it's hard. In real life it can hurt, or cost money and time to crash so that's why we love a true simulator ;)Liftoff is very good at what it tries to do, mimic the real world mechanics of immersion RC drones (it is sponsored guys, only immersion RC stuff here. They may add other options / Chassis in the future but right now there is only that)Why you may want something else? You may ask. Well, I've build many quads since I started this hobby 18 months ago and they're all very, very, light now (250g at most without battery) and I don't know how much Immersion RC Drones weight when well equipped but they feel very heavy here (maybe 400g is my guess) But that's no real issue, it just flies a bit differently, it's less nimble, more inertia to fight against. (It might come from the game engine thought)Something else : no 2.5mm lens it's a nice sweet spot between the Fishy mc fish eye 2.1 and the not that fishy 2.8mm lenses... just sayin'The collision engine is a bit weird.

I have been playing with a full compatible USB controller and it works amazingly well, and gives a near realistic feel of flight. The game however is very weighted towards racing pilots and not freestyle pilots, and here I'm referring to lack of objects on the maps and the limited size of maps as well for freestyling. I would love the see the option to create own maps so we can design freestyle maps ourselves, but seeing as it's in early access there's a lot more to come and hopefully more suitable options for freestyle pilots. :-)"

It's raining outside, you're sick, you've been drinking, or you need to rebuild your favorite quad? No worries, fire up Liftoff, have a seat, and get ready to rip. Most pilots will tell you that you need to keep flying to keep your skills up, or you'll go rusty, and have to relearn everything all over again. It's about muscle memmory, timing, and familiarity. Liftoff helps out when you don't have any packs left to rip, or the weather isn't cooperating. Customize your quad as close as you can to the one yu fly with the workbench, tune it up in the ingame BetaFlight simulator, and set your FPV angle. Yhe FPV will also simulate the video noise you get from your headset from flying near large metal structures, behind trees, and distance (to a degree, you'll never lose Video like in real life).  Want to race it up with the community? Get out there and try the prebuilt tracks, or get on the Steam workshop and try out maps that others out there made. Loads of fun without the cost of crashed quads, busted props, and puffed packs.  Grab it and you'll be pleased. I have FrSky Taranis and Turnigy Evolution, and I have to say, the Evolution just worked as soon as I plugged her in, whereas the Taranis required me to make a model. Either way, easy set up and get to ripping.  Only downfall is the music tracks get really repetative, so fire up your own music. God mode in races isn't infalible but it really gives an edge to the guys that play with it always on, and will make you wonder how they slam the shipping container and still keep flying. This is solved by disabling god mode in any race you create, but don't expect the races you join to have it disabled. Well worth my hard earned money, since it makes me a better pilot without the cost of repair."

The fact that you have the ability to build a virtual drone with all the flight characteristics of your actual drone is a huge advantage in learning as how you fly in the simulator can almost directly transfer to real world flight.

It was impossible for me to set it correctly, and some options like the calibration settings, appears randomly, when it does, its impossible to calibrate specific settings, like pitch, without going completing other steps first. It requieres way too much effort to make the control settings this bad, but they did it.https://youtu.be/E-6bIEDkuFwAs a positive, this looks WAY BETTER than DRL High Voltage, there is a lot of more work on this, buy at least I can play on DRL High Voltage, this, so far, I can't.::UPDATE::I manged to get it to ""work"" by creating my own control profile, YET, I have no idea WHY, but each time i rotate to left and right, it changes the POV, and I can't believe there is not any option to invert the axis, since the control setup is so mess up, it detected my input in the wrong direction, so I had to invert it using a 3th party plugin... CMON!I mean, its clear I want to play this, it looks great, but how its posible to mess up the controls so bad? and im not using any weird control, its the standard xbox 360 controller.And I know, its early release, but how are we suposed to test this if we can't even control it?https://youtu.be/18gTUZTHA4kI have yet to try ti with the ""experimental branch input system"", but so far, with the vainilla setting, its terrible.::UPDATE::I have been using the ""Experimental Branch"" and yes, that ""fixed"" the whole control problem, actually, that experimental branch is quite amazing."

,Recommended,410340,35496634,Posted: 5 October,all,sven út Fryslân,"One of the most realistic quad race sims. (in comparison to Freerider and Velocidrone) It even simulates signal distortion of the VTX. But most important the handling of the quads are very realistic!Gorgeous levels: Urban and nature landscapes. Nice trees, like to S-turn and powerloop the trees in Hannover. Very nice forrest track Pinevalley, intense track to fly on. Quite some different quads you can fly with: 130mm to 6 inch quads. (missing the (dutch) epiquad though)There's also purist race mode (which i prefer the most) where the battery voltage and propdamage play quite a role on the race experience. User interface looks nice but not alway logic and music is fine but after a while a little boring.Didn't got to the trackbuilder yet but there's enough content in the workshop to practise flying with.Tip for the developers: More attention on the leaderboards! Perhaps it is possible to set record times in multiplayer mode when you are flying alone in a race."
