,Not Recommended,410430,29550185,Posted: 28 January,all,Faudraline,"Morphineis the first and only game made by Kerem Kumbasar - a name that we see in nearly every available space of this game - a Turkish indie developer. For a one man project and a first trial at unity to produce something presentable, I'd say that it is a semi-success. The game has some imaginative value and is brave enough to take the risk of undergoing a psychedelic horror display, but it has its unforgivable parts which led me into casting a downvote.To arrange a non-spoiler summary, our character is a high school student with some background and popularity issues. He is the subject of constant bullying for his whole high school experience, because why not? He is insecure and intolerant, with an impending psychosis on the side. The game invites us to go through a psychedelic journey in his memories, eventually bringing us to the point where he decides to get violent. It should be noted that the name of our protagonist is a bit ambiguous, since the names of our protagonist and antagonist got mixed-up half-way through the game. For the most part, he is referred as Peter - the bully being Ted, yet nearing the end game, our silent nerd is called as Ted and the bully is called as Peter. It is quite frustrating. It might be declared that they were the same and the one person altogether, but that really doesn't fit into the story, so... if anyone managed to get that part, inform me.This next paragraph may contain some spoilers, so feel free to skip. To declare the cold, harsh truth: this is not really a horror game. As a character, our protagonist doesn't carry that much depth. The sentence ""I'm not a loser"" pops up everywhere to the degree of desensitizing you to his case. Sure he is deeply hurt and deeply disturbed to the point of hallucinating about on-going affairs. He especially keeps hallucinating about a body-builder anthropomorphic rabbit, which dreadfully resembles Frank from the movieDonnie Darko. It's only pink and seems to be especially sadistic rather than existentialistic. He constantly teases and mocks the character in some disturbing, yet mostly comical scenes. The substance that gives the name to the title is more or less irrelevant to the whole context. At some point, our character injects himself with morphine, then goes wild enough to pull a school shooting. Now, that is plain misinformation. Morphine is an opiate. It is injected to deal with pain and it is highly addictive. It most certainly doesn't induce hallucinations, neither elevates aggression. On the contrary, it simply makes you high, and mostly docile.Environment display is quite alright, and effects are okay, if not a bit overused. Jump scares mostly don't serve their purpose, yet they invoke a smile of ridicule on your face. That friggin' bunny is everywhere, and you'll get bored of him 10 minutes into the game. Character models seem somewhat decent, but nothing extraordinary. Remember that this is a unity game, and unity has always its limits.Gameplay, even though somewhat basic and boring, works alright. No bugs, no system crashes etc. It mostly consists of WASD movement, some item picking and some mini-games. Considering that you cannot actually die, or lose the game, there is no real threat to the character either. So I'd hardly classify this game as a horror. Mini-games consist of some lock picking - similar to Skyrim lock picking -, some very rare QTEs and some dreadfully basic shooting. Other than that, you walk around, led by some eerie green glitter and keep reading journals with really, really poor English. Now I've seen some games with really bad translation, but here, it comes to the degree of actually crippling the plot. If only the developer would take a moment to make someone proofread the translation, we'd actually have a consistent plot here.I most surely cannot recommend this game as it is, but if you are to acquire it in a bundle or a decent sale, you may still get some enjoyment out of it. It is really heartbreaking to see the potential getting crippled with huge display errors here. I wish the best for the lone cowboy developer and also wish him success for his next project.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"
,Not Recommended,410430,18784557,"Posted: 30 October, 2015",all,VI -nsanity,"Not entirely certain what to think here :/ I thought this was going to basically be a horror game played from the viewpoint of a school bully's victim and exploring the pschological suffering and terror that go along with it. Blah blah - fancy words, fancy expectations.What I got was a bizarre mixture of overly loud scream effects, guiding faerie lights, and the Donnie Darko rabbit with a serious case of steroid abuse. I honestly feel that this could have actually been an awesome game with a bit of polishing. But sadly, the only thing this game is, is a hodgepodge attempt at artsyness wrapped in chaotic failure. Cheesey, badly executed and predictable horror effects have been sprinkled to and fro and inbetween the cookie cutter characters: your default ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bully, your default girl of your dreams, your default creepy creature, your default terrors, your default troubled nerd glasses kid... the list goes on. Oh, and just because: needless lockpick and door opening minigames. IMHO a game can be ""wierd and artsy"" but if it relies solely on that, the results end up being stale and somewhat cheap, as the story felt extremely flimsy and predictable here.And I feel bad saying all of this, because the idea and the concept of the game are quite neat. One other thing that really really bothered me was the atrocious english translation. One or two little mistakes can easily be ignored, but the game is saturared with bad expressions, faulty grammar, and flimsy translations. English is a difficult language to master - even more so when you're not a native speaker. But there are so, so, SO many people right here on Steam who would have been delighted to proof read it as well as help out with the grammar, spelling and what have you.Blaaaaaaaargh. Not my cup of tea, for sure. I tried to like it and give it a chance. But I wish the dev good luck in the future!"

,Not Recommended,410430,32160495,Posted: 3 June,all,CorvusCorax,"Morphine puts us in the shoes of an 18-year-old high school student who experiences a lot of bullying in his class. I think the idea of putting school bullying in the focus is commendable as not many video game use it for storytelling purposes. It should also be noted that it was mainly developed by Kerim Kumbasar - upon completion you can read his notes saying the game is based on his own experience.Now, Morphine is, first and foremost, one of those first person exploration games. It is not an FPS in its true sense as shooting enemies is kept to a minimum. It is more about walking, interacting with objects and minimalistic puzzle solving. We relive the many times Peter was bullied by his classmate, Ted and these are often followed by dream-like sequences with a giant rabbit that is akin to the one in the film Donnie Darko. The main jumpscares are attributed to the appearance of this otherworldly creature.My problem with Morphine was how it is executed. Not all the actions you do make sense and I felt it was unoptimised. I experienced severe FPS drops in an area where I could turn on the TV. Notes in the game help us understand what we experience - Peter describes in detail what Ted did to him. The problem here is the command of English employed which is just terrible. The game's synopsis on the store page is also full of spelling errors. I do not understand why no spellchecking was done right after the development activities were finalised. There's even a name change we experience towards the ending - it is unclear who you punish as throughout the game that particular person had a completely different name.Considering the high degree of oversight the game has I am inclined to downvote it. I am happy to have played a game with an interesting idea (finally something that doesn't just use Unity assets but actually employs a story), however, I cannot forgive the mistakes that could have easily been eliminated with a little more attention to detail. The version number remains 1.0 in the game menu which means the developer probably abandoned his project following the Steam release.Perhaps the idea here was to test his programming skills; Kerim, for me, looks like an ambitious developer but this game still requires several updates to come to fruition. The many positives reviews do not help, either, as they often lack detailing the game experience or have similar punctuation / grammatical errors that prove they either received a free key or they are just friends of Kerim."
,Not Recommended,410430,32837941,Posted: 26 June,all,Bonnie Elizabeth Parker,"So I played this game through and decided to judge after having completed the game's storyline.I understand the story and what the creator is trying to show us, but the execution is very poorly done. Which is unfortunate.  The grammar was painful to deal with while it's something that CAN be overlooked it plays a huge part in how your game is recieved by players.It feels like the creator did not double check a lot of things, stuff became confusing for example the name changes between the main char and the other char it's about. (I don't want to spoil things for people who intend on playing this game). It's very confusing at least.Some of the interactions are insanely wonky and early on in the game I feel it's just crated with some cheap jumpscares that to me personally made NO sense at all. It felt to me like they were just there to startle you and were not related to the game itself at all.Onto the 'cinematic' part of this game, unfortunately they are tedious. Dragged out and insanely slowgoing, making me wish I could skip them.  Something is not cinematic if you're staring at the same screen for 5 minutes, just to read some poorly formulated conversation between two people for it then to move on to something else.I gave this game a shot, it's something that was a GREAT idea. If only the execution was a little better then this review would have been a positive one."

The story and writing are both bad fundamentally. The game is plagued by performance issues and other bugs. For example if the game takes contorl away from your mouse, you can't use hte mouse in the menu system etiher! The story tries to be clever, but is nothig but tropes you've seen before, executed poorly. The script wasn't even run through a spell checker. This is a very missable game. I don't recommend it."

The entire experience feeds into the whole ""It's so bad it's good!"". Just imagine if The Room, or Fateful Findings could be a video game. Made by one dude who clearly was trying to express some pent up feelings, we have ended up with this really convoluted story about a boy being bullied. But this game is brilliant, like seriously! It's about bad translated English, it's about a strange attempt at horror, it's about not actually understanding how to real social interactions works. This is a game you buy, invite a friend over and play over a few beers. Please buy this game and support the dev so we can get more games like this!!!

Huge kudos though for the off-mainstream subject and empathy-indulging, semi-psychological storyline."
,Not Recommended,410430,31126283,Posted: 13 April,all,ThrillhouseVHx,"Feels like it's a high school project that made it's way onto Steam.  I'm curious as to how it has such positive reviews, because I couldn't bare to waste another minute of my life on this game. I felt nothing but frustration.I really tried to love it, but couldn't get into it. At all. It's a shame because the idea is great and there was so much room to create something amazing, but it just didn't land.There are so many bugs, the plot hasn't been thought out well (or what I managed to get through hadn't), the jump scares are horrible and the design is riddled with horrible, generic overlays.The English translation was terrible – horrible grammar and loose translations. I can ignore it a few times, but it is so heavily polluted with errors that would've been easily fixed if they'd had a second set of eyes over. I KNOW for a fact that plenty of people would've put their hands up to help out with something like that.Dev, I know you're proud of your work (your name is literally E V E R Y W H E R E... it's hard to miss), and well done on getting the game out there. Let this be a stepping stone to something greater, and PLEEEASE impliment all the suggestions these negative reviews are giving you into your next project."

While it does at times give off a mild Donnie Darko vibe, it's mainly due to the stolen theme of an insae reappearing rabbit. The few jumscares this has aren't worth the horror title and the story outline is pretty basic at best.I am aware this is a one man project and a Turkish game, but the translation wasn't proofread and some of the English wording is cringe-worthy. Playing it in its native language, the writing is a lot better, but the general public cannot be expected to actually know how to read Turkish, so it remains a negative point.The only redeeming feature is the actual topic of the story, yet the presentation is sadly completely unable to make it possible to receive the game seriously.Even at 3$, this is no recommendation due to cringeworthy translation, cringeworthy animations, very basic presentation and a rather short experience of 2 hours maximum for a playthrough.

I appreciate the work of the developer, and I think the subject of the game is important. However there are just too many shortcomings in the game to recommend it, even for an indie game.First, the graphics: Most of the scenes are very dark, and you either look for dark gray objects on a darker gray ground, or try to find your way using a absurdly small cone of light coming from your mobile or a flashlight. And even if there is a little more light, graphic is simple and static.The story: As I said earlier, the subject is important, but why must the story be so shallow-brained? Poor kid is left by his mom, despised by his dad, bullied by his classmates, whatever could happen to a kid, he got it. Locked in the barn, thrown in the water and his mother even bothers to write a letter how much she hates him before she leaves. Oh, come on.The gameplay: It´s simply bland. The game would make a nice walking simulator, as most of the time all you have to do is walk around, find the right (and very often only) hotspot in the room and click it - if it wasn´t so dark! Very often you walk through a dark grey coridor looking for a medium gray object on a darker gray ground. Also, there are these terrible ""minigames"" - like when you tap space again and again and again to break open a door - and these completely useless puzzles:You face a locked door - you find a pickaxe - when you try to break open the door, the pickaxe is stuck in the wood and you cannot pull it out again.Seriously?What makes it worse - some hotspots are activated only after you interacted with another item, so you have to click in the order A-B-C and nothing else.There are no decisions to make, the path is set and all you can do is follow it.So again, as much as I tried to like the game - I completed it and all achievements - in the end the question is: Is it a good game? And the answer sadly is no. No doubt. It´s not. Not at all.Dont waste your money!"

I wish there was audio for the voices though, you have to read a lot...I got this game on sale, so for a cheaper price, grabbing it is a nice deal."

Do not buy this : your loved one will leave you for that guy you always hated in high school, puppies will start dying all over the world, your house will burn leaving nothing but a pile of ashes and hell's gate will open, swallowing you into an eternity of suffering. Seriously."

The visuals are subpar, the story is mediocre at best, the gameplay it jittery, and worst of all the only horror aspect is a collection of jump scares. The camping chapter is annoying and involves to much collecting. The are actually parts in the maps where the scenery doesn't fit together. Not the worst game ever and for price I bought it for I guess I shouldn't complain, but I wish I had my $3.00 back. If you are thinking about buying this game think twice."

,Recommended,410430,33847836,Posted: 27 July,all,J3W 4 U,"If you are a fan of Mr. Kumbasar's work (which to my knowledge is only this game) then you'll be like, ""So f*cking prom!"". That you will also write an intelligent review such as this remarkable one and while on the subject of intelligence. The moving message that Mr. Kumbasar's work invokes may take some time to fully deconstruct and may take years to fully digest. Because this ""story"", I'm putting it in quotation marks because it's much more than a story as expressed in the final lines in which Mr. Kumbasar says, ""Although it is not based on an experienced story, it is a game based on experienced feelings"". Which we all know is the reason why it's more than just a ""story"".-Thanks for the meme Kerim, and keep meme-ing and NEVER stop dreaming."

But not just in parts that are important. Entire buttons are cut off to me. I can't adjust the settings either it seems because those buttons are cut off as well."
,Recommended,410430,18804659,"Posted: 31 October, 2015",all,HellaHezz,"Good story, very appealing to an ex-art student (me) who had to sit through films like Eraserhead for 'coursework' - Nothing is going to kill you or force you to reload a checkpoint, but there are some pretty good jumpscares, creepy ambience and interactive elements. It is really horror of an aquired taste though, so if FNAF or Slenderman scares you, this probably won't be your cup of tea.The only downside I have is with the dialogue (written). While it is easy to get the jist of the narration, a lot of the english is broken and could do with being proofread before being published. Normally it wouldn't bother me, but at certain moments, lack of grammar can ruin it a little."
