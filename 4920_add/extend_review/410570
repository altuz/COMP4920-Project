,Not Recommended,410570,22280049,"Posted: 6 April, 2016",all,Cyrix,"EDIT: The game is no longer ""Vive-exclusive"", but still isn't a good game.This ""Vive-exclusive'"" edition of Gunjack was not designed for the Vive and is not enjoyable as a result. Instead of using the controllers to aim, you aim with your head. The only thing you do with the controllers is press the triggers, which makes the ""Vive-exclusive"" nature of this game a joke, since it would have worked just as well with a mouse or a keyboard or an NES gamepad or anything that had two buttons on it.Aiming with your head is not fun. The turret follows your head movement, so all you do is look at things and press the trigger. What makes this more offensive is that in the opening cinematic for each level, you have free look as your character reaches forward to grasp two control arms that you think are going to be represented by the controllers. The cinematic implies you can aim the turret with your arms while looking around with your head. Nope, the turret is glued to your head and your arms do nothing.Aiming with your head is not fun. I'll be taking a refund on this one, and won't try it again unless they add a proper control setup. This is a shameless cash grab, and charging $10 for a Galaxy Gear game with no actual Vive features is ridiculous."

The aim is guided by head movement, and it simply does not meet my expectations of what VR should be.I will be refunding this game. For $3 it could be nice, but I won't pay a full $10 for this experience."

And now game developers pulled  motion controller support completely with no warning or compensation for those who bought it for the motion controls. Terrible roll out of a new app and terrible developer practices, I wouldn't recommend this game or any apps made from this company to anyone!"
,Not Recommended,410570,22311850,"Posted: 8 April, 2016",all,aq.terryflap,"Not recommending this game solely because although it says ""Tracked motion controllers"", the game is 100% head-tracked, and it only uses the triggers primarily. Although the head tracking is pretty great, definitely not what I went in expecting.All that being said, it is a very fun game! The head tracking is spot on, and does make sense for the setting. It also looks pretty great.One minor issue I had was the intro cutscene gave me my first disorienting VR experience. When it went through the tiny spaceship compartments, that set off a bit of my claustrophobia as well, which was somewhat unsettling, but that doesn't last very long.To the devs: I'd recommend reevaluating the current intro scene. Give us some frame of reference, a ship or suit at least."

I know this is VR and the immersion is nice, but the gameplay doesn't bring anything new to the table. Especially considering this is made by CCP, I would expect way more, like switching to other turrets on the ship or some sort of really great storyline or some other interactions beyond look and shoot. It would be okay for under $5 or as a free promotion for Eve, but as a standalone game it's just not worth it."

Add to that the fact that the head tracking starting position changes with each mission launch, and the left and right buttons on the mouse are backwards from the tutorial controls and this game is a hot mess.  Not worth the money."

,Recommended,410570,24005069,"Posted: 1 July, 2016",all,arleas,"This is another VR game where you shoot enemies as they fly towards you.  However, this one does not benefit from room scale play areas, and furthermore, there's an annoying feeling that you're going to lose your balance as the turret/ship you're in moves.  I found myself having to turn sideways and brace myself so that I didn't accidentally lean over/back. Better to sit down and enjoy it since you don't need to move anything but your head anyway.In this game, you play the role of a turret gunner for an Eve Mining corporation fighting over a mining claim with other ships.  Aiming is as simple as looking at the enemy to move the crosshair, you pull the trigger on one of your vive controllers to shoot, you press the touchpad down to reload (which takes a few seconds).  If you pick up a powerup, you can use it by pressing the trigger on the left hand controller, but you can only hold one powerup at a time so use it or lose it.After completing a wave, you're rated on how many enemies you killed, and some other stuff that went by pretty fast, and overall you're rated 1-3 stars for your performance. Between each level you go back to a hub to choose the next mission (or to replay an older one if you didn't get the best score)Things I liked about this game:controls are simplethe aiming responds as quick as you can turn your headthere is some humorous dialogEach level is satisfying without being too short or too longYou can look down and see arms and legs, which adds to the realism of the sceneThings I didn't like:it's best if you're seated, but then again, it's a turret shooter so how much do you need to get up and move when you're seated in a turret?Standing during the opening scene made me feel as if I was being dragged backwards (I subconsciously started leaning forward to counter it)Once the game started with me standing, I didn't see an obvious way to reset the scene so I could sit down.  After that, if I sat down my face would have been inside the body of the player model.The reload takes a long time.  I'm not sure if it was shorter if I had bullets left or not, but I had to get in the habit of reloading every chance I got or I'd be reloading while missiles came flying at me.This is another solid VR game...I didn't play the whole way through so it's mostly a first impression of about 10-15 minutes worth. I look forward to going back and playing it some more though."

Asked for refund in 20 min. But it has nice grapics thoughI think it would be so easy.. to make a joystick with vive controllers, and control the thing. It seems like you have a cannon attached to your head and it weights nothing and everything just.. blow up on your sight. LIke you just can play with your mobile phone and a fire button.I wanted to control a big cannon, like.. heavy and a bit slow... feel the power. I expected a lot more.

,Not Recommended,410570,30983004,Posted: 6 April,all,Dr. Fortyseven,"I was on the fence about whether to thumb this up or down for a recommendation.  It's not an offensive game. It's just total fluff. At full price, it's absolutely not worth it. On sale for $3? Sure, why the hell not?Gunjack can be easily summed up as a repeatitive series of ""challenging stages"" from Galaga. Enemy craft fly at you in various formations, from a half-hemisphere in front of you. You target with your head tracking gaze, which actually works fairly well here, if your neck can take it.Occasionally a new craft will show up with some new trick up it's sleeve. There's power-ups to grab from destroyed enemies.But that's about it. It's just a simple turret shooter.  It got boring fairly quick, but you wind up sticking around for yet another round because... hell, I don't know why I stuck with it as long as I did. It's monotonous, but it does it's job competently... which is about as much of a kind word as I can give.Played on the Rift with mouse and keyboard. And SteamVR guilt-tripped me for trying to play with a gamepad, despite in-game menus expecting one. Whatever."

Showed my non gameplaying brother in law the other day and I couldn't get him off it!I found it very immersive (I could almost imagine myself in one of the turrets of the Millenium Falcon blasting away!)Waves get steadily harder. I can see myself coming back to this game, just to blast a few ships now and again.This idea could be great too if it were used in a B-52. Imagine blasting away from the different gun turrets as you fly in the 1000 bomber raids."

However, I got Gunjack bundled with Valkyrie and I actually like Gunjack better.  Yes, you aim with your head, but you can still use the buttons on the VIve controllers at least.  I mean, it's just a stationary wave shooter, but it's done pretty well.  Kind of like 3D Galaga.Anyway, a game like Space Pirate Trainer is still much deeper and more fun than Gunjack, so I can't even recommend paying $10 for Gunjack since SPT is only $15.  But if you've already gotten sick of all the other wave shooters for Vive, still want to play another one, and Gunjack is on sale?  Pick it up, it's worth a few bucks at least."

It works with the Vive touch controllers in spite of the warning when launching the game, they just might be mapped backwards. I also haven't had any luck getting it to see my 360 controller. It's still a fun game and worth the money. I'd give it an unqualified recommendation if they push a patch. It's still worth the money in the meantime."

I answered the initial thread because Gunjack Store page made no mention of being playable with/without VR. - See comment for detailsI bought it andNO, it wont launchwithout a VR headset plugged as well (Vive).The game actually refuses to launch if it does not detect the Vive:“This game requires a valid VR HMD to run.”When I sawSolo Player+Full Controller support+Windows(and nothing special in Recommended System Requirements section + being a port from Samsung Gear VR for Galaxy’s smartphones). I thought it would work without VR Headset [like many VR capable games in the Steam Store!] and offers a rails experience close to Titanfall...I can ask a refund butHey CCP, I expect no less from you but an update to enable a VR-free versioneven if it has to hurt gameplay… please :)"
,Recommended,410570,24071841,"Posted: 3 July, 2016",all,Game Cooker US Rocks VR,Well this game is basically a shooting game. It kind of reminds me of a highly sophisticated version of Galaga. You are a ship gun turret operater and have to blast enemies in space as they approach to attack. They come from right/left up and down and even from behind you. And there are harder ships to blast away at and you can get powerups too. It is pretty easy to play after you get used to aiming with your head. This is best played sitting down and I really don't play any sit down VR games but I suppose this one needs it. The good thing is you only need a chair to sit in and your motion controllers. A swivel chair is good as you can turn a little faster and if you have neck problems that would also help with that situation. On sale this is worth $5 but paying more well that would depend on how much you like these types of games. For me $5 would be the limit. The graphics are crystal clear which makes the whole experience that much more enjoyable.Tutorial and short game play here:https://youtu.be/kM-Kh7nK6E8
76561198304505708,Recommended,410570,31340241,Posted: 24 April,all,Kronos,"Love this game. It is very simple but loads of fun. It's like they took Galaga (one of my favourite old school arcade games) and made it into a VR game on steroids. The feeling of being able to look at your target and blast away is awesome. There's quite a lot of pontential for this game. Blowing up the incoming 'pirates' is very satisfying and there is a cool 'power-up' mechanic to help defeat the 'bosses'/larger ships.A couple of notes for those using Rift and Touch sensors : Open the game through Steam desktop mode (not 'Big Picture'), I had some issues running it from Big Picture mode for some reason (i.e. it didnt seem to work and/or recognise the controllers). Also, the game directs you to reload using the 'X' button on the left touch controller but, for me, it was actually the right thumbstick button (i.e. depress it to reload).For <$10, awesome fun."

In a way, decoupled version might've been a better option.No support for tracked controllers other than the buttons so that's a minus..."

Aiming is suprisingly intuitive, and the gameplay is quick and fun.  It's a wave shooter broken up into missions, and normally I dont like that at all, but I do here.  There is not a tone of content, but what is here is tight and well made.   The graphics are very good, especially for VR.  This one was worth full price, and always puts a smile on my face."
