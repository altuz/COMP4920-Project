The music itself, well there's barely any but that's a good advantage for this game! It's meant to make you think about this world and how horrible it is, knowing that it's all about the money and screw anyone who thinks differently (even just a tad!).The gameplay is just spot on; you're able to navigate around multiple worlds from the hub when unlocked and each area has its own look. The battle sequence is the usual turn by turn RPG style, but that's certainly not a bad thing at all! In fact, I'm glad that the battles are like this, as it makes me nostalgic.The writing, my GOD the WRITING! If you see this, TALK TO EVERY PERSON AND EXPLORE THE WORLD!!! The humor in this is glorious, taking its own environment and making little jokes about it (for example, a person very early in the game is called Loanrenzo)! not only this, but it references so many memes that are currently popular, such as Tai from Youtube (fuel units), Donald Trump (small loan of a million dollars), the clocks reading 4:20 and many more! Many a chuckle was had while playing this lovely gem of a game.I'm still not finished with this game yet, as I've only played for about an hour at this moment of time but my goodness it's amazing, I mean, why are you still reading this review? BUY IT!"

,Not Recommended,410670,20387458,"Posted: 7 January, 2016",all,MPO,"Trapped in a nearly suffocating world of dry pessimism, nonsensical humor, boring combat, lagging controls, and dull visuals: that's what it's like to play Suits.  It lacks nuance in its commentary and presentation, making for a drab, boring, and repetitive experience.  Yes, we get it, that's corporatism for you - but it's overkill in a medium where you need to hold the audience's attention.  Admittedly, this was accomplished well with the intial plot, but it couldn't make up for the rest of the experience, which just wasn't fun.  Again, perhaps that's the point - but this is supposed to be an interesting RPG, so there needs to be more redeeming qualities.Things I still liked: the plot, creative graphics despite budget art, the concept."

,Recommended,410670,21239422,"Posted: 15 February, 2016",all,Man Who Can Climb Anything,"TL;DR: If you hate constant internet culture jokes and references, this game is probably not for you. Otherwise, pretty good.Suits is a short RPG maker game heavily inspired by OFF. As one can see by the other reviews, the game's main selling point is its dark humor and the references it makes. The game refuses to take itself seriously all the way to the very end, and that can actually hurt the game's story at some points, even though the plot itself is pretty simple.The artstyle and the music are very unique and go along pretty well, strengthening the game's unsettling atmosphere.The gameplay is alright, but could use some improvement. There's a ton of secrets and optional events to find in every single area, which gives Suits some replay factor, but the battles are a bit too simplistic. Even though each character feels very different from the other two, the entire game can be beaten by using the same combination of 2-3 commands, only stopping every now and then to heal your party, but thankfully the game ends before this can become too repetitive.With all that said, though, this is definitely one of the most unique and interesting RPG maker games on Steam, and definitely worth every cent. I really hope to see a sequel in the future."

76561198094154627,Not Recommended,410670,20583319,"Posted: 17 January, 2016",all,ryanjames,"Where to start with this game? I wanted to like this game, the artstyle and surreal atmosphere/setting drew me in, having thoroughly enjoyed titles such as undertale and LISA, I imaged I was in for a similar ride. Unfortunately this was not so, this game was generally not very enjoyable, simply due to how it was executed. I'll start off with what I liked first though.If you don't want to read a wall of text, skip to the conclusion at the bottomThe artstyle is, very very interesting, it is something that has drawn alot of people in, it gives the game a unique feel, and enemy sprites were generally interesting to look at, surreal, pen drawn abominations in suits and political cartoons. Secondly, the music is another striking feature of this game. Like the art style, it is very atmospheric, and just fits very well with the setting of the game. There isn't loads of music, but there isn't a lack of it either. Another ""strong"" point of the game is the humour. I have mixed feelings about the humour, I did chuckle at the various references to modern politics and some puns did make me laugh, but at times the humour felt very forced, or just, didn't make any sense. Lastly, there is Jerome. Jerome is good.Now, onto the negative aspects, the first main issue is combat. Combat is extremely simplistic, you only ever have two party members (apparently there is a third somewhere?) with an incredibly simplistic and limited range of abilities. Fights mainly consist of stocking up on sandwichs, and just attacking enemies in a war of endurance. Sandwichs get you through this game, not any strategy. Random encounters are also extremely common and frequent. Secondly, there is plot, the game's plot is apparently a business man's descent into corruption.Well, not really, you complete a couple tasks for your capitalist overlords, and then, police attack you for some reason, and you somehow windup leading a revolution through a series of events that don't make sense. At the end of the game, the last boss decides to drop about 5 bombshells on you with no warning. Everything about the plot is dull, forced and just badly executed. Another strong negative point is the writing in general, again, everything is just forced. Some jokes, as stated did make me laugh, but there's alot of dialogue that, seemed to be a joke, but just wasn't funny. The last thing, is that, it just doesn't feel like there's any point to the game, it's wasted potential. This game is very quirky in some ways, with it's artstyle, curious setting and the fact that all plants have female names. There is potential here to make a really damn good and unique RPG. But this game fails to say anything about politics other than ""Corporations are bad!"" or really make you feel anything. The plot is just a series of events that happen.Oh, one very last point, Jerome should say more, you don't hear a peep from him after he becomes a party member, he could've been a great comic relief character.In conclusionProsGreat artstyleUnique musicInteresting settingJeromeHumour covers a diverse range of topics, seems to be based more on personal tastesExtremely cheapConsExtremely Monotonous gameplayHumour and writing seems forced at timesPlot doesn't make any sense, just a sequence of eventsPoor execution in general, wasted potentialNot enough JeromeAs a final point, other people seemed to have liked this game alot more, so it is quite possible you'll enjoy it more than me, plus the price is extremely low."
,Recommended,410670,22717182,"Posted: 29 April, 2016",all,Arishako,"The biggest drawback to this game, in my opinion, is the combat system. I'm a fan of turn-based combat in general, but this was terribly monotonous. This was mostly because it rarely seemed good to actually use your skills. The main character's regular attack quickly started doing about as much damage as his lowest cost offensive skill, and fights were generally over by the time I'd saved up enough TP for higher leveled ones. The first supporting character came with skills to attack all enemies at once, but the vast majority of the time I was fighting single opponents. Buffs and debuffs also felt to me like a waste of a turn in this game, although I might have just not had the right strategy. Most of the time, this wasn't too bad, but it made any area with random encounters feel like a pain just to slog through.The story is interesting enough to keep me engaged regardless of the combat. I'd say the writing can often be heavyhanded. There were times I got the impression that it was trying to hard to explain the joke/satire, which often ruined it. That said, there were also moments that worked really well and made me laugh, and also monsters that were unique. I'd recommend fans of RPGMaker-style games give it a shot."
,Recommended,410670,20553050,"Posted: 15 January, 2016",all,RenegadeQueen,For fans of Indie RPG's that like a little strangeness to their games. Definitely has replay value and for only a dollar that's plenty of gameplay time and weird story to absorb.
,Recommended,410670,20474987,"Posted: 11 January, 2016",all,Dare Evans,"So after completing everything there is to complete in this game, I can say that this was certainly worth the $0.65 that I paid for it, and I would recommend it at it's low price. Plus, I sold the trading card drops for $0.52, I believe? So, it was kind of only $0.13.That said, while the game has potential and charm, it's got plenty of very strange design choices and features that don't seem to work right. The most annoying of them being that interacting with objects takes place on the tiles around them, rather than the objects themselves. This means that unless you're standing in the right spot, nothing will happen when you search a crate, or look at something, which makes you think that nothing is supposed to happen. The art is pretty rough, but it's unique, at least. Anyone that avoids using RPG Maker's default assets deserves some credit. Soundtrack is wacky but enjoyable. Story is... something...One of the game's stronger points is probably it's use of references and humor. There were plenty of moments that I had a genuine laugh at.I've seen people imply that it's on the same level as LISA, and that's not even close to the truth, but I did enjoy my time with it. I'd definitely check out a sequel, as long as the price was kept as low as this was."

The game itself is bland. What makes Suits a fun game is the nonsensical humor within. I bought this game for ¥98 thinking it's just another poorly-made RPG that you see getting riffed on YouTube. My expectations were pleasantly surpassed.GraphicsThe graphics are deliberately♥♥♥♥♥ All the characters and objects look like a 5th grader's doodles on a notebook. It's obvious that no effort was made, literally, when everything is a scribble. The music is like outsider music, but not as bad as Crazy Bus or Dontrel Dolphin.All of it works well with the game.  The boring and uninspired art makes you feel like you're at some desk job with no clear description of what you do. It works with the drab and boring plot. It feel...businesslike.GameplayIt's an RPG Maker game. You fight, chat, and move. Combat is very simple and repetitive. I really don't have to use many special attacks to defeat the enemies, even for bosses. It feels more like doing work than playing a game.The plot is simple. You are a new hire. Suddenly, the CEO gets threatened by you and tries to kill you. Because of so many side quests, I often forget what I'm supposed to do. But the gameplay is so simple, and the area is laid out is such a linear path that I can still progress.OriginalityI have to say, I don't see many games where everything is intentionally bad. You can tell the developer didn't even try to make a game. Why would they, when everything is already made for you via RPG Maker? Instead, most of the work was spent on side quests, containing bizarre and non sequitur jokes. I would call this an unique outsider game.FunDespite all the sloppiness and half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥job this game is, it's still amusing. The humor is good and I'm always given something unexpected. It's lowbrow and juvenile humor, but it's delivered at the right time in a bland and boring game. It's ¥98 worth of fun, and it delivers on that.ClosingSuits is a weird game at the least. Is awful and stupid, but in no way is it boring. The humor is great. It's a bag of odd jokes that's tied up by a flimsy game. Is it worth the dollar? Absolutely! You have to try it to get a feel of just how the humor works so well. Good doing business with you."

If you don't enjoy it, you will after playing this game+ Subtle deeper message, that isn't shoved in your face+ Plays like a simple, oldschool, turn-based JRPG+ It took me about 4 hours to beat this game, so if you're looking for a cheap, little RPG to kill some time, definitely consider this one+ It has a feeling of a weird dev's childhood fantasy to it, which makes it really cute in my opinion+ General concept- The artstyle might not be everybody's cup of tea- I kinda found the endboss fight to be... lame- There is one sidequest where you have to wait 5 minutes and you can't be tabbed out of the game during this time frame because the ingame time won't pass otherwise- The core of this game lies at its hilarious dialogues, object interactions and humour in general. If you aren't into the game's kind of jokes, you possibly won't enjoy it- It may be a little difficult at some points, if you don't plan on fighting most of the enemies and rather skipping them- The general bossfight strategy stays the same throughout the game- Although the game's concept and story is great, it lacks in presentation at some points. You may not fully understand what's going on if you don't follow the dialogues attentively- If you are not into indie games in general, chances are you won't enjoy Suits. I've tried to come up with a better explanation for this statement, but let me just put it like that: Where Undertale is considered to be extremely ""tumblr"", Suits is tremendously ""indie""- Aside from the humour, the gameplay itself is kinda repetitive. You run around fighting enemies, buying stuff, healing yourself, talking to NPCs and plants and finding yourself in odd situations=> To recap everything I've just said:If you enjoy experimental, indie rpg games that are comical and odd in their own way, you're most likely going to enjoy Suits. If you aren't amused by it's humour and feel bored due to the gameplay, you might wanna avoid picking this up."

I stumbled upon this and simply bought it because I was looking to expand my library and it wasdirt cheap. The real selling point for this game, for me at least, was the fact it was only $.99. If it were any more I probably would not have purchased it. Luckily, I did purchase it and i'm quite glad I did. Ill list some pros and some cons:PROS:- Simple- ""Good"" models- Somewhat simple story (can be a con aswell)- Cheap- Personally, I like the artists style- the jokes- Trading cards- AchievementsCONS:- Not particularly long- Battle sequences could be spiced up a littleGame was fun and could easily be worth $2-$5. Although this might make some people not see as high a Game-to-Price ratio. Still enjoyed it and would encourage the dev to continue to create games."

,Recommended,410670,29028617,Posted: 5 January,all,Byers Hintz,"Suits: A Buisness RPG is definatly something else.  While at first glance this game just looks like a quirky game with a unique artstyle created in RPG Maker, its underlying message about corprate corruption and money in general is quite powerful. You go through the game as The Guy, (or whatever you named him I guess), on a quest to take out the C.E.O.s  of each district, fighting hobos, loan sharks, and some very out there creatures along the way. There are a ton of little side things that you can also do that really bring out this games personality, and give some replay value if you missed out along the way. The gameplay isn't too much to talk about, (again, this is an rpg maker game), and unfortunatly, there is almost no difficulty. However, it's made very clear that this game is more about the expirience itself rather than mechanics, similar to OFF, another RPG maker game, which is clearly an inspiration here. I would give this game a 7/10. I enjoyed this games humor and story from begining to end, however I do have a few complaints. First of all, as previously mentioned, this game is a cakewalk. Even if you ignore the final party member and just take Gerome, you will still most likely be fine. And while these are mostly just nitpicks, I found that the sprites really ruin the astetic of the rest of the game, and i think they should have been made in the same sketchy style everything else was done in. Lastly, and probably least importantly, overworld objects have weird detection and you can usually clip through them when walking. Other then that, i still think this is a great game. And at one dollar are you really risking anything? I would recomend Suits: A Business RPG to anyone who enjoys story driven RPGs, or just weirder ones in general."

I'm very glad I did.Suits a business RPG is a role playing game where you take up the role of a businessman who just graduated from business school. Since cooperations rule the planet in this universe.For me the humor was on point and reminds me a bit of Rick and Morty, just enough dark humor and unexpected twists in it that makes it funny for me. 4th wall breaking, Easter eggs, and dark humor.Gameplay wise it reminds me of Earthbound. There is some level grinding and yes there is no free healing, however that is usually how this genre of RPG works. There is some grinding, but I never got tired of it, mostly because I kept wandering around into random peoples' houses.Usually I don't like bringing up the graphics since that is never the selling point for me, however I think it fits the dystopian 1984 vibe the developers were going for. The hand drawn backgrounds makes the game a bit more memorable in my eyes.Honestly the best part about this game besides the concept and humor is the exploration. I usually just wander around and loot everything in sight. Which leads me to discover things, I won't spoil anything since playing this game without knowing anything that pops up is satisfying.Also it is not an Undertale clone, I know my Undertale playtime isn't much, but I have played on another friend's account quite a bit to understand the gameplay and mechanics. They are similar only because of the genre they are in. 2D turn based RPGs. It is like saying every tennis video game ever conceived is a rip off of pong. Or every FPS is a ripoff of Doom. (Note: Undertale is an awesome game, I still highly recommend it, I just saw people calling this game a ripoff.)My final verdict:Suits is a good game, although humor isprobably going to fuel most of your enjoyment if you don't like the visuals or gameplay. So Suits isn't for everyone, but it is very lowly priced so honestly it is worth a shot. Plus steam refund exists now if you really really don't like the game that much.Pros:Good humorNice visualsInteresting conceptExplorationGood sound (when there is any)Isn't an Undertale ripoff like many people seem to think.Cons:Lack of soundGrindingCan be difficult for newcomers to the genre.9/10"

In all honesty, I liked OFF a little more, but I did enjoy this game. For a dollar, it's totally worth it, even if it's only a couple hours long.The gameplay itself wasn't very inspired. I found myself using the same three strategies the entire game: Use Staple Down to disable strong, single enemies, use Staple Storm to beat groups, and attack the rest of the time. Ultimately, you should sail through it, as long as you be sure to get the best equips at all times. One interesting note is that most of your funds come from doing optional things, rather than only battling. That's pretty cool, because it gives you a reason to explore a little, even thought it's not exactly a vast world.The visuals are very unique and interesting, but if you don't love the general uniqueness, you'll likely hate it, because it's all drawn in black and white. The music is pretty good actually, though not good enough to go searching Youtube for it. Overall, I'd say these are both nice for what they are.The most important thing is the adventure, despite everything previously mentioned. The story is an interesting social commentary, with witty bits of comedy scattered through the entire game. The generallly cynical atmosphere is a great change of pace, and the whole game experience is one huge satirical parody of the greed and corruption of those in power and the mundane lives people are programmed to live, working as small cogs their whole lives for these powers. It's really frightening to have to accept this reality, but it's unfortunately accurate. People are expected to live as workers. As for the corporate and political corruption, that's all true as well, just not to a degree where society is openly a place where justice is bought, the poor are used as spare parts and people are punished for not buying things. You cannot deny that there are scandals, however. I believe the CEO of McDonald's once stated that if any of his competitors were to drown, he'd put a hose in their mouth.To wrap things up, this game is not expensive at all and a very unique experience, and I would reccommend it for those reasons."

Got the game for a song and I thought it was worth the price.You play an all purpose businessman in an exaggerated black and white capitalist universe, where everything is a satire of everything that goes along with the nature of economics, politics, entertainment, etc. Enemies are hand drawn in a rough style, with some of them being parodies of real world people. There's a great deal of 420 humor, references, and some♥♥♥♥♥♥jokes. I found a lot of it just blurred together.You can control up to 3 unspeaking characters, although I was able to finish the non-joke ending with just 2, as the third arrives very late in the game. Outside of one or two moments, the game is not hard whatsoever. Combat is extremely simple and requires little to no resource hoarding, nor tactics. I wasn't a fan of that- it's a little too basic. I got through the entire game with just my main character auto attacking and my one side character doing an ability with a single crowd control effect, with the rare occasion of using an area effect attack. You don't really get interesting abilities and a LOT of what you have is too expensive to use more than one or twice without reloading resources out of battle, but you don't really need those abilities either.At about 4 hours long, taking my time, but not grinding anything for xp, the game is of fair length for the price. It's not an amazing title in the sense of other really 'out there' indie games like OFF, Yume Nikki, or Space Funeral, but it's fair for what it is and I don't think it's trying to be anything more than that. And that's really just how Suits is. It's not terribly interesting to read the text in the game and the imagery is fairly dull, but it's not bad either. It's just average. I am, however, figuring the price of the game into this. You get what you pay for, and for that, it's quite fair. I didn't mind playing it, it just didn't 'wow'."

OFF had a much better battle theme, and more pleasant backgrounds, and what felt like a more avant garde tone.I wish it could've had a deeper meaning, I spent the last half of the game speeding through trying to find meaning behind what was happening, and came up with nothing concrete.In the game there are no women, I can't recall anyone being defined as a man either, but everyone is the same suited person, much like the famous anonymous avatar.Suits with it's references feels more like commentary on internet culture than it does on buisness/corporations.The controls are slippery, interacting with objects is often iffy, in the combat most moves are completly useless, building up TP is near impossible, even at the final boss with the best gear I couldn't build up the TP to ever use the ultimate move.  Combat never felt like a challenge, I had one KO of a party member and it was a one hit kill move.It's worth playing, if it's not a strain on your eyes, for a dollar on sale it's worth it.

What's nice is that it's well paced in that you don't really need to grind as long as you don't skip every encounter.

You play as The Guy (no really), just another Suit in Suit City, where Corporations run everything and your worth begins and ends with your work output.  What begins as a simple job to sue an uncooperative potential buyer quickly spirals into a conspiracy and civil war, with you stuck in the middle.Gameplay is the standard RPG Maker combat.  Its turnbased, and the enemies are surprisingly colorful, varied and unique.  Most of the enemies are handplaced and unique.  In fact, random encounters don't actually become commonplace until halfway through the game after a certain plot development.The game really shines in its writing.  It is an unapologetic pastiche of capitalism, materialism, and other kinds of -isms.  Its wacky, surreal, and surprisingly dark at times.Its short, but given the low low price its acceptable.  If you want a quick, quirky and fun RPG, give it a go.  Its literally pocket change."
,Recommended,410670,20577247,"Posted: 16 January, 2016",all,orpe11,"TL;DR: A decent RPGMaker game with a fairly unique art style and aesthetic. Nothing outstanding about it, but the low price point and short play time means it doesn't overstay its welcome.The first point of comparison to this game comes easily to OFF, an RPGMaker game made with a similar aesthetic style. The comparisons are really only skin deep though, as the game itself is much shallower than its inspiration. While the inspiration for this game is freely available and this costs about a dollar, it doesn't mean you should pass this up entirely.It is clear that this is not a work of laziness at all. The art style is consistent and the enemies encountered tend to be fairly unique, with the exceptions of random encounter areas and a few repeated enemies. The sprites and hand drawn works fit well together, and nothing looks jarringly out of place. The only offense art wise is that practically all encounters start by talking to a generic looking suited dude, who turns out to be something far more interesting in the combat screen. Some of them could have used unique sprites, but that is a small complaint.Game-play is bog standard. You start with one character, and can acquire two more through a bit of exploration. Notably, the first party member is easily missed if you don't take the time to get him, and he can be lost forever, just like the second one. If the game suffers anywhere, it is that the game is exceedingly easy if you have a remote skill at RPGs. Every encounter, boss or not, can be solved by a combination of the second characters staple ability to paralyze them, and then wailing on them till it needs repeating. Some healing might be required, but the game doles out cash and healing/recovery items quite often. Any more complex strategies are not needed, and there are no elements or weaknesses to worry about, and very few buffs get used outside boss self-buffs or debuffs. No grinding is really necessary, but the game could have used some variety in the challenge, as there is really nothing to differentiate bosses from each other, other than attack animations and some spikes in damage.The story is clearly trying to style itself after OFF, with that weird world-vibe, dystopian appeal, and twisted characters in battle. The main way it falters is that the game really doesn't build on the world at all. OFF has characters telling tales to you as you go through the areas, and its clear the place has a mythology. This game attempts that, but so much of its writing is spent telling one-off pop culture jokes and references that any potential world building is lost. Half of your encounters are jokes or references to something, when the game time could have been spent building the world. Where OFF tells a story of a world where everything is, well, off, this game tells a story about a world where everything is a reference that will become dated in time, with a vague plot about huge faceless corporations and drones beneath.In summary, the game is short, cheap, and doesn't overstay its welcome. It hints at a sequel, and it would be nice if they built on what they have to be more than pop-culture references, but that is not in this game. Buy it, play it for four hours or so to fully complete it, and decide for yourself if you want to give the developers a chance to further develop it."

,Not Recommended,410670,31520432,Posted: 3 May,all,Fauxy,"I think I would have given this a thumbs up under a lot of conditions. If it was less popular for example, I would be moved to have a bit of pity for creators who have obviously put in some effort and simply lacked creativity or talent in some regard. Or if it wasn't in a genre I've played so much of and have so much to compare it to, RPG maker games that seek to subvert classic RPG style storytelling. Or maybe if it had, as a comedy game, made me smile even once during the entirety of the four hours I gave it. Alas, none of those conditions are in effect.Suits: A Business RPGis just... not good.As a turn-based RPG it is a mediocrely designed, adds nothing new to the formula, random enemy grind where your first character does damage, your second character stuns the single member enemy parties you fight for 90% of the game, and you never bother with anything else because this combination kills everything in a slow and sure manner. Until you get a third character much too late in the game, at which point you can just keep spamming confirm to attack for every fight.As a story, this game is nothing but a vehicle for memes and pen15 jokes. If I had to explain to someone what lowest common denominator humor looked like, this game would be it. I suppose it grows some cliché anti-corporation popcorn and dead braincell plot towards the end, but that's all largely inconsequential in comparison to the game having a room full of popular Youtubers drawn as monsters, which I think is supposed to be funny? But there's no joke. It's literally just Youtubers with mildly stupid names based on their online personas. Because that in itself is funny right?How can I not compare this game to the likes ofLisa: The Painful RPG,OFF,Middens,Space Funeralor even (less relatedly)Undertale? It blatantly copies off the homework of the first two and still manages to fail the test. It certainly doesn't have the grounding in strong character and characterization based humor ofUndertale, or the benefit of having the backbone of a powerful thematic statement likeMiddensorLisa: The Painful RPG. It doesn't even manage to be as surreal as games likeOFForSpace Funeral, the games I care the least for of this ragtag bunch, because rather than creating a world and humor of its own it just riffs off of what's topical now and what might be completely forgotten in five years time. It doesn't even succeed at making any of that funny or compelling.And you can say, well, it's dirt cheap. Why have such high standards for it? Some of those games I'm comparing it to are FREE.This is a game where, it just seems like, the work is there but the creativity isn't. Sometimes that gap just can't be breached. It's not particularly polished but it's for the most part functional, and complete. It takes a lot of self deprecating stabs at itself and the devs' previous game, so I kind of feel like the devs weren't expecting the positive reviews? Again, there's something underdoggish about it that makes me want to pity it, but since so many people have already signed in favor of it, I might as well tell it like it is.It's not funny. It's not fun. It doesn't do anything interesting or say anything meaningful. The art is sloppy.  The fighting is tedious. The story is stupid. The overworld only lets you interact with boxes from certain directions. There is occasional lag. The game is using sound effects that come default with RPG Maker. The memes are not dank.TL;DR: No."

The humor is painfully unfunny, and consists almost entirely of references to memes, ""random"" nonsequiters, and ""dark"" humor that tries WAY too hard to be shocking.

Now I know the game is actually way too cheap.Suits: A Business RPG is one of those video games I'd recommend to anyone who thinks all indie games are just gimmicky, cash grabs with minimum effort put into them.A lot of attention went into this game, from the NPCs to the turn based fighting system; I can't find a fault with this game. The turn based fighting system is actually very fairly balanced, and never did I find myself thinking the game was too difficult or too easy. Even the black and white, doodlish style that might turn people off works in the game's favor. It perfectly reflects the bland, mass produced dystopia of a monopoly controlled world where even human life is treated as nothing more than capital gain or loss. It also has a very neat, brilliant ending I dare not spoil. These were some of my highlights.Cancelling that horrible showThe Big BangTheory, I mean, The Huge Boom HypothesisWent on an acid trip that taught me the meaning of lifeGot the Keys to SuccessFound a secret room full of shirtless menMet the very sexually attractive game devs whom were not falsely portayed in any way shape or form. Obviously. Only the most perfect men can create such a perfect game.Simply put, it's a fun game. Some reviews assert the game only mocks one topic and bashes it into the ground, but there is so much more to the humor than that.For example, every clock in the game reads either 4:20 or 7:30. You only find out why once you find a piece of paper in a cabinet on a left wing of a building detailing how scientists snuck something into the water supply so the populace would only see these two times. It was actually a very cleverly hidden joke making fun of conspiracy theorists on top of a 420 reference. Blaze it.I feel as long as you don't take anything too seriously and appreciate straightforward humor you'll enjoy the game for what it is."

,Recommended,410670,20840497,"Posted: 29 January, 2016",all,AngelHalo,"I have to say that Technomancy Studios offers this game at a really modest price, and I can see why.The things I really enjoyed about this game is the overall presentation.  It's nice, unique, and I can appreciate the crudely drawn graphics and weird sound track.  Some may say that it draws parallels with OFF (a free game), and LISA (another steam game), and that wouldn't be too far from the truth, but not entirely correct either.  It ends up being its own unique experience from beginning to the end that is worth sitting through, along with its many comedic moments to break up the otherwise dark and demented atmosphere.With that said, there are problems I have with this game that is hard to complain about because of its value.  However, as I do appreciate the end product, I feel the need to address this in hopes to see improvement in the future.For one thing, the battle system may look like it has a decent amount of options, but there is hardly any strategy and variety involved.  Most of the special moves the protagonist can perform have a high miss chance (so I've noticed).  Even the move that lets him recharge his TP has a chance to not work at all, which I find ridiculous.  It gets to the point that his special abilities that he earns are just underminded entirely.  Once you recruit Jerome, the game just gets easy from there to where I just employed one strategy: attack with the Protagonist, use the staple move with Jerome to stun the enemy (or staple storm if there are multiple).  Once the enemy is stunned, keep spamming attack (or briefcase toss if possible), and repeat until I win.  Early on, you do have to manage your inventory, but any novice can catch on and abuse this strategy quickly.  Just remember to upgrade your equipment every now and then, have some healing items and water bottles for Jerome, and you never need to change up your strategy.  Once you recruit the third party member, the game just gets stupidly easy from there.  I'm not asking for anything complex, but I feel that the combat system really bogged down the overall experience for me.  It hurts that there is hardly any replay value.  I am aware that there is a hidden ending, but that involves getting the one item that you lose forever once you've completed half the game.  Some of the jokes presented at the end game felt forced too in retrospect.Should that steer your decision from buying the game?  Honestly, I cannot say.  The price does make the experience worth while over all despite the lack of replay value, and I still encourage you to at least give this game a try.

Upon playing it for about fifteen minutes however, you realize you've come across a gem. Suits: A Business RPG is a hilarious take on white collar culture in the form of a Final Fantasy 4-esque RPG. You'll do battle with demented coffee cups, evil corporate bosses (putting a whole new meaning on “boss fight”), and other business-related denizens using staplers and other office supplies in a turn-based battle system. The game is divided into five main areas, and can be completed in about 2 to 2.5 hours if you stick to completing the main quest. Finding all the secret areas and cleverly hidden jokes within the game however, may take you upwards of 3 to 4 hours, due to the sheer number of Easter eggs included. The developers could have charged more for the game, and I would still feel like I got my money's worth, on merit of the game's humor, story, and Easter eggs."

As there are so many bad RPGMaker gamesThis game is actually a big surprise. By the terms of gameplay, it's still the good old system we know from, for example, Final Fantasy.Well it is exalcy like final fantasy . You walk around with your arrow keys , checkig crates for some weird items with spacebarand sometimes you will get attacked by an enemy just like in Final fantalsy you know what i mean . Enemies in this game is weid in a funny way .You will have to fight flying coffe mugs ,  ties ghost and at one point there is a dude called wife beater .What makes this game great is the hilarious jokes , punds and the grey ironic every day life atmosphere -They have made jokes of almost everything! Undertale-like puns? Check. Gaming critique? Check. Culture references? Check. Political humour? Check.Controversial humour? Check!Well i got to say this graphics look lazy but some how it didin't hurt my eyes , i really felt the borning office atmosphere and when you add so many cooljokes to that atmosphere it becomes even more hilarious .Jokes in every corner  , Unique graphics style that perfectly fits the comedy in the game ,Very low price on steam makes this game a must buy . Oh waitdid i mentioned this game has 35 steam achievments , that is a very nice touch . awesomewell there is one nitpcik for me , sometimes it feels like the game really needs a repel ,because every few steps the enemys jumps out of nowhere and the instant grinding can be a little bit anoiyng .

That's the standard stuff out of the way, so let's get into the weird.  Suits starts you off as The Guy, another businessman in line to join the ranks in a world run entirely by corporations, built as corporations. The satire of consumerism and greed is done well, and helps to add to the game's very offbeat sense of humor. The jokes range from the clocks always set to 4:20 as it's simplest, to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on a dinosaur's floor at its strangest. This, along wth the setting and atmosphere is what I think makes Suits such a fun game; it's absurd while still being relevant to modern times. The Payday 2 microtransactions joke is a good example, and is done well. The story itself is rather straightforward; notes are placed around to provide back story and clues and the ending sums up the purpose of the world itself and your actions nicely. Oh, and the art and music. Some people were put off by the crude sketch design and music; personally I found them both surrelastic, funny and disturbing enough that they made a perfect fit for the plot.To sum it up, Suits is a straightforward PRG mechanically; there are some special abilities like a instant kill that only works 1% of the time, and being able to pay your enemies to lose. There's not much that changes the gameplay itself from other RPG's; instead the focus is on the creative art of the game. Whether you'll like this or not will depend on what you're looking for in an RPG game, but for it's price it's got a decent story length to it and potential for follow up. Also: dinosaur dinosaur diunosaur dinosaur dinosaur"

I was able to complete Suits in about 4 hours, however those 4 hours were quite dense with content. The art style of Suits is akin to OFF, Space Funeral(2 tablets to paradise), and Thank God for the Rain(never completed). The gameplay is like a typical RPGMaker game, so it's not overly complicated in any way. You don't have to grind very much, and if you buy the equipment upgrades every now and again, you'll be fine. There's a handful of silly political missions to be done if you take up the jobs offered by the left and right wings in some areas, but what I found to be the most interesting political aspect of Suits is that the game seems to take a more bipartisan stance (well, okay, there WERE some marxist themes to be fair...) to politics and focuses more on The Guy's process of detangling the grip of an unregulated, dominating corporation(stick it to the man, man.) on Suits City. It seems to paint politics as a side issue to a larger one at hand, rather than weaving a less than subtle political agenda into it.I found the save feature to be amusing, but would've liked a health/FU/MP restore upon save like other RPGMaker games, but that's not entirely necessary as you can restore your health easily with some disposable income. You can also skip one of the tasks if you take the secret passage in one of the bushes to the left of the W. bank if you want to get into the bank in the Financial district faster.My favorite songs (in the BGM folder) would have to be WallPuncher, AdvancedSharkness, and PainStation; each were catchy but unique while supplying the game's environment with an almost ambient sense of dread.Or maybe it's just Marxist overthrow simulator....Lastly, check out the bushes on top of the office building for a fun little reference, go into the painting, and of course THANK YOU BASED MJ(I might go back and edit this eventually if I remember anything I might've missed.)"

,Recommended,410670,33280352,Posted: 5 July,all,FreedVoid,"Fairly entertaining game that was well worth its price. Going through the game, it reminded me of Lisa with it's weird and bizarre nuances and whips that constantly redraw in your attention. The art style at first look can be a bit dissuading to some especially with the contrast between the pixel graphics and the handmade drawings; however, it certainly does have have a charm to it that instills a unique feeling of both adoration and eeriness. The music at times was okay to listen to at times, however at others you can easily be irritated (just beeps and more beeps). Most irritating though was interacting with objects and movement. At some times, you could just interact with an object or not as other objects nearby were taking priority and movement definitely felt a bit loose. In regards to the story, it's simple yet laid out - not too complex but easy to follow - with you going from a corporate flunky to a corporate revolutionary.What there is to love most about this game is definitely the humor. As aforementioned, the game has its weird and bizarre nature, which is most explored through the dialogue. You want to interact with everything for the unexpected wits of dialogue. The media references are also in abundance as long as you can get what is being referenced, and it's a heck of a lot of fun seeing how the devs play off of everything. This gives you even MORE reason to want to check everything out for maximum enjoyment. You'll even get some achievements out of it (If you are going after these, I advise saving in a different slot after certain story points just in case you miss something).All in all, it's a bang for your buck sorta game. All you need to do is learn to not hoard healing items and use them to grind for a bit and things will play out smoothly.  It'll be fun to go through so try it out."

In one of the later dungeons, when it goes to load a random encounter, the game just hangs on the loading screen. This is on the mac version of the game, and I checked the forum and found other people with the same problem, on the same platform. So that sucks.The art-style is charming, and the plotting is a dystopian satire that sometimes hits and sometimes misses, loaded with lots of self-consciously goofy jokes. The raw mechanical game itself is honestly kind of bad. It's just completely bog standard RPG Maker/Dragon Warrior type stuff, and really unevenly designed. For example, you'll enter one area with lots of easy monsters that give tons of gold and experience that you can grind, but in the very next area the monsters are way harder, but give substantially less experience and gold. Just kind of screwy stuff like that. So you're mostly playing it for the world, the exploration, and the novelty."

In a depressing and cruel corporate world full of shady, funny and down right bizarre characters. Even throwing in refrences to games, movies and shows. Overall I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RPG games."

Full of memes and good time, tho the fight system is juts choose attack until the fight is over but some of the boss battles require a bit of strategy. all in all everyone should get this game. Also all the digs they take at other games in this is great, payton has some not nice words to say about overkill."
,Recommended,410670,32558284,Posted: 18 June,all,The Ambiguous Sod,"I bought this cheap and had that in mind when writing this review.This game is nothing special. The humour and battle system (of which is very repetative) can be found many other places and will continue to be found. The scenery and general game looks as if it's been drawn by a six year old and the game offers very little recovery if you forget where or what you need to do...I still recommend this game because it looks like it's been drawn by a six year old, has a sense of humour I, personally, find enjoyable and quite frankly; I could take speed and have a virtual heart attack as opposed to a real one.Suits won't chnage your life but it can certainly fill up a few hours and have you chuckling at various points through them. That is of course if the humour of suits, suits (see what I did there) your humour in the day to day world.I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase this and wouldn't spend more than 99p on it but I did enjoy it nonetheless."

I barely played much of it currently but this is a undertale style Jrpg most likely made in RPGmaker. The game has funny moments like the law case with the plant and the dead man and has a good mix of difficulty and variety. Would reccomend."
,Recommended,410670,32904235,Posted: 27 June,all,Megasourusrex,"Has strong OFF vibes in terms of art style, but the story is well put together and it made me chuckle a few places. I highley recommend this. Took me 6 hours to go through it but I examined every little thing and could be finished in half the time probably. If you fight every monster you run into you should level up enough to defeat bosses easily so no need for grinding. It's just a nice experience to pass the time with if you don't want to play a long game."

Witha classic but amazing battle system. Plus, an amazing sense of humor. Plus, the low price of only $1. You should get this game in a minute."

Its only about 4-5 hours if you get all the acheivements. However I can't complain because of how cheap the game is and had it beern sold for any higher this review would have been negative."

Combat can be a fair bit unfair, humor's a bit questionable, but if you don't have anything else important to do it can be fun enough."

The sprites are good enough to distract you from the pain of your quickly developing arthritis.Music is great, lends very nicely to the atmosphere.Story was very clever with its social commentary, it balanced the extreme examples with humor very well. Actually made me think about some stuff.Overall, very worth 1$, if you're bored and wanna just play a fun game for a couple hours, this is it. Had a lot of good laughs from it."
