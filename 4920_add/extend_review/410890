,Recommended,410890,19115832,"Posted: 16 November, 2015",all,Flotilla,"Watanagashi, the second chapter of the episodic Higurashi series, has finally crept onto Steam. As expected from the stellar work done on CH1, MangaGamer have not disappointed in makingWatanagashia worthwhile purchase:Unlike the previous (non-Steam) MG localization of Higurashi, no licensing issues hinder this release. The original music is fully intact as it was in the original release nearly 13 years ago.Like CH1, the translation quality of this release far surpasses the 2009 MG localization or the various fanslation projects, owing to MangaGamer's decision to retranslate this behemoth from scratch. Wordplay, idioms, descriptions, characterizations, all are delicately handled in a way that immerses the reader without straying from the original transcript; in many situations, comparing this new translation to the old is like night and day.Detailed new character art has been provided for the user's convenience, replacing the original low-res Ryukishi art if so desired. Alternatively, those who prefer the original art have the option to switch between the two on the fly by pressing 'P'. Going even further beyond these options, MangaGamer's intentional decision to allow modding of Higurashi's graphic assets means that discerning fans can even go as far as using the PS2 character sprites, or the PS3 backgrounds, or even custom fanmade sprites. Even voice mods using the VO of the older console releases of Higurashi are popping up, thanks to the flexibility provided by this rerelease's engine.I can only assume if you're reading this review for CH2 you were (rightfully) in love with CH1 and wanted to see if MangaGamer's handling of CH2 is up to snuff. The answer is a resounding 'yes', and you should go out of your way to support such an excellent release."

,Recommended,410890,31748896,Posted: 14 May,all,Faudraline,"I will not quench your thirst, for you seek the truth and could not accept that.I will not quench your thirst, for the truth you desire does not exist.But I still want to quench your thirst, for I am the one who cast you into the desert. - Frederica BernkastelWell, here comes the second chapter ofHigurashi When They Cryseries:Ch.2 - Watanagashi. It is equally ambiguous in its narrative and mysterious with its story pacing just as the first game, yet this time its revelations hold more of a chilling murder/mystery rather than a supernatural horror compared to the first game. The game is just as good though, feeding into your curiosity furthermore by presenting a storyline that doesn't fit with the timetable of events presented to us in the previous game.Completing the first game - I detest spoilers, so I'll try to be vague as possible when it comes to plot points - it should be obvious that it is impossible for both games to be part of the same timeline. Even though, the core story elements are more or less the same with the first game - in which you are Keiichi Maebara who has just moved into the silent town of Hinamizawa and befriended a bunch of girls with quirky characters - the dynamic and events themselves in nature completely differ. Sure, we go through a sweet, careless period with girls from Keiichi's perspective; and after the night of the Watanagashi festival everything takes a turn for the creepy and mysterious. But this time we are presented with some kind of a ""what if"" scenario. This time, Keiichi isn't present during the festival, since he's been busy breaking a taboo alongside Takano Miyo, Tomitake Jiro and a newly introduced character in this arc:Shion Sonozaki, our beloved friend Mion's little sister.This arc takes a turn to shed some light into the background of all three families leading Hinamizawa - clans Sonozaki, Kimiyoshi and Furude. Alongside many narrative details that we are already familiar with, this new game brings in a closer perspective to Sonozaki clan,and Sonozaki twins themselves respectively. Being the second question arc in the series, it arises more questions rather than answering old ones, but the game is invaluable for its quality on introducing a thorough history of the village, including both the folklore narrative and actual historical facts, very useful to explain the local psycho-dynamic for the village.As we've been able to observe in the first game, the narrative pacing heavily relies on sound effects, soundtrack pieces and the timing of them to be introduced with appropriate narrative sequences. Through this formula, a cheery scene may suddenly turn into an uncanny one; and a dramatic moment may suddenly turn into a full throttle horror scene. Everything within the game relies on this element of absurd consequentiality, keeping you on your toes.It may be important to note that this storyline is a bit more brutal compared to the first one, since we have mostly observed a period of dreadful paranoia, alongside some not very closely examined murder occurrences inOnikakushi. Here, we'll travel down into the belly of the beast, dealing with more death scenarios, more gore scenes and probably more psychotic monologues than necessary. I sure do love the series but I cannot handle villain monologues well, so there has been moments that I couldn't wait for someone specific to shut up... Oh, well, it ended up being satisfying in its own right anyhow.Ready? Here it comes then. It's the same pattern: carefree days of youth and friendship, followed by a brutal mystery that ends up with an eerie, eerie trauma. Result? There is a village named Hinamizawa... There, weird and brutal things happen all the time. I am yet to see any kind of good ending in these series. Well, we'll see. 2 games down, 6 to go.

Basically, this is the second chapter for the Higurashi VN series, if you couldn't tell. It continues with where Onikakushi left off in the story. This series is honestly very great, it gives you mixed emotions depending on the situation you're in. One minute, you could be laughing due to everyone having fun and playfully hitting each other, next minute, everyone could be dead.This whole series is much worth it for the smallish price Steam charges for the games that have come out/coming out."

Even at the slight price jump, this chapter is worth it.This VN was an emotional roller coaster for me. The writing got better here then in Onikakushi. The story starts out as a fun humorous experience in the vein of Gintama I'd say with some of the ridiculousness. It then subtly lays the ground the plot ahead, but while it does this, at the midway point it kind of drags. After this midway point, you move onto the mystery part of the story. After this I cried. A lot. I've seen the anime and know the series plot already and all its secrets so maybe it made me cry because I knew what was to come. But the writing for the emotions of Keichi could not be captured like how an anime could try. His personal struggle with each event was heart wrenching. While it was limited to a single perspective unlike the anime (which showed more of the truth), it did a better job of conveying a story and the emotion behind it. The reused bgms still feel a little out of place and cheap imo, but the new ones that play late in the VN fit the mood perfectly and make it all the more emotional. This VN is simply wonderful and probably the best to come onto Steam.11/10 - Would cry like a little ♥♥♥♥♥ again"

That should be enough for you to buy the game :^)...On a more serious note,the game costs more than the first part but I guess Watanagashi is a little longer than Onikakushi. It is worth at its full price.The ""graphics"" didn't change, the characters are still as cute as they were. (Rikaaaaaaaa Meoww)New ost themes appeared which is quite good, I was getting irritated by the citadas haha.And when it comes to the story, well, the game can make you laugh but also make you feel very uneasy. If you liked the first part you would surely enjoy this one as well, the chapter 2 is more focused on the Sonozaki family as you can guess and you get to know more about the plot!Probably the best visual novel you could ever buy.Now I'm just sitting there waiting for chapter 3.Hnnnnhghh."
,Recommended,410890,20469542,"Posted: 11 January, 2016",all,Yureina,"Between playing Onikakushi and this, I pretty much had dug into everything Higurashi I found. So unlike before I knew exactly what I was in for when I started playing the second arc of the series, Watanagashi. That foreknowledge still didn't ruin the experience though. If anything, it only heightened the sense of dread because I knew exactly how messed up this would turn out.Watanagashi introduces a new character, but also heavily involves the cast that you met before, with Mion in particular standing out. While much is similar to Onikakushi, much is different as well - particularly how things turn out in the end. Even so, if you have played the first chapter (and you should), then you have some idea where this is headed. Except... you don't.Annnd... I think that's all I will say because spoilers. But the gist of it is... I liked Watanagashi quite alot. More than Onikakushi, though that might just be because of my bias towards the ""answer arc"" for this, Meakashi, which is probably my favorite part of the entire series. Can't wait for that, or really the rest of the series to be honest. I hope they can release them faster. :oAnyway, if you have played Onikakushi... play this too. Right now. Then, when you are done, prepare yourself for what follows: Tatarigoroshi... and much more. o_oMy fingers hurt. :("

76561198085744382,Recommended,410890,30231572,Posted: 27 February,all,SNValadez,"Okay...So the reason I would recommend this game is because if you bought it and/or want to buy it that probably means you bought the first one and absolutely loved it (which I mostly and genuinely did) and that's really the only reason you should buy this game. Well, and if you want to finish the series, of course.But I warn you, this game is almost unforgivably fluffy. You know what I mean by fluffy? I mean it's full of fluff, not a whole lot of hard substance floating around in this one and that deeply saddened me.The beginning chapters are the absolute worst and as the name of this sequel(?) suggests, nothing of real value since the first game appears until you reach the Watanagashi festival. But when you sit through that chapter (which is chapter seven, in case you wanted to know), you feel a deeper understanding and meaning brought to the story and I just wish this second game didn't waste so, SO much time reintroducing characters we were already familiar with in the first game and force you to sit through such an agonizing (and somewhat unnecessary) teenage/pre-teen drama.My eyes! Here! Take them! Grr! Enough is enough! Where's the story that I loved so much from the first game?! It's in chapter seven. So what do I recommend?Well, if you really want to get to the meat of this particular game, get up to the part where you meet a mysterious (new?) character with green hair. She's dressed rather cutely. After your character has a decent exchange with that (new?) character skip to the end of chapter five. I'm not joking. Just skipping to this point may take you hours (well, maybe not if you have the auto settings on high) and make sure you stop skipping when you see two of something that you thought could not possibly coexist. Then skip to chapter six and don't stop skipping until you see pictures of a shrine and from there start reading to the end. You will meet some familiar faces. Then go to chapter seven and absolutely read all of that. I won't say whether or not to keep reading or skipping from there into the remaining chapters because that is up to you (but I tell you that the story is greatly improved and interesting from chapter seven on and I honestly could not stop reading unless hunger or nature called).So perhaps a better strategy would be to just start reading from chapter seven (and don't worry. I'm sure you'll figure out any details you might have missed in the early fluffy chapters).In either case, buy this game if you want to know more about the mysterious story behind the cries of the higurashi-- or don't because you can't be bothered with the tremendous amount of drag the beginning chapters offer.For me, it was really not a good idea to play this game right after the first. I probably should have let my mind simmer. You feel so ready and pumped and the writers basically send you back to kindergarten after all the knowledge you've gained. I really didn't like that. Or maybe I'm just too hard to please. Ha ha!P.S.I know I said I didn't condone fast-forwarding in my first review but in this second game I believe it's a must if you don't want to feel a relentless impatience for anything (absolutely ANYTHING) important to happen until chapter seven...just saying."

,Recommended,410890,23905735,"Posted: 28 June, 2016",all,Kimchi Tea,"Compared to Onikakushi (which works as a standalone story), Watanagashi is less about personal psychological horror and more about digging into the mystery of Hinamizawa. The ending on its own is unsatisfying, but taken as part of a series, it's clearly leading up to a reveal that will cast the events in a new light on a second reading. Avoid if you haven't read Onikakushi and/or don't intend on reading the rest of Higurashi, but otherwise recommended."

But the writing got a lot better on Watanagashi; you can actually feel the despair that MC feels.

If you loved Onikakushi (I know I did), then you're sure to love this one as well. If you haven't read through Onikakushi, go pick it up for a few dollars. Trust me, it's money well spent. Watanagashi gets into the mystery a little faster than Onikakushi did, since it doesn't have to establish characters as much as the first chapter did. However, there is a new character in this one, so still expect plenty of set-up before the madness begins. Also, the story this time around is a bit less mysterious. Onikakushi ended on a really weird note (trust me, this one does too), but having the knowledge from the first chapter really seems to make puzzle pieces fit a bit better. Overall, though, still plenty of mystery to go over, and you get a MUCH more detailed look into the past of Hinamiza. Trust me, it isn't pretty.The only negatives I can give this game are a few typos here and there, but with work this dense, that's always going to happen. It's not something a patch can't fix either!Oh, and in case you are new to this series and are on this page, Higurashi has no interaction when it comes to gameplay. I see so many people getting upset that it doesn't have branches, but honestly, there's so much mystery here that you're sure to play it through more than once! I know I am!

No one knows why this is…but it only happens each year after the event. Will you be able to find out who or what lead these tragic events?Graphics: 7/10The graphics are practically the same as the first novel, they have added nothing new here but that’s not to say that it looks any worse. It just looks exactly the same as the first novel. Although, there were a few different locations that were seen in this novel, but apart from that; the way the characters were drawn are the same.Storyline: 8/10Again, the story starts off very slow and gradually picks up around chapter 10. This time, the main culprit is actually shown and told in a very obvious manner (It’s pretty obvious once you get some ideas within the story). This ruined the mystery for me once I found out who the culprit was as the main character was still ‘not accepting’ the ‘person’, it got a little frustrating. Although, it is a still a great read, but I do prefer the first novel.Sound: 6/10Apart from a few different soundtracks here and there, it does borrow the same soundtrack heard from the first novel. They did not improve it in any way of form, but they also didn’t change it too drastically that it would mismatch the novel.Gameplay: 9/10Same deal with the first novel, you get the exact same options. In addition, there were no translation errors that I spotted which is a plus. However, as with the first novel the game crashed a few times, so make to save often to avoid losing progress.Price: 10/10With a base price of £5.59 it is worth significantly more than the first novel for nearly the same length. That’s not to say that this is not worth reading, this is a really good visual novel that is worth picking up if you want to read the 2nd chapter of the series."

Regardless, it's still an interesting, attention-grabbing and suspenseful story that's highly recommended to anyone who read the first chapter, has seen the anime or is a general horror fan (starting with Onikakushi is pretty much essential due to the way the story is structured)The story kept my attention throughout and has been practically marathoned as I wasn't able to stop until it was over.However, it did have a few flaws that impacted its enjoyment.I found a number of character actions, mainly of the narrating protagonist, to be unrealistic and highly irrational. I understand that emotion and impulse heavily affected his choices and motives, but some of the decisions he makes near the vn's end as well as ways in which he reacts to what's going on seemed highly unbelievable and far from what any human being would do, no matter the situation or their feelings towards others involved.Who in their right mind would show so much sympathy towards a recently revealed mass murderer and follow her into the secluded crime scene alone? Or go outside at night to meet her after she tried to torture them to death? If I was Keiichi, I would feel nothing but disgust and resentment towards Mion. The vague ""demon"" explanation for her actions didn't feel like enough to change my view of her as a character in this arc, and the concept of heartbreak caused by Rena being given the doll in no way justified her development as a character/sadistic murdererAnother issue I felt was present in this game, which was more apparent than in the first, was the repetitiveness of music at certain points, especially during longer scenes when the same track would loop many times despite my reasonably fast reading.Those points asside, I still highly recommend the game and appreciate the good translation as well as vastly improved character art."

If you dislike the new sprites, the game contains an option to use the original Sprites (which are hilarious yet endearing in their own way).I'm not sure at what speed MG intends to release Higurashi, but I hope they do so at a decent speed so we aren't waiting years to finish reading the Steam release.

The story feels larger this time. Also we get to know more aspects about the characters and the village Hinamizawa. As a fan of the anime adaptation, I enjoyed this chapter a lot, discovering all the minute but interesting details that were omitted in the anime.In summary:Pros:+The twins theme of Mion/Shion is brilliantly explored. Depending on the context, the writing is funny, entertatining, or horrifying. Also, the twins theme echos well with the duality theme of village Hinamizawa (the bright and dark sides of the village).+The pacing has been improved. The last chapter has a very slow and sometimes boring start, featuring numerous club activities that have little contribution to the main plot. Not this time. The main story starts rather early on. Also, the story progresses smoothly, compared to the last chapter.+New background music an better BGM switching.+Sound effects are utilized better.+Rena still rocks!Cons:-The reader will be introduced to the curse of Oyashiro-sama in a boring exposition... for the second time ... as if we hadn't got enough in the last chapter.-The thoughts of the protagonist are written in a really repetitive fashion.-Although this is chapter dedicated to the character Mion, I cannot find any new portraits for Mion (aside from Shion of course), which is really disappointed.Overall, I strongly recommend buying it at full price.

,Recommended,410890,20595196,"Posted: 17 January, 2016",all,MindfulOcean,"I was surprised when I played this game.  I was expecting either a prequel or a sequel to the first game but this is neither.  Each chapter in the Higurashi series tells the same story, with a number of subtle things changed around to yield different events and outcomes.  Apparently there are four such chapters, with those that come after explaining the mystery behind the previous stories.  So far, it seems like you could play the chapters in either order, but I suspect they will have more impact if you play them in the numbered order and that was probably the intention of the developer.Given how the series is set up, if you're reading this review and have played the first chapter already, you may be iffy about wanting to go through the same story again.  But although the characters and setting are the same, most of the minor events and major plot points are different, and it gives you more insight into what might be going on in the town.  In fact, it's different enough that it almost feels like someone wrote two different novels with the same premise, setting, and characters.  Only a few things stay the same, and I had no idea what was going to happen until it was all over, even though I had read the first chapter.If you've played the first chapter, buy this too.  If you haven't and are interested in the Higurashi series, start with the first one.In terms of the writing, I still think too much time is being spent on the cringe-worthy anime slice of life stuff.  I understand that it is needed to help us get invested in the characters and to contrast with the actual seriousness of the plot, but it is still very badly written.  I watch a lot of anime, and I've never seen slice of life writing that made me cringe as much as the stuff in Higurashi.  But maybe that is because of the story's main character?  His behavior at the end of the story is so unbelievable that it actually broke my immersion.  So maybe the school life stuff seems everything we see is from the point of view of the main character?Overall, it is a good visual novel and I recommend it highly.  If only the school life portions weren't so childish and ridiculous..."

Whether this admission is worthy of forgiveness is the main source of suspense.Mion (character)/character development--- Ch. 2 does a far better job at balancing setting establishment and character development in regards to its central character, who in this case is Mion. This is partly due to the village's history being integrated into her story rather than being a separate element as was the case with Rena in the previous chapter.NeutralPacing--- It's expected that the reader is familiar with the characters established in the first chapter, so this one takes less time to set the stage. However, some of the scenes in the first half come across as having been drawn out longer than necessary upon finishing this chapter.ConclusionThe reader knows what's coming, so there is less reason to hide the truth. Ch. 2 reels back the psychological horror element from Ch. 1 and becomes more of a slasher. The main character is not alone for this journey. During moments where he would have previously wrestled with his inner doubts on whether he could trust the friend standing beside him, this time he reaches out for help. Seeing it all unfold is only part of the excitement as the highlight of this chapter will come in the last few scenes when everything is thrown into question and the reader must struggle to make sense of what they actually experienced.Novel length is roughly9 hoursdepending on reading speed. It's recommended tobuy Higurashi Ch. 2after and only if you enjoyed Ch. 1."

,Recommended,410890,35265126,Posted: 28 September,all,Jack Traid,"Chapter 2 kept to the high standard that chapter 1 set, if not raising the standard altogether.Please note that this is the second chapter of a series, play through chapter 1 before this,What is it?Higurashi when they cry is a sound novel series. The games use sound effects, images, and appropriate music to generate an atmosphere for the story. This is done much better than the last game (Yse, I know it seems almost impossible) as they have added more music that really helps to get you immersed (Cheesy though this may sound). The key characters have sprites to help you get a better idea of their appearance, and their current mood. Images tend to be scenes so you can get the idea of where the character(s) is(are).StoryLike the last chapter this game has a brilliant story, however does not directly follow up from the last chapter, it is set over the same few days where a different chain of events occur instead.The story could be described as an emotional joyride for what kind of emotions your character feels (And that what it wants you too feel too) The character you play expresses himself in a manner of ways of goes through happiness, sorrow, hope, despair, regret, fear, feeling sympathetic towards the culprit, and what is almost love. (Though not in that order)Your character is still new to hinamizawa, however you have the knowledge of events from past chapters to take a different standpoint on events. After breaking a taboo of the village, people start to go missing, all of which had some connection to the chain of events leading up to your breaing of said taboo. Your character wants to find out what is happening, and, if possible, put a stop to it before anyone else you care about gets hurt.As said once before the idea of this game is to put you in the character's shoes, throughout the main story you shall see what he sees, hear what he hears, know what he thinks, and (dependant on your immersion) feel what he feels.The optional tips give you (The player) to learn more about the situation than your character.NOTE: This game follows a set path, there are no choices to be made.CostFor the experiance, I'd say this game is definately worth the cost (Much like the last game.) The playtime at the time I posted this was around 16.7 hours. So in my books, chapter 2 is worth the cost as much as chapter 1 was.After PartyAfter you have completed the game, you unlock the ""After Party"". This is also titled as the ""All cast review session"". In it, the characters break down the 4th wall and share their opinions on the game, and their theories behind the inccidents, also discussing what the beta players thought. (A surprisingly nice way to end the game, as it somewhat doubles up as a brief recap.) It also makes some hints at preperations for the third chapter (For which I also have high expectations for.)This game, as said above, was great. I just fell into the world they were trying to portray, even after seeing the anime, some elements of the game surprised me. (There are differences between the anime and games.)Why are you still reading this? Haven't you bought this chapter already?"
,Recommended,410890,23786462,"Posted: 25 June, 2016",all,strayseer,"Although Watanagashi can be played first or even as a stand-alone novel (much of the information revealed in Onikakushi is presented here as well), this is a comparative review. So, to lay out the pros and cons in relation to Ch1:Pros (aka. the reason why I do recommend this):- The beginning doesn't feel as slow, and it's also a little more entertaining.- You get to understand some characters' intentions a little better (I'm looking at you, Ooishi).- The sound during creepy/suspense moments is soooo much better.- More of the history of Hinamizawa.- In case you like Mion as much as I do, you get to see plenty of her backstory here as well.Cons (aka. critique time! May be a little long and spoilery, so be warned):- It feels like this had a ""broader""/more general point of view, focusing on what's going on with everybody and having Keiichi try to find out what happened to other people in these larger-scale incidents, making this more about mystery than psychological horror. Onikakushi, on the other hand, focused on both Rena's and Keiichi's mental breakdowns. The narrative had you at the edge of your seat much more often than Watanagashi. After all, itdoeshave a bigger impact when you read first-person descriptions of somebody stalking and trying to kill you than when you read a character talking about some other people who died.- Keiichi's character in this also made the end really lukewarm, in my opinion. His unconditional acceptance and near-blind trust in Mion made the horrible things at the end seem much more distant than his constant paranoia and fear of Rena (his development in both chapters is understandable, however).- The emphasis on gender roles and stereotypes for the first half of the game is SO ANNOYING.Also, a little tip: you may think the ""after party"" is just a little extra, but I do recommend reading it. Characters get together as if they were actors just playing their roles and discuss the story, which may help you mull it over as well. I admit I had found the end to be incredibly underwhelming (especially in comparison to Onikakushi), but the after party shed light on some things I hadn't considered. I guess the generic writing at the start of each chapter really had me underestimating the writers..."

Pick it up as a series though: don't start with Chapter 2, start with Chapter 1, which can be found[here on Steam], if anybodies interested.In a bit more detail:Whilst keep in mind that I'm only as familiar with Higurashi as far as the remade chapters are, as I never played the original VN, read the manga, and have only watched 2 arcs of the show too long ago for me to remember, at this stage I'm willing to call Higurashia marvel of storytelling- and I like to think I'm pretty picky, as a few people I've probably annoyed could attest.As a series so far, the 'progressive mystery storytelling' I want to say, as dumb and questionable-english-teacher as it probably sounds, is nothing short of sensational. Onikakushi provided something of a more narrow context to what's going on in Higurashi, with the author having known full well that it was the first installment and written as such, whilst Watanagashi has offered something much broader with even a little bit of closure this time. Much like how I mentioned Onikakushi was written like the first installment, Watanagashi was written as a sequel, and it does an amazing job at that: the first half of the chapter, whilst being cheerful and bright much like Onikakushi's first half, this time is littered with ambiguous little statements which are easily understood with knowledge of the events of Onikakushi that are difficult to tell apart as genuine hints or red herrings; additionaly, the first half of the story took a, series considered, interesting approach to keeping it interested and tossing about your feelings, all of which then had very serious and useful implications in the later half which I wont even begin to go into. The second half of the story was bloody sensational: whilst Onikakushi was all about having you feel genuine terror and really driving the mystery and reality of it all home, Watanagashi expanded on what was going on and felt more like a murder mystery than the raw psychological horror Onikakushi was - although it's still defiantly something of a psychological horror, so don't chill out just yet - it was done in such a way that really nicely expanded on what was revealed in Onikakushi; I'd probably just ramble if I went into detail like i probably am already, but a good summary is 'progressive mystery storytelling' done really well.The overall conclusion of the chapter is another topic alltogether. With what I have information-wise on the story so far, it was executed incredibly well.As far as the additions with the remakes go,whilst restricted primarily to the translation and new sprites, they're both amazing. I spot all of 1 typo when when I was playing through which is probably already patched anyway, and the new spirtes can be... quite frankly, terrifying. If you played Onikakushi, I'm fairly sure you know what I mean. ;-;My only real gripeswith Watanagashi and Higurashi so far really is that a few of the pieces from the soundtrack - specifically, 'Fascism' and sort of 'Dawn''s harmony line - and the UI.The pieces I mentioned had 2005 .midi-tier horns shamelessly blaring that put Touhou's to shame. Even with Higurashi turned kinda down like I do with most games, it was loud enough to mess with my earbuds - albiet, cheap earburds - a bit, and generally weren't that great a choice and even a bit cringe-inducing as far as texture and, overall choice, really. That being said though, Higurashi does also feature 'Gear' which is an excellent piece in itself which I'd be almost willing to say makes up for that.As far as the UI goes, I found it a little bit jarring when I came into Onikakushi, but was pretty chill with it by the time I got to Watanagashi. It's for this reason alone I said to have played 2 VN's earlier in the review: I came in off 98% on Katawa Shoujo and 100% on Fate/stay night and the UI was initially a bit of a turn off, to be a bit blunt. Playing through the VN's, though, the major quality of the content is defiantly worth the minor subjective turn off that's the UI, so it's entirely made up for and more, and Dawn featured an excellent piano melody line that sort of makes the .midi horn harmony line partly worth it.So yeah, that's really all from me.The short version is really my summary that'd I'd normally put here. If you've read this far though, you've probably watched the anime, haven't you?I'll get there one day... when I get masculine enough to endure that one 'manicure' scene... ;A;A bit of an observation from me on the next chapter's release, I guess:Onikakushi was released on the 16th of May 2015, and Watanagashi was released on the 14th of November 2015, which might suggest an approximate 6-8 month wait for the next chapter? Sometime around May to July 2016?"

,Not Recommended,410890,28337223,"Posted: 12 December, 2016",all,☂,"If you enjoyed Chapter 1 of Higurashi, you'll likely enjoy Chapter 2. This review is for those who are reluctant to continue after Chapter 1.I found the first chapter of Higurashi to be an overall great experience. The suspense and horror parts were written well enough to make them genuinely frightening and engaging, making up for the less interesting expository moments. The horror is still good in Chapter 2, though I found it to be less vivid and inspired than Chapter 1. The first chapter, even in its less believable parts, made an effort to put the player in the main character's perspective and managed to be fairly successful at it. Perhaps because several elements of Chapter 1 are reused, Chapter 2 feels less exciting and engrossing. The end also feels much longer than it needs to be, with several anti-climaxes making the ultimate turn of events less thrilling and more depressing.The bigger problem this chapter suffers from is in the exposition. Whereas the build-up in Chapter 1 made the slow introduction worthwhile, Chapter 2 doubles down on the less appealing parts. The club activities are still drawn out and repetitive, and much of the first few hours feels like filler. Furthermore, the treatment of the female characters is abysmal, with even the youngest characters being treated like sex objects at times. It gives the entire first half of the game a very unpleasant atmosphere. While I realize this is an anime game from 2002, I'd really rather not read in detail about a perverted restaurant-goer attempting to get the attractive waiting staff to clean whipped cream off of his crotch. The game as a whole feels more fanservice-y than the first and detracts from the character interactions and plot.As mentioned at the start of the review, if you loved Chapter 1, you'll still probably enjoy this chapter, but I found it to be much weaker overall."

It is more expensive, however the price is completely justified by the content.If you enjoyed the first chapter, then you will enjoy this one as well. However, if you have not read the first chapter, then you will not fully appreciate this.However, there are a few important things to know about this particular chapter before deciding to purchase it.- It is not strictly a sequel, rather it retells the events of the first game but diverges to tell a different story with different events and in the process, it clears up a few games about the first game- It still provides few ""answers"" as it is its own story and raises its own set of questions to be answered in later chaptersLike the first chapter, there are still a few flaws present in the game- It still raises more questions about the last chapter than it answers- The game's refrences to pop culture do not fit with the time the game takes place in: why are they refrencing Kindaichi when it ran long after the time the story takes place?- A few spelling and grammar mistakes- It's still hard to tell who is speaking at what time as the text can all roll together at times"

I highly recommend playing Wataganashi with headphones in the dark to keep things extra spooky.  Also, just like the first chapter, the soundtrack is pretty rad and sets the tone perfectly for each scene.  I urge anyone with the slightest interest in this series to give it a whirl. You won't be disappointed."

,Recommended,410890,26426083,"Posted: 4 November, 2016",all,Rizzy,"First up: This a a kinetic or sound novel. That means that it is more like a book with pictures, music and character sprites to illustrate and accompany the story. Unlike many other visual novels, this one does not feature any choices or different endings.If that sounds to your liking and this is your first contact with Higurashi: DO NOT LOOK AT THE GAMES TRADING CARDS OR ACHIEVEMNTS! They contain spoilers. Especially the Trading Cards descriptions. Oh, and play Onikakushi before you play this.Actual review: While I would definitely recommend Higurashi Ch. 2 to anyone, who is not turned away by this review's first paragraph, I feel that Ch.1 was a bit better. Watanagshi still delivers the promised horror, spine-tingly goose bumps and murder/conspiracy mistery. And towards the end it gets very, very dark!- pacing is not as good as Onikakushi's- one of the new music tracks seems to be of lower quality than the others- said track plays during one of the big reveals and was utterly unfitting- sometimes,  character sprites seemed to have the wrong facial expressions, also why aren't the ones with the different eyes from Onikakushi used?+ starts with a minor mistery, that actually had me thinking all the way through: is S really S and is M really M?+ some great plot twists+ Detective Rena is absolutely badass adorable!+ Holy crap did the ending scare me!Since I'm having a really hard time writing anything more without spoilers, I'll keep it at that and hope you will have as much fun as I did with this visual novel. I'm already looking forward to Ch.3.""Huh...... hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee ...

,Recommended,410890,23360867,"Posted: 3 June, 2016",all,MrXboxdylan,"I really loved this chapter and it literally exceeded the last chapter in nearly every possible way (Rena best girl though). This chapter felt like the pacing was perfect and when I watched the anime I never realised how much they truly missed in the games but trust me if you're playing the games first time round there's a lot the anime didn't touch including really important parts. This is really a character-defining arc and it's really horrorific and tragic. You really feel for the characters and it's truly sad what happened. This arc is full of a bit of both worlds. Horror and comedy, not really two genres that mix but somehow higurashi does this to perfection. The only thing that could really make the game better is voice acting but even without you still get enough sounds through cicadas and well-placed music. (Would take this game home if it had physical releases). 9/10, recommend any avid higurashi fans of the anime or manga to give this a try (given you've played the first chapter)."

In this Higurashi chapter u focus more on the mystery's of Hinamizawa.Prepaired to get creeped out when the game starts to get into the creepy parts. One part in particular scared me. But I knew it was going to happen because I saw a walkthrough of this. In my opinion the new art was creepier than the other one I saw.One thing I do want to say I wanted to slap Kei-chan soooooooo hard on the face. I won't go into details to avoid spoilers. But man some of the decisions he made where just stupid as heck:(All in all beside Kei-Chan making dumb decisions this chapter was a lot of fun to play:)

,Recommended,410890,29214849,Posted: 12 January,all,DiMenezes,"Wow , what a ride. Like the first chapter, Watanahashi puts you in the role a Maebare Keichi, a normal high school student who moved to the small town of Hinamizawa in the year of 1983.Life starts in an everyday school life where and you and your friends have fun doing fun activities with your friends. That is until some mysteries about the village you are living in star to unveil and soon enough you are tangled in a mess of a situation.So, about the story of the game, there’s not much to say without spoiling the experience but  I’ll say right now that after a slow start it gets amazingly fun! Without giving anything away I’ll at least add the genre of the story and while it’s obvious of what it is all he time, it would be something like slice of life in the beginning and after that a mix of mystery and horror.About graphics and all there isn’t much to say about it as it is a visual novel but I think it’s worth to mention that using a graphics and audio patch are a must for fully enjoying it. The standard graphics of the game are in my opinion horrible but thankfully with the patch you can use the Playstation 3 version of the graphics that are quite an upgrade and those in my opinion look great.I think I noticed a few new songs for this chapter and they were good but once again if I have one complain about the soundtrack is the same I had for the first game, one of the songs that plays when you are doing daily stuff.Overall this was a great chapter in the Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni series of visual novels. I took me 16 hours to play through all of it and I loved it from beginning to end.Observation: For those interested I’d like to add a small comparison to the first chapter. Without spoiling anything while I thought the story was better in chapter 2, in the first one it was much creepier. There was times in chapter one I got actually scared and while it didn’t happen with the same itensity in chapter 2 the story and the new information you discover about the village are much more interesting.Overall, I think both chapters are equally good but a bit different.The Pros and Cons of the game for me stay the same from the firstPros:Great story, interesting mystery and captivating.Visual are very pretty (with the fanmade patch)Voice acting adds to the exprience (again, with the fanmade patch)Music helps set the mood, especially in the more spooky moments.Cons:Slow start but not as slow as the first chapter.One particular track of the OST I don’t like but it’s beginning to grow on me."
