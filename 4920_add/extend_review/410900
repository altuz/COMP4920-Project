,Recommended,410900,31234962,Posted: 19 April,all,Destructively Phased,"To clarify, I got access to the private Beta back in September for free. I'm going to buy this now as the key for it was removed from my account but I can say the content I experienced back then has made me want to try more.So where to begin with Forts? I'd say it strikes me as a cross between bridge building simulators, Worms, and... it's own unique thing. That holds up only if your bridge building simulator has someone firing a laser at your design while your building it and you play worms by sitting still against someone who also sits still...So to clarify, it strikes me as ""Worm-like"" with its projectile system, 2D plane map, it's aesthetic and range of weapons which all feel pretty much unique. The bridge simulator part comes in with the the whole ""build your own fort"" as there is stresses involved and the thing can swing ever so precariously. To the point that sticking heavy armour onto the top of your fort can seem like a good idea to stop mortar blasts but with caveat that if anything blasts the lower part of your base you're going over.The combat is fun, as your doing it around building your own base, and the early dash to see how much early damage you can do to the enemy fort is brilliant, as every little piece destroyed feels like a minor victory. Later on playing defence against incoming mortars and missiles can get dull, as your playing ""point defence simulator"" which sounds dull, but again, it leads into the fast combat that Forts is inevitably about. This all pays off when you get to the late stages of a match where it comes down to ""who got the mega weapon first"". Not so much fun being on the losing side, but I hope that's been changed since beta so there's a little counter play. But it sure is hell fun to hit the enemy base with a cannon and see their laser go up in smoke... better luck next time developers. (Though I did set them back by sniping theirs off... should mention that. Still teaches them to not not use armoured doors to save costs.)And the tension as to who can get their top tier weapon built first generally carries the whole experience as there is always the chance that the enemy miss their shots and you can pull it back...All in all, Forts is a brilliant game to play and have fun with. The campaign was meh when I tried it (it may have changed since September/October), but the multiplayer is where it's at.Plugging my own youtube channel and some game play footage to help with choosing whether or not to buy:https://youtu.be/tt4_l8kCilwhttps://youtu.be/VkFZoxAdamg"
76561198012269695,Recommended,410900,31249275,Posted: 19 April,all,Aletx,"This game is essentially a RTS hybrid of Worm + Polybridge.In terms of Gameplay, you have to plan/build your fort, manage your resource/tech, and destroy opposing fort while keep yours standing. You have to accomplish all that in real time, and it can feel a bit overwhelming at first. However, once you overcome the learning curve, the game is without a doubt fun and addictive.There is a single player campaign/ skirmish, but the selling point of the game is the multiplayer aspect. There are map scenarios where a team of players control a fort, which involved great deal of communication and teamwork. Alternatively, there are also maps where individual player control their own fort for less ""chaotic"" teamplay.Pros:-High replayability potential- Each match feels very different, simply because the style and design of forts you see from other players are highly divese and creative. There is already a map editor build in the game, so expected new map creation in the future.-Easy to play, difficult to master- To build a decent fort, you need good physics building. To manage your fort efficiently, you need good multitasking skill. To kill enemy fort, you need good aiming/ geometry, as well as good awareness to keep track of what enemy fort is planning. This makes the gameplay feels rich and satisfying.Cons:-Atrocious multiplayer lobby ui- The game lacks match filter. Currently, you will see a list of match, but you will not know whether that game is in progress or waiting for players to join. Finding a match is extremely tedious, with lots of joining/leaving.-Network/ Technical issues- Although the game is playable, ping issues and random disconnect do occur. Hopefully this issue is addressed in later patches.-Questionable campaign dialogue- If your sense of humor is not tolerable, the references may rub certain people off in a wrong way. Though this is more of a nickpicking critique.Verdict:Should you get the game? Absolutly.The gameplay is both rich and satisfying. It is like playing polybridge with guns, except you get to smash other's bridge/fort.There are some technical and ui issues, but that's expected in any titles at launch.Did I mention this is an indie game? And it is only made by a small team of 3 devs?"
,Not Recommended,410900,31650990,Posted: 9 May,all,NecroCloakDozer,"At heart it can be a fun game, but the devs do not describe it accurately, 'tech tree' normally means branching options, various ways to build, in this, it is tech twig, and slightly taller tech twig, the campaign gets downright impossible near the end, with the AI managing to build five things at once, and not needing to do the extra steps you do, it isn't good difficulty, to just make the AI Unbeatable. Skirmishes could be fun, but you'd need friends to play it with, or do online multiplayer, either one is just a race to see who gets to a final tier weapon first, or manages to out-mortar the other player. I love the game, and the idea, it needs work, but it is a complete mess right now. Lack of autofire also sucks, it would be great to just set the mortars to fire constantly, as soon as they get reloaded."
,Recommended,410900,31495064,Posted: 1 May,all,TheDankness,"To start off, Forts is a very fun game with a great worms/basebuilding genre feel.The core of the game is pretty much top notch already, Physics are great, AI are quite the challenge (Sometimes a tad too predictable though). Weapons that are in the game are very cool and have quite good variety for teh alpha stages of this game.At this the moment in time i feel like the price range is a bit steep for the amount of content however, the reason i purchased this game was because i have faith in the Devs and the fact that they will keep the game updated and add more and more content and by just looking at the reviews and seeing that the Devs are actively replying to the customers queries gives me a great deal of hope for the future of this game.Maybe a little bit of constructive criticism to take on board here, but at this moment in time it kind of feels like its a rush to higher level equipment due to the fact there are not all too many reliable counters to weapons like the cannon and lazer. However im very sure this issue will be simpily fixed in the future by the addition of more content like more towers, defences and upgrade routes.I have high hopes for this little game and wish good luck to the Devs."
,Recommended,410900,31271667,Posted: 21 April,all,Defiant Heretic,"Very interesting ... RTS?Well, for lack of a content I wouldn't go that way calling it RTS as many players understand this word. On other side it is strategy and it's in realtime. Pretty nice gameplay; smart AI, oh the AI is freakin smart and can be annoying as hell. I just tried campaign on hard a bit and then I wanted to try multiplayer. It needs a tweaking really and open lobbies are not working properly now. On many levels it feels like advanced beta build as the updates and repaires are promised. Also it needs more variety in weapon and material department...Nevertheless, the game is playable, enjoyable and it's focusing on two most favorite humankind out-of-bed activity: building and destroying. What more do you want?+ Graphic; cartonish but very well executed and working for me within the theme and enviroment++ Satisfaction when your long build and preparation results in a superb shot against the enemy fort, posibbly crumble their own weaponry+ Interesting and various maps to play on+ Finally good AI to play against (you can go various dificulties: easy, normal, hard)+ 9 commanders. They change many things (repairs time, prices of materials, reload time, dmg,...) and you choose one for your style of gameplay+ Humour and sarcasm in campaign (some comments and nods on world's politics :D)+ Physics. Behaviour of fort stability and weapon's shots. Very nice detail.+ Skill shots. Most weapons you have to aim yourself and that takes some time to learn. I would suggest to go a first few rounds against AI before stepping into the multiplayer+ Build race against enemy fort, AI or player. Pressure on your decisions. Would you go rush and build straigh forward machinery or save resources for advanced weapons?+- Multitasking with your machines guns defending you from mortar or missiles and firing your own weapons could get pretty hectic (automatic defense is preferable in my view, try to tick the option before the match)+- This game cries multiplayer and yet there are some birth issues with the full release (game had closed beta and quite a few streamers) + player base is not that vast to be excited about- Only a few weapons, materials - variety in general; I expect game to get repetive after a while if not played with premade multiplayer. More feature required ASAP.- I somehow remember playing something very similar in browser flash game6,5/10""At this point an enjoyable game with the many maps, decent campaign and a promise of great multiplayer experience"

I dont care that the physics arent real world physics it's still fun.Some concepts like the armor slant are great but some objects like shields feel utterly useless as all they do is block your turrets from firing and do nothing but expload when attacked. You think the shield generator would be more useful and let your turrets shoot through it but not enemy turrets or something. Really feels like a useless addition ot the base.The AI has been reworked giving the player more of a learning experiance, Where as the ""Easy"" AI back at release used to feel like it was on hard or normal mode. This was patched. The Easy AI is slow, Normal AI is normal, hard is hard. Wether or not the AI still ""aimbots"" because well, Almost all AI is practically blind in the literal sense, I dont know. But I do know it was reworked to be less frustratingIt's overall pretty fun and a neat concept.(if you're reading this review after the edit note that the developer response was from a pre-edit when I said the AI was abysmally bad and just absolutely ridiculous to fight)"

If you remember 'Worms' or played 'Angry Birds' it's like those but better, with more depth and complexity. If you liked either of those, this is the game for you.The pros:- It is fun and addictive- Games can be quick- it has enough complexity to keep you engaged and trying to improve- Very replayable (especially if you play multiplayer)- Freedom to choose and develop your own strategyThe cons:- There is a bit of micromanagement required to fire weapons,- Apart from this nothing really.It is worth it at the price."

,Not Recommended,410900,31271724,Posted: 21 April,all,Digital,"A cute game with solid potential, but the fun dies about time the one-shot-kill cannons show up.  The game simply becomes a rush to that specific tech and then done.Additionally, there's a great deal of micro to keep weapons firing to keep the enemy busy while you build.  Auto-repeat firing weapons might help with that, but as it stands that takes a bit away as well.Certainly not a bad game, but since ""may be good for some people, not really for me"" isn't an option, I have to say I can't recommend it personally."
,Recommended,410900,33787529,Posted: 25 July,all,Banelings,"Holy mother of base-building!This game has got me completely hooked, and I'm warning you, if you enjoy the hectic nature of RTS games paired up with classic Worms-style combat, Forts is going to be your wet dream for the night.We've got machine guns, snipers, mortars, swarm missiles, heavy-duty cannons, and freaking lazer beams! We've got resource management, clever construction mechanics, and nuclear reactors.Do you want to pepper your enemies with gatling guns that set fire to everything they love and cherish? You can do that!Do you want to rush the big toys and surprise your opponent by surgically removing his fort from the very cliffside he's anchored to with a giant lazer? You can do that!Do you want to go head to head with a single opponent to determine which one is the better tactical mastermind? Or would you rather pair up with a bunch of madmen and join an all-out brawl in a 4-vs-4 firefight to the death? How about multiple players controlling the same fort? You man the guns, I'll get that economy up and running!You can also choose to play with Commanders, which bring different bonuses and unique abilities to the table, allowing you to fine-tune your strategy and catch your opponents off guard. There are 9 commanders available, each one with a different passive and active ability.There is a campaign that serves as a tutorial of sorts, which is filled with fun snippets and comments from the npcs. Where the game truly shines, though, is in multiplayer. It is fast-paced and fun as all hell. Even though the playerbase isn't the largest right now, I have never had the problem of not finding people to join. This afternoon I even had one of the developers join my lobby, and I got to chat with him on discord for a few hours. These people have done an outstanding job, and I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone and everyone! The sound design is amazing, every explosion feels impactful, and there are enough audio queues to let the attentive players know what's going on around the map without having to pan over and have a look. The artstyle is simple, elegant, and funny. It fits the tone of the game and really let's you know not to take a loss too hard or a win too seriously.Forts is a game for people who like fun. And fun is definitely allowed!So a quick Pros/Cons summaryPROS:-Intense and wild gameplay-Dynamic gameplay with tons of different viable strategies-Amazing multiplayer-Great music and sound-Great artwork-No bugs (as far as I know)-Really cool developers, cheers!CONS:-You have to use third-party clients for voice chat, Discord, Teamspeak, etc (not really much of a con)-Simple scroll-through hotkey system. I'd love to see a more advanced hotkey setup in the future.Forts gets 10 big, fat thumbs straight up from me! Now, what are you waiting for, buy the damn thing and fight me!"

76561198072128905,Recommended,410900,31392840,Posted: 27 April,all,vanasten1,"Forts is a strategic game about destroying the enemy base before they destroy you.There are currently 6 different guns you can use, 4 of which can be upgraded.The main challenge is getting a good energy and metal income to build weapons, while also defending these generators and your main reactor.Probably the main draw is the multiplayer. The campaign provides some challenge but isn't the main draw. That would be the multiplayer.It's a great game if you have friends to play it with. Or if your like me and don't have any, the discord server has plenty of guys to play with.Oh, and it has a Kickass soundtrack.The only negative I really have with the game is the lack of effective weapons. The problem isnt the number in the game, its that rushing to get the big guns often is more effective then building smaller guns. However, these sorts of problems are to be expected from an indi-development team.Overall, a great game to play, especially when they add workshop and mod support."
,Recommended,410900,31237080,Posted: 19 April,all,TinBane,"Build a fort.Use different materials and objects.Fill it with weapons.Use it in pitched battle against another fort.There's a good mix of skill shots, timing challenges, risk vs reward, and investing for income vs investing to achieve the goal.

The game is just starting out and it is bringing a lot of updates and it has very caring devs. Graphics are very nice, the game could easily be ported to a phone and run great, the gameplay might be a bit repetetive, but it is always fresh, because of the variety of ways you could play in.

,Not Recommended,410900,31671102,Posted: 10 May,all,SirManBeard,"Currently I cant recommend this gameTLDR: Same strat every game, Rush cannon or laser and whoever gets there first basically can win. If i make one slip with building from the start its almost a guarantee loss. If im point i win. Seems that there is not much strategy but just a grind on one path. Only other option is possibly making warheads but that is much less likely. Devs do listen and respond to players so that is a plus!Pros+Custom Building+Physics based construction+Cool interactions with weapons on Armor/Shielding+BURN BABY BURNCons-Basically the same strat every game, Rush cannons or Lasers-You Slip up you lose-Grind to top Teir (Tech Tree is not a tree)-Basically Tech goes base unit and 1 upgrade, So machine gun-Gattling gun. Sniper to uber sniper. Mortar-Heavy Mortar. Rocket swarm - Mini Nuke. And teir 3's dont have upgrades.-ends up with little diversity with weapons.-Some interactions don't make sense. (An Upgraded Sniper can penetrate a layer of armor but can fly through 2 shields.)-Buggy/Laggy-Player base is Small (Only can play laggy games because of distance)-If you are new you get wrecked-Unless you grind a specific Strat you loseI definitely think this can be a great game but most people will get on, Get F***ed and quit cause of the boring strats.I've Won and last games so this isn't coming from a losing perspective.

Strategy wise there is a lot of Rts potential, balance economy with weapons, what weapons to build/counter, combined with building and shooting element it's a lot of fun. Though the more you play it, the more you feel the sheer lack in possiblities. The six towers aren't enough, the upgrade route is the same every game, and it occasionally just feels like a grind until you finally get to the top tier weapons. The game simply needs much more meat. More tech routes, more variability in builds, its really just too much of the same. I hope the devs will add it, and no, two more towers won't do it, if you want to breathe life into this wonderful shell of a game, you'll need to give it a heart."

I certainly did. Well this game is that on a computer against real human opponents. It is a solid party style game reminiscent of both children's pencil drawn paper battles and lego build and destruction.The game is very fun and well worth the money at its current price point of $15.

,Recommended,410900,31239428,Posted: 19 April,all,Nova Nihil,"Fort building with structural integrity.Weapon placement has to be strategic, got to be able to shoot where you want to and but you have to be able to defend as well.  Machine gun nests will auto-fire on incoming mortar, but if you upgrade them their cone of fire is greatly reduced so they become fully offensive weapons.  Guns cost resources to fire, and you have to aim them.  There are pros and cons to every weapon emplacement.  Think ahead while building your base if you want to make a rocket pod, they shoot upwards and need to be placed inside a foundation.Resource management:  you have to collect metal and use wind turbines for power.  Wind turbines have to be high up and exposed to produce good ammounts of energy, but it makes them prime targets so you have to think ahead.This game is so simple yet so complex and all the parts work so well.  I highly recommend it!"

I haven't played any of the multiplayer yet, but once i've finished the campaign I will be right over. I like getting to construct your base however you want (mine always collapse though) and trying to figure out the best layout for a defensive and offensive setup. I wish there were a few more weapons available, but the weapons available are cool. Can't wait for some of my friends to get this as well so we can settle a few feuds :P."

Expect to have a learning curve of 1 - 2 hours until you can hold your ground in a multiplayer game.There's a great campaign to guide you along the way which is quite fun to play but the meat of the game to me is in the Multiplayer. You can play up to 4v4 with shared or separate control (as in everyone controls one fort) and that's where the game really starts to shine as you have a couple different approaches to everything and counters to them as well. There's nothing more satisfying than taking down that pesky fort that you have hammered for quite some time now with a surprise attack the enemy didnt see coming. Coordinating your attacks and outplaying your oponents defenses is very very rewarding as you can't turtle forever, at some point you have to bring the fight to your oponents.Top that off with a simple but great physics engine that limits you in the way you can build. You can slant armor so bullets just ricochet off but now you're giving a prime target for mortars, so what is it going to be commander ?The game is not perfect yet however, some things especially in the multiplayer lobby need explaining (AI Settings, separate commanders for teammates, more info on maps), more varied Maps for 2v2 / 3v3 / 4v4. But as of now you can expect to have a blast regardless if you're not to serious. (There's no ranked system yet)There are people who complain about the content, i feel thats not fair as the content comes mainly through what you do with the tools at your disposal, i'm not sure the game needs more weapons as you already have a ton of ways to use them in conjunction to how your build your base etc.A specific feedback to the devs is also about the machineguns, give us an option to deactivate their automatic fire, but avoid introducing mechanics that one can only figure out when he researches them: that machineguns stop firing above a certain height is unintuitive and not good for whatever reason you implemented it.Another thing is to take the ""E"" hotkey into the tutorial, it's the single most important thing in multiplayer as you can use your control groups without looking at them and aiming all over again. People who played the game certainly agree with me there.9/10"

It's like one part Angry Birds and two parts Terraria. You build structures and defend them with machine guns, snipers, mortars, cannons, and lasers. You can play by yourself, or you can play as part of a team. Better yet, you can jointly control one side of the battlefield. These features give the game a very strong cooperative and multiplayer system. The AI has also been updated to accomodate multiple reactors and automate some forms of defense. The AI has multiple difficulty levels and keeps pace with humans. Maps are also well varied with forts built upward, sidewas, or downward -- good range of challenges!It's a bit repetitive and lacks variety in gameplay.

The physics also add a level of danger to the game as you sometimes have to hussle to ensure a sound stable structure. This in turn can lead to other mistakes; struts that look safe blocking your ability to place new guns.I haven't yet played the multiplayer portion of the game but the single player campaign has an actual story to it rather than you just going from one level to another with the story holding some comedy without becoming campy. On the downside, in my short time playing, I've already had the game crash on me twice which calls a stability issue into question and a fear that going into multiplayer maps this could happen as well, losing you a match due to the game giving up on you. However I still really enjoyed the game and it seems like a game that you can pick up, play a few matches and then leave for work or school making it a nice time waster. The music is fun, cartoony like the rest of the game while the other sounds are likewisein the ature of the rest of the game's design and style.Overall I still recommend the game and I will also be buying the soundtrack soon but I hope that the game will cease crashing, perhaps I'll find a way of doing that on a forum, but other than that please do buy this game; I believe it deserves your money and time."

Within two hours you can basically try out all of the different weapons and such.As with all Early Access games, this is an investment.

The plot is not too wild but gets a nice twist in the end, the dialogue though not voiced (just the monolog of the reporter) makes me smile (though you would have to play on english for that, the german translation ... seems to want to more translate than get the joke).the skirmish AI could need higher difficulties; for beginners they are fine but I got 40h of playtime now and I can annihalate the hardest AI before it gets to build Tier3 weapons. Not on all maps though, on some the AI behaves challenging.Multiplayer has its starting issues as - again - to be expected but it is beeing worked on and is not as fatal as bigger games manage to. The mapamount I would like to see increased, yeah, there is modsupport and an integrated mapediting but that I first gotta figure out on how to use, but for split bases for each team there are currently just 2 maps.Other things that I am hoping will be added to the game I am going to post into the games discussion forums - the devs actually reply, great kudos to that!"

Team modes allow for multiple forts or (on smaller maps) all players on a team simultaneously managing a single fort.Not a huge variety of weapons, though - but I don't think that necessarily takes away from the game. Games usually end very quickly once someone gets to the high-tier weapons ... not much you can do to defend against the laser cannon.Concerned that some of the Commanders might be imbalanced. The Eagle Eye commander in particular, with his active ability to make all rounds explosive temporarily, seems a bit much. Time will tell, though.Technicals:- lag can be an issue. If there is a nasty spike, you'll find yourself basically unable to interract with the game at all until it subsides.- appears to be an issue with players joining a match while it's going. sometimes causes players playing the game to be booted. This can be avoided if the host makes sure to lock the lobby before launching (or just not allowing any spaces for spectators)."

One of my favorite older style games has been finally brought back to life.Though, there are major problems with the game. First, the stability (performance) is very unstable, the game crashess every 3-4 matches, with prevelant lag spikes. Secondly, I love the map editor idea. The option for all players to bring their ideas to life and use their very own maps in online matches is fantastic. However, the map editor system currently in place is hopelessly useless and bugged. If a new UI can be created for this function in the game and the bugs worked out, this is surely to be an amazing feature."

There is a map editor but it is painfully dificult to use and very counter intuitive. That is the biggest flaw i see, if the map editor was easier to use and the community could make more maps this game would be much better. The random crashes don't help either."

But then designed into the levels are areas in which it is PAINFUL to constantly click group 1, all fire, group 2, all fire, group 3, all fire, 6 keys to fire.. etcI feel artificial difficulty has been added and in the worst way possible, where I could be having fun I am putting attention into just firing weapons.  Furthermore double-clicking a control group(because you can't autofire and if you want to laydown fire you'll be mashing keys) brings your focus to them, which in this game is pointless.The only suggestions I have to offer is add an a option to auto-fire or group more than 3 for single player only.Pros:Nice graphics, cool world, cool idea, a community involved devCons:No autofire, max of 3 weapons in a group, artificial difficulty with micromanagement.I would give this game 8/10 but I don’t recommend (I really want too but it is too frustrating)."

One of the major problems I have is that in order to fire a weapon you have to keep your mouse in a very small area depicting the firing arc. For instance, if you have a machine gun, you have to keep your mouse in a maybe 2 inch wide square in order to fire. If you move outside of that for any reason (like trying to line up a shot by placing your mouse over it) you move the screen instead of shooting.What this means is that when I'm trying to aim at a mortar coming in or something I have to keep a very careful eye on where my mouse is in that box, otherwise I'll just drag the screen around and let the mortar hit. I'm not sure if this was an intentional flaw, to try and make precise aiming more difficult (since most artillary games aim by adjusting angle and power instead of just point and click) but it makes even doing the simple act of firing a needless chore.I played all of 6 levels before I just gave up on it because of this."

I cant focus on building, i cant focus on aiming, i cant use my resources, I cant upgrade anything, I cant play the game because I'm glued to my turrets trying to pop these enemy shots from the air. And if i miss, welp, time to restart the mission for the 1000th time.can build the best base in the world and still not win because they're just peppering me with shots that I am responsible for blocking.

,Not Recommended,410900,31339954,Posted: 24 April,all,Johnny Rico.,"It's a cool concept, but for a full release game it's barely playable online.Playing in a private lobby with a friend(s) works well enough, but its almost impossible to play online via the public lobbies. You either wont connect, and on the off chance you get into a lobby and the match starts it's more then likely that 1 or 2 of the other players or yourself will disconnect. Assuming that everyone connects and the match starts, you'll automatically disconnect at any point during the game.This is something that 5 years ago you'd be playing in your browser in school or something, it's now on Steam with a £10 price tag with not an awful lot actually warranting such a cost. Unfortunately because i played just over 2 hours with my friend in private lobbys before playing on public ones I can't refund this.Oh, and if you do get this and start playing, just rush heavy cannon and you'll win. The so called 'steel reinforcements' can be penetrated by almost everything and cost 300 resources to repair/replace. A shot to take 2 layers of reinforcing out costs only 30 or something stupid.

This game can get really tense, an all out battle of destructive and precise weapons which can be grouped, used for a combo of attacks, or fired alone.However, there are issues you should be aware of. There seems to be some fps problems in bigger games, even with a good pc, which I feel will be fixed however. There are not too many servers but this is day 1 so that's totally fine.

There is no way of telling if a game is already running. More than 90% of the attempts at joining fail.

If you enjoy bridge constructor games, you'll love this, as much of the same physics applies. But it's even more fun, because you get to destroy your opponent's creations! If you're on Discord or other voice chat, it's so much fun to hear someone's reaction when you lob a big munition at them.The music and sound effects add a lot. They really affect the gameplay, like when you hear doors open and can expect an incoming barrage.OVERALL: Very much worth a purchase, especially given it's about 1/4 of the cost of an AAA game.

Also it can have really bad lag and there are some bad bugs.changed review too good. improved."
