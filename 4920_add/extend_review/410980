It's got it all, heroes, alien races, ship design, colony management, espionage, diplomacy, research, exploration and explotation. You will colonize planets, invade planets, bombard planets, or destroy planets. You'll go from researching technology to create farms in planets with no atmosphere to developing the means to turn a radioactive planetoid into a Gaia class homeworld for your race to live in.You'll meet telephathic races, smart races, dumb races, mineral races, cyborgs, cat people and maybe even the Phobos leather godesses cousins. If you like them, you can ally with them. Or you can destroy their ships, enslave their population, and exterminate them. Or go anywhere in betwen.You could be the next galactic chancellor. Or you could be the last man standing. You could steal Orion's secrets for yourself. You can even invade other dimensions in your endless quest to crush aliens like bugs.Your marines will take out enemy forces, colonies, rebellions and even fight enemy crews if you happen to board your opponents ships.Would you build a doomstar to take the heat onto their homeworld, or fortify your own worlds while you hire spies and terrorists to dismantle their planets from within ? Who knows, they may blame someone else. You could even hire that telepath hero to help with the efforts.The amount of choice in this game is astounding. Only two cons for me :1 Turn based combat is excellent at the beginig and middle game. On the later stage, where you have 40 vs 38 battle regularly and each ship has to take a turn, you'd rather click auto-resolve.2 Diplomacy is a bit unpredictable at times, then other times you can just trick the cpu into giving all away.Other than that, this game is *for me* superior to every other space empire strategy game except perhaps it's predecesor, Master of Orion, but that, is a matter of taste."

I have tried other space 4x’s, but they always end up being disappointing.The interface in MoO2 is bright, colorful, easy to understand and navigate. The game feels like a game, with little bogging it down. You won’t find anything resembling an Excel spread sheet, with confusing icons, and a ugly interface.MoO2 is turn based, but don’t let that put you off. The strategic elements are very deep. It has very unique racial traits and technologies that aren’t found in other games, that make MoO2 fun and exciting. And best of all, it’s very balanced. At first, certain traits and technologies won’t seem very balanced. But as you become more experienced, you’ll figure out new combos and strategies that are very powerful. And the traits and technologies you once thought were weak, you’ll learn they counter the strategy you just figured out. In multi player games, I had other players laugh at me for the picks I would take. Around turn 100, they weren’t laughing anymore. This is why I keep coming back to MoO2. There is always something new to discover and figure out. Employing a new strategy that no one else has ever seen, and to see it work, is a great feeling!One of the best parts of MoO2, is ship design and ship combat. This is where turn base outshines real time. You get to decide what technologies, systems, and weapons go into the ship. Then during combat, you decide what each individual technology does, and what each individual weapon targets. For example, a single ship can fire heavy guns at one ship, fire point defense guns at a group of fighters, fire missiles at another ship, then lock tractor beams onto another and engage in ship boarding combat to capture it.There are three ways to win a game of MoO2. First is to eliminate all other races. Second is to get elected leader of the galaxy. And the final way is to assemble a powerful fleet to defeat an end boss fleet and home world."

,Recommended,410980,26926884,"Posted: 23 November, 2016",all,KOTOFANA,"For everyone who didnt notice this already on his own. This game is not new and to be more precise its over 20 years old, therefore the graphics dont look like the new games.You're in space and you're ruling an empire to conquer the universe. To reach the top you can select one of the 13 very unique races, each race has its own traits, advantages, weakness and history. Additionally you can even create your own custom race, where you can select any boni or mali that you desire. After youve made a choice, you can competete with up to 7 other empires to conquer the stars. You'll be able to plan every of your colonies, decide which scientific field will be the most useful for you, customize and improve your starships, recruite special leaders for your ships or your colonies, negotiate peace, technological trades or multiple other contracts with other empires, command the tactical battles of your fleets or even destroy entire planets. The AI in MoO2 is pretty decent, even compared to new games - its above average. The AI plays to win, different Empires act differently, the AI is aggressive, the AI expands, the AI researches away from you, the AI wins games. Now part of it is, like for nearly any 4x game, on higher difficulty the AI gets extra boni. As already said this is nothing special for 4X games, and I cant name any big name, where this would be different. Now something that is special about it, is that the AI uses them in a favorable way for them and there are we again; the AI is decent enough to bring you a fight for the money, even on the ""moderate"" difficulties, the AI will play good enough to destroy new players. Luckily you have plenty of different difficulties to adjust your own learning curve. So higher difficulties give a real challenge for the best of us, while the more easier give everyone a proper way to find into the battle. So anyone who starts playing this, may he completly new to 4x or may it be Napoleon that needs a bigger challenge after conquering middle europe, youll find plenty of fun and challenge here.Last but not least, multiplayer sessions still work. Depending on your computer, you might need a workaround, but the forum will help you with it (not only steamboards, but MoO2 has a small yet active community spread outside of here). MP games need a bit of planning. First because the game sessions itself can be very long - again nothing bad for 4X games. Second because the playerbase is small. Yet its big enough to find them! Thats something that not every 20year old game can say about itself.Despite my low amount of hours on the steamversion of MoO2, I played this game a lot. I might've played it for easily more than 1000hours within all those years and I played and beat all the difficulties."
76561198061304867,Recommended,410980,32628391,Posted: 21 June,all,truthwiz,"There's a reason why people still rave about this game after all these years. It's about as close to a perfect 4x game as you can get. The races are fun and unique. The point system for custom races actually make sense. The difficulty levels actually allow you to learn as you go up each increment of difficulty. Colony management is well organized and enjoyable. The tech tree has many powerful and satisfying options. There are multiple ways to handle the difficult situations you can get into, yet there can be severe penalties if you get too far in over your head. And tactical combat is often...er...a total blast dude. In seriousness, it's actually a lot of fun. You have the option to control every move of every ship; and potetntially fire on several targets per ship depending on your ship's loadout. The music and sound effects are great as well. This game has absurd levels of replayability. I was playing it in 1997. It's TWENTY years later, and I love it more than ever.On another note. It is SO sad that those who control the fate of this franchise can't seem to get their s%^t together. Master of Orion 3 was garbage, and the (recent) reboot of the game is receiving mixed reviews at best.  It's on sale right now and I'm not feeling that enthused about buying it. In large part because a freaking game from 1996 is more satisfying than anything else in the genre. If they could just COPY this game (MOO2) and update the graphics and animation, they would have a pure winner. But I'm sure bigger egos are prevailing... Sad.Buy this game. Play it. And just be careful you don't lose your job, ruin your relationship, or end up getting your electricity shut off."

It has been installed on every computer I've owned since that time. I have also purchased it from GOG and as part of the collector's edition of the new Master of Orion. It has aged quite well and is still an enjoyable game to play in 2016.This is one of the grandfathers of the turn-based strategy genre and if you've ever heard of the term 4x strategy, it comes from this game. You eXpand, eXplore, eXploit, and eXterminate. You start with one planet and scout nearby planets and colonize them in an attempt to grow your empire. Along the way, you'll need to research new technologies, build fleets, train spies, build improvements on your planets, engage alien races in diplomacy, and whatever else it takes to ensure that your empire thrives.The game is fairly intuitive and you should get the basic idea of how to play after a game. Individual games can take several hours like a game of Civilization. There is a great custom race editor that allows you to tweak your own race with attributes that go well with your play style. It's a fun and epic game with some really nice background music. The turn-based ship battles are pretty fun as well.I don't know if this will release as a standalone game later on, but if not, you can always get MOO1+2 at GOG. If you don't mind the outdated graphics, this is a fun strategic space game that will make you want to click next turn just one more time.Favorite game of all time/10"

In my humble opinion, at any rate.This version runs on DOSBox, but it does run, and it runs nicely. There are some minor glitches with speed - in that when you're trying to scroll around the battle-map you tend to find that scrolling is painfully fast, and when ships are moving (turn-based), they do so at ridiculous speeds, making the whole thing a bit confusing.  There are, I am told, fixes for this, but it just seemed like a bit too much effort.Don't let that put you off too much. This is a classic that is well worth owning if you like your turn-based 4X space games. It has aged - not poorly - but noticeably, and you'll spot a lot of interface annoyances that have been fixed in later games, simply by virtue of the fact that they're more modern.Still, I love it. I'm bad at it, but I love it. I've been playing it a lot since it was first released, and finding it on Steam was a very nice surprise.  I *have* to recommend this one... but the caveat is that it is an old game, and if that's giving you some pause, I would recommend that you check out a Let's Play video or something before committing yourself."

It's also in space.The only problem is that it is difficult for beginners. It's not that it's incredibly difficult (at least on the right levels), but more that there's nothing resembling a tutorial. MOO2's version of ""Civilopedia"" is pretty sparse as well. The good news is that you can right-click on almost anything and it'll be explained.The other thing that bugs me about this game (but I've only played like 1.5 hours so lol) is that is SO HARD TO EXPLORE. In civ, you can send out like one scout and he can explore the world. It might take a while, but there's not really any limit to how far he can go. In MOO2 the ships can only go 2 parsecs (which is almost nothing) away from your closest base, which means that you have to build a ton of bases in order to visit planets besides your next door neighbors.Despite these two issues, the game is still enjoyable. I love the thrill of picking a desolate planet and filling with colonists to subdue it and enrich you.Graphics btw are AMAZING compared to my standards for 1996. Dozens of times better than Civ2, which looks pretty bad compared to this. They still hold up ok, but my standards are pretty low in the graphics department. The screenshots are representative of the game.I say if you like 4X games, if you like space colonization games, or even if you're just a patient gamer looking for a good deal, get this game. I mean, MOO2 is like $6 and it includes the original Master of Orion.UPDATE: It turns out that the difficulty of exploring was because I was playing as the Klackons, who don't get to choose what technology they research in a given generation, and I happened to not get a chance to research a certain kind of fuel cells. Playing as other races (or even better, the Psilons) makes the game much easier."

I'd spend hundreds of hours in single games, learning everything I could, building colonies on every planet possible, pushing the AI down to just one tiny planet, and just torment the crap out of the Antarans every time they'd come to attack me.  My only issue with this port of the game is that I have a constant static sound whenever there's music playing.  I can't recall if that was in the original (like a kid in the 90s ever cared about a little issue like that lol), or maybe it's just a sound issue with the headphones I have (not the first game to sound ""odd"" since I've gotten them).

This is a great game I have been playing for over 20 years and I am delighted to have a version that will play on newer versions of Windows. Like any retro game, the graphics, video, and sound is several generations behind today, but far superior to the standard of those just a year or two older, like the original MOO (which comes bundled with this.)MOO2 is a 4X game that has reasonably deep gameplay in terms of worlds, races, tech, etc. The animations of new discoveries are better than even some newer games (it's fun to see a 360 view of a new fusion rifle or such.) The races are interesting and can be customized. As with the original, the real fun is building your ships to fit your own style and taste. Tactical combat will not wow by today's standards, but is sufficiently gratifying to actually see how well, or not, your design decisions are working. I personally prefer using modified Elerians. Their psionics are great for conquering worlds with a minimum of destruction and since the ground combat system is fairly weak (no tactics), you aren't missing much. Also, MOO2 introduced leaders to the system. Unlike its cousin, Master of Magic, the leaders provide some entertaining spice to worlds and battles, but are not overpowering.The other great thing about MOO2 were the choices the player gets to make, including three paths to victory, ranging from election, to domination, to defeating the mysterious Antarans in their own dimension.Although you have to love the original, and some platers still prefer it, to me MOO2 is the best in the series and still a lot of fun 20 years on. It is definitely superior to the much less graphic and dull MOO3, whicn Steam seems to be avoiding like most players did. Of course, it would be nice to see the pack expanded to include the legendary MoM as well!"

The one that gave us both the computer and the game absolutely insisted that we go with Strategic Combat only, but after a month of that I decided to try out Tactical combat.  I never looked back.Playing on Easy difficulty was a challenge at first to get to know all the mechanics, but of course you have to gradually grow up the ladder to a higher difficulty.  My very first encounter with the Stellar Converter was on Easy difficulty.  A single ship was coming into my planet, so I sent my fleet to meet it at the planet expecting an easy win like usual.That first turn the planet was annihilated by a squealing yellow beam that I had not seen before.  All defenses gone, all population gone.  Only my orbital was present with the five ships I sent.  I did not even learn what weapon it was until several years later when I actually took the time to read /all/ of the technologies in the game.Ahhh, memories.  Nowadays I play on the hardest difficulty with very little trouble.  Not even the Silicoid ever pose a threat to me even if they send out 500 ships, but all I will ever need is one.  Phasing Cloak + Time-Warp Facilitator = Win...  Just need to WAIT until all enemy ships have moved that turn before attacking.  Otherwise, even with damper fields and Xentronium armor you're toast.My ultimate loadout:2 Stellar Converters (at 250 space apiece - Weapons Hypertech 6 required)6 Tractor Beams4 Assault Shuttles99 Gauss Cannons (Heavy, Auto-Fire)99 Gauss Cannons (Auto-Fire)Any other weapons I wantBattle PodsStructural Analyzer (2x damage after shields penetrated)Achilles Targeting Unit (Ignore armor, including Heavy Armor and Xentronium)Phasing CloakSubspace TeleporterTime-Warp FacilitatorDamper FieldSlot 8 whatever I want to have at the timeWith this loadout, even Adamantium Armor has difficulty holding up.  Gauss loves targeting internal systems, so you'll be experiencing a /LOT/ of sudden explosions from the enemy ships due to a Warp Core Breach that damages other nearby ships...which can even trigger chain reactions if the shields are penetrated.  Works for the Orion Guardian, too, and much more reliable than the Ion Pulse Cannon.  You /WILL/ need Disruptors or better if you're going up against a Planetary Barrier Shield, though."

Once you know how to play the game, and learn to survive against the NPCs that somehow have better technology than you even though you're a creative democracy with a plus in science... then it pretty much becomes a really intence game that comes with the nature of any 4X game, and in this one, being able to be the best race and win is so satisfying.

And while dated they still bring so much feeling and life to the game that most modern games in this category lack.It's got all of the gameplay that you would expect from a 4x, delivered so close to perfection that no game since has been able to really improve upon it. You can't improve bacon!Cons... I'm sure there is one. Every game has a con, right?"

Loads of interesting choices in the tech tree, customizable ships, customizable races, detailed colony management, and surpisingly deep tactical combat are all present. If you like 4X space games, you owe it to yourself to give this a try! It's the gold standard."

If you take too long the 'end battle' gets harder, bu that in turn gives it an extra challenge. For me it is one of the games I tend to replay from time to time after sinking way too many hours into it when it first came out. Gee... I feel old :P"

Im from sweden som I might have spelled somthing wrong.This game is very good. I haven't tested the first or bought the third game so I can't say anything about them. It has a tutorial dificulty so that you get a chance to learn how the game works.I've got to say this: I've seen one of the rewivs of master of orion 3 and that sayd that it's bad that you can't create a custom race... BUT in this game the you do that: you only copy the looks of a one race and change the traits and give it a new name. you can still change the traits in MoO3. Is it really that nessecary to have to name it?Back to the game: It's a trun based strategy game that lets you lead one of 13 ( i think) races to ither dominate the galaxy or defeat the antarans. the interface is simpel and easy to understand. If you want to know obut stof on the interface or what as special technologi does (because you also reaserch tech or steal it with spyes or get it gy conquring a planet) simply right click on it. turn on tactical kombat if you want to see the ships blow up eacother or if you want to control them, otherwise the ai imedietly aoutoresolves it and you don't get to se the fight. ground combat you can't control but you will always see the fighting.It is a very good game and i like it.If you dont like mikromangeging, take this instead of MoO3. I've heard that there is a lot of it in that game."

Ahead of its time for gender equality.It's probably the best game you can get on Steam for under $8."

76561198263731773,Recommended,410980,35308217,Posted: 29 September,all,fraill10,Has been one of my all time favorite games since it first came out way back when. Getting it again has been fun and the gameplay has held up for the most part. Sometimes though memories are fonder than reality. I forgot how much micro managing it takes and that the games take a long time. It may be the difference between being a kid with nothing better to do and being an adult with too much to do. I still recommend for anyone that is a fan of the genre.
