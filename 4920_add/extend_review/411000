76561198048974498,Recommended,411000,22824996,"Posted: 6 May, 2016",all,rjmacready,"I sorta, kinda, all-but promised myself that I'd take a break from all the recent Fighting Fantasy gamebook adaptations.  Sure they remind me of my childhood, and therein have a certain weighty sentimental appeal, but they ultimately frustrate me on account of how appallingly arbitrary and ruthlessly trial-and-error they can be.  In spite of this, I got just the tiniest bit excited when I saw this particular product, because, well...ahem...let's try to justify ourselves here...Firstly, the Sorcery! books were never Fantasy Fantasy books, strictly speaking.  They were more of an off-shoot series authored exclusively by just one of the two FF founders - Mr Steve Jackson - and were an attempt to do something a bit more ambitious and immersive than the FF books.  Secondly, while Tin Man Games have actually done a very good job of faithfully adapting a number of FF books, the fact that this series was being tackled by a completely different company, in a slightly LESS faithful manner, made me think...hmmm, perhaps inkle Ltd have actually eradicated some of the aspects of the ye-olde gamebooks which I've never been so keen on.  So...have they?  Well, kind of.  A little.  But not a whole HECK of a lot, no...This is definitely more of a ""video game"" than the Tin Man adaptations.  It has lovingly-rendered maps, around which you can move a figurine of your adventurer, and combat this time isn't so strictly governed by virtual die-rolls.  The combat system employed by this game is...well, different.  Possibly even a bit more strategic than sheer-and-utter RNG antics, but...not by much.  It still felt pretty random and luck-driven to me; though in all fairness, it's entirely possible that I just didn't ""get it"" (but hey, at least the illustrations were nice).  Oh, and the spell-casting system is actually pretty nifty, and handled in an atmospheric manner which helps to deliver the player from the potentially ""stuffy"" realms of interactive fiction, and into the decidedly more ""spiffy"" realms of modern video-gaming.The Sorcery! books were also a tad less guilty of the ultra-linear, anti-backtracking style of FF gamebooking, in which you'd better hope that you fluke the right direction at the three-way T-junction or it's GAME OVER for you, buddy-boy.  Add to this a ""rewind"" button kindly provided by the devs of this adaptation, allowing you to go back one, two, maybe even three decisions, and I actually managed to get through Part 1 on the FIRST ♥♥♥♥ING TRY.  Perhaps miracles CAN happen, after all?  Alas, by Part 2, we were back to old tricks again, and I managed to die in a spot in which hitting the rewind button just threw me back to the same no-win predicament, not just once, but TWO PLAYTHROUGHS IN A ROW.  The exact same frigging spot, despite me attempting to handle the situation in a different manner both times.  So for the time being, a third attempt is just gonna have to wait...'cause I really don't have the heart to do it all over again so soon.  Nice while it lasted, though, and at least having a number of different ""paths"" to follow gives it all acceptable replayability (even if all roads do, ultimately, lead to Rome).So would I at least recommend this more than the Tin Man adaptations?  Yes.  Slightly.  The Sorcery! books were in all honesty never my favourites when I was young - I was always a tiny bit more partial to Ian Livingstone as a writer, and more ""refined"" illustrators like Ian McCaig - but this game at least TRIES to rectify some of the shortcomings which these books have always suffered from.  Or, in other words, your chances of actually completing the game are SLIGHTLY improved this time around, and the experience is a tad more digitally immersive.  It's also better value than the Tin Man products, on account of this purchase netting you not one but TWO gamebooks, for the exact same price; and what's more, it's a four-part epic (the last two parts soon to come) in which you can carry on the same character and inventory from one Part to the next.An absolute must-buy for all you ""gamebook"" freaks out there, but I'm not quite sure about everyone else.  Still, a good enough place to start, should one be curious...Verdict: 8/10."
76561198078833661,Recommended,411000,20917794,"Posted: 2 February, 2016",all,Toni S | Better than +6 treants,"If you like reading a lot of text on which you can base meaningful choices that greatly influence your adventure, you have to try this. If you want to experience everything blind (which I highly recommend), stop reading now. If you're not convinced yet, I hope I will be able to change that.First of all, as I already said, all of your choices either matter, or it does a great job to seem like they do. Also, don't be stupid or an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. That's the best advice I can give you. If, let's say, it says the ground is all made out of rock, you can be sure you won't do much by trying to stab your sword into it... Just saying... Not like I tried or anything... Ok, I did, I thought it would have been cool.Secondly, the combat system is quite unique in the fact that you must try to guess what your enemy's next move will be by reading the description of what you see. Perhaps he looks enraged, or starts moving backwards. It's all essential to determine how much strength you will put in your blow: the more you put, the higher the damage and the higher chance that you will overpower the enemy, meaning you win the round and do the damage. Now, the thing is, the more strength you use, the less you'll have the next round, and you can only replenish it by trying a weak blow or just blocking. This is where the system shines: blocking takes no strength whatsoever and it reduces the damage taken to a minimum. That means that if you don't pay attention to the text when it hints at the enemy trying to block and you use your full strength, not only will you do a small amount of damage, but the low strength next round makes you more exposed to the enemy overpowering you.Now, you may be wondering: what about the spells? It's called ""Sorcery!"" for a reason, right? A lot of times during interactions with the world or NPCs you will have the option of ""Cast a spell!"". How does it work? Well, it's as simple as uniting the stars! No, really, each star has a name and areas where it can be seen and thus used, so you won't be able to cast any spell ever even if you have the materials. Now, you don't need to worry about remembering the full name of the star, just the inital. Using a combination of 3 stars in a specific order, if you have the required stamina/materials, and the stars are available at your current position, you can cast things like ZAP (Lightning bolt), HOT (Fire Ball), FOF (Force Field) and so on. Depending on your situation, especially because stamina is a very important resource (It acts as your health, mana pool, general-being-aliveness), the casting or not of a spell could mean doom or salvation for your brave adventurer.Also, yeah, the art style is charming and the writing pretty good, the unique choices allowing you to create your own very awesome story you will get lost in... Untill you run out of that damn stamina and die, of course!If I still haven't convinced you, read other reviews better written and which explore other cool parts of this game, I would hate to see you pass out such a wonderful experience."

,Recommended,411000,32671802,Posted: 23 June,all,a bathful of lemons,"Inkle's adaptation retains everything I liked about the original books while handling the repetitive dice rolls, inventory management and page turning behind the scenes. Snappy presentation makes the story feel fresh (certainly not 30+ years old) and the sound effects and music pulled me in after just a few opening paragraphs.The game handles spell casting particularly well with new outcomes written for each spell, specific to your current situation. Fall off a cliff and opt to conjure a giant rather than cast levitation? Great, now both you and the giant are falling to your deaths.However, whereas death was frustrating in the books, the game's rewind feature makes these mistakes fun and explorative. It's also a good excuse to see more of the game's excellent writing."

So please think before commenting about the similarity in the reviewsSorcery! Parts 1 and 2 are developed and published by inkle Studios, the same people behind the 80 Days game. Sorcery! is a faithful adaptation of Steve Jackson's Fighting Fantasy gamebooks of the same name and much like them it features an astoundingly well realized worldThe size of world you get to explore is on first glance rather unimpressive but its actually so chock-full of locations you can potentially visit that there is almost no chance you'll be able to see them all even after a couple of playthroughs, there is just so many of themThe writing in Sorcery! is rather excellent. I don't know if it was lifted compltely from the gamebooks or written by the developers themselves but each character has a unique ""voice and tone"" despite never speaking a single word and the locations are so well described I couldn't help but to get myself immersed in all of itBesides simply talking your way through problems you can always ignore them and walk away or perhaps use your sword arm or even magic to solve them. However, while the combat presentation is stellar the actual mechanics themselves leave a lot to desire forSorcery! Parts 1 and 2 contain an incredibly well fleshed out world full of realistic characters, interesting locations and plenty of difficult choices to make which come with actual consequences. The combat system might be lackluster but the writing is absolutely top notch and the few issues Sorcery! has can be easily dismissed once you're immersed in to the worldRECOMMENDED :)"

Part 1 and 2, which I thought I'd be able to finish in a couple of hours, kept me entertained for much longer. Part 1 may be somewhat short, but I believe this is the reason they sell Part 1 and Part 2 together. Part 2 is super long.Of course, how long it is depends on how you play. I personally tried several different choices during most decision making moments, just to see how taking those paths would play out. There is so much to do, and so many things you may miss out in the game by taking only one path. And yet, it is quite impossible to cover all possible paths in one ""playthrough"" - and the game knows this too, apparently.One thing is for sure - this game is very logical. As one other reviewer mentions, don't be stupid. Make conscious, careful decisions as they may affect you negatively, whether immediately or later on in the game. And while ones that affect you immediately may be reversible - with the ever-useful rewind button - the ones that come back to bite you in the butt later aren't (unless you're willing to redo everything), and can be quite a cause for some...deep, deep regret. *ahem*Anyway, this game is fantastic!

,Recommended,411000,25015264,"Posted: 19 August, 2016",all,Mumra,"Many many moons ago, before the age of modern computer games, I owned and enjoyed some of the original Fighting Fantasy books by Ian Livingstone and Steve Jackson. These books were great, but as a young and novice adventurer I was terrible at them. And they were really, really hard; death awaited at every turn. Fortunately you could always flip back a few pages and take a different turn.These digital versions of the Sorcery series of books are no different, but still immensely enjoyable, so long as the idea of reading page upon page of (beautifully written) text doesn't trouble you. Fortunately the adapation to a new medium has allowed Inkle to take out the pain of managing a character sheet, as well as adding variations and mechanics that simply wouldn't be possible in a purely written form, and some other graphical touches such as the map, spellcasting, combat, and gambling.What really shines through, thanks to the text-based narrative, is the ability to take a huge number of different paths through the game, and the feeling that every choice you make really does have big consequences later on in the story - unlike the far more limited narratives of supposedly choice-and-consequence based games by, for instance, Telltale. This is apparent on numerous occasions throughout these first two episodes, and since your character and decisions and carried over into subsequent episodes (part 3 is out already) there is plenty more of this to come. It really manages to feel like a dynamic, living and breathing world.I would highly recommend these games to any fans of the adventure genre, particularly if you ever enjoyed oldschool text adventures or Fighting Fantasy books. The only real minor criticism I have is the interface seems designed much better for touch than for trackpad, but it is still a very simple interface and very easy to play on any device."

But this has the original illustrations, but also opens it out to make it more of a board game experience.● Unlike other FF ports, you have an actual combat system here, some fun dice games, and a very large array of spells. Also it being in four parts lends it an epic scale the regular books don't have. And moving the character physically on the map, gives the text a sense of context as a journey."

I didnt like it, I was thinking what is this? The combat seemed simple and that put me right off the game. I didnt come back to it for months, i think i expected some thing else, i missed dice, like in other fighting fantasy, i didnt know what i wanted, i didnt give it a chance. It was a HUGE mistake. though by coming to it later, I have enjoyed it much more on a level that i didnt appreciate beforeSo I really tried the game out and was open to learning this system because i wanted to play through the story again.Pick a lady model and lets get into the Shamutanti HillsInto the tutorial again and I learned to use the sword. It was only after I mastered the blade, which is a really lovely style, that i realised i was missing out on the heart of the game. I began to play as a sorcerer, rather than a warrior using magic.Now instead of just killing some one, I read its mind, make it dance, talk its language, set it on fire, make it fear or worship me, it depends on the situation, you can get through almost all your encounters using just magic and it became a little game in itself.You will expect to read the story in short paragraphs with choices to make that advance the story and options to replay, theres a feature that lets you rewind your game at will to any point you were at earlier.You collect items to use for magic, some are single use and others are items like a mask, you carry these items through all the parts of the game, you will find things that will help you in the future, in other parts.The combat is a kind of sliding game where you try to guess the opponents next move and how much power they will put into the blow and plan your attack based on this. its is covered in the tutorial.you have a very nice game called swindlestones too, something new not in the original series of books.

From some reviews you may expect a stellar gaming experience, and there is some fun in the game, but it’s not all fun.There are two distinct maps to traverse.  The positives are the first map is challenging and quite an immersive fantasy setting, you’ll probably have to do quite a few attempts at it to progress to map two. The characters you meet are a good variety and you do get a sense of a lone warrior travelling out over vast countryside with varied inhabitants – strange village folk, wanderers, witches, townsfolk, and a wide variety of wildlife inhabitants who threaten you along the way, including the orcs and goblins who are happy to mine in the hills. Quite a bit of rich storytelling and many optional quest paths to take. The combat is reasonable and simple, simply choose defend or select a strength to attack, the storyline will give hints as to whether a creature is looking to attack or defend (in which case there’s no point in a massive attack that saps your energy).  The story telling is quite good in this combat sense to get the details of the battle as it unfolds.  So, all good for map one and I enjoyed this the best and was looking forward to part two.  A good 8/10 for the map 1 experience.Part two was the start of the let-down.  The whole premise of the part is you need to collect clues around the city before proceeding to the end (the North city gate, as all the action on this map is in the city only). The landscape of the “city of traps” just doesn’t feel as immersive, doesn’t lead to conclusions and story progression and as for “traps” I expected a much harder challenge. At one path I got chucked down a sewer which lead me to the exit gate before I had all the clues.  Turns out, it might not be that important after all.  Pretty rubbish I got lead down one path when I wanted to explore.  As it was I “completed” part two first time, no roll backs, by default, so it wasn’t as much a challenge as Part 1.  I could go through again to collect all the clues, but it’s not a compelling proposition to.  It was quite exciting to see a fair set up in the city but even this wasn’t done well – ending up in tents with nothing in them, and beer tents selling river water – what’s the point?  And the endless sewers were pretty boring to be honest.Another aspect of the game I didn’t enjoy was the magic system.  Why have a book of 40 odd spells to learn for a game you will complete in a few hours?  It adds unnecessary confusion.  And as most spells need some item you’re unlikely to have it’s pretty pointless. As for the casting system, spelling out a few letters on the screen based on some swirling letters, it’s not good.  Why not just open the spell book and click to cast?As others have pointed out the “rewind” function is a poor design.  You can get to near the last encounter on a long map, make a bad choice or not have the right items and get killed.  The “rewind” only puts you back to the start of the encounter! So, you could be stuck in a never ending loop of death with no escape.  It would have been better if you can actually “rewind” to prior encounters.With all this said, the price of £6.99 is a reasonable price, and picking up at any less is a bargain.  You will have a good few hours of casual role playing fun and I’d recommend this game for that.  If you are a fan of role playing or text based adventures, or curious about the genre, this is a buy and a good introduction to the genre.  Could have done better, but not too bad."

The magic system is so creative thatI enjoy going back and seeing what else I can do.. or find unthinkable surprises which would seem unapplicable with this or that spell.There are so many paths and choices that still weave to a central narrative, also allowing for outcomes that aren't always the same.Pro/Con ratings are 1-3 + or - signs. Based on how good or helpful they are, or reverse for the negative.Pros:+++Versatile magic system based on words. Some secrets here. Some require items and you will likely be able to find what you need later if you missed the earliest chance to gain the ability to cast whatever spell.++ You can rewind, useful to experiment with magic or various ideas for strategies. GREAT for those moments where you are supremely frustrated with what ends up being a bad idea in the extreme. I recommend you use it sparingly unless you are just having fun with it. At least play through once without/with minimum use.+ Combat is not bad, extremely unique but ultimately good and removing it would be much worse. Not a great system but very unique in how it's done. Definitely would not change it.+++ Most spells are infinite use, some require limited items, ""Stamina"" [HP and ""Mana""] is used for health, fighting, and various other things. Food and potions restore it. All this is very well balanced so you can't abuse magic that doesn't require limited use items.+ Stamina restoration is well balanced and can periodically prayed for if in a bind.- Stamina restoration can sometimes be very hard to keep up but rewinding lets you easily get out of ""broken"" situations without frustration. If you rewind only in ""broken"" situations then you will need to be sparing with your stamina restoration and be familiar with your options. This is not bad so much as requiring to be psychic or overuse of rewinding. Overall a petty problem though.--/+ Combat is extremely dangerous. You can lose a lot of Stamina with little to no reward. This gets a plus too because it depends on your opinion. I feel it's a bit unbalanced as far as the return is often not worth the combat so I tend to overuse magic to avoid it.-/+ Dice is fun but hard to figure out for me. Good system, decent tutorial built in, not much worth. There ARE items and special things/reasons to play though. Worth figuring out.--- Biggest complaint: Some spells are mysteriously unusable despite being fairly expected to be usable in some situations that are not. I don't mean ""all spells should have some use always"". But spells are sometimes mysteriously unable to be cast even if you can in other situations.Overall a great CYOA game. The best pure one/series I've seen. Outside of text-only ones like Choice of Games... those are a mixed bag though. This is best overall."

Sorcery! feels exactly like playing those again, weighing up the options, trying to guess what might lie ahead, hoping that the next page turn won't end in death. My main concern coming to this was how the combat was going to be implemented, but inkle have managed to give it the same risk/reward feel as the other decisions in the story, albeit somewhat dominated by RNG, but you can always retry any disastrous combat.In fact, you can re-take any decision. In a brilliant development choice by inkle you can rewind to any previous decision to try out another option without starting the whole book again. Some might say that this renders decisions meaningless, and that's a valid view, although there's nothing stopping you from never using the rewind feature. Personally I think this makes it even more like a true CYOA experience, speaking as someone who kept his thumb in the previous page...The presentation is beautiful, laid out like a hand painted boardgame, and the sounds are great, adding to the atmosphere without overpowering or distracting from the text which is obviously the focus.If you're a fan of story driven gameplay where decisions have consequences then you should definitely pick this up."

But once I got used to the spell system (and rewind option!) it began to get interesting.Part 2 downright *shines* for bringing to life a bustling city of traps and unsavory characters. The use of sub-locations (mansions, sewers, inns, etc.) creates an uncanny sense of vastness and reminds me of what I loved most about the early Ultima games in entering a city or dungeon -- the illusion of filled-in presence and life amidst a tiny part of the map. I haven't had that sensation of wonder in a computer game in a very long time.Sorcery! has smart writing, charm, and a seemingly endless supply of suspenseful, surprising, and exciting encounters. The game (esp. after Part 1) expands the gamebooks *radically* so that by Part 2 you really sense that it has escaped any of the limits of a paper gamebook and become something truly its own, both in how and what it does for RPGs.Highly recommended -- a big win for Inkle here -- so happy to see this finally make it to PC.

There are many legitimate choices involved in the game, but it doesn't feel like they ultimately amount to much beyond tools with which to approach later challenges. The ability to replay events that go poorly is nice so as to avoid the need to replay the whole game when something goes wrong, but it takes much of the suspense out of things.

,Not Recommended,411000,20968088,"Posted: 5 February, 2016",all,Kuro,"tl;dr - Looks beautiful. The sorcery is okay but a bit cheesy. The combat is at least better than dice rolls.  There are issues with writing being either really bad or really good with no in-between. Has a lack of resolution options, control options, and no way to customize font size. Would be the perfect for my 10in windows tablet but font is so small on the flags i'll go blind trying to read them.Long version - Sometimes the writing is really good and sometimes it's really bad. There is no in-between. Particularly the choice of encounters. Many of them feel incredibly forced as if thrown in for the sake of having something happen but without much thought about the implications or logic of the situation. For example, being accosted by someone who is suspicious of you for having the audacity to travel through his village. A village that's situated on a main road! Not only are they are on a main road and are going to have people passing through their village all the time, but they even have an inn! Obviously there's enough traffic to keep the inn in business. What kind of idiot lives on a main road that has enough travelers to keep an inn in business and then gets super suspicious when a lone traveler passes along the road? Seriously? It's not a natural reaction at all. But just feels forced by the author for the sake of having an encounter when he couldn't come up with anything better. Luckily when the writing is good it's really good, so it balances out somewhat.The magic system is okay. Somewhat cheesy in its implementation although it looks nice. The combat is better than dice rolls, so props to them for that, but it doesn't take much skill since there is an optimum technique and once you find it you'll only ever use that which limits variety.It would be the perfect thing for my 10 inch windows touch screen tablet, since it would feel even more like reading a book, but since they have no touch screen support (all it would take would be an on screen zoom in and out button since everything else works perfectly) i was forced to play it with a mouse plugged in. There are no graphics options and no way to scale the size of the font, so if you have a small screen then you're going to go blind trying to read the text on the flags. Mainly because of the lack of options and poor choice of encounters I'm giving a thumbs down.  However it has a lot of good points. The presentation is just superb, the art is lovely, and the ambient sounds really help to draw you into the story."

You can rewind the choices you make...sort of...if you come to an area that has multiple paths, you can only choose one, you can rewind, but you cant make a choice, then backtrack to  explore other paths.

It is a lot like the old choose your own adventure books, where you read a text description of events, and then choose among several actions, each with their own consequences. The battle part of the game seems simple, but there is actually some skill involved which can allow you to win battles you wouldnt think you could. The fly in the ointment, for me anyway, lies in the fact that A) there is no save function in conjunction with B) you get a one step rewind function so you can replay choices that lead to your death or the end of the game. The problem with this is, at times a one step rewind doesnt get you out of the death loop. As an example, at one point, my character ends up in jail. He hadnt done the thing he needed to do to get out, and so the rewind always leads to him being in jail and the game ends no matter what choices I make. This happened several times in different ways, and it is frustrating to have to completely start over for such an arbitrary reason. I really enjoyed the game, but I have no urge to pick it up again because of this isue.I am going to recommend it, but only if you understand ahead of time that this is an issue.

Initially I was dissapointed because alot of cool stuff from the book is absent. Although there is a lot of missing content, it turns out that might not be such a bad thing. This game actually expands on Jackson's work, adding MUCH more story, dialouge, encounters, characters, locations, etc. Overall, it is a net gain. There are even more things to see and do in the game version, to the point where you could probably play 3-4 times and not see it all. It is astounding how much content there is.Perhaps most importantly, the story is more fleshed out. There were strange gaps in the original where it seemed like there should be some more plot connecting some of the lore/events. There was also a few issues of choice and consequence, where essentially what you did usually didn't matter too much. Both of these issues were fixed in the game version. Overall, the world feels more real and engaging.Another important thing to note is that this game did an excellent job translating the book mechanics to a video game. Instead of the die roll system that was based purely on RNG, the combat system has more to do with skill. It's reasonably realistic, fun, and challenging. It can be kind of easy to cheese, but anything is better than the RNG system from the books.The visuals are also stunning. The combat and spellcasting have good animations that are backed up by vivid descriptions. The in game art, such as the world map, is beautiful to look at and occasionally borrows from the books, which old fans like me will appreciate.There are also a lot of little details they added which make this game come to life. And in my experience, the little things can make or break a game. In this case, they make it. Here's a quick list:-in game inventory system-you can choose gender now-miniature based on your gender-""rewind"" system-sound affects-in game gambling system-some of the super punishing and arbitrary sections of the books removedFinal words:This game basically feels like playing D&D solo with a really good DM. The world of Sorcery! is vibrant, interesting, and full of realistic characters (as Steve Jackson imagined it). I reccomend it for newcomers, as well as for fans of the original books because this version is different enough that the two mediums provide totally different experiences. At the reasonable price of this game, especially on sale, it's a steal. The developers clearly put a lot of love into recreating and improving Sorcery!."

I have been looking at this game for a while, and was skeptical from the reviews being stark opposites of each other and having read that the decisions you make only affect your gear, not your story. (Keeping in mind that Witcher 3 is somewhat similar to that premise)I played through Part 1, died twice (to avoid spoliers, lets just say I experienced a Wizard of Oz moment) and loved every perilous, misguided step along the way. The story is truely deep, the characters make you feel for them (though not always in a good way), and you are thrown into an adventure even when you are just looking to sleep.While at this moment I believe in the criticisms of the items being the only thing that changes the outcomes from game to game, I don't see that as a bad thing as the items seem to be specific to each encounter.More things to come, and I'll change the review as needed.*REVIEW IN PROGRESS*"

Tons of options, great writing, and extraordinarily fun. It truly felt like sitting down around a table at D&D and playing a quick session with a party of one (sometimes more). I look forward to playing Part 2 and will almost certainly get the next two parts as well."

There are so many dialogue options and routes to go you will never get bored, this game feels as free as possible while still making sure you are progressing forward. You are allowed free range over this giant spell book, allowing you to cast one of many spells any time you get yourself stuck, or you can say heck it and just fight with your sword, sometimes you are even allowed to simply talk your way out of what appeared to be hostile situations and instead make powerful allys. I honestly cannot recommend this game enough, it is such an immersive, stress free, and engaging adventure with beautiful artwork and memorable characters.Also, Steve Jackson if you see this, please give us a spin off with Flanker the Assassain! I was seriously hoping my hero would marry this amazing guy.."

This is unique and the developers and artists and producers really cared about what they were making and it shows, so if you have the guts take your first steps into this world and be prepared for a journey that will never be the same as any one else's.The choice is yours..."

They did it right...It's actually way more interactive than most of these kinds of things and it has a sense of humor.Wanna inhale water? Go ahead. You'll die, but you pretty much will just rewind.Rewind it a bit abusable but if you have self control you'll only use it if you die or accidentally click the wrong box.idk what else to write, but I highly reccomend this game.Also Swindlestones takes way more skill than Hearthstone"

The combat isn't stellar, but it is kind of nice and has some strategy to it.The most fun I had about it is the magic. Although, it is a simple system it was fun being able to use logic rather than brute force in many different encounters. Either using it to gain an advantage in combat or completely avoiding an encounter and negating damage in various instances.The series is fun and definitely worth the amount I picked it up for. The writing has so much detail and makes me want to read every bit of it including the writing in the combat."
