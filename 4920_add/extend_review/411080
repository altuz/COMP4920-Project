Feels extremely unfinished.Pickups are literally just placeholder spheresCrosshair reticle and bullets do not match upBomb shoots 90 degrees SIDEWAYS from the direction you are facingEnemies seem to spawn with no regard to your position, meaning sometimes right behind youNo veriety in enemiesYou often randomly die at 100 health from what I assume is enemies spawning on top of youYou can get stuck on debris from blowing up wallsThere is a rediculously annoying slow-motion effect when you kill something, I thought the game was lagging out at firstThis should be in early access, and even then it's not really presentable. I honestly feel like all the positive reviews where bought by the developer or something, it's completely perplexing."

The game is like Pac man and the movie The Running Man lol You need to run around blasting all that moves or blast anything in your way. You then collect the orbs White Points , Green Health and Red Rockets.The Dev or Devs are still adding and Tweaking it atm but it runs pretty sweet as is. I think for the $0.99 cents price tag this is one you might want to pick up and im sure in time they will add more but if not its fun as is .So for the pirce i say pick this up if you are a fan of cheap neat games or what i like to call time killers!"

No Invert mouse option2. No in game menu3. No weapon shop or costumability4. No Multiplayer5. No Multiple game modes, some would be Survival, Hardcore, Multiplayer, Team Deathmatch, and others, I understand that this is not a FPS game like Call Of Duty or Battlefield, but I really do love this game and I think it would be more fun with these options.So, if you like a game like Call of Duty, Counter Strike: Global Offensive, or Battlefield, then this is not the game for you, but if you like simple fun games that you can just hop on and play, then this is the game for you... :D"
76561198030806857,Recommended,411080,21364442,"Posted: 21 February, 2016",all,Lair,"SHOWTIME 2073Platform: PCMSRP: $0.99Link to Lair Gaming's video review:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMmHRHvU4DA&feature=gp-n-y&google_comment_id=z12gtzd50wvwhd2yv04ccxrqoximyv3prso0kWelcome to the Lair Gaming review of PACMAN: RELOADED! Wait, no, that's not right. Oh, yeah - SHOWTIME 2073.Showtime 2073 without a doubt draws inspiration from the aforementioned yellow dot-gobbler. Armed with what almost feels like a fully automatic version of the flak cannon from Unreal Tournament - you are tasked with collecting a number of round orbs from a maze-like map while assaulted from all angles by robots highly trained in martial arts. Has this caught your interest? It probably should.Gameplay in Showtime 2073 not only looks like Unreal Tournament - it lives and breathes like it too. Running is a little floaty - and the fact that sprinting isn't a persistent feature leaves you constantly having to press and hold shift after each shot or jump. This sounds really nitpicky, but I honestly don't remember a circumstance where I didn't want to be sprinting - so having the default movement speed at sprint level would have been nice here. In addition, jumping was a frustrating affair on occasion. I would find myself trying to jump over portions of wall and getting stuck atop while enemies piled up on either side below. The engine was somehow unable to handle me riding the top of the wall and eventually would choose a direction to roll me off. In addition to some complaints regarding movement - I also wish there was some kind of impact sound or hit marker to show that you landed shots on your targets - but with the hectic movement and need to ""spray and pray"" to survive, I understand that there isn't really room for this nitpick to be completely satisfied. Lastly, I wish there was an option to disable the frequent slow-mo that comes when you kill enemies in quick succession. After a while, I did get used to it - and there were even some times I felt thankful for it when I was surrounded by enemies.In my almost 3 hours with SHOWTIME 2073 to date, I've managed to get to level 5 a couple of times - but I've yet to finish it. The difficulty really ramps up when you hit level 4 and the game doesn't save your progress when you close the application (which is done by pressing the escape key - I learned accidentally). Luckily, deaths only take you back to the beginning of the current level rather than the beginning of the game.SHOWTIME's soundtrack is wild. It's just a nonstop, body-shakingly loud bass attack throughout. I never got tired of it, but this just isn't music I'd be listening to in my spare time. That said, when my heart was racing - the heavy beat became the perfect track.Visually, you're not going to feel like you're playing a game you paid sub-$1.00 for. The visuals are crisp and remind me of all of my favorite arena shooters. There aren't a ton of assets used in total. Weapon fire always looks the same and environments don't vary all that much. Still, where it counts, SHOWTIME 2073 delivers. Enemy variety is an excellent way that the developer knew his audience. I counted 5 total enemy types. It doesn't seem like much, but for the price - I honestly expected a single enemy type for every level.SHOWTIME 2073 did make me want to go back and play Unreal Tournament 2004 again - but most importantly, it made me want to put that off a little while longer so I could stay in the task at hand. This game is so much fun - and I wholly recommend it when you have a spare dollar in your Steam account from selling old trading cards in the market. OK, maybe that's just the story of me finding this hidden gem.Gameplay - 78Visuals/Art Style - 73Audio - 72Content-to-cost at $0.99 - 90For what it's worth, I give SHOWTIME 2073 on PC a: 78/100."

However, since its very launch, the developer keeps promising a very much needed update and he never delivers.Cool as the concept may be, the game is basically unfinished, with very basic functions still lacking and a gameplay that seems just a proof of concept but doesn't really go anywhere.If you look at the message board, you will see that for more than a year, everytime there is a sale or some other event, the developer will come back and promise that this time the update is coming for real, but then he just forgets about it. Or some times he wants us to support his new game. One time, in order to get people to finance his new kickstarter, he even told us that multiplayer was in the works and we could betatest it.I used to think that the developer had just made the mistake of overpromising, and was now desperately looking for a way of making everyone happy with the obvious limitations of a one-man team. But at this point it feels more like a fraud."

That being said this game is awesome. It drops you in a pacman-like maze with a gun and swarming enemies. If you're cornered go ahead and destroy a nearby wall because this game also has destruction physics. The game is simple enough and you can learn all you need to learn just by playing.

,Recommended,411080,21354564,"Posted: 20 February, 2016",all,Dr. Dick Stomper,"TL; DR: This game is Blue Sphere special Stage from Sonic 3 with lasers.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0yKuLopp8cThis game is probably one of the more better games from the Dollar Bin.However, it gets incredibly repetative. Your average run of the mill enemey takes one shot to take down. Not much of a challenge. The game knows this and as levels increase they just add more gimmicks; Robots who don't die. Spiders for some reason and turrets. None of which are challenging, but more annoying then anything.Any level that is an even number (2,4,6...) was probably the most enjoyable. These stages are large and open and only have 10 balls to collect which is nice enough. In exchange it just spawns baddies at an increased rate.On any odd stage you have to navigate a maze and collect 100 balls, green ones give health red ones are ""rockets.""These rockets aren't really rockets and the game even refers to them as Mines at one point. They explode and thats enough.I wish we could get a ""Meh"" rating. This entertained me for about half an hour and I'm probably not going to play it ever again. But, I support indie developers and would like to see more if it can get even better than this."

Running could be toggled instead of always pressed (which is fine except when a. jumping, you have to take your finger off and press again. b. whenever bullet time occurs, same problem). 2. shoting matched aiming--there is lag time there, not terrible. 3. New music. 'Nuf said."

You also cannot jump while in the rubble.Shooting the laser causes really annoying slowdown which breaks the flow of the game.You will randomly die for no reason. I died 3 times without enemies hitting me as I was simply running.Its still decent for a buck though.
