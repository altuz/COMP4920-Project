I would recommend buying copies for your friends too, since theres not usually people online to play with, and its super cheap."

It is worth WAY more than the 2 dollars it costs, and even if you don't like it, it's only 2 dollars that you wasted!""-Original ReviewAlright, I decided I should put more effort into it. This game is better than all other turn-based space strategy games because:*Doesn't do too much behind the scenes, so using the highest quality setting won't affect performance 90% of the time, and means most computers that aren't 5 years old and slow as ♥♥♥♥ can run it with no problems, even at the highest quality setting.*Is innovative in the sense that the whole board moves, or 'orbits', around the center. This may not seem like that will make any difference. However, at corners the rings closer to the center end up moving farther than the rings on the edge. Because of this, you have to plan ahead to how things move to make sure you move/aim things in the right position/direction.*Costs only two dollars! Because of this, if you don't like it, it doesn't matter that the money spent on this game was put to waste.Anyways, that was my first REAL review on a game, if there are any errors in the review, please tell me so. I hope you enjoy this game!"

,Recommended,411120,23549475,"Posted: 14 June, 2016",all,Mushy,"Honestly, this game isn't bad at all. It's actually very innovative. It's a strategy, in space, with a twist. The map's hexagonal fields rotate every turn, simulating an orbit, and giving you something extra to think about in advance when planning ahead.I got it during a weeklong sale, wanting to get rid of spare change in my Steam wallet. Since it had positive reviews, I decided to try it, and well, for the price, it's pretty enjoyable.It's got a little singleplayer campaign that kinda teaches you what each ship can do, and gives you a strategic challenge, it's got your multiplayer, where you invite someone from the lobby, and you get to duke it out in space, and with its sandbox mode, you can mess around or play against another player locally, or against the AI. With the multiplayer, and sandbox mode, the game feels replayable. You can generate a nice map with ease, you can choose the amount of asteroids, crystals, and other features, however you want it.There are two races, each with a number of similar (but not exactly the same) ships, each filling the same role differently. The variety of the ships is large enough to give you a plenty of strategic options.The music, while repetitive after a while, is pretty nice to listen to during the gameplay, the sounds are just fine, and the GUI is pretty simple.It does have a few flaws, yes. For example, right now, you connect to the Lobby automatically, and people who are in the lobby as well can spam you with invites. Thankfully, the people that were online while I was trying this game out were considerate, and only sent one invite. When they got declined, they didn't send another, so I guess unless there's a braindead spammer among the players, you won't be bothered much, or at all.Some reviews also say the game feels like a mobile port, and well, I suppose that's true as well. That alone doesn't feel like a flaw to me however. If this were a game for mobile devices, however, it would be wonderful.I think the game is worth trying. It's cheap, and for an early access game, it really feels like a finished product. If you enjoy strategies, you could probably enjoy this. It's simple, yet complicated, and it can probably kill a few hours if you get into it."
76561198014681307,Recommended,411120,30798105,Posted: 28 March,all,Phred,"Unique turn based strategy. The map rotation is nice since like a galaxy the inner orbits rotate faster (shorter distance to go) and it make you anticipate where things will be moved relative to each other. There is a quick look at the next rotation that makes it a little easier to see/anticipate.As one reviewer noted it is an app port and works great so far.It seems only the map layouts (where rocks or resources are) may be random; everything else has fixed rules like chess, based on what type of piece it is.It has a nice variety of unit types and I've only seen six so far in the tutorial/campaign (solo) - which has been adding one new unit each . The camaign starts out simple but does get more and more complex as it goes along and new ships/features are added into the mix.At the current .50 cents sale price worth getting copies for your friends too."

,Recommended,411120,25440376,"Posted: 10 September, 2016",all,lesslucid,"This is rather a unique game. If you like this style of game, it certainly seems to be set at a bargain price. Basically, it's a turn-based tactical combat game set in a small, moving arena. Through the first dozen-odd levels, it seems to be constituted by a small but carefully balanced array of different spaceships; each ship is good for something, but no ship is absolutely dominant. The best ship is very expensive and can be quite readily be destroyed by a range of well-used, cheaper ships.However, once one gets even further into the campaing, one realises that there's a whole other array of weird and complicated ships to play with. Honestly, for me, at that point it started to feel less like a strategy game and more like a puzzle game. Understanding all of the different abilities of all the different ships, trying to keep track of what will happen with the movement of the arena in the next turn, and predicting the moves of the enemy, feels quite ""brain burning"", or conducive of a state of ""analysis paralysis"". So, for myself, it became less fun and more like work. But if you like tactical puzzles, these seem very well designed and they certainly give you a lot to think about!Finally, I think the multiplayer would probably help to make this more engaging... but in my experience of it so far, there never seems to be anyone else on when I am. So, a cautious thumbs-up... just be aware of what style of game it is you're getting into."

The only part that isn’t easily possible in the real world is the “spinning” of the board after each player’s turn (it would be possible to reproduce in the real world, but incredibly tedious).The AI in this game is not great: on a new level I found myself sometimes losing the first attempt simply because I got off to a slow start with the new concepts introduced. However, the second attempt was always a win because the AI is highly predictable and doesn’t exploit bad human choices about half the time.I haven’t yet gotten this played with a human opponent, which is a shame as it would seem the game is really focused on human versus human. This is a “recommended” only to those who really are into two player abstract board games."

The rotating board literally adds a fascinating twist to turn based tactics.If you love challenging and complex game play then this game is definitely for you. Yet the learning curve is fairly gentle. Play starts simply with the complexity slowly emerging as each new unit is added.Being early access there are rough edges of course, but there is already hours of quality entertainment to be enjoyed. This is truly an inspired little indie masterpiece in the making."

76561197969973054,Recommended,411120,22950525,"Posted: 13 May, 2016",all,Vonias,"Wow, this game is fun. Basically I had some money in my steam wallet and this looked interesting, so I picked it up, at first glance the UI looks like a mobile port, but the game works fine with mouse and runs really smooth on my PC, looks pretty good too when you have the graphics cranked up.Gameplay: This game is a turn based strategy game set in a solar system, unlike a lot of turn based space strategy games this game has no extra fluff, no CCG elements, no 4X style campaign mode, just a simple to learn, but suprisingly complex strategy game. The twist with this game is that everything on the map rotates around the center, although it seems like this wouldn't matter as relative positions would stay the same, that actually isn't true, because everything orbits at the same speed things closer to the center go around faster than things on the edge, these rotations really add new depth and it takes some time to get used to, but the devs have really taken advantage of this with delayed attacks and timed bombs that can take advantage of the orbiting system.Content: At the time of writing this review (5/13/2016) there are 2 races implimented into multiplayer, 1 campaign (combines humans and aliens, no story just kind of a tutorial and extra ai battles), 9 Human ships, 9 Alien Ships (kinda ten b/c aliens have a ship that can build nanobots), and a sandbox for you to test out new things or play hotseat on the same computer with your friends.There are some gameplay mechanics that I didn't go over like the resource system, but you can figure that out once you buy the game, oh, and by the way, BUY THE GAME.My ONLY major complaint is this game doesn't have enough players, so it can be hard to find a match online, but it's more fun to play against your friends and family anyway, so personally, I dont care as much, but if you want to be MLG and wreck everyone online, you might be a little dissapointed with the amount of people that go online on any given day.If I had to rate it with 5 being an average game, I would give Galaxy Admirals a 7/10, and that will only go up as the game moves further into development with the planned 3rd race coming out and further UI improvements. Good Luck Devs!"

If that gives me any merit with you continue reading.I got this games in the hopes of re-establishing control over my account. It had been so long since I made a Steam purchase that Steam was beginning to limit control over my account and the features I could use. Needless to say making this purchase did not help me, but what was discovered is priceless.Maybe I am in the dark here but I haven't encountered a game layout like Galaxy Admirals. The unique, almost boardgame style of it's maps are casual, yet engaging in strategic warfare tactics. The ""revolving star system"" you control your units in gives a style of gameplay similar to Chess and other boardgames where critical thinking, and foresight are key.The game is very colorful for the most part, if not leaning to the ""Blue"" spectrum a little too much. I would like to see different backgrounds for maps to offer a ""relief"" in tones. The graphics the game utilizes reminds me that of a Android game as well as it's control interface which in fact, can't be a bit quirky with the mouse. It almost seems like a game that should be native to Touch devices.The AI Campaign offers some fun, some frustration, and in the end satisfaction on completion. Giving you a boost to move into multiplayer and dominate the scene... however this is where I hit somewhat of a roadblock: Not many people actually play online yet. As a early access game with very little exposure you won't encounter many online yet. I hope this will change with more reviews and Steam-based promotion.In summary, I do suggest this game to other users that are fans of boardgames, turn based strategy games, and science fiction. Great job JetDogs Studios."
