Before COH there was this gem and in a lot of ways it was, and still is, superior:- great story mode- cool voice acting- pretty decent graphics w/ awesome animations- great soundtrackAlso, Nordic Games resurrected MULTIPLAYER - no Gamespy :)9.7/10(-0.3 for some very minor issues with the 'options.ini' file)"

The disastrous copy protection is gone. The graphics is bumped up to 1920 x 1080 at 144 Hz. The graphics are still good for 2016! Owning it on steam just makes sense. Loved it before and enjoying it again. And the fact that nobody are able to make a decent RTS nowadays made this a no brainer deal.

Ok the AFV models are excellent,interesting odd ball types of vehicles cammed up nicely and there is a T26B(with a radio,wow) and BA-32-2 and I  think a VZ semi track recovery vehicle.Amazing!They look and move really well.                                                          But the spoken chat is truly terrible.Thanks, minion,that is the 1000th time you have told me the enemy is sighted in your annoyingly poofie voice.Worse is that sticking an ""A""sound after an English word does not make it Italian.The acting in all three games is embarrasingly bad.                                                                                                                                       The maps are large enough and serve their purpose, they are OK.The missions are predictable but not silly.They are OK as well.The game itself looks old ,sure,but its clear and quite satisfactory.Battle sounds are fine.The music(part of the package) but obviously  not that stirring because I can not recollect any at all.Battles take  place at extremely close range.I know it's about scale but it just seems far too close..                                                                                                                                                              Apart from not running the opening scene unless you click,no problems ,glitches, slow load ups,or crashes, nah ,been none of that stuff. It runs fine on Windows 7x 64 bit.Its easy to find your way round the game and get into combat.             OK why the thumbs up? For me its  only  the interesting AFV which swings  that old digit upwards.There are much better games out there than this but this is ok. Not much else ;damned by faint praise perhaps...."

,Recommended,411310,21414303,"Posted: 23 February, 2016",all,SelfRatedPro,"This game is certainly one that I was super excited to see come to steam. This is a fantastic World War II based RTS game, that despite having a healthbar system for tank damage, has some advanced thought that was put into the tank fighting. The ability to capture enemy tanks and artillery is a nice feature. IN addition, it alows for players to play however they want, whether you want to be sneaky, or just spam the living hell out of tanks. Many ways to win, combine with a good soundtrack, simplicity of gameplay to make this one of the best RTS games that I can remember."
,Recommended,411310,21864629,"Posted: 15 March, 2016",all,Olden_bread,"It is a classic strategy in 2 parts. Phase 1 almost equal to Phase 2, the only thing Phase 2 have done is new missions and Italy + Yugoslavia. Story is very well written, panzers themselves are good realized. Infantry is a bit sucky (it always so in classics).Despite being released in 2004, the game is good alternative to that Company of Heroes 2 shame. Campaing is more interesting, game is harder (if you choose hard mode your losses will be unrestorable) and it doesnt want you to buy stuff like generals etc.PS Russian voices are not very good. Pronounciacion is fine, but phrases sometimes ugly."

Half of a century is my age and already play games since most of youngsters of the gaming community still weaning on a Pong game.To cut it short, Panzers Phase One is one of those rare gem of strategy games. Eventhough its graphics is already shown its old age, DirectX 9 is the correct term, still dazzle an Nvidia laptop.The con side of this game is when I placed troops sometimes it becomes so difficult to see.Forward, soldier! Hit that foxhole!"
,Recommended,411310,29149955,Posted: 9 January,all,Veilchenbeschleuniger,"One of my earliest and most favorite WWII Strategy Games, that I started playing when it was originally released. Every once in a while i used to install it. Now that it's available via steam i can rip the CD (thumbs down for not letting me register the retail version on steam ...)tip: if you have difficulty finishing an mission try Infantry Spam. It is absurd good since Sniper and Bazookas do ridicuoulos damage to infantry or tanks. Just equip them with binoculars, put some medics in betweeen them, some close combat troops and you're good!"

No idea what the problem was. I tried both windows 7 and windows 10 to play it but on neither would I ever get to the main menu. Turning dep off never solved the issue.

I bought the game, because they wrote it will work under this OS. Long story short the game does not run. I have the intro working fine, then it minimizes to the up-left corner of the screen. I ran it with XP SP3 compatibility, but that only made the mouse move. If you offer something to work under new OS, make it work. I wouldn't have bought it otherwise."

The Zoom level is one of the biggest problems. You can hardly see beyond your units to the enemy units that are firing at you. The AI always just bum rushes straight into your units and meelees. No tactics, nothing.PURE GARBAGE and I'm really sorry I did not refund this package, $29 wasted."

The product on the store shows the release date as february 2016, but it is the same exact game I already own in hard copy, box and all. I was expecting at least better textures, an actual real remastering of the panzer franchise. Instead, all I got was a the same game that now supports windows 10?Refunding."
