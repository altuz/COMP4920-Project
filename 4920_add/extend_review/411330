,Recommended,411330,21087153,"Posted: 9 February, 2016",all,Whiterabbit-uk,"OMG!  I've been waiting to see Men of Valor (MOV) released on Steam for years.  I even wrote to Valve some years ago  asking for it to be included because it has a surperb multiplayer game.  It's 11 years old now, so some  aspects are a little dated, but the actual maps are  excellent. Thankfully  the  original add-on map pack has been included,   expanding the original maps to 21 multiplayer maps.   Every major battle  from the American involvement in the Vietnam war is represented in these maps.   I do hope we see some  servers coming online soon  as there hasn't been any for a few years now, and then you only got a few players  at any one time, so some of the bigger maps were never included in the map roations.I actually purchased  15 hard copies of this game less than a month ago as I was planning to  get  friends involved in the game.  There is still one company renting servers for this game and I was thinking  of   renting a small server of perhaps 8 or 12 slots, but I may not need to now (hopefully).  It  used to be possible  to set up your own server via the game, but   I wasn't able to with my hard copies.  I purchased Steam versions   for both of my Steam  accounts, then set up  multiplayer server and WAS able to  join the server from my other account, so it looks like that part of the game has been fixed.   (Yeahhh!)The single player  missions are  brilliant.  I remember playing MOV  for the first time  when it was released  back in 2004 and really felt like I was on partol in Vietnam.   The first mission gave me an adrenalin rush as I swept across a field towards  forest,  then  creeping along  a narrow  clearing in the forest, avoiding traps only to be faced by  several enemy dug well in  was  exhilarating.  i'd never experienced  a FPS game quite like it up to this point.For those expecting a run and gun like game (COD, MOH etc) you'll be disappointed. You need to play the game as stealthily as you can, otherwise you'll quickly cop a bullet in the head if there are any enemy around.  Respawning is simply  a click of your mouse.  If you are wounded you have to  quickly bandage yourself otherwise you'll bleed out.  You can pick up  health packs and canteens from dead enemies and friendlies, both of which   fill up your  indicator that shows  how near to death you are.  You can also  pick up weapons and ammo from dead  enemy and friendlies as well, so you  rarely run out of ammo.The single player  campaign  follows  the multipler missions,  though  in the single player missions you do get to man a heavy  machine gun while flying around in  a Huey,  and steer a boat on a river. There are various mission types   that include  rescuing  downed pilots, freeing prisoners and  various recon patrols;  sadly,  apart from cut scenes, there's no vehicular  traffic  available in any of the missions, unlike the brilliant Battlefield series that was  running concurrently when this was first released (Battlefield Vietnam, another game i've been playing recently).  If I had to choose between the two I would have to pick Battlefield Vietnam  even though I think the graphics  for Men of Valor are better, because BFV had hundreds of custom maps  and loads of mods available, plus  you could  use   tanks, mobile artillery, jeeps,  and  various other vehicles including   choppers and jets.You do need to play this game with some stealth otherwise you won't get through the game.  A heat shot will kill you instantly, but   other parts of the body are recoverable by bandaging and  health packs.  The longer you leave bandaging, the lower your health becomes.The Jungle maps are   brilliant, and still look superb even now 11 years later.  It's not DX11, but   you still get   the atmosphere in most of the multiplayer  and sigle player maps.With 40% off the release price, this is a bargain.The only negative I remember about this game was  the  spawn camping♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that occured on some of the servers and  when you died, if you didn't click the respawn button, you could follow your killer around and see where he/she was, then creep up on then to kill them   in retribution for killing you; however, there were some good servers with   decent players  who would  kick  players who  spawn♥♥♥♥♥♥♥or played in an unfriendly manner.I'll update this review once I've had chance to revisit the game. apart from  a couple of the single player missions, which I played recently, I've not played the game much for several years.check out some of the videos over on You Tube.  Sadly I could only find one multipler match and the quality was appalling, so isn't worth  watching.  there are loads of single player  videos though.  The following   is over 5 hours long and shows many of the  missions available in the single player campaign.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mhpAxlqdQMedit:I  set up a server this evening and was able to play  with a friend, so  it is definitely possible to set up your own server. There  may be problems playing with friends who liv on different continents.  I seem to remember   if the Ping was over   150   you'd be lagging quite badly.   We did have a few freezes when starting   some  new games, but generally   the game  ran really well.  I'm over the moon  to  see this game  on Steam and hope  to see  loads of  community members playing the game in the not too distant future.  I also hope  to see  increased interest whenever the game    is on sale, so as to extend the life of this game for years to come.    There are much  better looking games out there now, especially with   game engines like Frostbite and Crytek  plus  the number of new releases may dampen the enthusiasm of some, but  for those who like a good game, that's fun to play and has lots of  great maps and the ability to set up your own server without having to rent one I'm sure  this will be a winner.   I'm  looking forward to  seeing some full servers;  most of the maps   are definitely much better when   12   are playing, but you can still have fun on the smaller maps with fewer  players."
,Recommended,411330,21577743,"Posted: 1 March, 2016",all,Dangerous Saiga,"I actually remembered playing this game on the original Xbox back when it came out in late 2004 and as I am writing down this review, I still have my physical copy of the Xbox version right here in front of me. I absolutely love this game as I played the campaign over and over again that I lost count. You may be wondering: What’s so special about this game? Well, I am going to tell you.Men of Valor is a 2004 PC (and original Xbox) first-person military shooter that takes place in the earlier stages of the Vietnam War (1965-1968). You play as Dean Shepard, an African-American soldier who took part in the conflict alongside with his squadmates: Greaser, Smooth, Zook, Hodges, and all other characters (Oh my goodness, I even remembered those characters from long ago). The game does not have a legitimate plot but what I love about this game is the presentation. Men of Valor provides a great historical perspective and experience, placing the player to know what is like in that conflict. The campaign is divided into four different areas of the war in 1965-1968: Da Nang Outskirts (rooting out the Vietcong from Da Nang, taking part in Operation Starlite), Iron Triangle (eliminate the Vietcong stronghold that resides in northern Saigon and being part of the joint US-ARVN Offensive), Khe Sanh Hill (push the North Vietnamese Army away from U.S hilltops firebases in 1967), and the Tet Offensive (terminate the North Vietnamese positions out of Hue and breaking the Siege of Khe Sanh).The game also presents a two minute “documentary” (think of it like the ‘classic’ History Channel documentary) that tells general information about the event you are about to take in. The loading screen provides photographs of the Vietnam War as well as general information about the war, including notable quotes from the leaders in both sides of the conflict. The graphics are a bit dated today, but the gameplay is absolutely breathtaking and highly immersive. The sound effects are amazing, especially with the incoming mortars blasting on the ground or in debris. The voice acting for the Army Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), Vietcong, and NVA are highly authentic, legitimate (actual Vietnamese voice actors not those ‘fake’ ones like in the 80s and early 90s films), and impressive. The aiming animation is not looking down on the iron sight, but rather ‘leaning’ (think of Battlefield 1942 and Battlefield: Vietnam). There is absolutely no health regeneration and if you get shot, you have to hold down the bandage button to stop the bleeding (there are medkits and canteens laying around in the map or from dead enemy soldiers).The best part about this game is the soundtrack and music from Inon Zur (the composer who did the first Crysis game, Dragon Age: Origins, Fallout 3 and 4, and other notable music). His music in the game is astonishing, immersive, and majestic. Arguably, his music in Men of Valor was a stepping stone from him to compose music in popular video games that we have today.The only negative aspects about the game is that you will get killed. A lot. The game sort of cheats when it comes from the enemy shooting at you from nowhere even when you take complete cover. The second half of the game is a bit punishing since you will get shot at from all directions and you’ll have to move slowly, inch by inch. The resolutions for the game is 4:3 primarily because the game is an oldie, but a classic. Putting on higher resolutions might be problematic but might be solvable.Men of Valor was a Vietnam War game that was often overlooked by EA Games’ Battlefield: Vietnam, Vietcong game, Shellshock: Nam, and Conflict: Vietnam. However, Men of Valor was also a “testing” game in the gaming industry to see if gamers and developers are willing to tolerate to have a Vietnam War game in the market that was greatly overwhelmed by World War II games (like Medal of Honor and the original Call of Duty – the 2003 version). Nowadays, modern gamers know about Call of Duty: Black Ops (for the Vietnam sections) and Bad Company 2: Vietnam as the well-known video game titles for that conflict. I never regret for having Men of Valor on the original Xbox and enjoying the campaign over and over again. I am very glad that the game is now on Steam and I strongly recommend this game to any person who is interested about the Vietnam War in a historical perspective because this game actually did an impressive job."

It's a classic FPS - You are a US-Marine, who faces the cruelties of the early Vietnam War in 1965.The controls are easy ( I miss the Iron sights though), the voice acting is cool, and the cutscenes are peppered with original shoots from the war.As a big surprise for an old game (which is released on Steam after a decade), this one runs stable on modern PCs.A definite recommendation for shooterfans!"

I could barely try and scratch the surface back when it was about a year old, but i do remember it.Some Yay and Nay :Positive stuff -* Vietnam War shooter, yes please and give us seconds. There needs to be more of them.*Famous Voice Actors such as Steve Blum and Michael Gough providing good soldier voices.* Time accurate Weapon arsenal progresses throughout the war, as you start out in '65 with the 7.62 Nato Raifu M14 and the M1 Thompson which sooner or later will be phased out by the M16A1 (unfortunate in my opinion)* Surprising, but accuratly, the game has female NVA inviduals. I have yet seen a Vietnam game than this game have that.* While you rarely hear them, you can hear classic 'nam songs such as ""Wooly Bully"" at certain US controlled areas and vechicles.*  Fun if very simple. It's like a blend of Medal of Honor: Allied Assault and tiny fragments of Ghost Recon (don't ask)* Hard, but fair health System. You get shot, you hold <button> to stop the bleeding and then you need to find/loot for canteens and or Medkits to regain your health. No silly health regen here, private Pyle!*First thing you do is throwing an american football with your squad at the base. A fine detail.Neutral:* The AI on the US team can sometimes be quite dumb as it can be quite helpful. They will never die (although they can be temporarily buzzed down). They can dissable NVA traps aswell, but you mostly work around them before they can react. Sometimes they can go Colonel James Braddock on their enemies and clear out a whole bunch of them before you can say ""Jelly Donut.""*As expected, munition for the US weaponry are scarse (somtimes found in crates) and you are sometimes forced to loot an NVA invidual's body for a weapon. Luckily you have up to four weapon slots, which grenades also take up.*NVA inviduals can sometimes be dumb as balls as they can sometimes be your worst nightmare.*Pistols are gained further in the game, unfortunatly. Not a neccesity, but a fine luxury. ( I love the M1911A1)The Negative* No jump button. You will never be required to jump in this game, but it happened to me that i get stuck between a few rocks or similar situations and i can't get out. No jump function means i have to reload to my previous point.* Animations are really strange and or delayed on your teammates. Not a huge thing, but ugly as hell.* Overly aggressive AI with slightly overpowered weapons. I played it on Medium and expected a fair fight, i'm stuck on a level where i can't get out of a Rat hole without being mowed down by a machinegun goof.  You are sometimes forced to get extremely close with certain weapons and they can mow you down easily. Therefore i stopped playing because i'm literally stuck.*Melee bashes are utterly worthless. I had to bash a guy for fifty (three) bashes. He could land a shot on me between each one too. The SKS however has a bayonet, but i never use it.* There are times you will be forced to attack with an MG from a chopper, you won't gain any health during this and the NVA shoots like pros.*Some levels have a weird FPS drop. And if you encounter a stuttering fps/lag drop early on, look up the v-sync fix on the discussion list to disable it. Quick and easy.*Graphical misses by the developers, such as the Maxim 1910 and the world model for the M60 not having any ammo belt.And so forth, i've likely missed a lot of points on all three bases up there but there you have it.Do i recommend this game?  Yes, i do.Keep in mind that this is a fairly old, fairly cheap made, difficult FPS with glitches and bugs here and there, but if you can look away from that, you'll get a good treat of this Vietnam war gem.There needs to be more Vietnam games (especially on steam) and this is a start until Tripwire get their slow butts off Killing Floor II and make Rising Storm II: Vietnam. (Hopefully not on Early Access.)9,99€ (Ten bucks?) isn't bad at all and you'll get a good kick out of this. Go for it my friend.Hope you get what you wanted with this review!This review dosn't suck...it blows."
,Recommended,411330,32282832,Posted: 8 June,all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"Men of Valor is one of those rare first-person shooter titles that takes place during the Vietnam War circa 1965. Many of the reviews for this title on Steam are negative, primarily because of the hard difficulty of the game, as well as the fact that this title has some problems getting started. Before we go any further into this review, Men of Valor will not appear when launched, you must press CTRL + ALT to get the window to show, and then CTRL + Enter to go full screen. There's also a handy guide in the community hub that will help you eliminate the stuttering issue that the game has by simply editing out the vsync option in the .ini file. If you can handle those minimal tasks then read on, as Men of Valor is a pretty decent FPS overall.You play as an inexperienced African-American Marine named Dean who has been assigned to the 3rd Battalion of the 3rd Marine Division. It's important to note the main character's skin color, as given the year that the game takes place in, it's a prominent and recurring theme. All in all, you will battle your way through sixteen missions in total, through a number of locations that range from dense, thick jungles, to underground tunnels, and urban landscapes. Men of Valor is laden with true-to-life historical locations and battles that took place in Vietnam during 1965, including what happened at the height of the Tet Offensive.Now, as far as difficulty goes, this game can be frustratingly hard at some points. Though there are three difficulty settings outlined in the menu, for some reason only medium can be played; this is most likely a bug in the port that the developer never issued a patch for. The damage that you take is high, and going toe-to-toe with any enemy is almost always a guaranteed death. A death is almost always a guaranteed restart to the beginning of the level as well, as checkpoints are few and far between and there are no manual saves. Luckily, each mission is rather short, so when you are forced to give it another go from the beginning it isn't detrimental to your overall progress.Some more elements that add to the difficulty factor of Men of Valor are the health and healing system, as well as searching bodies. Your health is indicated by a medical sign in the bottom left corner of the screen, and when you are hit you start ""bleeding"", any blood lost will then become permanent damage, which is indicated in a dark red on the same medallion. To stop the bleeding, you have to bandage yourself by pressing F; the sooner the better, as the more blood you lose, the more permanent damage you incur. To recover permanent damage, you have to find med-kits and canteens on dead bodies by searching them, which requires holding down the spacebar for a length of time. It's rather time consuming, and in some cases can put you in more danger than it's worth, but that's just another ingredient that makes the title more realistic.For a game from 2004, the graphics aren't half bad. The character models are a little blocky, but there's a good variety of enemies and your squad-mates are easily defined from the generic soldiers that are scattered about. The environments are very well detailed, with lush forestry, reflective water, devastating fires, and atmospheric mist. In particular, the final level is extremely graphic, as bombs that are going off in the distance look like lightning strikes. The soundtrack is also decent, as it's heavily cinematic and ensures that your heart stays racing from the very first battle, to the very last.Even though it has some issues getting started on more modern systems, Men of Valor is an excellent FPS title. Moreover, it adds to its already unique setting by centering around an African-American Marine, which was uncommon back in 1965, when every minority was heavily discriminated against. The historical accuracy of the battles and locations is just another added factor to the in-depth care that went to crafting this title. It's a tough one, but if you don't mind the challenge then Men of Valor will be sure to scratch an itch that's been unreachable for a long time.Rating:4.0/5.0- Excellent, highly worth playing.Is This FPS Any Good?Curator|GroupClick for More"

It's like Battlefield in the sense about the weapons detail, the environment and the cutscenes. Call of Duty in the sense that none of your allies help you and never die, plus it's always two or three soldiers taking on an entire army just like CoD. It's still a great game in it's own right, so I'd give it 8/10.(The first is a variation of a quote from Amadeus)"
,Recommended,411330,24280711,"Posted: 12 July, 2016",all,Rattlesnake8,"Men of Valor is an older fps set during the Vietnam War. The graphics, sound and feel of the game is dated, however, MoV is an enjoyable, challenging shooter which is worth picking up if you start the game up knowing it is over 10 years old. If you played the original Call of Duty or Medal Honor then this is similar.The Vietnam setting is what really helps this game stand out as there is a severe lack of games set during the Vietnam War. You will fight in the rice paddies, patrol through the jungle and constantly be on the look out for enemies and booby traps.The game works great on current PC's and on Windows 8.1 so if you are looking for an enjoyable old school shooter then pick this one up when it's on sale."

,Not Recommended,411330,28636548,"Posted: 25 December, 2016",all,InnerConflict,"It becomes clear to me why this game drowned when it first came out in 2004. I wanted to love it, but here is why I couldn´t:I love vietnam shooters and I would say this here is the second best out there in terms of the First Person Shooter genre. But it has some incredible major flaws in its design and sadly proofs why the vietnam era of games never caught on to be a prime of the FPS genre.I play on my Win XP rig for authenticity reasons so I can´t give any insight of what issues this game has on modern systems.Let´s start.Length, Story, Sound and Presentation:It´s pretty short to begin with if you play it quickly and don´t die too often. You have 13 missions which I each finished in roughly 30 mins. If you have good aim and know your FPS games, you run through this pretty quickly.Graphicswise the game was ok in 2004, it had all you wished for, a nice jungle environment for example, but I gotta say the animations in the cutscenes are bugged and break immersion, as well as the sound design. While the animations are too fast or too abrupt and buggy when transitioning stances, the sounds often are of different quality, sometimes high quality sounds and then low quality appear next to each other in the effects or voice department, such as marines shouting or explosions. Gun sounds are beefy and done nicely, obviously with most of the sound budget going in there, the rest doesn´t stand out and often even falls too short in terms of quality and atmosphere. Between missions you get characterization in form of letters written from your dad to you and you to your parents with reports of thoughts and what´s going on. Typical war letters which explain situations at home and with your characters streams of thoughts. You play the generic black marine called Dean Shepard. A real story as in cutscenes or plot doesn´t exist. You simply play missions as experiences of an marine. I wasn´t immersed enough to care in terms of story sadly. Vegetation is thick and animated and it feels like jungle even though the corridors are quite obvious. Vietcong gave you a more open feel, sometimes literally being semi open world compared to Men of Valor, and you can feel vietnam shouldn´t be treated to much like a corridor. MoV is straight up widened up corridors and sometimes straight up corridors leading to your objectives. Cutscenes in between chapters are historical flicks presenting information about the vietnam war and your next area of operation. From Khe Sanh to the Tet Offensive. Loading screens are presented with president´s quotes etc. It feels pretty pretentious given that the characters are uncanny valley.Gameplay, Gunplay, AI, etc.:Your squadmates can shoot and move. That´s about it. They have names you forget as the presentation and story can´t keep you thrilled enough to give a s  h  i  t  nor should you. The enemy AI is artificially difficult. They often run past you or keep an blind eye to their path finding or they straight up aimbot you. It happens only occasionally but can get annoying in the worst scenarios, same goes for your squadmates. I´ve seen that hodges guy run past enemy lines too often to care anymore. You can´t give em commands like in vietcong, taking control out of your hands in this game. The guns feel different from many other corridor FPS´s and are fun to shoot with decent animations and models for the time. Objectives are repetitive and barely change from what you see in the first few missions. There are a few decent missions where objectives feel fresh and so does level design, but that is done in the first third of the game and barely ever comes back.At the second half of the game most spawnpoints in the world are set to solely make you ragequit. You have to carefully advance otherwise you trigger enemy spawns and enemies just spawn all around you and you are cucked without the support of your squadmates. Some buildings have collision detection issues, so do some rocks and enemies themselves. Thankfully barely any trees have. Meaning even when cowering like a   m  o  t  h  e r  f  u  c  k  e  r   behind your rock while you can see the enemy, you can´t hit him as you shoot the rock instead. Sadly you don´t notice it easily, because of the lack of decals such, as bulletholes, which make it hard to get bullet feedback. The enemies themselves give feedback when hit, such with animations and blood, except when in a running animation, in which they barely react at all to your shots but still get hurt.Another issue is movement speed. You either snail walk or you jog, which is your standard fastest speed and it´s infuriating in dire situations! Make sure you play by the games rules as you can´t jump either and looting enemies takes 2 secs if you can even reach them without running into the enemy directly. You can run out of ammo as well, which means reloading the last checkpoint. You can´t quicksave! So you have to rely on these quite widely spread checkpoints. Which isn´t bad, but not good either.Some guns have different values as others, the most effective ones are semi auto high caliber rifles such as the SKS and M14, while the M16, CAR 15, Type 56, AK47, RPD, M60, Scoped Mosin and M21, Thompson M1, PPSh 41, are mediocre at best. Many guns are low in terms of accuracy when standing and require you to shoot from a crouching or lying position to enhance your chances of survival, but the sad thing about that is that due to the jungle environment, crouching and lying basically renders you an idiot, as you can´t spot any enemy anymore deu to the high grass! DUH. So using the semi auto modes on those guns is key to survival generally. A deep cut in fun by stupid game design.Another stupid game design was the aiming and leaning feature. If you aim with your gun you can´t strafe, instead you lean left or right. There are no iron sights, just a zoom with your crosshair. If you manage to adopt to that system, congrats, otherwise you will curse the game designers. You have an option for enabling loose aimpoint, aka rail shooter fixed camera with moveable gun and crosshair, but that´s just for personal preference anyway.You can´t choose anything besides medium difficulty unless you played the game once, or at least I think that was a bug in my game... I really can´t figure it out. In terms of difficulty balancing the game is f  u  c  k  e  d either. Headshots gets them down pretty easily while everything else is basically the same damage multi. 3 shots in the toes is the same as 3 in the back with most machine guns. Only semi auto only guns with higher caliber are different. They are often 1 hit headshot or 2 hit body shot depending on enemy type. Damage inflicted on you however is broken. You either take small chunks of health when hit or half of it directly which leaves you swearing again and most enemies have the same 7.62 ammo or guns. For health you collect canteens from looting enemies and rarely you find medic kits laying around. If you are hit you need to hold the bandage button so you don´t bleed out too quickly. You can basically restore most of the lost health from the gunshot by doing that, as it fills up the medicus that serves as a health indicator on the left down corner of your screen.Conclusion:Repetitive, mediocre, flawed designs, unimpressive vietnam game by the leftovers of the game stuiod 2015. It´s more of an Original Xbox diamond than a PC diamond. A decent shooter with a nice promise but mediocre execution. I can not recommend it to anyone who isn´t an FPS veteran, or someone who loves vietnam era games or does care for the things said above."

While the gameplay is standard fare for early 2000s FPS games it doesn't really detract from it too much. An added bonus is the setting, you don't exactly get many of FPS shooters set in the Vietnam War, granted it was the most unpopular conflict in US History but I digress. Off the top of my head I can only think of three FPS games that take place entirely in the war that have gained some level of popularity: Vietcong, Battlefield Vietnam, and Battlefield Bad Company 2: Vietnam. I think this can definitely join that mental list."

So take what I say with a grain of salt.Performance Issues (Just an FYI): Running this game at 1920x1080 in fullscreen mode caused the frame rate to stutter at an uplayable rate.  For reference I am running a GTX 970, a 3.4GHZ i5, and 8GB of ram on Windows 7 64bit.  It feels as if there was no optimizations made for current gen hardware.   I play the game in widowed mode at 1280x1024 and it runs smoothly.  I realize this is not something a lot of people want to do - so if this not acceptable you might want to try something else.Pros: Good atmosphere - jungle sounds/graphics hold up fairly well.  This not Crysis with layers of mods that will make your eyes bleed - but it gets the job done.  It uses an interesting tranisition from briefings to gameplay in which photographs slowly enlarge to become the gameplay screen.  Weapons feel realistic - I have shot old Soviet SKS rifles quite a bit and it sounds very close to the real thing.  Friendly AI is so-so.  Sometimes they will take down enemy soldiers, sometimes they will let them run by unscathed (stuff that was not that uncommon in games of this era).Cons: Checkpoint save system is not forgiving.  Don't expect to re-start from were you died a few moments ago.  In game actions like planting C4 can glitch out at the critical moment as you search for the perfect spot to activate it. Character models are ok - but on the blocky side.  Character animations can be very stiff - like the animator forgot to put in a few animations.  Bleeding system takes a bit to get used to and damage is very high.  If you are used to playing the older rainbow six games where a few bullets kill you will be right at home, especially when the game is set to hard."

The music is fine , the sounds superb; jets rumbling  in the distance,Hueys making that sound that only Hueys make as they clatter by out of sight.Screeching birds,incoming fire ,the pig sounding real slow,450 rpm,the SKS and the  AK47 completely right,the AK even shoots high,which they did, its all very very well done.Ok the combat is a bit easy but thats better than being too hard.This is after all a game.I've only played it a short while (getting a bit tense,needed a break,even made me feel like I needed a ciggie and I haven't smoked in years, it's that good, a bit real) but no glitches , crashes or silly stuff.

I've heard some good things about this game, but never got to experience it. This game, along with Vietcong, are two games on my list I've wanted to play for quite some time as they deal with a very controversial moment in not only American history, but world history at that. Overall, it feels very satisfying to shoot enemies, move around in the levels, and call in airstrikes. The controls are pretty responsive, the hit detection is pretty narrowed in, which is nice. The levels are nice and lengthy, while also presenting a challenge even on Easy difficulty. The bleedout mechanic is a welcome feature for realism and immersion. Your squadmates are all pretty unique, with interesting quotes and viewpoints. I have had one CTD so far, in the middle of the first mission of the second campaign, ""Iron Triangle"". So watch out for that. But other than that, the game has run at a smooth framerate consistently and supports higher resolutions as well. It's a solid port, as far as older games go. It's a recommended buy right now, while it's still on sale, and even afterwards, if you feel like spending a whopping 10 dollars on a classic. Good to see the older games making a resurgence. G.I. Number One!"

MoV has the same feel and graphics. There are some differences, but by and large, the gamplay feels the same. The health system is different (there are no medics, but plenty of canteens and medical kits available).From crouching balls deep in a swamp at night to crossing a bullet swept street in Hue, this game covers it all. You will watch your buddies die in front of you. You will burn a village (but the media makes you look bad for doing it). You will have to kill. You will look into the depths of hell and keep moving. You will die in this game, and your parents will receive a letter from your commanding officer about how you went out (while it is not instant death and back playing, there is some time in-between, but not much). You will come to love this game.Aiming is clunky. You cannot move while ADS, but you can lean. This allows you to peak around cover. I saw a few complaints that bullets come from random places in the tree line. That is true, but hit the deck and you'll be ok. Find cover as well. If bullets are flying in from nowhere, there is probably an enemy hanging around that you need to kill. Kill them, and the firing will stop. Enemy do spawn out of the jungle. But shocker, the screaming yellow ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s appear from out of nowhere, just like real life.Do you job, keep your head down, and don't try to be Rambo. Work with your squad and listen to them. They may not be good shots, but they know when something might happen, and they know where to run when Charlie get's you pinned.I cannot give this game a higher reccommendation. Best of luck!

The most agrivating part of this title is just poor level design and terrible AI. Nothing says fun like having random enemy spawns and then having that same enemy insta-kill you... on easy difficulty. Your AI squadmates like to run in front of you as you're firing and do nothing besides act as a bullet sponges (even worse than in most games). Ammo is scarse on some missions and abundent on others, with no real pattern or reasoning (you can take guns from the enemy, but the drop rate is oddly skewed). While I understand and like the emphasis on trying to replicate what fighting Vietnam was there needs to be a line drawn between that and playablity. There are entire missions where the player is forced to cross large empty fields with enemies surrounding them. Clearing villages doesn't fare any better as dozens of enemies will come pour out of one shack... even after you have pushed past it and your squadmates are standing out front. I did enjoy the story telling, when I could experience it, but it was a struggle to follow after continually replaying sections. If this game is cheap and you love 00's fps games then might as well try it but at $10 it is definately not worth it."

By the way, I tried various resolutions on my computer and it was the same result.Steam seriously needs to put more pressure on these developers to release better quality products. I'll probably get it on GOG or something.I must say, I did manage to play it in Windowed mode, and then my saved games disappeared. Yeah, that was the last straw.

The base gameplay is ok but it really isn’t anything that special. However due to poor enemy placement and a lack of any sort of quick save feature the game can be very frustrating. Enemies are often very hard to see, and even sometimes spawn in behind you. There is some fun to be had with the game when you aren’t being constantly pinned down by unknown assailants but like I said before the just OK gameplay gets tiresome after awhile.

And with the news footage telling the story and voiced letters of the character you play sandwiching the beginning and end of each level the game makes a decent first impression.Afterwards though you realize the game has a lot of issues - you will die a lot, due to frustrating random spawns from enemies. Most enemies have perfect aim and do loads of damage even on normal difficulty and the combat and movement is really clunky feeling, not smooth like a HL1 or similar games (almost like controlling a tank or something).I would only recommend this game for diehard fans of the Vietnam war, that also like videogames (there are not a lot of those to choose from etc). But for me however, honestly this game was kind of a let down. I would not recommend it for the average person looking from some FPS fun.P.S. OH I almost forgot - the game was so difficult at some point that I bumped the difficulty down to easy. But the enemies were still gunning me down in seconds so I ended up using cheats to get through the game at my own pace.For those interested - when you're in a level hit the TAB key and then type ""dinkydau"" without the quotes. You will need to type this for every level and after each loading screen but it turns ON/OFF Godmode. Hope this helps!"

Don't expect a Spec Ops: The Line experience, but you're also not playing Rambo. Instead, expect intense firefights and a heavy dose of 'Nam atmosphere.Men of Valor is definitely an old-school shooter, either. Don't expect to magically heal up just by standing there - you'll need to collect health packs to magically heal up. Enemies tend to appear in the same places, which is actually a good thing - the game is punishing in difficulty, so you'll get to die and restart a lot. It's also not for sissies with little patience - checkpoints are few and far between and Men of Valor laughs at the idea of a quicksave. Get used to running part of the same level over...and over...and over again.That said, it's still a great game and one that deals with a little-explored subject matter. It's well worth a play if you like shooters, or if you have an interest in the Vietnam war (just make sure to dial down the difficulty if you aren't a shooter fan).11/10 Would rage quit the Vietnam War after trying fifteen times in a row to get past the same ruined village"
