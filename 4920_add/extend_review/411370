,Recommended,411370,22526778,"Posted: 19 April, 2016",all,MrValdez,"I play a lot of fighting games. But if there's one game I will take to a deserted island, it would be Melty Blood. Me and my siblings have been playing this for ~13 years.Originally released in December 2002, this is a visual novel that happened to have a fighting game minigame. This was long before BlazBlue introduced the idea to the mainstream. The game's story is a continuation of Tsukihime and (surprisingly), is canon and explains how dead characters returned to life to fight with the small roster.The original game was broken. A lot of moves have shield frames (meaning, if this move hits another move, no damage is done but you can cancel to a different move) which lead to anime-esque fights with freeze frames everywhere as players switch moves to try to break through. Also, the post-victory screen will not end until the defeated character is on the ground. Meaning, if you killed your opponent while they're on the air, you can juggle them almost infinitely before the round will officially end (like other airdashers, the longer a combo is, the heavier the opponent becomes).Regardless, this game has a lot of innovations. Some of them are:- This game has 3 buttons and a dedicated shield button (think of it like Street Fighter V Ryu's parry but you can cancel to other moves) - which makes each character easy to play.- Melty Blood has no chip death making to exciting matches.- Characters can use their meter to gain a new gauge (called HEAT) that slowly goes down. During this time, the character regenerates life AND stops the clock. This makes the timer an important resource to manage. It is common for a player to stop the clock when its almost over and run away (or rushdown) to maintain the lead.- Super moves on a successful parry during HEAT.Later expansions in the series include Re-ACT (PC), ReACT Final Tuned (PC), Act Cadenza (Arcade), Act Cadenza Ver.B (PS2), Act Cadenza Ver.B (PC), Actress Again (PC), Actress Again Current Code (PC). ...if you think Street Fighter's naming convention is crazy, French Bread has taken it to the extreme.The game released on Steam will have the following features:- More characters! There are now 31 characters.- Each character have 3 different fighting style which each plays completely different. Effectively, this game has 31 multiply by 3 characters- Balance- Updated story (very important for those who wanted more Tsukihime)This game is so popular that it was referenced in the Type-Moon fan-service OVA, Carnival Phantasm.The Melty Blood fighting community love this game so much, that we have no problem playing the grand finals at a parking lot or airport lounge. This is how dedicated we are to this game.If you haven't played this gem and you love fighting games, give Melty Blood a shot. Who knows? Maybe you'll be airdashing with the rest of us for the next 13 years."

Yay.I've owned every entry in this series, and already imported the PS2 and PC versions of this game years ago, but being able to buy it without all that importing business... I feel like I'm dreaming.And they FINALLY figured out an elegant way to account for widescreen aspect ratios with this totally-not-designed-for-it game instead of just stretching everything out.Speaking of this first ever official English translation... it's scary how close to my old amateur fan translations from 8 years ago this is. I almost feel like I might have actually known what I was doing when I made them.Alright, I'm gonna take my glasses off and go stab some vampires to celebrate.P.S.

76561198078301154,Recommended,411370,23392691,"Posted: 4 June, 2016",all,YukariYakumo7,"*EDIT AS OF 03-20-2017*As something worth mentioning, the netcode has been VASTLY improved as of the current edit, and is actually freaking playable now with little input lag. It took about eight months after the game came out (December patch had it included, I believe), but the game finally has netcode worth playing online over now.I remember about four years ago, Melty Blood Actress Again Current Code (for the rest of this review will be listed as MBAACC for convience's sake) was released on PC and included as a bonus for those who bought the third blu-ray set for ""Carnival Phantasm"". It so happened that a friend of mine at school somehow managed to pool together funds for the set and bought it, with the sole intention of installing the game on everyone's computers and fun was had for the last few months of our school life. I never thought that MBAACC would ever make it to the West, much less on something like Steam, so when I heard that it was releasing late April of 2016, I was ecstatic to say the least. Well, how well does the NA region version fare with the original packaged version? Well, continue reading to find out!For what started off as a spin-off doujin fighting game of Type-MOON's Visual Novel, Tsukhime, the series has certainly evolved and gotten better (not every character has an infinite combo any more, for example). The general story for the game typically involves the strange mist that has covered the town and changes people who enter it, but for each character, there are either slight changes to the story or it covers a character that is dead in the Tsukihime universe, such as Roa and Kouma Kishibe and for what purpose they are alive again. The story can be pretty nonesensical, even if you have knowledge of the game MBAACC is based off of, but it's certainly entertaining to say the least. My biggest qualm with it is that a lot of the references and character interactions will more than likely be lost on someone who has absolutely no knowledge of the game or its VN original, but with games like these, the story isn't exactly what you play it for. I'm also a little irked on how the translation for the game is; it commonly swaps between using the original Japanese honorifics (i.e, Kohaku sometimes referring to Akiha as ""Akiha-sama"" at time, but in other moments with the exact same line spoken in Japanese, it'll swap out to ""Master Akiha"".) Some the text also has some wierder choice of words for a coresponding situation, but alas, it's not too big of a deal in the big picture, I'm just very picky when it comes to translation quality and it shouldn't affect someone else's enjoyment.While the graphics aren't exactly the best for a port of an Arcade game, it certainly isn't the worst looking fighting game out there but it is definitely dated by today's standards. While the in-game graphics are okay, the character portraits look nice and can be fairly comical during the Win screens and Story Mode, which is a nice addition to any game, much less MBAACC. The music for the game is absolutely phenomenal, and Raito deserves all the praise he can get for creating one of the best fighting game soundtracks I've ever heard; It's right up there with Guilty Gear and Touhou HIsouten - Scarlet Weather Rhapsody as one of my favorite fighting game OSTs. MBAACC runs very smoothly, without any frame dip and is one of the most fluid fighting games I've ever played. Now, when you start up one of the various play modes, you'll probably notice once you pick a character it gives you an option for ""Crescent Moon"", Half Moon"" or ""Full Moon"" playstyles. Each playstyle is unique and not only gives each character certain abilities (like Crescent Moon allowing for ""Reverse Beat"" hits and the ability to go into a frenzied ""Blood Heat"" mode with enough gauge and conditions fufillled, Half Moon giving more block priorities and Full Moon allowing you to CHARGE UP your Heat Gauge), they also change the move set for each character. Let's use the character Archetype;Earth, for example. With the CM playstyle, she has a ground projectile that faces its longer side away from the player to hit opponents in the front, but with the FM playstyle, said projectile changes direction when used and points itself towards the person using it, as to hit an opponent from behind. The playstyles in this game are what make MBAACC so unique compared to other fighters, and it's very fun to try out all of the various playstyles and see what works best for each player, as opposed to being locked into one moveset that may or may not be very efficient. Each character also has a shield skill that if timed right, can negate most opponent's attacks, give yourself gauge to use AGAINST them, and if you have Blood Heat active, can be turned into a devastating attack that deals massive ammounts of damage to your opponent. Think if Exdeath's ""Omniblock"" skill had an instant EX burst attached to it, and that's what shielding in this game can do.In closing, I love Melty Blood Actress Again Current Code to almost the fullest ammount I can, even with the issues I've stated before. I regard this game as much as I do Touhou Hisoutensoku (which is also a PHENOMINAL game), and it will forever be one of my favorite games of all time. Do I recommend this? As much as humanly possible.Pros:- Fluid mechanics- ""Moon"" style makes every character feel like three different characters, giving added fun- Amazing music- Controls are very easy to learn, but hard to master- Can use controller or keyboard to play, which is always lovely- Large cast of charactersCons:- Somewhat iffy translation- The game has difficulty spikes in story mode that can really put off a player from playing- Story mode can be confusing to people who have no knowledge of TsukihimeI hope you all enjoy this game as much as I have!"

,Recommended,411370,22526645,"Posted: 19 April, 2016",all,ajshell1,"Don't be fooled by my small playtime. I've actually played this game quite a bit before it's official english relase.I have to say, this is one of the best fighting games I've ever played. It takes characters from the Tsukihime visual novel (THERE IS NO TSUKIHIME ANIME), as well as one character from Kara No Kyoukai, and puts them in a fighting game. Since I had already played Tsukihime, I am definitely a bit biased, as I am already quite invested in these characters. But despite that. I'm willing to reccomend it as a very good fighting game.Here are some questions that you may have for the game.Q: How does this differ from the Japanese release of MBAACC wtih Mirror Moon's english patch?A: There are several improvements. Firstly, Mirror Moon was not able to finish the translations of some of the character's story arcade modes. This includes Nanaya Shiki, Roa, and a few others. In addition, this version offers controller configuration and keyboard configuration within the game's option menu. In the original release of the game, keyboard configuration was done in a separate, non-translated .exe. Also, pressing the escape key won't immediately cause the game to exit, like it does in the orignal. This version also lists the combos on the side panels.Q: The store page says that this is the final episode of a series. Do I need to play the previous episodes?A: That depends. If you only interested in the fighting part of this fighting game, you only need this game, as it is superior to all previous versions in term of fighting mechanics. However, playing at least the first game in the series (Melty Blood) is essential to understanding the storyline of this game, and anyone who hasn't played Tsukihime will be COMPLETELY lost. However, the fighting mechanics in the original Melty Blood are a bit....crap in comparison to this game. In addition, the original Melty Blood featured a story-to-combat ratio of at least 10:1, maybe as high as 30:1.Q: How's the translation?A: I haven't played the arcade mode for very long, but what I've seen appears to be good enough. I'll update this later after I've seen more. I might even upload some screenshot comparisons if i can be bothered.Q: I don't know anything about Tsukihime. However, I like Guitly Gear and BlazBlue. Will I like this?A: Yes. MBAACC uses the three-button attack sytem of Guilty Gear and BlazBlue, so any player of these games should feel right at home in this one. Heck, I'd argue that this games is BETTER than Guilty Gear XX and BlazBlue Calamity Trigger. However, as I mentioned previously, I may be a bit biased.Overall, I recommend this game to fighting game fans and fans of Type-Moon. I also recommend this to people who already ""own"" a copy of the Japanese version.This review is dedicated to Miyu Matsuki, the voice actor of Hisui who is sadly no longer with us."

On the other hand if you're willing to study and learn fromexternalresources things like moon stances, bnb (bread'n'butter in fighting game slang) and general attack strings of all characters, frame times, etc you will enjoy the deepness of Melty Blood combat system and the game as a whole.Melty Blood is one of the best fighting games (thinking eSport wise) of the past decade(s) and in my opinion should be on any fighting game enthusiast's library.TL;DR: You're buying this game because of its great/complex combat system and because of Type-Moon, not really targeted to casual players (read above for further explanations)."

Even with that, I am still a scrubby nooblet. This game is quite deep, and takes a lot to master, but it is also fairly accessable at a base level, only having 3 buttons and straight forward chains.+ Amazing balance and depth+ Dedicated community that has stuck around and will still continue to stick around+ Fast gameplay that rewards aggression+ While not a HD remake, they have smoothed out the sprites and touched up the backgrounds, several with very nice ambient effects+ Over 90 characters due to the Moon system (31 characters with 3 moon styles = 93 possible playable characters)+ Great characters — albeit, on average less outrageous than most others+ Satsuki Yumizuka- The game does not have a challenge/trial system, which means that you have to look up and figure things out entirely from third party sources, which presents a barrier to entry- As mentioned by others, there are largely speaking only two sorts of players right now: the incredibly new, and the incredibly experienced. The experience gradient will even out over time- As of release, the netplay is experiencing issues, but I am confident that it will be fixed relatively quickly—Arc System Works games generally have stellar netplay- Some people might experience some lag on some of the revamped stages, such as the cherry blossom stage that now has actual cherry blossoms falling (it's pretty neat). I've heard there's an option to turn off sprite smoothing, but I don't know if it also changes the stages—I'm inclined to believe it does, but even if it doesn't, you can just avoid the problem stagesThis is honestly the best-designed fighting game I've ever had the joy to play, and you should certainly give it a shot if you're considering."

It's an amazing fighter mechanically, and I've been a huge fan of the Type-Moon setting for years.But as of right now, about three days after release, this version of the game is bad. Not ""PSP port of Fate/Unlimited Codes"" bad, where it was a stripped down port, so if you just want to play against other people in the same room it's perfectly fine. Identical to the last PC version that was released.But the netcode is awful. When the connection's particularly bad, it can make hit-confirms or any sort of reaction-based play completely impossible. Which unfortunately pretty much means Ranked is a crapshoot.And on top of that, the translation of the Arcade mode is pretty bad. It's littered with typos, names and terms are translated rather inconsistently (Wallachia/Warachia, for example, as well as the regular use of honorifics) and a lot of subtleties aren't conveyed at all for people unfamiliar with the original visual novel (no distinction between Shiki and SHIKI, and characters like Akiha, Hisui, and Miyako all refer to Shiki simply by name most of the time). If you're already a fan of Tsukihime, you'll probably be able to notice when this happens and will probably be able to infer the original intent, but players less familiar with but still interested in the story will be left in the dark.Though I will say it's nice that most of the setting terms were translated in accordance with the terminology most of the English-speaking fanbase uses. In constrast to, say, Fate/Extra, which can be very jarring for existing fans to read when they start using terms like ""Legendary Soul"" instead of ""Heroic Spirit.""In short, this game is in dire need of some patches to fix the netplay and the scripts.

There are three style based on moon phases that change your character in some cases in subtle ways and in others massively and some say this adds a lot of difficulty. Speaking as someone who has not been playing this game for neigh 10 years like some even while following it for a while I can say that difficulty or not there is just something really fun that clicks with me very well about this game. It is one of the few 5 button fighters like Guilty Gear but even preferring GG's style and characters I find Melty Blood to be way more enjoyable and probably the easier of the two to get into. It's nice to see after years of community effort and fan translation we finally have an official port here on Steam for languages other than Japanese.I just really enjoy this game and can't recommend it enough."

Melty Blood is very accessible (the most accessible in the genre imo), and complex at the same time.

Also somethings about the mystic eyes of death,Shiki being an imposter, Vampire queens, and all that other stuff. Don't worry about it.Well, Melty Blood just happens to be a story set after the events of Tsukihime and god is it a great story to invest yourself into. (Also, helps a lot with watching Carnival Phantasm seeing as half the cast in that is from Tsukihime)Now, the game plays pretty good for a port from the PS2. There's a few things that can be desired from the controls, and maybe a bit of character scaling, but on a whole, it's a great port. The graphics have been cleaned up. Everything's looking nice a sharp. The game performs fantastically. On a whole, they did well. Also it's in English (except the voices). Makes it a but load easier to play and get invested in the story.The game is fairly hard to get good at, especially if you haven't played this sort of game genre before. Also fairly hard if you're like me and you played the Japanese version where select and back are reversed haha... But a few characters are worse fights than others. While playing the story mode, I'd dread meeting up with ""Ciel"" as there'd be a very troubling and arduous fight ahead of me because she's both strong in close and long range with very fast attacks, nailing down your HP in seconds. Then there's the problems with the final arcade mode boss for each character... It seems to be more up to chance than it is up to skill and up to you learning the boss's attack pattern before you're able to take them down. Also, you rarely know what's hitting you as the whole screen seems to be the hitbox... (Also, there's being corner guarded... Stay far away from the corners kids =))Apart from that, the rest of the characters are pretty well balanced and fun to play and fight against. As you play the game, your skills will rise but you'll most likely never have an easy time with the computer. While not being hard at all points in time, they don't make it easy for which is good. It incourages you to be on your toes at all points in time.On a whole, this is a pretty good fighting game with some good challenges and not many unfair situations that you can find yourself in.Anyway, if you're looking for a good fighting game and a good story, then look no further! This is the first fighting game that I was willing to buy and steam and boy was it a good choice."

While this may seem miniscule it should be noted that these are also able to be assigned through the cccaster version.The Steam Version offers no new additional content, and even fails to include the Boss Rush mode(As well as Riesfbye Route B) of the previous PS2 version.In short you're better off using the cccaster version which, while having an incomplete translation, certainly tops having to pay Gabe all your Steam Bux.It isn't worth even a quarter of the price it's currently at, I suggest picking up the cccaster version instead and using other methods to interact with the Melty community."

Maybe because the market is filled with uninspired sequels for the shelfes. So this is a real unique selling position in my opinion, which is urgently needed, because Beat 'em up games are facing a decreasing market. Just think of the last Street Fighter V game, which was a big disappointment for Capcom and the players as well. Only the last Tekken Title was a great success due to a clever viral marketing.So what about Melty Blood Actress Again Current Code?First of all you got to know this is a PS2 port that was originally released in 2011. But it´s really a good port of the game. So you can expect a classic ""back to the roots"" fighting game with a challenging and complex fight mechanism. Further more it has a huge amount of playable characters with 3 different fighting styles each. I can highly recommend to read the various guides on the MB (Melty Blood) community page, to get a clue how to master the controlls. To describe it´s difficulty: Well let´s say it´s easy to learn, but hard to master.So it´s not as difficult as the Virtua Fighter Games, where you have to spend many ingame hours to gain a small success. Only if you really intend to mess with the real pros out there, you (and me too) definitely have to spend some playtime in it. But this point leads to the main negative point of the game. Because you can´t compete with other dudes online, in the current game version. I´ve tryed to login a network session one time, and it don´t work for me. But you can read a lot of complaints about this topic on the review site of the game. So if you intend to enjoy a few online fights, you have to wait till this issue get fixed by the developers.But everthing else like the visual novel storytelling, the smooth animations and the complex fighting mechanism makes this title worth a try for everyone who is searching for a classic ""back to the roots"" fighting game.Pros- Type Moon- Shiki Ryôgi- Various characters with 3 different fighting styles- Easy to learn- Challenging and complex fighting system, where you can spend hours to master your favourite characterCons- Network issue really sucks- training mode should have some controll advises, so you could learn more effectiveSo give it a try, you definitly won´t regret it. At least it´s only 22 EUR that you have to spend."

Melty blood chars have various types of jumps and airdashes combinations that lead to changing direction in the air multiple times.The jump angles aren't so variated as kof as you don't have a superjump backwards or hops, but you can control the falling arc of neutral jump/superjump/doublejump and can combine jumps/superjumps/doublejumps with airdashes very freely.The other is how projectyles work.There is no projectyle colisions in the game. The usual for projectyles is to pass throght each other, but if they do destroy each other they have a normal hurtbox that can be destroyed with a normal attack.There is a marker for projectyle types of moves, but it is only used to mark what can be reflected.Btw, Melty have a lot of ""projectyle looking things"" that don't reach fullscreen and can't be reflected.This combination make projectyle wars dynamics becomes something very different, and generally end very fast with someone taking a hit/blocking/deciding to maneuver around it or away form it.As a feature of the ""Actress Again"" subseries, we have as a stample feature a ""groove system"" with 3 styles.Each style have their subset of mechanics (like kof 98 or cvs2), but a different moveset too (like mkx).Crescent Moon is based on the general mechanic of old versions.This means that this groove retains multiple defensive options (""parry"", dodge, ""alpha counter"", ""burst"", etc) and the moveset is commonly based on the older versions with some new tricks added.The crescent groove usually will have the largest moveset (really hard to predict), but not necessarily the strongest individual moves.Due to retaining the meter mechanic from older games, they have the best control of it.Half Moon and Full Moon are original takes on mechanic and moveset, and usually leads to more simple and straight foward characters.Half Moon can be considered the ""speed groove"".Their walkspeed an dashes are the same or faster than Crescent Moon versions.For some characters jumps/airdashes startup/landing/travel speed is slightly better too.They have less control over the meter, but gains acess to a better ""alpha counter"" with it and a sucessfull ""parry"" triggers a auto-counter that launch in the air.All of them have a sequence of 3 attacks triggered by imputing 5a6aa, that is at the same time a basic combo tool and a pressure tool.Full Moon can be considered the ""power groove"".Their walkspeed and dashes are the same or slower than Crescent Moon versions.Sometimes their dashes will be a little faster, but less controllable than other versions.It's very common for their 2A to be a low, jA to be a overhead and to have better frame advantage and hitbox in normals.Different from other moons, they can cancel the landing recovery into block even after using a attack in the air.It's important to notice that Crescent Moon and Half Moon have a more freeform chain route, while Full Moon have a more rigid one.Outside of command normals, Full moon can only follow the ""from weak attack to strong"", standing Mid to crouching Mid and use a single grounded strong (or standing or crouching) in a chain.Crescent Moon and Half Moon can go from crouching to standing regardless of the button, and even go ""from strong to attack to weak"".This usually will give a more flexible pressure for Crescent and Half moon grooves, with more chances to prolong and reset blockstrings.But the better frame advantge and proprieties of Full Moon normals compensate this."
,Recommended,411370,22530657,"Posted: 20 April, 2016",all,I'm a single lady,"As a player being torn between recommending and not recommending this game, I ultimately went with recommending this game. There are ups and downs, and I don't mean this towards the core gameplay. That part specifically is sheerly preference. If you want to know if this game is fun, watch reviews, look at tournament footage, pirate first and buy later. I won't get deep into detail about the core game.Melty is an old game and it has not seen a US release for almost a decade if not already. Melty seeing a steam release is beyond phenomenal, obviously. If you're a hardcore Melty lover, here's your chance to throw your money away in blind support.Now, this is a very early review. A VERY early review. I have my doubts, but there's a chance that new content or possibly even DLC could exist, but seeing as how dead the game is nowadays, this is highly unlikely. French Bread has moved on to other products. It was a miracle to even get a rank match system, which is one of the ups the steam version has. It also has wide screen which doesn't really do much but show you a portion of the characters' movelist.Here's some Pros and Cons. Content wise, it's a little disappointing that the only thing that's NEW to this steam version is having an english translation and a matching system. If you look at the console versions of Melty, you'd see that it has a lot more content, such as the boss rush mode, eclipse moon style, secret bosses, and whatever else that I can't think of. I'm actually unsure why the completely removed team battles from Act Cadenza, not to mention. Not even the console version kept it. Maybe it just wouldn't work the the new system, who knows. But oh well.Now for some additional details. When initially playing the game on ranked, I found a lot of super laggy players who ended up quitting immediately. After messing with the filtering for a bit, I actually got quite a few matches that were really good with the connection filter set to at least 1+. You may want to do 2+, but depending on how slowly you get matches (and the popularity of the game), you may want to put the numbers lower. The netcode ain't perfect, but it's tolerable and I can do decent combos against opponents on the fly. There's also no rollback either. In general, I had a decently fun time fighting new opponents every now and then. At first, my filter was a bit strict and I kept getting only 2 of the same people, but after putting some more leniency on the filters, I got a lot more people, new people everytime, almost. In short, don't choose ""ANYONE"" for your connection filter, I personally had a bad time with it.In closing... if you're a melty fanatic, get this game if you really want to support it. The online and english features gives us english speakers access to the game. It makes the game more accessible and doesn't force us to have to pirate it just to play it without importing or some nonsense. Even without the steam version coming out, there's an entire community out there on a site calledmeltybread.comwho has a few other connections as well, one of them being a Discord channel dedicated to melty banter and matches. Heck, even the fanmade patches and mods have MORE features than the steam version! The CCCaster being a prime example! There are a lot of ways to get consistent matches with people around your skill level WITHOUT the steam version. But obviously, this is NOT about being able to simply being able to play the game. This is exposure and that's what counts. I honestly do not know how far this game will come, now that it's on steam, but to be brutally honest, I'm sort of pessimistic about it. This is part of the reason why I feel Melty should be a little bit cheaper than what it is now, even with the current discount that makes it $19.99. But... hey, I'm still recommending this, aren't I? That just shows you how much I like the game.Click here for part 2"

,Recommended,411370,22527809,"Posted: 19 April, 2016",all,bloodyoverdrive,"Melty Blood is a momentum and pressure-centric fighting game.I'll try to cover what makes melty unique compared to other fightans:-Simple and low res, but very fluid and stylish spritework. This makes it easier to see and recognize startup animations.-Easy motions for special moves; nothing more complex than a half-circle motion. Combined with the relatively large buffer window for specials, melty is an easy game to pick up and mash for anybody familiar with fighting games.-Very loose cancel window after normals. In C and H moon, you can pretty much press any button after any other button. Gattlings are only present in F moon. This creates a technique called 'reverse beat', in which a move with a long recovery can be wiff canceled into a button with faster recovery. These properties mean that pressure if focused around normals; you want to leave a 1~2 frame gap between normals to catch people trying to do something other than blocking.-Throw properties. The character waking up has a few frames of throw invincibility and can OS with 1ad. They are relatively weak and hard to hit given the speed and reach of 2a. Once you earn respect, you can't just spam throw to win the round, instead you must continue pressurring with normals in order to get an opening.-Teching when hitting the ground is done by holding a direction. There is a short hop with invlun followed by a brief vulnerable recovery. During oki there is no vairable timing, which means that the person waking up may get caught in a meaty attack if they choose to tech incorrectly. This heavily favors the attacking player as they can do a combo and follow it up with another one if done correctly. Blocking and teching properly becomes important skills in order to stay alive.-Everybody gets a double jump AND an air dash. Air counterhits pop the enemy in the air and is untechable until they hit the ground. This is an easy, damaging, and important way to convert into a combo+knockdown. Most characters also lack an anti-air move. Given all this air mobility, the importance of air counterhits, and lack of grounded anti-airs means most of the footsies occur in the air.-Crossup protection. Seeing how easy it is to hop on your opponent's head, the game has crossup protection, which allows you to block a crossup by still holding back. No gay ambiguous Ryu j.MK setups.-2abc5c jbc jbc air throw. You now know the basic bnb for almost the entire cast. Less emphasis on combos, more  on spacing, pressure, and oki.-Huge cast of viable characters. If you can get momentum, you can come back and win the round.Melty Blood is easy to pick up and play, and if given a little bit of dedication and effort, can become an enjoyable fighting game experience."

The input delay kept getting worse and worse from there, hitting about 3 seconds of delay at the end.Overall, I'm waiting to see if the netcode lag will be fixed in a few weeks, because if this remains like this, I'll have to return it because the multiplayer is often unplayably bad.I'd definitely recommend it if the multiplayer worked."

Pro-tip: don't release a game until you fix the reason most people are buying it.何年間待ってたのに、ネットプレイが酷すぎて、大ファンとしてがっかりです。Why do I prefer this fighting game over others? I love how it feels as a fighter. The characters have lots of mobility and many options at their disposal. The sprites are low res, but beautifully animated with aesthetically pleasing keyframe poses, movement speeds, gravity, weight, etc. Tons of characters with completely different variations, as well as multiple playing styles for each. A plethora of great music tracks, stages, etc, etc.The problem is, I bought this version for its netplay, which has turned out to be... lacking, to say the least. If I'd known the netplay would be this bad, I would have stuck with the version compatible with fan-made Caster/Rollback support.I waited YEARS for this to get a proper release, and as I feared and expected, this is the sad result. I held out on a refund in the hopes that they'd soon announce Caster/Rollback support, to no avail. Now it's too late to get a refund.So, I guess... if you like fighters for their gameplay, I highly recommend this. If you like fighters for playing with others (I'm pretty sure most fighting game fans fall into this category), then I cannot recommend this. Not because it's a bad game, because it is most definitely not a bad game. It just fails hard where it likely matters most.I'd hoped this version would give this game the attention it deserves, and foster a healthy online community. Unfortunately, the poor netplay support (or lack of) has once again sealed its fate, damning it to a dark, dank corner.Even if they were to fix the netplay now, it's very likely to be far, far too late.

It's good this game got its long overdue official localization.If you're new to this game and wondering if you should buy it, it's a fairly easy game to pick up at any skill level or experience with fighting games in general. It's fairly well balanced and has a bunch of neat mechanics, which keeps it interesting at a higher skill level. Most of the special moves are fairly easy to execute, with the most difficult ones being a half circle on a controller/stick. The gameplay itself is fast paced compared to most others in the genre. There's a wide variety of characters to play with, and each character comes with three styles to experiment with. I'll spare you the details, but it should give you enough variation to keep the game fresh and fun for a long time.The graphics might look a bit dated, but if you keep in mind that the original artwork for this game is older than a decade it's not really a surprise. That said, given the general style of the game it doesn't really get in the way, and it doesn't matter with the gameplay anyway. The music for most stages is very well done, and sometimes a little too catchy.As for multiplayer... By default as it is, it's a good game for playing with a friend coming over, but the netcode for online play is abominable. Previous iterations of this game were often played using the help of an external tool called CCCaster, so I'm sure something similar will come out over time to make the experience more enjoyable. A bit of a shame the netcode didn't get an update, but I really wasn't expecting a major update to this particular age old problem.On the downside, if you do play against someone over the internet, chances are they've been playing this game on and off for roughly 10 years, and have likely at some point tossed a few 100 yen coins into one of the machines still present in some of the arcade halls in Akihabara today.Good times...JUST BUY IT ALREADY!"

However, if you've used the Mirror Moon fan translation patch that was still being worked on, you can tell the dialogue differs much from this release. Also, remember to use CCaster if you want good online gameplay and better matches.The gameplay is awesome, smooth, and fast-paced with combos that can be easy to make and air dash combos are very fun to pull off! There a total of 31 characters if you count the three moon styles for each character. So, you're going to have a great time to discover and play with most of the characters to familarize and creating yout mains. The animation for each of the characters are great and fun to look at.This game series is a underrated gem and when I share the game to people; they either never heard of the game before or any of the Type-Moon universe at all! Even, when they're average gamers, too bad they messed out on this hidden gem!Melty Blood is an niece fighting game that is pretty well known to the fighting game community thanks to being released back in December 2002 on Japan followed by the Re-Act expansion and the later the arcade sequel Act Cadenza both released 2004 and 2005 respectively. Then the Act Cadenza Ver. B was released in 2007 with balance issues fixes and bug fixes plus unique added features such as tag team. The first Melty Blood is the sequel to the famous Tsukihime visual novel from Type-Moon, the story takes place about 1 year after the events from the visual novel from the true Arucied ending of Tsukihime.Type Moon and French Bread did a wonderful job of updating and fixing the game with many updates and the later updates is Actress Again and the first revision came out in 2008 and the final update which is v1.07 with the 1.4.0 patch is Actress Again Current Code which was released only Carnival Phantasm Season 3 Blu-ray limited edition! The set became extremely rare and hard to find in Japan, so many Type-Moons such as us won't be to buy and play the game officially instead we'd have to pirate the game with the fan translation patch.Due to how awesome this fighting game is compare to other ones is how there are 3 fighting styles to each characters plus the nature of accessible to newcomers and veterans alike! The combo and air combo chains make Melty Blood an awesome game! The elegant memorable iconic characters, story, setting, vampires, and the wonderful music will make you keep coming back to play again and again! Melty Blood is still being talked about today after the final revision update came out back in December 31, 2011 on Windows PC.My most favortie characters is the following: Vampire Sion/Sion TATARI, Arcueid Brunestud, Kouma Kishima, Ryougi Shiki, and Riesbyfe Stridberg. They're one of my mains, so I enjoy using them a lot I love Sion and Vampire Sion the most, I love her personality and character! She is not a vampire fan and pretty angsty about her condition if you know about her backstory. It is why I love her and enjoy her stotic determined intelligent nature and at the same time controlling her vampiric impulses.Melty Blood Actress Again takes place after a year from the true ending of Melty Blood folliowing the events of the expansion pack Melty Blood Re-ACT and  Melty Blood Act Cadenza. A event known as 'Hologram Summer' appears repeating the events from the first Melty Blood.I am grateful to the Mirror Moon staff of working hard on the english translation patch and the able to understand and play the Melty Blood series on PC which was a Japanese only release.I love Melty Blood and I am a huge fan of the game series, I collect almost all of the scale figures and the prize figures plus the physical copy of the games and the Carnival Phantasm Blu-ray Complete limited edition set! I am also a huge Type-Moon fanatic so I am obessed with the Nasuverse and the Fate series too! But I enjoy and love Tsukihime more and I can't wait for the Tsukihime remake visual novel to come out in Japan sooner and later with a english translation patch later on!This is the first Melty Blood game ever officially released on Steam.Whether you're new or old to this series, I recommend to buy this game now and hopefully it will convince Arc Drive Systems and French Bread to release the earlier Melty Blood games on Steam!I still suck at this game and not too good when playing aganist opponents, because I get destroyed easily. I should have discovered Melty Blood and the Nasuverse a long time ago but I was a fool then...Melty Blood is what started for me to discover Tsukihime and the Fate series!So buy and enjoy playing this awesome cult-classic fighting game which is not too well known to the mainstream masses due to being a Japan-only release at that time and it's a Vampire fighting game which is pretty rare!"

Upon researching further, I found many people saying that it was one of the smoothest, funnest, hardest, and rewarding fighters they had ever played. Wanting context, I went and played Tsukihime, the visual novel ( from 2000 ( Its pretty ancient )), and left with not only a newly found addiction to VN's, but a love for my new favorite company aside from nintendo (type moon) and one of the most enjoyable fighting games I have ever played. If you find fighting games more fun to play than to watch, then Melty Blood is what you've been looking for. If you love beautiful, fluent sprite work, then Melty is godsend. If you want a fictional world filled with alot of consepts and philosophy, then Tsukihime is for you, and you'll find soul in your character. I think this is arc systems hidden gem revealed to the world, and I cannot exaggerate how great a game this is.Pros:+ Its incredibly fast paced+ The mindgame potential in some matchups are incredibly high+ A huge focus to movement options+ High pressure situations+ Well balanced gameplay+ Great shoutout to fans of Tsukihime / Kagetsu ToyaCons:- Fairly hard to learn- Netplay has always had problems- Many players have played for decades, so its pretty hard to get into, and the meta has pretty much already been set by the Japanese community 8 years ago...- Based off of a now obscure eroge"

The story is REALLY obscure as far as structure and narrative goes, and there's so many references to religion, and obscure myth, that it can often be overwhelming. This is what I actually DISLIKE about Type Moon stories. Mythology ends up being too important for the story to make sense. But, as this is a fighting game, I am not here for the story. So, how is the fighting? Pretty good, I would say, and there's no real major gripes from me. However, I need to stress this, DO YOUR RESEARCH on this game. Otherwise, you're going to be lost. There is NO TUTORIAL or challenges in this game, so figuring out how a character works is really down to you. Here are some of my finer points and gripes below.+AMAZING soundtrack. I feel like this needs no mention, but I should anyway. If a piece of music in a game can keep my toes tapping, and keep me listening for a half-hour plus, then you KNOW it's good. The names of the tracks are a little weird, though...+ Fun and simple, albeit deep combat system. When I said there's no tutorial, and made it sound like a gripe, I meant it as a complaint. There's no tutorial, which means, while yes, the game is simple to get a hold of, you will need to mess around quite a bit to get the hang of things. That being said, not to spoil it, I do quite enjoy the setup this game has. A few mechanics escape me at the moment, but it's nothing overly confusing.+ The sprites are just bursting with life. The sprites may look like something out of 1997, but for what is worth mentioning, it's the animations and how much life is in them that make the sprites amazing. Also, let me just say that the backgrounds, while some are rather plain, are rather well-done. I also love the VFX of this game, so overall, great visual design.- NO ENGLISH DUB- STORY IS TOO OBSCURE TO GET A HOLD OF- NO TUTORIAL!!!- Not enough content for the price- Online community is deadOverall, I give this an 8/10.Also, I would ♥♥♥♥ THE EVER LOVING HELL out of Riesbyfe, gender be damned."

General Anime fanI've played tons of fighting games but I'm in no way super competitive so I can't explain to you what this game has as far as mechanics over other titles. what I can tell you is that it's characters is highly diverse with even the silliest ones fitting well into the world. There is no story mode however the Arcade mode of the game will provide at least enough dialogue to get you invested in the fighter, their goals (or lack thereof), and a hint of the lore.To add to that each character has three different styles. Crescent, Half, and Full moons. If you're a combo heavy player you'll enjoy Crescent Moon style. Full moon style gives you hard hits and decent damage at the sacrifice of usually being slight slower. Finally Half-Moon style cuts out a lot of the more complicate mechanics and usually gives your character a more vast move set that is a mix of the other two. This essentially gives the already sizable cast nearly triple the size as they can play like a totally different fighter depending on the style you pickThe music of the game is fairly well done with a mix of mellow and harder hitting tracks. Plenty of stages, and while this game is a bit old the sprite work is still hasn't aged a day.The netplay has been solid for me so far. Haven't had trouble playing in over 4 man lobbies.

,Recommended,411370,22738006,"Posted: 1 May, 2016",all,「JOKER」,"TL;DR  The game itself is good but the multiplayer right now doesn't work so well.My recommendation for this game stems largely from my experiences with it prior to the Steam release.  That said, there is 1 big issue that should be taken into consideration before dropping any money on this port.First, the Good stuff.The fighting mechanics feel very nice, but because every fighter is largely quarter-circle, z-motion, and down-down specials, they may feel really close to each other in terms of controls.  I personally came to like this, as it made every fighter feel accessible, while at the same time still forcing you to actually learn how they play, but some others may not feel this way, so keep that in mind.  Also, the soundtrack is pretty rad too.  There is also an abundance of character playstyles, as there are 31 total characters, but each character has 3 different Moon-Styles, which are somewhat similar to Mortal Kombat X's variant types.  And these 3 different styles, while having similar moves, all perform considerably different from each other, so it doesn't feel entirely like you're playing the exact same character.  As far as Singleplayer content goes, this game packs about as much stuff as you would expect from any fighting game: there's the standard Arcade Mode, a Versus Mode, and a Training Mode.  Arcade Mode is where you'll get the 'story' for the game, if you're into that stuff, and from what I've seen the story is pretty enjoyable, especially for Type-Moon fans who are already familiar with the series.  If you play solo, or locally with a friend, then this game will serve you just fine.Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the online multiplayer.As of right now, the netplay for this port is just awful.  I spent a good 15 minutes just trying to connect to somebody online, and the one time I managed to actually start a match, I was experiencing a good whole second or two of input lag, which basically made the match unplayable.  From what I hear, I'm not the only one this happened to either.  Hopefully ArcSys fixes this, as it seems like they're well aware of the issue, which is the primary reason I still recommend this game.Overall, I give this game a solid 7/10.  As good as this game is, the poor netplay seriously holds this game back.  That said, if you're willing to wait a bit for the netplay to get fixed, or if you'll mostly be playing offline, then this is a title I definitely recommend."

When that place shut down I was devastated.  Thanks to whoever brought this awesome game to Steam.  Now for a (admittedly biased) review...This has long been my favorite fighting game of all time though not exactly because it is the best fighting game in the world.  I do not have the reflexes or the technical skills to dominate at Street Fighter or King of Fighters because those games require very sharp very specific abilities.  Melty Blood has never seemed that way to me.  I won't go so far as to say ""a fighting game for button mashers"" but at times imbalances in the game allow you to get away with that.  To be fair my experiences were with the original.  Further I will say that I have been absolutely demolished enough time by a skilled Chaos player or a Shiki player who simply didn't let me touch them to know that, if you have those skills and reflexes I lack, there is enough technical possibilities here to delight any fighting game fan.Summary:  A fighting game for the masses (in my opinion) that still has enough technical ability to let players who want to play competitively do so while still letting those of us who just love to kick our friends butts with anime characters (and have our butts kicked by them) have fun.I can't recommend this game enough.

While a few of the sprites might have aged a little bit, the visuals in this game are outstanding, and it has one of- if not the very best soundtrack in a fighting game, with many iconic tunes with a ton of variety. Definately purchase this.Now, there are some negatives. These are mostly just small nitpicks, so bare with me. Now, from what I've heard of the netcode, it could definately be better, as I've heard of multiple cases of lag and disconnections. However, it seems these netcode problems are being patched as I'm writing this, so we'll see how it will turn out in the future. The second problem I have is a very minor one, but a problem nonetheless. When in training mode, there is a option to be able to reset the position of the characters at where you started. Most fighting games have this, but in this port things are a little different. In most other fighting games, the standard button for resetting positions are usually the select button, when playing on a stick or DS3 that is. However, when you set the button for training mode reset, the select button is the button for removing buttons, which forces you to use a different button. Also, when you do reset the positions, you reset the music as well, while it usually just continue from where it was in other games. These are VERY minor things, but I would really appreciate it if these problems could be fixed."

Chain combos which usually begin with mashing A or 2A, then going through the other buttons in a sequence that doesn't use the same attack twice (you can mix things up a lot with command normals here), juggle an enemy after a sweep and convert that into an air combo with two normals, a jump cancel, another two normals and a special move or a throw if you want a hard knockdown.As with all fighting games, just find a character you like, spend enough time in training/arcade mode before you go online and you'll be fine.  You'll still lose here and there, but there are things you can only learn from fighting human opponents.  My only complaint is that they fixed the bunker cancel glitch from MBAC that allowed for bara cancels, but I guess that's okay, they were pretty broken (especially where I was concerned, 'cuz I'd more or less mastered them).  Although I do wish the game would have come to Steam so much sooner, I'm happy it got here at all.There is no tutorial, but there is a command list, which lists (almost?) every move in the game.  They even put Kohaku's Drug On Install (I'm still going to call it that, no matter what the game or translation patch decides to call it) in the command list, so it's not a secret move anymore, which I kinda have mixed feelings about.  I like it when a fighting game has secrets 'cuz I grew up when we didn't have command lists and had to figure things out through button mashing or trial and error, but that's just me being an old fart fighting gamer (I think we prefer the term legacy fighting gamer).Either way, while the game doesn't really look that interesting graphically ('cuz it's a PS2 era fighting game [think Capcom VS SNK 2 without teams and true love making]), you'd be surprised with how deep and engaging it really is, and it's still well worth playing to this very day.  In fact, similarly to the groove system from CVS2, the moon phase fighting styles change the mechanics of the game in ways that are both subtle and not so subtle.  I only recently discovered that full moon even lets you use heat activations as roman cancels to extend your combos.  I just use crescent moon most of the time, since it's the mechanics and fighting styles from previous games that I'm used to, but now I wanna try using full moon more.Anyhow, I think I've gushed enough.  TL;DR: Get this game.  Game's fun, and it's been pirated long enough.  Time to shell out some money to the devs and publisher for finally bringing it to the west.  Took their asses long enough."

I was so pleased to see that it has finally been released on Steam and I purchased it right away.The game is amazing! If the anime appearance isn't your thing then try to look past it because there is tons of technical potential and the characters are all unique. Now lets put that unique character potential up by 3. Each character has 3 variations or styles that play significantly different which counts for endless hours of training mode. The pace is fast and intense with mixups and damage being extremely high depending on who you play. The music is great; some being funky club kind and others being operatic and epic for the battles.I've heard the online isn't always great but I haven't used it yet and there's always room for updates and tweaks.

It is an impressive game with very fluid character movement and an intuitive combo system, allowing for both new players to quickly dish out pressure and combos after just starting while rewarding long time players for truly optimizing their characters. Surprisingly, the older, PS2 version of the game had made enough of a name for itself in the US to be voted into EVO 2010 over many other popular fighters at the time. To this day, many fighting game players know of it and have tried it.The translation work done on the game is excellent, as it now allows for some players to appreciate aspects of characters they were unable to read before. Seeing as this is also one the official release of the latest Melty Blood, I am also sure a lot of Japanese players who did not already own it are thankful for a digital copy.Unfortunately, the game suffers some drawbacks on release. For one, there have been players who have been playing this game, in particular this version, for several years, so some player matches and ranked will turn out to be a daunting experience. However, it is a very easy game to learn, and there have been so many tutorial videos on each of the characters (93 characters if we include moon forms), the game could be played with purely fighting game fundamentals.The netplay is fairly attrocious; delay is compounded during matches, so the longer a match draws out, the more input delay both parties will have to suffer. The bundled MBAACC that could be purchased years ago contained a solid netplay matching system and recognizable delay. Considering the other types of netplay ArcSys and FrenchBread have developed for their most recent games, this is really a sour experience.Overall, I do recommend this game for the fun factor. However, I feel that some aspects still need some work to finalize into a great fighter."

You get to be an adorable little cat thing and biimu your enemies to death. Heck, you even get your choice of adorable little cat things that biimu enemies to death: vanilla and nrvnqsr chaos.

You'll probably get double perfected for days until you're able to land a hit on the the top online players and a decade until you'll do it to them.Literally 10 years too early.The soundtrack is great too.  I wish I could get it off Steam but I'll have to settle for other places."
