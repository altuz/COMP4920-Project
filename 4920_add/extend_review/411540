Multiplayer means you can do the same maps with a few other people who will trigger events leading to a missiona failure while you're not there.No open world, no complex customization, no sense of character ownership, totally simple and bland game."

Nothing to do and the Meeting with others in WoW Legion 2 hours away. So i took a look on the new entrys of steam and find this game. Hmm ... shooter ....hmmm ... tanks ... hmmm MECHS!!!!!!! Having a look at the graphics, pictures from the past rises into my Mind. Far far away, there was a game noboddy knows today anymore, or did you ever heard of FUTURE COP LAPD? No? Thats okay.All right, the vids looks nice, just like FUTURE COP and yes of course MECH COMMANDER. Well, i like mechs very much. From the beginning of my childhood. The 80´s. Girls were playing with barbies, boys with cars and me? Me was playing with Mechs (on my AMIGA 500).  Looking at the price ... oh ... okay. Music sounds good, 2 Euros more ... got the Special Edition. Starting installing and 30 Minutes later starting the game.So, lets have a look. This game is an old school top down shooter. In this Game, Story set into the future, you were at first playing a Lone Wolf in a battle armor, who was hired by a corporation. You can jump, run and shoot. You also got Primary and secondary weapons. Following the story you complete one target after another until the end of the level. After 2 Targets i got my mech. This One is slower but heavenly armed. You can enter and leave the Mech each time you want.Following the game Episode after Episode more and more Units can be set free. At least you can have the control on a light Mech, a heavy Mech, a light Tank, a heavy Tank, a battle Helicopter and a Stealth Helicopter.The interesting point is, that each Unit gains experience only, when you use it. They can raise Levels and you get points to raise your Units. The Maps you are playing are big and everywhere are units ready to enter. So, the game let YOU the choice wich One you play to complete the levels. From my experience you can survive with each one, also the battle armor. By the way, if they shoot one of your Uhits down, you are not dead, you will be pushed out of the wreck in your Battle Armor. The Battle armor has an interesting feature, with the secondary weapon you can turn smaler enemys into friends or stun the bigger units for a while. Also you can call another Heavy Mech if you fill an energy bar.Hybrid Wars is really great shooting fun. The gameplay with the Controller is really good. With one stick you controll your moving and with the other the shooting. This game is a shooter not a tatical RTS Game, but it has slightly tactical elements. From upgrading you units (No play -> No experience -> No upgrade), to the choice of using each of them.Also i like the music, that fits perfectly into the game. And the music is really great.IMPORTANT: If you buy the normal Hybrid Wars you get one character, with the Special edition you get the second character and another one if you create a Wargaming account for Multiplayer. More charaters are DLC`s.The only negative point is, i can`t find other players in Multiplayer. Seems dead. Wargaming should get the Servers of Europe, Asia and America together.So, if you like fire and forget games with good music and nice graphics, if you liked MECHWARRIOR 3050 (Mega Drive) or FUTURE COP LAPD, if you like just having fun, this game is for you.Oh yes, my WoW Legion Meeting i mentioned at the beginning, i forgot it. Because of this game. Sorry Mr. Illidan ...."

Your machine gun is a peashooter and your grenades and missiles are like a bag of crap hitting a window (it doesnt splat btw). The enemy death animations are also very disappointing, its some small effect and then they disappear. This feels like it was just another job for the devs, no passion what so ever in the game. The game does not satisfy me in anyway. I've had farts that felt more exciting than this game. Its 'meh' at best. If its on sale (like it is now 75%) you can give it a try but its still 5 euro wasted."

,Recommended,411540,28105060,"Posted: 30 November, 2016",all,linuxpunk,"This is a nice topdown shooter, but not the best out there.ProsEasy to learn.Straight forward gameplay. There's no much flanking or stealth, but you can use buildings or devris as cover, which gives a little tactical depth to the gameplay.Cool graphics.Big and detailed maps, where you can roam freely.You play either in a cyber-armor or in a vehicle (walker, tank, helicopter)Neat models.The mecha design is great.Walkers and tanks look like taken from Ghost in the Shell (from the flashbacks to Motoko's military years in SAC 2gig).Every vehicle feels different to drive. Walker can jump and climb buildings. The heli has inertia and can fly over water and other impassable obstacles. The tank has a different set of controls, which adds to gameplay.Two playable characters (if you sign up toWargame.net, which you need to do anyway if you want to use multiplayer).CONSThree playable characters locked behind a paywall.Kind of shallow tech tree. You can reset your tech points, so no 'hard decisions' when choosing upgrades.Voice acting sucks, I even changed the language to russian (I don't speak russian) to see if it was any better. It wasn't.Uninteresting music.Shallow story. Not very engagin imo. (Voice acting might 'help' in making the story suck)Not much activity online in the North America server, so you might want to buy it for a friend if you want to try the multiplayer.This game has a bunch of good stuff going, but nothing too impressive. (You might wanna checkRunning with riflesif you're looking for a multiplayer top down shooter with a player base).As allways, I appreciate the Linux support"

A very fun twin stick that has enough variance to keep it entertaining. I plan to play to completion and see if it gets boring however, so far, very fun.Some down sides though. Graphics options are lacking, music is repetitive."
,Not Recommended,411540,25791942,"Posted: 30 September, 2016",all,Robotica,"I could only stomach playing through the first level, after that I jut couldn't take anymore. While the artwork is nice and the theme of the game is great it's the actual gameplay mechanics that are the problem. The controls are clunky and buggy to say the least, everything from walking and jumping to shooing and aiming, it's all buggy. Sound effects are dull and boring, combat with enemies sounds like someone dropping books on a table, music is forgettable and not very interesting. For some reason when you shoot you don't even shoot out of your gun, the bullets fly from the side of your gun so combat looks out of sync unless you line your character up. Oh and it seems that the regular purchase only has 2 of the 3 currently available character, for the third one you have to pay more. Oh and the game had a terrible stutter for me, even on the low graphic option (which unfortunately is the only graphics option in the entire game, low or high setting, pathetic)Anyways, I love twin stick shooters, and just to give someone an idea of what this game is like imagine the Halo Spartan Series only much, much worse. From the screen shots and videos it actually comes off a lot better than it is. Watching the game looks awesome, playing the game feels like a fisher price toy."

One thing I have noticed is there seems to be some random frame drops.Other reviews have said things like you are forced to make a wargaming account. Honestly third party accounts isn't all that new but can be annoying to some.Others have also mentioned a locked resolution so if you have a 4k monitor for example it wont work.(I don't so wasn't an issue to me)All in all I'd say grab a buddy and for the price its a solid game have some fun. I recommend it.
76561198173606567,Not Recommended,411540,34096404,Posted: 7 August,all,KeinSchiesse,"I love most times Mechs appear in videogames and it takes a special kind of game to make them seem boring, frail, or lifeless, as this game does. The view on this game is so pulled back as well that it makes even admiring their designs or machinery difficult from a mech enthusiast's standpoint either. The game itself isn't heinously bad by any means -it's functional- but a lot of the effects, enemy, and player designs just look bland. Enemies may have screen-filling mortars that populate the screen that you have to dodge, but then they arrive with all the gusto of a wet fart. The player's own attacks (including an orbital laser) have very little punch to them and are depicted via simplistic effects as well, such as the laser gun ray hitting enemies quietly before they are vaporized when you hit them enough.I bought the DLC for this game as well as the base content hoping it would expand the game beyond it's seemingly thin initial content, but even with some extra characters I find myself not bothering to go through this game anytime soon. It might be more fun co-op with a friend who is also into militaristic / mech style games, but I only was able to play solo and it gets pretty boring with the overall polish of the game leaving a lot to be desired. None of the attacks or effects have much wow factor to them and it all just feels quite generic, making it hard to recommend even to fans of mechs and robots. I would only recommend this at a significant discount, and even then go into it with low, tempered expectations."

,Recommended,411540,25831778,"Posted: 2 October, 2016",all,YGSFox,"This is only a short review after finishing the campaign once with Ivan.The game is exactly what was promised. A classic top-down shooter. End of debate. It's not tactical, it isn't really diverse with it's mechanics. It focuses on shooting things. And it does well at that.You select one of (so far) three characters and jump into the action. The story is....well, it's there. Not more, not less. It isn't that good but again, this isn't what this game is about.You watch everything in a top-down view (surprise). You have a primary weapon, a secondary weapon and an ultimate ability. While on foot, you summon a mecha, walker or whatever you wanna call it. On your missions you can find several vehicles you can use, and you will probably use them most of the time.There you have: a small mecha, a big mecha, a small tank, a big tank, a helicopter and an airplane...thing (which is awesome because of stealth!).In the missions you get several objectives which you have to do in order to advance. Alternatively you can go ahead, screw the objective (for some time) and just blow stuff up.The game is relatively fast paced and easy to learn. It's not too easy, even on the easiest difficulty and you will need about 5 hours to finish one character-playthrough.Graphics are okay. Nothing special and not well optimized yet (rare framedrop-spikes, even on decent machines), but it works and suits the game. (Note that highest resolution is full-hd, 1920x1080, no ultra-wide-screen support yet.)Sound is mediocre. I'm missing some beef, especially with the weapon sounds, but it's not too bad. The soundtrack is really good, the voice acting not that much.Controls are fine. Controller (Dual-Shock 4 with input mapper) as well as Mouse/Keybord work really well, even on standard-mapping. Until now, you can't map controls by yourself, so you have to use (the well working) default.In short: The game is fun, yet nothing groundbraking. It offers you exactly what's promised, it can get challenging, you have unlockables and tons over tons of stuff to blow up. I haven't tried the coop yet but it's promising. If the developers do some fine-tuning, this could become even better.(PS: Some people complain about getting shot from the edges of the screen and the ""unbeatable difficulty even on easy"". As for the edges, you are no sniper, so go ahead and approach in a non-linear way and get close. As for the others...the game isn't that hard. Perhaps you should learn to play instead of ranting on forums. People want to beat everything without effort these days...)"

For a single player or coop campaign, well, that's quite lifespan limiting since once you've seen it you've seen it.

Very satisfying..The graphics are ok for an isometric game and it runs smoothly overall. However i did quickly come across crashing when using recording software, within 30 minutes the game crashed 4-5 times which was annoying, however my game was saved.Controls are also a bit janky which is a shame.
