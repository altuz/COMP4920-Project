For only 40 cents I picked up an awesome Pixel Puzzler. The game is pretty short; only about 1.5-2 hours. There are 3 levels which take around 30-40 minutes each; be aware you can't save in between levels so set aside enough time to complete an entire level.As you explore the wreck you run into various puzzles that involve; moving objects, finding hidden routes and avoiding the monsters that lurk in the deep. You will uncover pages from the past and piece together what happened to bring this steamboat down.Finally, when you come up to light sources you are able to turn off your headlamp and flash back to before the wreck.

,Recommended,411560,19537804,"Posted: 6 December, 2015",all,Audish,"Short games are great if they have a hook that works, and Reveal The Deep does just that. You play an old-tymey metal-helmed submariner, exploring a sunken ship all by your lonesome. I don't need to tell you that something sinister happened there, because the sights and sounds will clue you in to that in short order. While the design isn't quite as immersive as something like CAPSULE, there are plenty of ominous creaks and flickering shadows to keep your pulse elevated. You'll also find journals and letters from the crew that reveal the circumstances of the ship's demise, and it's some quality horror to delve into.The one gimmick the game has is that you can switch your headlamp off (complete with an adorable knock on your giant helm), which can allow other light sources to reveal different aspects of the ship. This is used to great effect in exploration, and also in a few platformy crate puzzles for a little variety. There's a good bit of navigating samey halls, crate pushing, and lever throwing, but as short as the game is, they won't really wear you out before the end. My one gripe is with some of the encounters, which I thought were lazily designed and not very scary at all. They're a stark contrast to the few others which provided some serious jumps, so just be prepared for an uneven level of terror.There are three chapters which should take you 20-30 minutes to clear, depending on how much exploring you do. It's absolutely worth your time if you like spooky subnautical adventures, with only a few minor wrinkles in an otherwise clean package."

The atmosphere is great as you move through rooms with only your light providing some illumination: not knowing what might be lurking a few feet from you can get genuinely unsettling when you consider the great sound design.The actual gameplay is pretty simple and boils down to exploring, jumping through a few platforms, pushing blocks and/or use levers to solve puzzles and escape the occasional danger. If you die you'll start at a checkpoint and there's quite a few of them so that things don't get frustrating. Do take note though that you'll have to clear a chapter if you want your progress saved, if you quit to desktop you'll start from the beginning of your last level: thankfully each one takes only about 30 minutes to clear though.Reveal The Deep comes fully recommended due to its great atmosphere and fairly intriguing story, its extremely cheap price makes it a true bargain."

Mann,"Reveal the Deep, developed by Lazy Monday Games, is not one of a kind, but wanders outside the box just enough to warrant a playthrough. It’s got the atmosphere, mystery and puzzles to keep you hooked, but it isn’t void of flaws.The story is interesting in its own respects. You play as a diver, exploring the carcass of a sunken ship at the bottom of the sea. Notes are scattered about each of the 3 levels, explaining how the ship got all the way down there. Basically, explorers discovered an island which once held an entire civilization. Now, only abandoned temples and villages remain. Of course, the explorers take an array of mysterious artifacts home. But, low and behold, the artifacts are cursed, and everyone on board is in for a bad day.Gameplay is fairly straight forward. You’ll encounter some obstacles and puzzles throughout the game, but nothing too challenging. Reveal the Deep relies on its puzzles the most. Thankfully, the devs have implemented a really cool trick to keep gameplay fresh. At certain times, you’ll be able to jump between alternate realities. Swapping realities changes the map’s layout. Platforms may disappear, certain objects react differently in each reality, and hidden items, such as notes, can only be accessed by utilizing this mechanic. This ability is one of the game’s saving graces and it keeps things interesting.The graphics are what they are: very simple pixel art accompanied by a small collection of animations. At first, it really is nice on the eyes. Tiny bubbles plume from your helmet, and the light blue tinge of your flashlight illuminates the corridors ahead, but not enough to uncover what horrors dwell beyond. But after an hour or so of gameplay, the charm starts to fade. After Reveal the Deep’s first chapter, you’ve seen almost everything in the graphics department.Thankfully, sound design is top notch. Each step vibrates throughout the ship’s iron tomb like the beat of a gong, and deep sea ambiance drives home the feeling that you’re all alone. It managed to keep me on edge from start to finish and is done exceptionally well.Reveal the Deep isn’t a “must buy” experience, and it’ll only take you a little over an hour to complete. But it’s got the atmosphere, intriguing story and thoughtful puzzle solving to warrant a buy. It’s only 99 cents, so there isn’t much of a gamble to be had. Who knows, it just might be worth your time."

76561198141404871,Recommended,411560,24145867,"Posted: 6 July, 2016",all,joan4003,"Greenlight, Indie, Horror walking simulator - Immediate question was it worth playing? Answer - YES.  DEFINITELY YES. Was it worth the $1 US? It is definitely worth more than that actually.Storyline: In 1901 the passenger/cargo ship Eurydice sunk with everyone on board and no survivors.  What happened on board and why is that diver even there in the first place is the big mystery. (Unlimited oxygen supply since the player is in a dive suit walking around this dilapitated wreck going deeper and deeper into its bowels searching for answers.) Besides just who is that diver? (No spoiler, I will let the player figure it out.)While playing my son asked curiously, ""What are you playing?""""Reveal the Deep"" I reply, without thought.""You DO realize that is a horror game?"" he remarks incredulously.  He knows I hate horror games.""It is?"" I replied totally shocked.Yes, actually this is a horror game, psychological terror would be more precise.  The reviews comment on how scary this game is.  It is scary, very scary in fact, with a couple of very good and well placed jump scares.  However, unlike most people I did not play with headphones on, in the dark, and in the middle of the night.  With headphones on at night in the dark, the combination of the creaks and groans of the ship, the occassional almost heard talking of many people, the thuds and thumps of unseen unknowns, the general decay and terrifying atmosphere of knowing one is not alone certainly has that terror factor well and truly targeted precisely.This terror factor really goes into effect as one explores since the player had limited visibility due to only being able to see what the flashlight on the dive helmet reveals in a vertical maze of corridors.  Also if the player taps on their helmet one of two things happen 1) most of the screen goes dark except for the helmet (truly all alone in the dark ... maybe) or 2) alternate time occurs (shown in an eerie red light).  (I could debate future time as well as past but that is for the player to determine.)According to the developers each chapter (3 total) should take approximately 20-30 minutes to complete.  If one looks at my time it was far longer then that. (Minus the idle time to make dinner, do errands, repeating a chapter or two, I would say my actual play time was around 3 - 4 hours.) I would say unless someone is every good at completing mazes in the dark, while solving some quite intricate puzzles and later fending off things that will kill you, I doubt this 20-30 time frame is accurate for a first time playthrough.  I estimate about an hour for each chapter, assuming one does not get stuck and have to start the chapter again.About that - starting a chapter from the beginning.  There is no save feature mid-chapter.  So if the player leaves the game the player must begin at the beginning of the chapter they were on.  The player is warned about this, so no crying.  However, if one dies, there is a feature where the player begins at their last hidden ""save"" point - basically a safe place before death occurs.  That is very useful when one accidently dies (especially late) in a chapter or when trying to survive while figuring out where to go or what to do.The game is relatively linear, though the player does not necessarily have to find everything there is to find, and the path is generally coaxing the player along from one puzzle element to the next (and through the storyline).  It is an exploration game after all.  The player can find snarky comments, interactive places, along with Isaac's letters, Beatrice's diary pages and Tom's journal entries all of which tell the tragic tale of the horrible fate that befell the ship and all those on board. (Look for those (!) exclamation points.)  The ending made perfect sense to me, but then again I actually read everything I could find.One last item to touch on - glitches, glutches, and oubliettes - This game worked fine for me.  No problems.  Even all the achievements popped for me.  So I can only assume of as July 6, 2016 the developers have fixed all those little nagging problems that have plagued many players causing them to express their displeasure.In the end I recommend this game, and for those who like horror do play at night, in the dark, with your headphones on.  I am sure you will appreciate the skin crawling effect the sound track has and as for those jump scares - careful not to tip your chair over."

Exploration feels oddly risky, as you're unable to see the full scope of a room before you enter. Little things seem to dart in the corners of your eyes which builds the suspense even more. The first time you see a creature, it's illuminated by the shafts of light from your torch that pierce through the gaps between stairs, and you'll feel that frisson of nervous excitement. The second time you see a creature, you might feel a little bolder, might want to get up close to see what will happen.Go on, see what'll happen.Highly recommend this game, especially considering how cheap it is. My only concern would be the lack of saving mid chapter, as it locks you into finishing chapters in one fell swoop. This will probably help prevent people running off when they get spooked then coming back and reducing the charm of the horror though so I can't complain too much."

But to my surprise, this game was one of the best i've played in a while. Just a small project done with someone who knew what they were doing, and made that specific thing flawless.I absolutely love the artstyle of this game, there's something about the more detailed pixelart style like SNES era that really draws me in, and luckily games like that seem to come more and more often.While not being -that- long it is surprisingly long for being a good looking game and really cheap, often with a combo like this it's either a long game with horrible quality or a high quality game which is just really really short. Sure, the first chapter took me 0.6 hours, which isn't alot of time compared to what you might be able to put in a tripple A title, but with there being 3 chapters (from what i've heard) then the game will give you at least a good hour of playtime.What i really love about this game is just being surounded by darkness, with only the small light coming from your diving helmet to light up your path as you explore a strange sunken wreck and with only the sound of the ocean floor and creeking parts of the wreck to be heard, no eerie music, just the noises you'd expect from actually being in a place like this.The game is short, but i bet you that if exploration and atmospheric games interest you, then that dollar couldn't be spent better anywhere else."

The puzzles are ridiculously simple and you find yourself having to backtrack way too much, I mostly found myself walking around aimlessly, I feel as though if there was more objective it would have made a better game.

I have spent about 30 minutes to get past the first chapter; 5 of those were afk and about another 5 getting to the conclusion of how to pass a monster.This game, for me, has come out of the blue. The 'trailer' and pictures gave me a sense that this would be a good game. It broke those expectations of just being a good game. First through the game they have a good tuturoial bit that pushes you straight into exploring the ship. You soon learn how the dev(S) have utilized a certain control to change your entire enviornment at times. It's breath takinging if you ask me. This begins to allow you to be emersed in the story, or more so the history of the ship. Charcters begin to pop up in this history and whoever drew them, great job!! The characters had a sense of looking of their era while also giving off personaility traits. Somthing like that in an indie game is superb. Among the scenery you also have lighting that ties into the control I spoke of before. Again emersing you into the history. Most of the time though you are just left with the creepy sounds of a ship, along with sounds of being watched?? It's all simple yet so complex in it's own way for story telling. If that makes sense. Some reviewer said ""you get an empty vibe"". And that is exactly how I would explain it.Anywho some more downsides of this. Since it doesn't have a save feature sometimes it can be a bit weird. Some animations and pixels are just a bit eh but most are really fluent and fun to watch. Srsly though, go get the game. It is more worth 2$+ if you ask me but I guess having it this low right away will help get the game publicity and the developer.Second monster ♥♥♥♥ed me up with my heart pouding for a good minute, simple yet complex, no save only between chapters, super awesome, puzzles can make you think, go get this. 9/10 maybe for the type of game it is. 8.2/10 for overall ness if that makes sense. :D"

The mechanics are as simple as they should be, with the smart use of few abilities to overcome various puzzles and obstacles. Also notable is the 2D, pixel-based scrolling, that works perfectly well with the setting and the narrative - a 3D rendition would simply not workin this case.

You take the role of a diver as you explore the sunken ruins of a sprawling ship in order to find out what led to its demise. The story is progressively revealed through the discovery of diary entries left behind by various of the ship's past passengers and, to my surprise, it was actually very interesting and disturbing. Its 2D pixel graphics work wonders in reinforcing a constant sense of threat and solitude as does its lack of music, solely focusing on natural sounds of the deep. Its platforming sections are mostly basic, focusing on jumping and pushing crates, but it does have a very interesting ""light"" mechanic that I had never seen before and found quite refreshing. In a few words, by pressing the ""space"" tab on your keyboard, you toggle your light on and off which, in some spaces, reveals much more that you might originally had thought was there.There is really not much else to say about it. It took me about 2 hours to beat with every achievement, but for the price of 0.49 that it cost me (50% off), it was worth it (although its 0.99 euro full price is also not that much). If you enjoy games that focus on exploration, where the story is slowly revealed to you but is well worth the wait, then I highly recommend this. I enjoyed the atmosphere of loneliness that it evoked, as well as the horror-themed plot which I found quite engaging and sorrowful."

Without spoiling too much, it's about a deep sea diver exploring and revealing the mysteries of a sunken explorer ship from the 19th century.  In this 2 hour adventure, you will be doing some light platforming (although there is one frustratingly difficult jump at the very end), some puzzle solving (often involving pushing crates, pulling levers or stepping into an alternate reality), enjoying a wonderful spooky pixel setting that scares without being too oppressive and revealing the rather Lovecraftian fate of the derelict you are in.  The game could definitely benefit from controller support (Please note that controller support for this game has been patched in after this review has been posted) and some tighter platforming, but Reveal the Deep asks for neither much of your time or your money for what it offers, and I think you should play it."

In general I felt the game has an atmospheric underwater setting with nice lighting effects and ambient sounds.Controlling the diver character is easy enough (with use of arrow-keys and a couple other keys for interaction and toggling a light), though I found it can sometimes be a little fussy with jumps in some spots.The shipwreck seems quite large and I like exploring it. There's a bit of a story that is reveled by finding the occasional letter or note. So far the puzzles I’ve encountered have usually been easy enough to solve with a bit of experimenting and exploring.One weak point I may mention (as I write this review) is a lack of an option to save the game. This can mean that if one had to or wanted to close the game for whatever reason, then progress in a level would be lost, requiring that the whole level would need to be started from the beginning again when next playing. Hopefully the Developer will consider to add in a save option (or at least make some regular checkpoints).Despite some shortcomings with the game, overall, and considering the rather low-price, I think it’s a fun little game. If this type of game interests you and you’re considering to get it, then I would recommended it.Here’s a video of my first look at Reveal the Deep:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=571995189"

The sound design was fantastic, as the creakings of wood, doors closing, and bubbling sounds truely put me in the dark underwater caverns. The level design and puzzles were nothing too fancy, but they were something to get your mind thinking. The story is basically placed in logs and letters written by past passengers in 1901, and the progression of the horrors that the ship contain show in the letters they write, clearly showing fear of the unknown.This game isn't exactly ""scary"", in my terms. Granted, there are a few times when enemies are present, and in turn can give one a jump. However, they don't pose so much as a threat, and more of a way to stress the player (watch their back), or to find a way to solve a puzzle to continue the adventure. It's mostly just the sound design that is meant to place you in a real sunken ship, and it does a very good job.Minor things such as controls, art design, and playability are all totally fine. In general, Reveal the Deep is an interesting 30 minute to possibly an hour game that has great potential, and shows it very well. It's simple, but brings interest well enough to keep the player emursed, and it's just a handful of fun, and for a good price."

,Recommended,411560,21798492,"Posted: 12 March, 2016",all,Brian C. (The Schmaltzy Cynic),"I don't often get dollar-store games from Steam because they tend to be often underdeveloped products and/or not worth my time. Reveal the Deep is something I would consider underdeveloped, yet I felt my time was respected. (For the most part.)Price is something I don't often take into consideration for reviewing the game's quality. However, I do think for an indie team's (or lone developer's) first game on Steam, the price point is low enough that if the game doesn't interest you then you won't have much buyer's remorse.With all that being said, I hope Lazy Monday Games learns a lot from this project to create something more substantial gameplay like The Swapper while also keeping all the great aspects made in Reveal the Deep.A Little More than A Walking SimulatorUnlike games like Home where it has more left to the imagination about horror and the gameplay boiling down to one or two choices, Reveal the Deep has some gameplay and horror elements into its gameplay design. None of which make this game into a full puzzle game, yet it's more enjoyable to play than to watch.The best design decision for RD is how levels/chapters give the impression of free-form exploration without feeling more linear than it actually is. Messages, items, new pathways that lead back to previous areas, etc. improve an otherwise boring experience of going down a linear corridor with horror-ish moments.On a second playthrough, I would probably find the level design more linear than first impressions; however, that's okay because exploration is all about the sense of discovery, which is what the game excels at for its short time.One huge oversight in exploration is how areas are split into chapters. There is nothing of a Metroidvania design between each level nor any reason to replay a past level for deeper insight into the narrative. It also means when you want to quit you'll have to restart the area you last played, which is mitigated by how small these areas are when you rush them. So you'll only have to replay 10 mins at most.The other downside to Reveal the Deep's core gameplay is that other than the exploration there's little else to keep your interest. The puzzles are far too bland and simple to keep you engaged.Needs A Little more SparkThe game's biggest problem when it comes to its puzzles is not that the ideas behind them are terrible; the problem is that they have nothing unique to them or added to make the conventional puzzles act differently.RD's main puzzles boil down to pushing/interacting with blocks either by pushing them or turning on and off your light source. Other puzzles with light horror elements involve using the headlight to fend off monsters. Lights also seem to have a space-time effect for revealing new passageways to explore or notes to read.The light gameplay gimmick could've been enough to make these puzzles more interesting on their own, but the game never commits enough to the idea to make them original. (Similar to a game like Glare that uses the light-mechanic at the start and then completely forgets about it.)This issue is why, if the developer(s) took some lessons from The Swapper, they could center a main mechanic for an entire game as well as giving more playtime for their product while not artificially expanding the game. They could also offer a greater sense of challenge, exploration and character to the gameplay.They could also learn some ways to avoid some of the obvious pitfalls for storytelling in these exploration, horror, puzzle-games that have become all to common tropes now to be avoided.Narrative Quibbles as a PlayerI won't be mentioning spoilers in this section. These are rather criticisms I noticed by how the game reveals its narrative, mechanically as well as the content you find. I'll try to limit my examples to the most obvious problems with some specifics mentioned.The biggest trope this game stumbles across is the same thing you have to ask yourself with H.P. Lovecraft's work: Who is taking the time to draw/write out these notes? Many messages you come across have some detailed images of horrific situations (or make the reader question why are they writing this stuff down) that get in the way of the story. It's easier to swallow when it's some crewmember bored out of his mind doodling some of the crew but harder to accept when tragedies occur.On a similar point, some of the written material is weird. The ending line for all of Isaac's letters is hard to ignore when the events become more immediate. Context clues you find from exploring can be pure nonsense. One example is a random note you'll come across, ""The dinosaurs used to have ears--something that is forgotten by fossil records."" Most of the early clues you find, either environmental designs or the protagonist's thoughts, are relevant to the story in some small way. This is in a stark contrast to these meaningless thoughts.Those are problems I can point to as objective faults of the narrative's design. They don't need to be overhauled, they just need to be handled better so every detail is important and there's just enough explained to keep some mystery in check. (For example, why is it that turning off the light seems to take us back in time? The game never explains this in any way.)On a more personal note, I would advise not following the staple ""Mind is superior to the body; spirit is stronger than physical means"" meaning you find in a lot of artsy games. I've yet to find one game where the handling of that idea wasn't pretentious and it wasn't at odds with what the rest of the game is focused on. Unless there is an immense amount of theming into that idea, then adding it in for the hell of it is worthless.My advice to create a game with meaning is simply this:  Stick to creating a story that has details hidden beneath the surface, leave some details open to the imagination, then let the reader/player come to the conclusions of their own. Those types of stories will ALWAYS be more impactful to the reader, and you won't come off as standing on a soapbox; you'll be making people believe their own messages through your game.Gameplay NitpicksJumping off a ladder at the very top is sometimes need to reach the other side or other ladder. This never felt polished to execute properly.Gauging distances for jumping sometimes required the most pixel-perfect jumps to land. It felt out-of-place for this game.Moments where you need to shine in two directions can seem to be trial-and-error sections.The light-on and light-off animation can feel too slow for some puzzles.It's Not the Best, It's Not the Worst; It's OkayAll these criticisms are said with admiration for what has been achieved so far. I am more often not a fan of horror games, and even the staple jump-scare tactics were effective here as well as the atmospheric horror of the unknown. So coming away from this game with a positive outlook has to mean something from me.In the end, Reveal the Deep is a game you won't regret purchasing if you have some level of interest for its narrative. It won't end with a satisfying conclusion but the hour and a half of playtime you'll experience will be sublime with the feeling of exploration.Even when restarting a chapter, you'll probably beat this game under two hours, which makes me worried for the developers' sake. This is another reason why I think they should take the ideas that work here and make a full-blown game to warrant more purchases as well as people retaining their interest with it.Quality made games like this one need to be commended more often, especially when they don't waste the player's time."

Who new a bunch of pixels could be so spooky?This game has got an incredible atmosphere, a good part of it comes from the excellent sound effects... fantastically immersive (pun intended).After that, it's pretty much Amnesia:- Spooky adventure in a derelict and confined place- Mysterious artifact retrieved from third world country ruined everything- Yourbestonly friend is a torch- You've got no weapons to defend yourself so when something attacks you, you better run- Story comes from parchment papers scattered here and there- Only 2 or 3 jumpscares in the whole game but they are the worst everYup the similarities just keep piling up. But like I said Reveal The Deep is better in my opinion. So that's okay.So...Pros:- Awesome sound- Minimalist albeit cool graphics- Nice game system (turning your light off can reveal secrets, a lot like entering the Dark World in A Link To The Past)- Super spooky- Very Atmospheric- So cheap!Cons:- Short- Visuals are very dark so when you find a piece of paper and want to read it your eyes are gonna have a bad time- Controls not as responsive as they should be- Ending quite a bit disappointingStory is neither good not bad, pretty generic, doesn't matter in my opinion.I'd like at this point to reiterate that I absolutely loved this game.

It has a great athmopshere, it really notices to scare you without your typical jumpscares(there's one in chapter 1 though, although it can be avoided if you don't try to be brave like me andrun towards the hole which the monster is inside. It had a few frustrating puzzles, but nothing too difficult, and nothing that will require you to look up a walkthrough(which I couldn't do anyway because the game does not have windowed mode, and if I use something like Alt+Enter to put the game to hold, bandicam stops recording. I do really hope that they add a windowed mode.It had great graphics, and the light effects are beautiful. The monster designs were really creepy and well done!The game had no music which is a little weird, and what's even weirder is that I did not realize that until I reached the ending. Sound effects were great though!The storyline was really creepy and mysterious, and kept me wondering what was going to happen next, and made me want answers. Most of the time though, the questions were overpowering the answers, although I can't really call anything ''plotholes''. I'm still not 100% sure who the main character was. *WARNING-BIG SPOILERS*I'm assuming he's the person who saved the people that were afraid of the black things, and that he was put to rest or something like that. It really felt like watching a ''15 unexplained mysteries'' type of video on youtube.The gameplay was also good. Some people complained about the main character being too slow, but I thought he was fast enough, and also he is wearing a diving suit and those are really heavy so it wouldn't actually make sense if he was really fast. The monsters were really creepy, and they got me shouting a few times, even though they are not really jumpscares. Pushing boxes was really slow, which I was also fine with, because it made sense. I would probably take more than a year to push those huge iron boxes 1 inch.All in all, this game was so worth the wait. I've been following the project on twitter and I was absolutely in love with it at first sight. I think everyone should give this a try.

It was short, but I prefer to compare length in dollars per hour so I easily got my money's worth. To start, this had an excellent atmosphere, with a combination of sounds, level design, and lighting to really make it solid. I don't play horror games, and I would consider this to be like a thriller, in that it's dark and gets some great ""HOLY F*CK"" moments. The puzzle elements fit well with the idea of the game, and the helmet light mechanic is welcome and refreshing. However, I have a few gripes that aren't necessarily an issue but are a tad annoying. Basically, you can sometimes jump in the air and ladders are wonky. I am a little disappointed in the ending, mostly cause I don't know what the heck happened, but I like the game anyways and it's fun to play in little stints during lunch or something.Oh also my playtime (89 minutes or so) does not accurately reflect how long I have played. I completed the first two chapters when macs were unable to run the game and had to be launched from Terminal. This has been fixed, though i have to admit that it was a little fun to enter in some external commands instead of steam so I didn't mind it."

I don't normally leave reviews but felt it would be irresponsible not to when I enjoyed it so much.One major commendation I have to make is for the sound design.  I'm studying audio engineering at the moment and am extremely impressed by the quality of the sounds.  That coupled with a few things in game really had me momentarily petrified!The graphics work in it is absolutely beautiful, and added to the immersion really well.Atmospheric, simple with no frills, bare bones control system and immersive...took me right back to earlier gaming days where you stopped to think about what you needed to do to progress.  These guys have done a spectacular job with a wee short game.Pros- Simple- Curiousity-inducing background story- Amazing sound design- Makes you genuinely feel like an explorer in a messed up place with eerie graphics and noises that raise the hairs on the back of your neck- Great wee headlamp on/off animation with accompanying sound effect- Clever multiple existence idea- Doesn't introduce you to the game using kid glovesCons(let's face it, every game has it's downsides!)- Save feature mid chapter would be beneficial- Possibly some atmospheric background music would be good- Navigating ladders can be finicky, if you're holding down W/S/up or down when you jump towards a ladder, you occasionally move in the opposite direction...but it's not enough to detract totally from my overall view of the gameI love how I as a gamer wasn't patronised in the introduction to the game.  You're dumped into it and have to figure things out for yourself, something a lot of games fail on for me these days...they over-tutorialise.Anyways, to finish up, if you like the odd jump scare without it being OTT, buy this game.If you appreciate having to think for yourself, buy this game.If you enjoy simple, well thought out games, buy this game.Big thumbs up to the devs and keep up the good work!  Well worth the small price tag to support their work.10/10 Would happily require underwear change again"

I went into this not expecting much from a game with a 50p price tag, but enjoyed it while it lasted. It also made me jump in my seat in a couple of times, which I did not expect, which is a plus.The story goes that you are a deep sea diver exploring a ship wreck of an old 19th (I think) century ship. During your exploration you come across notes detailing the events leading up to the ships wrecking.A good sound design lends itself to creating a spooky atmosphere for the game. The creaks and groans of the shipwreck, along with other strange noises create an eerie atmosphere.The game sports simple visuals as are common of small indie games, but they do not detract from the experience.Gameplay consists of simple platformer and puzzle elements.All in all a short, sweet indie game to sink your teeth into when you have an hour or so to spare."

I hate amnesia type horror gamesor even jump scares in generalbut I don't hate the scary moments in this game and I woudn't even call them jump scares. I guess you could say it has horror elements, but there are some lighthearted moments in this game too. I never felt that I was in any real danger or feel like I was fighting for survival so I wouldn't really consider this a horror game. It's more sad than scary.

For 99 cents at full price you can't pass it up and if a discount comes along then this is a no-brainer purchase for those that enjoy old school gaming drenched in darker themes.  You play as a nameless diver in the 1900s exploring an old sunken ship.  There's not much in the way of prelude and the game drops you right into the action.While lacking an ending or development for the main character, what story there is unfolds over notes, semi-flashbacks and dialogues that appears when searching your environment.  Right from the getgo it's obvious something bad happened to the ship and soon you'll find that you are not alone.  The atmosphere in this game is fantastic with the sound deserving special mention.  It's not a jumpscare fest but it managed to jolt me a few times quite unexpectedly.  You'll hear the creaks n' booms of the bulkheads with appropriate underwater FX, eerie echoing ambience and the leaden footsteps of your character.  You are truly alone in terms of allies.  Reveal the Deep pulls this aspect off nicely, creating tension within the black spaces.This new age of sideview horror adventures has created several graphically unique masterpieces and while Reveal the Deep isn't quite among the best looking, the visuals are well-done.  The sparse, pixelated setting has enough detail in the backgrounds, floors and brooding lower sections of the ship to make it hard to look away even when your pulse is picking up the pace.  Though the main character isn't especially detailed, he's got a certain charm in his minimalism that keeps you concerned for his safety.  You will encounter a few creatures along the way and they too are rather creepy in a less is more fashion that suits them well to the environments and situations.The gameplay isn't ground breaking but it's effective with a few neat flourishes sprinkled throughout.  As you explore you'll need to solve puzzles to progress, search thoroughly for bits of backstory and keep your wits about you.  Nothing is too difficult to accomplish yet there's just enough challenge and segments to engage your wits which gives advancement a satisfying feel.  You can crouch, jump, push objects and tap your helmet to turn your lights on and off.  The helmet mechanic was particularly cool because whether your headlamp is on or off changes the way that you view your surroundings and warps the ship from past to present where notes will suddenly appear, the ghosts of the crew and passengers will call out to you and previously inaccessible areas will become accessible.  There are also switches to pull, obstructions that need to be removed by finding glowing orbs and a small smattering of doors that can only be opened with a key.  Also certain platforms will only operate when switching betwixt past/present time tense.  This mixture of exploration, puzzles, platforming and story keeps the game engaging for its short run-time.  A couple of the puzzle situations are slightly obtuse but careful attention to detail should ensure that most players won't need a walkthrough to beat the game.Finally, you'll have to figure out how to deal with a few of the ship's current denizens who are less than happy with your presence, in addition to dodging some deadly traps.  It probably won't happen often, but you CAN die in Reveal the Deep.  Death doesn't punish your progress too much, though you'll be setback to a predetermined checkpoint.  The game only saves permanently after completing a chapter.  None of them are too lengthy, requiring perhaps a half hour a piece to complete give or take.  I spent 4 hours with the game because I searched every single nook and cranny to uncover the backstory and paused for roughly an hour to take care of some stuff for work.  For the price, the length is just right and I really had alot of fun playing this little game.The experience is not without some flaws and some weakpoints in the hull.  While the story is well-revealed throughout, the ending feels like quite a copout and was certainly a letdown.  I didn't expect much for 99 cents but it's surely a head-scratcher in need of some Head and Shoulders.  It's a minor gripe for certain.  The bigger gripe is that the controls can be fluttery and sent me spiraling into a few accidental deaths and oopses.  Jumping works well most of the time, and other times you can't seem to get your character to jump anywhere but straight up as if he's tied to a nice bushel of balloons.  You'll probably have a difficult time wrangling ladders as well and jumping off of them can be an even bigger migraine that the basic platforming.  Still, nothing is purely broken...it can be annoying but shouldn't induce too much foul language.  I've heard of some glitches reported which thankfully I really didn't encounter.  This is a sweet little gem all around...Pros:-Fun gameplay with a nice mixture of platforming, adventure and puzzling.-Great setting, atmosphere and ambience.-Superb sound FX.-Well-done graphics that suit the game nicely.-Story build-up is a nice touch.-Horror touches are subtley creepy and implemented with care (a slow burner instead of a jumpscare fest).-Diving headlamp and past/present time switches are a unique feature.-Great price!Cons:-Mostly solid controls but certainly on the flighty side (jumping and ladder climbing are a pain).-Short.  The game is fun enough that an extra level or two would have been nice.-A one and doner.-Weak ending.-A few slight frame slowdowns experienced in inhabited areas.Overall:  7.6/10Despite my criticisms I am very glad that I picked up Reveal the Deep, horror fans that enjoy the side-scrolling revival should absolutely pick this up.  At 99 cents it was more than worth my money and if you can get it on discount then the value is ridiculous.  I'm a sucker for horror games and old school games (being a gamer born in '82); Reveal the Deep combines the best of both worlds.  With a great setting, an entertaining gameplay mix, haunting sound, intriguing sci-fi/horror short story type of atmosphere and just the right length, Reveal the Deep should most certainly please the audience it's aimed at.  I had a lot of fun with this game and it left me wanting more, which is never a bad thing.  In the odd chance that a sequel pops up, I will not hesitate to play it!"

I definitely recommend this game.Now for more detail. Reveal The Deep does ambiance incredibly well by using sounds and atmosphere to it's advantage. You play as an unknown protagonist who uses the light in their deep sea suit to explore a ship submerged under the ocean, which I am sure you can gather from the videos you may have already seen. The controls are very simplistic. Walk left,right,crouch, and jump. However, there is a feature in the game that allows you to turn on/off your light. Which, when done in certain areas, allows you to see the room you are in as if it were still perfectly fine. This mechanic allows the game to not only be creepy, but to also make much of the game a puzzle as you work your way through the ship trying to discover what exactly happened by finding notes and various forms of information.I got this game when it was on sale but even at full price I think the game is worth it and I am happy to add it to my library.

Lack of music makes the underwater sounds all the more unnerving. I didn't think I would scare or startle, but did have a moment or two where I jumped a little. Definitely play with the lights off and headset on.The narrative of the story, assuming you find all the notes is not too bad and lets you put the pieces together moreso than outright telling you, still the ending felt like it was missing something. I can't quite put my finger on it. Though if the game had gone on much more, it would have needed additional gameplay elements to make it interesting. All and all, an enjoyable way to spend a few hours.(A bug did cause me to become trapped in the middle of the game, resulting in me having to restart the chapter. Considering the chain of events that needed to align to cause me to become trapped, it's probably a minor thing that most will never encounter. Still, it was frustrating and I was just going to quit, but figured I was close to finishing and replaying the parts I had already done wouldn't take too long.)"

There's also nothing very scary about the game, but the atmosphere sets a tone like you will expect something to jump out at any point.Unlike other reviewers, I didn't have an issue with the game chapter restarting on death, and it put me back one or two screens usually so I didn't lose progress.

The only problem that I have with this game is the menu... They really have to work that out!Now... About the game. You're a little guy in a special suit and you explore a sinked ship. You'll understand why I say 'special' suit when you play the game, at first it is not quite obvious, but after you're playing it for a while you'll get it. While you explore the ship you'll solve puzzles, discover letters (which tell you the story) and get scared a bit (I got scared in Chapter 1 :) ). The fact that you can't actually close the game because you'll lose all progress of the current chapter you're playing is a bit annoying, but I'll call it a 'feature' because it actually makes you pay attention to the story and it captivates you more in it. This game is short so it doesn't need a 'save' feature. You're stuck at 'Chapter 2' and you have to go? Big deal! When you come back, you'll restart Chapter 2 and relive the experience, you'll pay more attention and live the story at its fullest.So... I'd recommend you to buy this game!"

The sound...the everything...it's like you were going to die.The long experience (if you have no clue what you're doing) really wears you down.

,Not Recommended,411560,29172774,Posted: 10 January,all,devential,"Reveal The Deep is an amazingly atmospheric game, but unfortunately falls short to unaddressed launching issues and its length. Not too bad for the price, though.In Reveal The Deep, you play a diver who explores a shipwreck, uncovering the story and fate of the ship through notes and logs left by its former occupants in various rooms. You also have the ability to somehowgo back in timeto a less derelict state of the ship, revealing books, items, and the like, by turning off your headlamp which activates lamps in the ship's rooms. Needless to say, you aren't exactly alone once you get to exploring.Having dived into little wrecks myself, I'd say the game pretty much captures the general uneasiness that I would personally get when underwater: the uncertainty of whatever lies beyond the void untouched by my light, the confusion that you would get finding your bearings, which makes it much more difficult in real life to navigate underwater, and in-game a little more challenging to solve the little puzzles, being that I found myself often unsure whether I've been in a particular room before (or that might have just been the game toying with me). The little puzzles themselves aren't that challenging to begin with, but with the tense atmosphere around you, you might not want to get too ruffled anyway. The story is great, interesting at the very least, and the variety of notes that you get to encounter are good little reads that flesh out more and more of the story.Where the game fails are on more technical issues. It's been stated in the update logs that patches have fixed startup issues on several platforms, with the last patch (as of this writing) being released in April 2016. Now nine months after that, I was surprised to find that I still had launch issues via the Steam app! The fact that it's been so long since this was properly patched is a very worrying sign from the dev for me. Fortunately, getting around to launching the game was little more than a minor annoyance (you have to navigate to the game's install directory, open the 'Linux' folder and run the .jar file. You may or may not need the Java Development Kit; in my case it ran right off the bat. YMMV), albeit leaving a pretty bad taste in my mouth.It's also short. Only three chapters, and the long wait since the last patch really makes me doubt that the dev would add anything more, if not in a sequel. For the price, however, you might consider it worth at least what you pay for it.ProsVery atmospheric, immersive worldGreat storySimple platforming puzzles compounded by tense, confusing atmosphereHeck, it's pretty cheapConsLaunch issues on some platforms that have not been addressed in monthsA bit on the short side (you get what you pay for)Verdict:For this cheap, it shouldn't hurt much to give it a try. However, given its current state and lack of any recent updates (for a game released just last year!), I'd pass on this one if ever I'd buy it again."

The second chapter's challenges are more about reflexes and luck (sometimes enemy placement can screw you over with no way for you to do anything about it).

Hell, I didn't even get to complete it because I was stuck on a level. It is very boring and there is absolutely no clues or help so you will be looking around pointlessly.Pros:-The atmosphere is absolutely wonderfull.-An art style that reminds you of older games.-Its ONLY a dollarCons:-Tedious and boring.-Might have trouble starting up.-Required software doesn't come pre-installed.-Horrible controls. Make you feel like you are playing on an arcade machine.-Challenges are difficult and it isn't rewarding at all.-Couldn't beat it because near the end some levels are IMPOSSIBLE!-You get what you pay for. 1 dollar worth of games.-Horrible options menu. Only lets you change G quality to Low High and Medium.-Uses arrow keys unless you use the horrible options menu to bind it to WASD.-Offers no features to make you ever want to play it.Final Word:You get what you pay for.

Just 51.42% of its owners haveeverlaunched it.The average total playtime is 44 minutes, with the median coming in at a paltry 19 minutes played.Take Steam reviews with a grain of salt. If Reveal the Deep were truly a great game, 88.65% of its players wouldn't forget about it within fourteen days. This isn't one of those games that one must ""make time for."" It isn't so ""deep"" that it ""takes time to get into."" It's simply not good.I stand by my initial review.Reveal the Deep is the first game that I ever felt the need to get a refund for.The game cost me just $0.99, and I still want my money back.First of all, the game fails to provide the player with any contextual information in regard to who they are and what they're doing. Logos, ethos, and pathos are completely ignored; meaning, I am not drawn into Reveal the Deep either logically, ethically, or emotionally. In my 22 minutes with the game, I was given neither concrete nor intuitive information as to what (or why) I'm doing.Many games are like that. So what?To say Reveal the Deep moves at a snail's pace is an understatement. There is zero action to make up for the player's waning interest level. It takes your submariner longer to do things in-game than it takes a real deep-sea explorer to do the same thing in actual water. Switching ""views"" in your helmet takes at least an entire second; unfortunately, the amount of times one must switch said ""view"" is too great for the one-second wait to go unnoticed.How Reveal the Deep has accumulated a positive rating of 92% is beyond me. If darkness and a handful of underwater sound effects constitute ""atmosphere,"" I suppose a game needs more than atmosphere to be worth owning. Reveal the Deep, in my opinion, isn't worth owning for even the price of a vending-machine snack."

You'll need to finish each level in a sitting, or leave the game idling in the background-- but again, the levels are fairly short. If you do manage to off yourself in play, you'll be resurrected a short, safe distance away, with none of your progress affected.

O controle é um pouco 'pesado' (o que é frustrante, as vezes), mas acredito que seja por causa da pesada roupa do personagem. Em geral, o jogo me lembra o bom e velho ""Lone Survivor"" (motivo pelo qual o comprei). O preço é justo pelo que ele oferece.NOTA (09/04/2016): No final do jogo, o jogo permitiu que eu progredisse para uma área que não tinha como voltar.

Both work well together to conjure up a mysterious but relaxing atmosphere. Encountered a jump scare in the first 20 minutes. Don't know why but I walked back into it and it happened again. Spooky. Great value for 49 cents (purchased during a sale).The headlight toggle element is very clever and easy to learn. Visuals are very nice to look at.I recommend this if you like atmospheric exploration games.Some suggestions to the developer:I found getting off of the top of some ladders to be very clumsy. Climbing upwards when hitting the top of the ladder should allow me enough height to jump off onto the ground on the other side. On some ladders, reaching the top made me jump a little bit but not enough to get over the ladder, so I found myself having to try repeatedly (playing with keyboard).Please add some sort of snapshot save feature. My first impression of the game is great but it might not be worth starting from the beginning if I didn't end up finishing a chapter.If practical, a game speed slider would be nice as my little diver walks quite slowly. I understand this may sacrifice some of the atmospheric element but I do not plan to ramp up the game speed much anyway. Just want to put a spring in his step."

Its a really great horror game if you're not into jumpscares and are more into atmospheric horror.Be sure to read all the notes you come across, they tell the story and add to the overall atmosphere.The only con i'd say is there isn't an effective way of saving. The chapters themselves are relatively short but I admit with the first chapter I had to put it down and lost a lot of progress."

The ambience was incredible: the hisses, creaks and groans of the ship made me feel claustrophobic and very, very paranoid. (You probably should be as the enemy you face is essentially a more lethal version of the Hide-Behind.)

Several times I had to stop playing to catch my breath, I was so scared.In spite of the incredible gameplay, there are a couple of things I'd change. I hate that you can't save during a chapter, which means if you want to stop playing you lose all your progress and have to go to the beginning. Also, the text which displays kind of seems out of place. Bright, white generic font doesn't really match the game's aesthetic too well.Regardless, this is an amazing game.

Desgin flaws: Needs a save option and ability to change screen resolution.Old complaints, now fixed as of 2015.12.17:First, there are no instructions (unless I am missing something). I initially found only five controls: the four directional arrows, and the spacebar. The spacebar causes your helmet lamp to come on and off, and at times turning it off revealed other sources of illumination. Had I not read the other reviews, I'd have just said ""screw this!"" and played something else. However, I eventually found that P and the shift-key also cause things to happen.Second, evidently there is no ability to remap the keys (I am a WASD man, dammit!).Third, there is no way to alter the screen size. As I result, I can't actually turn off the game from inside the game, but instead have to CTRL-ALT-TAB out. Nor can I read all the letter I just found to ""Dear Alice"" dated 1901.Still, the price wasn't bad. Hopefully the developer reads this and provides a means for selecting the screen resolution.

You are just thrown into this game with this amazing atmosphere and setting where the plot is barely brought up until the end of the first chapter.

Also, a little side note, I have found that playing this game at night with all the lights off and headphones on to be the best setting. The sound effects and low lighting design makes it ideal for playing late at night. Overall a really fun game, and a really unique one in terms of setting and gameplay. If you can catch it on sale don't hesitate (I think I got it for .50 cents). It’s always great to see small developers pushing the boundaries of what makes a good game.

There's more to gameplay than just avoiding the monsters here and pushing a crate there. It may be a simple pixellated platforming game, but the story sticks with you even after it's over. For less than a dollar, it's definitely worth your time."

When it comes to video games, I put a lot of value in whether a game gives itself the right mood. the right mood can be accomplished with music/sounds (or the lack of them) graphics and story. if you want a good game all of these have to match up, and even if the game is fun if it doesn't match up, its not going to be a good game.Now understand when I say that this game isn't 'fun'. it has some puzzles here and there, but the main reason you're doing them is to explore, not to have 'fun'. The mood and story are the selling points of this game.The game itself consists of you walking around the wreckage of a ship, while finding things that reveal the story of its past to you. Hence the title, 'Reveal the Deep'. and thats really all it is. the game is divided into chapters, and all you do is explore. no powerups or anything. the closest thing to powerups are keys.If you dont like scary games, dont buy this game.If you love scary games, buy this game.if you're not sure, buy this game and by the end of it you will know if you like them or not. or maybe not by the end of it, depends how long you stick through it.Im really not good with scary games and I find good value in this game."

Level and sound design are both outstanding. Creator of this game knew where to dedicate their time.CONsHas some painful accessibility issues such as no saving, no mouse usage, and no controller support. Also points off for requiring me to download a new Java version."

The sound effects constantly had me on edge, and I certainly was not expecting light mechanics aside from your average ""flashlight"". One of the only major gripes that I have with the game is a block-pushing segment in Chapter 2 that was a slog thanks to my body blocking the block's light, forcing me to constantly stop and turn around to not get killed.+ Length of game fits its price.+ Sound effects were on point.+ Interesting usage of a toggleable light source.+ Only rarely resorted to jumpscares.+ The location of the final journal entry blew my mind given how deep I thought I travelled.- Block-pushing segment in Chapter 2 becomes a slog if you're unlucky with enemy placement.- Some instances of cheap enemy placement; impossible to see before falling into their hurtbox.- Block-pushing sound effect has an obvious point where it loops.- A few glitches and bugs, but nothing gamebreaking; jumping in a tight corridor and on top of some rising blocks will keep you in the jumping animation, forcing you to jump again in a larger room in the case of the former or land on solid ground in the case of the latter to resume your usual animations; had one case where trying to walk underneath a rising block with spikes underneath it killed me out of the blue.All in all, I would recommend giving this a try if you have some trading card money to spare and fancy a short horror experience."

One warning however, you must have Java installed in order to play, I didn't know this until I had already bought it and tried starting it up. Its a bit annoying, and I wish I wouldn't have had to, but it's worth it regardless."

You play as an explorer who is going through a shipwreck and slowly piecing together the story through diary entries.The gameplay and controls are simple. There are just a few puzzles but you won’t struggle with them. It’s mostly about the story and atmosphere here. There is no music and the only main sound effects are your footsteps and the creaking / moaning of the ship. It does make for a creepy and fairly lonely feeling.You’re able to switch back and forth, at certain points, to a time before the ship was destroyed. Some things are there before the wreck, like extended ledges and walls to progress you through the story. A simple and neat mechanic.The game doesn’t rely on jump scares. There were one or two moments where I was startled but that’s it.The default key binding is an odd choice. There is an option in the game to re-assign the keys but it just didn’t work.There is no save option during a chapter. Luckily they are short enough that you can finish one in a single sitting.Java error upon launchIf you get an error about needing Java 1.7 but already have a later version installed, double check you have the 32bit version installed. I only had the 64bit version loaded. Installed the latest 32bit Java client and it worked fine. No need to uninstall the 64bit one, you can run them simultaneously.Pros+60fps+Creepy atmosphere+Simple gameplay+StoryCons+Re-assigning keys didn’t work+BacktrackingA short and sweet game that has an interesting story and simple game mechanics.5/10Average"

The atmosphere is creepy as heck and really builds tension when it gets to the point of ""something is going to happen soon, I just know it.."". I'm a sucker for simple graphics and the noises in the background put you on edge, making you wonder if THAT one time is the 'thing' that will come after you. My only complaints are that the main character can be really slow, especially when you need to loop around once or twice to complete the puzzle, and the fact that there's no real save system in it. The chapters are good-sized but you lose your progress if you exit out halfway through. No saves at all. I didn't finish the second chapter and so I need to start that over in order to finish. ;-;?For those who don't know, you need the Java Developer Kit, and then you need access to your Terminal to run it.This thread helped me figure it all out:http://steamcommunity.com/app/411560/discussions/0/485624149165117032/And voila. I told you it was a bit of a hassle. Not bad for the price though? I bought it when it was on sale for 49 cents, so I didn't mind the extra effort once I actually found the answer to get it running. Pretty cool."

I dont normally enjoy maze games but this one had a good story keeping me going. Sort of a♥♥♥♥♥♥off when the filler of the game was made up of time consuming tasks, like pushing blocks. Then you would get lost in the maze and end up needing to push the same block around multiple times. That was a little teeth grinding but all in all, 11/16 thumbs up!"

To my surprise, on the previous page, at the exact spot the cursor is on, there is the button'quit (lose all progress)'and appearently I double clicked on back, resulting in almost an hour of my life going to waste. First of all, what the ♥♥♥♥ is that? Who the hell places a lose all progress buttonwithout second confirmationon a menu?Then I checked discussions and realizedthere isn't a save button in game.If you want to close the game, you will have to start all over when you come back.No game is worth that. Especially considering even if you can (and willing to) finish the game all at once you have a high chance of restarting it accidentally when checking the menu.I honestly have no idea how this game has so many positive reviews,if you are willing to buy, just check discussions.Half of the customers can't even start the game to begin with, and it seems developers are not gonna do anything about it.Just because you are selling it for a cheap price doesn't mean you can make it cheap too."

I think it was something from adobe.RTD is more suspense than anything for a while until the creatures start showing themselves more often. I got turned around a few times, but after paying attention to both ""sides"" of the world and learning the layout it went pretty well. There is no option to save freely anywhere and the game only saves at the end of a chapter.Reveal the Deep is an okay horror game. The price is right, and there are two endings. The story is probably the best thing about it, as you find out where the creatures came from and how the ship sank. But that's it."
