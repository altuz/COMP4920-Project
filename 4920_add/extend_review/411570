,Not Recommended,411570,18685629,"Posted: 25 October, 2015",all,Talon,"TL;DR: If you are a hardcore fan of the series and need another CYOA game to play through, I would grudgingly recommend it. While not necessarily compelling, the story is adequate and the writing is good. However, if you are just starting the choice of games series or are considering this because of the zombie narrative I would recommend against playing it. If you are interested in a long CYOA game, try tin star instead. A+ narrative and gameplay, and much more replayability.I'll preface this review by saying I've played every choice of games that has been released on steam and I have loved each and every one of them. Zombie exodus is a solid choose your own adventure game, in the same vein as all of their previous releases. However, I am sad to say that I don't recommend this game.At first glance, the game seems to have everything I love in it. Zombie apocalpyse, variety of characters to befriend or betray, and a decent selection of starting ""classes"". Yet as I read through it, I became increasingly dissatisfied with the choices. Before each mission, you have the option to take a variety of weapons with you. However, I soon realized that the weapons you choose, aside from the various utility options, have absolutely no impact on the story. The shotgun, pistol, rifle, AK, etc. all lead to the same result as did the melee weapons. While the flavor text changed, the outcomes remained the same. I would have preferred it if the weapons you choose had an impact on your progression. Also the fact that you apparently have an unlimited amount of each made the trading aspect worthless, as you didn't need to consider the consequences of trading away an AK or rifle for medicine. When you got to the next mission, you'd once again have everything you traded away.That alone wouldn't be enough for me to not recommend the story though, as the writing was solid and my favorable predisposition towards choice of games and zombie games in general kept me interested. However, the character relationships also left much to be desired. Even if someone in the group hates you (low disposition score) they would still come to your aid in discussions or battles and essentially nothing changed between low and high disposition scores. This made the relationships in the game seem meaningless. I mean, why have those stats if it doesn't change any of the outcomes?Finally, (slight spoliers) were the ghost scenes. I am fine with suspending disbelief for the zombie apocalypse, but given that the nature of the disease was viral, it seems counterproductive towards the environment of the game to have supernatural elements in it. These scenes didn't really add anything to the story and in my opinion, weakened its narrative.By the time I reached act V of the story, I found myself bored and unimpressed. A choose your own adventure story that is essentially without graphics (some sketches were present) and music needs a compelling narrative and meaningful choices in order to be effective. Without it, it begins to bog down. And sadly, this game did exactly that."

People believe that this isn't considered a ""game"". If you don't like reading text-based games than this isn't for you. This is my favorite one from the rest of the Choice of Games. So many endings means more playing for me. I am going to add more stuff now because I've played this game enough to say more.Pros+ Able to save some people from dieing (of course not everyone can live)+ Hidden weapons+ Gay relationships ;) (Ooooohh yeaahhhh)+ A lot of endings that some are easy/hard to achieve+ Choose your job (This helps with some endings)+ Choosing the right weapons that can save you from death (I'll come back to this in cons)+ Stats will sometimes prevent you from choosing certain actions, which is goodCons- Most of your missions require you to bring weapons, but it doesn't matter- Trading weapons/food doesn't matter because you'll gain them back- Relationships have little effect (Being hated by others, but will still follow you)- Little to no illustrations later on- Some decisions don't have a big impact- Girlfriends/Boyfriends will mostly leave you heartbroken (Oooooohhhh noooooo)In ConclusionI'm deciding if I should do all achievements. Again, this is a text-based game. If you don't like that than you shouldn't buy this. This game is great to kill time. Finally,I recommendbuying this game."

I think fans of zombies will definitely enjoy this.There are periodic game saves applied automatically, in case you get yourself killed. The difficulty isn't extreme or anything, but it did help to have a few mulligans handy.There is an element of replay value, since there are several character types, as well as (I'm guessing) several types of ending.As long as you approach this knowing that it is text-only, with a few illustrations, and simply choices to make along the way, I think you won't be disappointed."

Skyried |171CB|,"Needless to say, this game isn't for everyone in this generation and the coming generations as text based games seem to be in decline along with reading in general...But regardless of that, this game is a gem for those who do enjoy it. Its narrative is interesting albiet somewhat predictable. The writing is nothing fancy, but that does make it approachable. I have a few minor gripes with some of the writing style and errors (I recommend the devs proof read some of their work xD ) as they do detract from the immersion along with the actions by some of the characters within the story seem extremely unrealistic.But with the pricing, it reminds me of the days that I use to buy the Choose Your Own Adventure gamebooks from brick and Mortar stores._Pros_-Fun and Interesting Story-Some Nifty artwork-Choices are varied and nice-Replayability-Decent descriptive language usage-Easy to navigate UI_Cons_- Some writing errors- Consistency issues- Character Reaction realism (apparently years of Military training mean nothing.)- some stale character development- out of character actions(personal gripe, author obviously does not know guns very well... there is made mention of a clip [which should have been a magazine] and the M1911 is stated as a Remington firearm...)"

The first is the excellent Choice of Robots. So you can imagine I would compare ZE with CoR.Unlike CoR has branching stories, ZE is a linear story. In ZE, choices you make impact on how you do things. More like traditional CYOA book, you either success or die (and load save) and proceed to the same next storyline. e.g. In one senario, if you are captured, it is game over instead of branching. <- It is a shame the writer didn't add the captued senario, I don't mind if still leads to the same next part.States do not seem matter much. Compare to CoR where states are very important that it unlocks new branches, again ZE is either-you-die-or-make-it so just die and load and proceed.Minor issues:Transitions between scenes sometimes are not smooth.Burrowed few ideas from Walking Dead so some senario can be a bit predictable but which zombie story wouldn't. :PPSThe review was initially negative out of the pricing & my personal preference of game/story design, now I have learnt that it is possible to play on their website too even I bought on Steam and played more with better understanding of the game, I switched from No to Yes."

The writing is definitely above average, the adventure is long, and there's many choices and branchings to the story which boost replayability value a lot.But the most important thing: It feels ""real"" - like a good season of ""The Walking Dead"" would.I bought ""Zombie Exodus"" at a discount, but after the fact I'd say, depending on how you look at it, it can be well worth the 8 bucks full price. For this, you mustn't see ""Zombie Exodus"" as a computer game, though. It's not about the software, not about graphics, sound etc - the usual bells and whistles.

It's cool that when you pick your profession you get special choices unlocked and sometimes they will benefit you greatly. The zombie action is satisfatory, the other survivors have fairly interesting backgrounds and personalities, and I'm glad the feature to return to a previous save is an option. Many CYOA games do not have this option, so if you take a wrong turn somewhere and end up getting eaten by a zombie then it's okay and you can try it again differently!Now for the few complaints I have:-The ending was a bit unsatisfactory-The ""romance"" relationships seemed a little rushed-Some unexplained parts in the story, a few loose ends that never really got tied up (whether that was my own fault for certain choices I made or just a flaw in the writing, I cannot say)Other than those few issues I had, I really enjoyed the game.

These words, have never rung so falsley, I have played my fair share of CYOA, and almost all of them, span for only around three hours at most, normally with a second playthrough. But this behemoth, this magnificent behemoth of a game, clocked in at over seventeen hours.To be honest, I bought this purely because I bought Safe Haven first, and now playing this game, it was well worth the money, all the characters where likable, even Heather and Devlin the two who were made to be unlikable still came across as charming characters with their flaws and it only made the losses of any character that more painful. Even token side characters who you knew were destined to be in the story for at most two chapters still were loveable and if anything because of their shortness the loss of them in the story resounded so much more, with such little development compared to characters like Emma or Heather, it made me feel even more, wanting to know more about them, how they survived, did they want that damn Truck. Each character really feels like just that, a character to love and cherish.And this is all pulled together through amazing writing, few times did I notice a rehashed line, the only exception with choosing a loudout, though that is to be forgiven since you are experimenting with loudouts quite often, how many times can they describe a fifty foot coil of rope? Not too many times I imagine. But all thsi writing would be wasted on without a good overarching narrative. And did it have one? Yeah.It is generic, by lord is it generic, but the writing style makes up for it and genericisim is never a bad thing. If done right it can become a great literary tool, something this honestly is. But overall, Ten out of Ten would play again."

,Recommended,411570,18875398,"Posted: 4 November, 2015",all,MC-Gamer,"Zombie Exodus is a text based game putting you in the middle of a zombie apocalyse. Now, I, as well as many others, steer clear of text based games due to them not being as fun as other games, however I was genuinely surprised by how well this game was done. The decisions in this rival those in Telltale's The Walking Dead, and you really do have to make hard decisions. Unlike Telltale's The Walking Dead, this game has 9 possible endings, many character's survival relies solely on your decisions, and your decisions REALLY DO MATTER.The game starts off quite slow, but quickly builds up to life in a world full of zombies, bandits, and other dangers coming from every angle.I rate this game at 9/10, and the reasons it doesn't get 10/10 are listed below:1. A couple of plot points don't get resolved (depending on which ending you get). Some pretty major things happen towards the end of the game, and depending on your choices, you may or may not find out what happens/happened. I know it counts towards the realism, but when someone betrays you, and you never find out who, or when someone stays behind, and you never find out if they live or not, it kinda feels like the loose ends needed wrapping up.2. A lot of the decisions come down to ""Pick the smart option"". This is something I like. However there is one point where the writer trades in the ""Zombie survival"" element for an Indiana Jones-style action sequence.3. The epilogue is kinda rushed and forced. I got an ending with 9 survivors, and then the game wrapped up with 5 pages set 5 years later telling me how each of them died randomly, and gave a lot of information that wasn't needed. It's kinda like if you watched the first 5 seasons of The Walking Dead, and then had everything past that summarised in 10 pages at the end of the season 5 finale. I would've much rather had a sequel, or DLC (which is something I don't say often).All in all, this game was highly enjoyable, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys Zombie stories, or interactive story and character driven games."

Zombie: Exodus has none of  these features and instead features a very linear story. I feel quite bait and switched given the implication in Safe Haven of skills and resource managment. The game itself is short and has some choices you can make, however they hardly alter the story and towards the end all choices kill you unless it is the option the devs want you to take. A more involved plot with more variety in gameplay, non-linear storytelling and more pictures would really bump this type of game up.

The story is well told, but feels rushed at moments which can spoil the mood a little. A bit more patience from the writer, or detail describing the scene(s) might do the trick.Besides the point that you might have a better idea to handle certain situations that ask for a choice; all events come up with options which are varied enough to please any kind of reader/gamer.  So, there's no shortage regarding that.All in all I can only recommend this book, because it has a very nice touch to it and is really fun to read.Oh, and another thing. you won't be finishing this within the hour. Zombie Exodus is a pretty big adventure worth your time."

Zombie Exodus is kind of like that.PROSThe story is descriptive and immersive if you take the time to sit down and let it, if not a little rushed feeling and lacking pacingMultitude of choices that you can makeOccasionally you get an illustration - most of which are creepy and well-drawn and add to the environment of the storyYou can find items that can help or in some cases allow to completely bypass some situations making going out of your way to explore valuable. Just make sure you don't run into any Zombies, or worse...CONSThe game could have set the mood better, with the plain white background and no music/sounds reading becomes kind of redundant. A 'lights off' function like a lot of ereaders have would be a welcomed improvement and you can also just turn on your own stuffMusic Recommendationshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BeicGsv0JYhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6OtF7daIPMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNA-TD3F6uQBooks?

But seriously, unless you’re a reader and/or interested in Zombies enough to want to read through a 750,000-word novel this probably isn't going to be a game for you.Zombie Exodus could do heavily with a narrator.

The overly used ""you"" and many grammar errors, the badly made skills set. I mean, i'm a soldier who trained a lot firing with different weapons, but i find myself uncapable of hitting 1 hit kill at any given moment. This is ridiculous. Also, the close quarters combat is almost impossible, since even if it is one-on-one, there are parts the the zombie will overcame your powers, embrancing you while eating your flesh. And i've tried multiple times at the same part, with a combat knife, with a chivalry sword, even an spiked bat. It could be good, but it isn't. I gotta admit though, although i did not like the ""book"" at it's  plenitude, the path between the beginning and the end was slightly pleasant."

Sure, you can start the game in later chapters you've gotten to, but without the inventory you brought with you or any impact on your humanity carrying over...

Was having a good time until I put it down, convincing myself ""that CAN'T BE what they mean, that all your progress is deleted every time you restart) -- came back to see indeed the game delivers on an entirely different nightmare than promised, then I uninstalled.To not implement a means to save progress in a game like this, on steam... is just disgusting and lazy.

The fact that it's 6 bucks on sale is already insulting enough for a non-game, the creator didn't even bother to put any kind of images or graphics in it to make it worth while, it's all put on a white background the whole time with the same font. And this is not the first time non-games like this manage to get through the Steam Greenlight, but I can assure you this is one of the worse out there. Heck, even a hentai game made by russians  are better than this thing, and they are free.This is the state of gaming we have here today, it's either overblown PR-campaign rehash from a big-name company or another over-priced text adventure or rogue-like ""game"" from indie developer. I seriously don't have any more expectation on the gaming industry anymore (and yes it's gaming industry because they keep churning out the same bland♥♥♥♥♥♥all over again until the end of time like a perverted factory).

,Recommended,411570,25758275,"Posted: 28 September, 2016",all,Battlelord17,"I honeslty enjoy this game.It's a very good piece of interactive fiction, and I really enjoy those kinds of games. Some may not, and that's their choice, but personally, I find the classic nature of a good text-adventure to be relaxing and exciting at the same time.The Pros:1. The story is actually pretty well written. You get a sense of both who your character is as they develop, along with the supporting characters of the tale.2. There are a lot of different choices to make, each with it's on rewards aand consequences. This adds a lot to the story as it progresses, but I will touch on this again in the Cons.3. The game brings a general creeping feeling, as you're playing. You never know what is going to happen around the next corner. Whether you will live or die; make a good or bad choice for a scenario and defines your character in a different light. Things can take a turn for the worst at any second, and it keeps you on your toes.The Cons:1. The story itself may be enough to keep you going, but I sometimes felt the narrative was a bit wordy. I feel, in IF anyway, that you should be shorter in sentences, and deliver the majority of the details in quick sentences, rather than long narratives. Another problem that I found was that the writer needs to deliver more of the ""show, don't tell"" rhetoric that most writers use. Could help in the long run.2. As I stated above, I would come back to the choices. While there are plenty of choices, some of them have no effect on the story itself. Such as weapon choice at the beginning. Honestly, I found no change in my actions when playing a character with a rifle, or a character with a knife. Just an observation, and probably nit-picky, but I digress.Overall, this was an exceptional game and I really enjoyed playing it. I definitely recommend it for the text-adventure lovers out there, and any zombie survival fans."

I won't say much about the story to avoid spoiling it for you, but here's some features:-You choose a background at the start of the game, which will help you throughout the game.-The game starts out alittle slow, then gets really intense as you struggle to survive.-The character interaction is excellent. They feel unique and real, not just generic survivers. A few characters in particular really made me doubt my choices, and completely ruined my plans lol.-Alot of the game is interacting with survivors. There's really good seemingly random encounters.-9 different endings, with multiple achievements and secret achievements.-I usually find these types of games too short (3-6 hours), but my first play through was 16 hours! Really looking forward to playing again and doing things differently.-I got it on sale, but I think it's well worth the full $9 (in Canada) price."
