,Recommended,411600,21563703,"Posted: 1 March, 2016",all,Turkey Chili,"The Sentient is an amazing new scifi strategy/sim/management/roguelike indie game that oozes potential.  The devs are great about listening to the players and seem to have a genuine desire to put out a great game.  As with most Early Access titles, there are some bugs to be worked out.The battle gameplay is engaging and the story is interesting and immediately draws you in from the instant you start the intro.  The graphics and sound are solid and the gameplay seems very smooth and optimized.  I feel I most definitely got my money's worth purchasing on release day and the thought that it will be improved and expanded on has me very optimistic for the future of this title."

How?  Just because you jump from sector to sector with a static ship does not make it FTL-like.Very repetitous.The plotline doesn't really make sense... an all powerful AI that needed to be invited? And its not really doing anything.I think the thing that pushed me to thumbs down is the arbritary killing off of my crew, because of static blind choices.Its a great idea... maybe it will become something as it leaves EA."
76561198023203469,Recommended,411600,31051994,Posted: 9 April,all,SprukAU,"Early Access Review:TL;DR - This game is like FTL.  If you liked FTL, but preferred to explore more this game might scratch that itch.As you take the reign of running the back end systems of a ship, you need to manage crew stations, manage their free time and in some cases manage their needs.  During combat that basically involves a bunch of clicking and praying :)Pros:Unique take on crew managementRandom events, you're not always sure what you're walking intoResearch expansion is a solid progression meterCons:Tutorial is a little light on, and a lot of trial and error (well Trial and Exploding spaceship)Crew tend to be a bit stupid, and will randomly sit in doorways in their free timeFew annoying bugs, but its Early Access"

Its fun i give it that but the A.I are just dumb. They ignore orders and their needs, you tell them to go eat so they don't starve  and they ignore that to go walk around. At least during combat they head to any station that is open or anything that needs fixing.The game speed only has pause, normal, and fast. 2 to short for a space sim. Needs a faster and fastest speed.And the stats, HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's like the sims all over again. Thats how bad it is.combat is easy at the start but can ramp up quick if you stray to far from earth.Random events make save scuming the best type of scuming because you CAN lose a crew member right off the bat when you leave earth and won't be able to replace him or her until you finish reconing the system.Over all it has that old school space rpg feel"
76561197965351399,Not Recommended,411600,21591260,"Posted: 2 March, 2016",all,Crockett,Concept seems like it has quite a bit of potential. However at this time it is very pre-pre-alpha.  I would have suggested that they hold out a bit longer in development before throwing it out to early access.  Unfortunately at this time I cannot reccomend this game because of the amount of bugs.  You will try to save but most likely the save will have some sort of error and you will have to continually start over and over again.  I would try again in a few months.  I do think there is potential for the devs to have a very fun game.  I hope they can make it work because it seems like it could be a winner.
76561197972269258,Not Recommended,411600,35463969,Posted: 3 October,all,Seige911,"Cannot recommend due to the following reasons:1) AI and NPC are not really up to snuff, the guys on your ship rarely ever automatically manage their needs or get their jobs done leading to you having to micro managing them. Even when you micromanage the still can have problems doing the action you directly ordered them to do so.2) Early game is brutal. You will send out a lot of ships before you get one back. Save scrumming is the only way I got one back so I could start investing and improving things to the point where I did not have to save scrum to survive.3) Game appears to be abandoned. As of writing this review game has not recieved an update in 3 months. Normally this would be acceptable, however, the dev has not been seen in the same amount of time. It appears the discussion boards go unmonitored and we have no idea what progress is being made.Game has a really interesting concept and I would love for it to get more love, however, for now I would stay away until the developer shows they are able to be more communicative."

Give it a few more weeks or months for the devs to iron out the kinks.There are bugs and pathfinding issues galore and eventually you'll run out of ways to try and solve them and just give up.But by then you've already sunk a few hours into it and you'll be like ""When can those issues be resolved? I want to play more of this wonderful game!"""

Hoping for more options as far as rooms and objects to form some more strategies, but I haven't gotten very far into it yet.Overall I'm optomistic!"

So basicly it's a lot of ""fun"" combined with a few annoying mechanics. It has great potential and could become quite a nice indie title during the next couple of weeks...well if the devs keep up their work that is.8/10 would support this EA again"
,Not Recommended,411600,21557782,"Posted: 29 February, 2016",all,Larkin,"The game is promising, but right now, I wouldn't recommend it unless you have some faith in the early acess program.The game is hard, but mostly because the balance is awful and needs to be fixed, also, the stats of your crew are reduced way too fast, which means you need to micro most of the time and you cant explore without half the crew doing something useless, and who wont be in your command center on time thanks to the awful layout of the ship (Really, only 1 elevator?).Again, I think most of the problems it has right now can probably be fixed fast, and I hope they do, but until then I will leave this review as negative."
76561197970615726,Recommended,411600,21592805,"Posted: 2 March, 2016",all,SouskeSagura,Very early access at the moment needs alot of work but shows a whole lot of potential cant wait to see what the devs have in store.  although at the moment it definatly needs screen resolution options and the crew ai may need a little work it might just be me but they seem to do their own thing even when they have a work scedule.  But alot to see in game so far
,Not Recommended,411600,33096335,Posted: 1 July,all,considera,"Before V 7.3.3AI is bugged, crew members don't obey schedule and keep wandering through the ship. -> GOT FIXED.V 7.3.3I''ve played some more after the v7.3.3 update and I'll add some other impressions on the game hopping it will improve.1) There is a bug where crew members get stuck on plants if those are placed next to the doors, there is no way around it, only reloading the game to a stage where it didn't occur.2) There is a bug where crew members stay on the doorway facing the player and won't respond to any command, but on shift changes they'll move away.3) There is a bug where at least one of the power armor squad members stays stuck on the door just before entering the power armor, the rest of the squad leaves, doesn't participate in any battle, can be called back, but doesn't come back. So you finish the sector and they'll be lost if you leave.4) combat should really be reworked it's not funny at all. In my opinion the game could shift into a battle screen because the way its been implemented you dont see half of your turrets firing. At least put a shortcut to use shield and weapon booster, finding them on the screen to use them takes too long.5) The ""repair armor"" schedule button is missing.6) Put some collors on the schedule to facilitate management, like red for weapon systems, blue for shields, green for piloting and yellow for command.Good luck with the game. I've played my share and won't be returning to it. I'll leave my review negative so that it catches your eyes."

I'm going to eagerly await the next update! I do wish the crew managed themselves a bit more. Maybe when they're higher level they become more independent.
,Recommended,411600,30842272,Posted: 30 March,all,YEAH_BROTHER!!!,"The Sentient is a very interesting game that requires the skill of time management and organization. The gameplay is quite different from most games but at the same time, it can be considered a bit innovative. Caution: If you are going to purchase this game, beware that it may be buggy, I discovered this within the first 10 minutes of playing it."

,Not Recommended,411600,22383851,"Posted: 12 April, 2016",all,SLUGGER,"I love these types of games but this one needed to stay locked up for a while longer before early access. I can usually overlook dated graphics for gameplay but this one makes it hard. I cannot recommend it as it currently stands. Crew will not do what they are scheduled to do many times. They are starving and walk right up to an empty cafetera, go in, make a commant about how hungry they are, and walk right back out. This needs a lot of cleanup before it should be purchased. I'm going to hold onto it and not ask for a refund right away hoping that the devs will take care of some of the more glaring issues in the very near future."
,Not Recommended,411600,21981451,"Posted: 22 March, 2016",all,BAXTER,"The concept's interesting but the execution is awful. You might think it's a game about managing and piloting a spaceship but instead you will be babysitting each one of the rejects that you are unfortunate enough to end up with as crew.It's horrendously buggy too, from interface screwups to weird behavior and sometimes just straight up getting screwed because your crew will be unable to enter rooms to do things like sleep or use the bathroom.Can't recommend this now, not sure whether it'd be recommendable in future. It's the sims meets FTL, with no attempt to make something new or at least not so reductive."

I do let’s play vids and changing all my settings for one game is not worth it to me. But that is just me.Past that, the game has an interesting storyline. No it is not a FTL clone, but it does take some solid elements from FTL and enhances them. This is not a bad game at all, it just needs to have some technical issues fleshed out a bit."
