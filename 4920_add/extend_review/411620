So in the end, it wasn't what I expected, what I wanted or something I'll ever play again."

The art style reminded me of job simulator and from the trailer, the concenpt was interesting. Unfortunately this is something you play once and probably won't come back to. The platform your on moves up automatically and way too fast to be able to clean both left and right windows while dipping your spongue in the soap bucket and taking care of hitting birds. I wasn't able to admire the height because you go up so quick and your just too busy cleaning windows. You should be able to control the speed of how fast you go up."

You travel upwards and clean windows  as quickly as you can.Missed opportunity for some real vertigo. The platform could have rocked a little.. but nothing.I was really looking forward to this but at the $5 i paid it's not worth it."

So if you are tight on space I would stay away from this one.
,Not Recommended,411620,29349244,Posted: 18 January,all,Boundless,A very short game but with great mechanics and potential  .Similar to job simulator but with only one level and it ends back to titile screen. This could be a great game with additional levels and tasks to do while playing.

,Recommended,411620,25037986,"Posted: 20 August, 2016",all,Trophonix,"Very fun and can be a pretty good excersize too! Sponge and wipe off the windows as you rise. But don't forget to clean your sponge! Oh, and beat those seagulls with your sponge!Some suggestions:- Add high scores and leaderboards- Be more transparent about what the losing state is? From what I've seen it just suddenly ends. Is it a set height of the building or am I failing somehow or what? It tells me the height I reached which leads me to believe that it isn't just a time limit or something. Idk- Maybe make it so we could set down the tools and pick up other stuff or add new gamemodes that use other tools or chemicals, etc."

,Not Recommended,411620,25371605,"Posted: 5 September, 2016",all,Laserob,"It's just not very much fun. It moves too fast and is over before it really starts with really no desire to replay. I know for $5 I can't be expecting much. It also desperately needs an in-game quality setting, it looks really jaggy and low quality. Spot on with the marketing though."

,Recommended,411620,24795498,"Posted: 9 August, 2016",all,f00d,"This game takes window washing to the EXTREME!But leaves a lot to be desired. After just a few minutes, the gameplay starts to turn stale. I hope the developer is planning on incorporating more than just the two items you are stuck with. I'd love to be able to use other objects and control the lever. Overall, I enjoyed the game and hope it keeps on being updated!Full gameplay here.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaE7FjxrHlU"

,Recommended,411620,24788119,"Posted: 8 August, 2016",all,SlurpyDurpy,"This game is actually awesome, I had fun. The price is very fair. The only issue I encountered is I got a bit dizzy when It began moving really fast ( but that's just my personal experience, I don't experioence locomotion in the bestway. After a while I got used to it.) This game doesn't have too much too offer but what it does it does it well. Few more graphic options and extra levels would make this game beyond awesome."

I could not stop laughing about hitting the birds away. :) Quick tip for others playing master the two hand skill wash with one hand on top wipe with other on the bottom!! Best part was on my fifth time playing, The tracking freaked out and sent me flying off the lift scaring me half to death making me fall on my♥♥♥♥♥ :p"

76561197972025376,Recommended,411620,24884031,"Posted: 13 August, 2016",all,justintd,"This isn't much of a game. You wash and squeegie windows and smack birds. I didn't see anything else to do. You can't pick anything up with your hands because a sponge and squeegie are glued to them. The ""level"" didn't last long, and I was left wondering ""that's it?"" Also, the aliasing is pretty bad. It has a lot of straight edges in the distance that look jagged. This should probably be free, unless I'm missing something. For 2.99, it's ok. I don't really recommend this, but the price prevents me from giving it a thumbs down."

The premise is simple but the execution is of a very high standard, with a perfectly matched set of wit and comedy in the voice acting.Performing a task whilst the plaform is whizzing up can be a bit disorientating but it's a cool feeling if you're not prone to motion sickness.Hope to see more from this dev, really nicely done.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTsmQi7a-EM"

,Recommended,411620,24793351,"Posted: 9 August, 2016",all,JustusLeague,Really polished and fun score attack game! Well worth the price of admission for a fun VR game that makes good use of space and scenario.Pros:Great scenarioFun mechanicsVery polishedSuper low priceCons:Only one level/environment (but it is endless or I'm just not good enough to reach the end)
,Recommended,411620,24832565,"Posted: 11 August, 2016",all,csmcc,"You go up in a lift. High. Cleaning windows as you go.Hope it develops more. (Not sure how? But what there is in this is quite nicely done I think)I got it more as a demonstrator for guests trying VR for the vertigo effect. And for that, it is VERY good. Props to the dev too for fixing the play area bug with the lift size. I think the vertigo is even better now you can step slightly off the back. lol.As the other reviews say, there isn't much else to it. But as a couple of quid demonstrator, I don't feel ripped off."
