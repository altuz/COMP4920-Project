,Recommended,411680,19139747,"Posted: 17 November, 2015",all,S°I,"Cute game but unfortunaly i'm just not their target demographic.Loot Hound is a casual scavenger game (emphasize on casual) which revolves around a man who collects seemingly useless trinkets, no 'loot' here.  You start of with Marley, a cute labrador who you take for walks in the park. You guide Marley by tugging on it's leash and let her explore by giving the leash slack. Simple mechanics which only require you to use WASD to move and Shift and Crtl to give slack or tug on the leash. The starting stages are incredibly easy with no obstacles except for a few distractions which don't let Marley focus on digging. You can easily circumvent this by upgrading stats to gain things like better concentration, better digging, better finding, more stamina, and better luck. Each loot hunt only lasts as long as your dog's stamina or until you get caught by the park guards. There is a total of 10 stages, each with their unique challenges and loot to find. By the third stage you will need Wifi, a small chihuahua who has the special ability of fitting into tight spaces to find loot. You will also unlock Mr.Anderson by stage 5 and he will bark at any animal that stands in your way of digging. There are a few secret areas within each level but the overall variety and scenery seems a tad boring with the most interesting moments finding weird trinkets or running from the few guards that roam the perimeter. At this point you maybe wondering why you're going through all the trouble of finding these useless trinkets...well i don't have a good answer for it other than to unlock more stages. When you find a trinket you gain three things: money to upgrade your dogs' stats, gets you closer to unlocking a new stage, and at your apartment you can read a little excerpt that alludes to the main character's background and story while pushing a few silly puns and jokes into the mix. Unfortunately the descriptions don't give you much information and there is no storyline outside of what you read from the trinkets. So what's the point of all this??? I'm not sure yet, i've unlocked 7 out of the 10 stages and all the game has done is made me enamored with the dogs and the cutesy art style. There is not much substance here. It's an interesting concept but it needs to have a bit more depth to keep me interested. The description on steam has a final point that says :""What's landed in the Buxton Wheat Field?"" I'm hoping it's something interesting. Overall i think this game is targeted towards young children and feels more of a tablet game than a pc game. The screen resolution is even limited to 1920x1200 which is a shame since 1440p and higher res displays are becoming more common place but that's just a small thing to nitpick at.Art: 8.5/10Sound:6.5/10Design: 7/10Game play: 6/10Story: 4/10Replay value: 4/10Charm: 9/10Verdict: a passable casual title that leaves something to be desired when it comes to gameplay and story. Casual shouldn't mean watered down story and lackluster game play, you can make things interesting without loosing the appeal of an easy game. I would recommend this for younger audiences and those who just love dogs.I will update this review in case the game becomes interesting."

There is lots of different loot to find and you are still rewarded for finding doubles. You upgrade your dogs skills to overcome different obstacles, for example squirrels will distract your dog, but you can avoid this by upgrading you dogs concentration skill. I really recommend this game for anyone looking for a simple anf fun exploration game."

It's fairly simple, but still has you planing which areas to train a dog in, and encourages you to explore all parts of an area, and to collect every item. The items can be fun and silly. It's a fairly relaxing game, with a neat hook."
,Recommended,411680,26229717,"Posted: 26 October, 2016",all,Frogsocks,In this game you play as a guy who walks dogs. Each dog has different strengths so you'll need to use different dogs to get certain loot. Everytime you find something a British guy says the name of the thing you've dug up. There's no deep reason for all this digging and that's okay. Sometimes you just want to walk dogs in a park and dig up dog biscuits and magic books.

The art is beautiful, it's enjoyable just to look at and the dogs are really charming. I really like the little noises they make when you have them out for walks. The parks are fun and interesting to explore, and the loot items are hillarious. Can't wait to find them all. Really good game to play as you wind down in the evening. Would highly recommend it!"

It is a casual game that's perfect if you want to play something relaxing. Basically you're just walking around with your dog who sniffs out and digs up loot. While doing so you have to watch out for guards or distractions (your dog can't search for loot if he's distracted).Cons:- gets a bit grindy the longer you play it since you find less new loot- in rare occasions the dog stops searching as soon as the exclamation mark appears above its head, for no apparent reason, at the same spot over and over again, can get a bit frustrating when it happensPros:- cute, cartoony graphics- great humor- nice looking maps- every dog has one special ability- very relaxingNeutral:- only three dogs (I would have loved to get more)- you can't rename the dogs"

You don't really need to problem-solve, just pick the right dog and go collect your oddly-named loot. Definitely worth it if you want something that's a bit of fun but not too hard."
,Recommended,411680,19395090,"Posted: 30 November, 2015",all,jerbear,"Great casual game with enough depth that has kept me coming back to find more loot.Things I really enjoyed about the game:-the top down perspective complements the gameplay well.-the levels unlock linearly, however you are forced to revisit previously played areas in order to fully complete them once you level up your dogs.-the scavenger mode for finished levels also adds to the replay value.-the game has great presentation. Sound, humor, dog facial animations, toon-like graphics, you have emotional attachment to your dogs!-I'm not even a dog person, cats rule! however read above comment :)-dry British humorThings I would like to see:-cats-even more dog abilities and obstacles.-it's not always clear why your dog cannot dig something up, which is most likely intentional, but can keep you guessing after visiting an area after 3 or 4 upgrade attempts."

I think that beside of all 3 dogs having their own personalities and abilities, beside of the fact that the owner have a hoarding disorder, the best part of the game is its narrator, Oh goodness, I love that narrator precious voice!"

The only difference is I don't actually have to scoop any poop.  In your face, landlord!When I get the chance I play this game with my 3 year old nephew.  He gets a huge kick out of it.  Maybe that's because he's not allowed to have a dog either.Recommended!"
