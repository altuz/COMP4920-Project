76561198025476310,Recommended,411750,22008701,"Posted: 23 March, 2016",all,Denny,For a $6 game it is worth the money. The levels are fun and the mechanics are interesting. The best part of the game is the multiplayer. Coming up with better designs than your friends is challenging and competitive. It is a type of multiplayer you don't see too often.Pro's:-Cheap-Easy to understand gameplay-Sandbox-Possibility to build complex things-Graphics are simple but still very pleasent to look at-Multiplayer with friends is very funCon's:-Less than 20 singleplayer levels-Somewhat annoying gui and building becomes very tedious as there are no keyboard shortcuts-The game doesn't explain mechanics very well even though there is a tutorial (I had to make multiple google searches for an understanding of basic game mechanics)Conclusion:If you have an extra $6 in your steam wallet and are interested in getting a fun sandbox building game then get it. The game is fun for several hours but becomes a lot more worth if you and a friend both buy it as there are under 20 levels for singleplayer.

The menus are crap, the user experience is crap (no real shortcuts, barely any keyboard bindings so I hope you have a QWERTY) and the graphics really aren't to die for.The idea is good though, I guess it's still fun to play and I just love building / physics games. I'd maybe wait for a few updates before purchasing it, hopefully those will be adressed, but overall it's worth it's price right now."

All the negetive reviews have less than an hour so I wouldn't even think about listening to them.Pros--Decent price-Decent graphics (I really dont care about graphics, heck I think half life one looks good.)-Some fun and challanging single player levels like protecting a crown from getting shot off its stand, making towers that have to survive for 20 seconds without falling, making a bridge for a ball to roll acrossed (sounds boring but it gets crazy), and some other things.-The TNT is pretty cool-You can move the block up and down or left and right if you hold down the left mouse button while placing so its not limited (if it on a flat serface it goes up and down, side of something left and right)-The newest update added more short cuts and a reset button-Theres probably more but I cant rememberCons--Needs trangles for ramps-Multiplayer is empty because no one really plays.-Takes to long to get from the menu to a game, but there might be a reason.Thats all the important stuff I could think of, Also I saw a review that says rockets that point up but they do you just press  R or go into options (people need to look at the interface more). I wasn't to sure about buying this game at first but its worth it to me and I'd say buy the game if you like physics, building and explosives.Update 11/15/2016Game is pretty much dead as of now, the dev hasnt been online in over 140 days.I wont expect any updates for a while if ever but its still good for whats here.Update 3/25/2017The dev has been offline for 271 days of now and I guess you could say the game is completely dead."

One level of tutorial and you are ready to go. the challenges teach you the rest.recomendations? add some things that make me not have to redesigne the entire launcher just because i messed up the angle. tone it down with the brightness of the grass?I cant give you pointers in technical issues as i have a very high end pc, so if there are any issues, my pc just powers through them.Good game, wont be refunding it XD it does need work"

It just came out today, March 23, but it is already one of my fav Steam games!! The only problems are that there are no keyboard shortcuts for blocks & building gets tedious since you can't always place a block on the correct level w/o lining it up lower. If you have $6, GET THIS GAME!!"

,Not Recommended,411750,22316929,"Posted: 9 April, 2016",all,Decky,After wanting this game for a while I'm dissapointed .1) There are no multiplayer lobbies .2) Very few singleplayer levels .3) There should be more content .4) It's really hard to build anything . For example : I'm trying to build a cannon and when I try to build the walls to prevent the bomb from falling off the cannon they are a bit away from the cannon .5) There is no Community Workshop .The game is going in a good way but I think that it's not ready for the full release yet .
,Recommended,411750,25604661,"Posted: 20 September, 2016",all,HUSKKY113,i have only played this game for 15 hours but i can see that is combines complexity with simplicity by giving you simple tools but the ability to build a complex tower or a simple cannon to finish a leveloverall it is a great game for kids and adults alike
,Recommended,411750,22160247,"Posted: 31 March, 2016",all,EPiCGamerBro17,"This game is simply one of the funnest, enjoyable and addicting in its simplicity. Its so fun to log onto the game and build to your hearts conent and hope you dont f up and ruin your creation. Its building mecanics are point and click building and it works well. I like that unlike Minecraft (which i love :) this game has you have physics when playing. So if you F up like i did on probably 20 times so far you can have a catastrophic collapse. Thats the fun of the game. Building something then saving the world and trying to get it to what you want without collapsing. The amazing dev also added some fun special blocks to mess with yourselves and your friends. If you are concerned with the lack of polish / content (which the game really has great content/replay value) dont worry. The game has been out a week and already 2 major updates. One even came out a day after the game. This guy cares about the game and you can tell he will support it. So the question remains would i recommend this game? YES YES YES!!! I would give this game a................. 9/10 Its amazing for what it is but bring it just a step higher dev which i know you will and you will get 10/10"

,Recommended,411750,22015142,"Posted: 23 March, 2016",all,Precipve,"I can only recommend this. It's smooth, with nice graphics and tons of fun. The gameplay is pretty simple, it even includes multiplayer and sandbox mode. Although i hope that there will be more content added soon, workshop would be great too. And it's incredibly cheap, only like 5€. Grab it!"

,Not Recommended,411750,22048638,"Posted: 25 March, 2016",all,Noah Edwards,"Boring, for a game based around building you'd think they have a decent way of building stuff without having to go through loading screens to get inventor mode. Why not just put that in levels. I was trying to build a tower for one of the levels, which had to be 25m tall and stand for 20s. Easy enough. But you can't put blocks where you want them, instead they're in some sort of horrible grid that doesn't fit them together properly."

This is kind of like that, but with explosives!However, the game seems pretty dead, as the dev hasn't been on Steam or making updates since June/July of 2016."

Another one of those quick grab the money and run games, which is to bad because there are some things here that make it rather fun. Save you money, and don't buy.

76561198015526767,Recommended,411750,22078073,"Posted: 26 March, 2016",all,NIN2,Most definitely one of my best buys this year. I mean what is not to like about building your own creation and then blowing it up. Or even better blowing up your buddy’s creation. The interface is not perfect but once you get use to it building is easy and fun. This is a definite buy in my book! Hours of creative game play for really cheap! Developers like this deserves my cash.  So a big thumbs up for this game.
