In Swordbreaker you can do exactly that!This very basic, russian fantasy Visual novel, let´s you as adventurer explore one deadly castle on the search for the ultimate treasure.While the story is not really impressive, you have some different routes you can follow and three kind of choices for the persons you encounter  (cowardly, hero like and aggressive).From over 300 scenes, there are over 100 death scenes, so one can imagine, that death really comes swiftly here.You have three lives per playthrough and the end also is relating to the kind of decisions you have mostly chosen.One playthrough doesn´t take that long, and as to be expected, the scenes repeat themselves after some time, but the graphic is well done, and the music is ok too. This with some (weird) humor, makes up for an enjoyable, if short story.Conclusio: Swordbreaker is a nice VN snack, for fans. What you get is ok for the price it is offered for and fun enough for a few playthroughs. Completionists also have quite some achievements and extra gallery art to unlock. Some kinda crude translations add to the very special charme .. ""you was hero""Point Scale: 6/10"

This game tries to follow a similar platform but with a lot less reading and more art style.There is no combat system so each choice will either lead to one of three lives lost or progression towards the end goal. You don't have an inventory, but certain interactions will benefit you later on, or decide your fate.The first completion should be quite quick. However, there is scope to go back and try different paths for achievements but also the pure enjoyment of failing and succeeding by various means.It doesn't take itself to seriously and the parodies come thick and fast. As the price is fair for what you get. It is worth grabbing for a quick slice of choose your own adventure fun."

It was pretty awesome and was filled with an immense amount of content but you really have to work for it! There are literally hundreds or options, paths and story conclusions you can pursue as your journey unfolds. The graphics and translations are good and nothing prevented me from enjoying this title. It does start in Russian but can be changed easily... so don't stress.I wouldn't really classify this as a visual novel; there is no linear progression in the traditional sense and gameplay makes it difficult to create a fluid experience. I found that each session would last about 15 minutes; I would then make bad decisions, die and have to start from the beginning. This is where I start to get antsy and want to give up on the game in general. In order to advance in the story you will end up playing the first few stages 50+ times in order to pursue different paths in the story. That alone prevents me from loving this title.Worth the $3; a solid game with a hardcore emphasis on choices matter.Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

But the writing is, let's be honest, downright juvenile on the whole. Which would normally be a fairly fatal thing for an interactive novel, if the quality (and sheer quantity) of the illustrations didn't make up for a good deal else.The ""story"" itself also has its moments: at the very least, for every slightly naff idea, there's a half-decent one. So ♥♥♥♥ it, I kind of enjoyed it. There's certainly a huge variety of choices on offer, though the ""three lives, ♥♥♥♥ you, start all over again"" policy is a bit harsh considering how easy it is to die (and we're not always talking ""logic"" here, either...in the finest Fighting Fantasy tradition, trial-and-error is just as likely to get you kilt as it is to reward you generously).When all is said and done, though, you really can't fault the price. For three bucks, you get a whole lot of interactive novel, a bucketload of bad humour, and an absolute slew of lovely images (which you can even choose to view by themselves, both within the game and in a separate gallery; there's a nifty map of all the areas as you explore them, too). The♥♥♥♥♥♥tonne of Achievements are also a wise idea on the behalf of the devs, as they'll no doubt give many a player the motivation to replay the darned thing again and again, trying out every single option on offer just to see what happens (and what nifty pic accompanies said outcome).Bottom line: don't go in expecting too much for your moolah, and chances are you won't be too disappointed.Verdict: 7.5/10."

Game is all about remembering correct ones and can be completed in under 1 hour.  Keep this in mind, because this may disappoint some people who think that every game should look like Mass Effect and cost less than 5$."

Even though there are not many tracks, they fit in pretty well.+ High replay value.+ Dark humor.+ Some hilarious death scenes. There are unexpected ones, but most of them are obvious and easy to avoid if you use common sense and logic.+ It's not expensive.+ Dedicated devs. They are always willing to help (just check the discussions of this game).Neutral:* It's a short game. If you are just going to do a single playthought it won't take you more than 20 minutes, even less if you end up taking shortcuts. For completionists: it took me 4.8 hours to 100% it.Cons:- There are just 3 options: change language (rus/eng), turn on/off the audio or play fullscreen/windowed.- The audio is too high and you must leave the game in order to lower it. It would have been nice to have the option ingame.- You can't save middle scenes and load them later after a bad choice. If you want to change your path you must start from the beginning.I really enjoyed this game, it's cheap and with a lot of content, highly recommend it."

Uninteresting, lacking any sophistication, sexist and sometimes misleading. Includes such things as: Wearing a dress makes you ""a pervert"" and leads to your death; trying to avoid harming an old toothless dog is ""not manly"" (and you have to kick it in the head), one of the three choices you get right at the beginning is ""slap the ghost maid's♥♥♥♥♥quot;, etc.* Most choices aren't informative, and lead to almost random consequences.* Bad translation from Russian.

Mann,"Swordbreaker, developed by DuCats Games Studio, is a unique visual novel with some of the strangest, yet interesting designs I’ve ever seen.The story is fairly simple. You play as a nameless adventurer who goes by the title Swordbreaker. After an evening at the pub, the weary adventurer witnesses a murder. The killer escapes, yet the dying victim hands Swordbreaker an old map before sputtering his last. The map leads to an ancient castle, packed with a limitless supply of treasure! Like most adventurers would, Swordbreaker sets off on a journey that’ll put his skills to the test, and change his life forever.The entirety of the game takes place in this castle, and it’s got to be the most bazare castle ever portrayed in gaming. Just about anything you can think of dwells here; Giant arachnids, aliens, ghosts, orcs, killer squids, warlocks, princesses, zombies, skeletons and so much more. There are over 300 different scenarios to encounter throughout the castle, all of which result in different outcomes. It’s addictive as hell, and each new playthrough will unveil new fights, encounters and choices.But, this game’s true saving grace is the artwork. Every single picture, from the most mundane death to a breath-taking fight sequence, throbs with detail. Creatures look frightening and the castle’s twisted interior will make any adventurer soil themselves. The amount of effort and dedication put into this art is unfathomable.Apart from its random story and breathtaking visuals, it’s hard to believe how much replay value Swordbreaker contains. With hundreds of different encounters and possible ways to die, topped off with over 60 achievements, you’ll be surviving this game’s brutality for quite a few hours. Just playing through once would be a huge disservice to what Swordbreaker achieves.Translation from Russian to English is fine, and it won’t be the most enticing thing you’ll ever read, but it gets the job done. Sadly, it’s Swordbreaker’s pure reliance on luck that irritates me. Almost every decision made can get you killed, and to survive… well, you’ve just gotta hope for the best. You’re normally given two or three different options to make during scenarios, and it’s never clear which one will keep you alive. You’ve got three lives, and once they’re all depleted, you restart from the beginning. It can be pretty aggravating at times, especially when the game cheats you during a climactic boss fight, but with Swordbreaker’s endless amount of replayability, I’d say that makes up for it.It’s cheap, it's innocent, and it’ll make for a fun pastime. I see no reason to miss out on something as cool as Swordbreaker."

If you notice, I didn't play the game very long, and for good reason. The game is really well translated from Russian to English, but the choices didn't really vary. It was either sudden death, which was usually the option I picked, or the other option which ended up being the correct option. No real branching choices. It took me forever to get this game to work on my computer, only for me to be disappointed.The game would be better with more choices for scenarios that didn't just lead to sudden death. I may be just picky though. I'm not upset about how much I spent on this, considering it was on sale for pretty cheap, but I think you should look elsewhere before spending your money on this game."

Intertesting I think to myself, and hey there is a note from a previous student. it reads "" The black tiles are rigged with land mines."" I think to myself damn what a close call I'm glad I read that note. Hey there is another note the first was so helpful I better read this too! (my last thought before I lay dead. A mysterious adventurer in a mysterious castle!Okay for the review... Let me start off by saying usually what I spend ona game is roughly the amount of hours of enjoyment I expect to get outof a game. (there are exceptions of course, but in this case a $3 game,and I got well over 10 hours of enjoyment.) You could easily play throughthis a few times in a couple hours, but I left no stone untouched through my journey(s)in the mysterious tale(s) of Swordbreaker. You are a nameless adventurer traversingthrough a haunted castle in searce of riches, and glory. So now I'll get to the point:Pros for me -1. Plenty of paths to get a good amount of play time for the money spent.2. Perfect for an hour, or two, or if you only have a couple minutes to play.3. Cool comic book like graphics/art I really enjoyed it, and thought it set the theme well.4. Plenty of achievements for the achievement perfectionists out there.5. Cards6. I read in several topics where the dev was always willing to help peoplein need of technical, and gameplay help. (I got some help with my lastcouple scenes from the dev myself) I love to see a smaller dev, so dedicatedto not only thier work, but also thier fan base. I am extremely impressed by howthey stand by this game.Negative -1. The only real thing that's negative imo is occasionally the english translations area little poor. Not so bad where you can't catch where the story is trying to taking you it'sjust a strange way of wording things etc, but by no means does it take from the story.I really can't recommend Swordbreaker enough. The stories are fun, and interesting. A lotof times comical. If you enjoy choose your own adventures, or games that aren't going totake up hours of your time in a sitting then I think you will really enjoy this game. I am reallylooking forward to seeing what Ducat brings to the table in the future."

,Recommended,411760,30280150,Posted: 2 March,all,vreish,"TL;DR: THIS GAME IS BAD, AND YOU SHOULD PROBABLY BUY IT.If the game designers has made Swordbreaker as a movie, I suspect that it might have attained a very minor cult status in the vast pantheon of 80s-inspired shlock fantasy drivel. I don't mean that in the ""hidden-gem"" kind of way, I mean it in the ""get drunk, munch on whatever's left in the back of the fridge, and fall asleep about two-thirds in"" kind of way. It would have been a few tiers below a Krull or a Conan, but not fallen so far down into the muck as to be outright boring. The art screens, at the very least, deserved better than the plot and the design.So, there's a few things you should know going in ...Accept that your choices are nearly arbitrary, and that the most consistant logic to them is the audibly giggling writer screwing over his players. Accept that the story that could only really please a hyperactive six-year old boy who'd taken a testosterone shot to the face, and that it's been brought to you in quasi-adequete fan translation. Accept that you may never learn what, exactly, a Swordbreaker Attack is, or how our manly-man hero learned to perform one, or why it can work so well on creatures without swords or even opposable thumbs. Maybe it's in the all-Russian intro video? I don't want to go check.Accept all that, and note that the game is only three bucks ... unless you want the totally worth is Delux Edition!!! (I'm joking, don't do that.) Buy it, and waste an hour or so getting lost in some really enjoyable absurdity. You'll soon learn to hate the death scene music that always plays half a second before the story text loads."

The artwork is stellar, while accompanied with some pretty good music. If you like these kind of games I highly recommend it (especially for such a low price). But keep in mind that this game is very short, if you just want to reach the end.You play as an adventurer who sets out on a quest for some kind of great treasure in an old castle. The game lets you make choices. Some of these choices count towards one of three ""Paths"": The coward, hero or killer. These will eventually lead to three different endings. The artwork sometimes gives you hints to what you need to do to survive a specific situation. For example, you come into a hallway with corpses on the ground. You get the choice to run through the hallway or to crawl. When you look at the artwork you see a gaps in the wall, suggesting that you need to crawl because the gaps might contain blades that come out when passing through the hallway.The game doesn't have many flaws. One of them is that the intro is narated, but the subtitles don't correspond to the narration. Another is that some paths lead to the same room. Sometimes the dialogue suggest that you came from one of the two paths, while you actually came from the other and thus it doesn't correspond to your current playthrough. This happens for example while doing a task for the cook.These are very minor flaws in a great game. I look forward to what DuCats has in store next. If you are new to this genre, but find hero of kendrickstone to big to be your first game in the genre, this will be right game for you. Or even if you just want something else than a fps or an open world game."

However, when you have experienced all three ends and get used to the way it works, this game become a game for memory and for traversing a huge fixed selection tree by trials and errors, aiming for 100% scenes.You can probably complete all three ends in about one hour which may be exiciting in some extent, and the rest belongs to the achievements time (or boring rubbish time for this game), due to the inconvenient UI (your need to click on the text and scroll down EVERYTIME to see what the choices are, unless you can remember all of them/their numbers) and the inability to save/load (if you made a wrong choice, which of course happens a lot, you will have to start over from the beginning).In summary, this game is a tiny dessert enjoyable for the first runs and its trading cards worth its price when discount. Not recommended for those who is looking for a fantasy visual novel with a good story."

With every passing scene of your journey through it, you will have to make decisions. Sadly, all you can choose is which door to pass, to slay or not to slay character you met, and to attack or dodge an attack.THIS IS ALL THAT GAME HAS TO OFFER.If you are still reading, or considering buying this game, let me warn you. You do not have really choice in dialog other than help/attack character. Moreover, path to story conclusion is short, too short to give you any satisfaction, and every encounter (with exception of dying) leads to it. I was able to end the game in 30 minutes. Finally, repeatability is taking whole joy this game could bring - there are no random encounters.Every scene have nothing random in it, and choosing from starting scene options: (1,1,1,3) will always leave you in the same place.Props to graphic designers though.

It's a little short on substance, being a somewhat short game, but still manages to be engaging. There are a lot of different allies and enemies you can encounter throughout the story, some of which are certainly not what they seem. The best way to play this game is blind, it makes the choices that much more thought provoking and thus more interesting. The story can't really be judged here as the story is literally what you make it."

That said, the different ways you can meet your demise on this game do make you want to keep replaying and making different choices, just so you can see all of the different possible outcomes.Tbf, £2 would probably be far less than what you might pay for a comic with this much artwork, so I don't think you're being  hard done by when buying this game. Although you would expect a game to provide more play time usually, this is a pretty cheap game, and is still worth the money.It is an interesting and enjoyable world that the game is set in. I found it entertaining, and so would recommend this game if you have the spare change burning a hole in your pocket."

The cowards path is saying you will help then ditching the person if you just help the alien guy it still counts as coward path as you meet a sponge guy who wants to be friendly and was a coward in the real world and you live with him in the castle you buy."

LOL The layout is rough and requires far more interaction than a visual novel should. The worst part though is the totally random deaths that happen for even basic decisions. If you want to finish this game expect to either play it over and over and over and memorize the paths or find a walk through.
