If I threw my credit card any faster at the screen it could've been considered a shuriken. I played Estvial Versus on my YouTube channel which you can seehere. So when I saw it was Shinovi Versus I was all over that♥♥♥♥♥♥Shinovi Versus was the prelude to Estival Versus and PS Vita only so obviously this is a PS Vita port. So with that comes the following:Pros:- Plays and runs incredibly. I dare say it even feels way better than Estival Versus on PS4- Your attacks actually feel like they have impact and weight compared to EV- All DLC included (but worked into game as purchasable unlocks with in-game currency)- Its Senran Kagura on steam and doesn’t run like♥♥♥♥♥♥- Keeps the online mode from the originalCons:- Aside from the 60fps the game looks exactly like you would expect an upscaled Vita game to look like- It's not free?Seriously ignoring the flaws with the models and textures this game is all the oppai goodness you expect from Senran Kagura. Hide your kids hide your wife stap in and game on. More plot than most AAA titles right now (regardless of your definition of plot). Girls of every type for every occasion (or make your own in the dressing room). 99 pairs of pantsu to unlock. If your friends don't approve you need better friends, no one needs that negativity in their lives. Great one handed gaming practice. A dressing room with a better selection than your average Victoria's Secret. Super attacks that let you go for the T or A depending on your preference. Katsuragis relationship with oppai is still a better love story than Twilight. It's the game you didn’t know you needed. Bought 4 copies so the devs will consider bringing Estival Versus to steam."

,Recommended,411830,23379125,"Posted: 4 June, 2016",all,LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME DOOOOO,"Review partially based on longterm experience with the original Vita version.Parodical levels of subversive fanservice meets finely-tuned arena hack-and-slash;Senran Kagura: Shinovi Versusis about as niche as it gets. To see it available on Steam surprises me as much as excites.To be honest? I'm biased. As a woman that finds most Japanese animation to be bland at best I... genuinely adore this game. I really, really do. It's not often that video games drift into the realm of exploitation; rarer still if they're done right, and with gameplay competent enough to drive my interest further.And so one of my most cherished Vita exclusives comes to PC. How does it fair on the platform?Decently. This is a no-frills port job; visual settings beyond resolution and window type are non-existent. Playing natively outside of the Vita's 960x544 pixel touchscreen? It's convenient, but at the cost of exposingSenran Kagura'shandheld roots in the most obvious way possible.The framerate is, of course, massively improved via brute force. Between the jiggle physics and sheer amount of action on-screen, this was a demanding little game for the Vita; drops from the 30 FPS lock weren't uncommon. If there's an absolute definite improvement with the jump to PC, this would be at the top of the list.Then there's the inclusion of all DLC as a standard feature; it's a gesture most appreciated, completionist or not. I am, however, saddened by the lack of a digitized soundtrack and artbook, both impressive additions to the physical Vita edition and most certainly missed with this conversion.You know what else I miss? The usage of the Vita's more obtuse features. There was a genuine novelty in 'tearing' your chosen shinobi's clothing off via the touchscreen, or blowing into the mic for a Marilyn Monroe moment while playing dress-up. Most would consider these as mere gimmicks, sure, but for a game likeSenran Kagura, I can't help but feel that some of the charm was lost in the translation.Still, this is a pretty close second if a Vita is simply out of the question, and that's something commendable in its own right."

Battles are fast paced and at some times challenging; the 22 playable characters all manage to feel distinct even though the combo maps only differ a little for the most part; the soundtrack is really, REALLY good!The unfolding stories are distinct and important, filled with character strifes that paint a grim world that extends beyond the spotlight and makes them more relatable, despite their one-dimensional personalites.If you are looking for a fast-paced and slightly mindless game, a game with both easy and rewarding achievements or even just a game with a little bit of teasing nudity, this game may be for you.Pros:Character artistic designs are varied and sexyThe Jiggle factor is extremeThey got lolis if you're into thatFlat-chested, big-chested, tomboys and masochists too!The more serious Pros:Character artistic designs are varied and sexyGameplay somehow manages to be diverse, despite the limitations of the systemThe soundtrack is amasing22 playable characters, associated with 4 shinobi schools and 4 story lines.The stories show that even though these girls aren't ""real shinobi"", they certainly do live in a realistic world of shinobi.The contradicting moral conclusions, that actually make more sense to contradict eachother than to agree.Controller support and GREAT controller gameplay. Sorry ""PC Master Race"" losers, some games actually play better with a controller. Get one.Worth the full price; an even better buy if you can get it on sale.That one time someone****and we all were genuinely shocked.All DLC includedCons:The combo maps aren't any different between characters, a lot of the timeThe character balance is atrociousDaidoji is too butch for me. And too OhPee!Estival Versus isn't available yetThe learnt passive skills are identical between all characters, which kinda annoyed meThere's only a few different maps, so the game gets repetitive faster than other musou gamesAt max character level, the game isn't challenging, even on Hard difficultySome scenes can't be read again without starting a new save, which is a shame because I really liked the story and playing the whole game again to read one scene is a big investmentYou can't play with one hand.Buy it.If you don't enjoy it, come whinge to me before your 2 hour trial period is up and I will take responsibilty for saying that I think the game is good.I won't refund you the time spent on it though, that's Valve's job.Don't whinge to me if you were too busy having fun for more than 2 hours, to remember that you forgot to get your daily dose of whinging about things that you secretly enjoyed.Don't forget to rate down this review.

,Recommended,411830,24577782,"Posted: 28 July, 2016",all,Vallinek,"Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus is a port of a PS Vita musou-style beat 'em up featuring busty ninja girls, clothing damage, and copious amounts of jiggle physics. Despite its obviously explicit nature, it's a very fun and engaging brawler.When it comes to graphics, they received a bit of polish in comparison to the original. The models for all the characters look good, and the costumes are detailed as well. Special effects and location design in general, while not anything special, are pretty good overall. The only thing I would criticize is that, due to the busty nature of the game, almost all girls share a similar body build. (Except for the two flat girls, Mirai and Ryoubi, as well as Daidouji being more muscular overall.)In the sound department, my gosh the music is just awesome. It's either classical instruments, hard rock, an electronic synthesizer, or a combination of any. Each character gets their own theme which does a very good job at describing what kind of personality they have. Some of my favorite pieces include For Master Kurokage, Proof of Strength, Gessen Ninja Room, and Chaos in Bloom that was the main theme of one of the previous Senran Kagura games, Burst.The sound effects themselves for beating stuff up, as well as the screams (or rather moans) of defeated ninja girls are just as satisfying as in most solid beat 'em ups.Gameplay-wise, in single player every mission consists of you progressing through a stage, defeating all enemies across your path, and then facing the boss at the end. It's high-paced action, especially in the duels between you and the final opponents, with a lot of different moves and combos you can perform to be unpredictable. As both of you take damage, your clothes rip, revealing more and more skin for the player to admire, and you can even strip your opponent completely and leave them shamefully trying to cover themselves if you finish them off with a Ninja Art while they're down to their underwear.You can also, from your base form (wearing the school uniform, corresponding to Flash on the Flower of Balance) you can either perform your Shinobi Transformation (which gives your character a specific costume as well as healing them and buffing their stats) corresponding to Yang, or activate Frantic Mode, corresponding to Yin, which strips your character down to their underwear, turning them into a glass cannon with fast, incredibly strong attacks but laughable defense. The latter two forms can also expend Ninja Art Gauge to perform different Ninja Arts which are super moves, including a Desperation Move that is unlocked later in the game, and requires you to be on low health and expend a LOT of your gauge, but is capable of turning the tide of the battle around.By defeating enemies in each form, you level them up, unlocking more special abilities for each one of them, like health regen for Shinobi or extra exp and zeni for Flash. After each mission you're awarded experience and currency (zeni) that you can spend in the in-game shop to unlock costumes, gallery pieces, or play Lingerie Lottery. (This game has some weird stuff indeed...)The game has 22 different playable characters, each with their own unique fighting style, five from each of the five schools, with two bonus characters that were DLC in the original Vita version,Daidouji and Rin.There are two main mission types: Shinobi Battle Records, which is the main storyline, and Shinobi Girl's Heart, which is a special 5-stage makeshift arcade mode that covers a tiny extra story arc for each respective girl. You can also play through the former on Hard Mode, which beefs up the stats of enemies so your maxed out characters can have some worthy opponents. Outside of Hard Mode, the mission are relatively easy so there generally shouldn't be too many problems if you just wanna see some clothes rip and girls talk.Outside of missions, you can browse through your gallery, buy more stuff from the shop, or dress up girls in the Dressing Room. There is an absolutetonof costumes and accessories to choose from, some more lewd than others. (Not even talking about how you can... ekhem... ""interact"" with the girl in various ways.)In multiplayer, the characters are differently balanced to what you have in single-player, and it's all either a 4-man free-for-all or 2v2 with different rules depending on the mode - either stripping as much clothing as possible, collecting panties (yes, panties) falling down from the sky, or just good ol' beating up. You can play online or with friends.The story is a continuation of the previous Senran Kagura games, and while it might appear to be a bit carefree at the beginning, each girl actually has one or two dark details from their past, as well as having different reasons for becoming Shinobis, different moral codes etc. There is also some character development for each heroine, and a lot of them are related to each other in ways you wouldn't even expect. They're fun, interesting, and either cute or... uhm... attractive.Overall I can reccommend this game (almost) guilt-free. It's a fun fast-paced brawler with an interesting storyline and characters, if you don't mind (or outright enjoy, you damn pervert...) all the fanservice within."

Well, before taking the plunge and buying this game, I was really concerned this would be mindless button masher that depended on the gimmick of stripping and bounce physics to be entertaining. Now mind you, the gimmick turns out to be a welcome addition, considering that this game overall is actually fun.There actually is story to this game, and to me it seemed on par with any fair, generic anime you see around.  Is the story weak in small areas? Yeah, but most animes are, so I find it forgivable.Pro's-Over 20 characters (counting the included DLC), each unique with a quirky personality type and combat moveset.-If you find it too easy, there's a hard mode-Dojo mode lets you do online or AI battles, always a nice addition-An unexpectedly long story, played out from different points of view of 4 ninja schools, each with 5 characters.-A ridiculous amount of buyables/unlockables, allowing for some pretty great customization, up to 4 accessory slots per character.-Looking at total missions completed, I'm about 15 hours into the game so far, have been focusing on playing Story Missions, and I'm not even halfway done. So, you absolutely will get your money's worth in terms of gameplay time.-The clothing damage and jiggles certainly could not be anything but a Pro.Con's-The graphics aren't nearly as nice as Estival, a sequel to this game. It's a port of a PS Vita game, though I am told the graphics have been updated to be better than the Vita version.-Some of the story is played out of points of view of characters that tend to prattle on when they narrate. There's going to be a fair amount of narration that you'll probably be skipping and skimming.-With Frenzy mode, it's possible to end some of the NPC battles in an instant due to overwhelming damage. So the longish load times can often make it frusrating.------------------Neat Gameplay Features-In a battle, you have your basic uniform (whichever one you picked), and your basic moveset (aka the Flash moveset). The more you play with your basic uniform on, the more bonuses and techniques you unlock for Flash-During a battle, you have the option to pick between two transformations, both are very strong, grant new skills, and activating either one fills your HP to full (so use it wisely, as you can't undo it once you've used it in a fight). These two modes you can activate are Yang (Basically your ""super hero"" costume) and Yin (Strip down to your undies).------------------------------------------------This next part I've borrowed from the wiki, just to save you some time, and to show that the combat is deeper than it appears.Yang: Yang mode is unlocked by utilizing your Shinobi Transformation and Secret Ninja Arts. Maxing out your Yang affinity gives you access to longer combos, Yang moves, an extra Aerial Rave loop, enhanced damage and invincibility on your dash and auto recovery on your Health gauge and Ninja Art gauge. Making you an even tougher target to take down, you will no longer be stunned from being hit.Yin: Stripping down to your skivvies and going Frantic is what unlocks Yin mode! When Yin mode is fully maxed out, you gain access to a bevy of bonuses, including increased combo length and a longer combo timer, the ability to recover both your Health gauge and Ninja Art gauge by taunting, Yin moves, higher damage, more invincibility frames on your dash and an overall boost in attack power. Additionally, your Limit Break will only consume 5% of your health instead of 10%. However, your defense will take a huge hit, so you better use all that additional offensive power to end the battle decisively!Flash: Staying in your standard uniform is the name of the game for unlocking Flash mode. No need to strip down or perform a Shinobi Transformation—just fight as you are! Fully unlocking Flash mode grants you higher damage and invincibility on your dash, faster building of your Ninja Art gauge, infinite Aerial Raves, increased timing to pull off a parry, an enhanced guard and an impressive 1.5x increase to both your attack and defense. If all of that wasn’t enough, maxed out Flash mode gives you increased experience and zeni."

I didn't go into this game expecting much.  I already knew there was fan service, which is always a plus, but how is the game itself?  The game itself can feel incredibly easy at times but feel totally broken and unbalanced (sometimes not in your favour).  The difficulty isn't hard, even in hard mode.  I find sword user's and hibari are especially easy to combo and chain with and have an unfair advantage towards other chars. as the sword wielders feel way less clunky.  The damage output for some people are outright insane while others dish out rather underwhelming damage.Besides how the combat feels, the character customization is something to behold.

And yet I absolutely freakin' love this fanservice-filled beat-em-up, as my many friends whom I have not shut up about this around can attest to.I was among the many that was turned off by the sexual themes in this, but the thing that isn't really clear until you start actually playing is that it is very much not played straight. It's extremely over-the-top for humor's sake, and if you go into it expecting that, it's an extremely enjoyable experience that goes above and beyond the element most pushed in marketing. (Don't get me wrong, it's still omnipresent; there's just a lot more to it than that.)The story has more mood whiplash than... well, I suppose ""emotional roller coaster"" is the term here, but it's more like ""emotional crazy bus driver going the wrong way on the interstate"". It wildly, violently swings between slice-of-life comedy (the tone it sticks with the most throughout the game), badass life-or-death battles, heartwrenching backstories, and horrific fatalities. The last bit, as well as the most disturbing part of the Senran Kagura titles on 3DS, is kept purely to text and never actually shown onscreen. There's four stories to play through, serving a classic beat-em-up format of ""go here, fight enemies, go here, boss battle"". The boss battles are the real core of the gameplay, as you're fighting other playable characters, and you can also take the game online to battle more if you exhaust these. In the main story modes, as well as the 22 side stories (one per playable character), the boss battles end up being an accidental cakewalk if you simply save all of your powers for one enormous limit break at the end, turning it into a total curbstomp. This doesn't make it without challenge, though. I can safely put it next to Skyrim in the ""I was doing so good and then there were bears"" category.The art design and the soundtrack are fantastic, and the characters are... well, let's just say after a few other series like this, I didn't have much faith in games like these to have the characters be much more than aimless fetish fuel based on tired archetypes. I was extremely wrong in this case. I've come to love pretty much the entire cast, and every single School's story left me with a new favorite character or two. I only actively dislike two of the 22 playable characters, and they're still fun to play as, even. They're well-written, well-designed, and well-translated. The main stories contradicting each other did irk me a bit, but if you know ahead of time that they all go in different directions with the same basic concept, I don't think it'll be as irksome.This is not a perfect port. You can tell they genuinely put in a lot of love and effort, and it shows; you're saving an absolute ton over the Playstation versions just by virtue of having the DLC built-in here, for one! However, I have suffered from some really terrible texture issues in story cutscenes (and only in story cutscenes; the graphics for any bared skin were replaced with random glitched visuals from the Steam overlay, which never occurs in actual gameplay), and two crashes in 24 hours of play total. The levels are short enough that this isn't a big loss of progress (some battles can, with a lucky combination of abilities, take onlyfour seconds), but the looming concern that it may crash before I can save on major battles does provide concern.However, the devs here are absolutely listening. Patch notes have been noted by the fans to be almost directly quoting the Steam forums in addressing exact concerns, and some great improvements have been made. Notably, you can elect to skip, via individual menu options, the transformation sequences, clothing damage cutscenes, and super-move cutscenes. This is not an option in any other version of the game. The frame-rates are mostly smooth, with only occasional slowdown with effects-intensive scenes, especially prominent if the camera is pushed into a corner.In short, I bought this on a lark and ended up very, very impressed. I highly recommend giving it a go at the least, and showing that this kind of effort is extremely appreciated!"

This game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks.The combat that is ostensibly the whole point of the game is shallow, wildly inconsistent, and borderline incoherent. Some characters are laughably overpowered to the point of trivialzing any sense of difficulty (e.g. Imu and her magical stunlocking stick of boobie ninja beatdown) while other characters are profoundly useless until you level them up by repeatedly failing missions. Mercifully, this ""grind"" is quick so you won't sink much time into a character fruitlessly. Mechanics like juggling are temperamental at best, and the ""clothing damage"" cut-away doesn't seem to pause the action sometimes which makes maintaining momentum a crapshoot. Some bosses can be steamrolled in 20 seconds with little strategy or effort, while others seem intermittently able to pull off amazing split second recoveries and infinite combos, which leads to frustrating fights.There's not a lot of content here either, a limited number of enemy types and arenas mean the story is a collection of slightly different permutations of arena and boss.But the ultimate truth behind this is none of that matters. You don't play this game for deep emergent gameplay. You play it for the tiddies and because Ryōna pushes all your degenerate S buttons and you can put a collar on her.Forget I said that. These ninjas are the purest maidens. Except for Katsuragi, who is a habitual molester. And Haruka, who has canonically engaged in forced intercourse. And Ryōbi (no relation to the power tools) who is into some kind of breast inflation thing. Okay, maybe they're all degenerates too.

That's more like the icing on the cake here...Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus is a beat-em-up game that features (at the start of the game) 12 playable characters, and a lot of character customization options (Sadly, can't change weapons). One part of the character customization, is the ability to place your choice of accessory anywhere on your character. This means if you're one of those weird kids who thought about placing cat ears on your character's♥♥♥♥♥ you can do that.Combat is pretty standard. You fight with the same basic combinations, eventually leveling up and obtaining new abilities. There are 3 different ""forms"" to take within battle. You start in your first form, and then you either transform into a special outfit with new attacks, or... rip off your original clothes down to your bra and panties for a different form. Each form gains experience from fighting in it during missions, and once you transform into one of the other two forms, you can not change back until the end of the battle.The characters also have 2 different special attacks that can be used when changed into any of the other forms (not the starting form!) by using some points from the skill bar. Each character has a different set of special attacks.New outfits, accessories, and hairstyles can be bought in the game's store with currency obtained from completing missions or story quests. They even allow you to zoom to see your characters in detail, and you caninapropriately touch thempet them using the right mouse button. DLC items are already available and are not a separate purchase.Within battle, if you apply enough consistent damage to a boss character (essentially any character you can actually play as), articles of clothing can start to tear apart from the opponent. If the player finishes off a boss character with a special move, while the boss character only has their undergarmets left, they can completely lose their bra or panties at the end of the battle. It even sticks around in the following cutscene if the cutscene shows the character models.This game supports online multiplayer! (Developing)...Performance wise, I was running the game on an Intel i7 4790K, 16GB DDR3 Ram, and a GTX 1080. Now despite this being overkill for a game like this, I can say I've had no issue running this game in 1080p borderless windowed mode (However the window stretches to my entire screen resolution of 1440p, so am I running it in 1440p?). Throughout my initial playthrough of the game of 4 hours, I've only experienced a really crazy slowdown mid-gameplay, where my FPS dropped to the low 5s for some strange reason, even caused my own computer to lag. After a system reboot, I have yet to encounter this issue again.Other than that, I did have these 3 minor issues:Character models, when shown in cutscenes seem to randomly shake a bit.Similar to the above issue, this also sometimes happens in combat.The lack of any kind of Anti-Aliasing on the character's shadow is a bit distracting, but does not affect gameplay.I have been waiting for quite a while for this game to come to PC, and now that it has, I'm a happy camper.Now just give us Estial Versus, please XSeed/Marvelous."

This is not the case at all. I run it windowed at 1600X900, and it plays flawlessly. No issues performance-wise.Originally, there were a couple bugs when this game launched. As of December 28th, 2016 (and as of earlier, though I have no recollection of the exact date), all of the bugs I can recognize are fixed. This game still plays flawlessly, and now there's no bugs or glitches one needs to be concerned about before purchase.This game is perfectly solid. The game runs well, it's even more responsive than the Vita version from running at 60FPS, it's gorgeous at higher resolutions, and it comes with all DLC. On top of that, they seem to have rebalanced things so you unlock outfits and such a little differently to compensate. This is an incredible port and a worthwhile investment."

I would suggest this one over the other 2 if you could only pick one.This game has as many santa outfits as a DOA5 DLC, except all the DLC here is included at no additional cost.(there are an insane amount of DLC accessories and costumes to unlock in game)Tamsoft knows how to make satisfying combat systems, usually focusing on half naked ladies (Oneechanbara: Bikini Samurai Squad is their creation for example) Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus benefits from all their expertise with prior ecchi-action games. Even though there is a lot of cheesecake the combat is not compromised and is really well done.Good animations, solid character art and a fun costume customization system are what you can expect from Tamsoft, and this game has all that going for it.There are lots of characters to play as and plenty of costumes, music and artwork to unlock. It uses the Visual Novel technique for story-telling, and the story is stupid of course but still enough to keep you moving with objectives and character motivation. There are three schools, each with thier own story and perspective. On top of that each character has thier own side story you can play though to see a more personal story outside of the overarching theme of the competition.While I don't find any of the characters as interesting as Neptune from HDN, they are some solid choices for Waifu material, in fact I see no lack of options. I think all the character archetypes are present, so something for everyone. Or if you are like me, you pick your favorite based on thier outfit, and there are some cool, silly and sexy designs to be found here.The boob and butt physics here are pretty epicand make watching the transformations and clothing destruction sequences entertaining. Amazing what a bit of anime butt giggle can do for your brain.As I said earlier, this is better than HDN Action Unleashed and Oneechanbara.  While I own several HDN games, and a couple of Oneechanbara games, this is my first Senran gaming experience. So if there was any bias, it should have been for the other titles. However,for a variety of reasons SKSV really is more enjoyable and a better product than the other titles.Compared to HDN Action Unleased, the combat in Senran is more exciting and less repeative. Instead of fighting 200 boring mobs and falling asleep you tend to fight smaller assortments of enemies, often in duels and the fights can end very fast keeping you alert.Compared to Oneechanbara ZII Chaos, Senran has an overall better story presentation and IMHO better character shapes and special attacks. I enjoyed Oneechan, but after I beat it I felt no need to go back and unlock more costumes, skills or anything. Thats because Oneechan is a visual mess when you play it. Senran obviously has a totally different art direction, and leverages the anime styling and presentation to show off their shape, personalities and costumes regularly. This is noticeable in the story scenes and during gameplay.  If your main selling point is smexy action, I want to see it clearly.Also the enemies in Senran are better looking than most of the enemies in Oneechan and HDN.Most of your fights in Senran are against equally hot chicks, that actually have their own special attacks that look cool. This won't sound nice, butit's more fun to beat up on cute anime chicks and watch there clothes break than it is to cut zombies in half."
,Recommended,411830,30446343,Posted: 11 March,all,Doomlord,"[Insert generic unfunny meme #752 in desperate attempt to appear funny so people notice me.]With that out of the way I will say that I first heard of Senran Kagura while browsing /v/ years ago and the art grabbed my attention. When I heard it was coming on PC I figured may as well get it to see if the actual game is any good. I remember it released during my final night shift for the week back in summer and I snuck my laptop at reception so I can download it, because no internet down in the basement where the staff stayed. I tried it out after getting a few hours of sleep as I had the next two days off and I pretty much wasted those two days playing only this, stopping only for a short trip to the kitchen to get some food off the head chef and the occasional bathroom break. Needless to say this game occupied several weeks of my free time back then, so add another 30 or so hours of offline playtime to whatever my current online playtime is. Now on to the actual review.STORYFor a game about ♥♥♥♥♥ ninjas destroying each other's clothes the story was actually surprisingly decent. It's nothing groundbreaking but it had its moments and all the characters had a decent amount of character development.You have three main campaigns to play through with 25 missions each, an extra campaign that you unlock once you finish the first three and a special surprise once you finish it, but I won't spoil it. Aside from that every character also has their own personal side story which consists of five missions per story. Since the PC version comes with all the DLCs included you also get two extra characters which are normally not playable in the main story, so that's another extra ten missions.Overall there's a lot of content to go through, but if you don't care for story you can pretty much skip everything and get to the action.muh grafixThe game originally released on the PS Vita so next gen AAA graphics are out of the question here (not that I expect graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ to be playing this). The PC version runs at native HD resolution so nothing is upscaled. It also runs at native 60FPS so the FPS police can sod off. I'd say it's rather lacking in the Anti-Aliasing department but you can easily fix that with something like NVIDIA inspector (or whatever equivalent AMD has). One thing I noticed, at least on my end, is that vsync is bugged in regular fullscreen mode. Regardless of how I tried to force it on I kept getting screen tearing. This stopped being a problem when I switched to borderless window.The final thing I need to mention is that the system requirements posted on the store page are VASTLY overblown. This game will run just fine even on a toaster (I tested it).MUSIC/SOUNDSThe soundtrack's pretty good, lots of metal, some of classical music and a lot of Japanese influence. The voice acting is also great but it's only in Japanese (I shudder to think what a dub of this would sound like). I'm no music critic, so I won't bother going in-depth here.GAMEPLAYI would say this might get repetitive during extended plays if you aren't a beat 'em up fan, but in short bursts it's an absolute blast. The missions are mainly comprised of annihilating hordes of enemies Dynasty Warriors style and fighting one of the other girls.The combat is not overly complex and it won't take you weeks to master it (unlike something like Devil May Cry), but it's really fun. You have a total of 22 playable characters to choose from and they all have their own unique movesets. Some also sport even more unique gimmicks which apply only to them. Every character also has three different states to choose from: Flash, Yin and Yang.Flash is your default state. Yang is your shinobi transformation which completely heals you, makes you stronger and allows you to use hidden arts. Yin is essentially berserk mode which greatly boosts your own damage but you take a lot more damage as a result.Each state also slightly alters the character's moveset and you unlock more moves naturally as you keep playing and level up.There's a shop where you can buy clothes, accessories and other things with the money you earn from missions and a lingerie lottery to play when you have nothing else to waste your money on. There's naturally a dressing room where you can dress up your characters however you want (and you can do some fun things in there as well).I won't bother talking about clothes destruction, you can figure that out by just looking at the screenshots and I don't really want to spoil everything now.There is also multiplayer which I unfortunately didn't get to experience thanks to no internet at the time and it's currently pretty much dead unless you can get a friend to play with you or want to fight against bots.Controls wise with a controller it works fine. The Vita's touch screen features are sort of emulated via the mouse. I haven't tried the keyboard controls so I can't comment on them.TL;DRIt's pure unadulterated fun, the port is fine and it triggers women and normalcucks alike. What more can I say about it? Wasted over 30 hours playing this in a basement that felt like an oven back in summer. Now I wasted another 30 just unlocking everything and having an absolute blast. Get it, it's great."

The combat felt good, wasn't overcomplicated, but still had a bit of depth to it for those who want to try the game on hard mode.  For example, you've got air raves, dash canceling, a parry system, an emergency escape, and every character has 3 ""modes"".You start in the ""Flash"" mode, and from there you can switch to either ""Yin"", or ""Yang"".Yang restores your lost health and gives you a form change and a different moveset (varies).Yin, does not restore health or change form, but it changes your moveset, lowers your defense, but greatly raises your damage.Now this is all just one huge wall of text, but It's what I thought I needed to write.tl;dr:  The games more than just anime and boobs, and it's pretty fun."

This is the second game of the franchise, and when you consider the hardware differences between the 3DS and the Vita, they definitely had a lot less hardware limitations when they were developing this game. I own it one vita, but never got all of the dlc. The steam version however has all of the DLC and was pleasantly surprised to find them available to purchase in-game in the store. Senran Kagura 2: Deep Crimson on the 3DS doesn't play as well as this one to be honest, but the 3ds games are more of a side-scrolling style beat'em up with weird camera controls. Deep Crimson, although is on the 3ds, has much higher quality character models and environments, and has different models for the weapons, but the tag system in it isn't as much fun as the fast paced aerial-raves in this one.

I've played them all and they're all terrible. Shinovi Versus is no different.With double the girls of the previous in the series (Though technically this is the second of five games, chronologically fourth...), Senran Kagura manages such little variety, and such little combat depth that even the weakest musou games look down on this mess. XXXYBXXXY. Bam, that's the game. Period for all 22 or so girls.Don't worry about the chronology nonsense, the game does a respectable job catching you up. ""But wait,"" you say, ""Nobody plays a titdees game for the plot."" Shut up. Literally half the gametime is plot. VN segments bookend every level with hokey tragedies (And hokey rehashes of tragedies we had LAST game.) pasted on to each girl so you're asked to pretend the girl who literally lusts after other girls boobs in so crass a way as to make Master Roshi blush is somehow a deep and fulfilling character. The only narrative trick on offer is juxtaposing the monstrous and the cutesy. Let me summarize how awful the writing is in this game with a straightforward example: The good girls team's story has them learn the lesson that zealously rooting out and combatting evil is itself evil and you're just a big mean stuck up jerk if you do that. The evil girls story? They kill every one of the good girls one by one. KINDA AT CROSS PURPOSES, HUH.By now, you're asking, why the thumbs up? Well, I'm dumb enough to keep buying and playing these games for one. They are certainly doing something right. For all the crappy content in this game, and there is a lot of rehashed content, something like 80+ missions across 8 or so actual levels using all the different girls, for all the bouncy boobies, all the underwear you're collecting, all that waifu dress up you're doing, all the boring ninjas you either shred through or spam supers through... at some point the sum of all its crappy parts come together as an all-purpose otaku package. The girls are absolutely adorable, and when the game doesn't take itself seriously, it is so ridiculous as to be worth a laugh.  It helps that the port is solid, too.I will never defend Senran Kagura. The series is trash. It fails as a musou, fails as a brawler, fails as a VN, but somewhere at the intersection of all this madcap failure and all these boobies and waifus and shredded clothes and this bombast, it is still fun to muck with in small doses. So yes, it's worth playing even if it is absolute garbage in every individual regard."

This is the main course to Tamsoft games that I was waiting for after Neptunia U, And it was absolutely worth it.The characters are huge! (In that area obviously.) But aside from that, they're also incredibly well written and have great personalities and lots of hilarious quirks to them. A lot of their backstories are interesting too as well, and some of these backstories are pretty shocking too. They're also plentiful, 22 characters in this game. And they all have their own unique strengths and weaknesses. Some have faster dashing, others have heavier attacking, some can harvest a ton of combos (good luck getting 7,777 combos), not one character feels the same in gameplay.The story is divided into three different schools each with five characters to play with. All these schools go through the same story, but made so that they all get to tie in with each other. The story may be simplistic, but thanks to these campaigns, they get bigger and easier to understand. The writing is excellent balancing comedy and drama. In addition, there's a hidden fourth campaign with an extra five more characters that you unlock later on. Plus... there's even a special surprise for clearing all campaigns. The story has a lot to offer.Gameplay is easy to pick up and play, and it plays a lot like Neptunia U mashing Square/Triangle (I use a Dualshock 4 now), except you gain scrolls that let you transform into your Shinobi Form, or Go Frantic (strip down to your lingerie). You can then use the scrolls to unleash special skills that can tear hordes of enemies apart and also the clothes of all bosses. Boss fights make it feel like a fighting game of sorts where the AI, compared to the dumb AI of the hordes, is a lot smarter, especially on Hard mode (which I recommend playing all Story Missions on, Character Missions are fixed at Normal). Again, the main gameplay may be button mashy, but you know you're in it when you want to see the clothes get torn down, lingerie included when you use Specials and Ultimate. Aside from that, there's even a fun online mode with a variety of unique modes, including a free for all brawl, a ninja killing spree (the ones with Dumb AI Of course) and one where you search for panties.This game obviously delivers heavy amounts of ecchi fanservice. Righteous Boobage Producer Kenichiro Takaki has openly admitted his love for boobs, and no doubt it shows. Loads of jiggle physics, cute and sexy lingerie to choose and play around with, the man delievers all the goods to you. Though if you're not the kind of guy who loves big melons, there are two characters that are fla-- *Ryobi transforms* NVM, one of them can transform into a bustier girl like Nepu. Only one remains flat no matter what happens. You can dress them in various clothes and swimsuits, and even play around with their body too! There's so much ecchi goods in it, the only thing you have to worry about is your mother or anyone in your family seeing the game you play. I confess, I keep skipping cutscenes as a result of my worry for my parents seeing.This game is amazing. It may not be for everyone obviously, but this game will forever have a place in my heart. It's an excellent piece of work and I highly recommend playing this game. Even if you haven't played the 3DS Games, this game is kind enough to recap the events that happened making it a good starting point for fans who are interested in this series and that you won't be missing out too often. You will have a good time with this game, and possibly consume a ton of Kleenex boxes."

The game is alright, the combat isnt something that has a lot of depth and it isnt very balanced when going up against the a.i.(you can spam your special moves as much as you want so long as you have the scrolls needed, these attacks are basically a cutscene that plays that leads into an actual attack).This is ultimately a game you buy for the dress up aspect along with loading it up every now and then to play some fun fights out. in terms of content available its mainly just 3 different stories (edit: a fourth one is available for unlock, I just remembered, sorry.) that involve you going through a path filled with ninja girls to reach a playable character that acts as a boss, the other content is just some quick personal stories of every girl and all the dresses and panties you can get to play dress up. multiplayer can be very fun and it comes with bots if its the same as the vita versions. All in all this game is probably 25 hours of content to play through and after that it becomes an occasional beat em up you load up to have some fun. There is level progression in this game as well and some things to be unlocked, so after a while your characters may seem very op on lower difficulties,I really do suggest this game as it\'s one of my favourite beat em ups in the past 5 years.Last note, it runs very well compared to the vita versions where fps drops where common."

But it can also work as one's first Senran Kagura, as it explains all you need to know from the Burst installment.If you are not familiar with the franchise, no, this is not only about buxom ladies ! At the end of the day, the clothes ripping is more a gimmick than the actual heart of the games. Think more along the lines of an action comedy anime with actual combat gameplay, where silly high school girls fool around in a surprisingly cruel ninja world.

There is plenty of quirky fun to be had as well, likely involving their boobs.And now we've come full circle. For a handheld port, it has some pretty nice physics and charater models. The clothing destrcution during combat also gives a nice view of the ""assets."" Though I do wish there was an option to turn off the cutscenes since they do interupt the flow of the battle. The dressing room is where you can customize your waifu. You can also stare at them and make them feel uncomfortable. And jiggle their boobs, and poke their butt.

,Recommended,411830,25225968,"Posted: 29 August, 2016",all,Trash Tier Player,"Senran Kagura: Shinovi Versus is a 3D hack and slash game, where you find a horde of mobs of female ninjas, before fighting a boss. Unlike your typical hack and slash game, in this game, whatever damage done is being experienced by the clothing worn, thus the more damage a ninja takes, the more parts of their clothes fall off. In other words, ripping and tearing fabrics is the name of this game, in a manner of speaking.Basically, like normal hack and slash game, you have your weak attack, strong attack, guard and parry and transformation. Weak attack is fast but its deals little damage, while strong attack hits hard, but are slower. Charging it up will also allow you to break the enemy's guard, in case they are too block happy. Guarding is basically to reduce the damage taken, but it can be broken by guard breaking moves or ninja arts. Parrying, is basically guarding done at the right time. If you block at the right moment an attack lands, it will counter and stun an enemy. Some guards just stun, while some guards will launch them for a juggle. Nevertheless, it will give you a meter of ninja energy.Transformation, boy this is where it gets interesting. You have two forms; one is the ninja transformation, which require a ninja meter to do so. This transformation will change the girl's appearance into another outfit (or for a certain girl, bust size), which some nice camera shots on their bust and hips. The other one, is the Frantic mode, which basically strips your character into their underwear. In this form they take more damage (obviously), but at the cost of improved offense. Both have their pros and cons, and have certain unique traits. In both forms, they can use the ninja super art, which is basically a super move. Depending on which super move used, it can basically inflict enough damage to rip a part of their clothes off. Special mention to the ultimate ninja art though, as it's only available at a certain point in the game and when you are low in HP. If you finish off a person with this move, and they are in their undies, prepare for their undies to be ripped and teared into oblivion.Basically, there are two type of story modes, which are the school one and the character one. The school one is about 24 chapters (except only a certain school have 25), while the character one are only 5 chapters. Each school storyline is supposed to tell what happens in that school and are supposed to be interwoven together. By playing through those story modes, you can level up your character stats, where depending on the transformation mode you stay in (default, ninja transformation, Frantic), it will up your stats for a certain area. For example, if you max out your Flash stats, which is for staying in default outfit mode, you can do an infinite air juggle.This game itself is a massive fanservice. Pervs... ahem, people who like this type of game will really love it. You can dress up the girls with whatever outfits, hairstyles, ninja outfits and lingeries that you want. It's practically a semi-Barbie doll simulator. Plus, there are many type of lingeries, you name it, conventional, G-string, thongs, C-strings, etc, you name it. Also, you can, err, ""play"" with them in the dressing room. Clothes? They are meant to be ripped and teared, if you know what I mean. Combat wise, there are plenty of mobs to kill. Air combos, super moves, parries, it's pretty fun and frantic, especially on hard modes, where mobs start to inflict massive status debuffs and have increased aggro. Story wise, it's quite decent, as there is a total of about 99 chapters for the school, and about 110 chapters in total for the character stories.There is also online mode for this game, where you get to duke it out with other characters. There are 3 modes, which are deathmatch, capture as many panties as possible and strip as much clothing as possible. They either come in individual mode, or team mode. I didn't tried it out much, but oddly, while doing an AI battle for this, it actually lowers my FPS badly for some reason, despite the fact that there are not many mobs on screen.Though, in hard mode, sometimes the leap in aggro is a bit too much. In normal difficulty, they are pretty docile, however in hard mode, they will spam attacks like no tomorrow. Special mention to a certain mob that ONLY blocks in that mode, so you have to continuously guard break them or use the ninja arts just to kill them. If you are in Frantic mode, one slip up will get you killed. Also over time, the game gets practically repetitive. It's basically hack and slash until you meet the boss, and defeat her. Levelling up a character to max level is not so bad, as you can reach max level just from playing in normal difficulty. However, levelling up all the character stats will be a chore. Doing all the character story quests and school story quests in both normal and hard difficulty mode, will most of the time, not max all of your stats in one play through (unless you are Hanzo Academy though, especially that certain chapter which is really useful for grinding), thus you need to replay certain valuable chapters just to max them. If going for all of the character stats, it will be a massive grind and chore. Enemy boss AIs, on hard difficulties, will have additional bonuses, such as a longer period of i-frames, easier to escape juggles, and consistently do air clashes, which makes it quite irritating. Worse offender is easily the DLC final character chapters, where the boss is practically a huge leap from all the other character story chapter. Heck, it's even harder than the final battle itself! The biggest issue this game have, are the input displays. I want to see what my buttons corresponding to A and B is during the info prompts, not see just ""press A/ B"". I don't know which button is A and B when the keyboard binding option doesn't state it!Overall, I would recommend this games to people who like a decent hack and slash, with a huge dose of fanservice. Though I would admit, get it during the sales, as it will be more worth it's price. However, if you are ripping and tearing clothes, make sure your parents or younger siblings are not watching you doing so. Overall verdict: 6.9/10."
,Recommended,411830,28878489,"Posted: 31 December, 2016",all,[ Chao ],"Being a fan of the Dynasty Warriors series and an adult male laking any sort of shame or irony, I've always been somewhat curious to take a look into Senran Kagura. Immediately I was able to get comfortable with the gameplay, though I did have to refer to my control screen for things such as targeting or Shinobi Transformation. The game seems a bit more challenging to me then it's musou brethren, focused more on smaller, slightly stronger enemy packs and character 'boss' battles. Though this difference is only slight, as AI still seems much to be desired and MOST of the mook enemies are rather easy to take down.Graphically the game seems to work fine on my slightly dated computer. It looks good and seems to run a full framerate. The 2D opening looked rather choppy (making me have to skip it) and there was only one graphical hiccup where a character's hair started blinking out of existance in the Dressing Room. I will say though that the game is incredibly loud upon startup, which with all of the Japanese shouting (mostly of the same 3 or 4) one-liners and death cries, can start to get really grating on the ears.At the point of writing this I've only finished the Hanzo campaign, and the story itself was a lot better then I expected it to be, if only because those said expectations were as low as they could be. It was a cohesive whole, mixed with moments character backstory, development and sympathetic moments when it wants to. Then you remember what game this is, and tone immediately falls into unintentionally comical or just plain stupid. Supposedly intense dialogue is ruined because not only is my enemy's fat♥♥♥♥♥♥out in the open while she tries to insult, but the nipples are also sensored by adorable chibi faces. Not to mention, it's hard to take my enemies as a genuine threat during a cutscene, when I just wiped thier sorry asses through the pavement and all I can think is ""girl, just put on damn pants.""Speaking of this game being this game, there are a variety of outfits, accessories and, yes, underwear that you can dress each individual girl in to your hearts content. This is such a prominent feature to the point where the store literally has a ""Lingerie Lottery"", where you gamble money for 'Climatic' (thier word, not mine) underwear. I tried some of the alternate outfits during my playthrough, but honestly found thier base outfits (and those similar to them) to be the best option and the least cringy. If you're into the dressing up thing though, nothing will stop you. To be fair, I did change most of the characters' underwear out, if only to justify the existance of the ""Lingerie Lottery."" All DLC is included for the game, but must also be purchased with in-game currency via the item shop.Overall, the game is exactly what it sells itself as: busty ninja girls beating the♥♥♥♥♥♥(and clothing) out of each other. It's a cocktease in combat, dialogue and content and if you're buying this that's part of the reason why. That being said, it's still a functional and enjoyable game as far as the actual gameplay elements go and has more emotional moments and character development then a game like this honestly deserves. If you like the genre (and♥♥♥♥♥♥ then you're going to be fine with this game, though your milage and tolerance may vary. If you're turned off (HA!) by the perversion but still want a game similar in combat style, the much more expensive Dynasty Warriors might be more up your alley."

I'd normally do so for this game, but then then a woman lifted up her dress, dropped a phalic shaped crew served weapon larger than she is out of her skirt, yelled ""This is my Valkyrie!"" and proceded to blow my blouse off.  After I wiped the WTF look off my face, I decided it was ok to review this game.So what is it?  Well...it's a game about anime girls with big gainax anime boobies beating the clothes off of each other for increasingly obscure reasons related to creating reasons for anime girls with big gainax anime boobies to beat the clothes off of each other...and friendship?First, this sits in the overwhelmingly positive side of steam reviews and the reason for that is...it's an extremely well polished beat-em-up.  Forget about the gainax anime boobies, they were thrown on top of a well polished beat-em-up which combines a character action game, with a fighting game, and Dynasty Warriors.  It blends it together and produces the gameplay style for this game.  It likely also received the critical praise it has because there are few competitors in the beat-em-up genre on PC or Steam and few can match this quality.As far as the gameplay there are about 20 characters each with their own fighting styles  (weapon reach, speed, status effects), move sets, close attacks, ranged attacks, and special attacks.  The characters are functionally unique and require differing playing styles to excel at, something any beat-em-up fan will celebrate.  The controller in the game is familiar to a beat-em-up player - weak attack, strong attack, jump, dash, block, special.  The game doesn't do too good of a job explaining the nuances of the game's system and I had to look up some help while I was doing the tutorial for things like air raids and frenzy mode.Single player includes four story modes for each of the character groups in the game, each character also has a story mode of about five missions, missions can also be played on hard mode with tougher ai enemies or simply replayed, so there is no shortage of content to enjoy.  The flow of a mission is usually a mook wave followed by one or more bosses who may or may not be accompanied with mooks.  There are several different maps with different terrain, the other characters you fight all have their own unique fighting style and the situations will call you to treat the environment differently depending on who you are facing.On top of that is a multiplayer mode (which I haven't delved too deep in) which includes 4 player deathmatch and 2v2 matches online.  Though, the multiplayer has few people on it, you'll likely have to run bot matches or bring friends if you want to play.Next is the environment and story which can be described as all-together wierd.  There is a line between wierd, funny, and obscene and the game manages to skate right on the line without falling down and landing in a broken heap at the bottom of a pile of...dirty panties?  Anyway the game manages to avoid taking itself seriously and it doesn't try to be so silly you can't enjoy the game.  Titilation is carefully managed with either humor or as a means to keep the game from becoming too serious and it manages it all without becoming offensive (beyond being a game about anime girls with big gainax anime boobies beating the clothes off of each other).  It takes real talent to do that.  As far as the WTF moments I've posted above, they will hit you over the course of the game, sometimes when you're actually reading the dialogue or sometimes with you get blasted topless with the phalic HMG and it's hilarious when it does happen.In short, if you are a beat-em-up fan this is a game that belongs in your library."
,Recommended,411830,23378107,"Posted: 4 June, 2016",all,Miporin,"edit: typosedit2: updatesSENRAN KAGURA SHINOVI VERSUS (SKSV) is a good Beat 'em Up game with fan-services for anime lovers. Here's my opinion:DifficultyThe difficulty is leaning toward casual game. There is no huge learning curve to get into. You can enjoy Solo Missions right away. You can button mashing your way through the missions, even on some Hard difficulty one, with the uses of dashing around (provided that you timed your action right), though, those mashing can still easily K.O.ed you during boss fights.However, I am positive that you will be fighting more tactical with all the abilities provided, as you get used to the gameplay. (less button mashing)GameplayThe SKSV is mostly compared to Musou (Warriors) series by many, however, In my opinion, it is not. It is more into the melee side, not just another brawler.You will be focusing on the actions, beating up enemies. The map is small, closed arena with some corridors in some missions.You can block, timed parry, shinobi sprint, dash, air dash, mid-air chase, light atk, heavy atk, charged atk, special atk, form change or even do a move-cancel to gain advantage of certain situations. Dueling is the closest thing I can think of. It is just that missions often come with numbers of lesser enemies to beat up, before the bosses. Not just spamming atk when enemies are in vulnerable states, as in the Warriors series.There are 22 characters for you to control. Some of them share similar functions, however, no 2 characters are performed the same way, so you get total of 22 uniques to play with, which is a plus for me.Characters' CustomizationYes, this feature deserves its own heading. This feature is the cosmetic only, no gameplay change, but for anime lovers, this level of thing is more than welcome.You can change 3 costumes, which is your 3 forms appeared in-game, 1 hairstyle, and 5 items to put on each character. Each item can be move, rotate, and resize, so if you want to put a mask on the hip, you can.Surprisingly, they will wear your custom costumes during dialogues/missions they appeared in too.Example:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=697070878PerformanceThe port has been done nicely, very much acceptable for my standard.It lacks the detailed settings for PC game's standard, but imo, there is no need for it as SKSV is not AAA tittle with AAA visual/fx, where you need to fine tuning the settings for smooth gameplay. Things are not in the super HD quality, but I see improvements over the original.The game runs at 1080p with quite stable 60fps for my mid-tier PC.StoryYou get 4 story routes, 1 for each team. Main plot for each route is interesting enough to keep me wanting to continue along the route. The interaction between characters are refreshing.I am not quite fond of the Hebijo story, tbh.TL;DRSKSV is a good game, and worth my purchase at reasonable price. (one of a few game that I don't refund to wait for more discounts) Fan-services are the plus for me, apart from its casual fun, but can be challenging at times, gameplay. The online modes are interesting, and there is AI available for those too.Here are some gameplay.Menus and Tutorialshttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=695605395Early Gameplayhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=695904644I am looking forward to see Senran Kagura Estival Versus here soon.

76561198138936799,Not Recommended,411830,28106955,"Posted: 30 November, 2016",all,djumbreon,"Senran Kagura is a series known for its ever growing cast of cute characters and its hack & slash gameplay. For those unfamilair with the series and need a reference, think of it as a Dynasty Warriors game on a much smaller scale, with a cast of characters that consist of young female ninja's.The story to the game takes place six months after the second game, Senran Kagura 2: Deep Crimson (SK2:DC). Every character that was included with the vanilla game of SK2:DC is now back, and with the roster that doubles in size, more fan service, and customizable outfits for your characters. You have the choice of choosing between three different school's with five playable characters each to progress on how the following events to SK2:DC take place. With a foruth school of six characters to be unlocked. Hanzo academy, Gessen academy, Heboji academy, and Homura Crimson Squad. The Story varies depending on which academy you pick, and gives you the option to switch between academies in between missions. However they do not all co-exist alongside each other. Each main story consists of five chapters with five missions to play in each. You can either play through as one of your favorite characters the entire way, or rotate between the characters you have for the sake of variety. Along side the main story, each individual character has there own side story of five levels to play through. These stories are seperate from the main plot of the game and are mostly there for achievment sake to give the player more to do. During these side stories, you can only experience them all by playing as each individual character. Completing them simply gives players more achievements, experience points for the characters, and more items to purchase from the in-game store.Cutscene's in the game however are very low in both quantity & quality. Majority of your time in this game will be spent simply reading tons of dialouge and exposition over gameplay. In a variety of two different ways, cutscenes will play out like visual novels that alot of japanese games have. With a background image thats partly faded, then paragraphs of information that a mandatory for understanding the plot to the game. Then there's more anime traditional cutscene's were various character models will appear on screen and interact with each other over their dialouge que's. This form of story telling is fine, however the character models themselves will distract you from the tension. Not because of the fan service or appeal that the game provides, but perhaps the biggest visual glitch in the game occurs, the game doesn't seem to know what outfit the characters are wearing, even if you haven't changed anything, the character models from their navel region; downwards will be patchy in a bizzare mash-up of color's, random pixel's, and piece's of outfits you can just barely recognize, even if said item thats showing up hasn't been unlocked yet. It can even be seen through the bright blue dialouge boxes. There are very few moments in the game when this issue doesn't occur and somehow it doesn't appear in any moments other than the cutscene's themselves. Whats noteworthy is you'll find yourself mashing the A button constantly as most of the dialouge is irrelevant, not contributing to the overall plot. By simply reading every other sentence or two your able to make out whats happening in the story to continue, so there's no need at all to see through and read every individual box of dialouge that makes an appearence.The combat system & level design: After cutscene's, battle's will begin to play, each mission will take you onto a number of different locations, the only difference being which character you fight at the end, and how much ground you'll actually cover. It doesn't matter which story mode, academy, or character you play as, each level will play out the same. You'll begin in a fixed position on the map with a horde of enemies in your path, elminate them all without losing and you can progress further onto the map. Go through about two or three waves of enemies at each stopping point and you'll be given a boss character to fight. Beat said boss character at the end and you win. This is how previous Senran Kagura games have played out.Each character you play as has a health guage that gradually gets longer the more you play as them and level up, and a ninja scroll meter for transformation's, secret ninja art's, and entering ""Frantic mode"". this too, gets longer as you level up with each character and lets you hold more scrolls for longer combo's. The basic gameplay for combat set's you in 3D enviorments to fight the many hordes of enemies with hack and slash gameplay. Leveling up boosts the characters stats and lets you use even more attacks to make your combo's even longer, more effective, and more efficient. On top of that, each charcter has three more meter's that fill up and upgrade depending on how you play. those are: Yin, Yang, and Flash.Yin is applied when a player enter's ""Frantic mode"".  When a character has enough ninja's scroll's at one time, guard, the press their heav attack button, the camera will zoom in on your characters chest. Either press the heavy attack button again or move the character to the left or right and their clothes will fly off of them, down to their undergarments. in this mode your attack increases a ton along with your overall speed. However your defense will be reduced greatly. so use this only if your looking to get the job done quickly. However chances are you won't notice since the frequency in which combo's go, you'll only be hit if you either stand around for too long or just stop attacking.Yang is applied when you use one ninja scroll and transform into your charcters ninja outfit, your attacks and defense are greatly increased. but you become slightly slower. howver you won't even notice becuase you'll be attack the opponents so frequently that you'll rarely be hit.Flash is applied when you choosing neither option and go all out as you see fit in your standard clothes. Unless your struggling for extra health or just want to see the transformation animation again, this is how you'll experience most the game.Once a level is completed you'll be given a grade based on how quickly you completed it, how many times you were hit, how many enemies you killed, and how long of a combo you were able to deal. Alongside some in-game currency and EXP, thats it.How long will each level take you, and how tough is the overall experience? very little. This is the game's BIGGEST PROBLEM. The combat, and level's sound nice on paper, but the way they play out are overlly tedious and repetitive at best. Levels will only get shorter and shorter as you learn the controls and get a few level ups. at the start of the game levels many take anywhere from 6 minutes, and onwards. After learning the controls (and even simple attack spamming) levels will last as little as 15 seconds to close to a minute. (Thats no exaggeration either.) There's no real risk to dying since you level up during the combat itself and rewarded with any you didn't receive outside of battle right at the end. So there's no overall challenge, levels will take you back to the same arena so you'll contstantly be running to where the enemies spawn, use one or two attacks and they'll all die immedeatly. Little to no skill is involved here. This where its said that most of your playtime will be spent on the cutscenes since no level will keep you still long enough to really enjoy. Grinding is easy and simplistic, levels are small and lacking variety, its so brain dead that you'll quit playing to look for something with actual challenge and balancing to it.The fan service and design are where this game stands out, but from the level of overlly reptitive gameplay and bad storytelling (compared to previous games), its just not worth the 30 dollar investment. Play a different SK game if you care that much.5/10"

But as I found myself actually caring about these girls and what they would going through, I found I stumbled upon much, much more.Senran Kagura as a franchise is about the fanservice first. But there are plenty more layers to it and so much to enjoy.If you are looking for a game full of actually strong female protagonists, each with their own dreams and motivations, then you really should give Shinovi Versus a try.The combat may be simple at times and the loading screens last longer than they should, but I honestly haven't had a game this entertaining in a long while.

If you set the game to borderless window, menu elements will be 1440p, but the game is still rendering at 1080. Someone could probably fix that. I don't mind it much though.

The fan service is great and Katsuragi's personal story is hillarious (she sets out to find new girls to grope after the usuals become used to her pervy ways). I played for about 90 minutes in one sitting with a 3rd party Xbox 360 controller on Win 10 64-bit install on a nVidia GTX 960 with no problems. Well, ALMOST no problems. At first the game wouldn't launch. I saw Steam pop up a message box saying that it was launching the game, and then... nothing. Tried again. Nothing. So here's what I did to fix the issue:I right-clicked the game in the game list in my library.I chose ""Browse Local Files""I ran the game executable, titled ""Application"" directly from the install folder.The game told me it was missing ""MSVCR110.dll"". This is part of the Microsoft Visual C++ runtime.I went tohttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679and downloaded the 32-bit runtime ""vcredist_x86.exe"".I installed the runtime.I ran ""Application"" from the install folder again, got ""Failed to start game"".I ran the game from within Steam this time and it started right up.Apparently Steam doesn't include the C++ runtime with the game. Note that I just did a fresh install of Win 10 the other day, so most likely other people will already have this file from something else they installed. Hope this helps."

I'm sure looking at other reviews or trailers of this game you can decide for yourself if this is a game you would enjoy.For those of you who don't know, Senran Kagura: Shinovi Verses was originaly a vita exclusive but now the pc is getting a port! I was really excited for this since I'm a big fan of the senran kagura series and have played both the japanese verson and the english release of the vita games. When the english release was anounced, people were afraid that it would get censored in some way but I can confirm that it's exactly as the original. The only things that are changed are the girls ages (for obvious reasons). Other than that the game is just the same with no pictures altered and the dialogue being as edgy/lewd as it was intended.The PC port is great and would highly suggest this if you don't own a vita. It was obvious at times on the vita when too much was going on or when Hikage would do her 2nd specal the game would chug a bit. Playing it now (and testing out Hikage's 2nd specal) it's as smooth as it can be with no inturuptions! As an added bonus, it seems like they allowed more enemies on screen for you to attack which always feels more satisfying. The only problem I have with the game (and it's a small one) is the intro video. I'm not sure why but it has bad screen tearing and has trouble keeping up with the colors. (it could be a me problem. who knows) but the only thing that matters is the game play and how it runs and feels and it runs great at a steady 60 FPS. The models for every character look great and I kind of look forward to someone ripping them for SFM projects since they are much better than the 3DS models.All in all this is a great port and i'll have fun 100% this game for a 4th time! Something you might not know too is they caried over some cheats from the vita verson. If you want to unlock the Homura Crimson Squad early for story mode or use them immediately for online play then at the school select hold  L + R, then use D-pad: Up, Left, Right, Down, Up, Right, Left, Down, Up, Right, Down, Left, Up, Up, Left, Down, Right, Up.

The gameplay however is tedious and only seems to achieve any level of challenge through locking up your contoller and preventing you from moving entirely. I don't understand the sudden fascination with stun attacks in games, it's a trend I really wish would die. Three simple rules for game design:1. don't interfere with the controller2. don't obfuscate the screen3. don't make my success dependent on an NPCSenran Kagura does very well on 2 &3, but holy crap does it violate number 1. The balance in gameplay is way off, most of the fights are so easy it's ridiculous. When you encounter a challenge it's going to be because your controls are totally gone for the duration of the fight. Hit your counter button all you like it won't matter one single bit.So why am I recommending this game? The reason I'm recommending this game is because it has an absolutely wonderful storyline. Despite the T&A there is an underlying storyline that is just beautiful. And despite having a few moments that are beyond frustrating, they are passable and the other playable parts are entertaining enough to keep you going. I wouldn't call them revolutionary by a longshot. But they are alright, monotonous, very repetitive and overly easy but alright. The combat is the definition of unbalanced and to be honest poorly designed but it is well enough to keep you going through the story and the story is expansive and wonderful. It is expansive and the characters actually grow and learn, and it has some really touching moments. From just a gamplay perspective I'd say to avoid this, but the overall experience was definitely an enjoyable one. So I'm recommending this, but I'm doing so hesitantly."

To call this game a bit sexualized would be like saying Hitler was only a bit of an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. All of the playable characters wear outfits that can be damaged and destroyed by incoming damage and the same applies to bosses as well often meaning a hard battle will leave both fighters in nothing but their underwear. I believe about only a tenth of the space the game takes up on my computer is to do with gameplay and story. The games shop as a mini game where you can wager some of your money from missions to earn random pairs of undergarments, the bras of which seem to be rather useless and jiggle physics are incredibly prevalent and almost every action, even in the visual novel style cutscenes, causes their breasts to bounce and jiggle like there in the middle of an earthquake, It got to the point where I found it all more funny then erotic.In the end I would recommend this game to anyone who likes stylistic combat but felt what was currently on steam didn't have enough soft-core porn and panties."

Well, decent enough, in my opinion.Senran's combat is nice. Controls are responsive and intuitive, Attacks feel visceral and satisfying, and jumping and air dashing have a wonderfully floaty and ethereal feeling that gives the movement and proceeding aerial beat downs a uniquely graceful flavor. The combat immediately impressed me and had me itching for more from the first flash of the blade.What frustrates me to no end about Senran's combat, however, is that while they got the ""engine"" right, they put absolutely no effort into the ""environment"". Beyond the fact that most ""stages"" are just a few linked wide open arenas with waves of enemies to kill (who needs level design?), the games lack of challenge is crippling. After 5+ hours of effortlessly combo murdering hordes of faceless ninja and dumb npc's that never seem to be able to raise a finger in retaliation, I gave up on hoping anything was going to improve and started to feel the WARP/burn out overtaking me.The game attempts to make up for this with a lot of content, many missions (which all boil down to the above), and many characters (who mostly play the same outside of a few gimmicky ones, differentiated solely by slightly faster/slower attack speeds and ranges), but as a longtime hardcore action gamer, this can't replace a well designed campaign.Senran also tends to get a lot of praise for its story from fans, citing that, beyond the fanservice, it actually gives its cast proper development and attempts to make you connect to them emotionally as full fledged characters. However, unlike the numerous breasts in this game, Senran Kagura does not succeed in grabbing me. I can see that there was genuine effort put into creating characters with distinct personalities, motivations, and character arcs, as well as a plot that attempts to run deeper than ""fight the evil"", but for me, numerous little story telling and writing nitpicks add up and prevent me from really connecting to the game's world or characters. If you enjoy flavor of the month shounen anime, you might be impressed by the attempt to translate an 'alright' fighty ninja story into a game that otherwise runs on pure♥♥♥♥♥♥and♥♥♥♥♥ but I'm not.Also, when I effortlessly over-kill a boss on my first try without taking any damage, and the following cutscene tells me my character was severely injured while the boss has barely been scratched and is now gloating about it...I swear, that is the most hilariously immersion breaking thing I've seen in a long time. Oh, and this happens more than 4 times. Damn.So...why is this a positive recommendation? Well, the dashing combos and floaty air combat were just barely interesting and engaging enough to convince me not to ask for a refund. Senran can be fun to pick up once and a while, but you should know what you're getting into: This is no Bayonetta. this is an animu masher for animu fans. Those seeking depth will need to tolerate the games lack of it in order to enjoy its better aspects."

,Not Recommended,411830,33868162,Posted: 28 July,all,Ggdograa,"To sum it all up, button mashing with boobs and panties.Gameplay wise, you're either fighting dozens of trash mobs who take no skill to defeat, or these erratic, cheap AI ""bosses"" all who have the ability to infinitely air juggle you to defeat if you don't know how to break out of it or avoid them. From the very first mission in the game, the AI reacts and behaves the same way, there's no noticeable ramp in difficulty or challenge.The very last boss will play the same as the very first boss does. The only way to defeat these enemies is to cheese them out or exploit them back with undodgeable combos and attacks. Some fights are literally over in seconds, you can spam your powerful attacks and 1 or 2 shot the enemies. I don't see how there's any kind of skill in that. Combos are practically the same for every character too, you mash the attack button a couple times, launch someone in the air and follow it up with an air combo. Rinse and repeat for the dozens of missions throughout the game until you finish the whole thing.The only challenge comes from the aforementioned 1 on 1 boss fights, where you've got no powerups from the get go and have to tap dance around the area avoiding the AI so it doesn't stun lock you and drain your entire health bar off in a cheap series of combos. Most of the time you'll level up mid fight however and be able to take the boss out in a single attack.Outside of all that crap is a bazillion different useless cosmetic items to unlock, none of which are all that good visually.I like T&A in my video games, I don't care if it's anime either, but the gameplay is so lopsided in this one that it makes the whole thing less enjoyable. The positive rating the game has received is easily from the content itself, than the actual core of the gameplay which is sloppy as all hell and completely unrefined."

Not for the obvious♥♥♥♥♥♥are life,♥♥♥♥♥is hometown bits.It actually does well as a dynasty warriors-type game. Without the objectives of defending bases and such. You're mostly beating the clothing off other people. The game itself takes place in a timeline between Senran Kagura 1 and Senran Kagura 2, which are games that are on the Nintendo 3DS. So if this is your first Senran Kagura game, that's realy the only detail you're really missing story-wise.Other than that. It has very miniscule graphical options. Really only adjustments for screen resolution and it's mostly only rendering in 1080p at maximum with 60 FPS. Unless you use GeDoSaTo. However, do keep in mind that it is a Vita port so you're not gonna make the graphics more amazing than cell-shaded anime graphics can be.I will have to say though, currently as is, it runs amazingly. However, the hitbox logic and hit logic in general is definitely tied to the FPS. The game was designed to be ran at 30 FPS. When they put it at 60 FPS, because the hit logic was tied to the frames, players will actually do 2x more hits than usual. Which leads to characters like Yozakura doing one-hit kills on players in PVP with her weakest special attack.Netcode is what it is, it's not amazing or great, but it does its job for PVP.I would say buy it if you're either into anime,♥♥♥♥♥♥and♥♥♥♥♥ stripping clothes off, or general beat 'em up dynasty warriors-styled games."

Everything i have to say is that if you're not its core demographic, better to simply ignore than make social statements against it when there's WAY, WAY, WAY WORSE sexualizing issues. But on the other side of the coin, don't defend it just for the fanservice as if is something sacred.With that put aside to the review itself.This is a franchise which is mostly known for its absurb boob physics and character dressing. However, even if you're not into big anime tiddies or not into (anime) women, the game offers a steady gameplay where the goal is to keep long combos against swarms of enemies and bosses. While the first stages might seem a way too easy game, if you leave the guard down enemies can easily drain your health with their own loops and combos. So pretty much you're in the same position as them. Once in a while bosses and yourself will end stripping clothes, and while is a novelty and probably welcome to fanservice fans, it feels intrusive in the middle of combos or will completely interrupt the game's pacing.Unless you're uncomfortable with breasts zooming on screen and such, there's really not many negatives with this game. Yet, there's a really huge problem with this port as your computer might or might not run it. Some like myself will crash on certain missions or after certain time playing, while others will be unable to play even a second. It really depends of what computer and/or OS you're running, and until the devs releases an assured fix you better prepare to refund the game if something goes wrong. I also had a few framedrops, but is mostly after performing a super and isn't really much of a deal.In resume. If you're into the fanservice genre you will like the game, but if you are looking for a beat'em-up you will also find something in this game. But as said, is an unstable port and you might get few or no experience from the game."

,Recommended,411830,23398598,"Posted: 5 June, 2016",all,Vodoka,"I'm enjoying this. It's really basic beat 'em up game, and it's probably safe to say that most of the budget went into things that are not the gameplay, such as voicing, Nan Yaegashi's funky art/designs and opening animation.You know how Neptunia games are essence of no-budget JRPGs? Senran Kagura is the same thing for beat 'em ups. The stages are recycled harder than in Dragon Age 2, they are very short(though this keeps each mission from overstaying its welcome), there are probably less than 10 types generic mooks to beat, if you fail a mission and want to restart it you'll have to sit through two loading screens before pressing Retry, whenever a boss character appears in the middle of the stage game has to stop to load, non-skippable animations and loading screens regularly break the flow of the game, the port is very bare-bones with only options for resolution(up to 1080p) and window options...But like I said, I'm enjoying this. Unlike Neptunia, the gameplay does have some proper weight, so whole package isn't carried solely by the silly story and cast. And speaking of cast, oh man. This is easily where the meat of the appeal is. Every character has their own play-style, and you'll have chance to experience all of them. Though this also means that you'll be playing with some which you don't definitely enjoy, but there are more hits than misses thankfully.And the characters are all wonderfully over-the-top archetypes. Protagonist brimming with positivity? Masochist who loves being abused and called names? Poor girl spending her days growing bean sprouts because they are best food ever? It also helps that most of them are very positive characters, keeping with the overall happy tone of series.The story does make an attempt for seriousness, but it kind of comes of ham-fisted. This is a series that revels in ridiculousness, but serious moments make you appreciate those all the more.[Edit]I wrote this review before having completed the whole game. Story of one group goes so far against usual tone of the series that it's actually really refreshing. Though with things that happen in it, who knows what it means for canon...[/edit]Customization of character appearances is usually big deal to people, and it doesn't fail here. You have tons of clothing options, accessories you can place whenever you please, hairstyles can be switched... And whatever you, those changes will stay on. So you can dress one group of characters however you like, switch to others and those clothes will stay on.Even if you complete everything as fast as possible and don't shoot for high-grades or replays of missions, you'll be definitely getting your money's worth. The missions are short, but there's lots of them. And story segments between them are short enough so that they don't get in way of action... As said before, other things do that.Senran Kagura is definitely rough, but if you enjoy beat 'em ups and clunkiness like what was common in PS2 era, this is totally safe bet.Oh, and if you want an actual challenge, make sure to play in Hard Mode and to ignore solo-stories until you're done with main story for each group."

I enjoyed this!One serious drawback though, I hated the mouse/keyboard controls. Particularly that the camera movement must be bound to keys, and is not controlled with the mouse.This means that while one hand controls character movement, the other hand would have to either fight... OR adjust the camera-- whereas obviously a controller would simply have dual thumbsticks. Technically a controller has the same endeavor, but I find it indisputably more manageable."

In all seriousness this is a pretty fun game with a decent story and fun characters.This is the 2nd game in the Senran Kagura franchise, being the sequel of the first gameSenran Kagura: Skirting Shadows / Burst. The sequel is set in a sub series or2nd timeline, also yes the franchise has 2 timeliness, why? I don't know lol. You haveTimeline 1, the ""main"" timeline(the first 2 3DS games)andTimeline 2(the first DS game and all the Versus games). Shinovi Versus is set a few months after the first game and is told from 4 different viewpoints that follow 1 of the 4 groups(each group represent their Shinobi School)as the inter-school ""Shinobi Battle Royale"" competition unfolds.The overall game is surprisingly long(being around 30+ hours if you focus on the main story and read the long visual novel cutscenes), and is even longer if you attempt to do everything that the game has to offer. The game is an action Dynasty Warriors inspired game with a cast of 22 characters, while containing visual novel cutscenes with a Shonen storyline with tons of fanservice. The cast of characters is the best part of this game, they're very colorful, have different traits and personalities,big... umm... assests... Yeah the game and the overall franchise is infamous for the huge amount of fanserivce they contain and this game has a lot of it. However despite if being a game with lots of boobs, it does have a decent story and fun characters. It's a little hard to believe that if you just watch random youtube vids of people playing the game or look at the images, or just playing an hour of this game. But if you actually attempt to pay attention to the story when you play it, you'll notice that the long visual novel cutscene contain a lot of character development and characterization for the characters.The game like I've stated before is a Dynasty Warriors inspired game with different missions for you to tackle(the game has over 120+ missions), where you fight random enemies and then a boss at the end. You can tell by playing it for a few minutes that it used be a portable game. Despite that the game is stil a lot of fun to play with the different characters it has to offer. Is it worth a buy? I recommend it only for the people that like anime.Pros:the game has nice anime style visuals.the cast of characters is varied, colorful and fun to play with.the game contains 4 different viewpoints or stories, they contain a good amount of characterization and development for the characters.the music and voice acting is great.this is a superb translation done by XSEED, the only thing they've removed is the characters ages.the game has a good sense of humor.big boobies lol.tons of customization.fun gameplay, each character feels different and are fun to master.Cons:solid pc port, however it doesn't have many graphics options.the shadows look awful.the gameplay can get repetitive.the customization with the accessories could be better.Score: 8.5/10"

I didn't expect to enjoy the combat asmuch as I did.  It actually plays, looks, and sounds great.TL:DR COMPLETE --- Full Review Below ---Graphics:  Didn't get a clock on the FPS, but the game runs pretty well.  Didn't see much issue.The animation is fluid and crisp, and there is an array of character designs with many optionsfor customization at your finger tips.Over all 8/10, could be higher with a little more detail but glad they didn't, game runs great.Sound: The Music is nice, and each area has its own theme.  You can adjust the sliders forMusic, SFX, and Voice to your taste if any one gets on your nerves over time.  But for me,I am a purist, I usually want the in game music and sound fx experience.  But there are slidersfor those that care.  The sound fx seems legit, and nothing coms to mind as standing out,which is usually a good sign.  The voice overs are well done.  For the life of me I wishI knew WTF they were saying.  Sure there is Text on the screen, but you don't have time toread it while you are doing the boss fights usually.  However, it is top notch stuff, just likeany of the Anime's that you can think of that were not English dubbed.   Although I do likethe real voice actors, I am one of those types that do also enjoy some localization, and soI am going to go with:7/10 for Sound, its great, no problems, but would of liked some English, but it doesn't hurt the game.Gameplay:  This is where I was most surprised.  The combat system is RPG like, so you progress with new abilities as you get better.  And you do get XP when you lose too, just not very much. But this can help you not lose hope on a tough boss when you are just trying to figure out the game. This game is heavy on trying to keep the combo meter on the rise, so you really have to have spatial awareness and this can be hard in a game with camera controls like this.  However, this is a lockon system that will help you out if you find yourself having trouble.  Each character has their own fighting style that varies in look and feel.  And there is the Shinobi Transformation system that is reallypretty much the icing on the cake for this game.  It's all fan service, but it actually has a reason to exist in the game.  You see, somehow your clothes make you stronger, so as you fight, you might have them get shreaded a bit and you get weaker.  So this is where the Shinobi Transformation comes into play, as you get a fresh new outfit that also makes you stronger than your default self.  And on top of that, after you transform you can do Secret Ninja Art attacks that can turn the tide of battle pretty fast.  And each character gets 2 different types of these.  And there is a block system, and a counter system, which if timed right helps recharge your transformations.  There is tons of ariel / warp to enemy finish attacks to enjoy.  And if all else fails, you can do this one move to rip your own clothes to rampage a bit and gain attack while losing defense, so that is something else you can do if you like.  As far the RPG elements, it seems there are 3 branches and you get gains in them by doing skills that are in that branch.  So it follows on of my fav. RPG gain systems, which is use a skill and you gain skill in that skill, it just makes more sense than level up and spend points at will to me.  So:I give it a 8/10 on gameplay, as it seems to have some replay value, and there is PvP Online if you want to do that.Going to wrap it up now, don't have much more to say, so final conclusion is:8/10 -  Good Game.  Get if/when you can.  You don't have to wait for a sale, its good.  But if its too high, which it is a bit, wait.  But I heard since it comes with all the DLC, on the other system it was like $120 bucks with everything, so in a way this is a deal.  Enjoy!"

I'm serious, it is.Senran Kagura is a franchise I was admittedly interested in for jiggle physics and attractive character design. My first game was Estival for the PS4 and after that the whole series wormed its way into my heart. One reviewer described this game as “surprisingly endearing”, which is what I'd summarize it as too. It's eyecandy and isn't going to lie about being eyecandy. There's exploding clothes, large breasts, and more all over the place. It's about waifus being ninjas, bonding, fighting, wanting to burn down a school because an old man groped them... Yeah.It's ridiculous and the writing is honestly cringeworthy. It has good points, but the selling factor are the characters, their designs, and gameplay. Gameplay is fun, if not repetitively so. You rarely have to change up what you do overall and the harder difficulty is basically everything does a buttload of damage and you get hitstunned. Graphics were alright and there's a dressup room but it's frustratingly limited compared to Estival Versus.Music is top notch and you'll find yourself picking out a waifu or two (even if you adamantly refuse not to). Characters seem bland but they're not so much that you're not rooting for them or hate something minor about them. My favorite is Yumi and while I hate how she was written in Hanzo's story, Yumi herself is sweet and charming, she's strong and soft without hiding either one, and devoted to boot. Katsuragi is a boobmonster and gropes and slobbers over everyone while being a friendly sempai with an appropriate seiyuu that can work from manly to creepy. Fighting styles are nice too, as no one character feels like any other in Senran Kagura. Mirai uses a umbrella gun, Murasaki has spooky dark powers, both Ikaruga and Miyabi both wield one sword but both of them as vastly different in terms of what they do.Then you have people like Daidoji and Rin who can, to quote the game about Daidoji: “systematically obliterate” anything. Daidoji is just an incredible bamf and Rin's techniques are really cool to watch.It will get boring. Beat 'em ups styled like Dynasty Warriors just do. It's still worth its purchase for 30 dollars with ALL the DLC packaged in. Again, it's eyecandy and it doesn't try to deny it is. But it's still fun enough to not just be a fapfest.I REALLY recommend Estival Versus on the PS4/Vita if you can grab it if you liked this one or just looked into Shinovi. It has improvements in every aspect and in general is just a great game. This is still good too, just less so than its successor."

Shinovi then slithered its way into the steam store, and being one of those people that had and throughly enjoyed the 3DS games, I found myself shortly after clicking ""purchase for myself"". I played the game in its entirety and am sealing the deal with this review1. GameplayThe game is a solid beat'em up with visual novel elements inbetween levels. There are four different campaigns to play equiped with a five level personal adventure for each of the characters.-Though skippable the clothing destruction does disrupt the gameplay and can get annoying (something made to fit more smoothly into the gamplay in further installments.)-The enviroments you fight in are varied from mountain trecks, the city to inside the individual schools-The styles of combat can differ greatly from girl to girl, though all are fun in their own little ways.-The gameplay is exceptionaly smooth due to the frame capability of this version.-I found the tageting to be very useful as it auto locks onto the nearest enemy when your target is incapacitated.-Executing combos properly can sometimes be challanging as you must wait for the animations to start before it registers consecutive button presses.-The Ultimate arts are a very nice addition to the game as the rest of the arts are very spammable, and get old quickly.-Sometimes characters talk to each other during fights which leads the non-japanese flluent players to hault the fight until all the subtitles are read.-I highly recommend playing on hard mode as many-a-time character's reactions to the fight don't match the feeling I had about the fight. Ex) -Asuka ""Boy was that a tough fight"" -Me ""Asuka, you are a ♥♥♥♥ing liar""-I highly recommend using a controller to play.2. Characters (Hikage is Best Girl)The character designs for all the new ninjas are very nice with some much more cute, graceful or badass than others There is really something for everyone. They shine brillianty from their interations with one another. They are not one-dimensional as there is a good amount of decent character development. The vast majority of characters are not stagnant or flat. Most of them are going to change as you play campaigns or side stories, but some have changed since the burst installment. As should be, the Rin and Daidouji side stories feature the two hardest fights in the game by far. (Something I'm very happy about)3. Visual Novel SegmentsThe fact that all dialogue is voice acted is very nice, and the art used for characters is clean, in high resolution, and very pretty. If memory serves correctly I noticed maybe  two grammar mistakes while playing. I must applaud the localization team for their efforts to make the diologue at times hilarious. And without the use of pop culture, which I think is a plus. As great as this translation is, I at times hear words spoken but the words I'm reading couldn't possibly has been derived from the audio, which leads to slight discomfort.4. SoundThe game features a very solid soundtrack, something has been very consistent with the franchise. As usual all characters receive a different realization of their theme(s) from other titles in the franchise. Most I find are nicely tied with the personas that the characters give off. The tracks simulate various emotions that tactfully improve the overall experience. As to be expected there are a good amount of tracks that will get you especially hyped during fights. Some songs are sung by some of the characters which is pretty cool if you ask me.5. Presentation of StoryThe four campaigns were surprisingly very different in both story and format in which the stories unfold. This game much of the time does not take itself too seriosly leading to a lot of playful humor, but when the game wants to it can definately turn for the more serious and ask questions that provoke deep thought. This game may be set in a different universe than the 3ds games, but they all work to expand upon each other in giving the player more and more answers to questions formulated while playing other games. I'm not sure if this was on purpose, but I think its a very neat idea.6. The Life and HometownWhile the Life is much more prominent the Hometown isn't non-existent. Some characters are noticebly more endowed than others in each regard (Yomi and others being champions of both), so there is a pretty good variety.7. CustomizationI don't have much to say. All the dlc is included. Some costumes are pretty rad. Some costumes are make you look around for lube. They are pretty neat but I find that the default costumes are better than the external ones bought from the in-game store, so I almost never changed them.This series of games is near and dear to my heart, so I hope if you weren't convinced before you are now.Buy the Game. It is worth your money and timeAlso make sure to thank Kenichiro Takaki for this most holy of franchises."

Animations and the 3 special attack for all the characters are pretty good making the battles pretty enjoyable. Gamepad is highly recommended.Only bad I can say about the game, is that its pretty much a straight copy of the vita version. Also I had serious frame rate drop in the game while it was set to fullscreen with 1920x1080 resolution with a beastly machine. Once I toned it down a bit and set it to windowed it ran smoothly.

Controls are fine and have to say fine cause aerial brake ....is something desing for control sticks...dont know..and dont want think how can you win using mouse and keyboard. Ost is fine ...have good music and some battles have great ost. camera ....have problems but almost all time you will not feel them. Had a lot of dress and with 22 chars you will enjoy it (thanks free dlc), almost no bugs...only got one in last fight againsht homura...where you was stuck in an attack and i couldnt do anything have to go cancel ) have good dps of 60. Well pvp is actually good so if none get bored you can enjoy game more after finish story.Now the bad parts with 22 chars you could feel ok i want use this now...but sadly devolopers make a huge mistake... lets say i want change look of homura...well go to crimsom squad and do it...after it...you think ...ok i think this could look great with asuka...well then get out change school and do it......for edit chars you must be in correct school...i expected after finish story that i hadn't to do it...but was wrong edits chars need you change to correct schools. As i wrote before chars have design problem, and you will feel it is not like you have to learn to use its more that one is overpowered and the other is just trash. Example daidoji vs rin...is a clear adventage for rin a lot...you can do both story have same last battles and you can win with rin in first try without much worry but with daidoji will take much time and effort...and will dont be easy. The reason are first daidoji is slow and depend in hit hard.  So fast char had huge adventage here. The clothes destroy escene go against you always...that means after you get clear the clothes you will feel safe doing full combos ...before it you will fail a lot.Even after all that i suggest this game ...and between neptunia U i prefere this cause have multiplayer and more hard combat."

What you basically got here is a basically a Dynasty Warriors style game mixed with Dead or Alive-tier girls, it's a basic button masher where you fight through loads of enemies and occasionally clothes get ripped off. It's goofy, it's very Japanese, and it plays good, especially with a controller, and though the PC port is barebones as far as customization options go (some anti aliasing would be nice) it runs pretty well.If I had to find some complaints with the game, despite the large roster of playable characters the game can get repetitive because you're mainly fighting in the same environments against the same characters over and over again. Though there are 4 story modes the plot isn't that interesting compared with it's sequel Deep Crimson on 3DS and you'll forget about it eventually. And the transformation/clothes ripping scenes get annoying when you do side stories as they cause the dialogue to repeat again and again.But in spite of those faults, I'd recommend the game, provided you like beat em ups and can look past the artstyle, as there's a ton of content, and because it's a port of a handheld game, you can easily pick it up and play it whenever you want due to the fast missions. If you're still on the fence, I'd recommend picking it up for $20."

In this game, you take control of a large cast of hot babes (except Mirai, but don't bully her), and do Dynasty Warriors. Taking inspiration from another game similar to Dynasty Warriors, Drakengard, the entire cast has been made to be batshit insane, ranging from Minori - a stupid dumb idiot to a weirdo who can't take off her mask all the way to the eyebrow girl from Kill La Kek. Another similarity to Drakengard is that this game is very plot centric, each and every girl has a huge amount of plot (except Mirai, so be nice to her).

This game have your standard light attack, heavy attack, guard, dash, etc. Where this game differ is how you can activate your ninja transformation. Transforming into your ninja outfit refills your health and make your attacks more devastating. Also another big feature is how outfits will tear away as your lose health until they are left with nothing but there undies on and sometime even less. But don't worry, they got censors (damn it...)Honestly the gameplay is can get repetitive especially if you don't like beat em up. But where the replay ability and life of this game is the collectible outfits and items. You can buy outfits and change your characters into a huge amount of items and outfits. You can change them from hair style and outfit, down to what type of underwear they wear. It seriously add to the life of this game.Honestly this is a fun perverted game and it knows it.

Its a beat em up where you play as one of several female shinobi. These shinobi belong to different schools. You have the familiar Hanzo and Hejibo academy as well as a new school in the form of Gessen.Each ninja plays differently with their own unique abilities. The game is broken up into chapters with a mission based structure. These are often interspersed with text sequences that tell more of the narrative. Your goal is often to deal enough damage to the enemy ninjas to 'strip' them of their clothes. Yes the game's fan service is as bountiful as the busts of the the characters. But beneath that fanservice is a fun beat em up game.There are unlockables in the form of new bits of clothing ranging from lingerie to maid outfits, etc. As you play your characters gain experience and level up and unlock new abilities as well.A lot of japanese ports on steam have been of questionable quality. This is one of the good ones. It runs at a solid 60 fps and for the price you will find its a better value than something like DOA V which still has issues and over priced DLC."

The game does have some flaws though. For one thing, there is never anyone online, dispite this being a really fun feature. Shinovi Versus can be very repetative in it's missions, typically in the form of kill a ton of weak enemies then fight a character at the end. The game does try to mix things up by making the levels big and having the player travel through it for a while fighting a couple waves in each area, but they all become samey after a while. The in game store is kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥ there are tons of cool outfits, but you unlock them very infrequently but in mass ammounts. After each chapter the game dumps a handful of new items for you to buy, but with each chapter taking around half anhour to an hour each, getting that perfect look takes a long time.The game does have a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of really cool things in it that counter it's flaws. To start, Shinovi Versus has really good graphics, they stand out in just how well done they are. you can play through a handful of missions as each character outside of the mian story to level them up and make beating the story mode a lot easier, this takes time, but is well worth it if you want to play every mission on hard mode. As with a lot of Anime games, the soundtrack is amazing. Shinovi Versus intro/menu theme is really good. You do have to use in-game money to buy the songs, a minor drawback,  but after pplayeing a ton of chapters, this isn't really tthat bad. The story itself is pretty good, it's a little slow and can be confusing if you play as a different school half way through another's story. After beating the game, (Or through cheats) you can unlock Homura's Crimson Squad as a playable School. It'll take a while to get that far, but it's a nice reward if you stick with it that long.Overall, Shinovi Versus is a pretty good game. When compared to other Anime games, it certaintly is one of the best, as Senran Kagura games have always been. It's a title well worth getting at full price, and a staple for any Otaku's collection....What? You want to know my opinion of the fanservice? Is that why you read this far? *Sighs* Fine.

76561198058156743,Recommended,411830,23458528,"Posted: 8 June, 2016",all,Inspector Dosh,"This is another port I was not expecting to come on PC, but I ain't complaining, at least not too much. While the port is not perfect, at least it's better than some other Japanese developed PC ports like Phantom Breaker: Battlegrounds, Akiba's Trip, and most ports from Koei Tecmo. For the most part, it is recommended to play with a gamepad, but you can use the keyboard just fine, but you have to go into the setting to look up the binds and change them accordingly to what feels comfortable to you since the default bindings are not that good. Like most ports, they still give you button prompts for a gamepad hence gives you another reason to look up the key bindings in the settings menu. Also mouse support in the menus. THE MENUS!!! WHERE ALMOST EVERY SINGLE PORT FROM JAPAN DOES NOT GIVE YOU ON PC!!!!!I gotta say, the brawling feels immensely satisfying with the fast-paced animations and flashy effects, but initially when a character is at level 1, they don't feel that interesting to play, but it is easy to get out of that. Speaking of easy, aside from unexpected stun locks, the overall difficulty is pretty easy despite the existance of a harder difficulty setting so fighting the minions get pretty boring afterwards so the only saving grace for me are the character duels(expect to see a huge difficulty spike on Daidoji's final mission in her story arc while Rin's last story mission is not as hard, but still can destroy you).Despite it being a bit of a mess, an online multiplayer mode actually exist. I didn't really touch the multiplayer all that much, but what I found was that my keyboard controls were completely botched and the framerate was noticably worse when playing with 3 other bots for some reason. As for the overall power of the characters, they seemed to be toned down to a degree to keep certain characters from being straight up better than others, more specifically ones that have elemental stunning abilities like freezing and electrocution. Because the power level has to be toned down, it also sacrifices the satisfaction of watching flashy combos so most of the excitement from those ridiculous combos are just nowhere to be found, at least that's what I thought.As for the economy system, you can pretty much buy clothing for anybody of your choosing just because you can. No stat boosting, no side effects, just purely cosmetic for your virtual waifu. And yes there is a slot machine section where you unbox undergarments because reasons, but hey, it's there if you need to unbox stuff without spending $2.49 for some stupid CS GO skins or something.Is there a story? Sort of, but it's really nothing to write home about so I ended up skipping the dialogue since it really is just typical anime so you ought to just take it or leave it as is. Music is great though, I'm always a sucker for music.Is this worth your $30? If you like watching busty anime high school girls fight with each other along with some pretty simple, but satisfying combat mechanics, then Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus is the game for you. However, if you're looking for a game that provides a more challenging experience, why did you stop playing Dark Souls just to look at this?"

I always wanted to play a game like this , thats doesnt make me go rage or getting frustating and stuck at one mission forever,because its to hard or so.The mission on ""normal"" are really easy and interesting.Of course there are mostly peoples , that search for challenge and this game offer you ""challenges"" aswell , if you go for hardmode for example , then its a bit more harder ...This game is really nice for round about 25 different stories ( 4 ""main"" stories and rest some unique Character Stories).Some of them are really fun , Some are sad , some are weird and some are really enjoyable and encourage you to play it.Honestly ? I never got bored , even , if i fought the same characters from each shool at one main story,because the background is totally different or you learn more background stuff about all those characters or understand stuff now more than before.Of course ! All chats between those characters or stories end up in fights , which is kinda funny sometimes or kinda weird, but we shouldn't forget its a fight game!Hell yeah! Its a great one!How about combat ? The combat buttons are kinda same way like pressing 1-2 buttons for attacks , which can end up in a few combos, but they all feel different , because each character plays different for example some characters are better to be played with weak attacks ,while other requires more strong/slow attacks.Also each character got a shinobi mode , a normal mode and a frantic mode ,which give each character THREE differents ways to fight and to play, because frantic makes you more vurnerable but also more stronger ,while shinobi makes you more tankier and heals your health.So you got like 60+ different fight styles,which is pretty nice tbh.Of course you can block or dodge attacks ,which offers you some options to defend ,which some games lacks or makes blocking or dodging useless , but this game do it right and brilliant in my opinion ! 2 defend options are nice !Also this game got a leveling system ,which keeps you busy after you completed the entire story and once its completed you can play each story stage with different characters of each shool ( Main story only and only with characters from that shool).You can improve your shinobi state or frantic or your normal state and also your health/dmg/def,which kinda makes you able to create your own fighting style or well play style.And yes ! You can shatter clothes and lingerie until there is nothing left on their bodies.It does looks nice (!), but on some intense fights for myself . i wish i could turn it off ,because even , if i press a key to skip it .it kinda interrupts me in combat and makes it less smoothly or sometimes i press all those buttons too fast , that i accidently skip it.The Physics is nice and the customisation of your characters is great , even , if some shinobi outfits looks soooooo much better than some ""normal"" outfits ,which makes it kinda difficult to find a good outfit+ with more money you can unlock more slots for accessoirs or more outfits.Also the enviroment got some variantions not a lot , but you notice that there are like six maps ,which are a bit repetive , but the enemies changes or the way you go sometimes change, but honestly ? I dont care this game grants me some nice visuals fighting and shattering effects on clothes , have a funny/sad/weird/intense story,Characters with background+ different playstyle and fightstyle, simple combat lines ,a leveling system and of course a multiplayer mode ,which i haven`t tried yet+ ONE FINAL BATTLE mode which is one of the three toughest fight i ever had in this game and all DLCS ARE FOR FREEE !!!!I LOVE THIS GAME !

The game itself has some nice eye candy aswell as easy to learn controls if you just looking to kill some time before you leave or if you\'re a new comer whom has never played a SK game before. Seeing as the is a Beat\'em up game the gameplay does at times get repeative, and the lack of other single player modes kinda kills the single player aspect after you level up all the Girls, but then you can take the battle to MP where you can battle real players or fight agianst computer players.Overall this is a game that I really, really, really enjoy enough to for to even buy the game twice, but three times.A bit on the negative side, the load times are kinda slow, and the framerate in full screen is kinda weird, but when in windowed it is just fine. It might just be a problem with my GPU or something, but those are the only cons I can really think of.Happy Boobs/10"

The feminist door isthat-a-way.Once again, it's another game that I've seen and enjoyed. Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus is definitely a great game to play, if you have a good enough computer. With my own computer, however, I was able to keep the 60 FPS cap at all times. The graphics aren't customizeable, meaning that you'd have to stay at whatever framerate you have. Or maybe you need to reduce the resolution. I haven't tested it myself.Besides being a big mountain of fanservice, the game is basically a big ""beat em' up"", one of my now favorite genres of games. I enjoyed the mechanics of the game - it made it challenging but at the same time relaxing, knowing how to perfect combos and such. Guarding is one thing I haven't usedat allthough, so it's still frustrating to get comboed myself. The game also revolves around the ""Shinobi Tenshin"", which basically transforms your character into a different suit, with different buffs. (And all the more fanservice, too!)The game is also very customizeable - both in accessories, controls, and many, many outfits. In my runthrough of the Hanzo Academy, the shop allows you to buy clothing and lingerie from the shop, along with many songs, pictures, and a few other characters. There's also something called the ""Lingerie Lotto"", where you donate a certain amount of money to reach a quality of pantsu. (I've gotten one ""Climactic!"" before, and I wasn't NOT amused.)TL;DR:The game revolves around oversexualized women. (or lolis, if you're into that)Running it will take a ""more than decent"" computer, but it should still be fun.The game's a breathtaking beat em' up that keeps you at bay.ALL OF THE FANSERVICE.Overall, I enjoy the quality of this game. Besides the very obvious sexualization, it's still a fun game to play just for fun. There is a possible multiplayer mode, but I haven't tested that out myself yet. More will come later. Maybe if I care. It's definitely worth the money ($26.99 on sale) if you can run it, and it'd be best if you can get it ASAP.Who's your favorite girl from the Senran Kagura series? List down below.

Nothing groundbreaking here. I bought this for a few reason and those being: TnA, beat-em-up gameplay, and it was on sale. The boob jiggling in this game is over the top honestly. Most of them look like they have water balloons stuck to their chest and they jiggle around whenever they move an inch. That's not all characters though. Some of them are flatter than a days old soda, probably to even out the disproportiant boobage on the majority of the characters. I saw that people were talking about the booty, but the butt gets nowhere near the attention that the boobs do. Kind of a shame, really.I didn't do much story yet, but it's looking like it's just there so that you can have an excuse to fight other busty ladies and tear their clothes off. Probably the main selling point of the game is the nudity it has, though it never goes 100% full frontal. That's really to be expected though, this isn't Meet n' ♥♥♥♥ kingdom or somthing.

One for people who are new to the series and one for those who already played it on Vita.For newcomersThe biggest question for anyone who is not familiar with the series is ""Is there anything besides T&A to these games?"" and the answer to that is a definitive ""Yes!""Senran Kagura games' two strongest points, at least in my opinion, are combat and characters.Combat is quite simple and satisfying, combining the battles against hordes of various mobs and against other playable characters. The fighting is fast, colorful, and responsive. Each character has a truly unique playstyle and each player will be able to find their own favorite. There are speedsters, like Ikaruga and Hikage, brawlers, that rely on powerful, chargeable attacks, like Katsuragi and Yozakura, there are fighters that prefer to fight at the distance, like Mirai, and there are some quirky and cheesy fighters that rely on status effects, like Haruka.Characters are simply awesome. And I don't mean it in a ""good for an ecchi/fanservice"", I mean legitimately frigging awesome. Each character is truly unique, with great backstory, likable and varied personality, memorable quirks, and superb interactions with other cast members. They all are truly developed (pun intended) individuals that will make you love them. The addition of individual little story missions for each character also helps as it showcases them in various humorous situations.However, this particular game is not without its flaws. The difficulty curve is a little bit unbalanced. You're free to replay missions to level up your characters, but doing so even for a little bit makes future missions incredibly easy. There's also small variety in missions in general. Each time your mission is just ""Kill all mobs, move to the next area, kill all mobs, defeat the boss"".In short+ Simple, colorful, fast paced, and satisfying combat+ Great characters+ Unique and varied gameplay for each cast member+ Buttload of customization options- Unbalanced difficulty curve- Repetitive missionsI was also once a newcomer to the series and I was quite prejudiced against it based on its presentation. After giving it a try, however, I was able to see that there's much more to it. While all the titilation is always on the forefront, at some point you either stop paying attention to it or (just like characters in the game) start treating it as a joke. Basically, if you are interested, just give it a chance. You just might want to stay in this hometown.For those who already played it on Vita.Smooth as butter 60 FPS framerate and all DLCs. That's all I needed to pick up this game again. The framerate really does wonders enhancing the gameplay.So stop wasting your time and buy it! If we lucky they'll port Estival Versus next!Edit: Nominate it for the ""Best Life and Hometown"" Award!"

Not saying the fan service is bad, I like girls as much as the next guy, but I just don’t want to play this game focusing on boobs.(Though this is personal preference, it obviosly depends on the person playing if they mind this stuff or not)Besides the fan service, the game is actually pretty addicting and fun. It starts to get a bit repetitive at some point, but being able to level up each character, unlock new combos, new outfits, play as different schools, and more. made it worthwhile for me.In conclusion, if you can ignore the sexualization in the game (If you like it then it’ll be a plus for you) then you have a really fun Hack and Slash game that is worth the $27."

The game plays out mission based, and you play as any of the 3 academies (unlocking 1 more later on) which have about 5 or so different characters in each. With a somewhat serious attempt at a story the game uses it's stereotypical character archetypes to carry the bland narrative across to the end of the main section of the game.The combat in Shinovi Versus is maybe where most of the subtance is in this game, it's got a high volume of different girls you can choose from, all feeling different to play with the exception of a few of the different sword wielding ones, but even those have different ultimate abilities and combos that anyone will probably be able to find at least one character they like playing. The problem with the combat for me was honestly the lack of customization and depth that you don't get with the sheer volume of different characters to play as, and not only that, if you find a particular girl you like to play as, its mostly tough luck in the main story section of the game since you're forced to play everyone an equal amount of times. This is offset though by these little side missions where they are purely focused on one character and are great for letting the player pick and choose which characters they like and only play them. Which leads me to another problem is that not all of the characters are unlocked at the beginning and require you to beat the first 3 Academy's stories then you unlock another academy with a whole new cast of characters to play as. A bigger issue I have during combat is really the types of enemies that get to have 'Super Armor' Which if you haven't played many action games, it's basically whenever you attack an enemy and the enemy doesn't stagger at all, basically making it impossible or hard to combo these enemies. In Senran Kagura, this ability that some enemies have though, is not restricted to just bosses or really big enemies, even smaller and regular cannon fodder have it, and it gets extremely aggravating to the point of breaking it's own flow of combat. It's really the biggest single gripe with the game that I have to wonder if the developers of this game even ever played another action game before using this feature so heavily. It's not helped by the fact that you cannot cancel mid-combo meaning when you commit to mashing buttons, you better be 100% sure that you're going to hit all of your attacks before you even think about pushing the block or dash button.Senran Kagura is all about the player experience, it's tailored to make the player feel good and with a game focused around big bouncy bosom's and cheeky dialogue, it's only a given that you should be able to play virtual Barbie with each and every character in the game, customizing even down to the type of underwear they have on, which the player gets to see in gameplay when you take enough damage so your clothes rip off, or that you do enough damage to the enemy so that their clothes fall off just as well. There's no nudity though, the game censors itself kind of hilariously but modding the censor's off isn't worth it since there just isn't any nudity in the game at all. I feel the censoring works in the game's favor and fits with the overall themes of the game, but seeing how raunchy some parts of the game can be I could see how some players might feel 'short changed' because of the no nudity. I have to mention that this game was a PSVita port though, and was rated by the Japanese rating's board, CERO, which does not allow games with nudity to be sold at retail, or rather they give the game a rating to the equivalent an AO rating by the ESRB.So yeah, Senran Kagura isn't even a great game by any means, but it has a niche audience that it caters to and does what it sets out to do, actually pretty nicely.If the idea of Japanese high school ninja girls with big bosom's fighting sounds at all like something you'd enjoy, you'll probably enjoy this game in some way or another."

,Not Recommended,411830,33143339,Posted: 2 July,all,CthulhuChan,"I think half a days worth of playing is enough to properly judge this game right?No?Who cares.Senran Kagura is probably the HARDEST game I have ever had to review. Not that it's hard difficulty wise (more on that in a bit) but that it is just a weird game to talk about.Bottom line though, this game is merely alright at worst and a fun distraction at best.Have you ever heard of Dynasty Warriors? If yes, you've played the better version of this game.**GAMEPLAY:**This game takes the traditional 1v1000 gameplay from Dynasty Warriors aaaaaaaand breaks it. Enemies are often too aggressive or just plain tanky when they shouldn't be, and the maps are often so small and boring that it turns into a repetitive button mashing nightmare, keeping in mind I love the 1v1000 game style. But this is like a bootleg reproduction of that style, where you are mostly doing the same attack hearing the same voice clip from the same playing character AND THAT'S ANOTHER THING.Characters are barely unique from each other because there is a very easy solution to just about every single fight in the game that turns every character the same. Go Frantic, use your AoE. Instant kill on any target.Every character controls virtually the same, with vague differences in fighting style although the amount of impact feels rather muted to me. I think that the game would've benefitted from not trying to make these characters so fast since it sacrificed impact for moving at the speed of light when walking or slashing or... anything-ing.**Animation**In a 1v1000 style game you HAVE to get your animation correct, absolutely HAVE TO. Does this game?Sort of.This game has most of it's animation in Breast physics, and they suck. Look the breasts in this game for almost every character (Discount Mirai from this) are constantly bouncing and flopping so much ♥♥♥♥in DOA would blush.Being someone that this shouldn't bug it sadly bugs me GREATLY because things like hair and movement of the body get utterly trashed as a result of these boobie physics and their over emphasis. This game is animated like it was made on a budget, it looks like a budget game.As for the graphics, their alright. See the issue here is that even in the anime style (which I am obviously okay with) the characters still have some serious issues keeping normal looking with things like the environment looking very blocky and certain faces looking ridiculously bad. Whenever you bust off the clothing of opposing Shinobi (which is a key feature of this game) the cutscenes afterwards will almost always have graphical bugs all over the character's body which is VERY noticiable.**Originality**What does this game bring to the 1v1000 formula that others have not?Well, it's surprisingly dark for an anime game about♥♥♥♥♥♥ It also is pretty self aware about how silly the concept of itself can get. But if you've seen any ecchi anime in recent years you've seen this whole game. So this game brings very little to the table.With it's lack of characters, awful animation, and rather unpretty graphical errors... well.At least it stays at a consistent 60fps on a Dell Laptop.5/10."

Not all characters are equal here... after learning how to play all the characters, I have know learned 1 important thing. I am severely disadvantaged if I am playing the brat throwing jolly ranchers while facing the girls using swords/daggers/ and firearms.. Some characters are great, others are ok, some suck...Difficulty: Normal/Hard Hard Normal enemies have the intelligence of acorns...I was mid-mission and had my reasons for wanting to lower my hp (won't explain but it is for Ultimate skill) i sat there for like 5 minutes AFK and the enemy BOSS hit me 4x... Hard is also boringly easy some missions did give me trouble b/c I am bad with dealing w/ giant pandas... The only times I really lost were the begining when I was lvl 1 and didn't know what button was to attack, and when I deliberately let the enemy take me down to 20% hp in hopes of using ultimate skill, just to accidently fall into one of their chain attacks.Chain attacks... well like i said, combat can be kinda fun, if you are the one attacking, chains are sometimes easy as hell to escape, and sometimes you are trapped with the highest stats at full hp in 1 enemy chain attack that kills you.. (there is a blast move to get them off at the cost of some hp, this really only troubled me when i had  low hp to begin with for other reasons (if hp is too low you cant use that move and may be trapped in the chain for a while.)That... was much more than i hoped to type..

There's no mistaking that this game, and indeed the entire Senran Kagura series knows it's audience. It's full of fan service, and there's no beating around the bush on that, if you dislike fan-service you won't like this game. Period. All the ladies are well endowed with jiggle physics galore and lots of revealing clothing and clothing damage to reveal their oppai and pantsu!The characters are very trope-heavy, and it's easy to pick out common anime archetypes here, but the story works with that pretty well and presents a story where the relationships between the girls really shines through and you do end up caring to some degree how those relationships resolve (though whether they do or not is another story). You get to play as three schools of samurai girls, and an additional school after beating those stories. Each school has 5 shinobi girls to play as, with their own unique looks, personality, and move-sets. You can advance through most of the main story with the girl you choose, and each girl has a separate side-story for her alone giving you plenty of missions to advance through.The main gameplay takes place on special stages where you often have to fight through multiple waves of trash enemies. These parts feel very much like a Musou game (Dynasty Warriors) but with a greater emphasis on aerial movement. The end of levels usually has you square off against one of the other shinobi, either in a friendly bout, or a serious rivalry. These sections are more akin to 3D fighters, with the closest I can think of being the Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi series. You have a weak attack and strong attack, which you can further combine with aerial moves. There is also a limit break power, an aerial rave, blocks, parries, and you have 2 separate modes you can switch between. Panic which increases your damage output but seriously lowers your defense, and Shinobi which will heal you completely. When in Shinobi or Panic mode you can unleash special attacks called Ninja Arts after acquiring enough points (gotten through damaging opponents). You can cause clothing damage to your opponent through Ninja Arts and aerial raves. The stages themselves are fairly small but generally give you a decent area to fight in with some decent variety between them.Outside of the combat levels, you have a shop where you can buy costumes, accessories, movies, music tracks, and so on for your girls. There is also a Lingerie Lottery mini-game where you bet money to unlock new lingerie outfits for the girls, by betting more money you reduce the chance of getting a duplicate. There is a dressing room where you can change the girl's outfits and even ""test"" their jiggle physics by touching them. The outfits are divided between the main outfit they typically wear, the shinobi outfit seen when they transform, and the lingerie outfit seen during panic mode and after clothing damage. There's also different hairstyles and accessories as well. There is a library section where you can view various art works and unlocked movies as well as listen to music tracks, and a dojo that lets you play in various multiplayer games. Finally in the main room itself you can talk to the various other girls of that school and their conversation changes a bit after several missions are completed.Overall the game is rather fun, a tad repetitive at times but the core gameplay is solid. The fan service is rather good without being too explicit (there are bars of light censoring naughty bits). This is a port from a Playstation Vita game and it is done well, with even the button prompts being redone to match a 360 controller, and most of the game is in HD quality (although numerous lingerie outfits are noticeably low-res). Also all DLC formerly separate from the game in the Vita version is now bundled in the base game."

Not really my thing, The stickers and shinies have their own charm. There is at least 30 hours worth of content here. For $30 well worth it IMO.

The gameplay is simple and easy to grasp however I did get lost since there was no mandatory tutorial so if you do get it I reccomend going into the tutorial modes to grasp the controls, the visuals are allright for a ps vita port and it runs in 60fps. Vsync and the rest of the fancy stuff needs to be activated from your GPU's Control panel thingy...

,Recommended,411830,23337335,"Posted: 1 June, 2016",all,Sintacs,"I put a good bit of time into this on the Vita (was my first platinum over in the PlayStation camp), and will likely do the same here. Very fun hack-n-slash/beat-em-up laced with fan service. The controls are responsive and fluid, and the combat is quick, all great things to have in this kind of game. Many people like to label this as a ""Musou/Warriors"" sort of game, but the only things it really has in common is the hack-n-slash combat, and semi-large number of enemies, it lacks the objectives and defence points etc. that those sort of games had, something I found to typically be more of an annoyance than something I liked in them. The game does have a very large selection of playable characters (with the DLC characters included in this version), and they all play and feel unique form eachother for the most part. The story here isn't anything special, it's a side-game in the series with what essentially amounts to be a throw-away story (though the main story arc isn't particularly special either), but I feel this isn't a game that anybody would actually play for the story anyway (despite those who claim it's what they're here for). Visually it looks pretty good, nothing amazing, but do remember, this is a port of a Vita game, and it's a game that looked pretty great over there, and manages to hold up pretty well here. If you're into hack-n-slash/beat-em-up games, and aren't afraid of a bit (ok... a lot) of fan service, I definitely recommend it."

Once you find a character you're good with, they pretty much become universal, especially if you cap their Yin, Yang, and Flash skills. There's no hard counters in game, just fighting, which I'm okay with.I fight mostly as Ryona, shooting and dancing everywhere, and it's fun. Does enough damage too when it's time to punish.Also, there's alot of transformation sequences that can get old. Thank goodness they have a skip button for each one, even specials.For downsides, well it's really close to your normal DW game. Mobs, Bosses that are just comboing mobs, rare 2v1 events, and so on. Then there's the lack of that DW feeling of going into a huge swarm ofenemies, since you go to alot of premade areas and paths that give you limited enemies. YOu'll find yourself repeating missions often just to grind one character, which can become dull if you try for multiple characters.Also, get a controller. Even if it' a cheap one, it helps so much more than the keyboard. I could feel the cramping trying to dodge. DW had that in common, considering how you play anyways.They're slowly but sure fixing the bugs in the game (they're very few from my playthroughs) and I look forward to fully completing the game.Edit 8/14So I've beaten the game with all schools and I enjoyed the journey. Knowing that there's even more before this game and after it, it makes me want to watch the series and pickup Esitval Versus, even if I have tobecome a peasantbuy it on console. Yes, I'm interested in the story too. The boobs just covered up alot of it.The DLC char's Daidoji and Rin are broken to all hell btw, Rin moreso because of her speed. Daidoji is Jotaro and you cannot tell me otherwise.Lastly... Well, there's modding now. Only a bit but I'm sure that there'll be more options to extend the lifespan of this game. Will it last long enough to reach Estival Versus on PC? Nah, this isn't Skyrim. But I'm positive that the mods will keep things interesting.Alright, that's enough babbling.

If you ain't heard of it before I'mma keep it simple.You play as redonkulous ninja girls who beat the crap out of each other under the names of their competing good and evil schools. You don't go for the kill though. Just strip them of their dignity and clothes. Generic enemies are made to be plowed through a la Warriors/Musou. Big bad one on one fights are more an exchange of juggles, counters, and special attacks slightly more reminiscent of something like an Ultimate Ninja Storm game or something. It's all hack-n-slash either way. The story mode is basically a visual novel with battles mixed in. There's plenty of missions as well as unlockable outfits, and such to give it some pretty decent play time.It's actually pretty fun stuff. This isn't my first dive into the series and it's kept me coming back so far.I give it a solid 3 badonks and half a pair of jiggly jubblies out of 5."

Obviously since it's Senran Kagura you'll come into this game expecting a ton of fan service and you wouldn't be wrong. Nothing is too over the top though. I wouldn't be emberassed to play this in front of anyone I know or something like that.The characters all have their own fighting style that you have to learn, but it's not too overbearing since the combos are all very similar. The combat is too ""basic"" for some poeple, but I found it to be enjoyable.I treated this game more like a visual novel than a fighter, and I had a great experience. All of the characters have their own stories to work your way through, learning about their backgrounds and why they became ninjas. The combat gives you a nice break from reading. I think it was very well balanced.There's a ton of items/outfits/lingerie that you can mess around with, giving yourself some very unique characters.I thoroughly enjoyed my experience playing Shinovi Versus and I look forward to being able to buying and playing Estival Versus in the future."

The combat is some of the most repetitive I've ever played. Think dynasty warriors on a smaller scale where the large scale was one of its best qualities.The graphics are ok. There is no nudity here if you're looking for that. The clothes come off but it is still covered by hands or torn cloth or something.The story is lack luster. The game heavily relies on the fact that you may be here just to see boobs. That's not a bad thing, but it does it badly. Your hopes get dashed at every turn from start to finish. You begin hoping for good combat (its not). After you're dissapointed by that, you'll hope that the story is at least decent (it isnt). After you're dissapointed by that, you'll hope that it at least has some boobs (it does not).What you're left with after play this game if you dont happen to be one of its hardcore fans is a large portion of dissapointment."

,Not Recommended,411830,30521020,Posted: 15 March,all,Sally 4th,"Very repetitive. Unlike some of the Dynasty Warrior games, where you can combine light and heavy attacks to do a variety of different combos, this game has almost no variety in that regard.The one interesting mechanic is the transformation. Transformations heal you and allow you to use your special moves, but you can only transform once per fight. It's an interesting little bit of resource management that I really liked.Another positive point is the soundtrack. It has a bunch of rock remixes of classical music. I love it.On the sexual nature of the game: I'm no prude, but it's a little excessive. I was very pleased to find that there were many different costumes to unlock, but I was a bit disappointed when I found out that ALL of it is geared towards various fetishes. Its very limitng, and makes the wide variety of costumes actually fairly boring. Very few of the costumes look nice outside of their sexual appeal. Even then, most of the costumes aren't really all that sexy, in my opinion. I'd be all for sexy girlfs fighting in sexy outfits. I just don't think this game does a very good job of it.On the plus side, some of the girls default costumes look great. Yumi and Hikage's outfits are very sexy and cool, and I love Asuka's Strider-esque scarf.Also, I don't think this is outright stated in the game, but the implication I get is that not all the girls are over the age of 18. I didn't know this until after I bought and played the game. It's a bit icky, and really unnecessary. Nothing about the story necessitates the girls being underaged. One of the younger characters is a masochist who begs other characters to beat her. Having a young teenager do something like that is a bit much, I think. I guess it's not HUGE deal, since they're just animated characters. But I know it would bother some people, so I thought it was worth bringing up.If they refine the combat system and improve the costume options, then I could really enjoy this series. For now, though, there are better action games you could be playing, and better booby anime you could be watching."

But i hate this game for this gameplay and specs.Its a rather simple fighting gameplay except once you get into a fight u have no idea what the hell is going on. The game has a horrible difficult curve. You can only just spam the same combo until u slam until a wall when the enemy AI or Player will just pwn u with this special move that you're never taught about. Going into their story mode u expect to find a tutorial level where they quickly brief you on how to play the game. But you just hop in and get rekt without a clue on whats going on.Aside from the gameplay, the game only supports up tp 1080p 60fps. Thats good and all if u have a rig or laptop thats 5-10 years old but now most PC players have 1440p or even 8k setups that makes this game looks pixelated on these screens. Atleast its at 60fps...

I'd say it's average in every way as far as being a Musou game. I didn't care too much for the characters apart for maybe two or three. The game isn't ported all that great, with terrible Keyboard/Mouse controls, a sometimes jittery framerate (even on a decent PC), and not much in the settings department, but honestly that's to be expected. I guess if you like anime girls and don't mind okay-but-still-very-repetitive gameplay this would be an easy recommendation (on sale). I bought it at around 20USD if I remember correctly and I think that's a bit too steep for me.EDIT: Now that I think about it, the environment/effect visuals aren't great when compared to other similar games either. Lots of generic, almost stock-looking assets that do fit with the style, I'll give it that, but are kinda painful to look at nonetheless.EDIT AGAIN, STILL LIKE 2 MINUTES AFTER POSTING THE INITIAL REVIEW: The trading cards for this game have phenomenal art.

I honestly thought it was gonna be something different, like a mindless hack and slash something simmilar to Dynasty Warriors. I was wrong. It's more along the lines of an arena fighting game, not massive battles (which honestly from the Steam trailer it looked like that).The game's mechanics are solid for a fighting game, and yes the game is fanserviced to HELL but I'm guessing that is what the series is known for so that doesn't bother me. Plus if you get tired of the fanserviced boobs and butt shots you can skip them which is nice because they get repetitive. It would be nice to have an option to turn them off. Sure they are cool at first but they do get old after awhile.The graphics aren't bad, though it is a game ported from PSP (or PS Vita I forgot lol) so it is obvious with some of the character models being a bit not smooth (not sure if that is gramatically correct but what the hell), the intro cutscene is all text, the environments are small and limited, and that the game only supports resolutions up to 1080p (I have a 1440p monitor).At the game's price of $29.99, it's just too expensive for this game. It feels way overpriced for what you are getting. This is a game that would be better set for like $5 or $10.

You'll be doing the same thing over and over again which is being put in a small area where you beat up some small fries that holds no threat at all, then proceed to fight the boss that erotically transforms when they almost die. Rinse and repeat.The multiplayer seems to be held in good regards by the fans, but i didn't bother with it since none of my friends actually play this game.Buy it only if you like beat em ups and tearing anime girls' clothes off to see some anime boobs, and maybe if you're into some kawai anime ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.

76561198142334643,Not Recommended,411830,24089736,"Posted: 4 July, 2016",all,WTFantastico,"I can't go in-depth with my analysis on this game as I've only played 100 minutes of it, but I can at least describe what caused me to refund the game. I skipped every cutscene in order to get as far into the game as I could before Steam's refund window passed me by, thinking I could always go back and watch them later. Another game I would have liked to refund stripped much of my time away with cutscenes, and now it sits permanently in my library, a harsh reminder of money wasted.Fine-movement and precision in this game are impossible, making the controls feel very loose. Your character will move frantically about regardless of the type of input you provide. While this itself isn't terrible, it does necessitate the inclusion of much ""assisted targetting"" wherein your character is homed into an enemy whenever you attack. This makes combos essentially create themselves, solely requiring button mashing to make a perfect combo.For attacking, you're given a strong and light attack with which you build combos through preset trees each character has. Now, I only unlocked about 3 tree expansions for roughly 7 characters each, but they did nothing to change up combos. Whether or not you make use of the heavy attack options or op for mashing light to finish a string, the same amount of damage will be done, the same followup opportunity will be activated, the hitboxes remain roughly identical, changes in combo safety are minimal, but mashing light will often give you a higher combo count.""Missions"" consist of either hacking through a small group of lower level enemies before fighting a playable character or simply fighting the playable straight away. Missions lasted anywhere between a minimum of 20 seconds and a maximum of 1min10sec with the average resting at around 1 min for mobs (very very small mobs) and 30 seconds for bosses. I'm a neophyte, and bosses are torn down in roughly 30 seconds. The difficulty can be increased, making the bosses absorb more damage, but the combat is so shallow that I bore withing even 30 seconds. These missions are, of course, bookended by loading screens, each of which takes roughly 10-15 seconds. They're short, for load screens, but you'll be spending a lot of time in them relative to the gameplay. Besides that, while fighting bosses cutscenes will constantly be activated by their transformations, their special attacks, when their clothing gets ripped, etc. and it is a jarring and frequent wrench in the pace of combat. All of these cutscenes can be skipped, but they are so frequent that even their startup time before you skip them amounts to an obnoxious amount of time, collectively.The game has a clothes-breaking ""mechanic"" wherin cutscenes are triggered when clothing is ripped. I put ""mechanic"" in quotes as this has no effect on gameplay other than to cut away from it for a prebaked animation that I've seen more than 30 times in just 1.7 hours. Breaking of clothing will happen when the boss takes a predetermined amount of damage, whether you try and aim for it or not. It's a hollow experience.This game, as is likely clear, has a lot of emphasis on female nudity. I thought, at first, that this would be something that would be handled well. Something lighthearted and stimulating; something that would be played for laughs as a sort of mockery of the trope while also being a player of that same game. The way the T&A is actually handeled, however, is very unironic. The tone is always ""ooh, come here, big boy. Look how SEXY I am. Oh yeah. Let me press my boobies together. *giggle*"" and it feels like it's genuinely expecting me to swoon. As a result, what could've been both a satirical, as well as sexy, facet of the game only provides a very icky-feeling and awkward experience.All in all, this game is not terrible in its execution, but it's completely useless. What I mean is that, for everything this game does, other games have done it better. It feels like a game of this quality has no place in the context of modern games as it provides significantly less than both its peers and predecessors. I bought this on sale at $26.99, but I would hesitate to pay even $10 for it. For what it provides, I might think $8 would be fair. It's a rough critique, I know, but I'm trying to be as honest as possible. At the very least, skip through the cutscenes if you're willing to try this game out so that you can get a real feel for what the game is before you decide to keep it."

Before seeing it streamed on Twitch, I never would have thought it was a series I might enjoy, and before playing it truly did not realize. But its actually amazing fun. Tight, solid gameplay, a great sense of humor, and fan-service everywhere. Personally I find the fan service more amusing than tittilating, but whether you are here to oogle the breasts or giggle at them, as long as you are not uptight about the jiggles you will find a lot to like about this game. It is basically a dynasty warriors clone with extra helpings of T and A, but I think its base gameplay is arguably more solid than Dynasty Warriors.

Actually I stated to get annoyed at the fan service scenes during battle that show up when you rip part of your opponent’s cloths, since this very short cut scene will most of the time break your combo string and shift momentum to the enemy. I got really into the game and I love almost all the characters move sets. There are only two characters in the game I hate because they are not interesting and they have awful moves, but I won’t say which ones because I don’t want to get flamed.Most characters have a surprisingly sad backstory for what looked like a light hearted game, which was also a surprise…I realize now that by avoiding saying names to prevent complains I can’t go into much detail about the game…But it’s good, really good. It has something for everyone. It has all the major fetishes covered  and a customization option for extra fetishism.The major negative for me is the lottery. As you play the chance of winning goes down, and when you’re one piece short for completion the chance of winning goes to 1% to a max 3%, but my problem is not this, is that you can’t skip the “surprise reveal” of your ticket, even when you are fully aware it’s not going to be it."

76561198272293789,Recommended,411830,30041721,Posted: 19 February,all,ShadowRaven,It is a very good game. I love the anime art style and the hack and slash action combat. One thing however to point out is that it is very hard to control the camera without a controller. I had some difficulties so I had to change my key bindings so it was easier for me to move the camera while fighting (since the camera doesn't follow wherever your mouse goes.) But other than that I highly recommend this game for people who are looking for an action filled anime combat game.

,Recommended,411830,29080754,Posted: 6 January,all,Urrnge,"Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus is a beat em up kinda game where it's one character against an army of enemies, plus a boss fight towards the end. It's also a game that has a crap-ton of fanservice added in. You know,♥♥♥♥♥n' ♥♥♥♥♥♥s and such. Like any sane person, I enjoy that kinda stuff, so my interest was piqued when I first heard about it. The fanservice is what draws you in, but the gameplay is what makes you stay. I had a lot of fun playing this game, and I am very picky when it comes to beat em up games. When you start, you pick from one of 3 schools, each with 5 characters in it and they have a different fighting style and personality. For the most part, they are all pretty likeable. Some are obviously superior, like best girl Murasaki, while some are just kinda there, like Yozakura. Still though, you're gaurenteed to have a favorite character. Some of the character interactions were also a bit funny, so that's another thing I liked about the game.So yeah, if you like anime, beat em up/hack & slash games, and/or boobs, then this is the game for you."

,Recommended,411830,29322434,Posted: 17 January,all,#backseat gamer,"im not an action-arcade game player to begin with.i found this game fun to play, the animation is smooth, the combos are easy to learn, bots are ok (in hard mode and bosses only. the others? they just standing there and shoot once in about 10 sec)it is well ported.the story itself isn't long. you can finished it by 1 day. since the multiplayer is also there, there's still some more to explore.graphics are not top class but not bad at all.i dont think the characters are balanced at all or may be im too noob with this game. I found short range and slow attack animation characters are very hard to play especially against the long range. e.g. i failed 3 times against Rin. she's the most OP opponent imo.about sexual content, it has some but this is an action game so dont expect much. but since this is a japanese game, you know how extreme my 'much' is. other reviews, comments already give some picture about this matter.recommend? well i think it's worth my $10. (winter sale) probably play some mission with some characters again. but for Minori, Katsuragi, Mirai, im done with you guys."

This is the definitive way to play this as, if you have hardware specs above what is stated is the minimum, you will have a constant 60FPS. Great port from the vita as the vita version dipped below 30FPS too frequently.If you like boobs and cute girls along with high production values, scoop this game up. The controls are really nice and as a bonus, if you like attack combo trees from fighting games, this will give you that complexity but easy enough that it's not stupid."

,Recommended,411830,33770719,Posted: 24 July,all,Clockwork Ultimate Peon,"Senran Kagura, infamous for its crude fan service, busty ninja girls, and over-the-top ability animations. The game runs very well, and I have had zero issues in terms of performance and framerate on my end, running on a rather below average laptop. Lots of characters, lots of customization, and a host of stuff to do to scratch anyone's completionist itch.Pros-Many playable characters (20+) that all have a unique personality and abilities.-Expansive customization options. From hair styles, to clothing and accessories, there are a lot of options you can have with each character, and any item you unlock for one is available for any other. You can also fully manipulate the position, size, and angle of any accessory, allowing for some ""interesting"" options.-Multiple playable stories. Each school has a playable storyline revolving around their respective 5 shinobi. While it tends to follow a story very similar to other schools, it is a nice introduction to each character and their individual and group goals.-Many side missions. Each character has 5 ""Shinobi Heart"" missions to complete, afterwards unlocking additional cosmetic options and library assets. It can take quite some time to get through all of them,-Fun over-the-top animations. Character abilities are very colorful and energetic, and it feels very satisfying to watch that combo meter go up.-Very good as a ""pick up, put down"" game. If you only have a bit of time, you can do a mission or two before having to head out. It can also work well if you plan on sitting down for longer sessions.Cons-Characters start off somewhat weak. First few levels with any character means shallow combos, lower health and damage, and a tougher time in higher level missions. You may have to grind missions a bit with characters you are not as skilled with.-Later missions drag on a bit. Bosses begin to have a lot more health, and use tactics that might make it a bit harder to take them down. Early missions can also be easily cheesed later on by abusing frantic mode.-Some characters are overall a bit clunky to use. Characters like Mirai are difficult to play due to weak damage, and unreliable crowd clear without scrolls. Other characters may attack too slowly, and are easily interrupted mid combo.-Story is ""meh"". Not really complicated, and each school is basically an alternate-world version of the others.Misc/Other-Humor and fan service is extremely hit or miss. I personally enjoy it, but some people may find it more or less detracting from the experience. It can be disabled in-game, however.-The ""Lingerie Lottery"" is more or less just a time-consuming random-chance lottery to unlock 100+ pairs of different lingerie. There's alsoNOachievement or unlocks tied to it besides the lingerie itself.-It can be a little bit frustrating navigating between menus if you want to customize multiple characters.-You can't play Shinobi Heart Missions as characters other than the one they are meant for, even after completion-You will almost never use your ultimate shinobi art, as the requirements far outweigh the benefit. You must have 5 shinobi scrolls, and be at critical health to use it.Overall, I actually really enjoyed Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus, and for more reasons than the fan service. The humor, while hit or miss, did make me laugh out loud at some moments, and the short-session method of slowly unlocking everything in the game made it a nice game to pick up and put down. I was able to obtain all achievements and unlock everything in game pretty reasonably, so it isn't too much of a challenge for any sort of completionist. Noticeable flaws would be that it can become a bit repetitive, and some missions begin to feel very similar to previous ones. Otherwise, I do definitely recommend this game, whether you are a fan of Dynasty Warriors-like games, or a connoisseur of fanservicey games.8.5/10"
