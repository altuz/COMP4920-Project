Easily worth full price. The remaster is amazing and really breathes new life into the game. If you want to play a fun platformer adventure game this is a good start.Play time to 100% the game including hidden artwork was 14.6 hours.
,Recommended,411960,24235743,"Posted: 10 July, 2016",all,connor,"Ty the Tasmanian TigerIf you've played and enjoyed (how couldn't you?) Ty the Tasmanian Tiger in the past,you should pick up this game now. You wouldn't be looking at reviews if you weren't considering it already.That said, on to the review for those of you that still aren't so sure. Ty the Tasmanian Tiger was originally released on Gamecube, the original Xbox, and the PlayStation 2. I spent countless hours getting lost in this game as a kid and I was ecstatic to see that they decided to port it over to PC.At the time of writing this review, the game in still in Early Access. Let me tell you for a fact, it feels far from it. This game is an excellent console to PC port.StoryThe story is pretty accessible, but you have to pay attention to some of the NPCs' dialogue and cutscenes if you want to really follow along. It can be easy to miss. If you accidentally skip a cutscene, you can watch them from the main menu.The NPCs in this game are amusing and somewhat inept. You might feel compelled to call child protective services on one of them as she keeps losing her children, but thankfully you're there just in time to step in and save the day.GameplayTy is a 3D platformer. You can do mostly what you'd expect with a game of this genre. You can jump, swim, glide, and climb your way through levels. The movement mechanics are tight, so any issues with falling off or missing a jump is probably your fault, as it should be.In every level there will be enemies for you to take down, items to collect, and friends to help. Thankfully, you will be growing an arsenal of boomerangs to help you accomplish these tasks with style. I really enjoy the variety of boomerangs to collect. Some are more utilitarian to help you find hidden items, and others can set your enemies on fire or slow down time. There's a 'rang out there for just about everyone.Once the story is said and done, there's quite a few collectibles to find if you're up for it. They don't take a shocking amount of time to find, but if you don't look closely or consider alternative approaches to finding them then you may find yourself wandering a level for a couple of hours. Some of the levels arebig.For the competitive gamers out there, you can try to climb the leaderboards for each level! I personally haven't looked too far into these, but they appear to be working just fine.ControlsI don't currently have a USB gamepad, so my entire experience with this on PC has been with the keyboard and mouse we've come to know and love. Let me tell you, they feelgreat.I have only had a few minor issues with the controls:Some menu UI elements cannot be clicked on, forcing you to use the keyboard rather than the mouse. (The developers actually have a disclaimer for this one and I trust they'll get around to it before the game leaves early access).In the level ""Beyond the Black Stump"",aiming Ranger Ken's snowball launcher with W, A, S, D is pretty hard as it kind of jerks around by a certain distance. Rather than aiming for the frills I had to aim where I knew their path would take them and spam the fire button to take them down.When rapidly jumping up the small cliffs that form stairs for Ty on levels like ""Snow Worries"", the camera will jerk unpredictably and somehow bury itself beneath the terrain for a second or two, obstructing your vision entirely.You might have to dial the mouse sensitivity down, I know I sure did.VisualsThe Developers have been hard at work remastering the game to make it feel more at home on modern systems. I played through the game at 2560x1440 (I saw lots of resolutions in the menu too) and its a definite improvement. They're continually releasing graphical improvements while keeping the game minimum-spec friendly.The story-line cutscene videos are still low-res, but the developers are working on updating those as well. You can stillsee and understand what's going on in the cutscenes though.The color palettes are bright and varied. I don't like to place much of an emphasis on a game's visuals because there are more important aspects to it. Keep in mind this is a game originally released in 2002. Don't expect Crysis and you'll be fine.Based on the hardware reports, it looks like the game runs fine on Integrated Intel chips. If you're rocking a laptop without a discrete GPU, you should be good.I haven't noticed any graphical issues like artifacting or textures not loading.I would comment on the audio but I don't think there's anything wrong with it and I can't muster much of an imaginary comparison from my past because I'm pretty sure the last time I played this game was over a decade ago (oh my god). It's also worth noting I'm a bit hearing impaired so I don't pick up on much of the audiophile stuff. The game sounds great to me, so that's all I've got.Conclusion & other thoughtsLike I said before, if you've played Ty in the past and you liked it, you owe it to yourself to pick this game up. It's more than a compulsory nostalgia purchase as the game continued to entertain me while I played through it and collected everything (I didn't 100% it when I played as a kid, 'cause I was stupid).If you've never heard about Ty the Tasmanian Tiger before today, I hope this review alongside some of the others may have convinced you to try it. It's a great game, developed by people who really care about it (you'll frequently find the Developers in the discussions, responding to feedback, watching the Summer Games Done Quick speed-run).I'm looking forward to seeing where the developers take this game. I know they have a few more improvements in the pipeline but the game feels like a finished product to me. They did a great job.The more copies they sell, the more reasons they have to port Ty 2 and Ty 3. Let's make it happen, people!!!"

The game clearly takes inspiration of those and even wears some of the design decisions on its sleeve. Ofcourse there is absolutely nothing wrong with that when its done well.And well they did!Let's look at the pros and cons!Pros:-------- Fun and varied gameplay- Great and fitting soundtrack for each individual level- Cute characters and simple story- Varied and well designed environments- Fairly good port from the PS2- Addicting to get 100%Cons:--------- Framerate drops in certain areas (Early Access)- Sometimes questionable level design (example: certain spikes emerging out of the ground are unavoidable)- Most boomerangs you get throughout the game are pretty much worthless as they get overshadowed by others.- Sometimes janky camera which can make you miss your jump(i got used to it and actually didnt mind the camera in the long run)Subjective Cons:--------------------- Awkward dialogue from time to time- I've noticed people have been annoyed by the recurring ""introduction talk"" of ""Maury"" the bird, who is essentially your guide, much like the fairy ""Navi"" from ""The Legend Of Zelda"" who keeps on annoying you with her ""listen""! While i personally wasnt irritated by it, i can see why others where. Almost every 10 meters the game comes to a halt, throws in a cutscene and ""wants"" you to listen to what you need to do (you can skip it though). The frequent cutscenes only happen in the first level and it does make sense to put them there but they could have went about conveying information in a different way. On the other hand you have to keep in mind that this game was initially directed towards a younger audience.Final thoughts:-----------------If you enjoy/enjoyed 3D platformers like Super Mario 64 (or, for the newer generation, Jack & Daxter, Ratchet & Clank etc.) then this is one you should definitley pick up. It's just as fun as i remember it to be back in the days of the PS2 and i can't recall a dull moment with it whilst playing it again on Steam!Final verdict:--------------9.0/10with the ""FUN STAMP"" of approval!"

I feel like my 'childhood games' are always too obscure to be considered classics. But finding out that people not only remembered, but cared enough about Ty to port it to pc was amazing! It's a great port - the controls are about as good as you could get on a keyboard and it's certainly optimized better than an emulator.Even if you never played the original it's a pretty good example of the kind of gamecube/ps2-era 3D platformers that don't really exist anymore these days.

,Recommended,411960,29938551,Posted: 15 February,all,Waccoon,"A fantastic port of one of the underrated standouts among the character-driven 3D platformers in the PS2 era.  This is everything an HD conversion should be, as not only does it feature properly enhanced graphics for modern systems, but load times are blisteringly fast and both menus and controls have been significantly improved over the original release.TY itself is an easy but enjoyable platform game with well-designed levels, tons of visual flair, and lots of stuff to collect.  There isn't much story and the game isn't terribly innovative, but it's crafted with enough polish to satisfy casual gamers looking for a few laughs over 5-10 hours depending on your acquisition  OCD.  It was infamous for rather twitchy controls which normally would not age well, but this update has addressed most of the serious control and camera problems.  I highly recommend playing with a mouse, though you'll need to tone the sensitivity way down if you value your sanity.My major gripe is that the boss battles can be very confusing and have no continuity with either the character development or the story, but thankfully there's not many of them and they're not terribly difficult.  There are also some jumping puzzles that require pixel precision (par for the course in the early 90's).Overall, well worth the entry fee and a wonderful nostalgia kick updated by the original development label.  Every classic game should receive this kind of treatment if a re-release is being considered.TY 2 is currently in development, and hopefully the entire trilogy will be released eventually.  I eagerly await the next installment!"

Compared with the disaster that big companies like Capcom have done with thier original Resident Evil, this should set an example for those big companies on how it's done.I have nothing much to review on the game itself. It is still the original Ty, but with higher resolution, better colors, smoothened edges and other visial improvements that make this classic stand out in today's modern hardware. Sound is the same, but obviously remastered as well, so it comes out crystal clear. And last the controls are surprisingly better than in the original game and plays incredibly well with the Xbox One controller on Steam.Obviously it cannot be compared with modern games when it comes to gameplay, but for nostalgic purposes and the effort from the developers, I must give this a 10/10."

As this is a collectafon this can be quite concerning as there are 300 opals and missing one can cause me 20 -30 mins of in-depth back peddling and searching.The second problem is that some smaller levels ('like snow worries' on high platforms) can allow you to view outside of the map into a black void. This probably due to the 16 : 9 aspect ratio and these maps weren't necessarily scaled for widescreen displays.As you can see this is a very small list of complaints, and that is because I believe that these Devs have made something truly great and worth your time! All I can say is I wish the Devs my most thanks as it has rekindled something I thought was long dead from my childhood.Keep Up the good work guys!

,Recommended,411960,22015045,"Posted: 23 March, 2016",all,Gustavia,"Now I got really surprised when I saw the first game of one of my favorite game franchises as a child on Steam. I never played this game though since I never managed to get my hands on it when I was young but I played the second game Bush Rescue religiously and even then this game managed to make me feel super nostalgic with the Australian themed soundtrack, the sound effects I recognized from Bush Rescue and to just see Ty on my screen once again.Now there are some things you need to know before purchasing this game. Ty the Tasmanian Tiger was originally developed for the PS2 so this game is a port and since the PS2 differs a lot from todays computers and modern day consoles there are some issues plaguing the game. First, the game lacks a lot of options you expect a modern day PC game to have, there are right now at the 24th of March 2016 only three options and those are shadows, reflections and render distance. Second, the game has performance issues sadly but according to the developers that's because the game was originally locked to 30FPS and with updated graphics and unlocked framerate the game suffers from severe frame drops here and there. The option that tanks your framerate the most is the shadows so if you want 60 all the time then turn off shadows completely, but on some levels you can still have 60 with shadows on so you can also switch back and forth on the go. But all these issues is why the game is in early access, the complete game is here, I've already beaten the game but the developers need funds to upate the game so it will match modern day games with a bunch of graphics options and fixed performance so expect this game to be pretty darn great in the near future if enough people buy the game. And if this game sells well then they will port and update Ty 2 and 3 to Steam as well.The gameplay is your standard collect-a-thon platformer with a bunch of stuff to collect like cute small imprisoned Bilbies, Opals, Golden Cogs that you use to get different types of Boomerangs, Thunder Eggs which is the items you collect to drive the story forwards, Rainbow Scales which will give you more HP if you collect them all and Picture Frames which unlocks concept art and if you collect them all you unlock a movie. There are several types of boomerangs for you to unlock and use, ice boomerangs which freezes enemies and lets you create ice blocks on water for you to walk on, explosives boomerangs that will annihilate your enemies and a boomerangs which bounces from enemy to enemy. The combat is pretty solid as well, enemies die from one to two hits and it's always fun to throw your boomerangs on the enemies while jumping around on platforms and collecting a bunch of stuff.The story, like the gameplay is pretty simple too. You play as Ty who is a young brave Tasmanian Tiger whos parents got imprisoned by Boss Cass while they where defending the Talismans which are the MacGuffins of this story since Boss Cass wants them to take over the world and Ty and his friends wants them to restore balance and peace. You travel around from level to level collecting items like Opals and Bilbies to earn Thunder Eggs which your Koala friend Julius needs to power his Talisman finding machine so you can find the Talismans before Boss Cass does.tl;drPositive:+Nice fluid gameplay+Pretty great soundtrack that matches the Australian feel of the game+A bunch of different weapons+Tons of collectibles+Great level design+Fun charactersNegative:-Limited graphical options and performance issues as of 24/3 - 16-Pretty easy final boss-Shazza's race on the Outback Safari level-Game does not include Batarangs"

76561198126520825,Recommended,411960,31782332,Posted: 15 May,all,gretgor42,"When Ty the Tasmanian Tiger was released, back in 2002, I was 12 years old. I missed out on it because I didn't own any ""nextgen"" video game consoles back then. That's a shame, 12-year-old me would have loved it way more than I like it now, and I do. This is a game that's good and worthwhile, but features some problems common to 3D platformers from back in its time which make it not as good as it had all the right to be.The game follows the story of Ty, a Tasmanian tiger (well, duh) who is supposedly the last descendant from a proud tribe that fought off evil avian fiend Boss Cass, foiling his ultimate plan of obtaining the five talismans of unfathomable power in his attempt dethrone mammals from the top of the food chain to honor his dinosaur ancestry. The game itself kicks off with Ty casually playing hide and seek with his adoptive family of bilbies when, suddenly, he falls into a hole and meets the spirit of an odd sage of sorts. The spirit tells Ty about his ancestors' deeds, and that Boss Cass is trying to gather the talismans again, and that Ty is the only one who can stop Cass's evil plans. There's something rather charming and nostalgic about the pre-rendered cutscenes used in this game instead of in-engine cutscenes that are more common nowadays. I really enjoy those, if only for the retro feel alone. As a main character, Ty strikes me as an awesome, enthusiastic, energetic and brave marsupial that is always ready to run around, hop on difficult platforms and land his boomerang on every baddie's face.To aid Ty in his quest, he counts with a roster of endearing NPC friends, all based on Australian animals, each with their own charmingly exaggerated cartoon-esque personality. In fully voice acted (take note, Yooka-Laylee) cutscenes, they tell Ty about small missions he has to accomplish in order to gather special tokens, as well as hints about the controls and the game's mechanics, and warnings about the evil fiends and hazards that Ty may need to face ahead of him. Every character has an awesome Australian accent which adds even more charm to this radical outback adventure, and every cutscene and dialog in the game is rich in silly yet endearing humor. Among the roster of characters, there's the aforementioned titular character, plus an old cockatoo named Maurie who sounds like a wise yet slightly crazy old man, a koala scientist named Julius who acts in a stereotypical nerdy way that's rather endearing, and an awesome handful of others. I particularly like the mysterious Sly, and it saddens me that the game's story didn't explore this character in more detail at all.Speaking of outback, the overall graphical design in this game is spot on, in spite of the low tech nature of it. Sure, they may look way too polygonal, pointy and unappealing for today's standards, but they're nothing if not effective in capturing that neat Australian feel, in both the scenery and the characters. Rainbow Cliffs looks and feels like a spot on Australian scenery, and every level represents, in one way or another, some kind of landscape that one may encounter in Australia, except with awesome platforming and treacherous traps thrown in for good measure. In his journey, Ty will go through rainforests, the outback desert itself, snowy mountains, beaches, and many other kinds of natural landscapes that occur in Australia, and that makes for an epic thematic experience I really enjoy.As far as sound goes, I like the voice acting and the sound effects, they're appropriately comical and cartoonish, and fit well with the atmosphere of the game. The dialogs are particularly funny, always featuring some comedic exchanges and overall endearingly cheesy personalities. The music is nice as well, going for a mix between relaxing guitar music and some Australian tribal instruments (like the didgeridoo), always sounding appropriately upbeat when needed, and more calm and contained when the situation calls for it. It's always catchy, though, and that's a plus in my book. As I write this, I have the Rainbow Cliffs song stuck in my head.Speaking of Rainbow Cliffs, I find the way this game deals with level design rather interesting. Rainbow Cliffs serves as an ""open world"" area of sorts, full of tiny secrets to be uncovered and serving as a hub area to enter the levels as well as a safe, open space for you to test out your movement skills. The levels themselves are an interesting beast: while some 3D platformers from the past went for straight-up linear levels with maybe a few secret passages (like the original Crash Bandicoot or the PS1 Pac-Man game) and others went for the open-level fetch quest style (like, say, Super Mario 64 or Banjo-Kazooie), this game goes for a mix between the two approaches. Every level has a linear-ish path that the player may follow from beginning to end, but along the path there are some more open-ish places that players may want to explore in order to find special tokens, discover shortcuts and special areas, accomplish certain missions assigned to them by the NPCs or rescue some bilbie friends. This semi-linear approach is effective because you hardly ever feel lost (and even if you do, every level counts with a map that you can look at by pressing the menu button) but it still gives you something more to do than simply going straight from start to finish. The movement mechanics themselves work fine, and the individual sections of the levels are well designed to the point where it's fun to run, jump, battle, swim, glide and do whatever else you need to do to get them Thunder Egg thingies.This semi-linear design, however, comes with a price that I can't overlook: it sometimes tries to force the player to follow the predetermined path in the cheapest ways possible, like invisible walls and twisty, redundant paths. It feels realy cheap to not be able to jump to something that's right in front of you because of a stupid invisible wall that's disguised as a handful of foresty-looking sprites. This kind of thing was way too common in platformers back in the day, limiting the player's exploration possibilities, and it throws me off a bit.Now, one thing I really like about this game's overall mechanics is the ""key-and-keyhole"" aesthetic of acquiring new skills and applying them to open new paths. Whether it's gliding with two boomerangs, swimming, or any other skill that Ty may get to learn during the game, learning new skills in a level always opens up new possibilities, both in previous levels where something may have been out of reach (or just hard to reach) in your first visit, and in Rainbow Cliffs, where you're finally able to access a rainbow scale that you couldn't get to before, or a new set of levels to play in order to obtain some Thunder Eggs. The feeling of satisfaction you get when you obtain a new power that allows you to get to a place that you previously located but couldn't reach is one of the things I like the most in games, as it gives the experience a sense of progression that no other form of media has. I do feel like this aspect of the design should have been explored more than it was, maybe adding some extra secret stuff that you can only open with the right 'rang, but that could have alienated portions of the target audience that prefer their games to be straight-forward, it's okay that they chose not to do that.Now, I know I complimented the level design a lot, and while it's definitely good, it is far from perfect. One huge problem I have are the bosses which, while mostly fun, may sometimes be pretty close to impossible to figure out on your own if you're dumb like me. I had to look up walkthroughs for three of the bosses, including the final battle one, and I can't help but assume this is a flaw of the game itself. I mean, I never had problems figuring out bosses in any other 3D platformer, so maybe this one didn't care to make the bosses intuitive to figure out."

In the game, you play as the Thyracine named Ty, who stumbles upon a cave of paintings depicting the destruction of the Outback by one known as Boss Cass, a Cassowary, who threatens to revert the Outback to prehistoric times, putting cold-blooded lizards at the top of the food chain once again. It is up to Ty and his band of fauna to put a stop to the stubborn bird's plans.Having sunk 15 hours into the game, I was able to complete the game at 100%, including all Steam achievements (and this was at a relaxed pace, and knowing what to do due to previous experience).  I would say that a newcommer to the series would be able to beat the game to 100% in 24 hours.

I saw it on steam and figured I'd give it a shot.Boy I'm glad I did.  This game was one of the many ""early 2000's"" platformers / collectathons that were oh so popular back then.  Some others of note being the Jak and Daxter series, ratchet and clank, hell, even spongebob battle for bikini bottom.  A bunch more too.Anyways, the movement is a little bit faster than you'd expect at first, but you get used to it.Nine levels to explore with a bunch of different boomerangs to collect.  You could probably blaze through the game pretty fast if you wanted to, but it's well worth grabbing as much as you can along the way.  The maps are fairly large later on.The game is very forgiving with some mechanics that other games are much more blunt with.  For example, you can swim underwater for a LONG time before drowning, which is really nice.  Checkpoints are frequent and deaths do not interrupt boss battles.  The boomerangs are essentially infinite ammo ranged weapons with some strings attached depending on the set you are using.The game has a very nice flow with the animations used.  SMOOTH AS BUTTER!  The game runs pretty well on low to midrange systems, so you shouldn't have to worry about lowering settings.Story wise, it's a little all over the place, but that's OK given it's a platformer with multiple different levels with very different settings.  The cutscenes have a sort of TV-show quality that seemed ""OK"" but didn't really detract from the overall experience.to summarize:+ 2000's era platformer, find the things to get to the next place to find the things, etc.+ BOOMERANGS!  Fun as hell to use.+ Diverse levels with mixed platforming and combat.+ No major glitches of note.+ Interesting boss fights+ Looks fantastic, some subtle graphical updates really make this 15-year-old game shine.+ Voice acting is great.  Get used to australian accents and words that leave the uninitiated confused.~ Music is good, but gets repeditive.~ Camera can get a little wonky in some areas, but is overall fine.- 100% can be a grind if you miss certain collectibles on your first run through. There is a cheat code that reveals collectibles that you can use if you really need to.If you are looking for that authentic early 2000's platforming experience, I highly recommend this game."

I probably spent the better part of one thousand hours wearing down my old PS2 disk years ago. I came back to it with the port here on Steam, and I can conclusively say that this is the best port I know to have been put on Steam, ever. The devs (the same studio from all the way back in 2002, though maybe not all the original staff) really put their hearts and souls into getting this classic to work on PCs. As near as I can tell, they even managed to convince the decade-and-a-half-old ORIGINAL GAME ENGINE to accept such modern amenities as adjustable graphics settings and, get this, re-bindable controls for keyboard. If that doesn't speak to the quality of both the game and the team behind it, then nothing does.On to the game itself. The plot surrounds the eponymic character Ty, who is on a quest to save his family after they were imprisoned by the main antagonist, Boss Cass. The story makes somewhat little sense, but given the game's premise (anthropomorphic tiger collecting balls of light to save his family), I'll forgive it for that. Compare it to the likes of Banjo-Kazooie and you'll see that story generally came second or third to gameplay at the time this game came to be.The game handles just like I remember from when I was young. It certainly isn't perfect; the camera can be mildly wonky and the jumping behavior is inconsistent at times, but Ty handles well and the biggest factor in the platforming is player skill, as it should be. One thing the game most certainly is NOT, is difficult. I 100%'d the game, at least as far as progress on the save is concerned (there's some extra stuff that doesn't count towards the total), in under 10 hours. But it was a blast the whole way through. I was brimming with so much nostalgia it gave me goosebumps at times.If you liked the game when it was originally released, I can't recommend it more (at time of writing, it's even on sale!). If you're looking for a laid-back classic platformer, look no further. If you want to gallivant across a fictional Australia through worlds full of spirit filled with characters full of, well, character, then it doesn't get much better than this.You don't get the single highest user satisfaction rating on Steam by making a bad game. Both the game itself and the quality of the port are absolutely outstanding, and the developers should be (and probably are) very proud of their work. Never before has the Internet laid eyes upon such a labor of love."

It's a blast and better than it was when i first played it those many years ago.I've completed the game to 100%. So and i didn't experience any crashes, missing items or anything. The only thing that i did notice with this game was that a few spots you lost a bit of framerate in. Otherwise, the game is great, controls have been perfectly ported and binded for PC, they've added neat features like being able to fight bosses again without having to restart the game and of course upped the graphics of the game.It's hard to say wherther this game would fit someone right now with all games these days being much scavange survival, building and First person shooters. But for a nostalgic value or simply if you're someone who enjoys classic platformer games where you collect stuff. This game is gold.I don't know if you should get it now though, since they do warn you that since they are keeping the game in early access to get feedback on functions that are broken and trying to optimize the game further, there is a chance that save files can be corrupted from updates that are made. And i don't think anyone would like spending hours on maps collecting everything only to have their save file lost and have to restart the game.I played this game so much when i was a kid that i know practically everything by heart. So it didn't take me long to complete the whole game. But i'd say. If you've never played this game but want to experience classic old platformers in the style of Banjo and Kazooie then get this game the second it's out of early access. It's well worth it."

I like to think that Ty was a great role model for me when I was younger.I had nothing BUT Ty, and we hung out together all the time; even warranting further playthoughs because I had the time. No one understood why I loved Ty so much, and some people are just now hearing about him. I personally think it's rather shameful. As with a LOT of underrated games that I enjoy to the fullest, Ty was one of them. But little did I realize that he was more popular than I led myself to believe, as with how I see all these people here on Steam who do, in fact, love him. They love Krome Studios for holding onto the rights to Ty for so long, and with such little funds behind them. But later last year, they pushed out a fourth installmen to this series, and by golly, did people throw ther money at Krome. And with that money, they re-released this first indstallment, in HD.And again, by golly...<3It's all here—the core mechanics from the original release for Gamecube, PS2, and XBOX. Every level is the same, the overworld is the same. Every thing at all is the same, but that's DEFINITELY not a bad thing, as it's what the fans loved from before, and still do, and will forever.-------For new players, read here:The gameplay is by NO means lackluster, while it may be simple. It really is an easy 3D platformer with its own collection of...collectibles for you to find. A lot of them are really out in plain sight, but with a lot of those that are in plain sight, you'll sometimes need to get a certain 'rang' in order to gain access to it and grab it. And all of these collectibles help you out in the main game as well. You'll see~The game—assuming you're new—would probably last you about 5 or 6 or even 7 hours alone, and FULL completion can take you as long as you'd like it to.I won't say anything about the story, because if you're one of those who is just now learning how loved this series is, it's best to let you experience it for yourself, completely blind, if you're up for it.Yes, this is Early Access right now, and there are minor—I repeat, MINOR—errors in the game. No real bugs, or anything truly game-breaking, as the game has only needed to be rewritten in every regard. And as with Early Access, you would encounter these should you purchase the game, and your interest turns to adoration (though you might not appreciate the game as much as all of us prior fans do.) But Krome is VERY responsive ALL over the place: Facebook, Twitter, in the Steam discussions... Everywhere. None of your input will be missed, whether it be helpful input from this Early Access period, or just admiration for this game and how amazing in every way it is.I agree—the price is a bit much if you're just jumping onto the bandwagon, and also assuming you have neither of the games that would give you a small discout; and even with the early access discount, too. But again, going back to how I started this off:Us fans will GLADLY give Krome our money in hopes that they regain financial stability to become as great as they were before, and it's just so cool that they're still here<3"

Jak and Daxter, Grand Theft Auto Vice City, Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, Seek & Destroy, etfc. I played many, many games in my time. But this game personally takes the cake as my all time favorite game from my childhood. Sure, it's outdated. Sure, there isn't much real plot and the gameplay isn't spectacular. But it's still an amazing game nontheless. The uniqueness of playing as a sole surviving Tasmanian Tiger throwing boomerangs in the great Down Under really stands out against games that all seem to involve one thing nowadays; guns and war. This game gives a feeling of actual meaning to your actions, if you watch and listen to the little plot there is. You are trying to save your family from the Dreamtime, where the evil Boss Cass imprisoned them. Every Thunder Egg you collect makes you feel one step closer to acquaring a talisman, which is what is absolutely necessary in the task of freeing your family. Collecting every item is not necessary to beat the game, but it does unlock a nice bonus that I will not spoil. If you're beaten the game 100% on the PS2, Gamecube, or XBOX. And for all the veteren players, there's a VERY special surprise for you after you have beaten the game 100%, too. Trust me, you will LOVE it. The Steam version comes with various new features, such as the ability to replay bosses, map your controls, camera-oriented throwing instead of in front of TY, leaderboard support for time attacks, and the special surprise I mentioned above. Since it is still in Alpha, many things can be added or removed. I personally hope there is some sort of player vs. player time attacks where you can race against each other in real time. Maybe even add in new bosses that can be taken on with two players. This game IS worth the money. I was going to buy a game I had wanted for MONTHS, but then I saw this game on Steam and I HAD to buy it. It is my childhood.TL;DR - Awesome, fun, amazing source of nostalgia, happiness, childhood memories, new features, awesome secretsThe only cons I can think of are the ocasionally wonky camera angles, and the fact that it crashes often. You can play a full level 100% through, but it will likely crash on the next one.All in all, I rate this remaster a solid 9.8/10. The only reason it is not a 10/10 is because of the crashes. I can't wait to see the end result of this masterpiece!P.S. If you DO get it, go to Extras and check out the ""HD Test"", or something like that. Trust me, you will like it in one way or another."

Really nails the self referential meta hijinks without beating a dead horse like the cheeky little bat in Yooka Laylee.  Never even once have I played this game and felt distracted by poor mechanics like those in much more anticipated titles such as Yooka Laylee.Bottom line, it's a great 3d platformer that brings almost nothing new to the table but may be one of the most polished and well designed games to grace the genre. Also it comes at a fraction of the price of Yooka Laylee while boasting vastly more content."

That's a good price. It's a complete game in Early Access. You can play from the beginning hub world all the way through to the final boss and bonuses. The game has many objects to collect and a solid variety of enemies to fight. The remaster is shaping up well. Although I encountered minor graphical glitches and some low frame-rates at certain points in the game, it was overall a smooth experience. I expect perfmormance to be improved as development progresses closer to release. I did not encounter any crashes or game-breaking bugs. The only inconvenience was having to reload a couple of levels to make a couple of collectibles spawn properly, but the menus and loading times were responsive and quick. Colors are vibrant, and it looks pretty good at 1080p. The soundtrack is solid. I found the dialogue and voice acting to be very charming and Australian. I played with an Xbox 360 wired gamepad. Controls felt natural and easy to use. My criticisms are few. The game can be too easy now that most of us returning fans are older, and the level designs / aesthetics are a bit repetitive. Still, I enjoyed my playthrough. Clearly worth $12. Looking forward to T2.What did I play: Entire game. 100% game save with only two achievements left to unlock (I don't want to purposely die to run out of lives).And yes, nostalgia."

I can't believe I missed out on this early access of Ty having a HD remaster on PC in Steam. While the Xbox ports were the best, the PC outshines all the ports!

Those who played those games will also enjoy Ty the Tasmanian Tiger series since it was remastered for the first time, which was needed for a long time.The Ty series were hard to access due to being on legacy six generation of home video game consoles: PS2, Xbox, and GC at that time. Each and every year, the games are becoming more rare and harder to find in physical hard copies in great condition. But, I am a proud owner of the original Ty trilogy on the original Xbox in mint condition. Because I still love the original Xbox and still play the console along with the exclusives, I've a decent collection of Xbox games with most that will never be released on PC or remastered to the current generation of consoles.Play as Ty and help his friends out to defeat the evil Boss Cass who threatens his Australia outback home!The original ports of the game have bugs and some annoying things, but they're going to be fixed on this release.I do hope the Ty series will be released for the PS4 and Xbox One as three games in one!

Ty has really fun controls, and neat abilities, which is key to an enjoyable platforming game. The characters are well voiced, the graphics are beautiful, the levels are very well designed, and I have to play a level through multiple times to find everything because of how well they are made.

Most of the reviews I read here are through a lens of nostalgia ""I played this as a kid and enjoyed it then, so its good now.""  I did NOT play Ty as a kid, so my review is unbiased from a nostalgia perspective, and is purely based on the game I see now in 2016. I have no idea why the devs are calling this early access.

It's exactly how I remember it, except for some new great looking textures. The game itself is a fun lighthearted 3D platformer, lots to do, great level variation and fun platforming. Each level is completely different and offers some brilliant music along with interesting strange characters.There is a sense of accomplishement from collecting the little collectibles hidden in the map, you can obtain multiple new boomerangs from these collectibles. The game looks beautiful with so many colors and interesting enviroments. The voice acting is not the best, but what can you really expect from a 15 year old game with a reasonably low budget. I have noticed a few issues here and there. In the very first cutscene the audio gets really out of sync with the video towards the end of it. Sometimes the camera will just lose Ty completely, but only for a couple of seconds, this usually happens when getting out of the water. I haven't really noticed too many techincal issues other than a very few amount of frame drops, and they weren't too big either.I would absolutely reccomend picking this game up, and if its your first time playing it, I envy you.In its current state, I would give this game a 9.5/10. Other than a few minor techincal issues, there is nothing wrong with this game.EDIT: I have to give a whole lot of respect to the devs who are trying to pin down every single issue that people are having, good on you Krome Studios.EDIT 2: There have been many subtle upgrades since my last update, they have really enhanced the performance and made it look much better.

I thought this was just me, but nope, other people have this issue as well. Bad for those who actually enjoy the cutscenes.-------------------------------------I still like the game even with the issues. The camera only gets annoying to me when in tight spaces and the lag I am willing to pull through at the moment. I have enjoyed the game in the moments it has not lagged and played perfectly fine.If you are a fan of this game, get it, it has both keyboard and controller controls to fit your fancy.I have heard that the price WILL go up once it is out fo early-beta so there is an early warning for those with tight pockets but are a fan of the series.The game may have FPS issues, however mine seemed to have fixed itself once I turned reflection/shadow to OFF, making the game run perfectly fine & smooth.Note: My review will change as the game updates with anything that makes it worst or better."

PLUS it is in Early Acces atm so it will improve over time.Graphics:8/10Ofcourse this is still sort of in the making as they do intend do perhaps some repainting here and there. However as they already said, kinda everything has been has been already upped to the max using new lighting, shadows and draw distances so quality wise it wont improve to much anymore.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=651891571As you can see, they combined the 2 things to create the best thing they could possibly have created.At one hand the objects themselves are extremely nostalgic to old platformers. Simple shapes, smooth surfaces and just simple looks that make up a graphical theme that just fits these games. Replacing objects with more detailed realistic objects created with newer technology would ruin the entire vibe behind the game for sure.One thing that did lack at older games due to limited creationspace (both as in memory as in performance on devices) were shadows, shaders and lighting... those never go priority over gameplay and content, which is nice. But with nowadays machinery its possible to add so much more.. and they did.The lighting is great and adds alot more athmosphere to certain maps that have improved so much due to the added gloom and bloom :Phttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=651941070Old combines with new.. and it ends up being.. not bad at all :DAnti-aliasing atm isnt in so kinda can be forced through nvidia panel if you have an nvidia gpu. But its on the developers list of things they are looking at so.. hopefull :PGameplay:9/10Not even sure what to say about this.The jumping goes surprisingly alot easier than most platformer ports ive played, trowing boomerangs is fun, finding collectibles is fun and doing minigames is fun. What more to say?Just a great old combination of platforming, some action combat and a few puzzles/minigames now and then.Combine all older platformers/actiongams together in your mind, combine that with the trailer here on the Steampage and voila, thats it. Brings back so much casual laidback feelings.This game relaxes me so much when playing.Performance ..8.5/10The game runs great (unlike some ports ive played for sure) .. for more information check the forums for confirmation about this. But also for anyone running specs below mine (which isnt to high anymore nowadays -_-) within a week they will bring out a performance patch that minimizes the size of graphics alot (while maintaining the same quality ofc.) meaning both gpu's as well as processors have to load and render in alot less data meaning better fps! :DControl recommendation!I cannot say how well keyboard works. Ive heard people who were fine with keyboard, however .. its an old console game.. its simply made for controller :D So thats my recommendation... just play 3d platformers/actiongames with a controller :PNow... because its both a port and early acces i will give 3 scores here.. the text will speak for themselves:The game fully knowing it will only differ from the original in control smoothness and graphical fidelity ... 10/10The game for someone who never even knew Ty, but expects a 3d actionplatformer from the playstation 2 era ... 9/10The game for someone who expects a new-release action-platformer ... 6.5-7/10There you go... even someone who was looking for this genre but aside from that wants something 180 degree the other way, my guess would be he/she would still give it almost a 7 out of 10, thats how amazing i find this port :D"

Now, I'm not going to pretend that in it's current form it is great, parts are almost unplayable, the audio is off, but the devs at Krome Studios are clearly working on its compatability, and each time I check to see the updates on the game it is more and more optimised.My positive rating is based on the potential for this game to be great. I know I enjoyed the story thoroughly when I was younger, and I'm sure I will still do this now. However I would advise waiting to purchase the game because in it's current format it has some issues. However I'm sure over time the flaws will be ironed out and I can enjoy the nostalgia of playing one of my favourite games remastered on the PC.________________________________________________________________________________Edit: Currently the game runs at a much more smooth level of FPS, and has currently added the feature allowing the game to be compatible in loading screens with the mouse. Since my initial review a large number of improvements has been continously made towards this game, so much so that I would say that the game was easily playable and enjoyable in the current state.

Many times my rig could only push 60fps out of it. However it never dipped below that.-There are quite a few small but noticable visual bugs, mostly from the UI and the Opals.-Sound design. I can't quite remember if these are quirks from the PS2 and Gamecube releases, but there are several noticable sound problems. Such as moving characters not having their voice 'follow' them and several things not making noise that definately should. Such as Boss Cass' giant mech, or the huge mechanical gates leading to him being completely silent as they opened. Not a big issue tbh but I still noticed it.-Biggest issue here, a bug prevented me from completing the Frill Boat Battle and getting 100%.

It always surprised me how lukewarm the critics were towards it (most dismissed it as a soulless, but serviceable Mario or Banjo-Kazooie clone). Nothing could be farther from the truth than that.Pros:+Unique, almost comforting atmosphere. This game is beautiful. No other way to say it. The levels/environments you explore are varied and detailed. ranging from the Outback desert, quiet rainforests, the Great Barrier Reef (probably my favorite), snowy mountains, etc.+Phenomenal soundtrack helps set the mood for each environment and is jam-packed with catchy, memorable, relaxing, intense, and even uplifting tunes (it's that good).+Boss fights are intense, creative, and challenging.+Gameplay can be addicting. Think of it as something like Donkey Kong 64, only much more streamlined and less tedious. It's an adventure platformer with collectathon elements. The large, beautiful environments really inspire you to go exploring.+Great controls.+Balanced difficulty. It's just challenging enough to avoid feeling like a cakewalk.Cons:-Some of the more hardcore players might find it too easy.Port quality: Really nice so far. The visuals benefit from a nice upgrade, with improved resolution, a maxed out draw distance (climb to the tallest point in the level Ship Rex and you'll see what I mean), a silky smooth framerate (locked 60 FPS), improved shadow effects, better use of color, and more to come. Very responsive controls too. The game feels vastly more playable and comfortable on PC than the original PS2  outing. The only cons so far are a few very minor frame drops (and stuttering) in some levels as well as brief graphical glitches here and there. Also, it would be really nice to see some more improvement on the textures as they look almost identical to the PS2 version (albeit with a higher resolution). Also, the cutscenes are locked at a somewhat choppy 30 FPS for some reason. Can't wait to see how the finised product will look and feel, seeing as the devs are constantly updating the game to fix any bugs or glitches (as well as improve the graphics further).Overall: Worth a purchase. Probably the best 3D adventure platformer out on Steam at the moment and what looks to be a terrific port of an awesome game from days gone by."
,Recommended,411960,25505802,"Posted: 14 September, 2016",all,★ Mr Trillson ★,"An opinionated review for a childhood gem.Gameplay: Ty the Tasmanian Tiger is a platform adventure game where the goal of each level is to find all the collectibles. This includes Opals, Golden Cogs(Which unlock boomerangs),Bilbies, and the lesser known portraits which if all are collected unlock a movie. If you 100% the game you will unlock a secret level. The game is easy as it's meant for kids but it still has many fun mechanics such as how the boomerangs interact with the enviroment. The combat consists of throwing 'rangs or biting your foes.Art: The game is old but it has an artistic charm and the new fancy effects of this remastered edition help bring it up to speed. What more can you expect? It's an old game meant to run on Xbox, Ps2, and Gamecube. As for as graphic fidelity, the devs are doing a splendid job updating it regularly with little tweaks here and there. Although they could replace textures to enhance it even more but it is fine.Music: Best soundtrack for a kid's game I have ever heard. This game nails the Australian theme by adding tunes that use authentic Australian instruments(or emulates them) that make each level a joy to play on. Plus the Australian accents on the characters is cheesy in a good way.Entertainment: You will 100% this game and be done with it maybe only returning for funsies or to compete in the leaderboards to see who can complete each level the fastest.Score: The nostalgia goggles are off. Ty is a kid's game that succeeds by giving an experience that is not totally braindead but charming and memorable. It is my favorite game from my own childhood near Crash,Ratchet,Spyro and Jak. It deserves to be listed there. The port is damned good too. Ty 2 and 3 will be an insta-buy for me.4/5""YOU BEAUTY!"""

Now I can look for it again and hopefully actually find it and get that semi final boomerang.It works great.

I only completed the tutorial level 100%, but this game deserves some love right away:This was one of my first PS2 games as a kid, and I remember playing this for hours on end on weekends. The Steam port is very well done, so well done in fact that the transition almost seems fluid as it has perfect Xbox controller support (Haven't tried the keyboard/mouse controls yet). There are a couple audio glitches here and there, but part of me thinks they might be somewhat intentional, so that could just be me. Despite the graphics obviously being outdated, the game still looks gorgeous in my eyes as I'm truly excited the developers took the time to port this game to fit onto PC just as well as it played on PS2.I look forward to completing this game (again), but taking my sweet time as I ignored all the cinematics as a kid since I wanted to get in on the action right away. $10 asking price on launch day? Heck yes! This game's well worth that, if not a little more  (If you're playing from nostalgia). Some might complain the game looks old and isn't very thrilling or demanding, and may claim it's only worth $5, but I reject that way of thinking as this game still holds plenty of entertainment value to me.Thank you so much for porting this over, devs! $10 well spent, no regrets whatsoever."

Well, despite that, the game is running at 60FPS without problem on 3GB ram, 512MB Video, AMD Athlon processor. Its a cheap 2012 laptop. I bought it because I wanted to donate to Krome, for all the hard work they've done with Ty in the last few years. Krome actually cares about Ty and its fans, which same cannot be said about Spyro, Crash, Croc, Bubsy, Gex, the list goes on...This release is an HD port of Ty The Tasmanian Tiger for PC. Its a really good port in many aspects; visuals, sounds, gameplay. The keyboard controls are actually very well done. The visuals look great, and the sounds are nice. Its also nice to see Krome didn't replace any voice overs! Lately many game remasters change the voice overs because the original voice actor refuses to allow their voice in the game. Well, thankfully, Ty is still the same Ty! :)I made a video about my first impressions as well:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXKPyaZbEN4You should totally buy Ty HD! If you love the Ty Series, Krome, or even just miss classic well done and well developed platformers like Spyro, Crash, Croc, Gex, Etc, BUY THIS and support them! Right now its only 9.95.

The game is as great as I remember it being, and then some truthfully. Although Ty the Tasmanian Tiger appears as though it is a derived collectathon clone, a la Super Mario 64 and others, it offers a firm foundation of what has already been set in stone while adding in its own flavor well enough to make things interesting. One point that the game prides itself on, is the fact that you are Australian among other things, and you love your boomerangs. Throughout the game, you will receive a plethora of interesting boomerangs to up your arsenal and they are well implemented. The game isn't too long to simply never be beaten, especially for someone with a short attention span as I beat it 100%, besides picture frames, in around ten hours of playtime, yet those hours are never squandered. The graphics look incredibly similar to the original graphics of the PS2, but the remastering of the graphics and environment  is quite clear, with lighting wrapping around the trees onto Ty among other things. Music in this game is interesting to say the least to anyone who isn't familiar, combining easy-listening with aboriginal with drum and bass depending on the level and context of the situations you find yourself in. Overall, the quality is certainly there in the very early version of this remastered port, but I can't finish without touching on the single minor issue I had. Camera positioning is vital in 3D platformers and in the original, the camera worked incredibly well. The camera in this port does as well, but it infrequently gets caught on terrain when exiting water, but that never seemed to affect my playthrough more than make me repeat a race for an Egg at most.Pros:*Good stylized graphics, now with more polish and detail.*Great and original music*Interesting level design*Great voice acting*Comedically well-writtenMileage may vary:*Short, but long enough to be a ride.Cons:*Still EA so there might be bugs (such as my camera one)*There's nothing else to write about this great game.Would I recommend this: Yes. I'd even buy this remaster in it's current state at twenty dollars for its quality. I hope that the sales work well to get Ty 2 and 3 on Steam as well.

I tried going back to the ps2 and playing it but apperently back in those days the camera was inverted and I had completely forgot and on the old version there was no way to change it, also the graphics were meh but that was acceptable way back then. Playing this game in 60fps makes the game so beautiful. I see a few people complain about the camera angles but they obviously haven't played the original because the devs improved them a lot. Only bug I've seen in about 25% off my play through is that on Walk in The Park in order to get to the Opal collecting machine you must pass an obstacle that is alternating spikes on the ground and it almost seems like the hit box is WAY higher than it should be. I took damage when the spikes were down. If memory serves though this was a problem in the original.. Consider fixing though because if you are one hit from a death this can be very annoying!

Suppose I'll give my opions on everything then.Well as far as the HD part goes, I really can't argue with it. It's a very pretty game in comparison to the old versions. I love the water texture personally and the shadows are actually really well done. The controls for Ty's movement are actually really nice. Something about the feel ""faster"" for lack of a better word, but I actually really like it. Preformance wise, I was really happy. For the most part my fps stayed at 60 but occasionally dropped to 30 or 40 for seemingly no reason. It was never really an issue though as it never went below 30 and even when it did go that low it very quickly went back up. I probably wouldn't even have noticed only for the steam fps counter.Starting up the game's story, the cutscenes look the same as the old versions which takes away from the HD part of game completely. For some reason I can't move the camera when Ty is mid-air for some reason. I'm able to do that in the old versions so I really can't understand why I can't do it here. The last negative thing I would say here is only annoying more than anything. Whenever I get an item like a thunder egg or golden cog, the tune for getting them plays along with the main music of the stage. In the old version the music stopped to let the tune play and then resumed. As I said it's just annoying, not game breaking by any means. Also I did notice that it really doesn't like alt-tab at all which can be very annoying if I want to do something else while the game is running.There's also a few things I noticed that I wouldn't even call complaints and I honestly don't care if they ever get fixed I just want to point them out really. The first is the the Bilbies picture has a floating nose for some reason. This next one's weird. Every time I get a life it goes up to the number on the top left of the screen and the number has an invisible box around it that covers part of the life as it's getting added. The last thing I'd say here is that the game has the same glitch that Super Mario 64 had with the water life bar. If I take damage on land, I can go into water and the life bar will switch from the normal one to the water one. Then if I go back out of the water the normal life counter will be full again. I'm not sure if this was in the original games or not. If it was I never noticed it. Anyway, like I said these three are just tiny quirks and I really wouldn't mind if they weren't fixed. All other negatives however should really be looked into.In conclusion, I really like this version of the game. My only major issues I would say are the cuscenes and not being able to move the camera around while in mid-air. I am giving this a positive review because at early access this game is of very good quality.Thanks."

Ty is a Gamecube/Playstation 2/Xbox generation 3D platformer in the exploration/collect-a-thon spirit of games like Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie. If you played and enjoyed Banjo-Kazooie growing up, you can expect similar things from Ty. Great gameplay, smart level design, loveable characters, an amazing soundtrack, and an overall good time. I will admit to viewing the game with nostalgia glasses, but in the end the fact that I can go back to it all these years later and still have fun playing it shows that at some level, the game still holds up well today. Especially since there are too few great 3D platformers of it's type."

Keep in mind, it did originally come out in 2002, so some mechanics might feel slightly outdated, but otherwise, this game still holds a huge place in my heart as one of the best platformers to come out after the pinnacle that was Banjo Kazooie.Not to mention they did a pretty great job porting it over to PC.

,Recommended,411960,21983427,"Posted: 22 March, 2016",all,Yotomoco,"This is my favourite game of ALL TIME. So I know the game inside out and so can pick out a few things that are definitely different and not in a good way. Firstly with the intro sequence showing the background to the story, the audio is all out of sync. Secondly, as soon as you get into the game at Rainbow Cliffs the game runs EXTREMELY slowly, this seems to happen throughout the game so far (I've played through 2up, Ship Rex and Walk in the Park) but mostly in Rainbow Cliffs. It's not too much of a problem in the other levels however in Rainbow Cliffs when I first opened the game I almost concluded the game was unplayable. It seems to be certain areas in the other levels that trigger it to run slowly for instance, in 2up it runs slowly until you reach the first two of Cass' henchmen at the waterfall and then runs fine after that area. Another problem I encountered was the camera. If you're near a wall it will tend to ""freak out"" and you can't see at all what you're doing and trying to move the camera to a place where you can see is near impossible. The only way to fix it is to move TY himself away from the area that is causing the camera to stop working. Another small problem which I'm only picking up on because I love the game is that when you collect a thunder egg/golden cogg/bilby the music in the background continues to play over the tune that plays when you collect it. The audio in ""Walk in the Park"" is also not too great as sometimes the sound of the rain/waterfalls can be too loud to hear what any of the characters are saying.The quality of the models and environment are beautiful and is a definite improvement from the xbox/playstation games. The controls work for the PC very well. However, I realise this is an early access to the game, I really hope that the speed that the game runs at can be fixed as it is the biggest problem and really impacts the gameplay so far."

Very good 9 levels full of collectibles like banjo kazzoie with diffrent missions. Not much of a story but gameplay is fun character upgrades in the form of Boomerangs. Fun characters all over none are really forgettable (apart from weak main antagonist). Havent finished 100 percent but i am hoping for the sequels to be released for pc as i have never played them.

The game feels exactly like it did when it first came out.I have just completed the first world.1)The controls work great(I am using a wired abox 360 controller) so I have had no trouble so far.2)Everything looks perfect no visual or audio bugs so far.One issue I have had is with alt tab when in full screen. When I do it the screen will stay on the game but I am still able to click and alter things on my desktop. The game just obscures it. Im able to fix it with a ctrl alt delete. Then I can tab back into the game no problem.(This may be my systems problem not the game).

To see it being ported over to the PC is a great thing to see. It may not be as awesome as I remember it, with some levels later in the game that are huge but empty (Ex: Snow worries having a barren mountain to climb and Rex marks the spot has an empty ocean that really doesn't effect anything besides the time it takes to get from point A to point B) and that makes collecting everything a pain. The game still has some solid platforming. If you bought this game in the early 2000s, buy it here. The keyboard controls have been well intergrated so no gamepad is needed.The graphics (While dated in some parts) still hold up with the cartoony artstyle. And even with the over sized levels in the later stages, the levels are really fun to play and collect items to get new boomerangs. The game's greatest strengh is the Outback setting that's rare to see in games. This give the game an identity The only thing I 100% hate in this game is the characters. Ty is a cardboard cutout of a boy scout and picks one out of the same three lines when finishing a mission, Sly (Not the racoon) is the ultamate edgelord made from the mind of a 13 year old and comes off as annoying, and all the other characters as well as the bosses are completely forgetable.Overall it is a good game. I'd say the only thing that's holding it back is the developers and being in early access. I feel like the developers won't add anything major to the game or provide any real overhalls that can benefit the game at the cost of nostalgia from the fans. Also I'm willing to bet that a lot of Ty fans won't buy this game because it says it's in early access. The game is finished, you can play it from start to finish just as it was in the Ps2, gamecube, and Xbox. It's in early access for patching the game and porting it.I want you to buy this game, not only to get a good game but to also support the devs so that they can maybe port Ty 2 to PC. And I may be getting ahead of myself here but along with the release of Yooka-Laylee, this can encorage publishers to belive in 3D platformers again and more will appear on Steam."

I have no idea where it is though. I eventually found out it was on Steam from a comment on a youtube video of someone else playing. I was hesitant to buy it when I saw it was early access but after reading other reviews I decided  I might as well. I only found one problem which doesn't really matter as it doesn't limit the gameplay in any way but there is a grey square around the zoomarang when I throw it. The other rangs are fine though and this is possibly only a problem with my game as no other reviews I have read mention it.

Fans of collectable based games will feel right at home, since this game is based around collectable items to help progress story, and also unlock many extras, one such helping you increase your boomerang arsenal to take down the baddies. All in all, the game stays true to being a platformer at heart, and with plenty of lovely Australian scenery to take in. In one level you can be trudging through a dense rainforest, and then the next you could be riding through the wide open outback, or exploring a billabong.Fans of platforming games such as Rayman, Mario, Sonic, Crash Bandicoot and other iconic characters will love to give this game a go. With the current modest price of 12 dollars, it is a steal given you have plenty of packed to the brim levels, an amazing cast of characters, and most of all a development team that is here to make a game that everyone can love. Not to mention the game has enough content that even kept me busy for over 9 hours of gameplay to get that 100%, and that is with years of experience and knowing exactly how to play from start to finish."

However that didn´t stop me from fully enjoying the game, it´s very simplistic and someone that don´t even play video games on a regular basis can play this game with no problems.The Story:This story takes place in Australia and you play as a Tasmanian tiger called Ty. Ty´s family has been trapped in the spirit world by the evil Boss Cass (The Main Villain of the story). It is now up to Ty to save his family and friends from Boss Cass who wants power from the ancient Talismans that trapped Ty´s family in the spirit world. You will be travelling across multiple different enviroments of Australia to find them including the forests, the outback and the great barrier reef. Along the way you will be facing Boss Cass´ goons that include kangaroos, frill lizards and blue tongue lizards as well as mini bosses like a bull, a cyborg shark and a massive mountain monster.The Gameplay:The gameplay isn´t too advanced. Combat consists of you throwing boomerangs and techno boomerangs at foes as well as biting them. You will also be gliding, swiming and jumping a lot since the game is a 3D platformer after all. In each level there are different tasks that include finding and saving your friends, collecting all opals and collecting all golden cogs that will unlock technorangs. Each level all have a main quest that can be something like escorting someone to safety, finding lost children or finding someone of interest.The characters:Ty: Ty is the main character and he is the typical hero and doesn´t really have to much to say but still have a rich personality and is very ""Australian""Maurie: Maurie is your guide throughout the game. He tells a lot of jokes and introduces you to each level and gives you a general idea of what you´ll be facing in the levels.Julius: Julius is a tech genius and is the character that allows you to travel to different levels and gives you the technorangs if you collect enough golden cogs.Boss Cass: Boss Cass is the antagonist of the game and uses his minions to fight you. He doesn´t have a lot of depth besides that he wants the talismans to elliminate the tasmanian tigers.The design:This game has incredible design. The atmosphere is incredible and you feel like you´re in Australia and the music only solidifies this. The graphics have a special charm that you will find in other games from that time as well. I had no performance issues with the game and it ran smoothly. I also did not encounter any bugs or glitches so kudos to Krome Studios.Generally this is the game that i remember from my childhood and i am so thankful that they managed to bring the magic of the game over to PC from Consoles."

I remember playing this back on the gamecube when it first came out and absolutely loving it. Playing through it now, I can see a few issues that I may not have noticed back when I was younger but overall this is still one of my favorite platformer games I've played. I have to say I am kind of surprised how well this game holds up, but its music, art, and gameplay all manage to still captivate me. The music especially so. Once I heard the first level's theme I was instantly transported back in time to when I first played this game. On the negative side, there are a few slow downs and audio desyncs here and there, but I would attribute that to it being an early access game. Hopefully by the time the game is fully out these issues will be fixed. As well, there are a few relics of its time that still cling to this port such as low res cutscenes and an occasionally wonky camera. As well, this game can be a bit on the easy side. Overall however, the pros vastly outweigh the minor cons that I pointed out. This is one of my favorites of the 3D Collect-a-thon subgenre and if anyone has been wanting for such a game this is absolutely one I would have no issue reccommending. With some work for optimization, I can easily see this game as an 4/5. It's not perfect by any stretch, and the challenge mostly comes from collecting everything 100%. Regardless, I have been missing these types of games for a long time now and I'm really glad to see one of my favorites coming back on PC."

The game, though in alpha is definitely playable and enjoyable. Some of the visuals were bugging for me though everything else seemed to run smoothly. I had a blast for the bit that I played the game, the sounds especially brought waves of nostalgia rolling back. I am very excited to see this game be built and improved upon as well as the prospects for a Ty 2 and 3 remake. I just hope the team at Krome is able to get enough support to make all of this happen, pulling in new fans of a decade and a half old 3D platformer can't be easy.

So many games these days promise nostalgia but fail to deliver a fun or genuine experience, but Ty delivers on almost all fronts. This is largely due to it's 2002 roots, a much different age in gaming. I grew up playing Ty (and its subsequent sequels) and still fondly remember it. When I heard that it was being ressurected, I couldn't believe it.This port delivers, despite still being in Early Access. It stands up beyond nostalgia- offering a bright, fun and engrossing experience. Despite it releasing only a day or two ago, I couldn't help but play through and complete the entire game. However, the length of the game might be the title's biggest downfall; To complete the game at 100% (Which does NOT include the hidden art) it took me between 9 and 10 hours. While my playtime might have been influenced by prior knowledge, it's important to keep in mind.But for the price of about $9 to $12 it delivers a worthy experience. Make sure you have a gamepad before playing and enjoy the delightfully corny Australian experience Ty delivers.I look forward to the ports of the two subsequent 3D Ty games, and wish the best to the developers with bringing this classic mascot platformer franchise back."

The effects and graphics are definitley cleaner and more define than before. The controls are almost exactly the same as playstations configurations when using your steam controller.  If you loved this franchise when it came out than I definitley recommend it to you now.

But I ain't gonna lie, I mainly got this in hopes that they will also add the 2nd and 3rd game to the PC. Can't wait for that happen!Anyway, about this game. It is a bit of an old game, but older games normally tend to be fun, if not more fun than games from today. The story is rather simple, and though many know the story already, I will avoid spoilers. You play, as the title says, a tasmanian tiger named Ty. Ty explores many different terrains and weather in search for thunder eggs, golden cogs, opals, his bilby friends, and most importantly, talismans.Gameplay: The game offers about 4-6 hours of gameplay. You are given many different levels to explore, take what is available in each level, and progress. The difficulty of the game is rather easy, in all honesty, the most likely thing that will kill you is the stuff on water slides and fall damage. Most the bosses are rather easy to beat, but that doesn't say the bosses aren't a battle to forget.Characters: This game does have some memorable characters with some interesting personalities. Ty himself, in my opinion, didn't seem to be the most interesting character in my mind, but I will remember him only because he was the character you played as the whole time.Controls: I understand they are still working on improving the PC version of this game, but the controls at the moment are really sloppy. The camera oftenly got stuck, the sensitivity for me was pretty low, even after I turned it up, and movement, espacially around corners, felt real awkward and oftenly costed me while fighting or sliding. I have only used the keyboard and mouse. I can't say for controller.Graphics: Obviously, for an old game, this game kind of lacks textures and effects. But I will say that the lighting (for at its time of release) is really not bad. Though obviously, you should never judge a game by its graphics. 2D or 3DPrice: For 4-6 hours of gameplay, some replayability, and maybe a few memorable moments and characters. The price of 12 dollars isn't to bad. But if it ever is on sale, highly consider it.Rating: For people who played this back when it first released, it will be a trip down nostalgia lane. For people who are new to the game, it will prove to be a good experiance. For a price of 12 dollars, and all that I said above, I think it is a fair 6/10Make sure to support Krome Studios to help them improve this game and hopefully get Ty The Tasmanian Tiger 2 & 3 moved to PC!"

The level design, the music, the voice acting, the overall atmosphere of this game is phenomenal.The story of this game is a simple 3D platformer story, where ty's parents are sent to an alternate world and ty needs to rescue them by collecting 5 tallismans. Overall very simple, but this simple story allows for the gameplay to really shine as it was meant to. Imagine banjo kazooie, mixed with basic mario platforming from sunshine, combined with a unique take on fast paced ranged combat. THAT is Ty the tazmanian tiger, and its brought together really well. The rangs within the game allow for the player to challenge combat in whatever way they deem right. The game doesnt hold your hand either, and I still had challenges with obtaining some of the thunder eggs. The level design is mixed between open levels, where you can go anywhere. And linear levels, where the goal is to get thunder eggs as you go through the level. These mix really well with each other and allow the player to never get bored since all levels are unique. The water levels in general are amazing in this game, and allow for a ""taste"" of what an open world ty game would be like. The platforming it solid and smooth, allowing for brilliant maneuvers to be done that get the player where they want to go.Now in terms of bad things for the game, there are some glitches here and there, but thats to be expected of an early access title and it never BROKE the game so I forgot about them. In terms of story, it could have been more fleshed out, but this is a 3D platformer from the early 2000's and the gameplay makes you forget all about that. The character of Sly within the game felt kinda....eh now that I think about it. He implys certain things within his dialouge that is never actually fleshed out, which, if done correctly, could have been AMAZING. However these kinda story problems are fixed with later installments in the series such as ty 2 and ty 3, which I can say had some of the more interesting, serious stories of any 3D platformer i've played. This is ty 1 however so that can be annoying to anyone who nitpicks that stuff. Controls are being improved constantly and I've had the liberty to play this with the xbox one controller, the steam controller, and mouse and keyboard. The xbox controller is the most standard and probably the best one to use as of right now if you're not accustomed to the steam controller. IF YOU ARE however, the steam controller is the way to go as it allows precise aiming during Ty View. Keyboard and mouse is also ok, but that has some bugs that are still getting fixed.Honestly this game is worth the money JUST for the investment. Ty 2, was better than Ty 1, and I for one really want this game to succed to down the road I get 2, 3, and Ty 5. However on its own, I believe this game is an amazing title for any PC owner that wants change from their regular games, and wants to play a 3D platformer on PC."

It seems Jim Sterling has made early access for this game seem a terrible thing, but the devs actually care about their game and update it regularly. Unlike some other devs, but that's not what I'm here to talk about.What do you get with this game? A port of the original Ty game, with multiple improvements such as shadows, 60fps, upscaled textures, improved controls, and the list will hopefully grow as the game continues to be updated (which is always a plus in my book).Since I grew up with the Ty series (bar 3 since it had a very limited release in the UK) I had to check this out once it was released, and I was not disappointed. Although this may differ from other people's accounts, my playthrough was flawless and 100 percenting this game again was a blast.I hope Ty 2 is ported as well as this game was, since it was my favourite. I recommend this to fans of the series, and maybe even fans of classic collectathons like Banjo-Kazooie and Jak and Daxter. I rate the game 9/10 - A nostalgic blast from my past."

I firmly believe this game is worth buying, even in its early access state.

The graphical enhancements are fairly well done: Surface textures are still as you would expect from a 2002 game but the geometry scales well to modern resolutions. The cutscenes are still at the resolution that they were in 2002 (so they are fairly pixelated on my 1080p monitor) but that's a minor distruption in an otherwise amazing game!Edit 1: So after I 100%'ed the game (99% due to a bug), a hindsight view I have in terms of the actual gameplay is that when you unlock a new boomerang, especially in the later levels, you get less of a chance to use them to their full potential. For example the chronorang, which can only be unlocked after finding all (90) golden cogs, the only chance I had to use it was in Cass' Pass (even then it wasn't useful). One solution I can think to this is to involve the boomerangs more in the levels, by having puzzles/challanges that involve boomerangs in a certain way. For the later boomerangs, because not all players will want to collect everything to get them, why not have challenge levels that are unlocked after the final boss battle? Just an idea, but a brilliant game and a great remake."

If you want to get it in early access, you'll save some money and have a voice in helping the game reach it's completion, i.e. report bugs, suggest improvements... The devs are very involved and active, which makes any game better. It's great knowing the devs are actively listening and taking feedback.If you don't want to play a game in early access, then by all means wait and play it when it's done. Either way, I highly recommend giving this game a shot.I hope to see Ty 2 and 3 make it's way to steam, and maybe a full 3D Ty 5 in the future. That'd be amazing. :)"

Lots of things that constantly hit me right in the childhood.Positives:-I wasnt exactly afraid that this remaster would absolutly change everything, but I'm glad that you guys drastically improved things while still maintaining the art style the game has. It was an absolute nostalgia trip!-Some added effects that I dont recall seeing in the previous version of the game (the PS2 version at least) caught me off guard with the lighting on boomerangs such as Frostyrang and the Zappyrang which were really good. THE WATER!!-Resolution was handled really well. Didnt see much texture problems occur from running the game in 1920 × 1080 which is impressive. At points I stopped to take in the scenery because it looked so awesome.-Small things like the sound effect for completing/ obtaining new rangs were a nice addition and change from the old jingle, but I personally feel it could be changed into something more fitting maybe.-Eveything is obtainable (not sure about the picture frames). Didnt find any bugs with being unable to 100% a level due to a item not spawning or being unreachable.-Didnt experience any crashes, even when playing over a long period of time.-The game ran really well with my average PC. Snow levels in particular ran very well!Negatives:I didnt really find anything wrong with the game that doesnt classify as a minor bugs but...- The mission with the bombing boat Frills in Rex Marks The Spot it bugged to the point were you might not be able to complete it since the Frills that you defeat arent registered. However when I started the race mission it fixed it but interupted the race, causing me to lose the race.-Some missions like the snowball turrent mission felt cluncky to use with keyboard controls. Maybe the controls could be moved over to the mouse instead?-Some medium frame rate drops in some areas, which are more prevalent in the rainforest levels.-The draw distance in some areas make surrounding areas look a bit broken.- The shadows in some areas flicker on and off. Specifically In Beyond The Black Stump-Camera control take some getting used to.Overall I would definatly reccomend this game to anyone whos played the previous game as it is a great trip down memory lane and those who are curious too, as long as your not too put off by minor bugs."
,Recommended,411960,22102848,"Posted: 28 March, 2016",all,Fibre,"Not much of a reviewer so i'll keep it short and simple.This game is pretty damn spot on to the original with better looking textures, lighting and shadows. If you have played TY before, then this is definatly worth picking up. I'm not so sure for someone who had never played a game inthe series before however; this rerelease is more of a nostalgic trip down memory lane rather than trying to add more gameplay mechanics and features.Only found two downsides to this rerelease: - You get a massive LAG spike when walking by the gumtrees on your wayto the first 3 levels (although I beleive they've release a temparary patchwhile they find a perminant one. This will probably be fixed at a later date).-  I don't know if it's just for me, but during the cutscenes the audio andvideo becomes out of sync. The video seems to be playiong at about 25%than it should be. I'm not sure there's a fix for this yet, but as it is earlyaccess this will be something that'll be fixed quite quickly.So takling into account the early access and bugs, I would definatly recommend this game to anyone who has played a TY game before as you will not be disappointed by the upgrades the rerelease has made (not to mention the nostalgia you will feel).I do not however recommend this to anyone new; I feel that you may not think that it is as great as I seem to be making it out to be, because you do not share that nostalgic connection to the series."

So...does the game hold up?Well...yes, actually. If you can get passe dthe game's ""Australian Stereotypes: the game"" You'll find a platformer that doesn't really reinvent the wheel but boy does it polish the mechanics of it's genre to a mirror shine. TY controls great, and somehow even makes water and swimming portions FUN! I know colour me shocked someone  figured it out.The level design is also pretty open, giving you a lot of options on how get around and collect all the things. The game is still fairly nice to look at even for remaster of game from the early 2000s that (As of this review) is still being worked on. From what I played TY is surpsingly smooth, well crafted platformer that Krome is clearly very proud of to try and remaster, and I'd say that pride is warranted.The closest thing i can say to bad things is, again, the ""Australian"" theme is a bit of an aquired taste (though Krome is based out in Brisbane for what it's worth), the pre-rendered cutscenes look a bit murky on modern hardware (Something that for techicaly reasons can't really be helped but the in-engine stuff looks fine BTW) and for some reason the game's frame-rate is blisteringly fast which is a bit disconcretaing at first bug you get used to.If you're nostaglic for this game, or like me really miss this style of game that has become rare in 2016 I'd recommend TY The Tasmanian Tiger. It does so many things right within it's genre I actually want to play the sequels now and hope they get remasters too."

I wouldn't recommend this for 100% completionists because the placement of some of the opals (think coins from Mario) are really, horribly obscure and unsighposted, and you need to collect EVERY SINGLE ONE in order to get the corresponding thunder egg (Star/Jiggy). And leaving the level before collecting them all resets your collection. And there are 300, THREE HUNDRED, TROIS HUNDO, in each level. I once played through a level for about an hour trying to find the last 3, which were in a crate covered in snow on the side of a mountain with nothing else around it to make it an interesting area.

However, the models are still relatively low-poly in addition to the still very basic textures - lessening the general graphical quality.(For a mod which further improves Ty's graphics, look no further than(Ty graphical mod})~ Gameplay - 3/5 ~This game is one of very few decent 3d platformers on Steam, with some of the least janky platforming controls, apart fromthe gliding toward the end of the Lenny The Lyrebird stage. As well thereas, this game is one of the first and only of very few to successfully employ particle effects as a means of rewarding the player - granting a much more fulfilling experience. The controls are untweakable, which hinders accustomation with the clunky control scheme, and navigating on foot with Ty - in terms of game feel - is heavy and slow. Krome Studios missed out on many opportunities of mechanically deepening their game:-too many of the boomerangs serve no purpose; there are no boomerang-specific enemies; the game concludes too quickly; and overly repurposed assets dominate the game.~ Story - 2/4 ~The narrative - an archetypalfinding one's family""adventure"" - is severely lackluster and seems rather rushed, with much left unexplained. Characters tend to be rarely humorous and mostly annoying; and their incessantly bombarding use of Australian slang feels forced.~ Optimisation - 2/5 ~Indeed - the graphical settings are tweakable to suit your PC build, yet the advancement to Direct X11 highlights the poor ageing of the game's optimisation - the game obviously lacks textural RGB channel-packing and seems to lack any LODs. Adding thereto, TY appears illogically locked at 60 frames per second.~ Verdict - 5.5/10 ~Though an appreciated contribution to the 3d Platformer Renaissance, Ty emphasises the need for more effort to be put into 3d Platformers if their 2016 and -17 rebirth are to fulfill the heretofore unactualised predictions of market domination."

Unlike others that have hefty, slow, unresponsive controls, Ty does it right. The aiming, the movement, the jumping, every about this game makes it less about lining up or revving up movement, and more about just doing it. Compared to other platformers, the frustration level of missing a jump, or stutter-stepping around is just absent.If you loved Ty the first time, or want a brisk refreshing Australian style platformer, I can't reccomend this enough. Heck, just for the fabulous controls it's almost worth $5 in itself. If I could I'd prefer almost every platformer had controls like Ty, at least for the basics."

SO MANY MEMORIES!You have no idea how quickly I bought this game after I saw that they released it on steam.I am SOOOO glad you guys got around to porting it to PC as a HD remaster. it's impossible to find an original copy nowadays (and pricey too depending on where you look).The gameplay still holds up amazingly, although controls are a tad fidgety at this point in time, I can't seem to swap the mouse buttons as when I try to set Throw Boomerang to RMB it cancels the configuration. So probably work on that.But those are mostly things that will be cleared up as the port gets more refined.Also, if I may have one request for the developers. Could you please add the Doomerang as an end game unlock? like Ty still has it after the credits roll and you're placed back into the game? back in the day I was so disappointed that you were only able to use the Doomerang in the last level of the game.Anyways, This game is a huge collect-a-thon, so if that's not your thing, then probably give this game a pass. But if you never got the chance to play this game and love the simplicity of games like Crash Bandicoot or Banjo Kazooie, then this is perfect for you.

They just don't make games like this any more.Looks similar to the PS2 release with a higher resolution from what I can tell, however, you can now play at more than 30fps which is pretty great.For an alpha, it runs pretty good with just some hitching and a little bit of pop-in.The controls are surprisingly good with mouse and keyboard. Controls are what you would expect with a controller. However, the camera is pretty bad. Sometimes when TY is standing by a wall and you try to spin the camera it will just spaz out like crazy (at least with mouse and keyboard).Sounds haven't been improved it seems. Although the only thing that I think needs to be cleaned up is the voices. The crunch of TY's bite and the shattering of wooden boxes sound just as good as they ever did.Overall I'm pleased with the game and the price is not too high. Even though it is an old game, it offers more content and fun than any of the trash the ""AAA"" market has barfed up recently (things really were better back then).Good work Krome, but here are some improvements you could make:- NATIVE 21:9 SUPPORT- MORE GRAPHICS OPTIONS- ANTI-ALIASING- FIX POP-IN (MOSTLY SEEN ON SPIKED WOODEN POSTS)- STEAM TRADING CARDS"

Couple of things I've noticed right off the bat are significant FPS drops just from running around in Two Up, as well as the background music not cutting out when I collect a cog or free a bilby like it did in the original release. Additionally, sometimes the dialogue is out of sync with the animations.Also, controlling the camera is very difficult sometimes, as it feels like the accelleration is cranked way up proportionally to how I move the analog stick. I have the PS2 release with me and have compared, and it was like that in the original, but an option to adjust camera sensitivity would be nice.Finally, the mouse cursor does not dissappear when I am in-game and using the gamepad, and it appears that I cannot tab out easily.Still, these are just little things I've noticed so far, and since it is in Early Access, I figured I should chime in with those issues to make sure that they get fixed and help make this every bit as good as I remember it being!Moving on to the positives, the HD looks amazing, especially for such an older game, and the reflections are a sight to behold on the highest settings, Controls are tight and responsive, except for that little camera nitpick previously, and Ty controls beautifully. I can't wait to complete this game all over again, especially since my old PS2 copy is nearly worn out!I've not ventured past Two Up so far, so I'll be sure to edit this review with any other points of interest I come across.*EDIT* Okay, so I just finished Ship Rex, and I'm a little baffled by a few musical changes. For one, when I obtained the Zoomerang, it played an... odd, foreboding sort of jingle, as opposed to the carnival prize-ish sound of the original game. Secondly, when I raced Rex, the original music seems to have been replaced by a more vocal track. Those are the only two I have noticed, but I'm wondering why they were changed?Nothing much else to note other than the horrible lag, and occasionally the camera seems to get caught on objects in the world, such as the gate in Rainbow Cliffs."

,Recommended,411960,33613831,Posted: 17 July,all,Ezah,"TY the Tasmanian Tiger is one of those games that starts slow and grows on you. I never played it back in its original heyday with the other mascot games, but it does compare favorably to games such as Spyro the Dragon, Sly Cooper, and Jak and Daxter. There are nine environments, with one hub world and one boss world, with plenty of stuff to do that allows for exploration and decent combat and puzzle solving.The only 2 problems I had that were of any substance were1) TY literally only saying 1 liner catch phrases, with an occasional dumb question to progress the dialogue (seriously, every other character had some personality, while TY would be better off as Gordon Freeman), and2) seemingly random patches in the environment that you aren't supposed to enter, but can anyways. Going up on that snowy mountain? Hope you don't hit a patch of rock that isn't covered in snow, because you're about to go for a slip n slide ride!Otherwise, there was some minor stuff that is just pedantic, so I won't go over them. There is plenty of stuff to collect. You don't get punished a multitude of times for the same mistake (e.g. if you jump into a flamethrower, you take damage once and then either get knocked back to your starting position or keep going, with a short immunity, instead of getting knocked off a cliff and having to run all the way back). Most NPCs are interesting, the game doesn't unnecessarily drag on, and the boomerangs and their many varieties are integrated well enough that it is worth using most of the upgrades for a variety of situations.Overall, it's a solid mascot/3D action platformer from the PS2 era, a rarity on the steam platform. It doesn't have much to set it apart from other mascot games, other than an Australian theme, but there are very few if any major drawbacks. If you like Spyro, Sly Cooper, Crash, Jak and Daxter, etc etc this is a solid nostalgia trip but won't be anything terribly new. If you haven't, it's a solid entry that showcases what these types of games are about. I would give it a 7/10, great for on sale to try, or even good outside of a sale to scratch that mascot game itch."

The port is actually really good, I mean, I never played the original game, but it runs well on my modern gaming PC. The game is actually pretty fun, and I 100%'d the first few levels. I'm not saying you won't like the game, but I'm saying it's not for everyone. I personally liked the game, but found it to be repetitive in the later levels.If you're expecting anything more than a few hours of platforming fun, you're going to be disappointed. The bosses are mind-numbingly easy, the levels are cool but most of them are too similar, the core gameplay isn't really spectacular, it's okay. However, if you are nostalgic for this game in any capacity, you might as well pick it up. In fact, even if you aren't, it's still the highest rated game on Steam.Just buy it. If you don't like the first 30 minutes of the game, you won't like the rest of it, and you can just refund it."

The bosses are completly forgettable and boring, the camera could do with some work but they might fix that later in development. on the positive the platforming is decent, the swimming is decent (but the water levels are badly designed) and a lot of awesome boomerangs to play with (except the zaporang that you will use once and then never again unless you are achivement hunting) now that they turned the price down since i bought it its an good enough time to be an recommend from me and an easy pickup if you have the need for nostalgia"

I dont go though the effort of writing reviews for most game, but I feel like TY the Tasmainian TIger deserve one. I'm not going to review the gameplay, as the is is a game you're only going to play though nostiglia tinted-glasses, I'm not an exception to that. But I think the more important thing you can say about is point is how is the PC-Port? It was what I was spektial of when I bought the game. I have to say this is one of the best PC-port I have ever encounted, Its a shining example of why with a little actual effort to port the game to PC. Its the best of Early Access aswell, Looking though th epatch notes you see that the Krome 2016 cares and intersted in polishing the game. I'm a bit cynical about the game indusrty these days and I fully expected for this to be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port and mostly unplayable without a controller. But it was not that. I choose to play the game using a Keyboard/Mouse and I just enjoyed myself all away though, there was no need to use a controller! The option menu supports a robust amount of control options (I used default) and graphic options. Impressivly They add High res textures, Shadows, and View distance. So the game just naturally looks better to there consol counter-parts. The View Distance option is a must for anybody. I hope that other games can follow what Krome did here. Its beyond the pinnical of how to do Early Access and a PC-Port. Personially I kinda hope that the Krome 2016 team goes into producing more Ports of those classic game, I think they could be one of the top porting development teams."

They've so far showed devotion and hard work towards getting this game out of early access with the best quality they can manage. And there are some new extras that are a treat to old Ty fans.For those of you who haven't, this game is basically one of the old classic platformer collectathons of the past, but with cool, unique features like the boomerang weapon, which is very satisfying to throw and glide with. Not to mention some collectibles are actually really hard to find at times, so there adds and extra layer of challenge for treasure hunting.Speaking of difficult, I will admit this game wasn't too difficult so far, maybe that's just me having played this 12 years ago, or I've played many platformers. I'm more leaning towards the latter, so if you're crazy about platformer collectathons, expect Banjo Kazzoie levels of challenge from this game besides the ocassional speed-run challenge or wild turkey chase. But I will say the heart of this game is not for its difficulty but its diverse and somewhat open-ended levels. Just exploring the levels and finding all the things to collect while you glide, swim, look around corners and ditches and hige rooftops, it's quite fun.This PC port of the classic game has been optimized to work at the highest of framerates on the lowest graphic settings, trumping the PS2 in terms of performance. And the highest graphic settings add so much more detail and scenic beauty to the original, but is only recommended for high-end PC's.Overall, a must buy for fans of Ty, and a good pick for those looking for a good platformer collectathon while you wait for Yooka Laylee. ;)"

TY 1's gameplay and story are very limited compared to whay I remeber of TY 2(never played 3). It is still a fun game, but if you are going into it looking for deep story or gameplay, you won't find it here. I'd recommend this to anyone wanting to relive some childhood memories.There are some minor bugs, and preformance was mostly fine on my laptop(6700hq and 970m), but I think it could be better. Windowed and borderless windowed with custom resolution needs to be added for sure. And if possible, enhanced textures and models, most are fine, but some characters seem a bit buggy and needing of a faceift.Took me about 10 hours to beat the game with finding all thunder eggs, and golden cogs, and having 98% completion.

So it was a very welcome suprrise to see that the first is back (and that the 2nd and 3rd will be following along.)Positives:A+ Platformer: This is what alot of platformers should aspire to be what with how much fun it is, with its open world type enviroments and wide variety of enemies.Hours of fun: This game is a pretty big collect-a-thon, which can leave alot to do if you want to reach 100% progress and get all the acheivements.Acheivements: With this updated port comes a bunch of Steam Acheivements which is a very much welcome addition.Solid Build: For an early access game, its already very well done. It doesn't experience any gamebreaking issues like random crashes or whatever, its very easily playable without too much problem.Negatives:Repetitive: Honestly, the game can feel a tad samey after awhile. Alot of the tasks to get Thunder Eggs and whatnot are pretty much the same across each level, which can be a bit of a killer to deal with.FPS: The game seems to have rather large and unusual drops in FPS which can be a huge nuisance to deal with. It can in some cases cause the game to slow to a crawl which can really ruin the experience.Closing Remarks:The game is very well done so far. Whilst there is some work to be done, so far the game shows promise and I've full faith that Krome will deliver and polish this game to perfection. Got alot of hope for this game, and for ports of the next installments in the Ty series."

I can safely say I don't regret the purchase. This game was hugely nostalgic for me, and unlike most games from that era, it looks and plays better than I expected. The game does have issues with Intel GPU's, and I imagine it probably looks even better on AMD or Nvidia cards. As an early access, I can expect it to only get better from here, even though I'd say it's up to scratch as a perfectly good PC port of a PS2 game. Even on low to mid settings, it still looks great.

So many hours were spent looking around every corner in every world, finding collectionables and all that. The variation in boomerangs always managed to keep the game interesting every time you advanced further into it. The levels have beautiful landscapes and are very well designed, it's really hard not to check that last corner even if you've already got everything in the level.A solid port/remaster for a great, if anything underrated game from my childhood.I really hope to see more ports from the developers' games and I'm sure they'll do just as good, if not even better.

Basically, the only thing left to do, is to redo all texures and fix some of the hitboxes, which is easier said than done. It should take a lot of time and effort, and that's basically the my only reason to why I bought TY 4 (to support the development of the game, and eventually making it possible for them to port TY 2 to PC).So let's be honest, who plays this game for the plot or the incredible characters - I know that I don't.

The question on everyone's mind is, what's a Tasmanian Tiger? Is it even real? Is it like a Tasmanian Devil? Do we even care? Well I'm here to tell you without using too much of my sleuthing skills that yes, yes it is real. Well I think so at least. Below is a picture.I said it before and I'll say it again. Bit.... oops wrong thing. I welcome all games like Mario 64 with open arms now-a-days. Before you couldn't take two steps without one being flung at your head with a frisby like precision headed for your friend at just the right spot (near some good looking people). Now it's like a desert, a barren wasteland with almost none to be found. Poi was a welcome surprise, and next years Yooka-Laylee looks absolutely awesome, one to look out for, for sure. Let's get started.Ty the Tasmanian Tiger is a remastered version of the original Ty, which came out on the PlayStation 2 on September 10, 2002. I never played it then, but I feel like I'll appreciate it more, now. It's a colorful world with a bright cheery cast of characters. The controls were a little bit too touchy when I first started, but by the end of my short thirty minute play through ( one whole level) I came to get used to it.Ty has plenty of collectibles. The usual items that are thrown about the level like M64's coins, the more valued item that only appears once a few times, etc. A boomerang is the weapon of choice for Ty, it's a tiny bit annoying, emphasis on tiny, but annoying nonetheless. Why? because there is no lock on mechanic, you position your character towards the enemy and press the action button and it throws it. You can also switch to first person mode, for a more precise way of throwing the boomerang. Seeing as though it's a remaster I can't see why they couldn't add an auto-target feature.Unlike Mario 64 where there were worlds, Ty is more of the Crash Bandicoot level type, but not completely if that makes sense. I'll explain. Going through a level I noticed that there was a ledge that I could not get to, no matter how many times I tried. While playing through the level, new abilities were introduced, one that gave me the ability to glide. I went back to the unreachable ledge and happily glided to it and collected my coins. Another thing I've noticed is that there are items underwater but currently Ty can only splash about in a panic way when you try to dive. Further adventuring I was awarded a second boomerang. These are fun to throw weapons.I enjoyed my time with Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, and I hope to lash some faces with my boomerangs and get to my next entry soon. Thanks for reading.3.5/5""Nostalgic, yet still holds up"""

I was completely obsessed with it. Now it's time to find out, does it still hold up. I'm happy to say that even now I thoughrouly enjoyed this game. On my first playthrough with this new version I completed the game and got 100% of the collectibles. It took me nearly 20 hours but I did it. The gameplay for Ty consisits of fighting enemies and collecting items to help you move on to the next level. Ty can throw boomerangs and bite his way through enemies. I love the cheesy writing as well. None of it is cheesy to the point of annoyance just to the extent where you can laugh at it while still enjoying the experience. I did however find it really annoying trying to get all of the collectibles in the game. Some of them were in really sneaky hiding places which  T R I G G E R E D at some points. The story of the game however is not that good. It's really generic and doesn't offer anything unique. The game is not optimized very well though, I found myself experiencing frequent FPS drops which did hinder my enjoyment of the game. This made me angry because the graphics aren't even that good, I was still reduced to about 20 FPS for most of the game.

,Recommended,411960,28967385,Posted: 2 January,all,Akira,"Now, allow me to provide a little backstory. I got this game back when I was roughly 9? 10 years old? Back then, it was around the time the PS2 era had hit a spike in popularity, so naturally, I got this game as a Christmas gift, and I fell in love with it. Maybe it's because furry animals are a guilty pleasure of mine, but that's a story for a different day.Naturally, when I saw this game was on sale on Steam, nostalgia got the better of me, and I bought it in a heartbeat. Playing it as an adult, as one would expect, is certainly different from how it was when I was a kid, and that's putting it lightly. This is both a good and a bad thing, and I'll go ahead and break it down so I don't waste more of your time with unimportant backstory.Gameplay. 6/10It's... About what you would expect from a platformer on a PS2 at the time. You jump around, collect stuff, complete objectives to move on to the next level, kill enemies, and has some side missions on the side. It doesn't necesarrily deviate from the 3D platformers at the time like Spyro, Crash Bandicoot and other games,  so if you're looking for something revolutionary, this definitely isn't it.I would say that in terms of gameplay, this game is pretty close to Banjo Kazooie, in the sense that most of the game revolves around collecting stuff to get more stuff.This isn't to say that it's BAD, or COMPLETELY unoriginal. One thing that does set this game apart is a few things, such as replacing double jumping with gliding, using Boomerangs as weapons rather than fire or, well, your fists, and the fact that there are very few levels with ""unique"" mechanics that change the gameplay a bit.There are times, however, where the objective is not clearly communicated. For example, in one level, you are supposed to use coconuts to get across some quicksand. This is not properly explained or hinted it unless you decided to just randomly throw some boomerangs around. The game stops nearly all hand holding about halfway through, so if you don't understand how to do something, you're on your own in that regard.I give the gameplay a solid 6/10. It's nothing really special or out of the ordinary, but it's by no means boring. The game has just enough for you to do and kill so you won't be left wandering aimlessly and figuring out what to do.Story. 3/10.The story is cheesy, that's all there is to say about it. It's a pretty by the book ""you're the chosen hero that has to save the world"" scenario that's typical of games around this era.The story also relies on a lot of ex-machina scenarios (An antagonist showing up when you least expect it, falling into a hole at the very beginning and finding out the entire backstory completely out of the blue, and so on), so at times, it does feel like things happen out of the blue without any reason.Really, there isn't much to say about the story. It's fairly predictable despite things happening seemingly out of no where, character development is near enough nonexistent, and... That's it.Graphics. 5/10For a PS2 game, the graphics aren't bad. They aren't GREAT, but they aren't abysmal, either. Much like its gameplay, it's what you would expect from a PS2 era platformer: low renders and flat angles.At times, the game does feel a little empty, but that's only in the first couple of levels. Nothing is really boring to look at, and aesthetically, the game is pretty pleasing. You have rainforests, snow areas and ocean areas, and each level has pretty good lighting and scenery that gives it the feel it's going for.Overall: 6/10The game is definitely much better as a child than as a fully grown adult. While it does have enough to keep someone interested in terms of gameplay, and it doesn't really get stale, it suffers from playing things a little too safe. Nothing about it is extraordinary or revolutionary in any way, which isn't necesarrily a bad thing, but it makes the game ultimately forgettable.I recommend this game for younger audiences, since I am sure that younger folks will find a lot more enjoyment out of it than older. If you are an older person looking for a good PS2 platformer, I can't really say that this is what you're looking for. If you want to try it out, by all means, go for it-- it's not a bad game by any means. There are just other PS2 games that do what this game does but better."

Regardless of those two things though I still found it increadibly enjoyable as a relaxed and fun game that itsn't too simple but enough is going on to keep you playing.

,Recommended,411960,29705013,Posted: 4 February,all,thelonechipmunk,"After replaying the whole game again after it left early access to become the full version, I'll now rewrite my review, whether that changes much or not, to represent the final product.Ty the Tasmanian Tiger is a game for fans of platformers. It's a classic collectathon game with not a lot of emphasis on story or graphics. In terms of difficulty, it's quite frankly a game for kids, as it is for the most part very easy to progress through. Somes bosses may stump you unlike the rest of the game due to a lack of guidance combined with very unobvious tasks you must do (Particularly the Fluffy's Fjord level).For the most part, Ty's level design is done quite well. Many levels are very linear, but with enough twists and turns to make them fun to play, while several are very large and open. One might call the larger levels rather empty, but this is expected given the limitations of the time this game was made in. So for what they did accomplish, these levels are still impressive, and even beautiful in some cases.Graphics are obviously nothing to write home about. They're kept relatively basic as the game is focused on gameplay instead. None of the textures, effects, etc are pixilated or unnecessarily blurry, so they're really not a cause for concern. Lighting and shadows are nicely done in the remaster, and the remastered version allows you to see things MUCH further away than in the original, which makes for some amazing views and nice spotting points to search the map for collectables you might be missing.Ty the Tasmanian Tiger's soundtrack is excellent, featuring mostly great songs and some that are just downright amazing (Two Up). There are a couple odd balls, mainly the boulder minigame theme, but you'll rarely find yourself immediately hating a song (Only after you've spent an hour trying to find the last opal).The occasional quirk you might encounter might include the infra-rang sound effect or camera trouble. The infra-rang is just down-right annoying, and as for the camera, there are settings you can use to adjust it closer to your liking. If you still have trouble after that, it's probably more your fault than the game's, being that I myself never had problems with the camera as bad as others might describe.Regarding bugs or oddities of any sort, I've found only two things so far while playing the game. I'm unsure whether this is the game's fault or not, but it seems to have potential for slight incompatibilities with some computer settings. I changed power usage settings at some point before finishing my second playthrough found that the lighting effects were too strong and some particle effects had boxes around them. While these errors are not at all severe and won't distract you much, they are still errors nonetheless. However on the level ""Lyre, Lyre Pants on Fire"", there is a possibly gamebreaking bug. It is possible you may comb the level and still be missing a few opals. This is because there Y coordinates can glitch out (Or are just flat out incorrect, I'm not sure), making them impossible to reach and/or find. Fear not though, for they can also glitch out again by reloading the level (Or this is Krome's idea of a fix), and spawn in a respawned crate, from which you can acquire the missing opals. Finally the weird landscape at the end of ""Beyond the Black Stump"" isn't bugged out or anything. It's just lazyness or a lack of time for polishing.For what the game is trying to be, it's very well crafted. It's certainly nothing less than at least a descent game. If you enjoy platformers, Ty the Tasmanian Tiger is definitely a title to pick up."

I have been searching for nearly invisable boxes throwing my kaboom boomerangs around and hoping i will find those last few. Still to no avail. Great game though and it reminds me so much of a happier time. It is just a shame about how OCD i get about completing it 100%.

76561198417356851,Recommended,411960,34714462,Posted: 3 September,all,DazzlingDazzaD94,"I remember as a kid how much I loved playing this game. TY was a huge part of my childhood and I remember stumbling across this game in one of my local game stores. I must have been around 9 years old when I first played it back in the day and I have so many fond childhood memories of this classic childhood gem. When I found out sometime last year that the developers of the series wanted to remaster and revamp the game up to today`s modern day and age technology, I couldn`t have been more thrilled and excited to see one of my favourite childhood games comeback to life. I only just got a brand new PC a few weeks ago and I couldn`t wait to buy it on Steam and sit down with this gem to take a nice stroll down memory lane.The game feels like exactly how I remember it. The developers have done a smashing job on making this an amazing port of a classic. The visuals in the game look beautiful, the soundtracks to the levels are still the good old same fun rocking tunes that I love and remember. There`s been quite a few improvments though that I have noticed which make this port even more of a perfect hit such as the loading times which have been dramatically improved over the original game. Taken no more than 2 - 3 seconds max to load up a single level or your saved game file which is fantastic. I love how they have enhanced and revamped everything in the game and the developers have certainly put alot of hard work and effort into making this a solid good tremendous port that is well worth the valueble purchase of your wallet.TY is a beautiful gorgeous 3D platformer that is well worth investing your money in if your a huge fan of many other great platformers out there that were great back in the day from the likes of Ratchet and Clank , Jak and Daxter , Sly Cooper then you will most certanily love this. If you`ve already played the original back in the day in your childhood then by all means this is without a doubt worth another round of replaying through. If your a newcomer to the series but are a fan of platfomers then TY is a game definitely worth giving a shot and I highly recommend it to all those platformer fans out there who have yet to discover the series as well as newcomers out there who are willing to give it a try.For those who are new to the games TY is more of a open ended 3D platformer game that is very easy to pick up and enjoy though the game is quite linear as well. The storyline of the game is pretty much simple, you guide TY through a number of levels collecting a variety of different collectables on your travels such as opals , thunder eggs and bilbies that help you progress through the game. The main plot of the game for background purposes is to retrieve back all the talismans from the evil boss Cass who plans to use them for his own uses to rule the world.Features in the game as a small breakdown- Open ended charming 3D platformer with a fun cast of characters to meet- A huge variety of boomerangs that help aid you in your quest- Run . jump , swing and glide through 17 amazing levels full of great platforming and challenge- Offers a nice variety of mini games- Beautiful and updated enhanced graphicsThe performance of the game is very good. It runs pretty much smooth with very little hiccups. The design of the levels are stunning and have been reworked , revamped and polished very well to golden standards. It`s amazing to see that even 15 years on after it`s release that TY still has the power of showing how good and strong the 3D platformer genre is. This is a worthy port and a prime example of a how a great port of a classic should be done. It`s been handled with great love and care by the developers and I couldn`t be more greatful and thankful to them for making this happen. It`s such a warm feeling inside and feels good to have this classic childhood franchise back in my life again. Everytihng in the original is on par with what they have done with the port.What I will also say is as well is that TY is one of those platformers out there that is more forgiving than other hardcore platformers such as Crash Bandicoot. You will find that many parts of the game can be forgiving at times making this ease of accessible to newcomers out there who may not be familiar with the core of the game`s mechanics. Just as an example  to show how forgiving the mechanics are to those who are new and unaware the checkpoint system within the levels of the game are quite frequent and there`s quite alot them placed through out the levels which is nice since it can benefit those who may struggle in later parts of the game whereas compared to the hardcore platformer types out there such as Crash Bandicoot, you`ll find checkpoints are place very far out in between. Also the gamepad controls for the game are very easy to pick up and learn and there is no need to hassle around with controller configuration as the game has full integration support of controller gamepad`s which means all the controls are all automatically set up for you and ready to use when you boot the game up.My conclusion summary and my final thoughts on the gameA beautiful and very well crafted port that I couldn`t recommend more. If your a fan of the old school 3D type platformers then TY is a another one of those childhood revival classics that you will love and if you have yet to dip your feet into this series then by all means give it a try if you have some cash floating around because it is a blast to play and I would recommend this to any newcomer who is just looking for a relaxing, casual and fun game to pick up. On a final note I want to say a massive thank you to Krome Studio`s for brinigng back one of my all time favourite nostalgia classics of all time. So many great childhood memories with this game and it feels so great to take a nice trip down memory lane to relive this classic. Absolutely stunning and amazing game that deserves another chance at getting rebooted in the near future. A great game with great value at a great affordable price.BONZA! You still got the magic KROME Studio`sScore - 9/10( PROS )- A solid well hand crafted 3D platformer with smooth and responding controls- Great cast of characters each with there own unique fun personalities- Epic and awsome soundtracks for each and every level- Great variety in weapon choice of the number of boomerangs on offer which each define many different types of damage and wondeful effects that lead to great and fun gameplay when using them- Good camera controls and cut-scenes render very good( Negitives )- A few minor bugs and little frame rates clipping from time to time but overall runs very smooth in most parts of the game.That concludes my review and my very first review for a Steam product."

EA Sports+ so many boomerangs y'all+ ""aussie"" vibes. the characters seem like stereotypes at times (crikey, you ripper!), but it feels like they're trying to get kids to think australian culture is badass rather than try to mock it+ really likeable characters+ colorful worlds show how diverse the australian landscape is (I assume, I've never been). srsly this game seems like one big travel ad for australia+ great, wild-sounding music (walk in the park is FIRE)+ the translation issues have been fixed from the gamecube build- gliding physics are weak- some of the objectives are way too easy"

Many years later, I finally get to complete this game 100%, and suffice to say, it was worth the wait. Although the story is super corny, the camera is very finnicky and the game itself is kind of clunky, there is a unique charm to this game that I can't discredit it for. The characters are very memorable (albeit very one dimensional) and the boss fights are stunning (extremely confusing at first, though). The selcetion of rangs are great and the music is top notch. It took me many years to finally complete this game, and now I can honestly say, this game is very much okay!"

,Recommended,411960,34989467,Posted: 15 September,all,spooky tanuki,"After seeing this game on Steam, my nostalgia kicked in faster than a jack rabbit on a horn pickle.Ty the Tasmanian Tiger is a game about a Tasmanian Tiger name Ty that must recover ancient talismans in order to stop the main villain of the game, through the use of many different boomerangs of course.The game itself has aged like fine wine, some of it still tastes a little sour though, to put it simply. In all honesty I can't really review the game in it's entirety yet since I've yet to complete it, plus I don't remember much from playing as a child because I had PTSD on Crikey's Cove, but so far I highly recommend buying this game as it's aussie charm and unique gameplay mechanics should be enough to keep you in the down under."

,Recommended,411960,35050209,Posted: 18 September,all,lococraftplays,This game is targeted at young children (probably younger than 10) so if your a bit older i would think a bit before buying it. The fact that its targeted at children means that yes levels will feel repetitive and any puzzle aspect of the game is simple.The reason for recommending this is because i do enjoy (i could be blinded by nostalgia) and the port has been improved over time (it was quite bad when it was first released).

Love it. Awesome port of a classic game from the past. Been playing this when I have time. Works well with a Keyboard/Mouse, but really excels when played with a Steam Controller. Feels just like the the original but with some smoothed out graphics and effects, gameplay was kept original.If you loved this Boomerang throwing Thylacine growing up you'll love this game all over again. So far no issues, may update this as I find any little hiccups, but so far so good."

,Recommended,411960,35461816,Posted: 3 October,all,confirmed..,"This game man, it brings back so much nostalgia for me. I remember coming back from school one day and pops had a bought my brother and I an Xbox (fun fact I was scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ by the ambience in the main menu on the Xbox so I hurries as much as I could to start a game or have a game inside it when starting the console). The games we had were Halo CE and this game, I liked halo but this game was just so much more enjoyable for me, the simplicity but still the depth it brought forward was enough to satisfy my childish self to continue and play and grind to get all those golden cogs and eggs so I could test out all those different varieties of boomerangs and I simply had a blast.Now when I look back I can still feel the joy I once felt purely from nostalgia, but with growing up and getting wiser and more perceptive, I also notice the games flaws. I felt it could get a bit too repetitive and some worlds were too large without really any way too get from point A to point B without running and feeling time consuming.Gameplay wise it feels satisfying to throw the boomerangs, you can feel the weight behind the biting attack and the enemies are mildly difficult depending on your experience of these kind of games. Bosses felt original and fun to fight against (for the most part) and most levels are fun and original (except the hog riding level, that♥♥♥♥♥♥is ♥♥♥♥ing trash). The movement is good mostly but the parts where you need to walk slowly eg. Over thin ice it can feel frustrating because it is inconsistent. But the core gameplay is good for the most part. And the positives outshines the negatives.The charming Australian caricature is funny and gives the game a sense of originality because if it didn't have the boomerang gameplay and the quirky accents it would pretty much be a rehash of every other plarform-type game that was consistently made during that time. And I think that's an strong plus.Honestly the whole genre of platform games are old and don't really fit my taste in games anymore. I may try to pick them up to give my inner childishness some respect but I more easily get drawn to more modern games. But that doesent remove the enjoyment that I will have from these kind of games under smaller gaming sessions. So I will simply say that if you have played this game once when you were younger pick it up and play it for the nostalgic effect, and those that haven't played this game (furthermore even heard of this game) try to pick it up as I dare to say that it truly is a hidden gem of it's time when it washed released. I recommend it."
