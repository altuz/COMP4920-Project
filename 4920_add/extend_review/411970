Much like my previous experiences with Ty 1, the characters, bosses, and gameplay all in all are top notch. Each of those missions give me that rewarding good feeling after completing them and I'm amazed by diversity of those missions. Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2 is a good pick for those who enjoy adventure games and collecting things.I look forward to seeing this game get updated in the future."

,Recommended,411970,30640585,Posted: 20 March,all,Farixy,"TY the Tasmanian Tiger 2 is as good as it was back in the days when I first played it on the Playstation 2. But even if you've never played it before it still holds up to this very day, surely the graphics aren't as fancy as some of the titles of today but the gameplay, the voice acting, and humor is all here in one solid package. Krome studios really does Early Access the right way.In terms of graphics it's more or less the same as the previous game, a flashback to the sixth generation console graphics, and features a very colorful and cartoony art-style.This sequel features australian accents, cute koalas and a whole lot of collecting items just like most old-school 3D platformers did, including the previous game TY the Tasmanian Tiger 1. But this time they've spiced things up by adding a lot more variation compared to the previous game, for example you get to use more types of vehicles including go-karts, trucks, mechanical body suits, submarines and turrets.Also the way you progress in this game has been changed, instead of collecting ""thunder eggs"" to progress in the game you complete various missions to unlock a crucial story mission which will move you forward in the story and unlock new areas in the game.Overall TY 2 is a great game for both kids aswell as adults, doesn't matter if you played the game almost 13 years ago when it first was released or decide to give it a go today. And while the story is one of those typical stories about a suprisingly rich mastermind who wants to take over the world it's still very intriguing and gives you the desire to progress further into the game. I strongly recommend this game since it's a lot of fun, especially for the pricetag and even more if you're a fan of older 3D platformers. And as I mentioned, Krome did Early Access right with TY 1 and knowing them I'm sure they will with TY 2 aswell, also a very friendly bunch of developers clearly passionated about the game and the franchise. A few people have had issues with getting this game to work with a keyboard and a mouse at launch, but right away they got a respons from one of the developers saying they're already working on it, which brings a smile to my face knowing that they care about the fans and listens to what the fans have to say."

Krome Studios did a great job with the first port and so far this one is great too. I love being able to play at 60FPS. It makes the game so much better and easier to control since its smoother.10/10 (so far, don't ruin it plz)"
,Recommended,411970,33530083,Posted: 13 July,all,Shrimphony,"This game is amazing. 11/10 would play for hours then die knowing they lived a life fulfilled.Taking off the nostaliga goggles now.This game game out originally when I was a kid, so back then I wasn't aware of what a good ps2 game really was. Looking back, I can say that this game, while not particularly a pioneer of the system, was very well made for the system and its time. The game takes the parts of its predecessor that worked very well (the rang variation, story, setting, characters, and physics, among many other things) and fleshs them out to a much fuller extent.The voice actors (some of whom are different from the first) did a much better job with their voicing of the characters. The new ""home area"", Bush rescue HQ along with the city of Burramudgee serve as a much improved replacement to the hub world of rainbow cliffs from the first game. Rather than being big and bland, this new area is home to lost of things to do, from getting collectibles to even some missions. As mentioned before, Ty 1's hub world was how you accessed missions. Ty 2, however, has you driving in a somewhat open world, choosing what missions you do in the various areas available. This areas are rather pretty too.More than just pretty, however, they are populated, with enemies, npcs and missions. and while each area is surrounded by a large fence on the outside, within the areas there exist very few if any invisible walls, meaning you're allowed rather free movement throughout them. Something other platformers often suffer from that Ty 2 doesnt is weapon restriction. Ty 2, rather than relying on limited power ups or loadout slots, can carry any rang he owns with him, wherever he goes, meaning you can use any weapon you want at your pleasure.What does Ty 2 do wrong however? No game is perfect, and certainly Ty 2 does not break free from that. Ty 2 on the ps2 suffered from a multitude of lock up issues and performance issues, however those issues were largely corrected in this port (as well were the graphics. It's rather pretty now). In my opinion, the only real thing that hurts Ty 2 is the cart racing minigame.Obviously inspired by mario kart, its a shame work on the real game was diverted to it. It's not all that bad. Especially with the port's recent updates to it. But it does feel rather like a ripoff of mario kart, and it's not really fun. Requiring it to 100% the game is rather annoying as well.But overall, I say the base game stands the test of time, and the HD remaster port of it updates it to be on level with other games released in this generation. If you like platformers, you'll love this game. If you like stylized games, you'll love this game. And if you liked the ps2, gamecube or xbox versions of this game, well duh youll especially love this game. I'd rate this game Great out of Great"

Originally played it as a young child on the Original Xbox console. I already had a soft spot for the game, and when it got re-released on steam I just had to grab it.STORYTy 2 start off shortly after where Ty 1 left off… the Reptile forces are trying to break Boss Cass free from Currawong Jail. The prison where boss Cass got locked up following the event of ty 1. Ty and his friends do their very best to keep him locked up. But their efforts are not enough. Boss Cass breaks free with the help of his lead henchwoman Fluffy…Following their failed attempt to keep Cass locked up the heroes form Bush Rescue. This strike team will allow them to better respond to distress calls all over the outback. Boss Cass his whereabouts are known but due to diplomatic immunity the heroes cannot arrest him. This is because Cass has setup his own country called Cassopolis.GAMEPLAYSoon after the first mission you get dropped in to the open world, here you can do mission that become available to you. Once you've done enough mission within the outback the game will progress its story. This goes in the form of a boss battle or special mission. Just like the opening mission these are very scripted, But most importantly very fun!Ty 2 is a platformer in heart. The core gameplay is solid and fun. Ty feels good to control, And jumping feels responsive and fast. Two attack types are available: his Boomerangs and a Bite Attack, he is a Tiger after all.The boomerangs come in many types, like Fire, Ice and rope Boomerangs. You can get them in shops in town and upgrade at Sly’s tree house. You use the Red Coins you collect all over the outback to pay for them. These 'Rangs make combat and platforming easier and will allow ty to reach places he couldn’t reach before.Other than 'Rangs you can also buy Bunyip license. Bunyip’s are mech suits used for combat, exploration or clearing a path.Having the licenses is required to do some missions, same goes for the Boomerangs. This is a very annoying aspect of the design, because you're not always told what license or 'Rang you will need to do the mission. (Get them as soon as you can!)COLLECTIONWithin the world of Ty2 you can collect many things. Of course the currency is all over the place, but you can also get Cogs, Chromium Orbs and Bilbies. The Chromium Orbs can be used to buy maps, they will show you the location of the other items to collect, they are required to get 100%. Also one of the best things to find is a guy called goo-boo (lost) Steve.OTHERYou might also have noticed I have not mentioned the cart racing mini game, they are scattered around the open world for you to do, luckily they are not required for the main plot to go forward because they (‘’Suuuuuuuuuck’’) are very bad. I’m pretty sure some people find them enjoyable but I can't get in to them. That's why I didn’t include them in this review.This review is based on the latest ''Experimental'' build of TY the Tasmanian Tiger 2 on Steam.Version: Build r2675_v071If youre a big fan of platformers like Rayman 2 and if you have a soft spot of cheesy Saturday morning cartoons Ty the Tasmanian tiger 2 will be right up your allyTitle: TY the Tasmanian Tiger 2Genre: Action, Adventure, Indie, Early AccessDeveloper:Krome StudiosPublisher:Krome StudiosRelease Date: 20 Mar, 2017http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=888007235If you spot a mistake in grammer you can let me know, ill try to fix it.Cheers,"

,Recommended,411970,31793090,Posted: 16 May,all,Salty Skeleton,"In all honesty, I bought this game out of nostalgia. I myself grew up with playstation one and two and had few games in them. They were not major titles and differed in quality but I remember this game the most. Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2.I didn't know why until I bought the PC port. This game is not just a game that you buy because of nostalgia, this game is actually an undiscovered gem hidden in the PS2's libary.Sure the controls are a bit wonky as with every old game port but that is quickly fixed with some key changing. Unlike most PC ports this one is not a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥game ported by a major company because they knew they would get money out of it. This game was ported FOR people who like the game but couldn't get it because they would need to buy a PS2 again BY people who like the game and it really shows.If I was forced to show a major game company how to port games this game (And the first one) would be it.You know what they say, A Good PC Port is worth Two in TheBushhad to get one in there, you know?"

,Recommended,411970,30712219,Posted: 24 March,all,Karma,"Note: My review is set to change as more updates come out, please beware that the game is not 100% polished yet.TL:DR - Buy the game if you are a fan of the series but also platformers and collectathon type games. It runs well and plenty to do for what you pay for.+ Runs smoothly (for the most part)+ Bigger world+ More puzzles+ Keyboard & Controller support- Racing- Cutscenes- Random slow-down- No check-list- Biting IssueThe game runs well, for a game larger than Ty 1 I expected it to run kinda slow due to it being not 100% polished but it runs very well. Only in minor areas has the game just slowed down for no real reason but has quickly fixed itself. I believe the loading gates are to thank for this and they don't seem to drag on as much as I remember they used to do.Not really much to put for what is good about the game other than it runs well, more to do and explore. It is a nice upgrade from Ty 1. It is fun, the charm is still there, it feels like a more better world due to the towns and other characters being involved.There are more puzzles, some which are harder than others to solve (looking at you Volcano!) but still enjoyable. You are getting your money's worth in game-play but also in memories for those that grew up playing the series.---------------------------------Now, my issue is with a few things, or nit-picks.Firstly Ty will often face left or right randomly after 3-4 bites of a spy egg breaking your combo. This can be an issue for some collectables or area's.There is no check-list (yet) of what collectables you are missing from which map which can be annoying when finding picture frames but due to some other power-ups it is not a big issue as after all it is quite fun to explore the new maps you are given.The voices in cut-scenes are too low and can rarely be heard, many are having this issue and the developers have said they will be sorting it :).The races in the game, are complete frustration. Around 3 races are fine, no issue but the final 4 races is where you see an issue. The A.I suddenly speeds up without a power-up, cut corners perfectly and tend to auto-aim at you. It is pure luck with some drifting skill and short-cut usage to complete some of the maps. It will take a few tries but you will see the pure luck involved such as the A.I attacking each other or even getting stuck on a turtle they didn't before so you could steal the win. But this issue is back from the platform version so just a heads up on how annoying they may be for some users even to this day.Again most of these are just nit-picks. Some of the collectables are a pain to get due to perfect pixel jumps are needed but the game is not fully done and some bugs and such are being found and solved by the developers which I thank for their quick response on certain issues.The developers are active in fixing any new issues found and are proven to be more than one-off's as well as the community's input on certain parts of the game.Keep it up developers~"

,Recommended,411970,30648822,Posted: 21 March,all,Janni,"Absolutely yes.""Ty The Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue"" is a sequel to the game ""Ty The Tasmanian Tiger"", both absolutely great games. I spent many hours of my childhood playing both games, and now finally the second part of my favorite childhood game got released on Steam.Besides small bugs, the game runs very smoothly on my computer (Intel I5, EVGA GTX 980, 16GB Ram) and the graphics are still nostalgic, old-school like. Obviously because the game is an old one, the graphics is what it is; but the game is still enjoyable and brings back so many good memories to me.Compared to Ty The Tasmanian Tiger, this one has an element of ""open world"" - even if it's not so massive you'd see in days done this year it's still impressive if you take the year of original release into consideration. Otherwise it's the same, loveable boomerang-throwing Tiger in action.I definitely recommend the game, especially if you've played it in your childhood."

,Recommended,411970,33051133,Posted: 30 June,all,Supahderporeon,"This is a port of the Gamecube/Playstation 2/Xbox game released in 2004 by the same software studio, Krome, which is now it's own publisher for this IP.This game really brings me back. It was already a very good game back then, and 13 years later, it still holds the same level of polish and fun it used to. This is a collectathon platformer, though the collectables are not completely required to comeplete it unlike others. There are the Krome coins and silver cogs, which are hidden around or require hard platforming to reach, and there are also ""billibies,"" which require rescuing. Unlike Ty 1, there is often only 1 to save in each level, compared to the 5 in the predecessor.Also unlike the original, the game takes place in an ""open world"" connected by driving a jeep around to each stopping point. Some are full levels, others are side missions. Some are even racetracks, which have a similar feel to Crash Team Racing, while being a bit more... loose in some regards. This is required for 100%, so meh.Rather than using guns or other weapons, Ty's gimmick is throwing twin boomerangs, which have various effects tied to them. From being able to see hidden boxes, to melting ice, and grappling onto rings, there is more than enough variety, even over the original to keep changing it up for yourself. This time around, Ty gets to use large mechs called ""Bunyips,"" that allow you to extinguish flames, lift impossibly heavy objects, and dish out massive physical damage. The segments are laid out perfectly to introduce new stronger enemies, or explore some areas more effectively.Unlocking new Rangs', more health, and the keys needed to control the Bunyips require the game's currency, Opals. They can be found floating around, but the majority of them are gained by completing missions, collecting the collectables, and finding bags of them around the game world.Overall, this is a really good game. It's what I think Spyro could have been post S3, and far, far more. Getting this game on console would be good, and I would recommend the Gamecube release over the others from my own experience with all the controllers/console specs.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now, to my review of this port:The most notible thing is that the game runs 60 FPS over the original 30. Wow what a difference this makes to this game. It runs so well, even on ageing hardware. But the real fun is how the enhancements are. The game has options for resolutions of 1920x1080 and up, anti-aliesing of up to 8x, better texture/bumpmapping, and more to be added by the developers in the coming months. For even the max of the max, my GTX860M could more than keep up with everything, and still deliver buttery smooth performance.The only issue, is how the effects of some rangs' and far off objects, such as the oil platform at the beach wouldnt render properly. This is more than likely an error of the new camera system, but it is still an issue affecting me with this review.This is the most excellent port of any game I have seen on Steam so far, how it hasn't caught enough traction yet is beyond me. Absolutely pick this up on sale, and I would still pick it up full price."

To give a reference it plays a bit like GTA, but the world is way richer in story and atmosphere than GTA from the same time period. The convertion from PS2 to PC works great, all you have to do is tweak some of the keybinding fx. zoom to W, aim to mouse 4 and lock on to mouse 5 works great for me. Camera lock when jump is also a setting that makes the playing experience better.This game is just as great as i remeber it and now that i'm old enough to undestand what they are saying, english is not my native language, the games is even more enjoyable.I think people in all ages can enjoy this game, it's the kind of game that has hitten eastereggs for adults to enjoy.I'm so happy they converted it to PC, thx for making one of my all time favorite games playable for me again!"

So again if you have a craving for an old-fashioned collection with solid platforming mechanics that has aged very well, then you NEED to buy the first game and the second game.The GoodWell optimised. Even at the start of early access, I can crank this game up on a old laptop i5 and still run the game fine. So I can only hope (like the last games early access updates) that the team keep up the bug fixing and performance optimisation and making the game look pretty good for a game that came out almost 13 years ago!The gameplay has not been affected or will be, the console classic still feels just as solid and enjoyable as I remember it on the Gamecube!The main reason for my 'Good points' section so short is everything I could praise the company for I have already mentioned in the review of the first game. I will be more critical than I usually am because I want this game to succeed, and the best way to improve something is to work on its shortfalls.NOTE: These issues are in EARLY access so all these issues are subject to change.The BadWhen using a mouse and keyboard the game will still show's the Xbox Gamepad controls making my first time trying to get into a bunyip irritating, and makes the UI look incredibly out of place due to the wrong controls displayed.Lighting is a bit glitchy with character models having an odd glow look at times even when they're not in direct sunlight.On a minor note I noticed a decent amount of texture clipping issues (probably due to the lighting making the clipping more obvious than before).I did notice a lot of texture pop-in while the game makes objects subtlety fade in (as to not to become distracting), the draw distance is still rather close so if it would be possible to make a render distance setting and making it as far or as short as needed that would be appreciated.These are the most noticeable things I have run into with this early version of the game, and yet again Krome did it almost flawlessly and compared to a lot of other HD remakes this is by far one of the most promising!Keep up the good work!

,Recommended,411970,30639361,Posted: 20 March,all,Glenny✪,I recommend it if you're a fan of the franchise. If you're not then.. still buy it! It's a great game and an improvement from the first Ty. BUT it will have issues like some sounds will sound distorted or not updated yet like for example - Throw the flamerang and hear it's wonders.. but that's early access for you! They will fix that in the near future but this is just a review that just came out right after the game release.The game runs well on my end. Sometimes it goes from 60fps to 30 but they did achieve the goal to make it early access and that is by making it playable! They will soon fix all the sounds and especially put more optimization work into certain parts of the game in the future updates. I have high hopes to see this be the perfect game once it's finished and remake the third Ty.  This game did make it to my childhood and i hope this is a game that will be one of your favourites too. I would suggest using a controller but if you don't have one then it should be fine to use the keyboard. If there are any issues that you may come across in this game you can be able to report it in the forums and the staff can be able to reach out to you as soon as possible and they are friendly.Krome Studios keep up the good work ya hear? :D

Anyway, I'll be editing this review later when it's fixed. I just wanted to post one of the first reviews for the game. Have a nice day.Edit 1:The main menu soundtrack is awesome. That's all I've got so far.Edit 2:The issue was fixed with a quick patch. I will come up with an actual review after playing it for a while.REVIEW:I gotta say that I'm quite fond of this game. First off, I really love the sounds on this game: that includes both the soundtrack and voiceacting. There is always a chill and appropriate music going on in the background and the 'Stralian accent of the characters is awesome. The story is meh. It's just a classic ""Go after the bad guy"" story. While the gameplay is really fun, I'm not a big fan of the combat system. You just keep spamming Left-click until all the enemies lay dead with a very few things you have to do to avoid getting hit. The atmosphere is great and chill. And lastly, there are still a few issues. The hints display XBOX keys even if you're playing with keyboard & mouse, there are other XBOX related things here and there too so it's really easy to tell that it's an XBOX port. Anyway, I'm sure those will be fixed as this game is still on Early Access. I'd recommend this game."

76561198320394459,Recommended,411970,32276634,Posted: 8 June,all,Supreme,"Most of what made me buy this game was nostalgia. The default controls are not very good for keyboard (though most of them are rebindable), the camera is a traitor that will stab you in the back when you least expect it (especially when platforming), the platforming can be a pain on occasion, especially when falling kills you or forces you to reclimb the entire puzzle. I also feel like the different boomerangs could all just be one boomerang with various upgrades applied, or have a better system for swapping, as switching between them isn't as comfortable as it was on the PS2 (to be fair, at least it freezes the game when the boomerang menu is open, so it isn't as bad as it could be).PS: This should probably be in a bug report, but I noticed that alot of the achievements seem bugged. In my case, I haven't gotten the one for bying out the Rang Shop, or the one for buying all Bunyip Keys, nor have I gotten the one for finding Steve in every location. I haven't used cheats, but I did notice when I returned to Madame Mopoke, and I had found 27 of the things, that I had 27 to spend despite already having bought the first map near the beginning of the game, suggesting that she hadn't subtracted for the first purchase. Maybe the game thought I was cheating because of that?It's currently early access, so these problems are forgiveable, but they do need to be straightened out before the full release.EDIT: I initally gave this game a negative review primarily based on the racing. The racing has now been improved in the experimental beta to the point where I feel I can legitimately recommend this game when these racing changes are implemented in the main game. It still feels like it needs a little bit of improvement, but I commend the developers for their work, which made the racing feel more smooth and natural. It does feel more natural on the controller than the keyboard, but given that it was initially released on the PS2, this is fair enough. I recommend playing with a controller.This is why I have now changed my review. Good job and I hope the game continues to improve."
,Recommended,411970,30787404,Posted: 27 March,all,Lace and Lancer,"Early Access is an incredible successful hit. Ty 2 brings back such nostalgia in this remastered PC version. Ty the Tasmanian Tiger was the first ever proper video game I ever played as a child and sparked the idea of my parents buying me a PS2 for Christmas. Although some players might struggle with the initial controls, it's simply a matter of finding the proper keyboard bindings that suit your needs. Ty 2 is a brilliant follow up to the original. The misssion based, more open-world concept is still unique and timeless. More advanced players may find it a bit repetitive and childish (it is a game targeted towards younger people, after all) but all of the collectibles and the in-game/out of game racing games can create a great challenge. I found myself struggling through a few missions and I thoroughly enjoyed the hours of game play. The Krome development team is absolutely fantastic and so involved in the discussions. Thanks so much for listening to the commnity and bringing my chlidhood back!"

My biggest complaint however is that I can't collect everything and obtain 100%. This all has to do with the lasharaing, which made it's debut within this game as an optional boomerang that you can get a the rang shop that is owned my Ty's mother and father for 4,000 opal. Whenever I use the lasharang, Ty's character model goes all over the place, making it impossible to make precise platforming, especially when trying to get the Kromomiums within Burramudge Town. I also kind of don't like the way that the lighting of the flamarang reflects on Ty. In the original games, I always loved using the flamarang because I thought that it made Ty look bada$% with the whole lighting effects. Personally, I can forgive all of these problems and concerns that I have noticed so far, since the game is still in early access, meaning that Krome Studios isn't truely finished working on the HD port of Ty 2 Bush Rescue, again, the lasharang being a great example of this. I'm sorry, but I'm a completionists, and whenever I see a collectable that I can't obtain, I get upset. Overall, I am very pleased with how this game has turned out from what I have played so far. I also love how GORGEOUS this game looks. Krome Studios, if you are reading this, and you probably are, thank you for doing an amazing job bringing this classic game to steam in glorious, crisp HD. Please get to fixing the problems that I stated in this review as soon as possible. Also P.S., you forgot to get rid of the triangle sign on the help signs when porting Ty 2 Bush Rescuse to steam. Just thought that I had to let you know about that. :) Also, if I gave this game a rating, I would give it a 7.5/10."

If your coming to this from the original game then don't expect it to be structured the same way. It is no longer a collectathon but rather a GTA styled platformer with missions you can complete to get opals (currency) which let you purchase bunyip vehicles and different boomerangs. The vehicles are cool but barely get used each one getting 2 to 3 uses before never touching them again. Getting different boomerangs will allow you to explore little sections of each area, complete small puzzles to get extra collectables which usually end up awarding you with more opals, and can just be applied to combat. On top of this you can purchase upgraded versions of boomerangs you already own, ranging from the multirang which allows you to throw large heaps of basic boomerangs at once to the deadlyrang which grants remote control and explodes. These upgraded 'rangs are necessary to defeat the bigger enemies so you should at least get one of these to handle those.All in all this game is fun and filled with the same platforming the original had just in a different structure and a slightly larger emphasis on combat."

I could go on a rant about the subject and the game but i write enough in college, but to put simply:this was a defining game of my childhood back in the good old PS2 days along with crash bandicoot and the two star wars battlefronts. Its amazing to see Ty 2 finally ported over and its something i never thought would happen. The game looks just like i remember (which was probably♥♥♥♥♥♥back in the day compared to modern standards) but that is thanks to it being redone in HD and a lot more grass (The only difference i can remember visually). Even today the whole look of the game still stands up and thats without nostalgia factor: its more of a cartoon look to begin with so it can visually stand the test of time better than games meant to represent true-to-life. It can be better compared to an Indy game by todays standards and a great one at that. With the Game only being $20 back in the day, the $12 price for early-access is amazing (id pay the full $20 anyways). The best $12 nostalgia-buy i've done. This port can literally be played by anyone without concern for graphics as thats not really a driving force for the game. Its just a stupid-funny/slight slapstick comedy feel out in a moderately exagerated australia (perhaps the accents are a bit stereotypical but idc)."

So far I've noticed a few bugs such as Ty not moving at full speed even though I have my analog stick pushed down all the way, for some reason the sound effects cut out while doing Julius's first training mission, and the game crashed as I was going around looking for opals in the beginning area of the game. On top of that, that camera is a bit of a pain when it comes to close quarters and jumping, best way I can put it is either I'm just bad keeping the camera undercontrol or it moves to far down when jumping? Not sure, was never they best at describing these things.Now aside from issues with the performance and glitches, the game is GREAT. As SOON as I heard the beat from the title screen I was INTO THIS GAME! And the sounds when performing specific actions just fit so well. On top of that, Ty 2's beginning mission is one of my favorites openings to a video game, and it just got an upgrade. *spoiler* when fighting the Demon Fluffies, the sounds and control of the battle mortar just fit. I LOVED it.So once the Devs get the bugs fixed, and I know they will :), this game is going to be even better than the first remake.

I only encountered 2 somewhat major issues with the game.Firstly, in the main game, I saw and talked to someone in a sewer area, and while in this area, the echo effect applied to the voices was a bit overkill making it hard to understand what the character was saying, especially without subtitles, and this effect stuck around for a bit even after I had exited the sewer into the outside world!Secondly, the Cart Racing game. While I find it an interesting distraction from the main game, the controls could definitely use some work, especially when powersliding.In fact, in the game's current state, the powerslide is not only cumbersome, but unnecessary, as when you turn your vehicle normally, you don't appear to lose any speed as in other Kart Racers such as Mario Kart or CTR.And when you do powerslide, the angle you turn at is practically 90 degrees, almost invariably sending you into the wall.Still, the rest of what I played of the game has me very excited for the full release!  For more of my thoughts, please check out my ""Work In Progress..."" episode on the game!https://youtu.be/smuvJ45kYV0"

If that was the case, it would have much more  potention. Now I think it is really a kids game. I wanted a Ratched & Clanck type of game that was available on Steam. It kinda is the same catagory, but just not as interesting. I am pretty soon bored when the graphics are bad. So this game won't last long I am afraid. I will recommend it, for kids."

I loved the music and the characters and the fighting back then, and once I saw that the first Ty game was ported to Steam, I was counting the days until they ported this game too.It took me about a day to beat the first mission when I was 13, but only about five minutes now that I'm 20. I've spent many nights dreaming of this game when I was a kid. Can't wait to see if the climb to Sly's treehouse thing is still as impossibly hard as it used to be.The only forseeable downside to this game is that I might beat it too fast."

Are they are as expertly crafted as mainstream platformers like Mario Galaxy? No. But they are fun little games with a lot of crazy charm.This one differs from the first game in that it has a more open-world feel, or at least that is what they are going for but it is still linear when you figure it out. Regardless, it does not have as clear of a ""hub"" world, and whether that is a good or bad thing is up to you. Also, you don't have to collect every single opal like in the first game. Opals are now currency for purchasing rangs, and your opals are tracked globally (not per-level). You don't need to grid for opals pretty much ever.The PC is lacking in 3D platformers, so I love that they have been porting the TY games. Even if it weren't a small market though, I would still recommend the TY games because they are just relaxing fun. You can tell the developers put some heart into the game."

Now it's back and better than ever, the devs are working hard making new improvements all the time, listening to user feedback. It's great to see this game the way Krome Studios originally wanted it to be but couldn't due to PS2 limitations and budget. I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys 3D platformers and it's a must have for anyone who played the original."
