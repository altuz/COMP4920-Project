Left4Dead was probably my last really passionate survival game(s) I spent way to much time playing. I am a 40 year old gamer and really don't get rattled by much. Let me just say, I was NOT prepared for how immersive this game was in VR. My very first play session lasted about a min, I got overwhelmed with Zombies and I actually said NOPE and took the headset off. I had to actually mentally prepare myself to go back into this game. I am having a BLAST, despite it being somewhat difficult for me at my current skill level. (can't seem to survive past that first real corner on the normal difficulty level, I really don't care, this game makes you want to keep playing. Highly recommended."

I almost gave this one a miss until someone posted an impassioned review of how much fun they had. Picked up Hordz and it is now one of my favorites. When demoing the Vive I usually bust out Hordz and so far all have excitedly enjoyed it. When ever I have people back over, Hordz always get a request for a return visit. It really is good fun. I'm still working at getting good enough to make it all the way through on hard. ♥♥♥♥ me the difficulty ramps up awesomely. The fact that the game has gotten some significant support after the fact and some cool little features (the zombies looking at you is creepy as hell) make this game easily worth the money.UPDATE: After ther latest patch this game is EVEN better.  Very worth the buy.  They online play works really well.  This weekend I was able to play Co-Op with a friend and some random people without issue.  Very fun to crank up the difficulty and play with others."

The play space moves, it's slow, so not terrible, but it's not great for more than 15mins play. Especially when looking in a different direction than the velocity is heading. FLoating disc under the player doesn't help also, it rotates with in your lower periphery.2. Audio is not spacialised, it gives no clues as to which direction zombies are in and how far away. The audio in general feels pretty weak.3. Weapon feels like it needs a 20 degree tilt to match how you would comfortably hold a vive controller and match other shooting games.4. Switching weapons is pretty awkward, grabing from over the shoulder would feel much nicer. Just because the controller has buttons doesn't mean you need to use them.5. Hit effects need some work, the animation and particle effects don't seem to fire on every hit. Makes weapons feel less real."

I received my Vive on Monday, 5/2/16 and spent a little time checking out the bundled software and The Lab, since it was free. From the moment I put on the headset I have been completely blown away by the VR experience. This stuff is really cool!! So after a few hours of time, spread out over a few days, checking out the free stuff I had, I decide to buy my first game. Out of the games on my wishlist I decided to go with HordeZ, on nothing more than wondering what it would be like to shoot some zombies on the Vive.I truly wasn't prepared for the experience I was about to have. LoL, To be frank, it scared the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me!! In a good way though, kind of like that haunted house scary during Halloween when you get frightened and then have a laugh. The first time I started, it startled me so bad I snatched the headset off and sat on my couch laughing at myself as I drank a beer and regrouped. Ok... Now I know what's up, let's do this! I strapped back in and went for round 2!!! If you'd like to see me make an♥♥♥♥♥out of myself, I recorded it on my phone and uploaded it. Be warned, I curse a lot. lolhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxrzfXpBlb4I just want to say that so far, this has been the defining VR experience for me. The immersion, presence, fear, nervousness, it was all SO REAL and I loved it. Watching videos just can't convey the feeling of being strapped in to this thing. It looked and felt so unbelievably real that I think I will no longer make comments about preparing for the zombie apocalypse because this game taught me that I'm a big scaredy cat!! lolGood job on this game guys. It looks great and plays really well. There were a few moments when the moving platform made my legs feel a little wobbly, but never really gave me any severe motion sickness. This mostly happened when the platform started or stopped.  I only mention that as an observation, not a complaint as it really wasn't a problem for me. But I know some people or more prone to the motion sickness thing!!10/10 Should probably put down puppy potty pads while playing this."

Game slowly moves you through the area on a floating pad, but you can still move around as much as you want in the size of the room you've dedicated to room scale VR, allowing you to physically dodge and run from zombies.-Graphics/sound are fantastic-You can either use guns/grenades and use a magnet gun to ""suck"" in ammo boxes as they fall around you, or (my favorite) you can just equip two katana swords to ninja your way through the area.-$15.99 is an absolute steal. I would have paid $50 for this game.The only possible improvement the developers could make is adding gamepad support so when the Virtuix Omni treadmill launches later this year, we can move about in the play area as far as we want to without worrying about hitting walls.A+!"

The multiplayer was easier to get a game in, whether its a problem with concurrent players being on or a problem with the multiplayer is only something the devs know (though in my experience its because of a problem with the multiplayer) It's not a problem for me to portforward, but it would be so much better if I could jump into a random game occasionally.And 2.)

Think Time crisis mixed with doom, if your a fan of the old on the rail arcade gun games then this will blow you away.  Graphics are incredible, the gameplay is smooth and when you pull out the pistols and drop a wave of enemies with headshots alone you will never want to stop playing. The maps are vastly different which i did not expect, from a more open backstreet to confined narrow corridors this game is a MUST for vive owners. My girlfriend actually broke down in tears after getting a fright playing this, true immersion.  Massive congrats to the DEV team, i hope you guys feel proud"

I thought the models were very detailed, the playstyle was arcade-ish but had enough realism to scare the s&*t out of me.  I only played for about 10 minutes before heading to bed tonight (HAD to write this before bed if that's any indication of the impression it left on me).I also always try to point out the good with the bad, and I'll say that it felt like switching between guns was a little clunky.  Your thumb needs to be directly over the item, rather than just in the quadrant where the item is.  My suggestion would be to make it an area selector, and not item selector.Aside from that, great game and worth every penny.  Buy it."

The pacing seems just about right, although at times the enemy spawn locations are not timed correctly and enemies spawn in unrealistic locations. I know it's a fantasy game so how could it be unrealistic? Well, if I have my back to the wall and an enemy spawns on top of me...I'd say that is unfair. I also played almost half the level with only 5 zombies attacking me. There are also glitches with zombies running thru the door of the first level. BTW, grenades work way better when thrown underhand. Is that a tracking issue?So... Things done well:Moving health level to controller is a great choice. When I first played this game I didn't even know it was on the floor. Having it on my controller is great. For added realism, could it be placed on the player's wrist, like a fake watch?Speed of platform is perfect.Sword play is a great feeling!!! Although I don't feel the zombies always react appropriately.Increased size of zombies is defintely more intimidating! Especially for shorter players.Current faults:A better way of incorporating rectangular play spaces to always be in line with the play space.When enemies get too close I see thru them instead of them stopping upon contact with me. When completely surrounded I sometimes have to shoot my self to kill them.Grenades don't always explode the portals. Is there a secret?The gear grabber sometimes gets stuck in the on postion, or lingers on even after I've switched weapons.Needs/Wants:I'd prefer the weapon select to be a simple swipe, not a swipe and a click.A better way of incorporating rectangular play spaces to always be in line with the majority of the level's hallways. For this game I turn the floor chaperone on so that I'm not banging my walls.I'd like the sword to continue to make impact even when an enemy is dead.Decapitation with sword would be awesome sauce!Can I shoot the knee caps! It would be great to stop the explosive zombie in its place and then explode at will later with a well timed shot.Health wrist watch as mentioned above."

There was also a level where i was floating above all the enemies for a time.  I'm sure the issues will be fixed.The game is worth the cost."

The trailer really doesn't do it justice.I was expecting a bland rail shooter experience, but with VR its so much fun. It's my first VR game that I look forward to playing again.My first play made me slightly sick. The slow moving ""rail"" messed with my head. I thought I wouldn't be able to play it, but I got used to it quickly. My 11 year old son actually couldn't handle it and turned on the VR sickness options (recently added FYI, note for some negative reviews), which are a nice alternative. Additionally, playing through again using the teleport option makes for a different play approach.My complaints/suggestions for improvement are- Audio. The monsters growls and foot steps seem to be one volume and its very, very difficult to determine which direction they come from. Big guys are sneaky quiet. Footstep sounds is horrible. So many footstep sounds overlapping it can sound like clapping.- Trackpad weirdness. Switching weapons feels bugged. Rarely does it switch to the item I want unless I'm looking at it. Menu at the end appears when pressing the touchpad, but doesn't actually work until you press the menu button. Continue button doesn't do anything (wrt end menu) and options of Quit and Exit are confusing.- Glitchy. Sometimes the shots go right through them. I emptied 3 clips into a floating skull without killing it.- I suck at throwing grenades. Hitting the big circle portals is harder than it seems it should be. Now I only throw underhand, it is more reliable. I've had many self kills with grenade bouncing and rolling back. (It's a literal skill based weapon, which I wouldn't complain about, but it difficult to learn and improve given the game timing and tension and the risk of it rolling back and ending your game.)- Swords and room space. Swords are dangerous in the room space if you swing them. I know this limitation and can adapt, but I wish I could disable them or something. Inexperienced players end up swinging erratically and the room bounds don't handle this well.- End game statistics take too long to animate. Just show them or let me skip it.These are small issues though, in a game I have thoroughly enjoyed and loot forward to playing more."

As someone who suffers from motion sickness in real life quite easily, I had no problems with the movement in this game. Floating over the stairs was a bit odd, but not enough to cause me any problems. I actually liked the movement as you got to explore a lot more area than say Brookhaven, where you just stand still. Going down a darkened hallway with doors coming up on both sides, not knowing what will pile out of them really was great, as they will come at you from all sides. Played both and had a lot more fun with Hordz. I've only played the first 2 levels, so I have more to play. Well worth the $12 price tag. Highly recommended."

Also, the tractor beam gun is quite flaky, so I spend a fair amount of time trying to pick up dropped ammo and heath.

My first experience of the game was terrifying:-The zombies are BIG. They loom over you.-The zombies are fast. They sprint to get close before they slow down to a walk and flash their teeth/flesh inches in front of your face. This allows them to quickly get behind you for a good scare when you are distracted.-The environment is dark and creepy. You look around and you aren't in your house with your friends anymore. You feel alone and nearly helpless.Honestly, it's difficult for me to find the strength play this game. I often end up quitting before the zombies get too close. Even when I know it's just a game and I stay calm, something about the presence of the zombies in VR gives me a feeling of dread that I've never felt before; my ""fight or flight"" response goes haywire and I need to get out of it.Here's a list of things I think this game needs in it's current state of developement:-Larger, prominent blood effects. It's difficult to tell where I'm shooting the zombies. Proper blood effects would let me see how accurate I am.-Improved weapon models/animations. I want to feel like I'm shooting real guns.-A game mode where the world is brightly lit and colorful and the zombies are replaced by teddy bears and only come from one direction. Please."

There's just something extremely satisfying about a zombie shooting gallery.I get that everyone is different when it comes to motion sickness / vertigo, but I had absolutely no problem with the extremely slow movement.  It moves slow enough to not upset gameplay (ie:  you can't just race to the exit), but fast / often enough to keep the environment fresh.  Controls took me a while (3 or 4 rounds) to get used to, but I prefer the current weapon switching to any over the shoulder ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  Right now I can grab ammo out of the air and switch back to a pistol without bothering to look at all.The only real complaint I have so far is the grenades bounce too much.The only bugs I have experienced are:1 -  level 7 in the generator room - i start getting black textures and soon can't see even zombies.  (Reproduceable - fix this please devs, I have a 980ti and am not used to having textures not drawing).2 - zombie which won't take damage other than a grenade (but has his eyeball fly off a dozen times as I empty a clip into his face)As for the naysayers:You CAN adjust the tilt (maybe this is new, or maybe someone didn't bother reading the options)You likely can't see tracers sometimes because of muzzle flash (i've seen it every time otherwise)I agree the disc is lame, but hardly a show stopperI can hear what direction zombies are coming from just fine.  Sometimes they take a long path to get to you, but If you want to complain about audio, why not riff on the fact that the fat zombie makes no sound at all?$18 CAD is a bit high, but worth it in my opinion."

With 8 levels and a ""last stand"" that can all be replayed at half a dozen different difficulty levels, it takes awhile to try all possible combinations at least once. Then there is the replay value of trying to improve your rank on the leader boards. It is just cool beyond words having the undead coming at you from all angles as you move through he board. They will actually startle you at times when they sneak up on you. The latest updates have addressed a lot of issues mentioned in previous reviews - I find the new weapon selection system a significant improvement over the old once you get used to it, it has additional options for movement if the ""coveyor belt"" style movement bothers you (I am prone to motion sickness, but this game does not bother me at all - it just makes me feel like I am still moving after I stop playing if I have been playing for more than 30 minutes - like feeling like you are still on a boat once you get off), and the collision detection and invisible wall issues in earlier versions seem to have been corrected.I am really hoping they come out with more levels or a sequel. I would pay for a good DLC level pack, as what is already included is 100% worth the $15.If I had to suggest any improvements for this version, I would love to see more variety in point values for things like long shots or catching them while they are still running, and more variety in zombie character models and/or animations. But those changes would just be icing on an already delicious cake."

You slowly move along creepy backdrops with zombies attacking you from all directions, big ones, little ones, explodey ones. Until it brings you to the level goal. Kind of like a super plodding ""House of the dead"" but the zombies are actually shuffling into your personal space. It handles the VR movement issue well as the ""on the rails"" mechanic just melts into the background when battle commences. Allowing you to go crazy capping zombies by dual weilding a decent selection of arms including melee for close quarters. I love how fun melee with dual kantanas in VR is, so you can play out your walking dead fantasies and feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥This game is untimately let down by the weapon selection controls, but this is beyond the devs control as there simply arent enough useful buttons on the Vive controller for decent hardcore gaming. That means its either the track pad (yuck) or flailing in the air for weapon selection. As you would expect this sucks and is frustratingly the reason for ""game over"" other than bad ammo management or lack of aiming skill, sigh -_- Valve just love their trackpads when an actual button would work so much better.Still, it's fun, lets you pop on your own music for an undead battle and gives you a katanna. Definately worth the price of admission and is the best shooter on Vive right now, but with Brookhaven's release imminent that title could be up for grabs before long.Get it while its hot...smelly and decacying."

I have only had my Vive a few days (well, 1 1/2 to be exact, as I refused to buy one until it was available without the ridiculous shipping charges) and this was the first shooter I really tried.So.. start the game, and wait for the load. Next thing I know, I am in a corridor, and can hear moaning (and not in a good way). It gets closer, and theres nothing there. I start looking round, and realise theres a 6 foot zombie behind me who wants nothing more than to eat my brains. WAAAH!!! Shoot zombie! Shoot next zombie!A surround game takes a bit of dealing with, after playing on a monitor, but after a minute or so it feels completely natural.  I made it round a corner, and ended up being swarmed. At which poiint a sword appeared, and it was slash, slash slash like an idioy hoping I could make it. Hits came in from everywhere- try to shoot a zombie in th eface but no, out of ammo- and I died. I admit I closed my eyes till it was over :)was it fun? oh hell yes! A dark atmosphere, lumbering zombie that just felt like they were real, and eventually figuring out how to get ammo (dont shoot it, use the middle gun on the selector) made it a bit better. OK, a LOT better!The GoodMore a reflection on the vive, but the immersive atmosphere makes this a totally different experience to anything I have tried before. It really feels like you are being attacked- or chased- or eaten alive.Amosphere again- the devs have given us a wonderful feeling of those dark, dank places that have haunted us forever. It captures the feeling of being alone, then swamps it with ""Oh god I am not alone- I really, really wish I was!""Weapons- they work. Not in the sense of shooting, but they feel right. Selection is easy (technically) but when things get frantic, trying to change over is the hardest thing to do. It gives you the real sense of panic that you need.Enemies- so far, they work. That little bit more time aiming for the headshot gives you a greast feeling of satisfaction that you crave, as opposed to the spray and pray that seems to be everywhere these days.Simplicity - yup, simplicity. No complicated mechanics, no endless go here, do that goals, just a straightfoward shoot, shoot shoot. It gives you what you want- and it does it well.the Bad.Let out a little bit of wee on the first playthrough and had to change my trousers :)replayability - its going to get a bit old after a while, but at the same time, does it really matter? Headshotting zombies is ALWAYS fun, and playing over a level you know lets you prep for the next wave.Overall, I love it so far. Any game where you play and think its 5 minutes later, only to find out its an hour, is value for money. Will I keep playing? Absolutely!"

Technically, everything as a guest in a coop game a is a little janky, but that's easy to look past if you aren't too picky. From a gameplay perspective, it's a lot less stressful having a friend watching your back in, and that's a good thing.Coop is frenetic, fun, and exciting. Me and my friend will have each of us take two directions to watch and hope we don't get overwhelmed. The game is challenging on it's easiest setting and that's not a bad thing, as it leaves you with stuff to come back to.Price-wise, it's about perfect at it's sale price of $15.99. Unfortunately a lot of the bugs in this game feel like an early access title, but the price sort of makes up for that.Honestly, if you have a friend to coop with don't pass this game up. Here are my few issues with the game that stem from coop.Coop bugs:-When logging into game it assigns you an IP address. This is pulled from your gateway, which is often the same as other users. For my friend and I to play together one of us had to edit our IP address. This also doesn't save and you have to do it each time you close the game.-Models are almost always in the seated position in coop, but if you shoot the air above a player it will still hurt them.-Models don't hold their guns, they are floating in front of them-Animations for models basically doesn't exist, it just snaps to a few random positions.-The gun that allows you to suck in ammo doesn't work consistently when joining a game-Shots have a delay when joining a coop game."

There is something so primal and satisfying about dual wielding a pair of machine guns while utterly obliterating an onslaught of zombies in a tight hallway. The guns feel hefty and powerful. It's a rail shooter, so think House of the Dead. It's really nice to focus entirely on killing, and not waste time trying to plan an escape route. The zombies arrive in packs of ten or so, which is spectacular when you want to Rambo things up a bit. The multiplayer may be the best thing about this game. When you Rocket and Groot your way through an ambush while you both laugh maniacally and spray death, you'll get what I mean. Okay, so it isn't the prettiest game at the prom, but dammit, once you make eye contact, you'll learn that it isn't all about looks.

After the wave based shooters that get boring after a few rounds, due to repetition and seeing the same environment over and over again, I was worried if we wouldn't see something break the mold and bring us something new and refreshing.  Fear not for that game is here!  When I first think of the term ""Vive on-rail shooter"", I think ""bring your barf bag"" but these developers were smart and came up with an ingenious way to work around vertigo: move VERY slowly.You move at a walking pace and it doesn't cause ANY motion sickness at all.  Given the context of the game - a zombie apocalypse - it makes sense that you'd be walking slowly too.  Even if each level amounts to 10 minutes of walking down a few hallways and killing waves of zombies as they spawn from predetermined points (and a few other enemy types thrown in for good measure), it's a breath of fresh air to constantly be seeing new terrain and feeling like you're heading towards a goal other than ""get the highest score"".Each of the 3 levels i've played so far have had a unique look, none of them wear out their welcome, and I constantly feel like I'm moving forward so I don't get that ""Damn, died at wave 2.  I think i'm done with this for today"" feeling.  This is a step in the right direction and it feels good to play.  The weapon selection menu, one you get use to it, is very snappy and the game got a couple good startles out of me when zombies would catch me off guard because I didn't pay attention to my rear for too long.  Ultimately, I wouldn't say that this is a very scary game.  Instead, it's just a fun time killing zombies.I'm definitely looking forward to playing more and putting in some multiplayer time (which seem slike it would be a blast).Kudos."

You move slowly(though you can teleport instead if the motion makes you sick) through an indoor map and kill zombies and other undead as they come at you from the various hallways. That the enemies come at you in ""lanes"" with an audio noise before they start at you makes this game work very well. It makes it so you have to react on multiple angles of attack, but you don't feel like things are all over the place out of control.The enemies are also fairly well varied with a decent selection of levels and difficultly. I think the game strikes a very good balance on enemy variety, difficultly, giving you ""oh crap"" moments without overwhelming you and letting you feel like a badass as you go all gun kata on zombies.On the down side the UI needs work yet. Weapon selection is pretty bad to where I died more often to mis-selecting a grenade than I did to enemies. Also multiplayer looks to be pretty much a mess at the moment.But flaws aside, the game feels like something you can come back to time and again for some casual gun play on the easier modes or an all out gore fest on the harder modes.

Shooting them triggers a generic flinch animation regardless of where or how you hit them, chunks of some grey stuff comes off when shooting them but the model doesn't change, and the sword does not react to their body at all besides their head (which causes them to explode into different colored chunks of random bodies).There is very little content and what little content there is quite frankly looks horrible and isn't fun.

Unfortunately, from the last update, this game has just fallen so far from where it stood.  They have tried some good things, but it just feels like there isn't enough forethought, or there just isn't enough experience with developing a game, because it's just turned into a garbled mess.  I've played multiplayer matches, trying to have conversations, but because there is no way to lower the game volume, or raise the communication volume seperately, as soon as action happens, you won't be able to hear the other players.Many cases of monsters being up on the level above you, as if the monsters think your character is up there, causing piles of monsters to stack.  While it is entertaining when they eventually find where you are at, but odds are, those monsters will either destroy you, or you are shooting so frantically, your chance of getting a good score is almost nil.  The tractor gun is broken in multiplayer as well, working about 10% of the time.  While the developer tried to fix this by allowing you to shoot your ammo, they put a mechanic in where using the tractor gun nets you more points.  So they know it's a system that doesn't work, but they reward you for trying to use it?  What?A single player experience works decent on this, but for me personally, gets boring, fast.  Upping the difficulty to try and make it more exciting only falls flat on it's face for most levels.  They tend to start off with multiple entry points, and when you set it 4 or higher, you quickly get overwhelmed, once again removing your chance of getting a good score.This game is great in concept, but implementing half-baked ideas is not going to get this game anywhere, soon to be forgotten in the piles of wave-based shooters."

So much fun.DId I say to go buy this? Please. You will not regret.I can't fathom how you would not like this game.

Let's get this ball rolling and let the world know VIVE is here and here to stay. VR is here and here to stay.Update again: This is in response to whatever negative reviews are out there. For $15 this game is well worth it even with whatever quirks you may find. The game is not broken except in the net work connection area occasionally and that is being addressed. I mean what do people expect from games like this? It is an arcade shooter basically so every hit won't be exact and sometimes you will get swamped. Who cares? That is what makes it challenging. Are people so unintelligent these days that they can't find ways to beat the game and work around the quirks? It is one thing if coding makes the game boring and easy but another if you can still finish a level with some annoyances that make the game harder. Everyone wants free and easy these days. I am very happy with the VR community right now and how receptive they are. They all deserve good ratings for their efforts to get us games out as fast as they did. Yes a few VR games may be trash but this game is not one of them. That is my thoughts whether they are worth reading or not. If you have an issue then just send a message to the devs. They are listening but at the same time if something needs a fix then that may take some time. I am still having a blast with this game.

The weapon selection device is a pain (and has to be seen to be used), and I frequently selected the wrong weapon multiple times.Enemy design is not good.  The basic zombies come in so few models that it feels like shooting up a clone army.  Monsters run up to you until they are a couple of metres away, then start a slow shuffle, which is obviously for balance purposes but looks totally artificial. The dynamic damage systems are nowhere near as good as L4D. Also, your character floats a bit off the ground, which makes all the zombies look much smaller than you, negating much of the scariness VR can bring.It's really annoying, because there's the shell of a fun game here.

,Not Recommended,412050,23244864,"Posted: 27 May, 2016",all,i208khonsu,"There's a lot to like about this game, but there are so many bad decisions which were made that I'm having to force myself to play through it.Benign issue, the Katina when held in the left hand is upside down. Please fix!There appears to be a few decisions which were somewhat corrected in the latest release.First it appears that the game slowly moves you forward through the levels by default. An automatic teleport option has been added that apparently keeps pace with the auto forward mechanic. This is substantially better, however I constantly run into instances where the game teleports me in the middle of a legion of zombies. There's also a blinding flash when this happens which makes it very hard to figure out how you've been teleported, what direction your facing, and where all the zombies are. This should really only happen when a player chooses it to happen, or after the current zombie wave has been killed off.Secondly the default weapon selection is rather bad. When pressing the trackpad a number of bubbles appear around the controller and you need to move your controller into that bubble to pick up the weapon. It's similar to Hover Junkers of those to know, but is worse. The much better option has you selecting weapons in a pie menu on the trackpad. This is similar to Space Pirate Trainer, but not as good. I've tried to choose the center option by just tapping the trackpad, but it never works. It seems you need to rub your finger around and then release. You also can't run your finger off the edge of the trackpad (like SPT) or the menu is apparently canceled. There is no audio or force feedback when selecting a weapon either. Worst of all, the shotgun is inaccessible with this option.Speaking of the center weapon, the tractor beam, I don't really understand why this item exists. The tractor beam solely exists to magically grab items which magically pop out of dead zombies. An item this magical seems very out of place with everything else in this game. I'm not sure why the decision was made to have this instead of of allowing you to just shoot the item like you can in games like House of The Dead or Time Crisis which this game is mimicking in VR. What is even more puzzling is that you loose points for shooting these pickup. You'd think you'd get bonus points for electing to not pick up ammo and powerups. It's not like you'd shoot this on accident. The frequency of drops is also so often that when combined with the finicky nature of weapon selection it basically means you need to have it out all the time; eliminating dual weapon usage to only once you've played the game multiple times and know exactly whats about to happen. It's a real bummer.The combination of picking up items with the poor weapon selection really takes a lot of the fun out of this game.That said, there's clearly only one weapon you should ever use unless you run out of ammo with it; the pistol. Not only does it do more damage than any other weapon, but you also score bonus points for racking up consecutive headshots. The assault rifle is incapable of doing this due to it's recoil, you can't select the shotgun with the better weapon selection, the katana is too short to kill anything without you being injured and the grenade can't headshot.The grenades are however good for scoring bonus points on ""portals"" which you only know about if you read the convoluted starting lobby. The grenades however don't make any sound, just a flash of fire and splattering body parts if you hit anybody. Same goes for the exploding zombies.That said the sound that the game does have is rather good. Many games have poor 3D positional audio, but this is one of the rare areas which the game excels at. There are no weapon swap sounds, there are no hit sounds, there are no damage sounds, there are no explosion sounds, weapon fire is generic, all zombies sound are generic; however the positional audio is quite nice.Catch is, a lot of people like this game; I don't know why. There's something here that could be improved into a good game, but I think that would involve destroying a lot of the game which a lot of people seem to like. Good for them I suppose. Personally I would not recommend this game. Play The Brookhaven Experiment demo instead, if that doesn't catch you fancy then wait for another zombie game, if you don't want to wait I guess you buy HordeZ."

You cannot move by your own.You transport automatically with a little bit motion sickness. The 20€ doesn´t hurt, but i don´t want to play it again.In the meantime there was no update to make the game better."

Often while playing I would experience a disjoint between my eyes and inner ear that made me feel like I was going to fall over. I have not really experience VR sickness before but this is the closest I have come. For someone that is susceptible to motion sickness I would stear clear of this one until perhaps the Auto teleporting is in place.

Haven't played a multi-player game yet but looking forward to it. Single player is back to it's former best. Haven't play on all the levels yet but so far so good. Pew pew pew. Die Zombie die.(I don't normally leave reviews but since the last release this game had become unplayable. It's gone from my favourite game in VR to my least. I'm now lucky if I get to play a round in either multi player or single without it crashing. If the game does actaully get past the main menu and I get into a round (single or ""multi"") I don't always get any weapons. This is probably lucky since there aren't any Zombies to kill either.On the odd occasion that I can choose a weapon as soon as I select anyting it jumps back to the mneu screen and then I can't get any further. Boot game - crash, re-boot - menu - nothing, re-boot - menu - crash, re-boot - start round - crash. Get the picture?)I understand that this is a game in progress but the devs seems to have gone backwards rather than forwards.  A solid three thumbs down untl a fix goes in to sort out the current issues."

I'm still on the next to lowest difficulty level and am being challenged quite a bit.  There is some nice strategy too with picking up the ammo/health as well. It creeps me out quite a bit but I've become addicted to the adrenaline rush.  Haven't tried multiplayer yet but feel it is worth it just for the single player trainer and missions.

These kind of shooters are typical, but currently what the medium does best.Great atmosphere, directional sounds, reasonable graphics.One of the few locomotion systems without teleport that doesn't make me sick.  Stairs feel a little odd however floating down them on a platform.Levels aren't particularly interesting, I feel that a lot more could have been done for variety, elevators, shooting from a vehicle, all sorts is possible with what they have here.Great for the money if you like zombie shooters, In my opinion it playes better than the 'wave' style tower defence shooters like brookhaven."

It's not very deep and there's no sense of progression since everything is unlocked at the start, but it's a fun zombie shooter that's great for killing time.  Some areas are very dark and zombies ambush you from all sides, so you should be able to handle some jumps/scares.The devs have been updating fairly regularly which is nice as well.Pros:-Graphics are pretty good-Gunplay feels fairly satisfying-Zombies could use some graphical enhancement, but overall the mood & look of the game is great-Plenty of game customization and difficulty levels-Mowing through different types of zombies trying to eat your face off in VR is an exhilarating experienceCons:-Grenade throwing physics are atrocious, I either blow myself up trying to land them in the portals or throw it 20 feet past zombies every time-The shotgun seems to have a range of like 1 foot, it's not even worth equipping-The tip of the sword doesn't seem to kill zombies, they have to be closer to the center of the sword-Game needs some sort of introduction, even just a 1-2 minute walkthrough of the mechanics/weapons would be niceOther:-Dead zombies love to glitch out and slide on the ground which needlessly spooks me lol-I've never seen another soul on multiplayer-Took me a while to figure out that all ammo is shared, and the ammo indicator on the assault rifle wasn't immediately apparent"

Yes, it has a lot of bugs and things that needs to be fixed ASAP, and It still feels as an unfinished product that still need’s a lot of work, but the experience especially when playing co-op is so immersive and awesome that you almost don’t mind all the issues it has.So, here’s a list for what needs to be implemented \ fixed in the game in my opinion:1. Microphone support for push-to-talk in multiplayer\co-op. (MUST-HAVE FEATURE!)2. Bug - The player avatar permanently crouching while playing multiplayer\co-op.3. Bug - Sometimes monsters glitch above the ceiling.4. Better interface for playing multiplayer\co-op (right now when you create LAN game it starts the game immediately even when your friends didn’t joined yet).5. Can’t pause the game in multiplayer\co-op. (MUST-HAVE FEATURE!)6. Friendlier user interface and menu interface (the menu to change weapons\pause the game etc…)Edit: After the #6 update this game is awful, it’s really a shame and I’m very upset about this! They Removed LAN support in the last update and now they want money for the ""advanced Commercial license"" that will support LAN support!? Seriously? It's outrageous and totally unfair and I bought 5 copies of this game because of the LAN support, they never said they will remove it before. I changed my review and gave Thumbs down just because of this awful update.The developers need a much better Communication with the community and it's really not ok that they just remove content from the game (Like LAN support) without any notice.Once they change \ fix all the issues and bring back LAN support I’ll change my review.Edit: There are still many issues to the game, like, there's no shotgun in the 2D weapons UI and some more (I posted everything I found on the forums).But they (basically him, it’s a one man show – one dude created this awesome game) just added LAN support and fixed the voice-chat issue, so I’m bringing back the thumbs up!Thanks a lot, and I hope you will fix all the other issues of the game ASAP."

If I were introducing someone to VR games, who has never experienced VR before, then I would probably let them have a crack at this one first. There isn't much of a learning curve.The belt, upon which are your weapons (you have to touch them to select one), is hard to see if you have a big belly like me."
