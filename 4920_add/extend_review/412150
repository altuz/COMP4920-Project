,Recommended,412150,31374261,Posted: 26 April,all,Fauxy,"Midsummer Nightis a short adventure game about a boy trying to save his sister after she's been kidnapped by what seems to be a bear. Along the way he has fairytale-esque episodes where he encounters various creatures from Russian mythology. I'm feeling a little uninspired writing this synopsis, because I feel like while I recommend the game as a whole, it is fairly underwhelming especially in comparison to some similar titles on Steam.My biggest problem with it is the weak writing, which of course is partially due to the fact that the work is translated from Russian. But even disregarding that (one of my favorite games studios is the also Russian Ice-Pick Lodge, infamous for their debut game's game breakingly bad translation and how people loved it despite that), the game has a lot of strange choices in how it presents information. One that I can't comprehend is that it includes narration in red text in the dialogue boxes describing the physical attributes of characters who the player can already see plain as day because this isn't a text adventure. Even when it's describing things that aren't obvious it seems quite off the ball. Is there any real way that literally saying ""No human talks like that!"" is going to enhance my experience of a character who is meant to be otherworldly, who looks otherworldly, and whose speech pattern is already somewhat otherworldly?This doesn't help me build any attachment to the story, I certainly was not particularly shocked by any of the twists or moved by anything that happened in the story because it often just felt like I was passing through the game from point A to B. And I mean, it's not like the puzzles in this are that challenging.A personal nitpick is that I don't think I'm a big fan of this kind of running tour of folkloric creatures and dilemmas structure that has been popularized by nordic (Finnish, Norwegian) game companies. It feels a lot less like the story has been structured to give the character's journey struggle and meaning and more like you're crossing off a list of Must See Monsters from an article you got off Buzzfeed.Despite everything, my final verdict is:Midsummer Nightis acceptable, playable, kind of enjoyable, but not exceptional. Though I will say I got this game for very cheap (less than half a dollar) and I'm not sure I would feel the same way if I had paid full price."

The lore is so enthralling despite how vague it is. Though I usually hate when media breaks the fourth wall, I found the way in which this game did it quite charming. I struggled figuring out some of the puzzles, but its not because they were overly hard, I was just missing the obvious. There were 2 points where I really didn't understand what it was I was doing wrong, but I was about to figure it out eventually on my own.I actually played this game as a live stream, and am uploading to youtube.There's still so much for me to do and the adventures Klim finds himself on are so random and strange. I felt this game emotionally, at some points I was creeped out, some points heartbroken. And I have yet to finish the game! No spoilers, if you play you'll see these emotional points for yourself.In my opinion, this game is well worth the $5 I spent on it (and yes, I did pay for it), and  am hoping to do a full video review once I finish streaming this game.~~Nugua Plays. <3"
,Recommended,412150,23655943,"Posted: 19 June, 2016",all,Hämärän matkamies,"Midsummer Night tells a tale about two siblings and what happened to them during one specific midsummer night a long time ago, in a setting that reminds ancient Russia with some elements of Russian folklore.Game itself is a pixelated top-down adventure game where you control main character, brother Klim and lead him through dense forests and other suitably atmospheric places collecting items, encountering some interesting characters and solving some puzzles and mini games along the way.First of all, there is no in-game graphic or resolution options. You can switch between full screen and windowed mode with Alt + Enter and you can change colour saturation with PageUp and PageDown buttons, but that's pretty much it. You can also toggle sound on and off in-game menu but there is no way to adjust sound level.There is no speech in-game, only text and the writing is in general very good, albeit in places a little bit rough around the edges. But overall writing fits with the narrative and although there is some fourth wall breaking in Klim's monologue and couple of intentional anachronisms, story and characters take themselves serious enough.As mentioned before, you take the role of the brother and lead him through the game world. This happens either by WASD, arrow keys or numpad. Movement is responsive and fast enough for the purposes of the game. The world of Midsummer Night is linear with limited chances (or need) for backtracking although there is some choices you can make in certain points of the game.Game itself is sadly rather short: According to Steam I have played about 5 hours and in that time I managed to complete it once. 5 hours mainly because I wanted to take my time, read dialogues and enjoy the atmosphere and partly because I was stuck with a certain puzzle over an hour, because I'm an idiot... What, there is an in-game hint system,  no no, who needs that, ha ha! Not me (in all honesty, in that point I had forgotten that the whole hint system even existed)! Relative shortness of course makes it easier to play the game again and try different choices.All in all I do recommend Midummer Night to all who are interested in touching and beautiful fairytales, Russian folklore and adventure games with some replay value."

The soundtrack is perfect, the fairy-tale feel of the story made me play far longer than I intended, and poking that tree in the eye is so satisfying.While not a long game, this one really didn't need to be. It's the perfect length for what it is. Puzzles were perfectably reasonable to solve (bird woman took me some time, but I worked it out eventually).A+: Would revive frog again."

,Recommended,412150,26588538,"Posted: 13 November, 2016",all,Sezz,Its a very short but sweet game with little horror. I am surprised with the way they created the fairy tale atmosphere using mere pixel graphics. I got this game for 25 Indian Rupees. Its a Thumbs up from me. I recommend this game for the ones looking for foresty/flowery atmosphere.
,Recommended,412150,30971800,Posted: 5 April,all,BPDsauce,"WOW! This game was outstanding! This was a great point-and-click style adventure game (minus the point-and-clicking) with challenging but not too obtuse puzzles, gorgeous art, and serene, atmospheric music. I can't help but be amazed by this short and sweet little game. Now that I've beaten it once, I need to go back and find all the secret alternate paths.My only critique would be a few translation errors, but honestly, any gramatical mistakes just added to the overall appeal and atmosphere of a uniquely cultural game.To the developers, Thank You so much, and please continue making games."

The story dips into facets of Russian folktales that I enjoyed, having no experience with them prior to playing. The English translation isn't perfect, but at best you don't notice and at worst you can understand what it's getting at without too much difficulty. No critical information is lost or obscured by the translation.At some points in the game it can be a little unclear what to do next, but from my experience playing through it three times there aren't any points where you can become outright stuck. There's also a built in hint system, and you're generally confined to a handful of screens for any given puzzle, which helps limit how lost you can become and how many things you have to work through to figure out where to go and what to do next to advance the story.Overall its an enjoyable and unique game that I'm glad I stumbled across."

However, this is one of the best games that I have ever played. The graphics are absolutly beautiful and the story is enchanting. The soundtrack is also very nice and fits the story well. The multiple endings and paths also make the game very replayable.  The storyline is based on Russian folk tails but even without any knowlage of these storys it is easy to follow. The avalible language is in both Russian and English and the creator translated it very well into English. with no major grammatical errors.TL;DRVery good game for the price. Great design and story. Would easly recommend to everyone."

But good.It is very brief, it may only take about 1.5 hours. Haha ignore the fact that my time clocked me at 11 hours, I had the game running while I did other things.
