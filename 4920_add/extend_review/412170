,Recommended,412170,34368209,Posted: 20 August,all,ρоѕιтяои_,"City Of Chains is a dark sci-fi adventure title developed by Astronomic Games and published by New Reality Games. As Holt Allaway, you take control of a small group of escaped fugitives and attempt to lead them to their freedom. Along the ensuing adventure you will have to make many decisions, some of them with far reaching consequences, such as whether to fight or to avoid combat, to help others or to look out strictly for yourselves and finally to show mercy or to kill. Decide wisely because your choices could possibly affect everyone in the city...""A City Of Chains"".Aside from the intriguing story, the superb gameplay is also a standout feature of this fantastic Indie title. Instead of the traditional experience points you earn skill points which can then be used to learn a variety of new skills and useful passive bonuses for each character on your team. From combat and dialogue skills, to explosive and medicinal crafting, there are many abilities at your disposal to enhance the success of your group but choose wisely depending on your particular style of play. The combat is turn-based and strategic giving you time to determine and execute your teams actions then quickly switching to the adversaries turn until one side eventually emerges from battle victorious. As far as the objectives go, there are non-linear and semi-linear locations so there is usually an alternate means to and end. Also remember that choice and consequence matter in City Of Chains as your decisions will have an impact on the world and people around you. For example, in order to escape from some facility undetected do you shoot this unsuspecting guard dead or merely knock him out? And if you should chose the latter and cross paths with him again in the future will he in turn help you or try to kill you? These are some of the moral decisions that you must make throughout the gripping narrative.Visually, well City Of Chains is a RPGMaker title and we all know what those look like because they typically have a similiar visual style no matter which game it is because that's just the nature of the software. However, City Of Chains is like a RPGMaker title on steroids because it actually looks quite different from any other game in the category that I've come across on Steam. I believe the main difference, at least to me, is that this title doesn't have the ""anime"" or ""cartoony"" look of your average RPGMaker title and has opted for a more realistic visual style especially when it comes to character design. Graphically the title is absolutely fantastic and is also without a doubt the best looking RPGMaker game out there hands down. From the set pieces to the character portraits in the cutscene dialogue, everything looks terrific. With that said, the title retains a dark and dreary look color-wise probably due to the bleak nature of the narrative which fits perfectly in my opinion. Also of note, the sound quality is excellent whether it's gameplay, ambient background noises or the dystopian flavored musical score which is superb I might add. In summary, the sleek graphical style and wonderful audio really compliment the great combat and excellent narrative in this title.City Of Chains is definitely the best RPGMaker title that I've played on Steam even going so far as to knock my previous favorite ""Skyborn"" off the throne. The dark sci-fi setting, compelling narrative, non-linear gameplay and wonderful turn-based strategic combat come together to create quite the exciting adventure. There are three difficulty modes-Casual, Hardy, Dystopia and given the number of weapons and skills to select for your team as well as the many decisions to be made throughout the story the replay value of this game is quite high. Option-wise there are Steam Achievements and Steam Trading Cards to collect and although the great soundtrack is not available as an extra option you can, thankfully, find the tracks in the game files so they are completely free and readily available. In just a short time I have fallen in love with this soundtrack as it is really good. In summary, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND City Of Chains to R.P.G., Strategy and Cyberpunk fans as well as anyone looking to go on a great adventure in a dystopian futurisic setting where choice actually matters in the storyline."

,Recommended,412170,23228977,"Posted: 26 May, 2016",all,Muuro,"Having currently completed about roughly 3/4ths of the game so far, I'd have to say the narrative feels a bit lacking.  It's very much like Deus Ex in the setting, but I don't feel the story or characters are much more than average.  However what sets this game apart from others is the fact that it takes chances in other areas, notably gameplay.Not many RPG's don't give you the standard levelups.  What I mean by standard is that killing enemies grants you experience and at certain experience amounts you gain levels which increase your base stats and unlock skills and attacks.  No, rather this game takes a cue from the original Deus Ex in that you gain skill points for completing objectives (or tasks as the game calls them).  You use the skill points to buy skills for a character.  The character has a certain set of skills to choose from, and you get to choose which one you would like unlocked.  Certain skills also unlock the ability to gain other skills.  Not many RPG's use this type of system, which is a shame as it offers greater depth and customization.There are also multiple paths that can be taken through levels as well as choices to be made throughout the game.  I can't say for sure how the choices affect the ending, but it seems like you may get the three base endings no matter what.  Perhaps though small things change in each one depending on other choices, that will be interesting.There's a lot of good about this game.  I wish the story could be a bit better, but it's a solid effort to put forth something new and different."

It does things I wish every RPG would do, like having fixed encounters which are actually different instead of just endless filler chaff, and awarding skill points for exploration/progression instead of grinding. It has a few faults you would expect for a game made on a non-AAA budget, but none so big they would prevent me from recommending. Great value at less that ten bucks!"

76561198029904609,Recommended,412170,24623193,"Posted: 30 July, 2016",all,bear_storm,"Maybe I've spent too much time in the RPGmaker ghetto, but City of Chains was legitimately fun to play. It's not perfect by any measure, or even really polished. The graphics look like they've been run through a third-party-Sega-Saturn-game filter and the major characters are all matched with awful kludge-y 3D portrait art. The game starts abruptly and for a long moment teeters on the edge of being terrible.And then, somehow, it grabs itself by its own bootstraps and pulls its body into the air.English doesn't feel like City of Chains' first language, but it speaks grunge effortlessly. If you liked the low-fi oppressive future of either Deus Ex or Shadowrun, you'll feel at home here, even if that home is a low-income tenement with no heat and used needles in the hallway outside.Most of the beats that CoC hits are fairly tired ones (oppressive government, crime everywhere, chips in peoples' heads that control their thoughts, etc), but where the game genuinely shines is in the branching paths of its narrative. It's only about five hours from start to finish, which is about three hours more than I expected it to be, but that time is packed full of choices and a startling number of them either came back to haunt me or were part of a long chain of inter-related decisions that stretched the length of the plot. The game culminates in three very distinct endings, each with its own dungeon and plotline, and each accepting input from your previous decisions.The two I played both had me make a moral call mid-ending, and neither punished me unjustly for making the ""wrong"" decision.In fact, never once did I feel like City of Chains was treating me unfairly. The game doesn't offer good and evil so much as different flavors of pragmatism, and all of them felt valid. By that same token, combat on normal mode requires planning and provisioning and kept my resources pretty tight, but I was still able to build a team of unstoppable deathbeasts by the final chapter. That's a fine balance to finesse, and I applaud it.The characters are generally pretty flat, little more than moving setpieces, but they do feel distinct from each other. Each gets an upgradable skill that changes the way they interact with the world, and in one case this meant getting regular dialog popups in battle that, depending on my choice, gave me mechanical benefits.For all its stock art and tired assets, City of Chains is a well-designed game. It doesn't try to overstretch itself, but it doesn't fall short of expectations either. The way it handles decisions puts it ahead of some AAA titles (Mass Effect 3), even if it lags way behind them in every other possible way.This was really a pleasant surprise to playthrough, even if it wasn't a bargain bin miracle (like Dark Scavenger).This is definitely worth a couple of dollars if the graphics don't make your face hurt terribly."

Along the way he meets a few companians and is eventually faced with difficult decisions that will effect the entire race of mankind.Aw 2-D games with great storylines make me happy like rainbows and candy. This game certainly has an interesting storyline, and some turn-style action going on. I'm actually, truth be told, a fan of turn-style action, so I might be a bit bias. Actually I like any game action so long as there's some substinance to it, but mostly turn-style because my reaction time to things is feeble. I also liked the ability to pick skills, use special abilities, and manufacture different items.My only real complaint is the command keys took a bit to get used to. Making items, taking three menus to get to a particular item, can be daunting. But, those are very minor complaints, and certainly not enough for me to say this game is crap. I was given this game as a gift, but I'm not sure about the $8.99 price. The game can be finished rather quickly. I might wait for a sale, although I also believe in supporting indie game developers as its hard to develop a game with a small staff! Really up to what you want to do. If you're like me you get all games on sale anyway because you haven't hit the lottery yet.Tl;dr Would recommend! Fun little 2-D turn-style game."

The story, unlike many other Maker games that I've played through the years is nicely done and thoroughly thought out. Mathew, the creator of this game, put quite the amount of effort into tailoring all of his labours together. This game isn't perfect, don't misunderstand- There are grammar issues. And once you understand combat and how status ailments work, you can form strategies knowing what you need to focus on as far as, combat goes. I spent seven hours playing this game until completion. I didn't get tired of playing it, I actually spent most of my day off playing it in just my one sitting.This game has three modes of difficulty: Casual, Hardy, and Dystopia. I've yet to attempt the last two. But now that I've got the combat down from Casual, I'm eager to hop back into the game all over again.There's no grinding for experience: You get points as you complete portions of the game, and spend them on abilities you desire. For combat and story purposes. Not every fight has to actually be fought. There are multiple ways to solve various problems you will encounter.All-in-all, this game, from my seven hours of play, was fun. I enjoyed it greatly. I'm looking forward to the next game from this developer. They've made some fun games over the years - Such as ""Atonement, Scourge of Time"", or any of the games from the ""Incitement"" series they have (first two are free, btw - they just are not here on Steam!)."

I am so below my usual acomplishment.I do admit as classical as this game is, mature quality of the visuals or not, this game surprised me from its developers other achievements.  I am used to collect all in similiar post-apocalyptic, dystopian and cyberpunk games.This game is best suited when all of your head can be concentrated in a story and its mechanic.  I suggest the easiest setting and to not waste amos, to wait before selling any armors and weapons, to save before entering any end map/screen.  Because this story seems linear, but it isn't totally and it gets your characters back in the face the consequences of their actions later in game.  It does not offer up that much loot and astronomical grinding for XPs.  You have to go tactical and strategical.  You have to read what is said and skip nothing.  You have to anticipate for the worst.  And certain parts even if no adult content is on, are truely mature and disturbing.  So much I was tempted to look if it was 14+ !There are a lot of moral issues in there.  Things I could expect with the developper's humor that too WAY another direction.  (At some part,I was chatting with him as I played and got my speculations and theories before seeing the results and probably made him chuckle while I was taken in the situation but away in another direction!)I might be partial here because one of the secondary character reminds me of a sibling, but in its niche, it's worth trying.  And, yes it is way darker than usual Astronomic Games, but it still have its signature humor and character types.  It gives a lot to think about our current society too.Is that game perfect?  No!  But apart the minor bit I outlined the creator of the game and that does absolutely NOT hinder the game itself, there is nothing so far as I finished an end of the game that really is worth frowning upon.  (Apart the power of storytelling, when it is required to remind the players how extreme corruption looks like...  And that goes with the style so nothing to tell against it.)I would recommend this one!"

It's shameless, really. Not like it isn't set up, and it isn't identical in every single sense; but it's close enough to be very obvious. That's...a major one."

The story was able to keep me into the game.  Best of all, there were a lot of choices to be made that affected future situations (such as sparing/killing someone, etc) which made the anticipation mount of whether or not sparing someone will bite you in the butt later in the game.Glad I tried it out."

I'm not a big fan of the overly-chibi style of much of the RPGMaker titles, nor their insistence on completely replicating aesthetics or world environments similar to those already seen in titles of the past on older consoles (namely a seeming overabundance of titles in fantasy settings, though those have their value as well, this caught my interest a lot more not being another ""knight, mage, priestess"" vs villain in armor and cape setting. As a fan of cyberpunk and espionage it's nice to see both implemented into the storyline and design at large so early in the game, which I imagine will continue as the story progresses. The story is well-written and some memorable characters / villains are present. The battle gameplay itself is familiar turn-based territory, while the music fits the sci fi / futuristic atmosphere.A user-selected progression of character Skills keeps things fresh, while gated sections of levels offer some replay as far as re-exploring areas after you have unlocked a characters Advanced Hacking / Lockpicking skills, etc...Based on the quality of this title, I will definitely give RPGMaker titles more praise."

If there is a good story to it, it is hidden behind a wall of frustrating and monotonous combat and I gave up before I could get to it.One of the reviews says ""gameplay is perfectly balanced (although a bit hard at the beginning)"", this apparently means facing enemies with seemingly 2000+ health when your party has a combined pool of 800 heath. This was on casual difficulty and thats just the leader, not including his lackies. After using all my items, ammo, abilities and reloaded multiple times I still couldn't beat him.I say ""seemingly"" cause you can't actually see enemy health, you have to guess which makes combat decisions rather clouded. I couldn't tell if my strategies made any diffirence or if I ever came close to winning, for all I know he has 10 000 health. When all your ammo and items are gone the fight is reduced to mashing spacebar and hoping, or you can try and predict his target and make them ""Defend"" which only drags out the fight or does nothing depending on your predictions.There is very little in the way of settings but I didn't really expect there to be. Besides changing the background color there is a resolution option that switches too fast to select the one you want but that doesn't matter cause the resolution never changes anyway. You can remap your keys but since whole thing is played with 2+movement keys that is mostly useless.At the end of all this I have only one question: How did this game get ""Very Positive"" reviews?"

It is a classic JRPG mechanically, but with a Cyberpunk setting drawing on works like Deus Ex.  Certain character skills will unlock different paths through the levels (for example, hacking mines or bashing a hole in the wall with super strength) and some enemies can be disposed of with grenades to avoid having to fight.  As skill points are awarded for completing objectives rather than combat, there is no grinding to be done.  The story branches at a couple points and there are a few different ways it can wrap up."
,Not Recommended,412170,29017355,Posted: 4 January,all,The Stranger,"An extremely short, but playable, Cyberpunk RPG with a smattering of quasi choice and consequence. It deals with the usual Cyberpunk tropes, so if that particular genre floats your boat you might somewhat enjoy City of Chains.There's nothing but sloppily implemented combat in this game, and though you can upgrade non-combat skills, you can't use them in creative ways to avoid combat or uncover alternate routes through the various areas. So, if you go into this thinking you can stealth your way through the game, prepare to be disappointed.There are some nice details in the game: news consoles in each area which give you an immersive look at the consequences of your quasi-choices, as well as some nice background info. There are multiple endings, but you can unlock all of them, I believe, in a single playthrough by simply saving at the right time (not sure if any of the dialogue changes in the endings based on your choices throughout the game) so replaying the entire game doesn't seem to be necessary. I also felt that most of these endings didn't even make sense from a narrative point of view.The story is predictable and dull. I found the entire cast of characters to be poorly written and uninteresting; they all have the personalities of a stone.  Despite the game page claiming there's choice and consequence, there's none to be found. What it really means is that there's a handful of different endings and a few minor dialogue swaps.The atmosphere of most areas is appropriately cyberpunky. However, there is little exploration in these tiny, barren, areas outside of one or two side-quests in each hub.All in all, this game isn't worth buying, the quality simply isn't there to justify it. Should you want to go slumming, make sure to pick it up at a greatly reduced price and enjoy a very bare bones RPG."

You don't gain XP from fighting battles but by completing tasks. As you complete tasks you get points that you can use to choose new abilities, including enablers for crafting, talking, picking locks, etc. All of this combines to encourage you to explore alternate skills to give you options for getting past obstacles. Many tasks can be defeated by throwing grenades outside of combat, hacking, talking, and the like.

There are some custom mechanics to the standard rpg mechanics combat. On the other hand everything is somewhat underpar and amateur. The sprites, the dialogue, the overall narrative, the soulless 3D sprite protagonists that are barely introduced and join the party. So I will not recommend it but will keep it around until I can review it in depth."
