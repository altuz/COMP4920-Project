76561198064414264,Recommended,412310,29767746,Posted: 7 February,all,Hopeless Situation Warrior,"Labyrinth just went free to play, although it's still in Early Access, so I figured I'd leave a review for people to see whether or not it's worth their time.Short answer: Yes..Long answer: ...Yess/REVIEW END -Throws smokebomb .. just kidding.Quick Review:It's a tactical battle thingy. It's good. It's free. It's like pokemon, except in 3D, you control awesome heroes, and you battle against mythological monsters. So not really like pokemon but you get the idea.Labyrinth?Yeah the name doesn't really show up in google that well, and there's no David Bowie, Jennifer Connelly, Goblin King or Bog of Eternal Stench (yet).Outline:You do collect cards from pack to use in battles, which work as your passives, minions(for bosses) and abilities. It plays like a tactical battle game. Currently (in Early Access) single battles take place in a single arena based on the boss. There's no limited ""energy"" system and you can play as much as you want. The cards are balanced (some cards are better, others are situationally better) and every hero and boss is unique in some way.Currently there are 6 heroes and 6 bosses, eventually there will be at least 2 heroes of every class type and 8+ bosses. The heroes of the same class share cards, besides a few guaranteed hero-specific cards, but you can only field one of each class. Every hero and boss gets at least one permanent passive ability, some armor, and some basic, more than decent cards to begin with.Bosses each have two classes and choose their minions and actions from those classes.It is a tile based game and some bosses/minions take up more tiles than others, from 1x1 (human sized) bosses all the way up to 3x3 (giant) bosses, and even 3x3 minions. The size of the bosses and minions has a subtle effect on play as well, and  in the current version the battlefield terrain can be altered, with lava or cracks, during battle. The battlefield terrain alteration mostly occurs around one of the bosses, who is a magma beast. He bleeds torrents of lava when hit, and can spew lava around him as an attack.Heroes get two basic abilitys, guard and an individual weapon, that don't consume a card and can be used for card draw or to save/use resources. The basic abilities can be upgraded with some cards, e.g. warfare heroes can equip better weapons, the mages can equip a spell book.The basic hero weapons themselves have their own class which can be affected by cards. E.g. the fire mage's fire spells become swifter at focus 10, which includes her base attack.The rogue engineer heroine's base attack counts as a ""ranged attack"" for perks and abilities that buff and trigger on those.Bosses don't have a base attack and have a smaller hand then heroes, allowing you some control over better AI performance and making boss combos more likely. Every day there is a quest that offers a sum of gold worth around 8-10 victories, so if you can only play once a day it is still efficient. You can hold 3 quests at a time, and change them each once.Old Reviews:There were more positive reviews from key backers, but due to a steam policy change of only allowing direct purchases to post reviews that count, some diminished.Hopefully now that it is free to play they can be restored.There was a critical bug that delayed the free to play update, and they fixed it the same day, meaning that free to play was only delayed by a single day.Is It Pay 2 Win Though?It doesn't feel like it.There's no premium only content. Everything is available to F2P, and the epic/legendary rate is quite high, although the coin rate is low (balanced by rate). You can also craft all of the obtainable cards in the game with a currency you earn from defense(your boss) battles and disenchanting duplicates. You can get an early lead on obtained cards by paying sure, but a lot of the fun comes from building up your deck and improving it.Casual matchmaking is partially based on how well you do, and of course Ranked mode is, so the tougher your deck, the tougher your opponents in general. It also means that if you're not doing well you'll likely be matched up with F2P decks in future anyway.It's also somewhat balanced in that, all cards are effective in one way or another, and for perks/minions, they have a card cost of which you can only spend so much. In my experience, well constructed F2P decks and smart play should be able to win against decks with higher rarity/more powerful cards. It also doesn't take that long to reach max level, by rough estimate you could collect most of the current cards in a few months by doing the daily quest everyday.You can quit at any time, or if you get disconnected from the game at any time, and you will be able to return back to the raid you were in the middle of.Playtime?By comparison, I have more hours on Labyrinth in a week than on:XCOM 2Hitman: Absolution (100% achievements)Dragon's Dogma: Dark ArisenOne Way HeroicsHand of FateCargo CommanderDungeon of the EndlessRisk of RainDid I mention it's free to play now?Please, stop reading, I don't have anything else, I beg you, I'm just a humble fisherperson.Game's discord:https://discord.gg/labyrinthControl overview (less obvious ones):Double-click on a unit to see more about it.Double-click on own units on timebar to see their hand, so you can plan better.Arrow keys or both mouse buttons to move around field.RMB to rotate and wheel to zoom in.In deck selection, RMB to study a summon from summon spell, or craft/disenchant card.Guarding is a good way to draw extra cards, since it only costs 1 tick. It's good for Faith if she draws all Heal cards and doesn't need to heal.Max handsize = appears to be 7, and when you reach 7, you just stop drawing cards until you use them?You can scroll the sidebar history in a battle to see moves longer than the previous 8 effects.When watching a replay, use Back in bottom left to exit.Spacebar can be used to skip turn (use Guard usually).Good luck and have fun!-throws realistic smokebomb"

It is refreshing in this genre and it is very challenging. I thought fighting against other people's bosses was going to be boring because normally AI is just AI not human, but wow, great work there. I know it is still in early access but i have revised all the cards and possibilities that this game can offer and i have to say the potential is huge.

Asymmetric MP (where you either raid dungeons with your hero squad or create your own dungeon raid experience for others to tackle) is also a HUGE plus in my book as it offers a new take on how you strategize and build your decks. It will be F2P on release, but if you get it now you'll be granted 10 booster packs once the shop is open (for $10 EA price, while you would have to spend $15 if you opted to buy the same amount once the game is released), so that is a nice little incentive to pick it up now."

The development team is very friendly and active in forums. Monthly updates.Pros:Polished graphics.Cards have interesting effects.Cards also feel equally powerful. There are a few strong effects, but for the most part each cardfills a niche.Unique heros and bosses.An all around well done blend of CCG and Board Tactics.Cons:Could use some varity in the sound effects. A lot of clangs and grunts.MORE HEROES! Currently there is a pyromage, tank, fighter, rogue, and priest. Before release, I'm hoping to see another Faith, Skullduggery, and Magic(?) hero.MORE CARDS! While the heroes and bosses are unique, a lot of the cards used in their decks are the same due to lack of diversity. I'm hoping by release the amount of cards in each catagory is doubled. Especially the perks and lairs.The game does get repetitive. Again, this is because of the lack of hero and card diversity and like all the ""cons"", will probably be worked out by the free to play release."

You'll spend hours messing with your own bosses trying to figure out effective builds.I'm really curious where the game ends up going in the long term since it's an AI based game with ranked mode. The metagame is undiscovered still for the most part since there are so few max level bosses around.I originally thought AI sounded boring for a CCG. Hearthstone dugeons were no fun for me, and I decided not to keep playing Elder Scrolls Legends cause they forced you into doing so many simple AI games. Labyrinth, however ends up feeling more like a WoW raid than a stress free HS/Elderscrolls encounter where you have unlimited attempts.Anyways, I would definetly recommend it. It really could use more players though because right now, I don't think many people are satisfied with how often their bosses are being raided ^^"

To complete this mission, you have but a certain amount of time. Time becomes crucial as you pierce trough the summoned hordes to defeat the stage boss. Soon you come to the conclusion that each move counts, as it costs you ticks (a portion of time) to complete an action. Each action is represented by a specific card and a deck of those cards defines a heroes moveset.It is much fun to tweak a deck to gain most out of your different abilities and look for synergies between cards and even heroes. Currently in an early stage of development there isn’t much to do except for raiding the three stages and defeating the bosses there.Overall a very promising game with lots of potential, possibly redefining the way we think about card games in the competitive sector. I personally will check out new features as they get added and am eagerly awaiting more."
76561198018764849,Recommended,412310,30431562,Posted: 10 March,all,Rain Drops,"""Getting your♥♥♥♥♥kicked has never been so much fun or rewarding.""Extended review on this game. My impression is overall, very positive. I'll explain why. This review will not cover the specifics of the game itself, aside from my experiences with various aspects of it that I feel was noteworthy.Prior Experiences and Expectations- Paying member of Solforge, Hearthstone, Cabals TCG (dropped hundreds of bucks over the years on these. No regrets).- Play alot of hobby board games across a wide range of genres.- Banner Saga: Factions. Enjoys tactics game that have a simple core design and are not RPGs. Hate RPGs actually. As little management as possible is best.- Injustice Mobile (you'll see why this actually becomes relevent).What drew me to Labyrinth- Diehard need to scratch the ""miniatures wargaming"" itch. And I mean, small scale, tactical battles that is NOT JRPG, anime-ish or Warhammer. What I really wanted was the D&D miniatures wargame. Something I admired, but never played.- Labyrinth, visually and mechnically, resonated with this desire and need.- Progress reports. You can tell right away that the developers are very market-oriented and open to the public at large. They keep us up to date, they respond to our questions- and they have an Early Access Game that is SOLID.The Mechanics-Still learning new things even though I've must have played over 10+ casual battles by now. The mechanics becomes clearer and clearer and I am astounded at how well designed it is. Initially I ignored the ticks entirely, feeling that it's extraneous, but now I am starting to pay attention once I figured out the relationship between ""how many cards I can play in a turn is dependent on whether I get moved behind another unit in tick, or I stay ahead of the enemy in ticks- which pretty much determines both initiative and resource usage."" Mindblown, I mean, technically, there is no such thing as a turn. The elegance is astounding. I love how the mechanics show you clearly what everything does- I don't find myself needing to look for additional information, through inference, I am understanding the depth of the game.-Once you've built a Boss Deck or Two, you start grasping the underlying principles of how the Bosses work and you could then build better Heroes.-The way they choose to present the information is very functional. The ring of health around each unit, and the TCG nature of utilizing keywords are useful. If you've played any kind of TCG/CCGs before, it's simple. And that's one of the things that set this apart. Alot of ""tactics"" games are badly disguised RPGs with alot of random chance and too MUCH STATS. Labyrinth has none of this problem. There is little to no RNG (and if there was, the cards tell you clearly), everything is clearly labeled, and you juggle with 3-4 stat types at most, with keywords.The Multiplayer- Raids are addictive. You just want to keep fighting. And when you're heroes died one turn away from total victory, you feel burning vengeance but also shame because it was entirely your own fault. So far, I always lose because I made a tactical error or I suddenly realize my Hero decks wasn't appropriately geared for fighting that specific Boss strategy. This game is not easy actually, and I wouldn't want it any other way. It teaches me better tactical awareness- and the fact I am aware exactly why I lost is very humbling and makes defeats have value, rather than feeling arbitrary. If you are after winning, you won't enjoy this game as much. But if you want tactics, this game oozes with it.-I had thought the whole ""passive defence multiplayer"" thing might be sketchy and wouldn't draw me in (even though I play Injustice Mobile. And Dungeon Keeper Mobile, which has exactly this kind of multiplayer), just like I had assumed that the tick system wouldn't click with me (pun intended), but they actually did it pretty well. The main joy is from devising a good Boss Deck to stomp Heroes when you're offline- since multiplayer is automated for the defender. The key I think, is synergy between the Boss's passive and the deck, but each boss has a Dual Nature, so you can access deck types of other bosses, in addition to unique ones.-So far, I have a ramp Boss (some freaky Mayan death goddess, can't spell her name) that gets stronger the more turns has passed. So her entire deck is freezing the enemy until you ramp to godhood.-The other bossI have set up (the giantess) is a ""everytime you play a non-attack card, you deal your attack to all enemies within 3 spaces"" (paraphrase), so her entire deck is amping her base attack and drawing enemies closer. And just for kicks, I made her generate ludicrous amounts of minions as well.-As a final note, asyncrhonous multiplayer makes it easy to drop in and drop out. No pressure. No waiting for people to take their turn. Quite casual and addictive. Like a crunchier Injustice Mobile (and we all know how addictive that is.)The Store-No premium currency. You get 10 gold per (casual) battle. Quests rewards 100 golds. 100 gold buys you a pack.-Again, like everything else, I thought I wouldn't be interested or care very much about the cards. Other CCGs have unique creatures and spells that are rich in lore and theme- those draw me in. But cards for attacks and spells for a couple of heroes and bosses? Bah? Boooring, right? BOY, Was I wrong. I actually care what cards I do get now. All cards can be crafted or disenchanted for crafting currency (forgot the name atm), so that's nice.-Booster packs (keys) are priced nicely, and are consistently priced. Unlike other games that encourage you to buy more for more discounts, this game straight up has a 1:1 exchange rate in terms of packs per buck. This is actually really nice, as I don't have to constantly juggle with ""delaying gratification"" problems. I get 100 gold, I buy a pack right away. This isn't strictly true if you're paying money directly for the packs, as it is slighly cheaper (by about 0.32 per pack).-I have dropped something like $25CAD on this game. Both for the original early access price before it went F2P and for 10 packs just the night prior. Because it was worth it and I wanted to support the game. At no point did I feel that I was pressured to get ""good cards"", indeed, for a vast majority of my heroes, I feel the low-cost or basic cards are the strongest. Hearthstone feels like a grind for example. This game? Not so much. Having only 4 hero classes (so far) and multiple heroes that share those classes with overlapping cards reduces the grinding or ""I lack essential cards"" feeling that other games produces. This is a huge plus and makes collecting cards an option-expanding activity rather than a chore.Conclusion:Overall, it has a minimalistic design philosophy that I really appreciate, both from the mechanics, and the economy. It fulfills a specific kind of niches for a specific type of gamer. It doesn't cheapen its brand by choosing to copy what everyone else is doing, but choosing to put thier own aesthetics and value on it. Of course, this may change as marketability changes, but for now I applaud their willingness to try something different. I look forward to what else this game has in store."

I think I made it through with about 12 using the option to heal between each fight. Point being keep healed up if you want to make it through. My opinion good design, decently challenging, and decent cards to play with hopes to build a large inventory of variety to play.

Yes, this game is complex and may be a bit overwhelming if you are completely unfamiliar with certain mechanics.Labyrinth delivers turn-based tactical combat in the form of a real-time player controlled squad of 3 heroes battling against another player's prearranged defensive setup controlled by AI.

The game is still in the alpha range and there's only a handful of cards/bosses/heros availble as of today so it's a recommend only if you like doing the early access thing of feedback/watching got improvrments etc. Solid core of a strategy rpg with some card mechanics and an intersting (though hopefully still to be fleshed out significantly) time managment system. I like the theme, basics, and polish thus far and the only thing I can say is that I want more content and deeper mechanics (potential is here and developers seem to want to build from the foundation first).I would give this a most improved award if it where an option for Steam Awards and if I voted for them.EA Grade - 6/10 and rising...."

Being able to both make your own dungeon for players to take on and tackle other player dungeons sounds quite enticing.  This review is based off full gameplay features and ~40 hoursBeing an early access game, understand there are incomplete features / UI and bugs that will be present.This is an updated review from my previous one months ago that had the conclusion of, you should wait if you want the full game experience and I believe this is still held true.There has been many fixes; balances; and content updates since the previous review but I think it's too focused on the polishing aspect as the overall content / player interaction still fills empty. After you reach level 15, you just get more cards then fight the AI, an experience that doesn't extend out too much from the norm. Maybe this is what the developers are aiming for, a simple experience, but maybe I just wish there was more interaction ; controll with your dungeon"

As is it gets a little repetative, and grinding is one of the key elements, as is the case with most of these online stratigy games. One thing they did do that I enjoy is they've removed the ""Fight other players almost exclusively to progress"" element most of these kind of games have, and made it so you now have to battle AI controled defences that other players set up instead. This way, you don;t have to worry about others rage quiting on you the turn before you win, and you can leave a game without hindering the experience for your opponent. It's probably the best game of it's kind I've ever played, but still needs a little work. Fortunately, it's moving right along."

It reminds me of the Heathstone for Blizzard but with tactical element. I enjoyed those 2 hours playing.Now let's get to business: First of all I spent £7 it's not a lot for PC game but recent content of game in not worth of even £1. I notice that I play to use microtransactions in this game. I hope you aren't planning to take ime game to pay-to-win path. Because these kind of game are usually so called free-to-play game and I spent already £7. I unsedstand that devs have to eat something and so on ... but plaese don't be greedy and ruin your vision promises with money. If you need extra cash think about something like to expansions to game (more quests, stories, maybe modes).I am hoping to see in this game things like huge world with lots of places to visit and explore and play CCG there. I am hoping to see lots of different types of monsters, occasional drop of loot (few coins or some cards) Those 10 coins for win is just boring you need more exitement - the more you play the stronger you are thing. Cards = equipment here, right? Random event would be nice too. PvP in this huge world (maybe joining some factions or clan wars). Ther may be introduced some bounties in villan players.I hope that some of my ideas can be useful to you guys.Can't wait for update. Good luck."

There are plenty of updates too.Now for the game.it's a pretty hard game at the start, because of the RNG or the fact every boss is different. Which makes it really fun. The game itself is actually a TBS were each hero got their own set of deck and you fight against a boss which also has it's own deck. your goal is either defend your labyrinth with your boss or raid someone else with your hero party of 3. Every raid succesful reward you with 10 gold. With that gold you can buy booster packs to gain more cards which is helpful for free to play players. You can also disenchant cards to eventualy craft the cards you want."

I can tell that once the majority of the content gets added and tested, it's going to be a stellar game. As it is right now, there's just not enough to do. You don't get any real rewards (coins, packs etc) for doing anything because it hasn't been implemented. I think it will be very soon, maybe even tomorrow. Either way, if you like strategy games and card games, you'll like this game."
,Recommended,412310,28186986,"Posted: 4 December, 2016",all,Chewy Speaker,"Labyrinth is off to a promising start. While in Early Access, there's quite a lot of options for deckbuilding available, and I have so far faced a decent variety of opponents (apparently diversity narrows near the top of the ladder, but that is to be expected for a CCG. Not there though, so can't comment too much about that.)As a PvE CCG, Labyrinth hits all the right notes: interesting deck design, a focus on synergies, and engaging gameplay. Perks, static abilities that you give heroes and bosses, are a fantastic addition, helping to make lots of strategies feel rewarding. Watching my characters come together by leveling just feels right for the pseudo RPG feel to the game.Unfortunately, the UI is pretty awful right now, and I am very much not a fan of using UIs designed for tablets on my PC. There is also a lack of some pretty important information (Wizardry Characters?) without digging. I would really like to see an in game manual, ideally one that goes into a lot of depth to game mechanics and timing (are Windup spells affected by buffs that end at the beginning of your turn?).If you do purchase, I highly highly highly recommend joining the game Discord (should be info on the community page), as the Developer is very active there and it seems to be the most active place to discuss strategy.So far, I would recommend Labyrinth to those that enjoyed Card Hunter, like turn based RPGs, and/or like to sink their teeth into creative deckbuilding. However, the game is still in relatively early development (late alpha), and at least two account wipes are planned, so if bugs, possible large scale game changes, or temporary progression are huge problems for you, I would wait and see on this one. Otherwise, it's quite fun and seems headed in a great direction!"

Unique concept!+: The game's graphics & what music is there all feels very AAA and not very indie.+: The game is optimized very well even this early, and runs perfect even on poor hardware.+: The developers are very responsive and active on the state of the game and what they are working on.~: More details on the business model in regards to card/hero/boss unlocks remain to be seen on how consumer friendly they are.-: The ""fluff"" of the game - the feel of how the attacks and spells feel is not perfect yet.

I was among the keenest to play this game, but after shelling over $10 for what is the most half-baked early 'alpha' in existence, I don't think I'll be returning.First of all, nothing is explained in the game.  I fumbled my way through the first two levels (I still don't understand what tick means) and there are so many random numbers sitting everywhere with no explanation that it feels like a total mess.  You can figure some out but others are abstract.  It's not a good experience for a new player.Second, the graphics are awful.Third, I wouldn't even call this a demo.  Demos at the very least have one full, playable level.  This is like pre-pre-pre-pre-alpha and should never have been released to the public.Fourth, the main problem is is that there's so little to actually give feedback on.  Graphics, awful, turn-based gameplay with cards, OK it's... whatever.  Difficulty is quite high to begin with (and mostly because you don't really know what you're doing) but that's fine... the rest doesn't even exist.  It's like trying to give feedback on a piece of white paper.You have a long, LONG way to go before this is in any kind of respectable state and you have a lot of gall asking people to pay for this...  and as such, there's no way I'd recommend the game as-is."

The slog to get that 400 gold was miserable enough so I can't imagine how it would be to get 1500 so I can't, at present, recommend this game until some balancing is done with how hard bosses ramp up in a fairly small amount of time as a free player."
