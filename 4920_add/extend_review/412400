,Not Recommended,412400,29636287,Posted: 1 February,all,overld,"Pointless game, and do not even bother paying for any DLC for this product.  The point of the game is to make it to one of the 5 unknown signals so that you can be rescued.  The game only allows you to get to one of the unknown signals, and that is a space walkman.  The other four signals cannot be reached since there are invisible walls preventing you on getting to them.  Also when you run out of air, the game says you are dead, but the game keeps on playing.Complete waste of time and don't even bother trying it as a goof.  This game is just a hold ""W"" simulator.  To even check those other items, I stuck things in my keyboard to have the W key held.  So boring!"

The whole game is walking across the moon super slow whilst meteors happen to fly right at you every time. It's really not that fun. It's free so you can always try it, but I don't suggest it."

76561198281484746,Recommended,412400,29812655,Posted: 9 February,all,FreakeyP,"I really wanted to love this game, but was sadly disappointed.Absolutely stunning visuals and sound, but in the end, it just ended up being a walking simulator on the moon.After walking lengthy periods of time to get to beacons, I seemed to be greeted by invisible walls, and was never able to reach them.As the game came out in 2015, you would think this would have been resolved, but apparently it has not.Lack of instructions on what to do also hampers the gameplay.Since it is a free game, I would recommend that you try it out to see if you can achieve the goal of reaching the beacons, but don't be surprise if you can't.Don't take my word for it, and check out my video by clicking on the link.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvmpUzqR29A"

Well ponder no longer, it turns out neil armstrong and his pal Buzz Aldrin were running around dodging meteors the size of houses while sprint ungodly distances to find sony walkmen casette players that they couldnt even pick up. GASP does a excellent job of recreated this exact historic moment in stunning clarity, after a full .25 hours i can say this game is an absolute must have for anyone who enjoys being forcible sodomized by giant rocks."
76561198111646866,Recommended,412400,29835571,Posted: 10 February,all,AugustusFuckingCaesar,"I would like to begin by saying no other game has affected me in the way GASP has. The urge to kill myself was immense, from beginning to end. Games that create this much emotion clearly have the best writing. A game that can make you cry out of joy, fear, sadness, and utter boredom: that's what I want! To add, the physics on the meteors was astoundingly realistic. It is a little-known fact that meteors bounce like beach balls. The skybox was very realistic, too. Two massive space stations looming on the horizon? Amazing!The best part was the cliffhanger ending. I was on the edge of my seat. After I was done playing this game, I just HAD to review it. This is a must-get game for any space and beach ball enthusiasts!"

,Recommended,412400,29642017,Posted: 1 February,all,Charlie,"I was bored and wanted to find the worst possible free to play game.I failed at that, but in doing so I discovered something truly beautiful.The wonders of slowly pacing forward for 30 minutes while giant rocks bombard you. An unintelligible voice talking to you in your ear. A confusing ending in which I was apparently in a simulation the entire time (sorry, spoilers).Overall, 11/10, game of the year 2kforever."
,Recommended,412400,29598066,Posted: 30 January,all,Meowseph Stalin,"I highly suggest this game for anyone looking for a Thrilling, action packed, incredibly good looking experience.Pros-FREEHandsome 3D texturesExciting and Realistic AtmosphereKeeps you on the edge of your seatRealistic Hazards (ie Sand(?)storms, Meteor Showers, Fog)Stunning SkyboxNot P2WBeautiful AmbienceGreat ControlsConsDLC costs moneyWhat follows is a true account of ACTUAL gameplay, viewer discretion is advisedSo I start the game up, set the quality to high of course and I look at a black screen for what seems like days. When suddenly, I see a blurry background of earth, and a disgusting noise with so much distortion it was impossible to decipher what it could possibly be, looking back now, I realize that was him gasping for air (Clever title eh?). At this point my teeth are clenched because It hurt my ears badly, but I decide to continue, when out of nowhere the menu slams straight into my eye sockets causing me to flip off my chair, Dark ambience screaming into my ears, I begged for it to stop for several moments when it finally does, had god heard my pleading and gave me mercy? No, the music just stopped for some reason and when I clicked on ""Can you survive?"" The music came back, it then took another lifetime to show a screen asking me to choose my planet, I could choose the planet moon or the planet mars. Of course, because the planet moon is my favorite planet I chose that one. Now, I'm loaded in and I'm walking around. Apparently I crashed but the 12 year old girl talking doesnt seem to care much. She mentioned low oxygen but says that I got to walk to one of the 5 ""Unknown signals"". So I walk to one of the signals, this one 2000m away, that already sounds bad and it gets worse because your astronaut walks like a crippled old man and it looks like he's limping because the camera falls almost touching the floor and bobbing the screen every footstep. I was already starting to get bored of this walking when I noticed that meteors were falling everywhere. I hadnt noticed them before because of the sandstorms and fog and the constant bleeding effect on my screen. I thought it was cool (for a second) until I noticed that they kept flying down from the sky and pin pointing my exact location and hitting me. Some would just collide into the moon at Mach 4 but just float slightly off the ground or bounce away. One of them hit me but thats not a problem because on the planet moon rocks dont stop you! You stop the rocks! After this I just went along until I reached the first signal. It was a Box with a wire going across it and a dial that goes onto a stove. The next signal was 4500m away but it took 15 mins to go 2000. After this I uninstalled the game and wrote this review, hopefully you found it helpful.If that whole story wasnt exciting then you're in for one ride if you decide to install it (Dont).  I seriously dont Recommend this game it is bad in every way, except controls, but how could you mess up W A S D and the spacebar?"

There is an invisible barrier in a square around the crash site that allows you to only reach the closest beacon, which is just a piece of wreckage that you can't interact with."
,Not Recommended,412400,29794821,Posted: 8 February,all,Charles Baxter,"Music ruins the mood and the voice acting is horrible. Also im pretty sure that nasa or whatever space agency would figure out for you that the one of the 5 ""unknown signals"" were human instead of looking through your visor and having you guess with your life depending on it. Achievements dont even work."

,Not Recommended,412400,29830571,Posted: 10 February,all,Jortsen McGrumbles,"The developers clearly didn't care about this game. There is insane screen bobbing and blurry filters that look like they are straight from instagram. The gameplay consists of walking at the speed of a snail towards an item that you can't interact with while you are bombarded by astroids that don't even do damage. The fact that you can get hit by ten asteroids and still survive is odd when the game tells you that it is a difficult game with ""no handholding"" and that when you die you DIE even though it is nearly impossible to die. The asteroids hit the planet and just bounce right off like a bouncy ball. So bad."
