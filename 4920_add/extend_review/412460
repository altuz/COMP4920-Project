It has a really low replay value.The story to the game pretty much follows tutorial missions. The story was somewhat interesting yet definitely one of those stories you probably do not want to hear again.There is a lot of comparison between Villagers and Banished. The similarities are both there and not there. Seeming how they are both medeival builders there is always going to be similarities. Meanwhile most those spouting the similarities avoid the simple answer. Which would you rather play Banished or Villagers? Since I own both I would pick Banished even without mods.So why the thumbs dumb?1. Maps. The game does NOT have a random map generator. I mean seriously, that is the majority of the replay value of any sandbox builder game. There is no map editor either.2. Production balance. After playing a while the production values of various buildings seem very wonky and unbalanced.- Barn had animals that pretty much died of old age before producing enough offspring to keep the barn producing.- Other production issues resolved.3. Combat. They tried putting some form of combat into the game.  Wild animal attacks and raiders. Honestly never should have bothered. Neither raiders or wild animals actually killed any villagers so kinda not seeing the point in investing in guards. It looks like the raiders basically ran in stole some stuff and ran off with it.4. No refilling jobs. Anyone who played Banished knows this one. If a villager dies their job should be automatically filled from the pool of available laborers. Not having that feature in this game made it annoying once your settlers start dying off and you miss filling their job.5. Bugs. Quite a few have been fixed however still a couple big ones that can ruin a game through population aging and starvation.The game is getting better, there has been work on it since release. It just aint quite there yet I would recommend people to buy it. However if I knew someone that bought it, I would not make fun of them for owning a crappy game. So almost a thumbs up."

Not sure I'm all about that. Hate that I had to spend 20 bucks to figure it out as well. This would be better if you could recruit a workforce from outside towns, and had a more realistic resource scale, coupled with bigger maps.

They never update the game anymore and they havent tried to fix the bug they even ignore people that say they have it in the steam forums so I feel this game is not worth what it costs since you can only play campaign mode and they are not even trying to fix the problems with it. I dont even see why they would still sell this game because you really cant play most of it because of the bug they havent fixed. I feel they are trying to steal money from people since they are still selling this game so dont buy this game if you dont want to waste your money its one of the worst games on steam.

It's easy to pick up and play with very little challenge. I can't give it a positive rating because although I didn't encounter any bugs the game itself just isn't that great. There are not really that many buildings so there isn't a complex production chain to learn and there aren't any decorative buildings and there aren't even any roads. It doesn't seem to matter to your villagers if they live on a diet of a variety of fruits vegetables bread meat milk eggs....or if they just eat fish. Might as well just have 2 fishing piers. There is an herbalist in the game who gathers wild herbs and creates medicine. But in the entire campaign playthrough I never once saw a villager get sick and need medicine. You can build a chruch and the priest will bless houses and the villagers will go to mass, but if you turn the church off for an entire year they don't seem to mind all that much. Maybe the happiness goes down a little so they work slower but it's really not noticable. Overall the price is too high for what little you get of the game. It's lacking the complexities and decision making that makes city builders fun."

Even more annoyingly, at one point my entire village simultaneously died ""of natural causes"", the seasons sped up to a blur of constantly changing, but despite the fact that everyone was dead according to the population screen, there were still people wandering around the village. Zombies, presumably. Also, I couldn't figure out why my farmers would only grow vegetables despite having a grain field as well, they never touched it. I even built a second farm house, but they all just wanted vegetables."

It was challenging and interesting, even with some of the bugs in the game.It has similarities to Banished, yes, though Banished doesn't have a campaign mode which is why I picked this up!Unfortunately, until the makers of the game actually work on fixing the bugs that appeared after the last patch, the Sandbox mode is completely unplayable. After one turn through seasons, everything starts speeding up, seasons cycle so fast and all your villagers grow old and die.I cannot recommend this game until it has been fixed, and considering it has been months since this issue has been brought to the developers, I don't think we'll be seeing that happen anytime soon."

ALOT.The design of this game is well done and things are easy enough to get a handle on fairly quickly.The only issues that I have been currently having to deal with are-Farmers just forgetting how to do their jobs ( just not farming in any season )-Villagers falling through the map and then dying due to starvation-Foresters not planting trees or chopping them down.All in all though, this is a very fun game and way better than bannished.Also I have noticed that at X8 speed ( which I have set to most of the time ) villagers tend to freak outand just run in place looking all glitchy for about a min or 2. Then go back to what they were doing.I give this game 2 thumbs and a big toe up.Solid game and alot of fun to play.P.S. The updates you guys are doing are awesome.New Review update.So recently got my village up to 86 villagers, had about 380 food, beer, and the church.Then out of nowhere all of my farmers ( save 2 ) just started hanging out by the water catcher and just stood there while the entire village starved to death. This is the third time i have been at 80+ Villagers and the farmers just stopped working. I was even making them tools as well.Please adress this issue, for I have no clue as to what is causing this."
,Not Recommended,412460,22282447,"Posted: 7 April, 2016",all,C.L.U.,"First off, this is not a bad game, if like many had pointed out, Banished did not exist, this might be a different review. It does however, so a positive differential between these two games would swing my vote.The initial difference you will find is the visual novel superimposed upon the game. The story is written with some competency and as is the way with v.n.'s, it's quite in your face about some of the sordid details of life. Now when I first booted this game up it asked whether I was female or male, the default being female, this told me that the developers were targeting the fairer sex and that coupled with the visual novel aspect, really puts me out in the cold.The game itself, is fine, the standard resource collection and settlement building is in place. Nothing separating it from Banished, save for the fact the simulation is less complex. There are nice touches, the way you build a jetty was quite nice and well thought out.The graphics, they're better than Banished but only just, there is the most desperate need for SSAO, if they added that it would look so much better. The models, functional, again no better than the aforementioned game, no specular, no bump, modest scale textures.I won't touch on the maps, or lack thereof, the future will tell.All in all, if the story was reflected in the code, this would be the most amazing game but at the moment, the separation between the two is so large, it highlights the loss of direction this team has experienced."

I did recommend untill as I played this game alot of stuff doesn't work- it doesn't produce tools the  other buildings hardly produce more than one item it just doesn't work correctly- the workers leave their jobs constantly-the barn works great not much else!its only worth 5$ not 19.99- Bannish is way better than this at least it works and has roads so that you can build a cobblestone Village!

I say 'decent' and not 'awesome' because Villagers appears to be somewhat unpolished, with an overly-simplistic UI. That could change with regular dev updates (see below).There are a few hours' worth of campaign missions (read tutorial missions with a lengthy storyline), and then for those who just want to play without any interruptions, there are the freeplay maps of various sizes that do play a lot like Banished in that I-just-want-to-build-stuff-in-a-slow-and-therapeutic-fashion sort of way.Have a look at the Community Hub though...you'll notice that the devs are constantly working on admirable improvements, and already the game has become much more user-friendly since launch.

76561198036310945,Recommended,412460,22135540,"Posted: 29 March, 2016",all,ADK1994,"Pros:->Really impressive storyline - it makes the campaign very enjoyable, but be warned it takes quite a bit of reading-> Promising population mechanics, I really enjoy how the villagers can have families and it is fun to watch them interact with the village-> Challenging gameplay with production chains that are affected by weather: if winter hits before your grain is done growing...ouch. Food is tough to gather, and so is stone and iron. Water is also a resource you need to watch. The villager reproduction rate also makes it challenging because losing one villager is enough to topple the whole system. Some people think that makes it too hard, I love it.Cons:-> The game is buggy. Villagers do not move into houses that lose a family, so you end up with a bunch of homeless people while there's perfectly good houses sitting around.-> Farmers do not interact with the fields very well. As far as I can tell, the 'harvest fields prematurely' button doesn't even work.-> I had a few cases where merchants stopped showing up, I would have to build a new port or warehouse to bring them back.-> Limited help. There's not really a 'help' program in the game and there isn't a wiki yet. The campaign will teach you a lot, but I still don't know if it is possible to demolish a building or not.Despite the bugs, I would still recommend this game! I've logged almost 7.5 hours so far and I'm still on the campaign. It's a good, challenging game that will take you time to get through. All of my cons are bugs, and I'm banking on most of the bugs being fixed by future updates.Finally, if you're looking at this just because it is 'like Banished', buy it with a grain of salt. Both games have you building settlements from the ground up, but Villagers focuses more on the story/campaign and less on the sandbox mode."

With Villagers, it seems like bumblebee was trying to create Banished with a campaign storyline, which is the main thing that Banished lacks, so that was a good goal. Unfortunately the missions are really buggy, and the pacing is off -- some are too easy and quick, and others are almost too hard to get through, partly because of bugs like merchants getting stuck in warehouses and never leaving. And all the clicking through the dialogue boxes can get seriously maddening.Free play mode is more fun. The game mechanics are a lot like Banished: you have to be careful not to grow too fast or everyone will starve to death, but grow steadily or your population will crash as your villagers age. There are guestworkers you can hire, but they can't move in and start families, like the nomads can in Banished. The trading system is much too simple. It seems like I can only trade wood, stone, and iron, and occasionally pick up some beer. Meanwhile I've got two barns producing a surplus of farm animals, meat, milk, and eggs, and I can't unload any of it to buy the wood that I've run out of because the foresters seem to plant trees at a geologic pace.Once bumblebee works the bugs out, Villagers should be fun to play, and especially if they can fix the campaign mode, it will hit a good middle ground between Banished and Settlers. Worth playing, but maybe wait for a few bug releases to be completed first."

However, when placing new structures on the map, the buildings are too small. Could we zoom in a little to see the orientation of the placement. Also could you adjust the brightness of the screen? The night time cycle to me is a bit too long. How about a map generator? It would be nice to zoom more down to a street level like in the Tropico series. So with all that said.

Therefore, I decided to write my own first review because I almost didn't buy it because of the mixed reviews.  I am totally enjoying the game.  In my oppinion it is not like bannished.  Perhaps if you play it in sandbox mode.  I am playing the campaign.  The storyline is wonderful to me and easy to follow.  Granted, it does get a little wordy at times and you have to read several screens.  However, that's what makes it a story.I did find one minor bug.  My quest would not register that I completed them.  I believe this was due to the fact that I was pausing the game ALOT during the storyline and all.  Once I stoped doing that I didn't have a problem.  So, you might want to watch how much you pause the game.I think if your looking for a fun and reasonably challenging game this is for you.

It had a certain difficulty curve that took a few tries but once you get it, its very fun.I have a few reasons that I am not recommending this at this price.  Most of them stem from the fact that this still feels like an EARLY RELEASE STILL.1) I found a few annoying bugs.  Bad pathing of villagers, merchants especially bug out alot.2) unbalanced.  There is really no need for some of the jobs like blacksmith, pharmacists, priest. Happiness is easy to attain just by getting them food... Goodluck.. they breed and eat like rabbits.3) Lags when you reach 55-65 villagers.  There is so much going on at that point if you managed to provide enough food that you get this weird lag.  I have a good computer that can run top games, so this shouldnt be an issue.  I feel like it's part of the code."

It has great potential to be one of my favorite games. However, it's too similar to Banished for me to enjoy enough to keep playing, and it still has some bugs that could mess up my village (farmers forever farming veggies, even when deleted. To fix: Reassign the farmers, but the field will be visually stuck there barren.).Pros:-Funny adult humor (ex. the stork arrives shortly after hearts fall from the sky on a house and moaning can be heard XD)-Creative attention to detail (ex. the stork, different clothing) - I would like to see more because these separate it from Banished-Nice new style - different types of animals run around freely, each character has a spouse (even if this isn't obvious by their interactions other than making babies), the professions have different clothing (farmers look like farmers), etc.-I enjoyed watching my villagers. Even though they had a job, they slept at night, talked at the town hall and raincatchers/wells, and helped each other up if someone fell down.-It feels like the environment of the map I chose, and it feels quite alive (the way the merchant comes is kinda awkward for me though)Cons-The map I played on was really small; I could see the issue of space down the line-Too many aspects of Banished. It feels like if Banished was simplified, given a new look, and had a couple cool added aspects.-Not many buildings - I know, it's small, and it does add upon and tweak Banished buildings, but it feels like there could be more since it has a villager-focus. The baths are a nice touch. Maybe a courthouse and random divorces? A school housefor the kids?-Some aspects don't seem to work as they should - Why does the merchant only want and sell building materials if he clearly has a food stand? The journal opens up in freeplay mode behind a lot of the other menus, such as when clicking on the town hall."

The developers seem passionate about fixing whats wrong with this game, and I do find it quite fun. I would say in about a month, it will be a great addition to your steam library."

If you buy it, i am afraid you will be very disapointed.If it came out in the early 1990s it would have been a great game, but today it is totally waste of time to play.This game should be used as an idea of to make a similar ww2 game, (but with 5000% better graphics) that could work, but not like it is today.If you still dont believe this negative review, please check on youtube or somewhere for a ""playable"" demo first, that would kill your wish to buy this ""masterpiece."""

There's no instant gratification, there's no entertainment. You follow the tasks but they're not even fun. And OMG what's going on with all the text! it's like the Wikipedia times 10. Everything comes witha long text even if you're just cutting a tree I mean come on! There are 6 villagers to start with, and  they will all talk and talk and talk. And you cant even close those texts right away, they even have a slow slide animation. At one point your screen will be full of messages and texts of all kind, none relevant, none enjoyable, none entertaining.  This game feels like filling paperwork.And for the record I  do appreciate a good story. But this is not the case. The text is just noisy. There's no script, some villager drama at min 0? why would you care about this long complaint made by a hunter about patroling woods when you dont even have a house and are trying to figure how to make the dumb villagers move and chop some trees. It's so dumb"
