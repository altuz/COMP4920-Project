But compared to other TD games on PC it falls way behind. Games like Defender's Quest, Defense Grid (1+2) and GemCraft offer both deep and satisfying gameplay - for around the same price.Evil Defenders feels like it belongs on a tablet or a phone. At first you might not notice, but it becomes clear after a short while. It's very simple and doesn't offer much in terms of strategic planning. My advice to you is pretty simple as well:If you are new to TD games this might be a good place to start (although I'd wait for it to be on sale). Be sure to check out the games above afterwards.If you are a TD veteran you will be wanting more out of a TD game that costs €9.99. Gameplay is just too simple."

The game has 15 levels and each level can be played in five different difficulties and one challenge mode. In order to gain all stars you have to play every level in all difficulties. Some players complained about this but I think the different difficulties nicely enhance the gaming experience.Pros:- nice graphics- very well balanced in terms of difficulty- good music- addictive- it's funCons:- two achievements can only be collected if you add another +/- 100 hours play time after finishing the game

It may be a mobile port but it runs full screen at 2560x1440 and makes use of all that real estate.

At first I wasn't sure it had much depth, and then I found it really difficult, but after overcoming these doubts, I really loved it. In Evil Defenders, you play the part of a defending horde of skeletons, goblins, ghosts and demons. The artwork is great, but there is something unsettling about the look of the human mob. They seem to have their bottom lip somewhere around eyeline, covering their noses. Let's just say, the graphics and sound are the best I've seen in a tower defence game and that any misgivings were soon forgotten.Attrition is what tower defence games are all about, so a certain amount of grind is to be expected, but expect a lot of it in Evil Defenders. Eventually, you will gain enough power-ups that seemingly impossible levels suddenly become easy, even with time speeded up. If you make the right choice of power-ups early on and don't try to change them mid-way through, you could finish the game more quickly. I found the special abilities like extra health were better in the long run than the more obvious choices like tower upgrades."

,Not Recommended,412520,19081232,"Posted: 14 November, 2015",all,Yiasmat,"(04/10) - Decent but too many flawsThe more i play this game, the less i like it which is really sad as it stands out through its clever level design, being very well polished and a decent number of different enemies and towers.These are the things it does well which make the game stand out from the others. The problem however comes with the things it doesn´t do well.If you set aside that you are basically playing the same missions over and over again, which didn´t really bother me that much, the fact that the first time you play a mission (standart difficulty) is by far the hardest and most recognizable one doesn´t go well with it.The ONLY challenging waves are the early waves which doesn´t change with increased difficulty. There are some exceptions on this, more to that later, but this makes the later waves (and thus the higher difficulties) feel even more like a grind as you´re just sitting there on speed x4 waiting for it to be finally over. Once you figure out which towers are good and which aren´t (which is the sad truth this game faces) you will find yourself rarely slowing down the speed to actually use your abilities.When the game completely fails however, is when you make it to the final wave and get completly destroyed by it´s wave. It is not always the same which strong enemies you get which sadly reeeeally matters here. Getting a juggernaut, a summoner or a paladin makes up everything in the earlier difficulties as you can´t build defenses against all 3 types in such a short time making them once again way more difficult than higher difficulties.There are some exceptions to this however and overall what i took from this game was not the grinding of later difficulties but the overall design it has. That´s what makes this game special and that is the only reason why you should buy it. If you don´t own a lot of the TDs here on steam i´d still suggest getting another, as there are better ones out there, some even with nearly the exact same tower scheme."

It does appear to have its origins in the tablet world, but the conversion to PC is excellent.I've played dozens of TD games and this is one of the best. The graphics, sound, controls - all the technical features are well done. I was a bit disappointed to learn that there are only 15 maps, but they are all so different and interesting that you will get plenty of play value for your money.I like the fact that each map has a special feature, such as a swamp that you can pay to have create a haze of poisonous fog. Most TD games have more levels than this one but many of the levels are very similar, not so with Evil Defenders."
76561198052385083,Not Recommended,412520,23445989,"Posted: 7 June, 2016",all,Loanwulf,"This game is clearly a mobile port and it shows in the game design.  I bet that in that version you could ""pay"" to get quick upgrades.  Not in this version; it demands that you grind and grind you must.  You quickly realize that all of the towers are prettty much worthless without some significant upgrades.  Upgrades that cost staggering amounts the in-game currency (that's what the grinding is for).  So if you like replaying the same levels over and over for incremental upgrades then go ahead and try this game.In almost and any decent tower defense game, the player should be able to cruise through the the lowest difficulty without too much issue.  This usually prepares you to tackle the tougher difficulties.  By the fourth or fifth map, I was already seeing difficulty spikes (on the lowest difficulty) that made any strategy I used worthless (that's with some grinding too).  I believe this was also a relic of the mobile version as this game appears to have been designed such that you would hit a ""wall"" and pay to advance.  Except that in this version you don't have that option.  You either pay by grinding or you don't advance, simple as that.  No strategy necessary.All in all, this games screams free to play with microtransactions (typically the kind that gates progression), only it's not and you've already paid.  If you are looking for a good tower defense game, try out Kingdom Rush or Defense Grid 1 & 2.  I realize that Kingdom Rush is also a mobile port but it's game design is so much better than this and way more balanced."

Got the typical ""get 3 star rating"", which means you can clear levels multiple times on higher difficulties. It does what it wants to do more or less well. A budget game if you ask me, but not a bad one. It's got some spells, a few different towers, standard enemies and an upgrade system.Edit: The game's ""progression system"" gets increasingly dull after only a short while. The upgrades are just stat increases and you can't afford them easily later on, which mean...grrrrrrrinding. Yeah, how I hate grinding in such games...you can clearly see the mobile roots. Grind successful missions and difficulties to increase the potential of your towers. Certain missions require certain towers. In other missions your fully upgraded tower might be useless. Some towers are plain useless anyway. Long story short, you can pretty easily beat the game by just playing mission after mission, mostly. But the harder difficulties and challenge missions require a lot of grinding, which is why this game is already getting uninstalled again. Kingdom Rush did it better, did everything better to be honest."

,Recommended,412520,19086274,"Posted: 14 November, 2015",all,Hobbes,"The defenders are evil, the game is good, and the crowd goes wild!Once upon a time there was a game called Kingdom Rush, it was popular, it was popular because as Tower Defences go it was polished, easy to get into and well balanced, whilst at the same time maintaining a solid, and interesting set of upgrades as well as a good set of unique twists that made the game genuinely great in it's own right. There's been other genuinely excellent Tower Defences as well (Defence Grid : The Awakening being the prime example), however, these are few and far between. Most of the time, you get ""decent"" attempts, or ones that are just forgettable...... until now.Take a bow Evil Defenders. Please, come forward onto the stage, and be showered with roses and cheers, for you are most definitely one of the greats, and deserve to be welcomed and feted. Now that's not going to be unreserved praise. There's a few things I will take up with you, but considering you get so much right, I think we can get alongjust famously.Evil Defenders doesn't do anything particularly new or novel, it doesn't break ground in any significant one (save for a minor twist, which is actually rather neat in it's own right), but what it does is take what exists, and it applies polish. It applies polish over and over, until there's this worn in lacquer that's almost, almost Blizzard worthy. At a price point that makes this a real bargain.First impressions can be misleading...Now to be fair, the first impressions are going to have you sit back in the seat and make you wonder if the game really is all that. The intro video screams ""Mobile game, Clash of Clans, Free To Play"", it's got -those- kinds of vibes about it. The options menu is utterly bereft of anything bar a couple of sound sliders and a toggle for health bars over the tops of things (Really? That needs to be an option? If it was a choice between bars and numbers, that'd make sense at least...), still, you fire up the first map and then things begin to look up, there's a set of difficulties (some locked off) and a challenge mode.Normal mode to begin with is merely the appetiser, it's generally pretty easy as long as you don't fall asleep at the wheel or make entirely dumb choices, as the tower positions are fixed all you need do is make the ""correct"" choices as to what goes where. However, there's another -four- difficulties after that, going all the way to inferno at the top which throws a marathon number of waves, comprised of advanced mobs from later maps and forcing you to adapt and improvise, taking lessons from much, much further in, and applying them to your earlier levels. Things begin to look up...... and then you open up the upgrade tree.The Nine Levels of Upgrade Heaven (and Hell)Ohhhh lordie lordie. The upgrade tree is -massive-, not only does it branch like a massive set of snaking vines, along multiple paths, with individual paths for each tower and power type, as well as a utility tree for things like ""Bonus bounties"" from killed mobs. But you can level the upgrades iteratively, so buying the same upgrade multiple times improves the bonus it gives. This means setting up specialised builds is a thing (at least before the eventual maxing out of -everything- if you're OCD about minmaxing your towers).The game goes from being this rather generic looking tower defence to being this amazingly polished and genuinely deep tower defence that offers real replayability and a serious flexibility in how you design your defences and how you guide your playstyle. The level of customisation as a result is absolutely incredible, not counting the sheer level of upgradability in game (each tower has three tiers of base upgrade, followed by their specialist three tiers depending on the path you pick). On top of this, each level has a landscape feature that may help or hinder you to some extent, learning how to use this to your advantage can be critical in helping stem the tide (the prime example is the oil river on the desert map that can be lit up to cause DOT fire damage).It's not all fun and games in Evil Land...There ARE complaints though. First, no endless mode. For me this is a minor issue, but one that should be noted nonetheless. Some people might care about it more than others. Secondly, the game can feel grindy at times, you will need an awful lot of souls to max out your upgrade trees, but again, that's only an issue you intend to minmax the whole lot. Finally, the game, whilst amazingly polished, doesn't do -much- to move things forward, but then this is one of those ""reviewers"" things, for most people this isn't even going to be a consideration. If you're looking to try something really -new-, this is something to bear in mind.These are however, in case you've not already noticed, nits. Minor complaints, these are small hitches in an otherwise stellar presentation of Tower Defence, and easily one of the strongest TD's since the likes of Defence Grid and Kingdom Rush. At the price point it's pitched at, it's a very, very easy sell.Verdict :Highly Recommended - Particularly to people looking to get into Tower Defence games AND to TD fans alike.Writer and columnist forJust Reviews, where you can get similar fine reading material.

Though slowdown of other PC of engine does not seem to be the culprit.Mechanics are lack luster and tower AI is atrocious as the seem to select targets willy nilly or at random, typically changing targets at the worst opportunity. An example would be instead of finishing off an enemy about to heal itself or activate a dash, they will instead select another target that has is typically last in line or has the highest health, which in turn usually means the Priest is allowed to heal themselves and all their companions back to full health. It's seemingly random as to wether your minions select the proper target and even more so as to whether or not they will actually STAY ON it.Powers seem randomly spectacular and underwhelming as well. Being the evil leader (Or something) you may strike with lightning, teleport, and summon a demonic creature. Lightning can chain down a clustered line of targets, but sometimes will only strike a single target and deal minimal damage only to adjacent creatures. Teleport typically targets the attacker behind the leader for some odd reason as though it doesn't properly line up with the cursor. However as with lightning strike it can work correctly seemingly at random.The only well functioning aspect appears to be the artwork which is chuckle worthy, but the specialness wears off when fighting with the game mechanics for the better part of ten minutes per map, having to restart merely because a tower decided that it was going to switch targets at the worst moment.Final thoughts: There are far better tower defense games out there. ""Don't Steal my Gems"" on Ninja Kiwi will serve far better, and it is free."

Still haven't beat it yet but there's just so much neccessary grinding (which isn't a bad thing in this case) that I feel it will still be awhile before completion.One thing that could possibly disuade some people is the lack of maps. They are very well laid out and each one has it's unique gameplay element, but you will be playing the same maps on different difficulty levels several times till you finally unlock the Challenge Mode, which you will then grind for upgrades.

That being said, the game introduces map specific activatables and wave events that can spice things up, a nice add. You get your typical array of towers with a nice new addition (the summon tower) but what really breaks the game for me is the tower progress tree: want to make your tower better? Spend skulls, want more skulls? Clear more maps. Rinse and repeat. If you remove this you'll find the game to be very shallow.Story: You get the bare minimum to context why humans are trying to pillage Evil's land (pure statement, it's just a quick TD game, can't really fault it for not having story, though I could sing its praises if it had a goon one).Sound: No breaking ground stuff here, just a cute jingle to acompany the passage of time. Tower upgrades get some irky lines, not a fan.Graphics: This game looks very much like a smartphone one, maybe it originaly was?

Just play Kingdom Rush again.The gameplay is tower defense standard, of the ""fixed paths and build spots"" sort. Enemies walk along, you shoot them down. Tower variety is somewhat less than usual because most of the options are clearly worse. The answer to most problems is ""more sniper towers.""Fake longevity via repetition and grinding is the main problem. There are only 15 levels. The game tries to extend that with 6 difficulty levels for each map. The achievements try to extend that to a full length game by asking you to repeat that for a literal day, because the last achievement calls for 4x as many kills as all 15 levels at all 6 difficulties."

Short of the quick tutorial, you are left to the slaughter from the get go. I usually enjoy TD games and appreciate a good challenge.The pacing and balance are way off from the start. Normally you would proceed with the levels and upgrade as you go in order to be able to handle the higher levels, this one will give you two maybe three levels and will have you repeating those levels over and over again in order to obtain souls to upgrade (currency for leveling up towers and abilities) I belive this is left over from when this game was a mobile cash cow for real world currency.  Although there is a good deal of strategy to be used in tower placement, this game relies way too heavily of grinding in order to level up the towers enough to barely squeak by to the next level. The grinding has no enjoyment as well, because the upgrades themselves are very lack luster (+4% attack speed, that was well worth playing the same level four times! <--sarcasm btw)It is a shame, the visuals are bright and pleasant with smooth animation and unique characters. Aside from the mind numbing grinding the game play has potential. This COULD HAVE BEEN a wonderful casual game, but if I sit down to play a game it should not feel like work, work is what I am taking a break from."

Dreadful Spammer, Heroes Grave, Napalm Artillery and Eye of corruption. In the last map, i didnt use the heroes grave.So maybe have maps in the future, where its very good to use the other towers etc..Think the game needs a ""Endless Madness"" Challenges. They just keep coming and gets harder as you progress in waves. It first stops when you out of life.Have a leader board on that, who can get the most waves with the skill that are availible.Maybe a random map maker or even a Map editor for players?Also, it would be nice if the whole screen view was in a full windows.LOVE the graphic work witch makes it nice and cosy.

But if you're like me and you're upset with the guys over at KR for going over to mobile devices only, then what better way to stick it to 'em than buy a game here on steam so similiar to theirs?It is a SOLID game with plenty of hours-played in the bang for your buck area. Completionists beware, if you want to get all of the game's rather staggering 98 achievements, be prepared to dump in about 40 hours into this relatively simple game.About six levels in you'll notice that your towers just aren't cutting it anymore. You need to power them up using souls. That is, the currency you get for killing, having leftover gold, earning star ratings and choosing higher difficulties. So yes, there is some grind-factor to be had here, if you want to reach the upper levels. Have fun playing ""The Wastelands"" level over and over for hours (It has the highest soul output for your time in the game, about 2500 per playthrough).That aside, once you've powered up your towers, abilities, and summoned demon you'll be an unstoppable fighting force that the game simply can't keep up with. I guess instead of balancing their towers to be suited for all levels, the devs just thought it would be better to make you stronger for time spent, like a traditional RPG. I don't like the idea, but I understand it.TDLR:-Play Kingdom Rush (also here on Steam) FIRST, and then if you want more play this game too.-This game steals a LOT of concepts, even towers, from Kingdom Rush.-It is a SOLID game and a good example of the genre.-There is going to be some SERIOUS grinding levels if you want everything (5 hours+)-Despite any complaints it's still a strong, functional, well-built game.

Then you'll totally like Evil Defenders!It lies close to Ancient Planet in terms of visual beauty (except the little enemy characters...their faces look like a mouth mated with a potato...play the game and you'll see what I mean!), and sits just belo Prime World: Defenders in upgradablity.Its replayability lies in that upgradability...you can see how long it's taken me for one playthrough (give or take a few hours due to me getting distracted). Towers can be upgraded in game as per normal in this genre, with two tiers of abilities. Like Prime World: Defenders and GemCraft, though, towers also need to be upgraded between levels to boost their performance. The game balances this upgrade path with available currency (which you collect by winning levels), so that you'r pretty much forced to play all available levels to complete the playthrough, which I personally like very much - I'm not into overly-easy games.There are 15 levels with 5 difficulties each, plus a challenge mode. You will need to complete all 6 of these modes per level to fulfil the upgrade path outlined above, so that's quite a lot of gaming right there.I loved the game, and hope there's DLC soon!

If i ever come across a new one i always give it a try and this game is officially one of my favorites. Like most games there are severall difficulties per level and a challenge mode. My favorite part is that you have a skill tree thats always increasing. You can remaster a few levels to get some extra Souls(used to upgrade) and continously improve your towers. The game is also available on mobile but you get the complete game for a single purchase on steam without the need to buy extra levels or drain money on souls to get ahead. would recomend this game to anyone who simply enjoys a good tower defense game.

The monsters can be frustrating as you can't individually target just one, like their healer, and your spells are awkward to aim, clicking the healer with a 'warp back' spell is more likely to warp the guy next to him than the healer.Defender's Quest, Defense Grid, Gemcraft.
