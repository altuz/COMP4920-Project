It gives people the chance to have their efforts seen, and get themselves out there a bit. You never know when a nice little gem will be found.But this is an example of Greenlight gone wrong...It's a simple little platformer, decent enough on the surface, but my god is it infuriating to play.The background is confusing, often making you unsure of what can and can't be stood on, and what will and won't hurt you.The same with objects. Pick up the green swirly things, but don't touch the identical looking pink/white swirly things, because they hurt.Those dangerous looking explosions on the floor? They're perfectly safe bounce pad things!Enemies: They're pretty much all stationary turrets. Some can be destroyed when shot, some can't. No real indication of whether or not one can be until you try.Water will either hurt you, instantly kill you, or allow you to swim in it. The only way to find out which it will be is to jump in!Even the final screen of the game is terrible. It says the end, and tries to thank you for playing, but half of the text goes off the screen! Are you serious??The biggest redeeming feature (if you can call it redeeming) is that there seems to be no lives system, and checkpoints are everywhere, so you never lose much/any progress.So you can push your way through if you have the patience for the horrible level design, and inconsistent mechanics, but there's little reason to..."

,Not Recommended,412600,25519978,"Posted: 15 September, 2016",all,Timrod,"Lup is yet another game in a line of shovelware released by publisher Back to Basics Gaming in an attempt to rake in quick money using steam trading cards. While I cannot say for certain whether it is a Unity asset flip (where a developer purchases cheap models and textures off the Unity Asset Store and attempts to ""flip"" it into a shovelware title for a profit), the possibility certainly exists given how the player character is an undetailed 2D sprite and most of the world is low-polycount 3D models that look like they came from several different artists.This game is a bog-standard shovelware platformer in which you control a poorly-drawn sprite with a gun that fires lag-inducing particle effects, whose ultimate goal is to run through a handful of forgettable stages, avoiding lag-incuding particle effects shot from various enemies (most of which look like turrets taken from a stock Unity asset pack). Getting hit simply reduces your health by a wildly varying amount - most enemies do little damage, but some will kill you in one or two hits seemingly at random - and causes knockback in a random direction. There are also pits and ""lava"", which range in lethality from ""tiny amount of damage and a ton of upwards knockback"" to ""your sprite has gotten stuck, please wait 50 seconds to die"".There are a whole bunch of game mechanics that simply don't matter, from picking up ammo boxes to upgrade your weapon (which seemingly does the same amount of damage regardless of upgrade level) to picking up coins and green orbs that as far as I can tell do absolutely nothing but increase your score.I should also mention that the game's in-game menus do not work properly. There is no way (at least, that I know of) to return to the title screen from inside the game, nor is there a properly working ""exit"" button on the title screen - there is an exit button, but it doesn't actually do anything when clicked.Lup can be finished in as little as 20 to 25 minutes in a casual playthrough. I have 8+ hours in it mostly because I have made poor life choices and chose to speedrun it as a way of increasing the visibility of shovelware on Steam.Overall, this game is garbage and I would recommend that no one purchase anything from Back to Basics Gaming - even for the trading cards."

,Recommended,412600,18717187,"Posted: 27 October, 2015",all,Nefos,"As of this writing I purchased this game on sell for only about 50 cents and for it's price it's a decent platformer. The main challenge of the game that make's it so much more challenging is the fact that when you get hit by an enemy your character gets thrown off. None of that recovery ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It's a tough as nails game and for an Early Access game it's not bad. The atmosphere and art work seems very unique on it's own flavor and doing it's own thing which is completely ok. Also, the controls are surprisingly great. Platforming is pretty challenging as well. The negative? Well, glad you asked! It still feels overall unfinished but of course this is what Early Access is all about! For only 50 cents (literally a pack of gum) you can have some good fun for about an hour or 2 of your time. As it was tough for me to recommend it or not I am finally flipping a coin on this and I definitely recommend Lup. With it's promising gameplay and quirky art I whole-heartedly believe they will get this game launched and this will turn into a pretty decent platformer. Keep up the good work team.Edit: Typos"

,Not Recommended,412600,24586097,"Posted: 28 July, 2016",all,sekambu,"I bought this game for $.06 in a bundle during the summer sale and after completing the game in a half an hour I would say it is worth about that price. There are many issues with this and I only completed it because I was seeing how far I could get by simply running forward and shooting with occasional jumping.The movement is clunky and causes frustration at times even when trying to jump over small obstacles. The combat consists of static turrets that fire from off screen and may or may not be destructable by your gun that inexplicably changes between every area. However, you have an abundant health pool that means you almost never have to worry about actually being hit by the turret.The level design is also inconsistent with some areas having invisible walls and even invisible floors that insta-kill you when you touch them as well as absurd sudden changes in verticallity that keep you feeling lost the entire time. The only real sense of navigation you have is the need to travel right.There is also no real story to this game even though there is some forced dialogue that hints at one and no consistent art style which makes the whole game look much less polished.The only real redeeming quality I found in this game was the soundtrack which contained a surprising number of songs meant to fit the themes of the areas the play over and helped imrpove the mood of the game greatly.Overall I can't recommend this game because the poor gameplay and lack of innovative ideas makes it a pretty repetative slog through confusing levels."

They included walljumping, but hey did it so badly, it's♥♥♥♥♥♥to attempt to use. It's unresponsive and annoying to even walk. Gameplay is hard to understand and the screen is always cramped with weird and distracting things that ping you across the screen and are confusing to look at. Keys feel sticky when moving, and your trail (an aesthetic sin. such an eyesore) follows you round annoyingly. Characters are weird, since you play as a poorly drawn blue thing, with a badly drawn red fedora. Boring, scarce storyline, which only includes another character, who is also badly drawn, looks like a tramp, and has a pink cigarette? You can't even get past him, because he talks to you, and you can't move when he talks. Then, because the jumping mechanic is so badly made, you'll jhave to repeat talking to him again and again.Don't buy this counter-intuitve, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ platformer."
,Recommended,412600,23547173,"Posted: 13 June, 2016",all,AvenDoram,I'll just say I beat the game in 30 minutes. But... this game was really fun. It was a really fun cheap platformer that I'll be coming back to at points. The music was all really good. And the level progression felt pretty nice as well. It's obviously not the best platformer. It does leave you wanting more from it. But it is still a good game. Although the grammar is somewhat weird. Especially with the ending message. But I'd still say it works properly and still provides a decent amount of fun. And I don't normally like platformers.A 6/10 but from the price it's worth it.
