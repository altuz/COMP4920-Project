When I started to play I was like, ""Holy Crap! This is pretty fun!"" Okay, seriously though, this game is pretty fun. I only wish real life was like this. The game was short and sweet, but the other difficulty settings make this game very challenging which it then turns more into a long, drawn out process. The story is cute and the song at the end is a perfect ending to the game. I would recommend this game at it's current price.This was Curated for PC Beta Gaming if you would like to follow us the link is below:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG#curationOnce we have a 100 followers on our group there will be a game giveaway, but only the followers have a chance to win.If you liked this review please give it a thumbs up.

From behind a cloud of noxious gas it emerged, making me retch with laughter and joy. The concept is simple: you must use your flatulence to clear a succession of public places of all human life within a time limit.There are three difficulties, and you must utilize your innate bacterial imbalance with the deftness of a truly stinking tactician. The fact you can buy this title and an accompanying burrito and have change from $5 is also wonderful.A suggestion for the developer: this is a perfect gift title between friends. So if you can implement a slightly discounted four-pack on the Store page, your stanky masterpiece may waft its way into many a personal space."

,Recommended,412620,29307252,Posted: 16 January,all,CrazyCanuck,"OverviewThis game was purchased directly through Steam and is being reviewed by myself personally. This review was not bought or paid for in any way.You’re about to enjoy a tasty burrito when you see the girl of your dreams drop her phone. She disappears, but you need to find her phone to track this woman down, presumably so you can have fart children together. In order to find the phone, you need to clear out the burrito restaurant. Now, asking people to politely move is just unheard of in this day and age, so what do you do? You fart, of course! Lots of farting. Some wet, I assume.CropDuster Supremeis a 99 cent game, so you can obviously assume that there isn’t much to it. And there isn’t. You use WASD to move, and spacebar to fart. Or d-pad to move and pretty much every other button but start to do your business. You move around the various locations, farting at people to get them to leave. The goal of each level is to clear it of all people. Starts off easy with 20-odd people at the burrito place, then you need to clear a couple hundred from the airport.You have two bars you need to take care of; gas and time. Your gas depletes the more you fart, so you’ll want to chain together the disgust of people to build up combos. A combo of ten will instantly refill your meter. If you can’t chain ten, maybe because people are spread around, you can run over the randomly spawning burritos that will fill it for you.Your other piece of management is time. Each level has a time limit that continues from the previous one. If you complete the burrito restaurant with 15 seconds left, you’ll begin the parking lot with only having 15 seconds of time. Running over the clock powerups will increase your time. If you do run out of time, you don’t restart the game, you simply restart the level itself. This is all based on the default difficulty, which is Toot. I have not tried it on Fart or Shart difficulties. Man, it’s actually kind of hard to write this with a straight face.And that’s the game. Work your way from restaurant to airport to wedding and marry the girl of your dreams.ProsVery easy achievements for those who achievement huntWell worth the 99 cents (or $1.09 in CanuckBucks)Amusing albeit short lived gameplayActually has a story! Of love and farts(Trading cards now work after the developer had been notified of the issue)ConsNo variety whatsoeverOnce finished, it’s finished, no replay valueAs of this review date (Jan 16, 2017), trading cards are either broken or do not existSummaryThe cons are, to be honest, not really cons. They are the “bad” parts about this game, but it’s also one whole dollar, they’re to be expected. Unless you download this and never play it, you will, no question, get your money’s worth. Besides, if trading cards are added at some point, you’re bound to make back a quarter of the cost at least."

,Not Recommended,412620,30275064,Posted: 2 March,all,䷃䷋䷃䷏䷀ ䷴䷼䷝,"I'm going to use the cliche ""there are two kinds of people..."" to open this review.There are two kinds of people, those who find farts absolutely hillarious. Who should probably buy this game regardless of what i have to say about it. And those who don't, who should obviously stay away and probably didn't make it as far as this review anyway. But then I guess there are sane, sensible people who could find fart humour funny in context. And such people should continue reading...The context is a game which is either far to easy, or on the hardest level sometimes impossible to complete due to various randomly generated things, including the path that people take to evacuate the location which can mean that someone who you farted on right at the beginning of the level could potentially still be stuck behind a piece of scenery long after everyone else has cleared the joint.Not really a game so much as a long winded fart joke, worth a laugh but not a dollar.No challenge really despite the unwinnable situations, as evidenced by the fact I was able to clear the final level on the shart difficulty on my first attempt due to lucky RNG.6.7/10 (And yes I did intend the long-winded pun:)"

,Recommended,412620,29302577,Posted: 16 January,all,MastaCody of 99 Cent Gaming,"I personally purchased this game. I reviewed it for my 99 Cent Gaming series.When I logged into Steam today looking for another game to review for my series, I never thought I'd be hit in the face with a game like CropDuster Supreme. Unphased, I let the gust of insipration take me through the entire game in one video to see if it was worth the dollar or if it was just full of hot musky air...CropDuster Supreme is a game that is very very simple in it's execution. Every level has the player tasked with clearing out rooms by using your powers of flatulence on demand, aiming to hit as many people as possible with your clouds of stench. On top of the number of people you need to clear is a timer that counts down to 0 making you restart the level if the room isn't cleared in time. You also have a limited number of on demand toots you can use before running out of those as well.There are two power ups to help which are the clock (which adds time) and the burrito (which adds more ammo). These seem to pop up at random but definitely help out when you really need them the most. I've found myself at the tail end of a level with a couple of people to go screaming ""where is a clock?!"" and having it pop up just in time. Pun intented.There were a few couple of things that caused me to get a little frustrated which I want to point out before getting to the verdict. First was the combo system. Now it may have been because I went into the game blind and bought it right as I saw the release, but I had no idea how the combos worked. Every so often I would see the word COMBO and sometimes with a x2 or x3 but I couldn't figure out how I was getting them. At one point in the game it tells you getting a x10 combo refills your bar. I managed to complete the entire game without once reaching that amount, so it's not necessary to beating it...but I do wish that there was some way of knowing how it could have happened.The other thing that caused frustration was losing myself in the crowds. There were a few levels that had a ton of people you had to clear out, and once the chaos began it was too easy to get lost in the shuffle. I evenutally found myself after stopping to really look, but I think having some sort of identifier or indication of where your character is at all time would bring down the frustration level.Outside of those two things, I have to say the game brought me pretty decent entertainment for what I purchased. Now granted the game was very short (it took me about 30 minutes to complete) but it was fully featured, bug free (from what I played), grammar was on point and I want to support developers who manage to do that. I've also not played the higher difficulties yet and can only imagine the insanity that it will bring.I have more to say and reactions to give in my video below, but overall...is the game worth .99? Absolutely! It's a fun distraction, and with the game being in Early Access I hope the developers take notice with the two points of frustration I encountered and work in things like a combo explination tutorial and a player identifier. I'd love to revisit this as updates are made.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7dCikAdMcU"
