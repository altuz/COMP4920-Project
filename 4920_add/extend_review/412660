The visuals are playful and colorful, with a color palette that I have absolutely fallen in love with. The gameplay is challenging but fair, meaning that I, a person with no rythm, will have a few hiccups. But this is one of those rythm games that I can really dig, and try to get better at. Give it a go!*Longer review will be written when I have played more of it*"

Even when it gets you into a trance and you're going along without really realizing it. It's as enjoyable as when I played it at PAX West.My only complaint is the levels are very short which breaks up the song. Once you get into the groove, there's a loading screen which breaks the rhythm and takes you out of the game.There's also a few syncing issues, but nothing that is game ruining.Get it if you are a fan of these types of games or enjoys some good trance-ish music."

Every level feels unique. Boss battles are nice and ads new elements.Has bonus levels after completion and an additional difficoult level.There's an ingame lobby where you can listen to the music.The cutscenes are gorgeous!!Cons:The skill pacing is challenging, practise makes perfect. (this could be concidered a pro)Character movement feels slightly slow or delayed at times.The laser-beam is unforgiving, almost always killing you in one blow, personally for me breaking some of the immersion.Wish the game had an endless mode to get more of that rythm vibe, it feels abit short.Side notes:Recommend using a controllerSpent ca 4 hours on the storylineMesmerizing experience,definitely recommend this game!"

76561198068786161,Not Recommended,412660,26423473,"Posted: 4 November, 2016",all,[SSound] Astrodude80,"Is the idea of the game fantastic?  Absolutely!Can I recommend this exact game?  No.The execution needs a lot of work (mainly heavy stuttering, which is #1 on the list of things that should NEVER happen under ANY circumstance for a rhythm game).  In addition, lining up more than just the immediate next action NEEDS TO BE THERE and it's not (unless you know what to look for).  E.g. in Rockband you see every single note coming at you down the track.  In Klang you only see a timer for the immediate next action.  Is the next action only an 8th beat away so you have less than a beat to respond because you didn't see the teeny-tiny marker coming at you?  TOUGH LUCK.That being said, most of the game is good.  The mechanics are solid, the graphics (when they're not stuttering) look amazing, the soundtrack is of course amazing.  It's just a few execution issues that just completely kill it for me."
,Recommended,412660,29892215,Posted: 12 February,all,CloudAran,"While a creative combination Klang's two components (platforming and rhythm games) are sometimes at odds. When it works well it's a frenetic combination with appealing visuals and an aural delight, but the soundtrack can make reading a strong rhythm difficult, filtering visual input can be a real pain with the intense trippy visuals, and at its worst Klang feels like trying to simultaneously play two very different games at the same time, rather than a seamless fusion. Especially when an option to help you recover and not be punished MORE for faltering once is turned off by default. Also, don't expect a story to match the fun tunes, interesting character design and visual polish. It's an interesting ride, but hardly worth mentioning there even is a premise.If the concept of the combination has you intrigued, check this one out, but I'd recommend considering turning on ""Reflex mode"" (slow mo when you miss a 'klang' - the game's DDR arrow projectiles) and actually give ""casual"" difficulty a second thought if you're not confident in both your platforming and rhythm game skills. I beat the game on normal in an evening, (~3.6 hours) but the challenging bits felt more frustrating than a rewarding challenge to overcome, and the post-story challenges were demoralizing without dropping to casual. Again, having Reflex mode on lessened this effect, since it provides a sorely needed recovery mechanism, rather than failure leading to several consequences that made missing the next action more likely.An imperfect execution, but a marvelous idea and a neat new genre fusion none the less."

A bit frustrating in the beginning, but when you get used to the controls, it's a blast.The visuals are very simplistic in a good way. It can be a bit much on the screen to catch every direction you'll need to block/Attack, but it's just a small detail. And don't forget, the music, really well composed to fit the game.If you like a great platformer/Rythm game, and good music, this is a must buy.And it's Cheap!"
,Recommended,412660,30283900,Posted: 2 March,all,Infamous Wes,"The platforming is fun, as the game introduces new concepts at a regular pace to keep the action fresh. My biggest gripe is that the rhythm and the timing of the inputs sometimes feel like they don't match up - it's something I'm hoping they patch for the future. The real selling point is the soundtrack, which I would 100% recommend picking up with the game. Overall, this is a really cool indie title that is very much worth the investment."
,Recommended,412660,34962530,Posted: 14 September,all,Caboose,"I bought this game becaus bLiNd is one of my favorite EDM artists.  I think this game can best be summed up as a Rage-Rythm-Platformer.  Imagine your right hand playing DDR and your left hand playing an action-platformer at the same time; now imagine that with rave music blasting and someone has a strobe light that is cycling colors going crazy in your face.  That is what playing Klang is like.  If you think that sounds cool (and it is) there are some things to consider first.I did beat the game on normal but this game is difficult.  Unfortunately I feel like a lot of the difficulty is artificial and comes more from the volume of audio and visual noise tripping up your brain as you're trying to multitask.  Again, it's like playing DDR but you're also having to maneuver your character around on platforms and/or constantly dodging beams that either insta-kill you or cause an obscene amount of damage.  To make matters worse, when you get a combo above a certain amount it changes the color scheme of everything on screen so by the time you readjust you're likely to be taking damage and drop the combo (ironically taking you back to the color scheme you just left as well).  A lot of the time I would die and not even realize what killed me due to the sheer amount of crap on the screen whizzing by (looking at you Angel boss).  The bosses in general are just a mess and I actually found it easier to fight them when I turned the game sound off.  That should never happen in a rythm-based game.There were also some technical issues as well.  The cutscenes, though beautiful, would experience lag spikes even though the game itself was fine.  Platforms in levels that are programmed to fall so you don't wait on them too long would sometimes instantly fall without giving the player a chance to move but other times would give you the normal 1-2 second window to actually keep moving.  I actually soft-locked the game once by skipping a cutscene.  Luckily there was a checkpoint right at the start of the cutscene but still...Despite all this I have to give the game its due.  The soundtrack is FANTASTIC, bLiNd really outdid himself on this project and you can actually unlock the music tracks if you just want to listen to them later on.  Visually the game is beautiful with vibrant colors that really draw you into this weird rave world.  The story makes no sense but that seems intentional and I honestly didn't mind it being left open to interpretation; I kind of got a God of War feel from it honestly.  While short it should provide enough of a challenge to keep people playing for hours on end to even just finish it.The gameplay is pretty good overall as well.  Somehow Tinimations turned DDR into an action-platformer and made it work well.  The controls were pretty responsive and apart from some parts where I questioned a hitbox and the slide mechanic, it handled better than some AAA games I've played that also rely on controls being precise.  The wall jump mechanic is pretty cool as well and it enabled the game to do some pretty interesting and diverse things in the levels.  And while I did slag off on the mess of visuals a little bit ago there are levels that are much more just about hitting the ""notes"" or hitting the ""notes"" with just a little bit of platforming thrown in and these are great.I feel as though if some of the visual mess were to be toned down and some of the death beams ease up a little, this game would be a definite recommendation by me to anyone.  As it stands though, while I did enjoy it overall there are parts I never want to play again, chief among these are the bosses.  If you like EDM music and want a novel game that will challenge you and maybe make you frustrated, give it a shot."

Although the reflex mode I feel harms the player more than helps; take off the training wheels and you'll do better! The character can feel slightly sluggish during some boss fights that require you to turn around very quickly, or keep up with something. Otherwise, no real complaints for this fun little indie game!Let's Play:https://youtu.be/FYrVd9sOTLM"
,Recommended,412660,25730858,"Posted: 27 September, 2016",all,MouseClicker3000,"Klang is not much of a story based game but I'll try to summarize it:""Klang is a game about a person who is seeking great power from the all seeing eye. Solus however stopped Klang and threw him to the bottom of the world, forcing Klang to go and fight for what he seeks.""When I played the demo at EGX 2016 (and even the prologue in the full game), it was quite a challenge for me playing this for the first time. This game is clearly for gamers who are good at multi-tasking. You use WASD for movement and the arrow keys for attacking (however you can use a controller instead). But later on, you will face new gameplay styles and you will die many times. All of the gameplay styles you will encounter throughout your game session will collaberate into one hard trial that you will need strong fingers to play with. Trust me. I have died 100+ times, mostly on the dissapearing platforms section at Angel City.Now visually I like the style of a futuristic setting along with some musical elements. I like the choice of genre, even the choice of the artist bLiNd. The beats really help keeping you focus on attacking.I have finished the game in over 2 hours, but I can see some replayability with it. After you finish Hardcore Mode, you will unlock Nightcore Mode. I haven't went on Nightcore Mode yet but I will look forward to it.I know people would complain that the game is ""too hard to play"" but that's a stupid excuse. It was meant to test your multi-tasking and skill in both rhythm and platforming.I don't have anything bad to say about the game other than a few bugs I have encountered that could be fixed through an update. I'd highly recommend this game to any gamers who likes rhythm games, platformers, speedrunning, or even a hardcore challenge."

,Recommended,412660,25758456,"Posted: 28 September, 2016",all,Skoolbus,"What is Klang?In a nutshell, it's a rhythm based platformer, that will have you wielding two tuning fork swords as you run, jump, slide, and slash your way through a hectic, unrelenting, EDM world.Early on, the game starts off rather simple, letting you get a hang of the controls. Soon however, you will be doing everything at once, as Klang does not waste time getting going. The first major boss battle is a decent step up in difficulty, but it is the second boss where Klang gets going and does not let up. This game gets quite hard, and I found myself dying quite a bit. Fortunately, the game has a fast respawn and good checkpoint system, allowing you to get right back into the action without a lot of down time. For the short runtime of the campaign, this game runs hard and fast. Once you complete the basic campaign, though, there are plenty of addtional challenges for you to take on.That is not to say the game is without flaws. Some inputs in the game do not line up exactly with the beat, causing you to miss hits seemingly at random in places. In addition, the flashing colors and constant motion can get distracting. This especially true when you miss a note, as every change in multiplier includes a change in color scheme, which can cause you to lose track of what is coming next and create a series of missed notes. And of course, the actual campaign for the game is quite short, so if you cannot get involved in extra content or challenge modes, you may feel cheated.Overall, I can highly recommend this game and am looking forward to seeing what issues that do exist be fixed to create a stellar game."

And let me say, the drops during boss fights were awesome.No this is not super detailed. Yes I do not care.And a note on the story: There's not much pre-game story, but what I've heard, and I think I'm quoting, ""Play as an elite rave warrior trying to evade the grasp of Soundlord Sonus."" So, evil overlord, warrior from a different regime trying to escape said evil overlord. That's what I've got."
76561198026410504,Recommended,412660,35255497,Posted: 27 September,all,Mr. Hustler the Jimmy Rustler,"This game is a really REALLY cool concept. Rhythm and platforming are 2 genres that I never expected to be this fun.The art in this game is truly really cool, and it's unfortunate that it's moving so quickly because I really wish I could fully appreciate it all. The music is rockin', and it fits the theme of the game perfectly.And then there's the gameplay. Sort of a love/hate relationship in my opinion. Again, the concept is awesome, but there are few things about the execution that I wanted to be more fleshed out. These minor things are marked under the game's difficulty, but at some points they were frustrating.- The indicator to show you the next action is on the smaller side, and unless you change options it's very hard to see in some color palettes the game brings to the table.- There were times where I thought for sure I was pressing the indicator at the right time with the music, but found out it was slightly off. This could be me not catching what beat the hits were on within the main rhythm, but very often it felt just slightly out of sync.Any other gripe I would have about this game is nitpicking. Overall the dev did an amazing job of bringing this concept to life, and it really is a trip. Somewhat short, but amazing for completionists/perfectionists. Buy this for either a short, thrilling ride or a longer, more challenging experience.Overall 8/10, looking forward to putting more hours in."
