Your body will want to punch orbs on the beat, or on the off-beat, or at least on some logical division of a beat. Instead the game throws orbs at you in formations that...sort ofcorrespond to the beat? But not quite? I tried a variety of instrumental songs with driving beats, which you'd think would work great, but the sloppy arrangement and randomly fluctuating speed of the orbs made it impossible to find a groove.I'm sympathetic to the technical challenges involved, but good beat detection has been possible for a while (see e.g. Crypt of the NecroDancer). Whatever Audioshield is doing, it only seems to find the beat by accident. Going by the reviews, plenty of people are okay with this, but I personally find it hard to recommend."

If you're a rhythm game junkie like me and you like to have the notes totally in sync then you're not going to enjoy playing the songs with this. The notes that come to you really just don't make sense, you basically just move your arms to the correct sides that you need to while listening to music in the background.Cool idea, cool graphics and it's not like it's not fun - it can be!

Try having a friend act as DJ on the PC while you're in VR!That said, it could use a few updates. The GUI could use a little polish, the local search doesn't often pull up the file results, and we could use some more different shields and maps.Overall, this game is a blast and a workout.

76561197996709224,Recommended,412740,22634940,"Posted: 25 April, 2016",all,Shady,"In spite of it feeling like an incomplete game, what we get is still a lot of fun.The base game is great. It does a good job of keeping with the beat of the songs and I am really getting into the songs. This game will likely keep me entertained for many more hours, and is worth the price to me in spite of its flaws.There is certainly a wide list of what could be improved with it however, so I really really hope the devs are still working on it.My biggest complaint would be to have the orbs to come in at a much shallower angle. After playing 2-3 songs where I'm looking up most of the time, my neck really starts to get sore. To make up for the reduced angle of attack from above, I would recommend also allowing orbs to come from below the horizon as well (this obviously means you will have to remove the floor from in front of you)I would also like some colorblind support, as I can barely tell the difference between the blue and the purple (at the very least, make the purple much darker so there is more contrast between the two colors.It is also a bit buggy. Opening the keyboard will sometimes mess with and disable the pointer on the controllers and you can no longer point and ""click"" on anything in game or in the steam overlay menu until you completely reboot the VR.It also sometimes crashes but no so much as to ruin the experience (only twice in the six hours I played, but that is still two more than any other VR titles I've played).I really appreciate the option of adding a guest name for score keeping, but I do wish that it would not overwrite the high score of the main steam account if the guest's score is higher. But at least there is a solution by having every user use a guest name.Lastly, I would like for there to be even harder difficulties. While the ""Harder"" difficulty can still be challenging and fun, I want there to be a difficulty where I actually have to struggle to get over 90%. Perhaps implement some actual roomscale functionality by having us actually have to move our feet to dash left and right to hit out of reach orbs."
76561198240953710,Recommended,412740,29961417,Posted: 16 February,all,lucidvr,"VR can be life-changing.Thanks largely to this game I have improved stamina, flexibilty, renewed my appreciation of various music genres, and acquired some dance moves beyond raptor arms.I'm still fatter, older, and achier than I'd like, but I can occasionally escape to tron mode, where popping bubbles is all.For prospective purchasers - anyone with at least two arms can enjoy this game at the lower levels, but the simpler algorithm can lead to a perceived lack of on-beat orbiness.The 'harder' and 'elite' levels match up much better. At these levels only tracks using novelties like a sudden stop/start or reverse samples can become frustrating. Pretty much anything else with a defined beat will be fun.I prefer 'harder', which makes you swing your pants, and everything else, for the activity score. Elite provides activity points by upping the orbage and pattern diffuculty a bit, often becoming an all-arm twitch-fest. Different strokes, I guess.As far as improvements - of course we can hope for more of everything - modes/backgrounds etc., but it's a fantastic, well-balanced game as it stands, and I'd rather the dev put his time and experience into Audioshield 2, with a view to the capabilities of next-gen VR hardware.The only small addition I think the game really needs is display of the physical activity mark to differentiate 10/10 scores on the leaderboard."

,Recommended,412740,32551787,Posted: 18 June,all,Syrsly,"Audioshield is fun and well worth the price, but...Pros:Music library is virtually limitless!  Use your own songs! This freedom is easily the best part of this game.The stages are abstract and can make it easy to focus on the music.  I personally prefer the type of stages you'd find in Beats Fever, but this is at least less likely to lag.Great optimizations and a professional level polish to the menu UI.  Everything is easy to understand and runs smoothly on both my Phenom II X4 955 and my Ryzen 1600X, though I find that the YouTube streaming hiccups a lot on my older hardware, pausing every 30-45 seconds to buffer.Recommendations seem to be on-point a lot of the time with fast-paced songs and songs which just sound really cool.  When I bought this, I kept telling myself I would use my own mp3 library, but I find it easier to just play the recommended songs from YouTube.  The YouTube songs often come with lyrics, too, which is a nice bonus.Cons:Note orbs often do not fit the music.  Note orbs move eradically, pausing for no particular reason and moving at different speeds to hinder your timing.  I prefer notes move toward you at a constant speed so I can plan ahead.The difficulty levels can be very hard or very easy and often not anywhere inbetween.  I found the game too easy and not fun enough unless I played in Harder or higher difficulty, but some songs aren't as accurate as others and the difficulty settings are there to help alleviate that.I found myself getting worn out trying to swing my arms into the right position to get the right color, because the colors of notes and their position are totally random.You're limited to just 3 stages, and they're mostly abstract scenery, aside from the concert stage, which is decidedly low quality.  I would like to see different levels of quality for each stage and more stages to choose from.  I'd be happy to pay for that as a DLC, too.There's no way to add your own custom note tracks for songs from what I can tell.  It would be really cool to see user-generated tracks for popular songs.Overall, this game is great.  Audioshield gives me a lot more replay value than Beats Fever does.  It's a good buy, even at full price, but definitely consider other music games, too!"
,Recommended,412740,33524000,Posted: 13 July,all,TurtleSquared,"A ""must have"" for every VR libraryUpon my vive's arrival, I bought this game along with others (like job sim) with the expectation that I'd spend 3 hours max in this game. I was pleasantly surprised that this game is alot better than my expectations figured.This game is based around music, as you can tell by 'audio'shield. Many reviews below me complain about the game's lack of mapping to the beat, in which I say they've either only played on the lowest difficulty (the least amount of orbs to hit, therefore lacking the beat), only played on♥♥♥♥♥♥♥songs that dont have a defined beat, or a combination of the two.It's really quite simple when it comes to the 'audio-tracking.' Pick a song with a defined beat and you'll be fine. Pick something thats either incredibly slow or muffled, and the program will have some difficulty.I reccommend this game fully. However, if you're having some difficulty finding songs, start with these 3:1. Queen - Dont Stop Me Now2. Caravan Palace - Lone Digger3. The Black Keys - Tighten Up"
,Recommended,412740,23033516,"Posted: 17 May, 2016",all,Angrytiger,"My relationship with Audioshield is very much of the love/hate variety.The game is prone to crashes, has a painfully broken user interface, and is rife with bugs and glitches that may put off the most intensely competitive gamers. That said, it is my most-played VR title so far, and I find myself returning to it again and again for more physical fun.The basic premise is that blue and orange orbs, synced* (*to some extent -- see Bad-3 below) to any music you insert into the program, come flying towards you in the virtual world. You use your two Vive controllers to fend off these orbs; the controllers correspond to shields of the same color in your left and right hands, respectively. On some occasions, a purple 'composite' orb will appear, and you have to combine your two shields into one by putting them together physically or pulling both controllers' triggers.Scores are awarded for number of notes hit (""Technical"" score) and amount of physical activity done during the song (""Artistic"" score). Global leaderboards are already filling up with people getting ~9.9X Technical scores (hit 99.X% of notes in the song), with Artistic score serving as the tiebreaker.The Good:The fact that you can plug in virtually any song of any genre you want is spectacular. Like its cousins Audiosurfs 1 and 2 (made by the same developer, no less), Audioshield uses a beatmapping algorithm to make 'stages' based entirely on the tempo and sound of the song you choose. If you want an intense, high-speed experience, play a high-tempo EDM song; if you want to just chill out, put on some alt rock or country or something like that.Limited Soundcloud integration means that you can often find music to play even if your own library is sparse. The system is currently somewhat broken, though, as only a small selection of songs from Soundcloud are available compared to if you searched for them through a browser.There's a decent, if not terribly amazing, variety in the ways to play. Three different shield shapes means three different techniques to learn/use (or pick one that is your favorite and stick with it). Three different difficulty levels (Normal, Hard, and Harder in ascending order of difficulty) provide different levels of orb generation and complexity (amount of ""crossover"" notes requiring you to reach a blue orb on the right side of the play area, for example).The Bad:The UI is completely broken. There's no SteamVR integration, meaning that you can't pull up the keyboard in game like with other VR games; this means that to look up Soundcloud titles, or leave a message under your scoreboard entry (if any), you need to return to your computer's traditional keyboard. And then, even once you're at your computer, you have to deal with a finicky cursor that doesn't really seem to click on what it's actually pointed at.Using songs from Soundcloud is easy enough, but the game has an odd tendency to crash every so often (every other song or so, and that's not even exaggeration) when doing so. I'm guessing this has something to do with downloading the track.The algorithm for beatmapping isslightlybetter than Audiosurf 2's, but in the end it is still an imperfect product. Unless you use songs with strong, definitive beats, it's hard to get a track where you feel like you're movingwiththe song the whole time. And then, the only way to get this feeling is to play on the hardest difficulty setting (Harder).The skill ceiling is easily reached, and while some users have created mods to make tracks even more aggressive, I would argue that they are an imperfect solution to what would be better solved with better beatmapping.Crashes and instability in general. I don't think I've ever played a game that crashed so often for so long. It'll sometimes crash when restarting a song partway through; it'll sometimes crash when starting a song in the first place. It'll sometimes crash on startup. Of my ~20 hours of playtime as of this review (25 recorded, but I've left the program running while rendering videos), I would estimate about an hour of that total was spent having to go back to my computer and stop the Audioshield process and restart it. That may seem like a small amount of instability, but you can really feel it when you're trying to just play a song (or keep replaying a song for points) and the game spontaneously decides it has no interest in continuing to work anymore.Score and points are relatively meaningless. There's no point-tracking in-song, there's no 'perfect hits' where you hit notes JUST when they should be hit, etc., any of the things usually associated with rhythm/music games. Leaderboard battles mainly end up as struggles to edge out people by .1% of a technical score, and if a song's top players are all 10.0s, you have to struggle to get a higher artistic score.Also, artistic score is a very vague and poorly-defined/tracked metric. Apparently it can be gamed by waving the remotes around very aggressively whenever you get a 'break' in the song, or at the end of the song.Yet despite all that... it's a lot of fun. There's a visceral joy in combining grooving to music with a game-type scoring system (even one as barebones as this). It's also an unquestionably physical experience, especially when you use high-powered music that requires a lot of movement (see my YouTube video at the end of this for an idea of what I mean by mentioning the physicality). Despite its flaws, if you enjoy music, or enjoy rhythm games with lots of movement (Just Dance in the modern age, DDR and its ilk a decade ago), this is a perfect fit for your $800 toy.Here is the video I mentioned."
,Recommended,412740,22263112,"Posted: 5 April, 2016",all,SkippyKJ,So far my favorite VR game.  Hope to see other games use more haptic feedback in the controllers.  Fluid mechanics give an amazing show.  Minor complaint: Wish you could swat the color blobs more but your shields can't move too fast or it counts as a miss.  Sometimes crashes after finishing a song but I assume that will be patched in time.  After only an hour I only want to play in the hard modes and I work up a light sweat.

That's pretty dang important for a game.-Lets you listen to any song you want!-Works well, didn't encounter too many bugs, if any.-A nice physical activity game that doesn't involve TOO much physical activity. You keep active, but it's not as exhausting as something like Dance Dance Revolution (unless of course you play the hard modes in which case you're a maniac). I like to start my day with it from time to time to wake me up and get the blood flowing.-Good game that you can just hop into, play for a few minutes, then hop out if you want. Which also makes it good for showing it to friends.CONS:-I'm not sure why but the sprites in this game (The orbs, if you will) are blurry.-If you play a song from the internet who's file you don't already have on your computer, and nobody's ever played it before, the game will take a while (as long as the duration of the song, to be percise) to ""Create"" the level for it.-The computer generated levels are usually pretty good, but they are random and are based on the computer's understanding of what the song is like. This leaves me sorely wanting a level editor, so that people can make levels based on actual choreography or the flow of the song, rather than just procedurally generated beats and long notes.Plus it would help minimize the time when notes sneak on you by hiding behidn other notes, or by showing up on the opposite edge of the play area than where you're facing.-No ability to see how well you did previous times on a level.-It seems fairly easy to get a score above 9 on normal mode, regardless of how good you are. The actual difference is usually in the numbers after the decimal point.-I wanted to record this game for a Youtube video but the desktop display of it is portrait oriented, rather than landscape for some reason. Not easy to record.Final verdict: Fun. Simple. Needs more features in my opinion, but worth buying if it's on sale or if you're really into this sort of game."
,Recommended,412740,23761621,"Posted: 24 June, 2016",all,DarkStarSword,"It's ok... but it uses the same algorithm as audiosurf, which is very hit or miss as to how well it synchronises with a given track - I'm a Symphonic Power Metalhead, and I found that some tracks such as Sober by Voyager (♥♥♥♥ing awesome track by a ♥♥♥♥ing awesome band!) synchronised reasonably well and felt satisfying to play, but others like Vampire by Xandria just had no feeling of the music at all and the game actually detracted from the music.One annoying thing I found trying to play Metal tracks was that the intensity of the music almost always made the game spawn orbs from their maximum height, which just led to me craning my head to look towards heaven and my neck getting sore - and not the good kind of sore from headbanging, which is rather impossible to do in this game.I'd also criticise that the orb positioning, which also has no (apparent) link to the music and seemed quite random. The game also had an annoying tendancy to do a sweep with one arm, followed immediately by another orb of that same colour/arm over the other side, which you often can't see in time because the orbs in the sweeping movement block the view of it. For that matter, I'd like an option to turn off the colours - I just want to enjoy my music and not really care about which arm I'm supposed to use for which orb.To be honest, if you just want to hang out in VR and dance to your favourite music just load up a custom environment in SteamVR and use the light saber models to replace the controllers - this kept me entertained for hours the other night :-pIf you want a good VR rhythm game I'd recommend checking out Holodance as well as (or instead of) this one - it doesn't allow you to load up your own music, but it IS perfectly synchronised and you really feel the music."
,Recommended,412740,32488890,Posted: 16 June,all,Wolfknife_Larry,"Bottom line up front this is a fun game that gets you up and moving, HOWEVER, it doesn't work as advertised. For a rhythm game, it really has a hard time keeping the onscreen obstacles with the rhythm.I've seen reviews saying it crashes and freezes, I haven't had one issue with it so far, runs perfect for me. I've also seen reviews saying it's a great work out and you'll have sweat running down your face, maybe if you're in very poor shape, like don't normally move around much shape.This is a game that is on the highest rated VR games and best sellers, so I maybe put a little too much stock in and set my expiations too high on the ""puts you at the point of impact for every hit in your music"" tag line. So that’s what I was expecting, something that kept time and felt like I was visually playing the music. I tried popular music, recommended music from the game, most popular songs used, my own downloaded music and any every list in the game to see if it got any better. But it’s only accurate when there’s heavy beat with little to no other instruments or music in the song.When the song picks up, the game is just all over the place. Not really throwing the obstacles with the beat or rhythm, just throwing random balls and whatever as what I'm assuming is the software losing track of what's going on. That’s what I’m also assuming about this game, it’s just trying to “guess” what to display on screen based on the song selected. But it seems like the software has a hard time trying to determine what to do most of the time and you just end up hitting random bubbles out of rhythm.As most songs pick up you just find yourself playing a whack a mole game to a song you picked instead of an actual rhythm game. Usually in the intro and outro of most songs it keeps the beat and rhythm very well. Though, the game does substitute the lack of accuracy with the bubbles staying on beat with having the speed of them change with the tempo of the music, that's what the game does best in my opinion.But the game is fun, even out of rhythm and beat you're often challenged with the left right left left oh right again, nope wrong color game play. As the bubble obstacles zoom in to your position you end up just reacting at times like something is actually coming at you, so the game does a very good job with the depth and feel of it all.I know it sounds like I’m bashing the game, but don't get me wrong, I really did enjoy playing the game. I was having fun but something seemed off. That does hamper on the “fun” of it as you find yourself just punching randomness to a song you picked instead of going with the rhythm of the song you picked.Do I recommend this game? SureDo I think it's a bit over rated? DefinitelyI'd give it a 7 out 10 for being a rhythm game that can't keep up with the real rhythm."

The concept of this game may seem too short for $20, but trust me, it's not.  This is probably the most addicting VR game that I own because you can search youtube for literally any song or play one of the popular songs and try to get to the top of the leaderboard.To sum this up (and make this review less tedious to read) here is a list of pros and cons with this game:PROS:-Super fun-Infinite new songs to play-Really good workout (there has actually been someone who has done a short study on how many calories you burn in vr games and this is one of those games that he did the study on.  Here is the link to the article that I found about it:https://uploadvr.com/best-htc-vive-games-excercise/)-Wide veriety of difficulties: Casual, Normal, Hard, Harder, and Elite for any level of challenged and sweaty you want to be-You can rock out to the pokemon theme song along with my personal favorite, ""We Are Number One""-The graphics and effects are really cool-There are pvarious types of shields and environments to fit your liking-You can search for a song from either in the game or from your computer with ease meaning if someone is trying it out you can set it up for them, or if you are alone and don't want to take your headset off to look at your computer you can just do a youtube search from inside the game-You can comete against others and get creative with your movements to earn more pointsCONS:-You can't play for as long as you probably would like to; it gets really tiring and you get really sweaty after a while.-As I said, this game can be really tiring if you are playing on a more intense difficulty.  If you hate moving this probably isn't for you, but even though it gets tiring it is so worth it and so fun-The sweat. Preare to have waterfalls coming down your nose.  You might have to take off the headset to wipe your face between games if you are playing on a hard dificulty.I've seen other people say that the notes aren't exactly in line with the song.  This is sortof true because it is auto-generated, so instead of the noted being in line with the lyrics I have noticed that they tend to be more in line with the actual notes, pitch, and volume.  This may sound bad if you havn't played the game, but this didn't really effect the expirience to me.  In fact, it sometimes even made the game more fun and made me feel more badass even thogh I deep down know that I probably look ridiculous in real life.FINAL THOUGHTS:I 100% reccomend this game.  This is probably my favorite vr game, and that's going up against games like vanishing rhealms, the lab, rec room, the blu, and many others that I own and I've only had this game for a day or so! I Havn't found any problems that are too bad so far and I love, love, LOVE this game.PS: The only time I write long reviews is when I really like or dislike something."

In comparison, the content of this VR experience is light for $20.  The price is acceptable ONLY because the VR game  market is so thin, and filled with so many pitfalls, that this game stands out as somewhat quality in comparison.  That's not really a vote in the plus column for this game as it is a sigh of disappoint for the current state of VR as of writing this review, but there it is...In my opinion, Audioshield is more striking just above what I'd consier a minimum bar of quality.  A more fair price point for this game, based on it's mechanics and level of depth, would be about $5.  If this game wasn't VR, and was a trypical ""flat"" game, you'd probably be some free bowser based game with a lot more depth.  Just looking at the game from a mechanic standpoint, you will find it has trouble syncing with a lot of songs, and it's missing some cool obvious features such as letting users create their own modified song syncs to share with friends, etc.The graphics are ""ok"", not great, definatley not polished like The Lab.  There are only two scenes to listen / interact music with, when there could easily be more.  There's no kind of actual progression, no co-op, it's really just a bare bones experince.  In my time with the game, it also crahed often, sometimes forcing me to restart SteamVR.Still, given the rough state of many VR titles, I'm going to thumb this game up.  With all the negatives above, it is still immersive and fun.  When you load up one your personal favorite music scores, and you get into that virutal world that doens't seem at all that interesting in flat videos on the store poge, you'll find a TOTALLY different world and expereince in VR.  Then kicks in the highs and lows of yoru favorite song, and honestly, you could be in for a surprisingly  emotional experience.  It's prtobably just the music of your favorite track thundering in the background  ...but either way, it's about that time you might think this game was maybe actually worth the $20.It's also worth mentionging this is the kind of game tha draws in non-gamers, such as your mother in-law, etc.  Just load up their favroite song, and watch them be wow'd to the immersion of VR.  The clear excersize / activity you have to extert playing the game is also a fairly good ground for buying it, just for health.  For these reasons, this game really is a worthwhile purchase even at $20.  If you can get a gooc sale, pick it up absolutely."

My computer is on the lower end of what's acceptable for VR (i5-2500k @ 4.4GHz and GTX 970) and I don't really have any performance issues.- It can be a good workout.  Playing a fast song on the hardest difficulty and going out of your way to 'punch' the orbs instead of just blocking them can work up a sweat.- I was incredibly impressed when I tried to load a song that hadn't been previously played.

They're nothing special to look at and you don't usually notice them anyway.- YouTube video playing in background is 100% unnecessary.

Before buying my vive, I greatly anticipated playing this title. It was one of my first purchases of vive software. My reference point is that of a musician. I'm a professional violinist, orchestra director and educator. Music is my life, and what I do for a living.I quickly have become disilutioned with this title, for one main reason. I feel that the ""punches and pulses"" should be curated for the best rhythm punching experience possible, but they are not. From what I have read and experienced by playing, the punching of beats is generated randomly.This makes for an often very bizzarre experience, that does not line up with the music very well.I wish the developers of Audioshield would add a method for the community to custom make punches (Like the Bethesda community), or have the developers create a library of curated songs, the game is just not worth spending time with.To recap:The pros:Great concept (if it worked)Awesome visual effectsCool left and right shields, feel great and look awesomeThe cons:-Most or all of the music is OUT OFSYNC with the beat puching-Punching is generated randomly-There is not currently a way for the community to create custom beat puches and movementsI would be one of the first people creating beats for the game, I'm sure the game would get much more popularity if the community could have a creative avenue with content generation for the game.Until these issues are addressed, I suggest to save your money and wait for the updates."

You have a blue shield in your left hand and an orange shield in your right. You choose a song to play to, which can be a suggested song or one from your music library (same as Audiosurf).As you play, projectiles are fired towards you; these are either blue, orange or purple in colour. As they reach you, you 'block' with the corresponding colour shield. Purple shots are blocked by holding both shields close or pulling both hand controller triggers (on HTC Vive).At the end of the song you're rated based on how many shots you blocked but also how artistic you were and how much energy you expend. Basically, play enthusiasticly, move around a lot and you'll get a better score provided you still manage to block shots well.The difficulty curve is well done; the lowest difficulty is extremely easy, but high BPM songs in higher difficulties can be a huge workout.Overall I think this is one of the 'killer' apps for Vive; just give whoever's playing a lot of space as you tend to lash out a lot!

Where the song slows down, so do the balls and vice versa when it picks up.   However, I expected it to be better with all of the positive reviews.   Second, it needs a better way to select music from the local drives.    The local music selection is done through a file picker when it really needs to be a music browser like winamp or itunes where you can browse by different criteria.    It takes a lot of time to go through a large music collection to find the song you want.   Luckily it keeps a shortcut of the last folder you were in but you have to start at the beginning of the file list if you want a new folder.

I would describe it as a Guitar-hero-esque rhythm game in a catch the missle style.The game has many many reasons to be bought:-With a price of 19.99 Euros, it is one of the cheaper VR-titles-It runs fine, even on mediocre Pc´s-While playing, the risk of smashing something is rather small, as you do not have to move around a whole lot ( if you aren´t going batshit crazy when playing the game)-The ability to use your own music is a godsent, but even without a huge music collection, you are provided every day with a playlist of popular songs to play-The representation of your songs is very often on point, far better than I could ever have imagined! The game is not perfect, as only the most prominent notes are being picked up, even if it isn´t the melody or the bass-line, which is to be expected.-Leaderboards provide a welcome challenge, and the possibility to be notified by mail, when you have been beaten in a song is a funny addition tooHowever, there are also a few ( nitpicky ) downsides which aren´t to be ignored:-For me, the sound output which I activated in the VR menu isn´t being respected, the sound then suddenly coming from my speakers when the game starts, even tho´ I put the output to the HDMI output. I solved the problem by mirroring the sound output to both my speakers and the HDMI.-The game is far too easy. Even when I pick the hardest difficulty, there have been no songs in which I had under 90% of correct notes- The music-selection menu gets a bit cluttered, the songs not being separated on pages but one ongoing cluster with all your songsFurthermore, I have to give the devs credit for fixing reoccuring problems very quickly.For me, the game is a must buy for any VR- or Music-enthusiast."

Very Tron-esque.I didn't have any problems with stability, kept a buttery smooth 90fps during gameplay. I did get some dropped frames when I started tweaking supersampling, but that isn't a fault of the game.It's a damn good workout.Neutral:In the grey area between a roomscale and standing experience. Not knocking the game at all here, works fine as is.Beats are generated based on an algorithm, the game scans the audio file and generates orbs accordingly. While ususally this works pretty well, there is some definite room for improvement. Understandably a lot of songs don't match up well on base difficulty. Faster paced songs having orbs matched to every beat could easily overwhelm new players on lower difficulty. That being said, some songs even on harder difficulty don't match up like you would hope. The option to play hand keyed music would be great.Cons:Huge lack of quality songs from the default online resource (Soundcloud). You will run into a lot of bad remixes of songs you actual want to play. If you have a well stocked Google Play Music account I would highly recommendthe Audioshield-PlayMusic mod.It's a proxy server mod that replaces Soundcloud support with Play Music support. This game would really flourish with support for Spotify, and Play Music out of the box.Song selection interface is poop.No way to see song length from menu. Would be very nice to know before you start an epic 10 minute+ song. This can be very exhausting on hard/harder difficulties.No Workshop support. Game only has 2 stages, and they get very old. Also handkeyed music would be a godsend, as mentioned in the neutral section.Searching for songs in-game is a chore, though this is more the fault of the steam virtual keyboard than the game itself. You're going to want to lauch the game and make a playlist at your computer, As opposed to searching for music a song at a time in-game.This seems to have gotten better with recent patches, but long songs can take a significant time to load.Rig: Intel Core i7-5930K, 32GB DDR4 2800, (x2) EVGA GTX 980 SC (One card dedicated to PhysX), 500GB Samsung 840 Evo SSD, Win 10."

,Recommended,412740,31184102,Posted: 16 April,all,Bow Ties,"Audioshield has overtaken our home.  For me and my roommates, this is the Vive killer app, and maybe it will be for you, too.Let's get the few minor cons out of the way, first:As others have noted, in some songs the orbs sometimes sync up poorly with the music, making such songs borderline unenjoyable (i.e., it seems more like a random pattern than any kind of rhythm).I have not experienced this, but some players report that very rarely, the game does not correctly detect an orb being blocked (my roommate, obsessed with getting perfect scores, can attest to how frustrating this can be).The menu interface still has some minor glitches, and certain functions are difficult to navigate to or occasionally decide not to work at all (this does not affect the gameplay at all, though, only the menus).If you go to play a song on YouTube that has never been played before, the game must analyze the entire video before it is ready for you to play (though if someone else did play it at least once already, you can just start right away, which is the case with most popular songs).Okay, now on to the good stuff:THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!  Find yourself some good songs where the orbs match up well (not that hard, I assure you; try some of the popular songs), crank up the difficulty, and jump in.  If you're a fan of rhythm games, you won't want to stop (seriously, as I write this I just finished a three-hour play session)!!Being able to connect to YouTube is a great feature.  Pretty much any song you could possibly think of is there for you to try, so you don't technically even need your own library, and it's easy to get lost in all the possibilities.The leaderboards! If you are even a little competitive, it can be a lot of fun challenging other people's scores.  And even if someone has a perfect score on a song, you can still ""dethrone"" them if you also get a perfect (though since it is possible to set up notifications when you get dethroned, don't think they won't try to take that top spot back).Like DDR before it, you will accidentally be getting a workout just by playing a video game... so this is definitely one game you don't have to feel guilty about getting addicted to.Like similar VR games (e.g. Space Pirate Trainer), this can be really fun to play locally with a group of friends taking turns (and guests can even put their own names in, to better keep track of scores).Lastly, the developer seems to be actively updating the game (adding new features, arenas, and so on), so as far as I can tell this game has a hopeful future ahead of it.And finally some neutral notes (whether these are pros or cons depends on your perspective):Each playthrough of a song will be slightly different.  While the exact timing and amount of orbs in a given song never change, the placement (and even orb color) can change from one playthrough to the next (though for those so inclined, there is supposedly a mod that changes this so every playthrough is identical).The game scores you on both your technical ability (i.e., blocking every single orb), as well as your artistic ability (i.e., how much you move around to the music), and the technical score takes precendence on the leaderboards.  This means, for example, that someone with a perfect technical score of 10.00 but a terrible artistic score of 5.00 would still beat someone with an excellent technical score of 9.99 and a perfect artistic score of 10.00. A little unintuitive, I think, and good to be aware of if you want to top the leaderboards.Finally, you need a compatible VR headseat with motion controllers (duh, but... just in case).In short, I highly recommend this game to anyone who owns a VR headset and is a fan of rhythm games or working out to music.  Recognize that you may find some duds, but the songs that work really well (and again, there are a lot of them) make it all worth it.Hope to see you on the leaderboards!! ☺"

First, There are games I get to have Fun.  Second, there are games I get to get a workout.  Audio Shield is both fun and a Workout.  This game also has infinite replayability and you find yourself coming back to it again and again, as long as you want to work out, and as long as you like to listen to your favorite tunes.  This is done by either selecting your own stored music on your computer, or the ever handy youtube search in the game.Now as for the criticism, in a user's opinion, about the game falling flat, because the Orbs don't fall more to a beat, thus ruining his rhythmic experience: Well, that is because they're not playing the game in such a way to give themselves the best rhythmic experience out there.  I myself, hit my Vive wands like drumsticks, hitting them on the beat while swaying my body, dancing to the song, and I am able to stay on the beat, hitting the wand to the beat when there aren't any orbs in the area, and when there are orbs, I hit them to the beat of the song.  And if you play the game like that, it is a great musical experience.  Like I said, this is a fun game I can come back and play to get my workout, over and over again, while being truly emerged into the rhythmic dancing experience.

The price tag is just right, though I would easily have paid more for this game. It's definitely simple in terms of mechanics, which makes it a great game to demo to first time users. It's a great party game. You can search Youtube for music right inside the game, or play your own music from the in-game menu. It's challenging, incredibly fun, and you feel like a badass when you block a purple orb with both sheilds. Some people say this game is too easy, but there are multiple difficulty settings that will definitely keep you busy and challenged for a while. I had a few friends over, and after playing a few different VR titles I've got, this is the one that we had the most fun with as a group. You can pair the in-game music to the TV/PC so that the whole group can listen to the music while someone plays, which makes for a great party atmosphere.I was a big fan of Audiosurf, and this game does not disappoint. The graphics are incredible, and it really showcases what VR can do with the smplest of design. The choice of shields is great, and so are the environments. I would love to see even more environments (currently just 3) in future updates. Maybe allow community modding to see what we can all come up with.I have a respectable VR library, and this is by far my favourite game. Do yourself a favour and try it.

It allows you to pick ANY youtube video and have it convert to notes and have you dance to it. It gives an incredible workout and makes you feel like a total boss climbing up the leaderboard. That said there are a couple complaints. The main being frequent crashes. Sometimes when I am in a game the thing starts to glitch. For some reason some songs are worse than others. I play this one song ([Sukone Tei] Psychotic Love Song) and while it is one of the most amazing songs for audioshield, it tends to crash halfway through. I am able to play for long periods of time but the game gives way to many crashes. A couple days the video searching function didn't work. My only other complaints are the lack of variety and it being easy. Sometimes I put some really intense songs.....only to have the notes go very slow. It ruins the groove and I can't play some songs I otherwise really enjoy. As for the lack of variety, there are only blue notes, red notes, and purple notes. Sometimes you hold them in one spot but that's about it. In a FEW (As in like 3) songs I found spots where the long notes curve and have this little twist. If there were more things like that then the songs would be more interesting.Interesting ideas:-Times where you have to completely freeze (Hopefully matching quiet parts of some intense songs like right before the beat drops)-Certain notes that you have to dodge (Whole body if possible)-Green notes (maybe another color) that make you have to move your hands in certain patterns-Community-made notes that will fit songs. Like, you could go with the actual formula or choose a pattern someone else madeI don't know. I feel like there are a lot more improvements that could be made to make the game more fun, harder, less repetative, and have the game stop crashing SO MUCH."

Just picked it up in the Steam Summer Sale and all I can say is WOW! Perhaps it's because I'm into clubbing muisic or that I'm a musician but this game is among the very best I've played on VR. I never expected the game to generate the entire melody as items to hit, but everything is in time and occasionally it will add in melody parts. However this could be the game's strength because you actually feel as though you are playing a different instrument part that is still in time. Playing on the harder setting gives a much greater degree of satisfaction and I look forward to being able to try Elite mode. The feeling of completing a purple shield block (both hands) followed by a long stream is amazing. VR games are all about how they make you feel and this hits the spot.I had some initial issues with crashing which were resolved by opting into Steam VR Beta as per the pinned support notice.If you like clubbing/dance/house/trance music then this is definitely for you. I suspect it wouldn't work so well with rock music, although SFV Ken's stage music works pretty well (yes I know it's not particularly rock)! The fact that you can play any song compared to other rhythm games that make you pay pounds for each song only adds to its value."

,Recommended,412740,33352714,Posted: 7 July,all,Xariann,"I tried Holodance, Soundboxing and Audioshield. I would say Audioshield is the game with the “most covenience factor.”You can just jump in, find a YouTube song and play. All the beatmaps are created by an algorithm, and if the song was never played by anyone before, Audioshield will scan it and create the beatmap for you.The game doesn't require third party programs to access music libraries and it doesn't require people to create beatmaps for you (or it doesn't require you to create one). Sounds good so far and it's the main reason I like Audioshield – there is little upkeep required.Since the beatmaps are created by an algorithm you can choose difficulty, so you can start slow and work your way up the difficulty levels, again a good thing about using an algorithm VS user made beatmaps. This also lets you avoid silly beatmap, where the person who created it does something very complicated that it is really not intuitive at all.While I seem to praise Audioshield's algorithm, I didn't really touch on the quality of its beatmaps which greatly varies from song to song. Audioshield seems to work best with classical music (for example try the Star Wars soundtrack), especially when there are no vocals. Volume seems to be the factor that influences beats the most.Audioshield will always throw you beats that correspond to something in the song, but what it does throw at you changes from attempt to attempt and it can be seemingly random. One time you will have to punch your way through the bass. The next it will be two beats from the base, one from a word it picked on, 1 from the drums, 1 from the guitar. This makes it seem like the beats are not on the rhythm. It is also very apparent that the algorithm can't fully distinguish the various instruments. Sadly, I don't think it's possible to code an algorithm that can do that perfectly, unless the instruments are saved on separate tracks. This is essentially what Holodance does for their story mode songs – they separate the instruments and then map them.Movement wise, Audioshield is my favourite. You use more of your virtual canvas than the other two games, certainly more than Soundboxing. You can make very large and sweeping movements, thing which you can do with Holodance, but Audioshield does it to a bigger degree. The bigger canvas however does present the issue of missing some beats because they were out of your field of view. It also presents issues at higher difficulties, where you have to touch to beats on the opposite sides of your “canvas” with the same hand in a VERY short time. I lost count of the amount of times I yelled, “I don't bend that way!”Although I do lean towards a particular music genre, my taste in music is fairly eclectic, so I find I can't stick to only playing Audioshield because some of the songs I want to play work better in Soundboxing. But when I am tired to play U2, Anastacia or ACDC in Soundboxing, and I want to play Singing In The Rain or the Star Wars Imperial March – Audioshield is definitely my go to."

Each motion control is a different color shield, as you frantically or ""artistically"" match them with the corresponding colored bubbles flying at you. The faster the song, the faster the bubble velocity. The harder the difficulty, the better it syncs up to the chosen song, although do not expect the algorithm to be perfect, it's very much like Audiosurf and does not sync well with every single song. Global, local and friendly leaderboards keep track of who's the best at the game for each song, assuming they're not constantly pausing the game. Either way, it is loads of fun within the HTC Vive and probably currently one of the best virtual reality games available on the market. Equipped with a few graphical options and a couple different environments, this extremely immersive, fun and a bit psychedelic game will give you a work out. That is, if you have more music in your library than slow, sad songs.The game is being patched up quite nicely and it is hands down, loads of fun.Buyer Beware:This game does not read Protected files. If your music library, usually consisting of content bought from iTunes back when DRM was an issue, has Protected file types, then Audioshield will not read them. Almost all other music file types are supported. However, this game now supports YouTube search & streaming."

The gameplay is an excellent way to get a bit of a workout, and if you can come up with a good list of songs to play with, you're going to have a great time.It isn't perfect, however. The user interface could use some work, as it's rather clunky in a number of areas, mostly related to   the rather important job of finding songs to play. It's clunky to navigate between different tracks, and the lack of a favorites list is the game's one almost unforgivable sin. Find a good song? Great! But if you want to find another song, be prepared to type it in or navigate your entire local music folder. There really needs to be a favorites list and a history, and I don't understand why the developers never put those in.That said, absolutely buy this game if you have a Vive.

However, what Audioshield offers is magical. I've found myself playing it every day in order to transform myself into the world of music that I'm normally only able to experience with my ears. With Audioshield, I'm thrown into the music and can feel it, and see it.Not only is Audioshield great exercise, but it's very recommendable to a wide audience. Out of all the games I currently own for HTC Vive, it's certainly one of the three best to demo to friends and family.It helps that I can use my own local music. That said, the Soundcloud based streaming provides some great options to diversify the offerings and make the experience less reliant on collecting a library of songs.Audioshield isn't perfect, though. The bubbles are inconsistent, resulting in some songs providing far less compelling experienes than others.. I will say that you will get the most out of this game if you enjoy electronic music. Although rock, progressive, pop, and other genres work within Audioshield, they tend not to provide as exciting and dynamic of rhythm for the gameplay.Additionally, the gameplay is limited to two stages and three types of shield. Therefore, as with other HTC Vive games, there's plenty of redundancy here, but it's still the most replayable room-scale experience that I've played.Out of the entire HTC Vive launch line-up, I would rate this as one of the three best options."

I purchased Audiosurf a few years ago, and liked the aspect of a music-based game using your own music instead of preinstalled or proprietary tracks. It was a cool idea, but not a game I could play for hours on a controller. When I heard the same company created the same idea, but on a VR platform. I couldn't contain my excitement. The game is beautifully put together, and it's incredibly easy to navigate the menus which can be done via your monitor and mouse or the HMD and controllers.Allowing the usage of Youtube videos is a new feature that was not available in Audiosurf, but for those of you with weaker systems it should be known the youtube video plays in the background along with the orbs coming at your face which can easily put a strain on your GPU. If you've got an extensive library of popular songs though, you'll have no issue finding some competition on their leaderboards which will be visible to you before you launch your song. Once you complete a song, you can see how you compare with others globally, within your region (aka state in the US) or your Steam friends that also play. You can also add your email address which will notify you if you are ever bested in a song by another, and your position in the leaderboard shifts down.Finally, there are a TON of people claiming the orbs do not sync in time with the song. That is crap. The orbs do sync in time with the song, but they won't always sync on the downbeat or on the part of a song which you would probably anticipate. The algorithm the game uses will often produce orbs on subdivisions of beats. If you are a musician or have any sense of rhythm outside 1-2-3-4, then you'll easily be able to feel the orbs syncing up with the tempo of the song. That being said, if you play something like Merzbow on Audioshield, the algorithm will most likely produce orbs that seem sporadic. The best music I've found to play on Audioshield are things like EDM, dubstep, trap, trance, even bass heavy pop songs. Post-hardcore & screamo music works well, too.As stated, this game is awesome, but everyone should know before purchase that this IS AN ACTIVE GAME. You will be moving your arms around A LOT! Especially as you progress into the higher difficulties. If you are into your music like I am,  you will probably even find yourself stepping or jumping in time with the music also. You can easily wear yourself out by getting lost in the music. Remember to wear your controller straps, take breaks after every 1-3 songs and be sure to keep your HMD dry of sweat."

76561197991957520,Recommended,412740,33691433,Posted: 21 July,all,Rorschach,"Audioshield is one of the best games I have played in a long time. I used to love DDR when I was a teenager, and this game is like a VR version for your arms, except it's even better because you aren't limited by song choice. You can play any audio with it, which I absolutely love!! This game has helped me actually enjoy exercising again for the first time in years. Because of that, it is also helping me with my depression and anxiety which is this incredible and unexpected benefit that I cannot thank you guys enough for.I have been obsessively playing this game almost every day since we got our VR headset at the beginning of this month (and felt ridiculously deprived for the week when we had no headset because we decided to return the VIVE and get the Rift instead.) I'm absolutely in love with this game. Because of that, I have a few suggestions that I really think would make it even better.First, I wish there was a way to adjust the height/width of the playing area and the shoulder level of the game. Sometimes, the red and blue spheres come flying from so high above me that my neck is craned way, way back to the point where it really hurts my neck and shoulders and they start to cramp up. If there were a way to manually set a limiter for that it would be such a relief. It doesn't even need to be adjusted that much; I enjoy that the height changes throughout the song, it just goes too far back for me and it becomes painful. I know I can take a step back behind the shoes on the ground as a sort of ""quick fix"" but it doesn't completely work because then the spheres are flying into the wrong area and then I find myself bending forward in an awkward position instead of it being the fluid dance that it usually is. If we could set our own parameters so that it fits our unique body that would be so nice. Same thing with the horizontal area from left to right. Because the edges of the headset don't allow for as much peripheral vision as we have in real life, I am constantly noticing a sphere here and there wayyyy off to the side that completely escaped my attention and I missed it because it was out of the range of my peripheral vision and I didn't even know it was there. It's not the end of the world, but it's definitely frustrating when you know that you wouldn't have missed it if you had actually been able to see it. I love how the game has a wide playing area, but for me I feel like it just needs to be slightly smaller to be comfortable. I wouldn't mind having the option for the spheres to go lower than they currently do, either.And as a way to make that whole idea even more user friendly, you could also allow us to set multiple profiles within the game so that if multiple people in the household play the game often, they don't have to constantly manually adjust these settings each time they switch. They can just select their profile (shoulder level, playing area size, etc.) and go. And I wish you could switch between steam accounts easily under one game setup. My fiance and I play most of our VR games through his account (this one) because it's just easier. But now all of my high scores are under his account so I don't get bragging rights. It's too much of a pain to switch between steam accounts all the time so I just don't worry about it. Still, though!Okay, and one more super cool idea. I'm sure everyone keeps telling you that you need more places to play (since there are only currently 3 locations to select from.) Well, what if, rather than having to make a whole bunch of new locations, you just made it compatible with Steam VR Environments?? Then anyone could choose from any environment they love, download directly to the game, and play there! That would really take Audioshield to a whole new level!!!Last but not least... I think that at some point there needs to be an even harder level than Elite. It is still wonderfully challenging, but some songs are so much better than others (pattern-wise) and there are songs I would love to play but even on elite they are just too slow between spheres. And some songs where there are really challenging parts (usually when the music picks up) but there are still long sections of the song where there are less spheres and it gets a little boring. And then there are songs that are really hard throughout the whole song and I LOVE that. Every time I find a song that is challenging the whole way through I'm like YESSSSS!!! The best part of this game is that it not only challenges your body to keep up, but it also challenges your brain. I'd rather do harder levels, even if I miss more, because my brain stays so focused and entertained in addition to the exercise I'm getting. That's the part that keeps me coming back for more!Thank you again for making this game -- it is absolutely fantastic!! I LOVE IT!Edit: Yes, please, please, please create a harder level than Elite. Roughly 75% of the songs on that level are too slow and boring already.There needs to be some feature that allows you to add more spheres to the song to make it more fun to play."

The gameplay is an excellent match for any input song, although I really enjoy playing electronic releases from Monstercat. Would definitely recommend playing on Elite difficulty, even as a beginner, as it really gets the adrenaline pumping! Unlike Guitar Hero et. al., it doesn't make stupid bumping noises whenever you miss a beat, so the gameplay is still enjoyable solely for the music, even on higher difficulty levels. Would also recommend playing in workout gear. After a few high-energy songs, you can end up pretty sweaty."

I'm an Audioshield addict.What really swung it was the moment I bothered to transfer my music collection over to the computer with the HTC Vive on it. Fending off incoming music blobs to your favourite tunes is so very more-ish.That said, I would like to point out that somewhere between the first and second times I played Audioshield, the leaderboards and global music menu stopped working. So when I tried it that first time I could pick from a selection of songs that other Audioshield users had ""battled"" their way through, when I came back I couldn't get to that menu and basically had to select songs from my computer's hard drive instead. Of course, since these aren't known to Audioshield, you can never compare your performance against anyone else. (So all the leaderboards stay completely blank.)If one of the devs reads this and can suggest what might have gone wrong and how I can get back the global menu / leaderboard, I'd really appreciate it. (Not that I think I'm any good at Audioshield, but it would be fun to see how my performances compare with others around the world...)All in all, this is the first game for the Vive that I could see myself playing on a daily basis to get some much needed exercise whilst revisiting my music collection... the latter having not received proper attention in many years due to the advent of podcasts! ;-)"
76561197988955334,Recommended,412740,28799789,"Posted: 29 December, 2016",all,Laozi,"So I've logged way too many hours with this game. In my opinion, it's worth a buy both as a fun diversion (who doesn't love punching music in the face?) and an actual fitness tool.First, the biggest complaint I see people making when they first try the game (and a claim often made in refunds) is that the rhythm at which the blue and orange balls come in doesn't match the song. That's actually true only if you try to ""catch"" the balls - which is not how you're supposed to play. You don't catch the notes in Audioshield - you punch them!Although it's not obvious, the beat track is generated such that it expects you to be punching the note with an extended arm from a standing position, not ""catching it"" a second later. That's why the beat track may seem off if you try to intercept the notes at your chest, rather than punching the note while it approaches. Once you figure *that* out, and you start to time your left/right punches with the beat, all of the sudden the game stops being a diversion and becomes an actual zenlike trance. Your punches match the beat and you start having a really good time.Obviously, as with other rhythm games, the difficulty level you choose will affect how many beats get thrown at you at once. If you start out on the lowest difficulty, this also lends to the feeling that the beat tracks aren't completely synced, as it purposely drops notes so as not to overwhelm you. Once you're ready to tackle Elite difficulty (which I believe is the most fun) you're getting tracks that match your chosen song beat for beat, and give you a good workout besides.As far as fitness goes, what makes Audioshield so good is that, once you start punching all the beats as they fly toward you, you start burning calories like nobody's business. Granted, a Fitbit is not a precise tool, but there's been times when I've burned 600 calories in maybe 50 minutes of play. Obviously, YMMV depending on whether you're punching fast or slow songs, and your difficulty level, but the biggest benefit of Audioshield is it keeps me entertained while I work out.I've tried exercise bikes, treadmills, and other devices for cardio while watching TV, and I get bored quickly. But I can easily punch music in Audioshield for an hour and the time flies by. Honestly, sometimes I have to make myself stop.As far as music, anything works, whether local files or right off Youtube. I have a ton of MP3s and prefer those, but I do stream songs off Youtube on occasion without issue. Finally, while Elite difficulty will make any song at least a bit challenging, there are certainly songs that are more fun than others (seriously, play just about anything by Blue Man Group and you'll have a good time). Anything with a strong beat is ideal, as the beat track comes off drums/percussion.In summary, I highly recommend this game for people who enjoy listening to music, rhythm games, punching music, or who just want a fun way to burn some calories while punching along to their favorite songs.Remember! Punch the notes, don't catch them."

It's one minigame sold for an high price. You're paying an HUGE VR premium. There are no hand made tracks, menus are as minimal as possible (looking for a specific track is hell, expecially on YouTube), there's a lack of costumization in the challenge and a lack of different ""hazards"" (boosting the difficulty just adds more spheres overall, there are no added challenges like spheres to avoid or to never touch);- Hard mode is cheap: most of the times I miss spheres just because they appear out of sight.- This is the most common complaint: the spheres basically NEVER follow the rhythm. The game rewards you for catching the spheres with strength, which is fine, but since they never seem to follow the song, most of the time you find yourself just parrying them because hitting them is pure luck.- To add to the last complaint, the spheres change speed on the fly which, together with the ""the song and the spheres are not on the same rhythm"" complaint, forces the player to passively parry the spheres, which kinda defeats the purpose of a music game.It's a fine game but for its features is worth way less than it's price (I bought it at 15€)."

The beats that you have to punch are not very consistent, meaning that even though you are hearing the same part in a song itself, it still plays diffrently. A lot of the time the beats do not sync in the slightest. Then, futher down a song you have to look at a very weird angle to block the beats. Why? Why can't i just look in front of me for the intirety of the song? It hurts my neck after a while.All these issues combined makes the €20 pricetag too hefty. I might get it again when it's sale, but right now it lacks a lot of polish."

At first I thought that it just wasn't running smoothly, but I testet it with different songs and there is definitely a connection.I expected the general speed of the song to determine the speed of the bubbles and the heigth of the notes influence the position of the bubbles which would feel a lot more intuitive, I think.All in all, I feel it's not actually worth 20 bucks.

The game has no music of its own, and instead generates note charts from your mp3s. Most of the time these charts end up being garbage, and you'd be better off just playing a game like Space Pirate Trainer with music in the background, but every now and then a song works really well and that's when this game shines. The problem is that the game is very buggy, and in the hour I played I ended up halfway through the floor twice, SteamVR crashed 3 times, my SteamVR desktop view was broken until I restarted SteamVR twice, and the game crashed every time I tried to close it, which I had to at one point when I chose the wrong song and the End Song button didn't respond to anything. Audioshield has potential, but right now it's so buggy that I'm considering refunding it and waiting to see if it gets patched. Until it does, it's hard to recommend it when it's already enough of a challenge finding songs that work well."

I tried out Feel Good Inc. by Gorillaz as my first song, and while it's fun to hear music you like while you play, I could tell that the beat balls weren't quite lined up right. I don't consider that the end of the world given the game can be modded some (from what I understand), but I'd hope for a little more polish on a game that isn't in early access.Overall, I like the premise of Audioshield, but it felt too prone to crashing and like it wasn't fully fleshed out as a game.

I rather enjoy the Hard and Elite difficulties, it's a great game to just put on as a warm up or even just to play for an hour or too. As with AS2, the game relies on your own tracks to generate a level for you which is pretty much the best thing about this game as you can find a track that's right for you and just mess with each of the difficulty settings.The game basically works by giving you a shield in each hand, left is blue, right is orange and you use them to hit the corresponding colours flying towards you, occasionally bringing the two colours together to make a shield to hit purple orbs.Honestly the game seems to function more like a work-out routine, a few songs on the higher difficulties and you're already sweating bullets, it's fantastic. Tracking of the headset and controllers is smooth as anything and I've had no major issues with the game aside from the occasional weird shake in the menus and you don't need a large play space either.I'd definitely recommend giving this game a go, especially if you've got a decent music library of fast/upbeat tracks (although there's an option to use YouTube too!)Overall, I'd give it an 8/10, a fun experience that could do with a few modes (maybe Workshop content like AS2) and maybe some harder difficulties without needing to mod the game to do so."

Im a big fan of DDR, Guitaro Hero, Stepmania, Cytus, Dance Central, Fantasia, and other such music games that bring my enjoyment of the songs to a new level. These kinds of games make the music feel more alive, it makes you feel part of it. So when I first heard of audioshield I knew right away I would be buying it, and It could potentially go beyond and be better than any music game ever.Sad to say, all of the games I mentioned are far better than audioshield. And what do they have that audioshield doesnt? On point beats/rythm. I am not a expert musician or game designer, but you dont have to be in order to realize that the red/blue/purple beats coming at your face is not at all lined up with the songs (at least the majority of the time).When you play other rythm games it makes you kinda dance or put your energy into the beats, it almost energizes you. A good song makes the game funner, and a good stage/level makes the song better. With audioshield though, it makes both feel worse. As I was playing the game I tried to make the color blasts match, I would try punching the blasts with my shield but that doesnt match, and many colors are long rifts which also doesnt match like it should. Then I try just blocking the blasts, which probably is the easiest way to go if you want to be accurate with the game, but this way is even less fun/engaging and it completely changes the game from a music beat type of game, to some bland, bargain bin, color matching game, the music just becomes backround noise if you play it this way.Long story short, I decided after about 10 different songs that this game sucks, its in a way broken, because it doesnt do what it sets out to do. It shouldnt be called audio shield, it should just be called Music Visualizer VR. And one other thing I must mention. If this game was 5 dollars I would still want my refund, because it is not fun or worth the money. But this game is 20 dollars?! WHY?!This is an example of a good idea that was POORLY executed. Hopefully another dev will take this idea and expand upon it in a way that is more accurate to the beat, and better bang for its buck, because this is nothing but a glorified music player visualizer."

However, of all of my Vive games (about 40), this one stays fun longer than all of them.  Being able to import your own MP3s really, really, helps with replayability.My only gripe is that the developer should continue to improve the synchronization of the incoming orbs with the music; there are times when it seems somewhat generic.  However, it is already pretty good.- 5 of 10 stars when compared to all other games, including AAA games not made for Vive/VR.- 9 of 10 stars when compared to all other Vive games (available today).- $9-$13 recommended value if the game does not improve much beyond its current state as of 7/10/2016."

The new updates have fundamentally changed the game to something I am no longer pleased with. Most importantly you have removed Sound Cloud support, which was one of the most compelling aspects of your game. Being able to search for new and unique songs was half the fun. Now we are stuck with a distracting and annoying YouTube video shoved into our faces, while we attempt play the game. The game for me was never about watching a video. It was about the music and the gameplay.  Also I am dissatisfied the trajectory of the orbs on the new epic setting. Maybe I could get used to that, but the orbs terminate at a far too low height for it to be enjoyable.The difficulty setting on epic is still not as difficult as I would like to see. Push the bounds and actually test people. That is why I will only play your game with a custom mod for an increased challenge. If its too slow it becomes boring and I lose interest quickly. People should not have to mod the game to be challenged. Your diehard fans want a game that is truly difficult. Not a game where grandma can come over and lazily punch at orbs. Sound Cloud should be reintroduced or at least an option to remove the awful YouTube video from the screen. That is why for now I will only play your game with my own music and a custom mod.

Through Osu integration nearby infinite gameplay. Highly recommended!Airtone: Best rhythm game out there, if you can life with Japanese pop. It has the best rhythm gameplay of all of them: you have to punch/slap the notes, just holding the stick in the direction is not enough; your punches/slaps make a sound when you hit so you hear the rhythm you are beating (not just a short vibration), the presentation is very beautiful, every song has three difficult levels, all in all very fun and addictive. 25 Tracks included.

Years of working with beat and rhythm detection have clearly worked wonders because the algorithm is perfect - although it will occasionally feel a little off timing, the orbs generally sync up wonderfully with the music and the pacing is almost perfect.I wouldn't recommend it for extended playing sessions though as it really gives you an upper body workout. Play a couple of songs, then do something to give yourself a break. Your arms, back and legs will thank you."

She doesn't play too much other VR games but whenever I have my computer setup in the front room she always jumps on Audioshield.. I usually am sore for a few days afterwards but that's cause I'm generally lazy when it comes to being active so there's a kinda/sorta/almost perk to playing this and other VR games.. It seems that it normally takes a few seconds for the orbs to sync up with the music but once it does we can easily get into the groove of things.. I have no issues with playing YouTube songs and since I have AdBlocker installed I don't see any ads or anything other people have been complaining about.. I would recommend not playing any live versions of songs as the audience clapping can cause random orbs causing chaos but when the music starts it's fine again until more clapping.. This is a must have for VR!!

Then after reading that many people were saying how much fun it actually is, I picked it up and goddamn is it a blast! Having spent a fair amount of time in Audiosurf, this feels like the next logical step with the introduction of VR.It's quite clichéd, but watching this game doesn't do it justice, you have to play it. It's challenging and matches the flow of the song pretty well, it's not perfect (ymmv, different genres track better than others), but does it ever get exciting when you see a huge wall of notes flying at you just as the song is about to get intense.I have noticed some issues where if I play a song that I have a local copy of that is listed on the popular tracks list, that the leaderboard doesn't have the same info on it. I don't honestly see a possible fix for this as it's probably because the songs are tagged differently from each other. This occurs in basically every game that you can play your own songs in, but I thought it was worth mentioning.One thing I think the game could use is custom beatmaps, similar to osu!. Currently all tracks are procedurally generated, and while it is very fun to play, you could do some very interesting things with a hand built beatmap."

Provide your own music and ramp up the difficulty to see how well this program can provide custom games on the fly. Intuitive controls feels sharp. VR is incredibly well utilized, as the notes approach you from a far distance. Successfully hitting a note also causes a waterballoon like explosion of color, which effects your vision. This last feature is great for VR, and makes you think not only about your movement but the angle - as the debris could block your view of future notes.Highly recommend for anyone starting in VR.

,Recommended,412740,22969055,"Posted: 13 May, 2016",all,TailTide,"TL;DR: Audioshield is hands down one of the most fun games I've ever played. I would buy a Vive for this game alone.This game absolutely nails the old principle of easy to learn, hard to master. The concept is simple: block the dots with your shields. I found it to be kind of fun and pretty easy on Normal difficulty. Once you increase it to Harder the game really shines. The dots match closer to the music and you have to move quickly. It's great exercise. Not the kind that will make you breathe heavy if you're in shape, the kind where your muscles are sore the day after playing for a few hours. Every genre of music is different so try out different things.It's not perfect. As I said, it's pretty easy on Normal and not as immersive because the dots don't match the beat well. Some genres of music are less fun. If all you like is slow, boring music this isn't for you. If music doesn't make you want to move this probably won't be very fun. If you're significantly out of shape and overweight you may find it challenging but it could be a great way to get some exercise.The game crashes. A LOT. Sometimes I get lucky when I launch it and it works. Most of the time it crashes a few times before it's stable. It crashes in multiple places, on launch, on song restart, and on song end. Disabling my second monitor seems to make the Vive more stable although I'm not sure if it helps Audioshield's stability. When it crashes on launch I find restarting the Vive helps."

What makes Audioshield stand out from the rest, however, is its brilliant execution of these simple mechanics in VR, turning it into an engaging and exciting bullet-hell like rhythm game.Balls coming in from almost every angle in front of you, and hitting them all requires you to move your hands and body in a way it feels like dancing. The workout you get in higher difficulties with high tempo musics can burn you out as quickly as doing aerobics classes.As Audioshield can read and analyse almost all types of common music files, it has virtually unlimited replayability, making it worth every penny paid for this game.This game quickly became my go to game for my daily VR needs, and also my daily exercise routine."

I pick a song and she goes in, she picks one and I go in. We get friendly rivalries going.Pros:- You can pick your own music. This is fantastic. in game, you can browse to a music folder and choose the song you want.- The game really does well with throwing the orbs based on the song.- Surprisingly good exercise.

The ability to play music on Soundcloud is a great implementation as you're then able to play songs that you don't own as well as the ability to play your own music. Another nice addition is leaderboards for your own music. if the metadata of the file that you're playing matches other files that were played with the same metadata, you get your own leaderboard for that song, which is a nice touch. The game itself is very enjoyable and probably has the most replay value of any other game I own. You feel very powerful smashing the notes with your shield. It really shows off the power of VR. You're even awarded points for hitting the notes harder, so you're made to work for the highscore. This game is simple, yet a lot of fun. I would absolutely reccomend it for the price but beware - it is VERY buggy at the moment. I usually have to restart the game 2 or 3 times when opening it because it'll just crash for no apparent reason. This seems to be a very widespread issue so hold off if that's going to bother you.

It needs a Quality of Life pass and a few extra features and reworking in some areas, but the game is so good as it is that it just doesn't even matter.When the music detection algorithm works (with a song that it likes), it REALLY works. Experiment with different songs/styles of music with different tempos. Any song that has an interesting rhythm or changes in tempo/musicality will force the game to rethink its ball pattern and keep you on your toes.AND PLAY IT ON HARD OR HARDER. Skip normal! I can't stress this enough. When I tried it the first time, I played a few songs on normal and it was boring. I didn't 'get it'.

I turned off VR, launched it normally, and it was up quickly.The major one was how much I had to crane my neck to play, probably because of the type of music I used. If you remember game demos at wal-mart that were on the top of the damn shelf, and you had to look all the way up, then YOU'RE A 90S KID and infinitely more importantly, you know what I'm talking about. If the devs would get on that, maybe tone down the maximum angle, then I can recommend it without hesitation.That aside, the game's awesome.

This is not a Rock Band type clone.  Your actions do not effect the music.  There's just a song that plays and you block these colored orbs that shoot out according to the tempo of the song.  The point is to block as many in a row as you can.  If you fail it doesn't actually do anything.  Something like this should either be free or no more than a couple bucks.

The Soundcloud aspect makes it a great way to discover new music.The gameplay doesn't have to be physically taxing, you can stand there and just move your arms to block the orbs but the game rewards physical activity and punch strength, which helps on leaderboards.I don't see myself growing tired of the gameplay anytime soon but if I did, the entertainment I have already received FAR exceeds the fairly modest price of $20.

,Recommended,412740,25596986,"Posted: 19 September, 2016",all,Drowrin,"This game lacks a lot of pollish.Typing in the menu is very finicky, just as one example. Enter something in wrong? have to fix a one letter typo? The game wipes the text every time you click the search bar, meaning you have to type it all back in again. This gets very frustrating for navigating to songs with a decent length title.This leads me to my next point, you can't favorite songs, or create any kind of playlists. If you like a particular song, and it isn't a popular song, you have to type it in every time. The other option is download the song, and keep it in one of the specific locations the game looks at. I keep all my music organized in very specific folders. To get there, I have to navigate from the drives through all the folders in between to finally get to music. It is also very easy to misclick in this menu, and then it is easy to misclick the ""go back to main"" and ""go back one folder"". Which means you will sometimes have to start over clicking through things to get to downloaded music. Overall frustrating experience if you want specific songs that aren't popular.The menus are inconsistent. The difficulty screen sorts by recently used. So you might see Hard, Easy, Medium or various other combinations. By default, these difficulties also show different texts for each difficulty in large text and in small text. HARDER-hard, HARD-normal, NORMAL-easy. This would be confusing by itself, but combined with the difficulties shuffling based on which you used last, it is puzzling (especially to people I try to show the game off to who haven't played it yet).Luckily (and this is a HUGE plus for the game imo), the difficulties are mod-able. After getting used to the hardest difficulty, I started tweaking the game files slowly. Eventually I downloaded pre-made mods online. This also helps with the confusion above. You can edit what the menu items say and differentiate them more. Using the Expert mod turned this into my favorite vive game by far.Despite the pollish issues, the gameplay is GREAT fun. especially with mods. I wouldloveit if the creator came back and gave this title some love, but either way it still manages to be one of the best vive games.Overall: recommended, though due to the various frustrations that will change if something comes out without them."

I was weary about beat detection after reading reviews and I think it's amazing at it. I tried out many different songs from my library. Rock, folk, some classical, a few glitch hop, punk, metal, and some light jazz. Worked pretty well on all of them. I'm not sure why people are having issues with the beat detection. My only guesses are is the audio mix isn't clear enough or maybe they are standing too close or too far. I even tried it on a recording of Owner of a Lonely Heart that was ripped from vinyl to cassette tape them ripped to mp3 and it was great to play.TLDR: Great experience. 9.5/10"

The concept is very well done and it's a good excuse to listen to your favourite music.My only gripe is, and I've seen this in other reviews, is the devs need to upgrade their protocol for generating orbs with the music. 80% of the time you feel like you're just hitting random orbs while your song plays. On the occasions where the orbs are actually in time with the music, it's epic and feels awesome. But the moments don't last long, and then you're back to hitting random orbs that aren't really in time with what you're hearing. If they update this to be even more accurate, this could be an easy 10/10 to sink hours and hours and hours into. I still recommend it, but I really hope this gets updated!"

I forced my girlfriend to try it, and almost had to force her to stop playing.

I have Youtube RED, so I'm not sure if their Youtube API is pulling my account info or not.+ Best note syncing I've ever seen in a game when using external music.+ Fun for every genre I tried: symphonic, metal, rock, rap, EDM and fast and slow variants.+ Youtube songs load instantly (unless it's a rare song, then takes the length of the song to scan)Bad- Why do we have to look so high up to play this game? My neck gets sore after a while and there is no setting to change this.- I'm on a GTX 1070 and 3.12 Ghz quad core, but the game sort of fades out to the ""waiting for X game"" screen maybe once every 1-3 minutes for 1-2 seconds REGARDLESS of if I have the graphics turned to the absolute max or lowest.- This is kind of a nitpick, but the hard difficulty makes you look left and right constantly, rather than just worrying about more complex note patterns. Seems cheap.WishlistThis game has big potential, but I want the world to be even more engaging, like maybe seeing distant mountains as waveforms pulsing in matching colors.How about a song editor?Harder difficulties should introduce more colors or maybe instruments. like clicking the button pad to change it the green.

While Technical score and Physical activity are pretty self-explanatory, I have trouble figuring out how to increase max punch power score. I obviously tried to punch notes harder, with little impact on it.2. Harder difficulties. After playing for just 2 days for like 1-2 hours I was able to get a 10 on some of the songs I like. Of course there might be slightly harder songs waiting and I can work on Artistic score, but I think a perfect 10 should be hard to achieve.3.

There are only two different levels, but that doesn't really matter too much. The bigger problem is when some songs just don't work well. The orbs are sometimes skip beats, and sometimes tracks different instruments/sounds at the same time, which makes it a bit confusing. BUT, when you find a song that works well with the game, it works REALLY well.If you have a Google Play Music subscription, I highly recommend you usethis proxy server workaroundwhich lets you use ANY song from Play Music instead of Soundcloud.This is honestly a must-try for anyone with an HTC Vive."

Being able to have an extended play session would be good, and add to the challenge (I've already lost a few pounds playing this game... an extended ""non-stop"" option would up the real world workout you get playing this!)Just buy it..."

Rereading that sentence, I don't know if I've made it sound pedestrian or exciting, but I assure you it's the latter.If you own a Vive, this is pretty much a must-own. The menu UI is a little rough-around-the-edges, but the game inside it is so good (and pretty, for that matter) that you won't really care about that.PROTIP: Don't use your library of soothing smooth jazz for this game. :P Bust out something uptempo with a lot of energy behind it instead-- dubstep, heavy metal, hard rock, house, hiphop, eurodance, etc. are all good choices.

,Not Recommended,412740,32177562,Posted: 4 June,all,dances with woolite,"This game kept showing up among popular VR games so I decided to try it out. I was disappointed.Pros:- Totally smooth on geforce 1080. Looks good; generous particle effects.- When everything syncs up, VR beat dance is a great idea, and fun.- Pretty cool that it can import youtube videos, though it takes a while and seems to be only some subset of youtube.Cons:- The automatic beat inference is bad. I tried a bunch of different music, including just some random tunes I like, electronic music that I thought would be ""easy for it"", and the globally most popular tracks (which I figured must be good?). There were certainly moments where I felt the sequence matched the song well, but they didn't last long. Like sometimes you'd get to a point in the song that was obviously symmetric to something you just did, but the dot sequence would just be different.- Menus and things seem pretty unpolished. ""Change location"" button just didn't do anything. Post-game report is like an ascii-formatted text file that shows up in a text box. There is no introduction for first-time players; it just throws you into the song browser.- Seems like they could easily provide more environments, but there are only three, so I got bored of those pretty fast.- It's hard to get perfect scores, but I didn't find the game all that challenging even at the highest level; there's not much negative feedback if you miss hitting dots and you can't ""fail"" a song like in Guitar Hero. I would like to see it directly challenge me some more. It also could use the up/down dimension more on difficult sequences. It's mostly punching backand forth at chest level.If this had a much better sequence inference, or a library of hand-tuned sequences for good music, I could definitely see getting into it."

It will remember the song so it's a one time only thing. I was impressed when I finally tried Duke Ellington and Django Reinhardt. Even jazz is a pleasure to play.

I really appreciate that everything can be searched and selected with just the vive controls themselves (no taking off the headset and going back over to the computer to select a song or anything like that).  My favorite feature would probably be that you can search up any song you want on youtube through the game and it will load it up as a new track for you.  I would recommend this to pretty much anyone with a vive.

I love how it gets you moving about your room trying to hit all the beats and after a couple songs I'm actually breathing pretty good with a good sweat going!  It's a lot of fun with moderate re-play value and makes for a staple party game.Now for the bad....  The games audio sync is really not that great.  Half the time I feel like the game has just synced to random noises in the song and are not to the beat at all.  The moves feel un-natural, not to the time of the music.  Because of it, it is very difficult to keep up with the moves because they don't match the natural time of the music.  It feels this way for most songs, I've only found a handful that are perfectly timed, poppy and fun.It's very interruptive as well having to wait to start or wait to end, pick a new song takes time and a lot of songs the timing is lagged.  It looks like the song synced well but the beats stutter...  Freeze up and then suddenly come flying at you.  Nothing is ever at a consistent speed and it's hard to keep on top of, again, detracting from the experience.I like it, but I think they have some work to do on the game, and the price."

Finishing a track to find I have only one miss is like a red rag to a bull and I have to retry until I get a perfect technical 10 :)But technical score is only part of your overall score. The Artistic Expression score is used in case of a Technical score tie to determine which attempt is best. Artistic Expression scores are improved by moving about more. Not just your hands, but your head as well. So to get a high AE score, you need to move around more which gives you a better workout as well.After 12 or more hours of play, I still want more.

It's simplistic in a good way; Audiosurf tended to overcomplicate the game with all sorts of gamemodes when almost everyone played the game in mono mode. The core gameplay is simplistic in the way mono mode in Audiosurf is. But it is also challenging, moreso than Audiosurf. It has that same arcade high score focus but the basic gameplay is overall more fun because it encourages you to move to the music. It's designed from the ground up for VR and it shows.It's a comfortable game for VR and I can't imagine anyone getting sick from this. It can also be played in a very small space as you stay in a single position.It's not a perfect game and I feel like it needs some polish, specifically in the menus which feel unfinished and clunky to navigate. The curation of tracks could also use work. Personally I don't have any audio tracks on local storage as I stream everything from Spotify and have done so for some time, and I suspect many people are the same. There is Youtube integration but for it to really elevate the game there should be some better curation on offer. It could be as simple as pulling data from the trending and most popular tracks on Youtube. That would keep it fresh, offer 'new' content weekly with little further input from the developer once implemented and prevent the 'most popular' Audioshield list from ending up stagnant as it currently stands. Also the beat detection isn't perfect, and you'll quickly find that like in Audiosurf, some songs are just better to play than others, with the best generally being those with a prominent beat.I recommend this game as it is fun and is unique in its ability to make levels out of any music.

Songs with hard hitting notes that are defined, with percussion that is clear works the best. Music that has a lot of background noise (i.e. Classic Rock) doesn't work as well, and the notes will seem more random. The algorythm could be better in that sense. However, when the system works, with the whole song having the orbs on point, it is very, very fun.Cons:-Soundcloud support removed (Although this isnt really the devs fault, as Soundcloud themselves no longer supported the feature that was required for it to work)Overall I find the game very enjoyable, and I can forgive that the orbs aren't always 100% accurate to the notes, but it is good enough for me.

,Recommended,412740,33765841,Posted: 24 July,all,Brian David Phillips,"I really really really like this game.  I currently play almost every morning as part of my VR exercise routine.  I wish there were playlist options as that would be sooo much easier.  I now use a single MP3 in the mornings that I have edited together several songs so I can get a solid amount of time in play without having to stop and load a new song each time.  I also wish there were record keeping tools that would export my progress and scores into a text database I could access outside of VR.  Speaking of record keeping, it would be nice to have a scale or the like that tells us what the various scores mean (hit accuracy % is intuitive but knowing how high the numbers go on max punch power or style or the rest would be very helpful for folks - speaking of max punch power, avg punch power would also be helpful).I absolutely reccommend this game.  It's a really solid and fun experience worth coming back to oveer and over again.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp3cyPtmXbw"

Simply said it's audiosurf in VR. So if you enjoy these kind of games then yes, this is for you. For me (as a heavier person) this is also a good workout but for fit people this is nothing i imagin.Other than that it's just a very simple game, not alot of feauters and maybe a bit too pricy. So i say grab it if you like this kind of rythm game or if it's on sale."

,Recommended,412740,33277278,Posted: 5 July,all,TheFloppyFish,I just did my first two songs and I was blown away completely. I have never experienced my music like this before. For $10 on the sale I really got a steal. It is like having sex without the sex. I am absolutely going to reccomend this to everyone I know who has a vr headset.Future Edit: Still loving this game and doing hardcore mode perioduically. I only do two or three songs a time though or my headset is soaked in sweat.

,Recommended,412740,34248817,Posted: 14 August,all,Rob,I love pop music and this game/experience gives me an excuse to play songs I love and also get a little exercise.  It is a simple concept well executed and I like it far more than I expected.  Just great.
76561198043893394,Recommended,412740,34137298,Posted: 9 August,all,Doctor K,"If you like blocking, or for more of a workout, punching blue and orange orbs going to the beat of your favorite music, then you'll love this game.I can't get enough of it. There is so much positive gain from this game. If you punch like a boxer would, the workout you get is amazing! My endurance has increased so much it's noticeable even when I bike, when I'm at work, when I'm getting some, and when I play longer songs.Though, I wish there was a beat counter so I could see how many orbs I've missed. I also wish there was an elite plus or elite was harder for difficulty.Otherwise, it's my favorite VR game and couldn't recommend it more. Only game I've ever written a review for twice"
,Recommended,412740,34626175,Posted: 30 August,all,Eddev,"One of the best VR experiences out there! If you like music this is for you! (Cudos to those of you who play Osu!). The game is simple, and fun, it also keeps you moving at the same time! I can't tell you how many times I've taken off my headset sweating, ready to lay down."
,Not Recommended,412740,32282510,Posted: 8 June,all,Thescott,"They seemed to fixed the constant crashing issue, so hooray for that, but now the music seems even more out of sync with the gameplay. It was already a bit hit and miss, but now songs that were fun to play before and worked well don't work at all. When you can get a song that matches up with the actual beat of the music, this game is magical and all sorts of fun, but that's kind of rare. More often than not, it just feels like orbs randomly flying at you while music plays."

,Recommended,412740,34553584,Posted: 28 August,all,dabawes,"I look at the reviews and see a lot of positive ones with mild complaints about simplicity or not worth the price or lack of content.  I wanted a rhythm game that could bring me back to my DDR days because lord knows I need the exercise but I don't want to leave the home.  Honestly, I was really skeptical about picking this one up after seeing such reviews but the youtube feature was enough for me to pull the trigger.I will say I haven't tried much of the normal difficulty.  Just the harder and elite ones with a handful of kpop songs because that's what I listen to.  There's definitely some sync issues but they are incredibly mild to me and coming from a DDR/PIU/Bemani rhythm game background, it's quite forgiveable.  I feel like I'm getting exactly what I was looking for and the price tag is well worth it in my eyes."
,Recommended,412740,35073076,Posted: 19 September,all,Kalado,"One of my favorite games already. If you like rythm games of any kind and have a HMD, this is a no-brainer.One big negative that should be added is mods/workshop support and ideally an easy editor to contribute human mapped songs."
,Recommended,412740,35081603,Posted: 20 September,all,jybrd,"By far the best VR game Ive played so far. What a work out too. If you are like me and dont really do much along the lines of working out this could be a great way to get a little into your life. You wont realize you are working out because the game is so much fun. Grab your favorite songs off your computer or youtube and away you go. What a blast. Smooth and crisp graphics. Recommend to anyone with VR. I did not buy on sale, and feel the price is spot on. Great value."

Has some included tracks but you can point it to your iTunes Library or You Tube and play any song you want. The graphics suit the gameplay brilliantly with great particle effects. Turn up the difficulty and you can get a cardio workout too! Would like to see a few more Arenas as there are currently only three choices.
