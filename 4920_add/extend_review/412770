,Recommended,412770,24055607,"Posted: 3 July, 2016",all,CorvusCorax,"For starters, let me clarify something: this game has nothing to do with that atrocious slasher film titled Boogeyman. Neither does it have anything to do with its sequels. Boogeyman is about the very mythical creature that parents use to make their children go bed in time or simply behave properly. I think the adaptation of such a thing is a very clever idea.Many people compared this to the series called Five Nights At Freddy's. The concept is similar: we are positioned at a specific place - we cannot move just look around in Thomas' room. Mentioned boy is equipped with a flashlight, the sole weapon that is capable of ridding ourselves of the boogeyman. The mission is very simple: survive till 6 o'clock in the morning. We have to survive 6 hours on our bed while the creature can enter our room through the window, the vent, come out of the cupboard or from under the bed and can even use the door from the corridor to peek in.The game uses a handful of distractions. While we can manage ourselves pretty soon we realise it's not just about the surveillance but also about paying attention to various noises the boogeyman makes. Did he just make a scratching sound? He's coming from under our bed. Do you hear him breathing? He will not come out but you are not to take a look at underneath you.And this is what I like about the game: it forces you to look under the bed. The very place with batteries to charge your flashlight. It is the challenging part as you definitely get some important seconds lost while going down there which is a must. Early on you find the game easy but come Night 4 and you are in for a world of hurt! Overall, 7 nights are to be completed and I have to say I enjoyed the ride.Back to distractions: the game employs some weather effects to play with your senses. While the lightning can help you see the room for a sec or two the constant sound of the heavy rain may suppress the boogie's noises. There are a couple of lights turned on but sooner or later all are switched off and we barely have any lighting sources. I like how the toys can be turned on out of the blue making us drive up the wall. The cymbal-banging monkey toy in the corner just behind us looks as if he just arrived from a Stephen King novel.The game has an additional, free-roaming, house exploration mode but that I did not like. I did not find it as terrifying as the original concept. Moreover I cannot comment on the VR option. A propos VR: the floating menus are certainly an improvement compared to the ones in the older versions but it does not pause the game itself - it is pretty annoying to start over because I had the idea of changing something in the video settings.Some more gameplay modes and added difficulty levels would be great additions. Also, the death animation is pretty annoying as in case a 2nd or 3rd boogeyman enters the room while the animation is being played it is followed up by theirs. This repetition of monster pop-up and an ugly red screen could certainly use some improvement.Boogeyman is a refreshing concept in a genre that has seen some great games in recent years such as Slenderman or Outlast. It can certainly stand on its own but I recommend the developer make some improvements here and there to fully utilise this great idea."

It has FNAF like influences but don't mistake this for another crappy fnaf clone because this is far from it. With little to no bugs, amazing atmoshpere, good quality jumpscares, great enemy boogeyman model and much more, I can easily put this in my top 10 favorite horror games thus far!I played this on my YouTube and completed every night including Halloween night, which let's just say is very difficult lol.My end verdict, if you are a horror fan this is a must buy!Video Link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e4bM7bCWFg"

,Recommended,412770,22758052,"Posted: 2 May, 2016",all,Akira Otoishi,"Pros:+ Pleasant to look at graphics+ Decent animation+ Awesome Monster Designs and Concepts+ Tense and well built atmosphere+ Well placed scares+ Constantly improving, consistant addition of new things+ Management HorrorCons:- A couple of minor glitches ( will explain below )- Issue with the menu screen- No mouse sensitivity options ( My mouse will fly around )- A bit too easy but suddenly 0 to 100 on Night 5 and beyond.PROS:  Boogeyman is an $7.99 game which I picked up for only $3.99 and has been an overall enjoyable experiance and worth the $3.99 that I paid for it. Following on the tails of the new popular genre of management horror, as made popular by Five Nights at Freddy's, Boogeyman is a fresh take on this genre and does not clone other popular management horror games- even if it comes with the Fazbear brand cassete tapes to start the nights off.  A lot of love and care has gone into the details of this game, making Thomas's room very detailed and putting a lot of time and effort into the animations of the various monsters and items in the room. Boogeyman also has very, very good sound engineering that makes audio the main focus of surviving the night. Not only in the survival portions of the night but the collection portions as well. The atmosphere is also very well built with the lore and consistant with its tense build up of threat instead of throwing jumpscares at you like most horror games found on Steam. It is an overall challenging and fun experiance!CONS ( but mostly recommendations to the developer ): Something that I noticed is that Boogeyman has heavy VR support and I did not play it with a VR set up, which would definately intensify the survival parts of the night- but the developer shouldn't forget to include the players who are not using VR and to make sure to have full control support ( i.e. mouse sensitivity settings ). There were a few glitches when I was playing that resulted in having to suicide under a vent or restarting the program- this being that when I opened the menu while in the survival portion of the night that no keys would let me close the menu therefore resulting me in having to close the program. The second glitch which I encountered was the shelf in the bathroom would become inaccessible since I could not fit between the bath tub and the toilet- meaning that when the flashlight was in that location that I would not longer be able to access the rest of the game unless I suicide or re-start the program. Lastly, when it comes to issues, I felt that the difficulty level majorly increased- I went from being able to complete to night barely looking at the screen to being completely unable to make it one hour into the night ( which may be my own fault ) but with the trailor, I cannot imagine getting far past where I currently stopped.But despite this, I would recommend this game for the $7.99 that the developers are charging for it. You will definately get a few hours of fun and challenge, especially those that you are into games like FNAF."
76561198002521511,Recommended,412770,19202867,"Posted: 21 November, 2015",all,xForbiddenOne,"Well, I purposely held off on reviewing this game until I felt I had proper time played as well as knowledge of the developer, So let us get into this review.First, I will say this IS a game that seems to be heavily inspired by Five Nights at Freddy's, But I really wouldn't consider it a complete copy, It's definitely different, And it's a bit more than just senseless jump scares. I don't personally find this game very scary personally, But I still enjoy playing this one quite a bit. In this game, You're armed with only a flashlight, As the boogeyman tries to come at you from four different directions, However there's a few catches. The boogeyman is loud, And each place he tries to come from has a distinct sound, Making audio a key factor. When you hear him, You simply have to shine your flashlight on him and he goes away. It's apparent he doesn't enjoy the light very much, So when the sun comes up at 6:00 AM, He's done for the night. A very basic concept, And it's faily well exectured.Everything seems to have a good amount of detail to it,  The lighting seems perfect, There's various distractions such as weather changes, An owl, A plane going across the floor, A ball rolling off the shelf, Your nightlight will randomly go out, The hallway lights will also go out, And the television will occasionally turn on with quite a bit of white noise to it. I personally feel all of these little things add some extra tension that just wouldn't be there normally.If you happen to run out of battery (You really shouldn't in most cases.) You can still save yourself as there's batteries under the bed with I believe a 50% chance of getting a battery, 25% chance of nothing, And 25% chance of the boogeyman trying to eat your head off. The batteries you do get vary in how long they last, Having red, green, And blue batteries. Blue being the best with a realtively low chance.The one thing I'm neutral about is more preference than anything else, The boogeyman has a seemingly goofy appearance, And while it fits the game's art style pretty well, I don't personally find it to be that frightening.Now, We'll mention some things about the developer. He/She seems very passionate and appears to care greatly about the game, As a result of this he fixed complaints, Bugs, And adds suggestions in a relatively fast manner. This is always a great thing. He's been very active about responding to posts, Whether it's for technical help, Suggestions, Bugs or criticism he seems to be taking it well. It's always comforting to see developers actually work on their game in the indie field, As recently we've seen a lot of broken games or buggy games that just suck with no attention given to them. This is NOT one of those games. I have nothing but good things to say based on what I've seen in this department.-Pros• Great atmopshere• Good art direction• Plenty of things to distract you while playing, Making it sometimes easy to not notice the oogy boogeyman• Changing weather, With rain and wind.• Good gameplay for the type of game it is• An acceptable amount of game options, But note that it lacks sound options• Incredible developer who seems very passionate about the game, And has released a patch almost everyday since I've acquired the game (Not everyday, But close enough), Sometimes doing two patches a day.-Cons• A somewhat goofy creature trying to get you, Despite fitting the game's art very well, He doesn't seem too menancing.• There's no sound options at all (It's apparently harder then expected, And it does sound like He's looked into it, But I still have to list this as a con. It doesn't bother me personally, But it may bother you.)• For some, The price may be an issue.At the current time, This is currently all I have to say so far. I plan to update this review if I experience other issues, Or have more things to add. Thanks for taking the time to read if you did, And hopefully this review helped you in some way."
,Recommended,412770,32075341,Posted: 30 May,all,Coron Canelis,"If you get this game play the older version. The boogeyman looked creepier, the intro and whispering are awesome. The distractions/red-herring-scares were much more effective.In the recent version, the intro was removed, the monster's new texture is much less scary, the menu is glitchy and doesn't always pause, and the load times are ridiculous. The only good thing about the update is the house exploration; it's rules are consistent but kind of difficult to figure out. It's somewhat creepy but frustrating more than anything. The worst part is that even when you complete it, if you die during the actual night, you have to restart the house exploration. This can be circumvented by turning it off at the main menu, but adding to the iteration time like it does is still very poor game design. I haven't even gone over everything, but trust me when I say that you want to play the older version.Just go into the game's properties, then the betas menu and select boogeyman 1.0. Also, remember to turn the sensitivity way down from the default or it's difficult to play."

If you're looking for something to play after you play all of the five nights at freddys games, this is it. In the case of this game, The boogeyman is trying to get you by going through your vent, your closet, your door, your window, and sometimes under your bed. The first time he gets to one of those places, he doesn't attack you. Instead, he rigs the entrance way to your room so all he has to is jump on you if he comes that way again.

I was never into FNAF because of the enemies being silly animals, however I loved the idea of the games. But Boogeyman... Boogeyman is perfect. This game is like a twisted horror game fantasy come true. xD . I love how scared I am of this game. At some points when im low on battery for my flashlight, I hit pause and quit. Do not play if you have a heart condition, and I will absolutely only play with headphones because of how quiet the boogeyman becomes in later levels. Suprisingly, this game actually has a story too, through audio logs. 10/10 for sure, no glitches or anything at all wrong with this game. Also, a small feature that I like is how he doesnt come from the same spot every single time on the levels. I would reccomend this to someone who likes horror games, if not then this game isn't for you."
76561198048974498,Recommended,412770,19709778,"Posted: 15 December, 2015",all,rjmacready,"Firstly, a disclaimer:  No, no, and finally NO, I have not yet played Five Nights at Freddy's 4.  But I'm well aware that there may be certain strong similarities between that particular game and this one.  I have, in any case, played the first three FNAF games, and can thereby make comparisons to those.I'm relieved to report that this is probably the best FNAF ""homage"" that I've played thus far.  Have I played them all?  Again...NO.  I play a lot of horror games, and not all of them have to resemble an ever-so-mildly ""ground-breaking"" title from as far back in the annals of human history as the year 2014.  But I have played a few Freddy ""rip-offs"", and this is probably the best.  Well, okay...the best which features a first-person perspective.  Go To Bed: Survive The Night is probably on a par with this.  But it doesn't look like this.  But it is set in a bedroom, where you have to keep beasties at bay, sometimes using light and...Oh Lord, do you see how difficult this is getting?  This is because I know what a bunch of tribal ferals the FNAF fans are.  Self-righteous little turds who think that because something got released while they were just growing their first pubic hairs, it's the most revolutionary thing to come down the turnpike since SLICED ♥♥♥♥ING BREAD.  Every generation does it, I'm sure.  I'm sure MY generation did it.  Hell, a fair proportion of MY generation thought that we invented rock 'n' roll (it was actually called ""grunge"", and contrary to some reports, WASN'T actually the first time in recorded human history that someone had plugged in a guitar and screamed over the top of it).Anyway, can I get on with my review now?  Now that I've acknowledged that, yes, I'm aware of a series that this game takes some, ahem, ""inspiration"" from?!  A series which is barely over a year old as I type these words?!?  Good.  Thank you.Boogeyman is actually rather good.  Not revolutionary, but good.  Not the most original game in all of gaming history, but really, really solid.  And as an added bonus, and unlike some other super-recent FNAF ""clones"" (Emily Wants to Play?  Emily Wants to Suck My Big, Fat♥♥♥♥♥♥ more likely!), it lays down its rules simply and clearly and just ups the stakes from there.  In other words, it's clever enough, without being TOO ""clever"" for its own boots.  Sure, it messes with you, but it's mostly quite fair and doesn't wallow TOO much in ""cheap deaths"" the way that many FNAF wannabes - and the FNAF games themselves, for that matter - do.  And I suspect it would be better still with one of them Oculus Rift thingies.Definitely recommended, not ONLY to Freddy fans, but to horror fans in general.  No great shakes - maybe a few decent scares, at best - but a very solid premise with very solid gameplay and a few minor tricks up its sleeves.  Nice.Verdict: 8.5/10.(PS All you ""Freddy"" fanatics DO know that there was a very famous horror ""Freddy"" long before the Fazbear?  Just a minor example of how you little tiddlywinks DIDN'T invent any ♥♥♥♥ing wheels.  Google it if you gotta.)"

However, speaking for myself--and I do love the FNAF games--this game has the potential to be more frightening to me. Why? I'm not even slightly afraid of animatronics and as a child, I was horrified of the dark and being alone. Yes, it does get simple and predictable, but that is being worked on. The main change I would like to see is the closet attack: seeing the boogeyman come out is honestly way more goofy than scary. His long, sharp claws and appendages are horrifying, but his body is honestly kind of hilarious. I would make it so that the closet opens and you don't see the Boogeyman, you see a long shadow start creeping out--this would make even more sense with the flashlight mechanic.Overall, I enjoy this game and want to see it grow to be the next great horror game. It's worth trying and testing, but probably not worth sinking your life into."

Don't let this make you believe this is unplayable, because if you're lucky you can find extra batteries under your bed, providing your friendly neighborhood Boogeyman hasn't set up base camp under there first.The graphics are good with great use of HDR (High Dynamic Range) light rendering meaning your characters eyes have to adjust to the varying levels of darkness to see properly.  But good graphcis do not a good game make for horror games.  Immersion is in the sounds and this game nails it.  Did you just hear the Boogeyman open the vent?  He could have, but he might have just left it open to attack from it later in silence.Even if the developer considers this game unfinished (pre version 2.0) this is still very much worth your time and money.  Even if you blast through the first few nights, the later levels will leave you feeling with dread and anticipation.So stop reading my review, buy the game and play it yourselve.

Since then, it has become so much more. And the game is much better for it.I love that before surviving the night you get to explore the house and look for different tools to help you. (You have to find your flashlight too, and since its the monsters' only weakness it's pretty much essential.) In these segments you get a feel for young protagonist Thomas's home life. His family seems disjointed and disconnected, as Thomas never wants to go to him for help.The voice acting on the tapes, along with the story itself are grand. You learn the tale of two little girls in their fight against the boogeyman. Then towards the end of the game the story gets turned on its head and you learn that it might not be as simple as you originally thought.The game isn't difficult, but it's worth experiencing. And five hours for one playthrough (stuck on the last level for a couple of them) is pretty good for the price.

76561198076346059,Recommended,412770,19575006,"Posted: 8 December, 2015",all,E.C. Mann,"Boogeyman, developed by Barry McCabe, is a game clearly inspired by Five Night’s at Freddy’s. However, unlike most FNAF clones, Boogeyman brings some new features to this beloved concept which highly enhances the experience. To be blunt, I think Boogeyman is scarier than Five Nights by a major degree.You play as Thomas, an eight year old boy who’s recently moved to the suburbs with his family. October is coming to a close, and Halloween looms just around the corner. But the world’s scariest night isn’t the only thing approaching. After settling into his new room, Thomas finds an old tape hidden within an older radio set. The recording is that of a young girl, Aryanna, who once lived in the house with her older sister, Ellie. She warns the listener of a horrible monster described as “The Boogeyman.” It had haunted them for many nights, ripping the sanity from their lives. Thomas has unwillingly taken their position, and must struggle to survive until Halloween’s end.I’ll start with graphics, and for a game as simple as this, they aren’t half-bad. Shadows reach beyond brightly lit walls and cast thick, dark trails across the carpet. Light shines and reflects off of surfaces in a godly manner, and I believe the dev put some serious effort into these effects.Gameplay, as you’d expect, borrows heavily from FNAF. You’ll be confined to the foot of your bed, looking about the room for the Boogeyman. There are no cameras to monitor, no doors to open and close, and no lights to flicker. Stripping these features away makes the game more intense. All your attention and effort is devoted to keeping the monster out, and there’s nothing to distract you from that.The Boogeyman has four separate access routes into the room: Closet, door, window and air vent. Each time the Boogeyman attempts to enter through any of these points, a sound affect will trigger. This is where sound comes in, and let me tell you, sound is this game’s BIGGEST mechanic. Shinning your flashlight on the Boogeyman is your only manner of defense, and in doing so, he’ll flee. However, if you fail to stop him from opening an access point, he’ll be able to enter without making a sound. So it is crucial that you prevent this from happening, especially on later stages. There's even a weather system. Each night, there's the possibilty of a rainstorm or blizzard. These  make hearing more of a strain.Your flashlight is your key to survival, and, as expected, it runs on limited power. I tried using it sparingly, only when the Boogeyman is on screen, but to regain battery life, you’ll have to look under the bed for batteries. But there’s always a chance the he’ll be down there, which makes the risk all the more suspenseful.My favorite part of this game is the animations. Similarly to FNAF, most of its clones lack any movement, and monsters are confined to still images. But not in this case. The Boogeyman is lanky and horribly fast, but lingers long enough for you to admire its sickening presence.Apart from some cheap moments when there were undoubtable two Boogeymen attempting to enter the room at once, I really did love this game. However, it is a bit pricey. Unless you want to beat the game on a harder difficulty setting, there really is no point in playing this twice, but I’ll be damned if that first time through wasn’t scary enough. If you want a cool and superior take on FNAF’s mechanics, give Boogeyman a shot. It’s worth it."

,Recommended,412770,20867576,"Posted: 31 January, 2016",all,Haven92,"This is a great game!A lot of people compare this game to FNAF and that is a fair comparison.  However I feel this game does the concept better from a gameplay perspective as I feel it is more skill based then FNAF.  You really feel in control of what is after you if you know what you are doing.  However, you have enough lack of control to make you very uneasy.  This is especially true if the Boogeyman just pushes an entrance open so that he can make a quick and silent entrance (which is a really cool idea btw.)The new update 2.0 has made this game no longer fully comparable to FNAF.  Barry (the games creator) has entered a territory of his own with making a hybrid where you explore the home before each night to find your flashlight.  These nights have been the most terrifying for me.  Although the ""nights"" are still scary but they could be more scary (more on that later).  A great job is done making you feel like something is ALWAYS watching you, just waiting for its chance to get you.The only complaint I have is some animations need a bit more polish, as they are just okay (especially the closet and basement animation). However, no animation is by any means bad.  I also feel like there should be multiple animations per entrance so you dont see the same thing over and over.  Don't get me wrong, it is stil scary regardless... but different animations would throw you off guard more and offer more variety.  Other than that, this is a great horror game for being made by one person.  It is definitely worth your time and money if you like horror games.I can't wait to see more from Barry in the future.  He definitely knows how to make a good horror game and I can't wait to see what he does next and I hope it's also a horror game.  But first I think he should polish this one up a bit more.  Regardless, as it stands right now, it is still worth a purchase."

I utilize a laptop with no middle mouse button and still managed to make to Halloween night first try before getting killed or even searching under the bed for batteries[normal difficulty, have yet to play the Don't Blink version]-Alternative versions of the boogeyman, or even alternative monsters. May appear rather far fetched and contrary to the purpose of the game, however I feel it would only be more to the player's enjoyment to experience the game against various nightmares. This is more towards the modding community rather than the developer's regardless.-Alternative bedrooms with equally alternative event items such as a ceiling fan, books being knocked off a shelf, clothes or clothes hangers falling, little dancer in the box, etc. Not asking for the more noises to relay the boogeyman's position, simply possible alternatives to the ones already in place, in differing situations/bedrooms. Events to a themed environment essentially. Halloween candy being spilled onto the floor during halloween night, snow gradually piling on the window sill during a blizzard that would may or may not be shoved onto the floor as the boogeyman climbs in, etc.Why the game should be supported:There is so much potential for this game, which is one of the reasons I enjoy it heavily in contrast to other immobile jump scare horror games[I despise most ""horror"" games that center around jump scares rather than atmosphere, this is one of the few exceptions due to how well it is executed in unity with promising gameplay] as the circumstances make sense in relation to the context. A little boy paralyzed with fear is very likely to remain in the safety of his bed with a flashlight when faced against the terror of the boogeyman, knowing that should he attempt to escape he may simply be dragged under the bed, whereas the idea of an underpaid security guard actually having the utter stupidity to not abandon their job and night shift when faced with animatronics coming to life is simply absurd[*cough* FNAF *cough*]. A child on the other hand is underdeveloped and vulnerable, in that they are far more likely to find themselves in that situation of being too frightened to move with nothing to defend themselves aside from a dying flashlight, especially when they are essentially confined/cornered to what should be their sanctuary and environment of security: the child's bedroom."

The game does look fun and I will try to update again after it goes live for Vive.Old review -When I purchased this game it was listed as HTC Vive compatible on the store page(now corrected).  Stuck with it even though I had not played it at all because at the time of the refund request it had been a little over a month since the purchase.  I do know it can be played on the Vive using Revive but thats like saying a Mac game is for PC because you can run it on a virtual machine like VirtualBox.  Also it launches SteamVR everytime it's opened so the Vive turns on and the audio it set to it.  If I close SteamVR the game closes so if I want to try the desktop mode I need to leave it running.  I may edit the review if Vive support is added which seems like it should be fairly easy at this time due to the Unreal Engine OpenVR support.

Graphically not a strong game but it's definitely not required in this case.From the start of the game they tell you where the Boogeyman can come from so you know what to look for; the window, the closet, the door and the vent. These 4 entrances make specific sounds so if you hear one of them you know he's coming for you.To survive you need to use your flashlight on the boogeyman. Beware not to use it too much because your battery power is limited. You can recharge your flashlight by looking under the bed for batteries. This is risky though; everytime you look under your bed there's a chance that the boogeyman is there. What I did is use it very sparingly and use the squint feature to look in the dark.After a little bit the game gets harder. The sounds the entrances make are randomized. The way the boogeyman enters are randomized. There is no way to tell what he's going to do, how and when.If you want some quick jumpscares for little money then this is a game for you.Check out my video below for my reaction to the game:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTmZnHavX7U"

His family took the deal for a new house bu something is not right. Mabye it is the electrical fails or Wierd Voices at night but there is always that that will stay there. His name is boogeyman...This game literally made me jump on a jumpscare so much that I jumped and hit the back of my chair and scared everyone watching the movie that was put on the tv.If you don't want to be scared too much you can turn off the house exploration but I am trying to not be a wuss soo yeah... More hitting my head against the back of my chair for me :DIf your into horror or want to get into the scaring experince try this. It doesn't take long to download. Just try it out for 20 min. and your be suprised how scared (in a nice way, boogeyman does that) you will be just from a tiny game.8.5/10"

All you need to do is listen for audio cues. different cues for where he will be..... however the game is glitched to no end.1. (The funny and not even a big problem glitch) You can be killed multiple times atonce....how?One boogey man gets you, then another?? Are they ripping me apart or did the one not know the other one already hit me with game over....and how is he killing me exactly? he doesnt even move after he grabs me....is his breath THAT hot?2. You shine your flashlight on boogeyman with plenty of time...sometimes the game wont register your doing it....aka you need to hit him with the light 300% more than you should.3. Sometimes even when hes got the spotlight of the heavens on him HE STILL opens the vent...door...or window.... If the light doesn't work then basically this is merely just a game that you just ....die....you play it just to die.....over and over, just sit on your bed and die...that's fun right???  Just dying for hours with no defenses? Did I miss something? Is there a button you can hit to pistol whip this alien?4. Once while I was reaching for a battery as he was coming up to attack on that side of the bed,  his head went through my face/the screen....should'nt he have killed me right then and there instead of waiting?"

However, when you play it, you will probably say WTF did I buy? Seriously. The game starts off with you standing in a hallway. You try and open doors and nothing happens. Then after reading a wall that contains a legend as to the controls, you may proceed down the hall and open the door. At this point you are in Thomas room on his bed. Nothing in the games limited instructions (the wall) indicates that you are sitting on the end of the bed and can not move, so you will mspend fifteen minbutes resetting the ghame thinking you are stuck with buggy controls, until you realize that you have to sit on the bed ad look around for the boogeyman. You are paralyzed with fear and have to keep looking left, right, up, down, for the boogeyman who will try and sneak into the room from one of those directions. When he does, you have to click the flashlight button and shine the light in his face. This is the entire game. You keep doing this over, and over, and over, and that is the entire game. BORING. To top this off, you have to keep doing this routine for a full 6 minutes of the clock each night, until morning arrives at 6:00 A.M. and then you are allowed to wander the house and look for something in one of three rooms that you are allowed to go into. There is a cassette tape dropped at random locations in these 3 rooms and you have to find it and put it in the cassette player to listen to some story dialog. BORING. After you collect whatever items are left for you in these 3 rooms, you go back to Thomas bedroom and repeat the same BORING 6 full minutes of sitting on the bed and looking left, right, up, down, etc, etc, looking for the boogeyman. This, is the entire game. 3 rooms containing the same crap and another cassette tape and repeatedly shining a flashlight in the boogeymans face when you spot him. YAY. I don't care if the game costs .50 cents. I would not buy it again and I wish I never had. Save your money because you will wish you had. This game sucks....BADLY."
