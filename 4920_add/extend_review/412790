Even just a few more levels, taking it to an hour or two of gameplay, would have been enough.I picked a ""yes"" recommendation because I do think it's a good VR experience, but it's a little over-priced as it stands."

It packs about as much content as a 12 minute episode of Adventure Time, plus an extra 48 minutes of gameplay. That's worth $5 if you ask me. That's less than the cost of hiring a minimum wage employee to entertain you for an hour."

It's clever and quirky, the controls are tight and the graphics are endearing. From what I understand it's not a very long game, but if it continues to provide the quality of the first level throughout the rest, I can see myself playing through it again and demoing it to a bunch of friends. For what you're getting, $5 is a steal compared so some of the shallower and more costly VR launch titles."

Yeah, it's short (~30 minutes to complete). But it's also only $5. Compared to most other VR games priced at $25+, I think this is priced fairly. If you like Adventure Time, you'll get your money's worth out of it."

The environment and voice acting is spot on and it is pretty fun playing from that perspective. One thing I would have liked to have seen would be some more characters from the show.
,Recommended,412790,22502069,"Posted: 18 April, 2016",all,No-Name,"I would not recommend this to people who want to play a long game. It's really N64 Style and I liked it back then and I do like it now again.Bad side: The game lacks content and gameplay variation off anything. From Enemy's to Attacks it's all really basic. Also the type off traps is like any old N64 game. Falling, open/closing or just simple timers.Good side: It's one of the first VR supported games with this type off content, and I wish they would extend there game to something more. For example: You can play as different characters in diffrents scenarios, like:- BMO in a quest to find new batteries >(Time Trail gamemode)- Marceline and collect new items for your guitar >(Search for items)- Ice King and try to find all the pieces for your ultimate princess >(Gameplay trough diffrent stages and hunt down something)Aslong as this game get's more content I would start recommending to others.6/10 For now."

Unfortunately the achievement system seems to be broken as I didn't unlock a single one (which would be impossible to do when playing the game).Hope to see more content in the future, or a longer sequel.

Nonetheless it is easily worth $5 for fans of Adventure Time. The animation, environments and voice-acting are excellent.In spite of being a third-person platformer, the game incorporates the player into the story, with Jake at times stretching out of Finn's backpack to talk to you (for example), so to a limited extent you still have the immersion of a first-person experience.I played on a DK2 using Oculus' 1.3 Runtime, and had no performance issues."

It says right on the page that it's only about 45 minutes of playtime so its not like they try to trick you or anything as some of the reviews make it seem. Visually beautiful, smooth controls, and movement abilities that let you make your own path if you want to. The camera was extremely well done so I had zero nausea. Didn't even focus too much on gimmicky 3d stuff, what it had was usually very organic and fit with the overall style. Highly recommend and hope they make a full length one."

But with the $5 price tag, I was happy with the enjoyment I got. I prefered this to any other Adventure Time game I've played so far, as the padding always dragged me down. It gives you the jokes it has and lets you enjoy what it has without stretching the game longer than it should.

Everything else is super generic with weak controls, sickness-inducing VR follow camera, basic level art and design.Music is pretty neat, but as a whole the game is not worth the time."

I'm sure developers will claim it's to ""minimize discomfort"" or something like that but just play in short bursts if you need a break. Anyway, all this to say that this game is short even by VR game standards. 30 minutes to beat and that's going out of your way for all of the collectibles. It doesn't feel complete: Why break the game up into levels if there's only 2 of them? Look, I wasn't expecting much for a $5 game but this hardly qualified as a game. Not even a demo. It feels like a Proof of Concept. I would like the actual game, please."

Achievements don't even work!This looks nice the whole time, but the game should have been in Early Access, because it only lasts 30 minutes (not 45 like the description says) and does not have a complete story!

Story (what little there is) ends abruptly. Price is reflective of the amount of content.Magic Man doesn't actually play games with your head. I was expecting more tomfoolery from this.I'd only recommend this for diehard fans of Adventure Time and for kids. I imagine it would be a decent way to get them to sit still for 30-40 minutes."
,Not Recommended,412790,28109988,"Posted: 30 November, 2016",all,jackson15j,"Pretty cool game, but surprisingly short (33mins and I missed one secret on the second level). Was expecting something substantial like most non-VR third person platformers, but can't really complain at the price I guess.The movement feels a bit unsettlingly floaty but that passed for me after a few minutes. Once passed that, it felt pretty rock solid. Annoyingly there are some points where you want to look around at something further to your sides, but as it is a seated/controller game, you end up having to manuever your character through your personal space so that the camera shifts over. Else you end up trying to crane over your neck in your seat.The platforming is alright. Slow and floaty jumps, but not too bad. This isn't Mario 64/Galaxy levels of platforming. More like early playstation B-list gaming, with a modern/clean/polished look. Something you would typically buy for a younger sibling.Annoyingly I would prefer to not leave a yey/ney. The game has me interested in what else the dev's might put out and for that I'd recommend it. However, just know that this is a platformer that feels like it would be on a demo disk rather than a full product. Good, but wish there was more."

But as I said it's half an hour, you get through it in one sitting and you feel satisfied in the end, but at the end of the day you still end up wanting more as this does feel more like a tech demo rather than a full game - but for the new price they charge it's well worth the money if you like anything Adventure Time.However I do wish that they'll get back to this type of game in the future cause it was quite fun but as stated, felt like a tech demo rather than a game. Maybe the next game could be episodic, where they release similar to this half an hour of content for each episode and make maybe a whole season worth of episodes (12-24 episodes)."

While the game is short it is still extremely fun and pretty much feels like you got dropped into a full length episode of Adventure Time.
