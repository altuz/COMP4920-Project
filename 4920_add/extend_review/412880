I can say that it was once a good game, but due to recent updates and recent events I no longer support the creator or the game.Drifting physics and controller support got very glitchy as of the miata addition, (A car that has been in the game files from day 1 wouldn't break the game)I was forum banned for no proper reason, see here;https://steamcommunity.com/app/412880/discussions/0/412449508291314237/JDM - Games creator says ""Ignore people like modnar"" do you agree?I digress there, relevant info to the game hereThe handling and controls are rather intuitive and easy for people to catch on early, however they become a problem and an annoyance down the road as it prevents you from controlling your car 100%, and they fight you in a similar fashion to nfs 2016's controls.The car list would be more impressive if all of the cars hitboxes and horsepower capabilities weren't all the same, the only differences in the cars being I believe there's 1 FWD mixed in, look out.Oh, and transmission gearings kind of make them different in-game SOMETIMES so that counts for something.All of the car models are blatantly ripped off from other games, notice how the models are flipped now? And on top of that the real car names were even used, remnants of this exist in the files and you can see it in regedit as well if not on the badges on the cars themselves.The ""body kits"" update was okay, the rim update was lackluster but I didn't complain. The steady stream of new maps, cars, and general content was good for the first month or so.Until people began to abuse broken code, change colours and glitch it out to the extent it would leave assorted coloured bubbles on your screen on the lens flare and other shadows and reflections about the map effectively making it impossible to play, gross impossible cambers, the disabling of collision (and they can still throw you around without collision too!) and addition of thousands of horsepower to ones vehicle.And then the updates halted, only to be seen once every 2-3 weeks with the addition of broken code and features that didn't really do anything. People began to quit, certain issues made the game unplayable for some and too difficult to figure out for others.This is where I came in, if people had problems, they came to me. I had over 100 players at any given time from DSJ on my list, and I couldn't go an hour without helping someone with something DSJ related whether it be in a private message on steam, or one of the hundreds of forum posts and threads on the official game or steam forums separately (Lots of em)I got people together for big drift events, did a ton of recordings with the community, and just rallied together support for it and hyped up every little update despite the circumstances while still running FREE tech support (the updates ♥♥♥♥ing sucked and were broken, look you can tell)Still JDM refuses to address the big bugs and it's been almost a month, if not so already since he broke the game in a bad way. He claims to have all this work done, well let's see it. You rolled out new content like it was a fancy carpet at first, what happened?TL:DR; I helped fix controllers and peoples games, and I got forum banned, all posts deleted and im :steamsalty:Used to be a really good game with a lot of potential until russian updates"

TL;DR AT BOTTOM.]This game used to be great, it had so much potential. Infact my original review stated ""The best $7 you would ever spend""DSJ was first getting off the ground, people were doing lets plays of it. JDM4iK suddenly had a way bigger follower base on the game.At the time, the game had great physics and a lot going for it. It was recieving regular updates with original content. It all went downhill from there.There was an MX-5 model in the game, and it was ready for release. It wasn't released until several updates later. Before that, there was: A track being changed into day, a multiplayer system, and chat.Ever since the chat system came out, it got worse. People were doing drag races, and blocking roads. Multiplayer got boring. Less updates were happening, less news was coming out.There was a physics update which made drifting a lot harder and a lot less realistic. The MX-5 update came out, with even more broken physics than before.As of this post, the update simply stole a map from Assetto Corsa and made physics unuseable.During the course of all of this, the community wasn't listened to one bit, and was permabanned for trying to speak up about all this going on.Before, I would have said you should buy this game. Now? I think it's just not worth it anymore.3/10. Stolen content, very broken physics, most of the real players have given up on the game.TL;DR: This game used to be the best driving game ever. Now it's just some horribly designed mashup of stolen maps and models. The community isn't listened to, and when someone points out something bad they get permabanned from everything."

But it's not fun to play. The physics can work but they feel...strange more often than not and the progression is ungodly slow with few things to break up the monotony. It's not 'realistic' enough to be a simulator but it's also trying to avoid being 'arcade' and doesn't really accomplish much.The options for graphics, gameplay, and controls are poor. This game looked a lot funner when it was released. I decided to give it some time to bake before picking it up in a sale, and I guess it baked too long and got burned. I hope one day it's nice again. I will change my review if that becomes a thing.I do really like the touge maps though. I was just hoping for something a little more like a modern IDAS."

Now the tuning is gone and its just bad physics. You cant even drift anymore, the car either just slides and you crash or it turns and you crash.

The gameplay and controls are garbage.  Gameplay consits of tapping left and right to slide about in the most simple way, you don't actually control the car just suggest which direction you want your car to spin, you don't have to touch the brakes ever and the car countersteers for you.  Braking will cause your car to actually lift into the air, never in a game have I seen a one ton car pull a stoppie.  Also, going around a corner is nigh impossible because of these problems if you're going more than 20kph(thats 12mph).

Welcome to NASA.-If your drifting try and use the e-brake or reg brake they always seems to instantly make the car go straight but not do anything to slow you down.-At speed the car basically refuses to turn.-It's been said in other reviews but no engine braking/ car stays at the same speed even off the gas.-Tracks look and feel like crap. overly bumpy. Kind of like all the terrain is made from flat pieces stacked and rotated.-Keeping the car sideways is basically a tap left and right game.-If it matters to you, your basically ghost riding. No driver in the car. (the steering wheel does turn tho!)-Other then color of the car and rims you can't do anything else to your car.The car tunning is basically camber. You can go stock or full retard both positive and negitive.-Buying an engine swap that comes OEM with a turbo doesn't give you a turbo to start with and engine levels are lower than what they produce in real life.-Mods are pretty basic. Block, head, pistons, intake, exhuast, ecu, turbo and nitrous.-Controller support is a lie. If mines plugged in the car just revs. Can't even switch to keyboard without a restart.-No control map or even a way to view controls. But if you've played NFS carbon the controls are about the same.-Stupidly small detail but your head lights work great! But your tail lights only work when you press the brake.-The money system is pretty simple/odd. No challenges or missions or anything to get money. 10k points = 100 bucks.Good.-Mad skids yo. Not really. I lied.-Cars don't actually look to bad.-in car view/ cockpit view.-Devs seem to be active. More tracks then the game originally launched with already.-Engine swaps. RB26 <3-Steady FPS.Weird? I guess.If you use the latest AMD drivers you may have odd graphical errors. When in the upgrade section the power gains for parts only show as the charts sliding over then aren't visible. But we all know AMD drivers suck.Pretty sure the games an ISO / Andorid port. I'm sure if I bothered to look into it I'd find it on the play store. At this time it's not really worth buying. But active devs, so hopefully all the issues will get sorted soon.

By way of separately concluded drifting competitions but these will be isolated. Most car games are usually competitive, or point to point running on stepping stones, so the grip is usually such a key issue as opposed to sliding.The game includes a few tracks and several Japanese brands of cars, which may wish to tune the engine more efficient but, the visual appearance can not be altered until further notice.High testimonials for this game.FIN:Itse olen autopelien fani ja lähestulkoon jokaista maailmassa olevaa suosituinta autopeliä kokeillut ja pelannut niin, silti tämän kaltaista peliä ei ole vielä julkaistu ikinä 3d muodossa ja näin ollen yksi maailman ainoita 3d muodossa pelattavia drifti - autopelejä, jossa rahaa voi saada pelkästään driftaamalla.Vaikka useita autopelejä on maailmassa julkaistu ja näissä pystyy haluttaessa driftaanaab niin, kyseiset pelit eivät ole tehty pelkästään driftaamiseen toisinkuin tämä peli.

Its great for an arcade style of drifting somewhat of how the Need for Speed series is as its not as serious or simulator like for drifting. The brake and hand brake can be glitchy as the creator behind the game tends to mess with it between updates. Feels like the game will be one day abandoned as he is focused on many projects all at once including new ones. It was nice when we had a lobby for many ppl to join and not be restricted to 12/16 but in the end this was a free mobile game ported to steam which i notice costs more than the 6.99 i originally paid.The game lacks real courses has a few cars that are nice to drift with, would be solid if the game had a 1st and 2nd gen rx7.Seems like the courses could be further refines and the track editor is very limiting also you cannot share the track editor online. Customization on the cars is mediocre while the game features a 93 honda civic hatch back with upgrading/swapping a rear wheel drive motor the car still stays front wheel drive making it the only car that can grip in the game. None of the other cars are grippy for grip racing as the game is set up for only drifting.I would recommend it if your a fan of drifitng but i would not pay the current cost of what is being asked for now.

I gave it a go on my Tx wheel using the th8a shifter and a handbrake...  I didnt expect things to work as well as they did.. There are a few things that I wish worked better or were different , such as when i press the brake iit would be great if it didnt go reverse and the power difference when switching gears are a lil off but i really havent explored weather that is changeable.. One other thing I'd like, when in cockpit view  it'd be nice if the camera didnt turn too far.  But overall, if you have a wheel and just plain love drifting this is a must have for the price.. More drift tracks and cars than I thought going in and it looks like there are a lot of mods to download on DSJ's own website/forum so thats really cool.."

No vinyl, No exhaust, No neon lights, nothing so that you can make a real JDM car. The only thing positive about this game is the sound effects.I hate that i wasted money on this game, so i recommend that you dont waste 5 euros on this game, until the game gets some major updates and more content. its not worth it.I give this game a 2 out of 10, but only because the sound effects are good, but if the sound effects was as broken as the rest of the game, it would be a 1 out of 10."

Besides this updates are being rolled out every day it seems and the game has improved dramatically since it's release.There are a few features I would like to see implimented into the game such as a chat box, players have no way of communicating with each other.Secondly there needs to be some sort of private lobby support, so you can play with your friends without running into other people online. Many people playing in Akina want to twin drift up and down the mountain however you're constantly crashing into other players.Thirdly the crash/bump physics need to be greatly improved, when you bump a barrier or another car you completely stop in your tracks, these pysics are and unrealistic just generally annoying to play with. Another thing I would like to add is the multiplayer needs some optimization, from your point of view other players cars are jumping around everywhere and overall look very buggy.Aside from the negaives this game is getting better everyday and I hope the developers stay focused and listen to their community to make this a great game."

Music volume can be controlled if you don't like it, engine/exhaust/tire sounds do their part well, and the visuals are a step-above the old NFS-Underground games.If you're looking to play with a controller, wait until full-support is confirmed, or don't bother as it won't work.(long story short, it's both game & controller related, involving trigger command-axis issues)That^ said, I have been enjoying the game with my Logitech G27, set-up to behave like a drifting go-kart of sorts. The game offers some level of 'customization', which devolves to body-color/wheel color combos, and what engine/perfomance-stage parts you choose. There are a fair amount of JDM cars to choose from, and PLENTY of engine-swap choices (my current/favorite combo is a ""S240"" [a.k.a 240sx] with a ~500hp KA24DE[-T] motor).The physics are arcade-ish, but feel more 'weighed-down' than the NFS2015 ""200mph EVERYWHERE"" behavior, think the old Underground games with a hint-more realism and weight.Is there $7-worth of content ? - debatableIs there $7-worth of entertainment in the game ? - I'd say yes;Between the solo-mode and the lag-chaos of online, the occasional online tandem (that doesn't end in cars getting launched to space - although still humorous) and the solo practice of finding the sweet-spot for your driving style and the cars perfomance, I could see anyone (who's done the research/effort and didn't just go ""GAME BROKE PLZ FIX) enjoying themselves for around 7-hours total."

,Not Recommended,412880,21306156,"Posted: 18 February, 2016",all,pez2k,"A quick summary: this is a very rudimentary release about a year of two of development away from being an actual game, and the store page hugely exaggerates the features on offer.Driving: Initially in the only available starter car, the physics seem decent with a fairly natural if exaggerated feel to the drifting. However, as soon as you add power or change to another car it starts to fall apart, with bizarre spins, slides and acceleration in unexpected directions. It feels more like a set of predefined reactions to certain inputs rather than any actual physics simulation, and once you deviate from basic powerslides it breaks.Graphics: The car models are serviceable if rather low-poly (ignoring the large holes in some), but the tracks are very, very basic - some games of the 1990s had more trackside detail. The 'traffic' only exists on one track, and seems to be mainly static cars with extremely low levels of detail.Gameplay: The only gameplay loop that exists is that scoring drift points gives the player a small amount of money per point, which they can use to upgrade then score more points. There is no other gameplay at all.UI: The menus are relatively clean and functional, however simply viewing any performance upgrade seems to immediately purchase it with no confirmation.Audio: The sound effects are passable, the highlight being the turbo sounds. The music is not to my own tastes, but the production is at least okay.Car culture: The choice of cars is well selected for a drifting game. While bodykits are only currently implemented for one car, and there are only 5 choices of wheels, the sheer presence of visual upgrades at least scores a point here. The engine swapping feature is also decent, although the stats for the engines generally bear very little resemblance to the real engines that they are named after.Overall: The game frankly lacks even the most basic levels of polish or even gameplay, and has some jarring inconsistencies in the quality of the art assets. While the developers clearly have put some heart into it and are continuing to work on the game, I wouldn't recommend a purchase now unless it's 90% off and you're happy with 20 minutes or so of just toying around. Hopefully the support keeps coming, and in a year or two this may be worth the budget price."

The cars are great, the upgrade system is nice, the maps are meh okayyy, but trying to play this game with a keyboard only (especially with all the drifting that requires to constantly change steering directions, releasing and pressing the gas to coordinate clean drifts) makes it a NIGHTMARE to control your car. Like I said this game COULD be a lot of fun, but being restricted to a keyboard in a game where the only way to play it properly would be with a controller, in all honesty, makes it really hard to enjoy.

Just going to go play Forza Horizon 3, a game that actually works and has good and decent mechanics. Yeah you guys brought some stuff back and removed that one ♥♥♥♥♥♥ idea of an update. Still this is what needs to be fix imo1. fix the breaking mechanics, when I tap my breaks before entering a corner it should not shoot my car off in the opposite direction spinning like a bat out of hell.2. Fix the shifting mechanic plz! Honestly I hate how I have to shift in this game.3. The handbreak needs to work as it should. I get the feeling none of you working on this game can actually drift or have no real idea as to how drifting works. The handbreak shouldn't cause me to loose speed like it does in this game.4. It should fully support the use of any controller the player uses. I use an Xbox ONE controller, some may use PS3 controllers and some might have the Steam Controller, and verious other controllers out there.Honestly I love the idea of what this game could be, but you guys seem to lack the skill to bring it to the level it should be at. IF the devs really grind away on fixing EVERYTHING wrong with this game it could become a great rival to Forza Horizon seeing as there is really no Competition to that game. I STILL DON'T RECOMEND THIS GAME. Guys if you have an Xbox ONE I suggest you get Forza Horizon 3 instead of this, if you own a PS3 or PS4 get Grand Tourismo 5 or 6. Cause this game can't even begin to live up to the level those two games have risen to."

There are some really fun things and some things that really bug me. I really like the modifications and swaps for the cars and that there is a modding commuinty i just wish there was more to it. some things the game really needs work on are 1. the physics are god awful. Ive never played a drifting game where ill just give the wall the smallest of love taps and it send me across the map going 200 mph. 2. the crs havge super odd hitboxes. i drice an rx7 fc that i downloaded and it still happens with other cars not just mod cars but the hitbox for the cars is like a foot larger than the actual car so half of the wall taps and crashes just make no sense at all cause you arent even close to anything. 3. sometimes the cars act really stupid and i know that sounds wierd but sometimes your car will literally just spin out... nobody knows why its not like youre smashing the E-brake or anything just sometimes taking a normal turn at a reasonable speed is enough to spin you out. That and if you are going full throttle you cant steer you car. Not like steering you car is important or anything but i played with it a little. you have to let off the throttle to turn the steering wheel ehich i thought was a little weird.Just mky overal thoughts about the game at its current time

Boy was I wrong... Don't get me wrong, the game has tons of potential, but in its current state, it is awful.-No in game way to change the uber confusing control layout-game detects my xbox360 controller but it doesn't work with it-MANY bugs, such as throttle that stays stuck on all the time, car won't shift gears in auto or manual mode, sometimes the car drives like its got a blown clutch, etcIn short I feel that if the devs stopped hiding behind the old ""its early access"" non sense and fixed this game it would be great.

,Recommended,412880,26136910,"Posted: 20 October, 2016",all,🔰 ★ Blu ★ 🔰 pvp,"So what i think would be great for the game is when you are tuning a car you should make it so when you upgrade it you inspect things like the motor and it changes when you upgrade it. I personally think you should get some more customization for the car so you can make the car you always wanted as a kid. Add like body customization, window tint, big nice rims and stuff like that.What would be good for online would be that you can choose what map you want to play. And i have noticed that when i play online my fps gets lower and drops more often, i think that is becuase it renders all of the map at the same time instead just a little bit of it. And add so you can talk with people like text press Y. Dont add mics but if you do make it so that you can turn it off in the escape menu so no one can annoy you while your drifting.But its worth the money."

Also every single car in this game has major understteer problems and feint drifting in this game is physically impossible ( you do not or should not have to use the E-Brake to feint drift look it up dammit) the dev should have thought about looking at racing scripts before uploading this to steam because it has some of the worst mechanics i have ever experienced plus it feels more like an arcade game. The inside viewmodels are absolutely terrible and some of the years on the cars are completely off. I do love the choices in cars and engines though; sadly this seems to be the only experience this dev had with cars  though because this game is so bad im considering a refund you seriously need to fix this now!!! AND BEFORE YOU SAY ITS ONLY 7 BUCKS WELL I COUULD HAVE JUST BOUGHT A REAL RACING GAME FOR THAT MUCH IT IS SERIOUSLY♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ME OFF!!! FIX IT NOW YOUU HAVE THE MONEY NOW WITH THE REVENUE FROM STEAM THIS IS TERRIBLE. Dont upload something if your the only person that thinks its right it feels like the damn thing wasnt even tested most of the tracks have invisible walls that halt you in you tracks. Also the engine rpms will drop if you excede certain angles WTF!!! What do you think happens when a tire has no traction you think it has a mind of its own and decides to drop rpm.............. You cant stop when going in revers your car simpoly glides backwards for 100 feet and they still have not fixed the controller support as of 2/20/2016 they clame they did but no no no they did not at all and the fix they posted has the potential to seriously mess up the game also the ""fix"" guide is so bad they dont even show you everything in the regedit which btw they want you toi edit if you want to play with a controller this should have been patched in so the average user doesnt make there game unplayable the creator of this game has no regard for the consumer only his buddies and doesnt care if it is unpayable because steam is already paying him for it."

I'm enjoying the game as it is, despite being in early stages. It's not your average arcade drifter where you can simply flick the wheel and become the next imagining of Takumi Fujiwara. It actually takes a bit of tweaking your car (with modifications and wheel alignment) and practice to get used to it all, which is exactly what I've been looking for.For being a $6.99 game, it's not expected to be perfect, but I believe it is worth it, granted if you can get past the initial aggravation of dealing with the physics. This game certainly has potential to become great despite its flaws or what it lacks and I hope the developers have a lot in store for 2016. In the meantime, I'll be sliding around the mountain in my 240SX, perfecting my drifting."

You can throw some of your favorite JDM cars around corners at ridiculous angles. And people are always online (at least in my area), and they are all pretty friendly. Not a whole lot of trolls. I would say, if you want to support the dev (single developer) and be in it for the long haul. This game is worth the purchase. If you don't want to deal with broken states, and buggy updates. This game may not be your cup of tea. I'm looking forward to all that's to come, and will continue to put more hours into this game."

So I decided to check it out.As the trailer started to play the first thing I noticed was the anti lag- rev limiter back fire (machinegun fire). This was the reason that I wanted to give it a try. For 7€.Loads of cars (for a beginning game) Great Icons and lots of tuning options. Engine swaps do fully mean another engine (my V8 240 sx is a beast) Engines are in par with their real life counterparts.This game still needs lots of content, but for 7€ This thing rocks.

I brought this game about a month and a half ago, at first it looked like a game full of potential but with not much to offer. After having a doubt for a day or 2 i finally decided that any game with a decent few cars and a few different maps was worth the small price of 5 pounds. i remember the first time i played it, i must of spent 2 hours on a row in the game, the game was so good and brought back some amazing memories back to when i was building my now 320BHP 180sx. i remember getting 4M drift score and losing it all on a wall cause the brakes where waay too weak. i remember buying that beautiful spirit R as its my dream car, i feel in love with it and since then is my favourite car. I recorded every step of the way, update by update to one day look back to  the beginning of this Amazing game. i knew by the regular updates that by time the game will only get better, but i had no idea it could happen so fast and for that im grateful JDM4iK. Just keep doing what you do and people get ready for the Best Racing game to ever hit pc :D good luck.PS: I can not wait to see them awesome bodykits on my cars and a few new rims. also i think we kinda need more upgrades and being able to tune the car, not big things. only necessaries and basic things that a real drifter would need to drift his car. a 1KBhp would be awesome to have and finally that really needed controller support :D I feel like im writing to Santa here haha but i have faith :D peace Mfukas!!!"

Also, the engine sounds of the cars aren't terrible, but they could be improved. As it stands, I'd give this game a 6/10. It's an alright game, but it's not amazing.

,Recommended,412880,20476151,"Posted: 11 January, 2016",all,Juan Chino,"This game is pure value. At only 7 euro, you get a fun, addictive and highly replayable game that is being constantly updated by the developers, at the time of this review, supporting even steering wheels with pedals. I've tried Logitech 920 and the feedback works just fine, the throttle has enough sensitivity, the steering is on point and the overall experience works very well. Also, for controller guys, the game allows the option to connect all kinds of third party PC controllers, as well as Microsoft's Xbox 360 controller. You will most likely not need a top notch PC for this game, as the Unity engine graphics keep it simple and the overall gameplay is not too sollicitating for your machine, so anyone can enjoy it. The develpoers are continuously updating the game's graphics and textures to work and look better, so no worries about that. The game itself is rather simple, consisting of car tuning and drifting it on 5 circuits at this time. Fortunately, the tuning is in depth, allowing you to swap engines and upgrade its components, such as the block, the turbo and the NOS efficiency. The gameplay is fairly simple, consisting of starting drifts in an aracadey manner then sliding continuously in order not to lose your combo. Some tracks actually require perfect throttle control to be able to keep the skid going, offering the game a certain skill-cap and keeping it challenging. The Multiplayer mode is a great chance if you want to practice tandems or simply have some fun with your friends, as well as meet new drifters. Aside from the scripters, trolls and bug exploiters which may sometimes appear on the server, the community is quite alright and it is unlikely you will run into any issues aside from the occasional server lag. Overall, even though the game feels a tad too much like an early access title due to its lack of content, its replayability and constant updates make up for this issue and offer the buyer an addictive and fun drifting experience. I highly recommend this game, as it is one of the better cheap and fun titles you can drop a few bucks and spend a few hours on. You won't regret buying this title."

Some front bumpers are wider the the fenders at the joinpoints, as if it is a widebody front bumper but noone botherd doing the fenders. Also, if you like tons of power, camber, and antilag backfire at rev limiter, then this game is for you.Here's some pro's and cons:PROS-Inital D (I think?) style graphicsGreat suspension tuning (Offset and Camber)Bad color choice possibilityWell designed tyre/tire smokeMultiplayerLevel EditorCONS-Crashes/Freezes/Stops responding during gameplay randomlyMultiplayer spawn car collidence issuesNo cosmetic modifactions (Other then wheels, and not many at that!)No custom colorsNo bodypanel editing (Removing bumpers, bonnets/hoods, etc.)My overall score would be 7/10.

So for £5 thought hey lets try. Read reviews from people playing only 0.1 or 0.2 hours and saying its bad. Far from it.At the time of this review i have played near enough 6 solid hours. And must say im still loving it! I would say a good hour is needed into the game to get some upgrades and learn the handling to make it more fun!Ive played many driving games over the years and modded games to enable drifting. But for once to jump straight into a drift game is nice.Pro's:Good selection of cars (so far)Good tuning optionsCar graphic qualityTURBO FLUTTEREase of earning moneyCon's:Some maps can be a bit glitchyLoose points from hitting bumps every so slightly (would like to see improved)Aside that its a £5 drifting game! Cant expect loads from it!Hope the work and updates continue as they have and look forward to the future!

Sure it's got it's pro's and con's, but in my opinion, the vast amount of different ways you can tune your cars settings weighs out the con's. People who gave this game a negative review likely didn't play it long enough to understand the game, and actually think on how they can make the game be fun for them.I love all of the tune settings, not the upgrades, but the tiny changes you can make to your wheels, grip settings, drive load options (4WD / RWD / FWD / etc). Each settings literally plays a large role in how your car handles, you can't create a ""perfect setup"". Because every setup has its flaws because that's just how things roll, you can however master your setup to allow your car to drift the way you want it to. Whether realistic drift (which I prefer) or ice drifting for Tandems.(All my opinions, I've got a pretty fair amount of hours within the game, and knowledge about things under the hood of the game.)Pros:Fair amount of car optionsEach setting when Tuning your car plays a noticeable roleMore than fair amount of players still playingVery mature players, hardly any xbox kidsFriendly community, Drag Race events, Drift races, Tandems, etc.only 5$, like seriously. It's just 5$.Nice looking bodykits for certain carsAbility to create your own mapsAbility to use modded vehicles and maps (modded vehicles as in vehicles created or imported by other players)Fair racing wheel support (Logitech G27 is the most popular and best working apprently)Large community within ForumsGAME IS NOT ABANDONED (DEVELOPER IS ON A VACATION TRIP, CHILL OUT PEEPS)Fair amount of maps to choose fromEasy to use hotkeys (Reset Key, Autosteering Toggle, Repair Vehicle, etc)Tofu Hachi Roku (puts on shades)Auto Countersteering can be disabled through recent updates (THANK GOD)Collision is Disabled (Helps prevent pesky trolls from messing up your sick driftz)Cons:Physics can be wonkey when hitting walls at certain anglesMoney can be fairly hard to earn by purely drifting alone (Which most people end up Registry editing their money and then claim they drifted all of it)Small amount of body kits and style features for small number of cars.Engine sounds can get a little tedious to listen to (especially if you're redlining the absolute F*CK OUT OF IT FOR THAT SICK DRIFT)Akina map is very rough and can't be properly drifted on at highspeeds, or even medium speeds :(Few rim stylesVery basic colors to choose from for rims and the car body (would love to be able to put Vinyl designs)"

,Recommended,412880,28209733,"Posted: 5 December, 2016",all,Alo,"The game has potential, but is not fully complete physics wise.It seems to me, that the tyre grip model has been made in a weird way - The car has to be a certain deg sideways for the wheels to start spinning, when you go straight, the wheels will not spin, even if you clutchkick. When you let go of the throttle, car starts acting very weird and grips instantly, making it nearly impossible to chain different drifts or to end one unless you are living on the handbrake 24/7 (still making it very hard to stop a drift).This is pretty much the only negative side to the game, but has a huge impact on gameplay, really something to be sorted out in the future (i hope so atleast)I really hope developers read this, because this game is unique in a way, just needs to be optimized to fulfill it's goal properly :)"

,Recommended,412880,31817087,Posted: 17 May,all,Marijuethampheroin,"there are no real objectives, it is incredibly easy to hack, and there is exactly zero discernable moderation of the homophobic, transphobic, racist, foul-mouthed adolescents that this game seems to attract.these things, in most cases, would put off any reasonable consumer. yet, in the case of Drift Streets Japan, these things decidedly have contributed to it's status as an instant, timeless classic, at least in my opinion.most, not all, but most of your favorite legendary Japanese sports cars are available here, ready to be upgraded and tuned to your liking. having the option to adjust things like camber and offset of wheels, wheel size, and drivetrain makes for some very interesting final products. want an AWD FD3S that grips the track with the power and focus of a well-built R35? you can do it. want an Evo with all it's HP in the back wheels so it'll slide? easy. and with a quick and simple edit to the game's registry files, you can lift up your Miata on 66"" wheels like ♥♥♥♥in' Grave Digger and impose your presence with blatant disregard for other players. also through regedit, you can make any car a hovercar.but the core of the game, which is tuning and drifting your dream JDM cars, is fairly solid, and will entertain anyone with a passion for these vehicles for many, many hours, and I think that's probably worth the $5 JDM4iK asks for.from what I understand, the things they've put out aside from DSJ are terrible, but anyone interested in JDM cars or drifting should check out this one."

Graphics are NOT that good like in the screenshots. It's crashy (those 2h with 2 bumps mehhh....). Whole time I was recording fps was swithcing between 75fps to 65fps every 2-4 sec. Dead online? Well there are people in almost every server. Strange money system. If you drift long god gives you money. BTW: if you're struggle with money just open up the game files. There are some tutorials on YouTube. And in the cash named game file (are you serious?) exact amount of money you have .No script. Just enter the amount you want. Customization - trash. Parts aren't even even conected to the car. If you samash your car end enough spoiler will float in the air. Physics: Car looks like stepped on beer can - engine is working, wheels are turning... everything's fine. Ram into a wall - competely crushed front. Kinda toxic community. A lot of good cars you'll have to download with mods. My wheel setup almost pooped itself - strange deadzone angles, no back force... Game feels unfinished.

,Not Recommended,412880,20314257,"Posted: 4 January, 2016",all,Drummerkid51,"*UPDATE*Okay, so my original impression of this game was extremely positive. Price was low, drifting was actually super fun, and it was a fresh idea. Each update brought something new to the game, and I was genuinely enjoying my time with it. After a few months, they started messing with the handling. This is where it went downhill, in my opinion. At first the handling felt like it had some weight to it, and the controls were smooth. Now it feels like you're driving a piece of paper. Trying to hold a line is insanely aggravating, and turning feels extremely touchy. There's a nice bug where you'll barely tap the brakes and your car goes spinning like crazy. Also, it seems like it's damn near impossible to even go in a straight line anymore, so you're constantly fighting with the touchy steering. I'm sure some people still find this game enjoyable, but for me, that ended when they started messing with the handling. I can't play for more than a few minutes without getting annoyed. It's a bit disappointing really. I had high hopes for this game in the beginning, but unfortunately now I can't recommend it, even for $5.ORIGINAL REVIEWFinally a decent attempt at a drifting game. For $7, it's worth it. Even with only an hour into it, it's been super fun. It definitely has its flaws, as will any new game, but hopefully the developers will continue to work on this because it has potential to be awesome.Wish list:- More vehicles- More exterior customization (wheels, headlights, bumpers, skirts, wings, hoods, etc)- Driver (just a moving steering wheel in an empty seat makes the cockpit view lose immersion)- Better sound (car sounds and music come in and out constantly - had to mute the music for now)- Better control over throttle (in auto shifting, throttle response is laggy)- Better collision affects - maybe add an option to toggle collision with other players- Optimization for higher resolutions - playing in 1440p and have a weird box- Move the point indicator to a different position - definitely gets in the way all the time- The option to host a server and options/rules for that server- Customizable speedo and tach (colors, size, position)A big list, yes, but these are things I would definitely like to see out of a game with potential. I would recommend taking a lot of influence from NFS Underground 2 in regards to customization."

If I haven't already said enough, for the tuning options the possibilities are endless not only to the car of your choice but the stuff you can do to the engine and the variety of engines you can choose. For example a LS1 or a VQ or Rb or even the classic 2JZ. But it doesn't stop there because as well as making an awesome game you can make your very own levels in the level customization. but one thing that everyone wants in a drifting game is... you guessed it, multiplayer, guess what? They have multiplayer in this game.Drift Streets Japan gets a 9/10 from me yes it is a great game as I have already stated but one mark was taken off because of the damage physics where when you for say bump into a barrier you can sometimes see through the car but also you don't collide with other players when online, you just go though them.This has been my review on Drift Streets Japan Thank you for reading if you have read it, I'm Happy Hamburger Peace."
