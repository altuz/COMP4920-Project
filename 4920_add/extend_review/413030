Like the RPG/turn based idea. It gets annoying when you don't get the stones/cards you need and you are e.g. lvl 12 and get killed by sth lvl 10. Also, the regeneration bonus is ridiculous. 4hp in 1500 hp (lvl 15) every few seconds? Start another game, go out , watch a movie or read a book while you heal, because if you go b to base, all the creatures respawn.Apart from some serious lag issues, which got me killed several times, there are almost no people playing it. So how come you have an ""online only"" game with no people online? I already knew that few people were playing, but I never imagined such a little number. All the players of my lvl or of similar lvl I asked for a party declined it. Moreover, there are very few weapons and equipment available, not even one per lvl.Apart from this, they elevated the price from 3.99 or 4.99 to 9.99, so that they could release some DLC at 4.99 ONE month later... I cannot support any company that does that kind of shady things. Besides, the basic game just gets you to lvl 30, while the DLC pushes it to 40, so you'll have to buy at least 5 more DLC packs. For me it's either launch the whole game or just don't... Selling content that could have been added when the game was launched is just wrong for me.So, rounding up, I would only recomend this game if you buy it when it's on sale, and if you have some friends to play it with.Hope I helped."

The combat system is like no other MMO however.  Basically you collect stones (think of them as cards in a deck) and build your rotation with the stones you've collected.  There are many possibilities and a good amount of random chance which keeps combat interesting.  It's a nice change of pace to have to think on your toes in an MMO."

Also its more of an on rails game than an mmo with freedom.  There was lag during gameplay which I saw no reason for as no one else seemed to be online.If the game took away the need for an internet connection and launched itself as a single player game then I would recommend it but as it is I can not.  If the devs closed the server you would be left with a game you can not play.  With the lack of players Im not sure how long the devs can continue to support this game.

,Recommended,413030,19718822,"Posted: 15 December, 2015",all,Burnout,"I played Mytheon back when it was released in the Beta format around 5-6 years ago and I loved it. Despite my horrid internet connection back then I found myself pouring hours and hours into the mythical world this game presented to me and now, 5 years down the line I was beyond ecstatic to see that the game was getting a re-release on Steam and bought it as soon as I was able.Delving back into the game after all this time I was hit by a wave of nostalgia when I was presented with an interface I'd spent so much time interacting with all those years ago and despite the janky gameplay style, I couldn't have been happier; it was exactly how I remembered it. The stone system is a unique gameplay aspect that I've never seen replicated in any other game and it's this aspect that I think gives this game its charm.The only real issue I have is the re-introduction of the Legacy weapons (big shiny blue ones) that used to be a badge of honour for Beta players which is now just an easily attainable pay for weapon which pretty much renders most other weapons completely irrelevant once obtained. I'm not sure what you devs are planning on doing with these weapons down the line but I hope it doesn't remain an accessible weapon for all in the future (as elitist as that makes me sound).All in all I highly recommend this game to anyone who doesn't mind a semi-dated experience filled with nice and unique gameplay and a lore-rich world that really tickles the fancy of any Mythology head such as myself. I hope you guys in the dev office keep up the good work and polish this game into the wonder it has the potential to be.Cheers <3"

I never would have thought that deck building and action RPG could work together so well.Probably the biggest problem is that the major bosses seem to be balanced for a full group, and 1 or 2 players have almost no hope, at least not until their decks are rather polished.But the positives far outweigh the negatives.  I love that you can put an increasing number of cross-class cards into your deck as you progress.  I also love the variety of cards, the atmosphere, and the combos."

The textures are a bit dated but the gameplay is as fun as ever. The game plays like an instance-based MMO. You can party people and go in instances to fight enemies for gear and stones (ability cards). Your skills are all based on building decks of stones (abilities) that are continually regenerated at random while fighting in an instance. The random abilities keeps things interesting. There is only an online mode. You can solo if you'd like but playing with others is much more beneficial because you can stack AOE attacks.

76561198045999415,Recommended,413030,19766088,"Posted: 18 December, 2015",all,Elephiant,"Mytheon is a Hack and Slash MMO RPG with strategy elements set in ancient greece with evil gods and courageous heroes. You play one of these heroes and your goal is to defeat the gods.TLDR:- Gameplay may feel stiff/boring at first, but when playing a little longer with more challanging situations the strategy in the game comes out better. The stones collections, towers, companions and abilities certainly make a nice mix to play with. Shame there are few people though.- graphics are okay though not impressive when global lightning is overwhelming. More moody areas look fairly nice.- Music doesn't really draw my attention so far, but it's not bad.= Though it's not a GREAT game it deserves more attention than that it has now. You may find this game♥♥♥♥♥♥and boring, but it can also be quite interesting, unique and fun to play.There are 3 classes to choose from (I've only played the Elementalist, so I might be a little unclear about the other classes):- Warcaster: heavy equipment, melee fighting- Eidolon: between Warcaster and Elementalist- Elemetalist: focuses on spells, towers and companions, quick mana regenThe basic gameplay is just to smash every monster you see and take all loot like in many other hack and slash rpg games. Leveling up simply increases your stats, nothing shiny there. What makes this game interesting (besides it's setting in greece if that interests you) is the stones you can collect. Sounds boring? Didn't catch me at first either :p. However there are stones you can collect and put in you ""batte set"". Your battle set is a set of stones you can use during battle. For it to be usable it has to contain between 15 and 40 stones. On the bottom of the screen 6 stones are displayed. These stones are randomly picked from your battle set. You can activate them (if you aren't in a safe area) by clicking them or by pressing there corresponding number 1-6.There are basically 3 types of stones:- Companion: summons a companion to fight beside you. By pressing F you select all companions and by clicking on anywhere else you deselect all companions and select yourself. You can move yourself and each of you companions seperately like you do with units in an RTS. Companions disappear after a certain time and have different HPs.- Towers: towers are the same as companions except that they can't move and often do more damage and have higher HP.- Abilities: abilities like in any other RPG game.You start with a basic battle set of 15 stones and can find more in loot. You can also craft stones by using ingredients or by creating them out of 2 or more other stones.Companions can be of 3 different types:- attacker- defender- rangedthese types follow Rock Paper Scissor:- attacker GOOD AGAINST ranged- defender GOOD AGAINST attacker- ranged GOOD AGAINST defenderI'm not yet shure about the damage types, but there are 6 listed of which 4 are elemental:- melee- ranged- fire- water- air- plantwater GOOD AGAINST firefire GOOD AGAINST airair GOOD AGAINST plantplant GOOD AGAINST waterAll companions, spells tower, and weapons can do elemental damage (not necesarily) and all can have/boost resistances.This makes it important to choose the righ way to attack, because (e.g.) fire against fire does very little damage.You can trade with NPC's (in the hub) and put items on sale for other players (or buy their items) by paying a small fee. Beside the standard coop gameplay you can play pvp 1v1 or 2v2 in an arena. Haven't tried this yet because currently there are simply to few players. There is a tutorial, though it's all in text, so for the less patient (like me) it might be less fun to learn the basics. Certain tutorial text pops up when you visit certain areas. It's all explained pretty straight forward in few words, so it's not that bad. All tutorial text can be found in the journal at any time as well.Though the music is made by Frank Klepacki it didn't really stick with me. It also seems that there are very few tracks, the music feels repetitive. It's not bad, but (so far) I didn't really draw my attention. Though it's a 2010 game the graphics didn't impress me at all at first. When you get a little further in the game and there are more lightning effects, it looks fairly nice though."

I will include a TL;DR for all your ""helmet-wearing, crayon eating, Mommy's little snowflake types"".First and foremost, this is most definitely an MMO in the vein of an instanced dungeon-crawler. (Think Path of Exile/Diablo 2-3, etc.) The game is based upon mythology ranging from Ancient Greece to Egypt (Though that content has yet to be launched, the ability to access the NPC to go to the hub is in-game.) Instead of standard abilities and levels, this game uses ""stones""; think cards that are randomly dealt to your from your ""deck"" (Active Stone Set). The game is most definitely designed to be difficult but fair, and will not cater to the weak! (One of the strongest points in my opinion.) After level 10~, this game really starts to push the whole MMO concept, IE working in pairs/groups. Without one, you will struggle/trudge through the dungeons as the difficulty INSTANTLY goes up. This should not discourage those looking to play single-player, however let it be known, your life will definitely suck while you grind away in misery.The questing is pretty standard in this game. Collect X of these, Kill Y of those, etc etc. While this is a tried and true method, it is dull BUT it works! Each individual also has 'FEATS' which are a set of instance quests you don't have to pick up, they are already in journal, you just have to complete them in a single run of each particular instance. They reward you with items, gold, and XP. Overall, questing/FEATs are simple and effective and lend to leveling quite well.I won't comment on the classes because they lend to your particular playstyle. Warcaster has more summons of ""creatures"". Eidolon has a mix of spells and summons. And the Elementalist, lots of spells and some pretty awesome creatures. To each his own in this aspect, you decide, I am not biased in the least.The gameplay is smooth with nifty animations and has been completely lag-free for me. The game isn't graphically intensive so those of your running your mother's old toaster, you should be just fine! +1 in my book.There is an in-game auction (Broker). Works as intended, helps to get whatever you may need. +1No bank/storage as of yet, however you can buy 5 bag upgrades. Each bag holds 20 items I believe? So yeah, 100 damn things, that's plenty. Push comes to shove, make a mule. So this is one of those in the middle things. I don't feel strongly for or against.The biggest issues this game is suffering from right now though, is a lack of players. If this game was vitalized by a healthy surge of players, I can easily seeing it being a niche title with a fair playerbase if people would just give it a shot. I said what the hell for $3.50 and you know what? It was well worth it. (Cough it up, cheapskates! You don't need to go buy another pack of smokes, buy this instead.)Overall, this game is a decent instance dungeon-crawler, hack/slash (per say) with definite needs for strategy. I would definitely recommend the Steam community give this a whirl, as it isn't as bad as one might think.TL;DR - Instance-based dungeon crawler with random ""deck"" of spells/summons, need for strategy, and a fun game. Polish is definitely here, needs a little more (but what doesn't?) and a great MMO in the vein of Path of Exile/Diablo.Thanks for reading!"

Give me a game where I can CAST SPELLS, in a normal turn-based or real-time sense You can't do that in this game, at least not the first two levels. If you just want to melee and kill stuff I guess it's an OK game. It's one of those games that tries to be cute with some unorthodox RPG system. Well if it doesn't even work, it sucks. And as far as bait and switch, FYI I choose the healer class, go to the town, and lo & behold, NO gear for my free to play class. Gear for the other two classes, but not mine."
