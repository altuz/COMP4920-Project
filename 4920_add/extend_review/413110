Please take a grain of salt/actually read the negative reviews.  They predominantly like the game, they are just trying to warn anyone that doesn't understand the concept of ""Alpha"" builds.Again, remember that you are purchasing this game because you BELIEVE it will be good, not because it is CURRENTLY perfect.That being said, there are SO many cool things about the game, even now.  It really is trying to shift to a new way of doing rpgs, and it's a great idea.  No more just spamming clicks on screen and paying zero attention to townsfolk.  There is truly a thinking/planning undercurrent that modern rpgs have been straying away from.Know this - this game is not a hark back to old things.  It adopts a lot of new, innovative, and super fun ideas.  The fact that zombies walk a little too fast for 12 hours before being patched should not give this game a bad name.Give these guys your $20, you will not be sorry!"

I will probably change this review later on, but I think it was very pre-mature from dev to release this game into early access. As of now the play feels like very rough Alpha stage of the game.Of course I understand, they need feedback and bug catching, but I think they had enough testers from IndieGoGo campaing, who received access to it's alpha.I still have my fingers crossed, that they will fullfil their promise and time plan and I will gladly change this into positive review."

As other reviews are saying, if you like the look of the game and want to support the developers -- buy it. I can tell that this is going to be a good game, but right now there isn't that much to do and what is there isn't polished.However, the 3 hours I've played at the time of writing this review have been fun (although I spent at least half of that time exploring one single tile of the map that was supposed to have a dungeon in it until I eventually gave up...those tiles are BIG). The world generation system (gods) and the variety of classes are the best things about it at this stage, and there's plenty more planned. Everything the developers say they'll implement between now and final realase sounds awesome.I guess the main negative for me is that you've got no direction when you start the game up -- and even though exploring allows you to discover towns, dungeons and events on the map, the map tiles cover such a wide area it's difficult to find the point of interest. But hey, maybe that's just my bad navigation skills.It's also worth noting that I haven't tried this in multiplayer yet, but I reckon it'll be a lot more fun with friends even in its current state and I'm especially looking forward to playing on big servers when the cap is raised to 200."

I did not even hear about the game until a couple of days before it released onto steam, but I did watch all the footage I could find of people who had backed it and were playing it. Even on its first day of EA on Steam, it's fun in my opinion. There is not much to do currently, to the point of there not even being any chests or anything in dungeons so far as i've been able to find, but what is there - the core mechanics - make the game a lot of fun. They also released a patch within the first 12 hours fixing a whole lot of bugs, some of which I had experienced myself.TL;DR:+Core Mechanics are fun+Patches are sizable and frequent so far+Will eventually support 200 players concurrently on servers+World Generation is awesome+Maps are huge. Even the smallest setting.-Not much to do yet. It doesn't really stand up as a game yet, but I did enjoy it-Obviously, in such an early stage, bugs are pretty prevalent. Looks likely they'll be fixed swiftly.Most people should buy once it's fleshed out a bit more. If you enjoy the core concept and don't mind bug hunting as your main source of fun from the product, buy it now :)"

It's not balanced or perfect or even fully developed yet... but you can see the potential in it.I wish there were more ""OH COOL"" moments in the random world. (Minecraft, in spite of being blocks, has those awesome vistas that you can see. This 2D world doesn't have the same in it.)The world building is rudimentary, but intriguing. There's a strange history of the world. I hope the gods feature more prominently in the final product because it's a neat device.There's a lot of trial and error. This reminds me of early EverQuest, when you had no idea what was going on... and that's a good thing.So... if you want a Diablo-style 2D action RPG, this one is worth following. Maybe not buy it, maybe buy it. It's early, but I am enjoying it."

I love the NPC interaction some dwarves threatened to split my skull it seemed to be in response to me stealing there mobs.  My only issue is the huge amount of time I spent looking for a dungeon.  I was expecting way more issues after all it is an alpha.  I have not tried the multiplayer yet but its worth its sale price just for solo game alone.  I usually do not like permadeath games but for some reason the challenge of avoiding the underworld makes game play more exciting.  Theres a huge selection of classes and races avaliable already.

Going out in the forest IRL is not the same as exploring in a video game. When you explore in a video game, you expect to find something every 60 seconds or so to excite you or surprise you. If its out there now, I will tell you the game world is too big for the speed in which we travel.-Super simplistic item system for such a complex and large game world will be an instant snoozefest. You need an awesome item system in a game like this.-AWESOME classes... I love the large selection of classes.-No reason to play multiplayer.Ending advice... When you build a large world sandbox game, you don't just make a huge world and throw trees in it and say we have a massive world. You need things to do in it and you need REASONS for everything. Right now, I see no reason to have a huge world. No reason to endlessly walk around.... (Which I did for 4 hours)... The loot is so lackluster....If this game is 5% complete it has MASSIVE potential.

There is still alot to add to the world history aspect, examples being God events, Magical item events, race extinctions. All of which have been talked about being included into the final product.The game currently lacks some basic components to keep the player captivated, Such as quests, Rewards in dungeons, Boss monsters that provide some sort of challenge. But each will be fixed and added as time goes on, the main thing to keep in mind here is that it IS just being released and IS NOT a complete game.So far with today being the initial release onto steam early access, after having a week of alpha 3 for all indiegogo backers, the dev team has already made one or two patches on the first day. Along with 2-3 patches during the alpha 3. The impression this leaves me with is that the team IS very committed to helping players along and keeping them happy with new content updates and fixes for exsisting/new problems.Hopefully over the next coming days we will see some more of the core gameplay added in, to help keep players interested in the game. Along with some cooperation with dedicated server hosts, to allow dedicated server hosting off site like with other games such as LIF:YO and ARK:SE.This is an Indie game, it is a small new studio putting it out, the game seems very solid and so far the amount of decite has been minimal if not non-exsistant. I'm sure someone will bring issue with that statement, but they will not get a reply from me. All i have to say about it is, as long as they are nothing like the makers of No Man's Sky, its worth the buy lol, especially to see the final product."

And, not a particularly good one at that. The user interface for combat is brutal in an old school (but not good) way. You are assaulted by fast moving, small sprited creatures that are a pain in the butt to click on.That irritation will cause you to die, a lot. So much that you'll wonder why you bother.And you should wonder, because there isn't anything to do anyway except for wander around and die. The map is horrific and though you'll see things like ""points of interest"" and ""dungeons"" indicated, good luck actually finding them. You'll wander around endlessly looking for a dungeon entrance as you are assaulted by bees and bats. Because they are so hard to click on, you'll eventually die to them - over and over again.The world is also sprinkled by NPCs that spout inanities to each other but that you can't interact with - at all. Well, that's not true, if you run into them, you can kind of push them.The entire experience feels like one giant placeholder.I love the concept of the game and I hope it develops into something excellent, but right now they are charging money for access to something that doesn't actually need external ""testers."" Surely everyone working on the game can see that there's no game there yet. A few friends and family alpha testers could tell them the same thing.I love the work that these guys did with EQ back in the day, but this level of early release is a huge disappointment.You can do better guys."

After swearing not to support Smedley, ever again, I tossed in the 20 bucks and went to town. I died a LOT in my first few hours, but I finally got the hang of it, and I am level 12 or so now.My thoughts:Pros-The world is HUGE. I am pretty sure that you could spend weeks, if not months, exploring only a small world. I am terrified of the medium or large.-The artwork is nice enough, and the music is well done.-The game didn't crash or lag for me, and it seemed relatively bug free.-Plenty of things to harvest, and plenty of things to craftCons (There are many, but the game is still in early release)-Lack of any directions or support. For example, pick axes. Nowhere does it show that they are one time use. Nowhere does it say that there is a level requirement. While it does say what type of ore each land type will produce, it has to be a specific type of ground in those land types, and there is no clear indicator of what these look like.-Imbalance between classes. On the first 5 classes that I played, I am pretty sure I didn't even survive the 15 minute mark. There is no love for melee classes. You will get crushed. And it seems like craftable plate gear has the same protection as craftable cloth gear. I hope you like ranged classes! The illusionist rocks. I am level 12, and I am tearing through level 50 mobs with a copper staff. I still have all of my other base gear. Nothing can touch me. The class is way overpowered, but gives you the most chance to see the game right now.-A common complaint is the size of the map tiles. The grid is on an X,Y axis, and each map tile is 50x50. You can see which tile a town or a dungeon is in, but it doesn't get any more specific than that. I spent over an hour in one tile looking for a dungeon entrance with no luck. They really need to update the map.-The lack of configuration settings is appalling. When you start the game you can choose your resolution and high/med/low graphics. In the game you can change music volume and sfx volume. That is it. When you go to the key mapping screen, it is blank. They really need to turn over more of the controls. Customization would likely make this much more palatable for many players.-Crafting is both a blessing and a curse. While there is a lot to craft at the beginning, there isn't much to explain how you get better patterns. Are they unlocked at a particular level? Do you find them or buy them? No idea.-NPC interaction isn't that great. If you go into ANY house in a settlement, there is a generic vendor that has a handful of generic items-Item price imbalance: Weapons that you find on orcs? Worth 1 gold. Dull feathers that you find on the ground? Worth 52 gold....-Broken exp tables: Orcs, whether equal level or 30 levels higher only give 10xp, while other mobs of equal level give up to 1,000.Final review: There is a lot of broken stuff, but there is plenty to do. You will get your 20 bucks worth, even if there are some annoyances."

It is playable and bugs I have seen are limited to:1.  On joining world, sometimes my charaters are not available, so I have to restart application to fix.2.  Hover over menus sometimes do not go away when you move mouse.3.  Backpack item disapeared [not item within, but the bags you attach to give you more room]No crashes on my system, and I consider this a playable alpha.Combat control has been fairly good, but in a crowd with trees, you cannot see what you are doing.  Not sure if this is intentional- meaning it is player's job to avoid treeline during fight.   The pace of combat is not frantic, and I have seen monsters chase the character and then retreat when they are in danger.  Bats seem to hang out in the tree line and not directly confront an armed player.  Gnolls have been keeping distance and then 2 or 3 at a time leap towards player.  This is good in my opinion.Generally, you cannot tell where you are and if you encounter a long thin obstacle, you cannot know which side is inside until you walk the length.  This must be fixed because  it is annoying to back-track around.There is crafting, of which I am not a big fan.  The upside for me is that you do not have to go to a forge or vendor to create items.  If you have the stuff just utilize on the road.  That is a good decision for me.  The only restriction is that you need campfire to cook stuff, but you can deploy that on the fly as well.World creation is a stroke of genius, because you select a crew of dominant demi-gods to seed the creation and you must pick an antithesis which will challenge you if you die.  I had the chaos demi-god in my 'Hades' and had to fight through a maze to return to life.  I tested whether a character in one world is available in another and the answer is no.The key to whether you like this game  is how you respond to games where the narrative is generalized."

It is Alpha! I think that one should keep an open mind about gameplay until we progress to a Beta level.The world is friendly but also harsh and quite unforgiving. Death is the end, unless you can survive the 'second chance underworld'.My Story, thus far...I woke up in the woods surrounded by brethren of my kind. I am a Beastmaster, master of the beasts! I decided to explore the nearby woods and discovered a log and feathers on the ground. After collecting many items, I found my first fight. A band of gnolls were battling a pack of wild bees when I happened upon them. They did not notice me as I carefully took aim with my bow.Two-three arrows later, I discovered that ranged bow is cool.I looted the dead and made my way back to the town. There are four shops in town. I was able to buy health potions with my feathers and such. The weapons looted from the enemy yielded a whooping one coin. It did not make sense, but an economy is an economy.I went back out and dispatched a few more enemies (gnolls, spiders, wolves, orcs) then found myself with the skill points to tame a wild beast. This is where my smile turned into confusion and later to a frown.The only tamable beast happened to be a Dire Wolf (any variety). A level 1 pet that simply did not reach any level of credible expectation -considering I am a BEASTMASTER!!!Well...yeah...the wolf died over and over. After finding and taming my fifth Dire Wolf, the icon tray suddenly appeared on the GUI...alas, it did not work. In the end, mobs simply mauled my level one Dire to the point that I did not want to play the class any longer, opting to wait until it is better polished.(Did I mention shooting my Dire Wolf in the knee? ...instant death.)After skilling 8 points, I purposely went to the underworld to grab me some Gargoyle crafting parts. Success! I traversed the small dungeon and come out with enough items to craft armor...Oh Sheets! I just learned that the Gargoyle armor is Plate and...well...we all know archers do not wear plate ordinarily.The ruleset here in Hero's Song seems to follow traditional WOTC DnD (Wizards of The Coast Dungeons and Dragons). The game is nostalgic and brings to mind some find memories of a simplier time. Even with all the Alpha issues, I find myself chosing this first to spend time with.(Edited)The most basic part of an RPG is adventuring. Being able to wander more than 100 yards from a town is where I want to be a week from now...perhaps a month.(End of Edit)(Edited)For those more adventurous and equipped to handle unknown...collect resources, build fires, wander-off and explore the mega-world.Thank you PM for making a cool game that should transcend genre.(End of Edit)Sometimes we only get one chance...This is your chance Pixelmage, make it happen!Thank you."

It is a great game no doubt about it! It's just very boring currently because the maps and tiles are HUGE, even the smallest size and that makes it difficult to find event markers like dungeons and cities inside any given tile of the entire map. Not a lot to do other than kill monsters, die, create new character and repeat. Finding items and item drops are incredibly rare and overall the game has some bugs. Losing inventory items on log out and back in, map not loading, Craftable items not showing in inventory but usable in crafting on log out and back in.Pros:FunLooks GoodVariety of races and classesLarge mapsCons:Large maps - Long time to travel between locations with combination of large tilesLarge Tiles - Making it hard to find event markers like dungeonsNot a lot to do: Create Character, Kill monsters, Die by stupid jerk wasp, try to survive underworld, die by gargoyle, repeatBugs: Inventory not loading, map not loading, sprites reacting funny in close prox(Light flicker on torch gets crazy), Prices don't show on item until after you've sold it, Townspeople tell you to rest at inn.No Inn.

We all get that, and yes buying the game is showing the developer support, etc, etc, but I honestly can not in the right mind give this game a positive review. Regardless of whether or not the games in early access or closed beta.For starters, it scares me a bit when companies releases something in this state with the concepts running now. Did they actually play or test the game themselves before they decided to put it on early access? I don't even know because with how Hero's Song is built right now...it's not even worth $5 let alone the $20 they're asking.Firstly, the world. Yes, it's massive and unique based on the size and prominence of the gods you choose. Every world is different. That's great, but doesn't make a difference in fact, because the worlds are ALL EMPTY. You're playing a walking simulator 95% of the time. Mobs are few and in between, not to mention the lack of variety in encounters and things to do.Don't get me started on the point and click to move and attack. Hard to do vs running mobs most of the time, especially when they're under a tree. They're not outlined/highlighted, so they literally become a blind click click fiasco. Back on point with the world.The map is a joke, you can walk for 20-30 minutes on a ""dungeon"" or ""town"" tile and never find the damn thing because well...the map scale is ridiculous. Coordinates just got patched...but the cords dont update, and you can't click and check the cords of the location tiles either, so...yeah, uselss atm. Nice attempt, but no good.Speaking of the mobs, the ones you encounter are easily 1-2 shot=dead. That or they kill you easily (if they're not chickens and rabbits). There seems to be no formula for balance in terms of the scaling of monsters. One minute you're fighting e.z.p.z mobs level one, then you walk into a levl 28 mob and boom! You're dead. Upgrades are few and in between in terms of gear, and armor upgrades seem to do nothing in mitigation. You'd die just as easily in cloth armor or plate armor vs the same mob.They made the world builder great, but the characters have no customization either. Only bare bones like name, race, class, and sex. That's it. Most classes aren't in yet, that's fine, and the ones in are missing passives and skills seem very limited as well. Did I mention you can't delete characters or worlds? Yeah....who thought that wasn't something to put in?Crafting is e.z as well, but again..walking around for 2 hours to gather mats on the floor or off of mobs, in a 95% empty world, is no fun. Did I mention it's a walking simulator? Ok, I did? Good. Then you go log off, and come back tomorrow to realize none of your progress or chacter was saved...which is fine. No big deal, it's early access, bugs are to be expected. That I know, but terrible design and gameplay choices shouldn't be excusable because its' ""EARLY ACCESS"".Take a lesson from Rimworld, who's in early access, which is basically 10x more thought out than what Hero's Song is right now. I think I could write a novel on what's wrong with the game...so lets quit while I'm ahead."

I totaly like the way they go to pixel-art direction.- Gameplay (Overall):Good temp and animation for the hits and speed of the game overall, not stupid AI.CONS:- No content at all, you can view all content in less then 2 hours.- Bugs, yes it's Early Access, but note that game is in pre Alpha build.Coz i can't explain reason why i kill critter and get +10 EXP and when i kill 23 level more then me Orc and get same +10 EXP and they are aggressive and spawn in packs, hard to kill on early stages. Nothing to metion on sidewalk from the clifs, it can be feature, but now it looks like a bug.- NPC, well for now they are nothing to do in the world. Coz when i see NPC i kill it, due to there is no profit of it's exostance, there is no punishment for killing it, there is even profit in killing NPC coz you get high EXP and Bread+Water can be sold at very high value.- Mapping (Cities/Dungeons/Points of Interest).Got spawned in the middle of 9 Dungeons, how do you think how many i fould of them, correct 0. Wasted 2 hours of running in different directions and didn't find any of them. Such a downside of the game that makes you just don't want to play.- Crafting.Oh boy, why would you have able to craft Swords and unable to craft all other types of wepons like Maces, Spears, e.t.c.Is it hard to copy recipe and change a result for it ? I want use crafted mace not Sword,- Loot.Most of loot is useless. You don't need to craft any food or gather ingradients, just kill orcs, they drop both drinks and food that has stacking bonus to STR (HP Increase), how many bonuses you can get at the time ? Well i managed to do 12 buffs, could be more.- Balance.Game stops being challenging on the level 2. Correct, i played Paladin. You level up to 2. Get ""Lay On Hands"" and that's it. With ""Lay On Hands"" i haven't seen any enemy that could kill me unless i want to go to ""Underworld"", speaking of it got only one time spawn, so it's a just one time killing mobs and then you can just walk through all the time, just walk through the maze and you alive. So you are immortal. So yes, going further with my Paladin i got some rediculous equips/skills.Level 3: get 5-6 Pick Axes, go to Mountain region, dig Gold, make Gold Sword/Shield. That's it, this is end of the game right on the spot.Level 2: you deal 14-16 Damage.Level 3: you deal 400-500 Damage.Getting past level 6 revards you with a [Divine] type damage skill, it's a Ranged, Mass AOE skill with small cooldown, it's damage got multiplied by the damage of your weapon and Passive perk that makes you deal even more damage with [Divine] type. Another ranged skill is ""Hummer"" that deals 2 hits [Smash]+[Divine] and Paladin got another Passive that benefits to [Smash] type of damage. So it's your main source of single target damage that deals tramandous amount of damage.From other side all other not Warrior/Swashbucker classes. I die alot no matter what i do i die alot. As a Ranger, you need arrows to do damage, damage is weak, you are unable to craft Golden Bow or get any bow with more that 9-13 damage value. BeastMaster, good melee skill with one point max, can tame wild animals it's good, but why when you tame it it doesn't adjust to your level, doesn't benefit from your stats, it's just temporary effect also. Tame = animal will be your companion, untill it dies, well i used to this kind of behaviour. Magic, great this is actually damage provider, there is no in game resistance to magic unless you are 10+ Monk that have passives for magic res. Any caster will deal good amount of damage. But paladin is a all kinds class, Plate, Ranged AOE magic attack and it got Heal and good AOE mele attack. Why would you like to play other classes, when you got all this ?Why would you like to suffer as a Physical Ranged class ?Current game doesn't worth of 12$+ it must cost 1$ or less. Coz for example you can buy ""Binding of Issacs"", original not rebirth for 0.75$ and it is a great game, better then this Test Build made with 3 people in a week term. Not the graphics, but code base. Comon Smadley is it all you can show us ?"

Out of fifty fights he only actually engaged in combat in like three of them.The game feels like a very very very early alpha build. I understand it's EA, but it definitely shouldn't have been released yet. After twenty minutes you will be bored due to lack of content.Also some of the ""features"" are just poorly executed. The world map is grid based, but each ""square"" in the grid has no map of its own and is rather large because of how zoomed in the camera is in the game. It would take probably 20-25 minutes to FULLY explore one square on the grid. The map shows icons where dungeons and events are, but once you get to that ""square"" there is no indication of where that dungeon or event was. I spent 20 minutes looking for an event, pretty sure I scoured the entire square, and found nothing.I see the potential, but right now it's just not fun.

This game was supposed to be based around the Gods and Pantheon shaping the world.  Well - on a literal sense, they do shape the world, but the Pantheons are nothing more than world generation sliders masked as something inovative.For having such a large and talented team considering the scope of the project, the lack of progress is concerning.  This is a shell of a game, and even by early access standards, it isn't looking good.  You'll maybe run around for 30 minutes before you start asking yourself, ""What is the point?"".
