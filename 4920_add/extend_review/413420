But it has a few problems that DR1 didn't have, which to me was what made the game fun in the first place.DR1 spoilers:All of them seem capable of killing which I couldn't say about the first game where it was obvious that weedman, the giant and donut girl wasn't a threat to you.DR2 spoilers:However unlike the first game where Kirigiri, Byakuya and other characters were arguing during the trial and bringing up interesting points. DR2 has a lack of persuasive characters. There's effectively just Nagito (who argues in your favor half the time anyway) and Chiaki. The other characters never challenges you in a convincing way."

The farthest I got in this game was the 4th chapter which I didn't even finish since I lost my save files but I think that 20+ hours (I played an illegal copy and decided to buy the game on steam when it was on sale) playing this are enough to give my opinion about this masterpiece.Yet simple, the visuals are stunning, the theater feeling you get from the scenes is pretty cool and the music that comes with it just makes the perfect mix, the cast is lovely (Just avoid getting to close to one of them as he/she will probably die lol) and is full of waifu material. The class trials are satisfying as hell to solve and the references in this game are EVERYWHERE.Anyway, buy this video game, it's ♥♥♥♥ing amazing."

Go ahead I'll wait, I'm a patient man. This review isn't for you, it's for those who have played the previous game. I will now explain why this game is better than its' predecessor.PROS+ Gundam Tanaka.+ The writing in this is just sublime. Some real gut wrenching moments.+ Nagito+ Good music+ The visuals just look - I don't know - sharper? Maybe it's because the previous game was set in a dully-coloured highschool and this is based on the great big outdoors but it just looks.. crisp, brighter; overall.+ Did I mention the characters (see previous pros) They are just as much a bunch of fancinating freaks as much as the first game, even more so perhaps.CONS- (for completionists) The Monomi and pet mini-games drag on in the later stages of the game and become quite a grindy-chore."

,Recommended,413420,30708582,Posted: 24 March,all,Alien Rope Burn,"Sometimes more is less.Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair has the unfortunate job of having to say ""How do I follow up that?"" The original Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, had final relevations that would, without spoiling, make further installments tricky. Danganronpa 2, therefore, sidesteps the larger narrative already set up to tell a smaller but still engaging story. This one isn't really a standalone - though you can probably go through it without playing Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, I would urge anybody interested to play the original first. While for the most part this stands alone, the parts that don't are pretty vital.So, D2: GD keeps with the blend of visual novel text and minigames established in the original. There still isn't any signficant branching other than what students you choose to bond with during a given playthrough, though there's seemingly a hidden scene or two I may have missed, looking at the gallery. Instead, it relies more on the murder mysteries and minigames to engage, and those felt relatively strong, though one case left me rather cold. In general, those who have played D:THH will feel at home again. The core gameplay of ""meet friends, watch them die, solve the mystery"" remains the same, but there are a more few new distractions.In keeping with sequelitis, some of the minigames have been changed and a new one has been added, but sometimes not for the better. The core debate mechanics are still strong and remain the core. A new debate style where you ""cut"" words is a middling addition - it's difficulty seemed to wander wildly to the point I felt one sequence was nearly impossible on Hard, but thankfully only nearly so. Hangman's Bluff gets a unnecessarily obtuse addition of moving letters that can crash into each other, which I just felt was distraction. A new minigame, Logic Dive, has you hoverboarding down the tube of... your mind?... and selecting different conclusions by boarding down different paths. To me, it felt like an unnecessarily reflex-and-memorization version of Ace Attorney Investigations' logic mechanic. Ultimately, though, they still fulfill their purpose of adding tension to the trial segments and breaking up what otherwise would probably be a tiring wall of text. Mystery deduction remains engaging for the most part, with only one mystery that had me squinting at how the player was supposed to puzzle a thing or two out.Also new to the series are leveling and a virtual pet mechanic, which is easily the worst new addition. You can warp between locations quickly, or you can walk slowly from area to area on the new island environment. Walking levels your character, but also there's a virtual pet you get you can grow by walking as well. However, your virtual pet will♥♥♥♥♥♥itself to death if left unattended, so you have to enter a menu, select the pet option, and occassionally press ""X"" to clean its♥♥♥♥♥♥up and allow it to grow. Leveling can be done other ways as well, mind. Your level controls how many skills (gained by making bonds with others, still) you can equip for trails, and the pet can be given gifts to raise its ""hope"" to get it to evolve into different forms. It's all a bunch of fiddly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to reward people willing to play a Desert Bus-quality minigame that hopefully won't make a return, because it's real, real bad. The pets don't do anything interesting but shower your in monocoins, which are used once again to buy gifts to make bonds with the other students and unlock stuff in the gallery.If that wasn't all, there's a fairly average arcade ""magical girl"" side-game to play, as well as a alternate story mode and novella that are unlocked upon finishing the game - I've played the former but not the two latter games yet.As an aside, just get guides for gift-giving or pet raising in that regard. It's not worth sussing out on your own. Similarly, the random gacha machine tries to trick you into spending more than on monocoin at a time, but it's only worth it if you're buried in them and you're down to that last 10% or 5% of items to unlock. It retains the bad mechanic of just throwing in tens or hundreds of coins one at a time to get the best result.This may sound all really harsh, but I still enjoyed it. And it's hard to talk about why, because the biggest elements of D2:GD are the relationships, reveals, and a deeply Japanese sense of humor and wit. If you've played D:THH - which you once again should have before playing this - you should already have a pretty good idea of what you're in for. The new characters are generally interesting and entertaining with only a few misses, and I wouldn't mind another go-round to see more once I have the time. It's unfortunate to have some of the albatross-like mechanics added to what otherwise is a fairly strong narrative, though hemmed somewhat by the relevations of the original. There are some handwavey portions that disappointed me somewhat, but overall it left me wanting to poke some more through the bizarre pile of questionable quality that is what the Danganronpa *transmedia franchise* at this point. Is it good? Hmmm. Is it fun? I think it's pretty fun so far.Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair remains a relatively clever visual novel with just enough spice of minigame and adventure game crossbreeding to keep me entertained, A lot of whether people like this depends on your tolerance for visual novels, Japanese quirk, and some degree of monkeycheese, but it's not the sort of experience you'll get much of anywhere else save perhaps the Phoenix Wright games, and those games aren't on Steam.Played through with both difficulties on hard. Had to resort to a guide once to get an answer and once to get a clue that led me to the answer. Leveled to 99, god help me, and pretty sure I raised all the pets but the pet achievement never triggered. Finished the magical girl minigame. Bonded with 3 other students to maximum.TL;DR: Easily worth your time for the narrative if you enjoyed the original, but it's not without some annoyances to put up with, so if you're easily bugged by some garbo mechanics or time-wasting elements it may not be for you. If you haven't played the original, don't play this."

It's absolutely awesome and a great sequel to the previous game.Pro'sThe story is awesome. Every time you think you've seen it all, it just goes more crazy.Character design is diverse and they have their own backstories which are surprisingly rich in detail.It's not just all talking (endless dialogue is something I dislike in visual novels). There's a variety of mandatory minigames, and investigations & ""class trials"" are always a nice change of pace at the right time.Character dialogue is mostly voiced; not everything is spoken but often the essence of what they're saying is being said out loud, really adding in to the atmosphereTotally crazy, but nice soundtrackConsThe ending was a bit more confusing this time around than in the previous one.The graphics aren't something you would expect from a game in this day and age. I don't think they're bad, but I can definitely imagine people dislike the graphics.The characters sometimes did resemble the players from the old game a lot. For example an ultimate gymnast and an ultimate martial artist, and an ultimate gamer & ultimate programmer in the previous game. But it's not like what happens is a copy or anything so that's fine :)If you've played the previous one, this is basically a continuation of that game. So if you've liked that, definitely pick it up. I wouldn't recommend it to people that haven't played the first part. But this game is a series that's worth playing as the storyline is amazing!Was this review useful to you?Please also check out the Izzy Reviews Curator pagefor regular updates on reviews for other games!"

I obsessively played the first, totally enthralled by the intricate story, the fantastic writing, and the neon-edged psychopunk visuals... then nearly bought a Vita just so I could play the sequel.  I had to know what happened next!Positives:-  The writing.  Oh God, the writing is totally spot on.  Full of strangely translated Japanese-isms, chock full of memorable characters, and truly intricate mysteries, what else do you really need?-  The art style is insane.  Anime/Manga stylings crossbred with 80s retrowave neon, topped off with a heady froth of island beauty.  Never has such an idyllic setting been host to such nefarious deeds.-  Voice Acting.  Not all of the dialogue is spoken, but the stuff that is is brilliant.  Even the random punctuating exclamations are pretty funny in their own right.-  Nekomaru.  Big muscle dude wearing his coach's whistle on a big♥♥♥♥♥chain around his neck, willing to give anyone deep tissue massages?  Pinch me.-  The adult-oriented nature of it all.  Going from Phoenix Wright to this was like jumping in the deep end of a freezing swimming pool.  Here's to hoping there's more Nekomaru oriented fanservice.  }:DNegatives:-  If you minimize the game for any length of time, it freezes up.-  No autosave, so you have to remember to make periodic save stops... lest a minimized freeze-up eats up 2 hours of gameplay.  (Speaking from personal experience, in both games.)-  The next Danganronpa game isn't due out in the US for quite some time.  I may have to take up a hobby, like shuttlecock."
,Recommended,413420,22803345,"Posted: 4 May, 2016",all,Jessagon,"TL;DR - If this game is on sale and you've played and enjoyed the first Danganronpa (Trigger Happy Havoc), this game is 100% worth the money.  An instant buy if on sale, and still completely worth it at full price.Long version below.-----<< Non-Spoiler Review >>-----For those interested in buying, I'm going to try to keep this as SPOILER FREE as possible.First of all, this game can be played without any prior Danganronpa knowledge but it is HIGHLY recommended you play the first Danganronpa entry before purchasing/playing DR2.--<< WHAT IS IT >>--The gameplay and premise in Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is the similar it it's predecessor, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc.  If this is the first Danganronpa entry that you're going to play, then Danganronpa plays like a regular visual novel, but with mini-games and collectibles.  If you don't know what a visual novel is well it's technically like a book.What makes Dangonronpa 2: Goodbye Despair different than any other visual novel?  Well it's not about finding your favourite waifu and giving them presents (okay there is some of it, but it's not the main point!) but rather it is a darker toned, muder-mystery type visual novel.  Sort of like a weird, zany, mix of Phoenix Wright and Zero Escape.--<< PREMISE >>--As I said above the premise is similar to the first game.  You play as a rather normal looking male highschooler hoping to attend one of the worlds most prestigious school, the inspiring and incredible Hope's Peak Academy.  But before you long, you realize you've actually been thrown into some sick, battle royale-esque, life or death game with other extremely talented and goofy students.The only way to escape this terrifying game is to MURDER another student and get away with it.  After a certain amount of time after a bodies discovery, a class trial will be held.  At this point you and the other students must discover the 'Blackened' (in other words the killer) and vote him/her as the culprit.  If you're wrong, well then.. everyone get's executed and the Blackened will escape the game!P.S - There is a lot of death in this game.--<< GAMEPLAY >>--Now that you get a gist of the premise and what type of game it is, now let's go over the general gameplay.For the most part, the game is a regular visual novel.  There are lots of text and lots to read.  The game is usually broken into segments of:Free TimeInvestigationsClass TrialsFree Time is when you're allowed to do, well, whatever you want.  You can travel around and speak with the other students and learn more about them and you know, give your waifus presents and good stuff like that.Investigations are moments in the story where you are given an amount of time to go around investigate and gather clues before the Class Trials begin.Last but not least, the Class Trials are where your wits will be put to the test.  A lot of the minigames require you to logically point out/agree with mistakes in your classmates testimonies, and this part of the game is rather intense.   There are a lot of mini-games and they're rather difficult to explain so I'm not going to, but they vary from intense jeopardy type games to slicing words across the screen with a blade and then countering to rythmn mini-games.There are also up to 3 different difficulty settings if you just want to casually enjoy the game or want to challenge yourself (and the game is challenging).There is a sort of world map like hub where you get to walk around and travel to where you want to go.  After entering you can move a first-person camera around to click and investigate on certain objects.  There are also some first person dungeon-like maps where you can physically walk around and look at stuff but these are a bit more rare.If we compare the game to Danganronpa 1, it improves on this point in almost every aspect (I'm looking at you Hangman's Gambit mini-game.. -shudders-).--<< MUSIC >>--It's good.  Certain themes are quite memorable.DUAL AUDIO ! (Yayy!  JP VOICES!)--<< CHARACTERS >>--If not for the f**king insane story and cases you're going to have to solve, pick it up for the incredible and lovable cast of characters.Danganronpa is a type of game where, well, you're never going to be sure who's going to survive to the end.  But because of the Dating Sim-like Free Time segments, there are some characters that you're going to really grow attached to.  Which is a good thing in most games.  But in this game, where you're never sure who's going to get the axe next.. It's a pretty scary feeling.It's also what makes Danganronpa games so fun in general.  There's something about picking out your favourite characters at the very beginning, getting to know them, and praying to god that they make it through this ordeal with you.It's nothing like watching the cast of characters dwindle down, only to see a handful remain, growing to trust them, only to tragically realize another body has been found.It's rather heartbreaking.I also enjoyed these characters more than the ones in the first game, but that's probably preference.  By the end of the first game I was probably only attached to 2 of the suvivors, but by the end of DR2 I was heartbroken, and attached to everyone that made it through.--<< STORY >>--Don't want to go into detail here.  There are a huge amount of references to the first game which make this game much better to play.  But you can definitely jump into DR2 without playing the first one.But to sum it up, the story is amazing.--<< CONCLUSION >>--If you're a fan of Phoenix Wright, Zero Escape, or Visual Novels and are looking for something new, buy DR1 THEN buy this game.   It's challenging, decently long from 20-30 hours depending on how you pace yourself, with an INCREDIBLE story that only builds upon everything that was great from DR1 and makes it even better in DR2.It's completely worth the cash.  Every cent of it.  Easilly one of the best games I've played in the last few years and I cannot wait for Danganronpa V3 to come out on the PS4/VITA."

,Recommended,413420,22786280,"Posted: 3 May, 2016",all,ZXNova,"So I completed Dangan Ronpa 2 a few days ago. I also played through Island Mode as well. I have a lot I wanna say, but it'll take some time to gather my thoughts.==WARNING FULL GAME SPOILERS==Dangan Ronpa 2 is a good game. I liked it a lot. I really got into the story, the characters among other things. Though I think I'll start off with some issues I had with the games.Case 3 - The murder weapon that was used to kill Saionji was never found or even searched for. Having played Ace Attorney before, I know that in the (not exactly) words of Phoenix Wright ""Evidence like that would never be overlooked"". Apparently the reason why this was the case (according to the DR Wiki) is because the developers had originally intended for Kuzuryu to be killed during Case 3 rather than Saionji, however they decided to repeal this decision because ""Peko's sacrifice would have been for nothing""... Honestly, wouldn't her sacrifice being all for nothing have been the more despairing? It ended up causing an issue with Case 3 that bothered me a lot besides Mikan being the killer :/ A friend of mine were discussing Case 3, and he believed that Case 3 would have been better if it was just Ibuki getting killed.The Island Mode... I wish there was more attention to detail in it. Their only excuse was ""it's an extra mode anyway"", comon now, you could have the extra mode have more... extra in it. At least the endings in Island Mode were very satisfying for me. Island Mode is a fun mode at first, but I can see it getting a bit boring after you gained everyone's hope fragments and are just trying to get everyone's ending. After getting everyone's ending in Island, I can say confidently that I felt very happy.Monomi mode is pretty interesting. The keyboard controls suck, and I'm only able to use my controller by using JoytoKey.Every murder in this game was very tragic. Either because of the murdered or the murderer. Teruteru was trying to kill Nagito to protect (Faker) Byakuya, but ended up killing him instead. Peko was trying her best to protect Kuzuryu and ended up being sacrificed in the end and with her loved one nearly dying too. Mikan is the one person you would have ever expected to commit murder. However, some stupid despair disease made her do it... I'll speak on this later. Nekomaru and Gundham fought it out, a ""mutual killing"" for the sake of their friends. Nagito, as twisted as he was, was trying to get rid of all despair, and he was inadvertently helping AI Junko.Speaking of which, finding out that every classmate in DR2 was an Ultimate Despair was really surprising... Can you really imagine Nekomaru being an ultimate despair? I know I sure can't.This ending isn't ""as"" despairing as DR1 in a way, but thinking about DR1 makes it more despairing. It makes you realize that everyone who died in DR1, is actually dead. No hope of ever coming back. This wasn't a dream. Celes, Ogami, Chihiro, Ishimaru, Mondo, Yamada, and everyone else is just dead. At least DR2 is kind of a dream. At least your friends are comatose. However, you could also say that's worse than death. Also, according to the wiki, because Mikan and Nagito had died knowing that the world they were in was all just a game, they have a higher chance of waking up than everyone else. DR2's ending really left me in between hope and despair.Picking up where I left off about Case 3, I really felt cheated about that one. Despair Disease? Really? Why didn't AI Junko ever use that again huh? Had everyone killed off. Despair Disease just felt like a crappy plot point to get an unlikely character to be a murderer. (My favorite DR character from each game just so happened to be the murderer in CASE 3). However, thinking on it I can also see its purpose. To give you a taste of how everyone once was. Everyone in this class except Chiaki was an ultimate despair. Even the most unlikely like Mikan had an evil and despicable personality in their past. This is why they're using the Neo World Program to restore hope. So they could change.However, after some thinking on it, I realize that the despair disease itself wasn't bad, it was how it was executed. Using despair disease to ""force"" a motive on someone is just really bad. It was nice with Akane, Ibuki, and Nagito just having the despair disease. If the Case 3 murder were just left off with Ibuki being killed, it would have been an even more interesting case, but no, they needed an extra person to die to parallel to DR1 case 3.As for characters, I don't feel like going into it. My favorites were Mikan, Chiaki, Nekomaru, and Gundham. I will admit that Nagito is very well written, but he's a golden turd, ya know. Kuzuryu was also pretty good, and knowing that Kuzuryu was originally intended to die in Case 3 makes me kinda wish, or well, want to see how things would have went if it went the way it was originally intended to be. With Saionji being a survivor instead of Kuzuryu. (Pick your Loli Shota). Saionji is an annoying foulmouthed brat but... she grew on me. I kinda like her. Frankly, I don't feel any guilt in it.Other than that, the story was fantastic. I had many feels. ""The Day Before the Future"" made me cry. Soundtrack in general is pretty good. Kill Command was a great track during case 5.But yeah, good game."

,Recommended,413420,23333242,"Posted: 1 June, 2016",all,Suavek,"There isn't much point in describing what Danganronpa 2 is if you haven't played the first one. In short, it's a linear story-heavy visual novel with grotesque and adult theme and ""puzzle"" elements in the form of Phoenix Wright style trials. If that's your thing, then go play, or read about the first game. If it's not, then at the very least do the latter, because the series is quite unique in nearly every aspect and may convince you anyway.When it comes to Danganronpa 2 I can safely say it's a really good sequel. The story features new characters and setting, the gameplay has been improved, new features have been added, and the music and visuals are just as good and unique as last time. It's a great game that surely all fans of the previous one will appreciate.BUT... that said, it is difficult to avoid comparisons to the previous game, and as such my opinion will probably sound a bit negative. I hear many people consider the sequel to be better. Sadly, I don't agree. Story-wise, it's kind of a similar killing-game with a deeper mystery, just in a different setting. As much as I was engaged and surprised by numerous ""twists"", there were a lot of really silly, or just idioitc moments, especially by the end. Same goes for characters, which I don't consider as charismatic as the ones from the previous game. Most of them are just irritating and rarely there's anything redeeming about them. They feature one or two personality traits for the entire game (unless they die, that is) and that's it, which is sad, especially when a single joke is being run into the ground repeatedly for hours. Of course there are exceptions, but that's what they are. Personally, I didn't really care for the majority of characters, while the overall story didn't leave as much of an impression as the first game. But as I've said - that's in comparison, because as a whole it's still quite good and engaging, with a lot of nice twists.As for the gameplay, one should appreciate how the developers tried to improve on the existing features and add some new ones. Some of these changes work, others not so much. I really enjoyed the fact that you can agree with a character's statement, instead of just pointing out holes and mistakes constantly. At the same time I hated the new Rebuttal Showdown mechanic, which is just a button masher. And being time-limited it makes it hard to focus on what the character is saying. I also didn't really see the point of Logic Drive. Although answering questions in such way is quite clever, it also tends to drag on unnecessarily later on.My biggest issue with the game I think is the fact that many answers or statements you have to shoot at are very arbitrary and not always logical. With more than six Truth Bullets available during Non-Stop Debates picking the right combination often comes down to luck or trial and error. I didn't have such issues with the previous game, while this time even though I knew what the issue was, finding the right way for the character to point it out was problematic more often than not.You could say I'm nitpicking, but I just think the game could have been much better in some areas. As it stands, it's still great, but just not as great as the first one. At least in my opinion. That said, if you enjoyed the first game, there's really not much reason in not playing the second one."

In the last one I only said that the game's freaking good - which is true, but probably wouldn't convince anyone to actually play it. So yup, making a new one.So, why is Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair so good? If you've played the first one, you already know what the game is like. Investigation. Friendship. Murder. Yup, pretty much all that repeats in DR2. And yet, this one is even better than the first. The characters are so unique here. Your (Hajime's) interactions with them and their interactions with each other are so meaningful, and everything is just so real. When one of them dies, you kind of feel like a part of you have died too. You really are able to form abondwith all of them.IIIIf amazing & unique characters aren't enough for you, well, I must also say that the cases are REALLY interesting and full of amazing plot twists in DR2. Even when you think you know what's going on, even when you think you know everything that is going to happen, BOOOOM PLOTWIST! Sometimes, the character you love the most will be the killer - Sometimes they will be the victim. That's just how it is here.I need to mention that the soundtrack is aaaaamaaaaaazing as well. It can change the mood completely. The characters' voice fit their personalities perfectly, too. There are some memorable laughs (Komaeda <3 Mikan <3) and speeches that are sure to stay in your head.Damn, this game is awesome. It's worth every penny. Tbh I kind of want to erase my memories of it so I can play it again and again and again and again and get surprised over and over and over again.Anyway.

For those who already played danganronpa 1, let's start by saying what is worse because that list is much shorter.-->We start with the ambiance of danganronpa 2, which is different than the first game. The game feels much more open because of the size and the way you move between places and islands, that doesn't mean it's worse, but you feel much less claustrophobic which in my opinion is worse because of the nature of the game.-->The second aspect of the game which is, again, subjectively worse than the first one is the balance of the characters personalities. the characters are just as good or even better than the first game, but the balancing is off in terms of seriousness, that means the cast become much more silly or serious ( not gonna spoil) and doesnt achiev the same cool balance of the first game.With that out of the way, we can go to the pros. The game is absolutely fantastic, you can feel improvments in almost every aspect of the game execpt maybe the tutorials for the minigames of the class trials. The story manages to also impact the story of the first game in a very positive way, shedding light in a lot of elements that the first story left pushed aside. The game immediatly throws you 2 very mysterious characters, that forces you to think about the characters in the first game, and with that you are left with not even knowing if the events of the second game are after or before the events of the first game at the start. This time, in a tropical island, you are going to feel much more connected with the characters because of the better balancing between the plot and the social events, you will feel even more part of the group, and, therefore, feel much more despair as things go ugly. The class trials are better in a lot of ways, the main aspect is the difficulty. The game feels like it knows you played a full game already and its much less kind with the difficulty, making the trials much more challenging in a good way. The minigames are, imo, better but still it's subjective, aside from that, the trial shows quality of life improvments, only the tutorials are bad.TLDR: the game is better in almost all aspects but the ambiance is less claustrophobic and the cast has problems with the personalities balancing throughout the story. Overall, the game is a must have for who played danganronpa 1 for sure, and the majority will probably like the second game even more."

Most of the mini games and features that were slowly introduced throughout the first game (white lines, multiple bullets, hangmans gambit, etc.) are present in the first trial and some new ones are introduced.If you liked the first game there's no good reason not the play Danganronpa 2And if you like twists get your M.NightShyamalan.jpg ready because you're going to need it."

Logic dive is by far my favourite new feature in class trials. It's a really fun minigame that's vaguely reminiscent of SSX and Wipeout combined.The voice acting is marvelous and if you're a big enough weeb, you're probably going to hear some people you recognise.My only real complaint is that they call the hangman's gambit ""improved"" when actually I think they kinda mangled it compared to the DGR1 version.

,Recommended,413420,32994990,Posted: 29 June,all,jade,"in my mind, this game is not a sequel to danganronpa 1. danganronpa 1 is the prequel to this game. the gameplay in super danganronpa 2 is so much smoother, and added features, such as the fact that NPCs can rebuke your statements and trigger a new minigame, make for a far more intriguing trial overall. the characters in SDR2 have been regarded as less realistic than those in DR1 by some, which i can understand, but they're just as lovable as those from the first game, if not more so. this game also adds backstory and context that DR1 couldn't incorporate, such as the (endgame spoilers)NWP, and the like-SAO-but-better ""ingame death = brain failure"" concept. it definitely surpasses DR1 in my eyes--not that DR1 was bad, but compared to SDR2 it definitely seems like a prequel for the sake of a prequel. overall, i definitely recommend this game and am completely satisfied with knowing i spent my money well. there's a reason they call it ""superdanganronpa"", and to me it's clear as day."

,Recommended,413420,22750732,"Posted: 1 May, 2016",all,fleur,"Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is the official sequel to 2010's hit release of Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, available at long last on PC. Its premise is the same as the first - a large group of quirky characters find themselves robbed of their memories and stranded in a closed environment, with the only possibility of escape coming as a reward should they manage to commit a murder and escape identification as the culprit by their peers in the subsequent class trial. When this happens, they are allowed to go free while everyone else is executed, while if they fail, they themselves will be executed while everyone else gets to keep on living.It is no exaggeration to say that I absolutely adore nearly everything about this game. The story is composed of (as you'd expect) a series of murder mysteries that take place within a greater overarching narrative wherein the protagonists try to plumb the mysteries of why they're being confined and forced to murder each other, as well as the events that lead them to their current circumstances. The characters are a good mix of anime tropes and actual development, and for the most part come off as very sympathetic and believable in their motivations, given the context and genre. Unlike other VNs, there's no branching routes or choices to be made in the main game, for the most part, and the story is entirely linear. There's a few parts that I felt werea bittoo fanservicey (and I don't mean the ones where the resident whimpering dojikko keeps tripping herself into ever more compromising and risque positions) but overall, the writing is excellent, hitting all the emotional beats and following a logical progression even when it appears to be devolving into complete and utter nonsense. Unfortunately, DangitRonpaul 2 continues the tradition started by 1, in that the best girl dies far too early on, but thankfully so does the worst, so I guess I can't really complain in the long run.The actual gameplay consists of two parts - exploration, which consists of a looping side-scrolling section you use to navigate the game's islands, static scenes that resemble pop-up books where you interact with things and people using your cursor, and first person sections that you use to explore certain specific environments. The other major part is the investigation and trial section, where all of the actual meat of the gameplay is - you examine locations and talk to people in order to gather clues, and then deploy these clues in a trial setting in order to determine the culprit. Sometimes this takes the form of straight-up questions, sometimes you're asked to pick a relevant piece of evidence for a particular problem from your entire big list, and sometimes you have to play an infuriating minigame in order to accomplish the same thing as the latter two options, but most often you'll be going around a circle listening to everyone make propositions about what happened, and either calling out inconsistencies by shooting their words with the damning piece of evidence or backing them up using the same process. At other times, your peers will call you out themselves, prompting a verbal duel where you use the analog stick to slice apart their arguments in preparation for a final devastating rejoinder. I played on mean difficulty for both logic and action for all but the final chapter (where I set the action difficulty down a notch to kind) and I found the trials fair and for the most part fun. The order of events makes sense, and there's only a few instances which required significant leaps of logic in order to figure out the proper way to proceed, but there's enough twists and surprises in the mysteries to keep you guessing and doubting yourself even when you're pretty sure you've solved it.You can't actually fail in either the evidence collection or the trials, of course - trying to leave a scene before you've got all the pertinent clues results in your character refusing to do so, and running out of influence (which is like HP) during a trial only reduces the reward you get at the end, and so should be entirely appropriate for products of the modern Western education system. My biggest complaint against the gameplay would be two minigames that seem entirely out of step with the theme of the game and completely unfun, and whose removal would have only served to make the game much better. The hangman's gambit game is just a very slow and often frustrating way of spelling out an obvious thing, and the snowboarding minigame is out-of-place and tacked-on, where its only relation to the events it's representing is that you sometimes answer multiple-choice questions. I honestly would have preferred just getting the multiple-choice questions alone without the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t snowboarding.In terms of presentation - which is to say art, music and voice acting, I have nothing but good things to say. I played with Japanese voices, and you can tell that they really shelled out for an A-list cast. My only complaint in that regard is that when you get KanaHana to voice your character I only hear KanaHana and not the character. The art, meanwhile, is characteristically great, and even the lo-fi lo-res pop-up book look of the game's various environments has a distinct charm to it. Some of the CGs are a little spotty in parts, great in others, but are somewhat rare overall, and, most importantly, the character sprites you'll be looking at for most of the game look great.One aspect which I felt could definitely be improved was in the localization - some of the translations felt more than a little awkward, and the script is riddled with minor but noticeable grammatical errors. Not enough to ruin the experience by any stretch of the imagination, but nonetheless enough to bug you if you're the same sort of friendless pedant as me.Beyond that, I'd say that the game is absolutely exceptional. Not only that, but it comes with a good amount of goodies, including a whole alternate route where the killing never started, which plays a bit more like a conventional school life VN, and a bonus LN by Narita Ryougo of Baccano and Durarara fame. If you were a fan of the first game, I would absolutely recommend you check this out. If you like VNs, anime, murder mysteries or good stories, I highly suggest you check out the first installment if you think it'd interest you even the slightest little bit. You're highly unlikely to be disappointed."

Simply put, I love Trigger Happy Havoc and I love this one even more. The story is so much weirder yet it offers even more intrigue and the writing is fantastic. There's an extreme level of self-awareness the original was too shy to muster but Goodbye Despair pulls off flawlessly. It takes jabs at the previous game's story as well as absurd tropes and the characters go as out of their ways as possible to defeat their stereotypes. The story is so much more unpredictable and unhinged, keeping the player constantly on edge and the murders this time around are even more interesting and crazy. The art style carries over from the original effortlessly and the music, as it was in the previous game, is fantastic. Some standout pieces are Homicide and the new intro theme. The voice acting is great and doesn't grate the ears. Gameplay is about the same as last time with the minigames having been changed up and having had some new ones added into the class trials. Most are decent, but the new Hangman's Gambit is gutter trash and obnoxious. The game is lengthy but never feels like a drag due to how quickly things unfold. If you've enjoyed the original, this is a must. Oh and there's now mid-trial saves so you can take breaks. THANK YOU SO SO MUCH!"

It is time for a review!My first one, actually ... weird ...Anyway, to simply put my upcoming statements and opinions into a simple sentence:Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is an amazing game ... but only for the group of people who would be interested in playing it.Sure Sure Sure, that sounds like the same thing you should say for any game, right? However, I find that that is very true of this particular game. This game can be very selective on who would, and wouldn't, enjoy it. I do believe that anyone can pick up, play this game, and completely enjoy everything about it, even though they don't normally like the kind of games that DR2GD (that's short for Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair) is in the same category of, but this game still isn't the perfect game that would appeal to all of the people! However, it is safe to say that if you like games with a lot of mystery and solving those mysteries (Like Ace Attorney games and whatnot) then you'll like this one mainly because that is the biggest and most defining element for this game series ... except for one of the games in the series, but you won't find that game on Steam! Yet! ... maybe  ... puhuhuhuhuhuuuuu!PREREQUISITESFirst of all, youHAVEto play the first game: Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc!It is equally amazing and sets the stage for a lot of what happens in this game. I mean, this game is theSEQUELto that game! So, go give Danganronpa 1 a shot before going into this game. If you don't like Danganronpa 1 for itsstory-telling,gameplay,overall design, or WHATEVER, then this game may not be for you. It will build off of the things that you hated in the first one, so it may be just more of what you hate.Got it? Alright! If you've played the first Danganronpa, and/or are curious about whether the game is a worthy successor to the first one and/or a good game in general and/or just kinda bored and thought you'de go on a steam-review-reading-frenzy because ... well I don't know ... you're bored or something? ... then buckle up and get ready to FEEL DESPAIR!I mean ... read the review! Yeah ... that ...STORYI am NOT going to spoil the story for DR2GD for two reasons:If I spoiled the game, why would you want to play it?IT WOULD TAKE WAY TO LONG TO SAY THE ENTIRE STORY AT CLOSE TO MIDNIGHT ON A MONDAY! I AM NOT PREPARED FOR THAT KIND OF COMMITMENT!I can, however, summarize the basic gist of the story so that you know what you are in for. If you've played the first Danganronpa game, then you know what is basically going to happen:You are boy.You wake up on strange island with a class of people you have never met before.Everything seems strange and unsettling, but soon becomes sunshine and rainbows!The future seems hopeful and the other people on the island seem nice.PSYCH!You and your friends are now apart of a horrible game where everyone is forced to try to kill eachother without getting caught by a trial run by that same group of friends.You are the main boy who plays a large role in helping to catch the killer, or the ""blackened"" as a certain stuffed-bear in the game calls them.Everything pretty much goes downhill from there.The story is kinda sad, honestly. You spend a lot of time getting to know these characters, whom you know as your friends, only to end up watching them die at the hands of the people you still feel are your friends. It really bums you out! I would feel slightly depressed from all of the stuff that happens in the game, and a lot of that depressing stuff is in the form of horrible murders that you have to investigate and then have to pin on one of your friends with evidence! However, all of this sadness plays into the bigger parts of the story, and makes the ending feel amazing to witness. In order to know how the game ends, you have to beat the game ... after you beat the first one too ... because it's all one intertwined mess ... AND I LOVE IT!GAMEPLAYThe main game is split into two styles: Daily Life and Deadly Life.Daily Life is when you can walk around the island and talk to the other students! You can use these opportunities to give them gifts that you can buy with coins that you collect fromPLAYING THE GAME! By giving characters gifts, you can become closer to them, and learn more information about them. A lot of these characters are very interesting, so I think you'll find at least one person that you'de like to get to know better! However, becoming friends with characters DOES NOT CHANGE THE OUTCOME OF THE MURDERS! You may end up becoming friends with someone who gets killed or is the killer! Your heart may be broken by this, and it sucks! You'll sometimes be trying to get to know everything about someone to get an achievment or just to know them as another character, BUT THEY'LL DIE BEFORE YOU EVEN GET THE CHANCE!Spoiler about this game mechanic:I beat the game on the hardest difficulty and was able to unlock Island Mode, which is basically just Daily Life forever, AND NOBODY DIES so you can become friends with everyone!The second part of the gameplay is the Deadly Life. Deadly Life is the investigation part that happens after a body has been discovered. You will look for clues and then participate in a class trial to find the true killer! Finding evidence involvessomewalking around, but is mostly just pointing and clicking things in rooms that pertain to the case. The class trail is a bunch of minigames that revolve around everyone trying to answer questions about the case, defend themselves, or piece together the events of the case. Most of this is also pointing and clicking, but there are sometimes word-puzzles, multiple choice questions, a platformer-decision-making minigame, and rhythm games.This game involves a lot of clicking. You will sometimes use the keyboard to get to the main menu and walk around, but most of the game is clicking.Another big part of the game is reading! Please be able to read when playing this game! ALSO BE READY TO SIT THROUGH A LOT OF DIALOGUE! If you are the kind of person who hates cutscenes and would rather play the game, ignore the urge to skip through text. THE DIALOGUE IS IMPORTANT! It conveys the story and gives clues to what the evidence means and how it can relate to the case! There are also sounds, and sometimes entire lines have voice overs for them, so be ready to hear a lot of ""hmms"" and ""HEY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥""s and ""I see ...""s and ""YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE""s during your playtime.The sounds are actually pretty good, I must say ...E V E R Y T H I N G - E L S EUhh ... listen ... this game is just good ...If you like mild horror and a lot of suspense and thrills: Play this game.If you enjoy mystery based games: Play this game.If you played the first game and loved that game to pieces: Play this game.If you got two hands and one has a plate of cookies on it and the cookies are made of $100 bills: Let me have some of those ""cookies"", buy this game, and then play this game.This is the part of my first review where I get really tired and rethink my life choices ...I might revisit this review to ""finish"" it ... but not right now ... becuase sleep ... and boredom ..."

,Recommended,413420,24193231,"Posted: 8 July, 2016",all,Kapol,"Danganronpa 2 builds on the first entry in many ways. Most of them for the better. I felt the characters were better storied and more interesting. The plot itself was more in line with what I expected of the first game, with a better story to help keep interest from waning. The trials are expanded in a few ways. Most of the changes to the trials work well enough, but I wasn't a fan of some of the 'improved' minigames. And, thanks to playing the first game, I knew not to stress maxing every relationship before beating the campaign.Overall I'd recommend it if you're into visual novels or Ace Attorney-style cases. But if you are interested in Danganronpa 2 I would highly recommend playing the original first. While I would say 2 was better, it feels like a continuation of the first from a gameplay aspect. The gameplay feels more like a 'hard mode' of the first game, and might seem more unforgiving to those new to the series. Plus you would miss out on the references and parodies of the first game.And now to wait for 3 and hope it comes out for PC as well."

76561198316843141,Recommended,413420,29247619,Posted: 14 January,all,Maebara,"Definitely a great game. I was a bit reluctant at first, but this game really is better than the first Danganronpa - even though it was also excellent. The story in itself is kind of similar to the first game, except that the killing game occurs on an island. This is so excellent that I don't even know where to start.First, this game is funny. Yes, even though there are murders, creepy murders and all.. it'll make you laugh. It's all thanks to a certain Monomi. To begin with, put japanese voices ! I don't know how english voices are like, but I can assure you that japanese voices couldn't be better than they already are. In fact, even if the entire cast but Monomi had bad voices - which is not the case, I'd still suggest you to put them. You'll probably understand what I'm talking about as you progress in the game later on.Now, let's talk about something more important. Is the plot really that good ? Well.. of course it is, but how good is it ? Like I said, Danganronpa 2 really is better than the previous game, in every aspect. I have to warn you, though. Don't play this game if you expect a """"realistic"""" story. You'd better play games where you play the role of a spiky-haired lawyer in blue suit, which fits better your expectations. Just like the first game.. I have my doubts as to whether or not the writers took some illegal drugs before writing the plot. Anyway, if it doesn't bother you, then I can assure you that you will enjoy this story, it can't be otherwise. There are so many good mysteries, murders..As for the music, they're not exceptional but still enjoyable. If you've played the first game - and you should because this game is full of spoilers - then you'll probably be happy to rediscover the ""Closing Argument"", a bit better than it already was. In fact, pretty much all sequences from the Class Trials have been improved since the last game, but the Closing Argument is by far my favorite.In conclusion, this is a must-read. Don't lose any more time and just take the plunge.And now, New Danganronpa V3 is waiting for me... :-)"

My fear was severely misplaced. Even if you know the answers or the final outcome, the mysteries in this game are more than complex enough to be perplexed by them a second time around. What surprised me the most though, was the emotion this game had to offer. Dangan Ronpa 1 was fantastic in a lot of ways, but I feel like this one was more emotional overall. In the first game, there are 2 trials in particular that are execptionally emotional to me. In this game, there are 3. It may just be one more, but as this game's 2nd, 4th, and 5th trial all made me cry like a baby...well, I think that speaks for itself. In short, buy this game. Buy it right now, or wait for a sale. It doesn't matter. Just make sure you buy it. It provides more than enough hours of play just by going through the main story once. Beyond that, there's also extra game modes to be played (like island mode, which can sometimes take just as long as the actual main story to complete 100%), achievements to be aquired, in game items to get, etc. You'll get your money's worth no matter what you pay. It's an emotional rollercoaster with some incredibly tense moments and complex mysteries. I would reccommend playing Dangan Ronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc first, as multiple references are made to it in the story, but that's also not required if you really don't want to. The one problem I have with this game is that some of the characters can fade into the background if you don't spend your free time with them, and there's never enough free time in the main story. Then again, that's the whole reason they have island mode and let you replay chapters once you've beaten them. Great game from a great series, can't wait for Dangan Ronpa 3."

It's very visual novel like, with a heavy focus on the amazing story, while being very linear. For me, that didn't matter though since I got sucked into the immersive setting right from the start - the story never gets boring and has a ton of twists, and the characters are great inthemselves, each with their own very distinct personality. Don't get too emotionally attached to your favorite waifu though, chance is high that she'll die at some point.The only minor negative point about the game for me are the unnecessarily long tutorials (especially during the class trial phase) and some of the trial minigames, as they are sometimes hard to follow and make sense of.Lastly, if you want to play this game, I'd highly recommend you  to play part 1 - Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc first, as Goodbye Despair ties closely into the overall story with lots of references and major spoilers to the first part."

I'm not a guy who usually likes to read a whole lot. Books are hard for me to pay attention to, as is reading in general. But these two games have made me push through that for a story that has left me constantly on the edge of my seat.Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair, (I still hate how they alternated that title from ""Farewell Despair Academy"", but what can you do...), has taken what made Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, and somehow amplified it even more. During the final class trial, I felt myself constantly leaned forward, paying attention to every detail I could. Even after having originally read summaries of the games, (at the time it was released only on PSP/Vita and I didn't want to pirate it), I still felt absolutely overwhelmed (in a good sense!) about how well this game manages to pull story off.I honestly cannot begin to think of anything bad on this game other than it's odd sense of perversion as compared to the first one... I mean, I'm notentirely complainingabout it, but I felt like there was a lot more perverted humour in 2 as compared to 1. I mean, for god's sake, you get the girls' panties when you max your free time interaction with them! Though I only know this from Chiaki's perspective.

This was not at all the case in Danganronpa: THH. Even under the standard difficulty, you often only got 1 bullet, maybe 3 on some of the debates.But that's what game guides are for, right?"

I even think it's better than DR1. I went into this game knowing nothing about the story, characters, ect and I loved every second of it. If you loved DR1, you'll love this. I guess this game is also pretty great as a standalone game. But, if you play this without playing DR1, you might get confused during the last chapter.Story:The story is almost the same as DR1's. You play as a boy named Hajime Hinata who gets enrolled into Hope's Peak Academy- a school for insanely talented teenagers. Soon after you get there, you and your classmates suddenly go on a ""school trip"" to a strange island. The school trip was meant to be happy and fun, but then Monokuma shows up and ruins everything. Like the first game, he makes all the students participate in a killing game where they must kill each other if they want to leave the island.Gameplay:One thing I really liked about this game is that they improved the Class Trial mini-games and made them a bit harder. In fact, the Class Trials are just harder in general. I was actually caught off guard by how hard they were. I expected them to be just as easy (or maybe a LITTLE harder) as the ones in DR1, but the first trial in this game took me 3 hours to complete because I failed... a lot.Not only that, but they also added 2 NEW mini-games called ""Rebuttal Showdown"" and ""Logic Dive"" and I think they're pretty fun- especially Logic Dive. At first I didn't like Rebuttal Showdown because I didn't understand it, but it didn't take me long to figure it out.The only bad thing about the new Class Trials is ""Improved Hangman's Gambit."" They basically just took Hangman's Gambit from DR1 and made it harder, but also made it more annoying and not fun.Characters:This game introduces a new colorful cast of characters. And honestly, I love the cast from this game more than DR1's characters. DR2's characters seem a lot more interesting. The new characters each have their own unique personalities and they all have pretty awesome character designs. The Japanese voice acting is also great! (I don't use dubs, so I can't really say if it's good or not.)Other Things:There's also a couple of new features in this game. For one: when you open your e-handbook there's now a ""Pets"" tab. Yes, you get to raise your own pet! You're supposed to give it gifts so you can raise its ""hope"" status and every once in a while you're supposed to check it and clean up its♥♥♥♥♥♥ The pet grows the more steps you take in the game. There's different pets you can raise (there's a guide on Steam that tells you how to get each pet) and if you raise it well, you'll get rewards! Most pets just give you some Monocoins and a couple of gifts but 2 of the pets will reward you with a skill that can be used in the Class Trials.Another new feature is a mini-game that can be accessed from the main menu called ""Magical Girl Monomi."" Though, I believe you can't play it right away. I think you have to progress in the main game a bit first. But anyways, in the mini-game, you play as Monomi and you basically have to fight these robot things. I've seen people complain about this game a lot. Even though I only played it to unlock the related achievements, I still enjoyed it. I thought it was pretty fun.And for those of you who have played Danganronpa 1 and are familiar with ""School Mode"", it returns in this game! Except it's called ""Island Mode"" instead. But it's basically the same exact thing. In Island Mode, Monomi wants you and your classmates to create things for her. Just like School Mode, Island Mode is an easy way to unlock the character's Free Time events so you can learn more about them.Overall:I rate this game a ♥♥♥♥ing 10/10."

I had already seen the first series of Danganronpa, so I picked this up 'cause I wanted more. I was initially turned off by the price tag, for an extremely linear game with little in the way of replay value. Safe to say, though, I got my money's worth.PROS:- Story-driven, and it delivers. There were many times I caught myself exclaiming something out loud at certain parts of the story. I seriously didn't think I'd enjoy it as much as I did.- If you're not cheating, the class trials actually do manage to pull out some difficulty, although there are times when the correct truth bullet-to-response doesn't QUITE make sense. Surprisingly (and fittingly) this game doesn't hold your hand. But you'll find class trials to be the real meat of the game, and they actually take a while to complete.- Interesting characters.CONS:- Linear, weak replay value, the game modes that aren't the main storyline are just kinda boring.- I didn't play on the hard difficulty, but in regular difficulty you practically don't need any of the skills you get from farming hope crystals or w/e they're called through building relationships between trials.NEUTRAL:- Pacing is slow at times, but this is probably intentional. The anticipation of the next exciting thing to happen will just build and build. Kind of standard anime fare.- The voice acting is good, but there's not a whole lot of it. Only during the cutscenes do we hear full dialogue rather than a canned phrase. Still, at least it's there.On the whole I recommend this to anyone looking to try something with fresh gameplay that's an emotional rollercoaster."

,Recommended,413420,35034667,Posted: 17 September,all,Potatotime5,"I'm going to write this review assuming you already played the first game.The plot of this game is that you and 15 of your classmates from Hopes Peak Academy are taken to a tropical island to get closer with each other and bond. However, the murderous Monokuma returns to host yet another killing game. This time, the stakes are that you're only allowed off the island if you murder a classmate and get away with it. The execution of this plot is done extremely well.The game is broken up into 3 different gameplay styles. These are known as Daily Life, Deadly Life, and the Class Trial. Daily Life and Deadly Life are the same as the first game, giving you time to bond with your classmates and exploring the island and giving you time to investigate the murder of your classmates respectively.The Class Trial is broken up in the same way as well, with there being novel sections that show revelations in the plot and in the murder case, and numerous mini games that lead into these novel sections. The minigames, however, are very different from the first game. The only minigames that retained its format from the first game are Bullet Time Battle (renamed to Panic Talk Action) Nonstop Debate. (Improved) Hangmans Gambit has been altered from a point and click spelling game into a matching puzzle game where you actually have to think about what you're doing. Rebuttal Showdown and Logic Dive are the new minigames introduced in Danganronpa 2. Rebuttal Showdown is a lot like nonstop debate, but instead of sitting through a series of statements from numerous different people, you slice through statements made by a single person with the WASD keys, and then you use Truth Blades to cut through contradictions within their arguments. Logic Dive is the other new minigame and is played as a runner style game where you jump over pits, and dodge blockades while answering questions to get further in the case.TL;DRStory: 9.5/10 No obvious plotholes, but some minor pacing issuesGameplay: 9/10 Gameplay is extremely fun for almost the entire game, but it has its dull moments.Music: 9.5/10 Soundtrack is superbOverall Rating: 9.5/10"

,Recommended,413420,31656139,Posted: 9 May,all,Luminous,"Tl;Dr at the bottom.God damn this game was a blast to play, gorgeous art, great soundtrack, better writing, far better ending and more importantly a lot of issues I had with the first are fixed in this... however it also creates its own set of problems which I'll talk about in a bit. Lets go in order of how I structured my review of the first game.The Good -First the art. I praised the first game for its artstyle in the sense that its a single setting but no two rooms looked alike (despite the class-rooms of course), so given a setting like multiple ISLANDS to explore you'd expect even better right? Damn right, and damn right did they deliver. Each island has a theme to follow and the express each theme beautifully. For real, this is probably one of the best anime styled games to look at out there, for its pop-up book artistic style matched with all the vibrant colours and props, every island and area was a joy to look at.The story was something I both loved and hated with the first game, and its a similar love hate relationship with this. However, the story is FAR superior to the first with only a few flaws in comparison. For starters, the writing is so much more well polished. Its not perfect, but its much more solid. Nothing feels overly stupid which the first did a lot, so thank god for that. More importantly though the ending actually felt satisfying. The big problem with the first game was not only was it poorly written but the ending felt sudden, rushed and unfinished. Even after finishing the second game we STILL don't know what truly happened after the first, some more questions have been answered sure but at the same time even more question arose. But thats the first games problems not the second. The second game did truly have a satisfying ending to the point you wouldn't mind it ending there all together. But because of Ultra Despair Girls and the Danganronpa 3 anime we know that doesn't happen.Again, the Voice acting in this game for the most part is great, you still have your irritable voices but go figure, its anime its gotta happen. However two big issues arise in this game compared to the first. Why can none of these voice actors do good crying? Every time someone cries in this game I wanna pull my hair out. This could come under the issues with writing but... the other problem I had was when a Blackend was found out, a fir portion of them had accent/personality shifts which became really dull after the second time it happened.The soundtrack again is great, there was a fair few reused tracks which is disappointing but all the original music was great.Gameplay wise... comes my biggest issues with the second game, but the positives are that exploring didn't feel like a chore anymore. The awkward first person stiff controls of the first game are still here but they aren't used nearly as much. Instead they opted for a 2D scrolling style exploration of the islands which felt much more fluid. The free-time events are still present although they felt a tad bit longer in this which kinda dragged out after having 4+ free-times in succession. This time around you also get mini objectives like finding hidden Monokuma's throughout the island... more to explain in the cons. You also get a Tamagochi style pet which after caring for it will reward you with currency and gifts for the other students and even a skill used in trials. The Trials this time around, while following the same basic format are... interesting, you still have your non-stop debates, panic talk actions and final arguments but a couple new additions made it... less enjoyable.The Bad -The story for the most-part as I said was a huge improvement over the last. However its the investigation before the final trial that really killed it for me. Its long, there is a TON of info you need to absorb and overall you kind of shut out only skimming over the text because it became a chore. Other than that, its was pretty decent.I said In my last review the characters were generic and stereotypical of their 'Ultimate Talents' and I said how from what little I knew of this game the problem would still persist. I wasn't wrong. While the characters certainly have more personality in this game compared to the first game again, you had generic looks for what their talent was. I also said how some characters took too much inspiration from the first game. Again, I wasn't wrong, A good portion of characters shared the same characteristics with characters from the first, though a couple had good reasons. Though props to the writers for having a female 'Ultimate Gamer', nice break from the norm.Now the gameplay. The Hidden Monokuma's I mentioned earlier? Yeah there are 30 of them. Again not a probelm. Wanna know something though? YOU ARE NOT REWARDED FOR GETTING THEM ALL. No Skills, No hidden story, No Hidden CG, NOTHING. Its such a waste of time and potential it makes you wonder why they bothered. Now, the class trials were butchered in this game. The standard features and writing were still solid don't get me wrong. But two things nearly ruined it for me. Hangmans Gambit and Logic Drive. Christ what made them think this was a good idea. While yes I complained Hangman's Gambit was far too easy in the first game and its difficulty is improved in the second for sure, but the mini-game itself is an absolute bore and a complete mess as well as being literally UNFAIR at times making some letters IMPOSSIBLE to avoid clashing. I wanted HG to change, but I wanted it to be fun, not a cheat. The new Rebuttal showdown... its definitely the best of the new modes and I would even go as far to say it should have fully replaced Panic Talk Action (which yes still suck). But the game didn't do the best job in explaining how it works and all around just felt clunky, not terrible, but still a pain. And Logic Drive, oh boy where do I start. Its basically a Q&A with a Third-Person... Skating? Segment in a cylindrical tube. Your forced to avoid objects, jump gaps all to get to a checkpoint where you answer a question which even makes the Hangmans Gambit from the first game look difficult. If there was ever a mini-game that felt out of place it was logic drive, easily the worst mistake they made with this game.And yes, still hate the pink blood but sometimes there is red blood nonsense.Tl;Dr, the game still suffers from some annoyances, but I think we all come to expect games to have those. But overall it is a much stronger entry in the series compared to the first and I highly recommend playing it if you haven't already."

Nonetheless, I chose to play it on MEAN MODE, because come on-- you gotta be a little masochistic to play a game about beloved characters getting picked off one by one in the first place.I was constantly impressed by how unique and charming the characters were. They all had complex, rich lives that I wanted to know more and more about-- but that was a little hard because MURDER.Oh, and the soundtrack during the murder investigations and trials? Daaaaaaang, son. I want that playing every time I'm trying to solve a problem.""Hey, how can we split the tab between five of us if Kate only had water?""*bow wow wow na naaaa na naaa na naaa*The murders were fascinating. Each setup was shocking, unique, and heartbreaking. The class trials were enormous fun that kept me up late into the night. Once I was on the case, I couldn't stop. Chapter 5 was especially gripping. Dude.Some of the gameplay mechanics were a little frustrating. Maybe it was because I played it on PC, but certain trial elements never seemed to function that well-- particularly the end one. I'm blanking on its name, but it's the one where you have to hit the button on the beat to destroy the shields. I've been a musician for about 2 decades and yet I could never line up the button right, unless I was in Fever Mode, when all my button mashings were deemed successes. Huh. Other than that, I figured out most of it.Some of the trial ""answers"" were logically ridiculous so I referred to a walkthrough (where others were complaining about the same thing), but those times were few and far between.For all the swear words and bloodshed, some of the game was too cutesy and fanservice-y for my taste. I got easily bored with Monokuma and Monomi's interactions. I also wasn't super invested in the over-arching Future Foundation storyline, though towards the end I did get more interested in it as twists were revealed. Speaking of the end -- no spoilers here -- oh gosh, soooo much dialogue. I mean, I get that it's a Visual Novel, so that's forgivable other places, but certain characters seemed to talk in circles. (The voice acting is A+ throughout, though.)I liked the end overall, though. It put an interesting spin on the previous gameplay, and I felt satisfied with everything. It carried the main themes through til the last line, and I loved the message, despite the constant bleakness of the scenarios.Thank goodness for ISLAND MODE because I don't know how else I'm supposed to fill this hole in me now."

Nobody would kill their friends of course, right? Probably yes, but here, if someone kills someone else and passes a class trial they get to go free and everyone wants to get out. This creates an engaging story of wondering who will be killed next and then focusing on who could have killed them, gathering up all the clues you can before the class trial to determine your fate with some fairly simple gameplay mechanics. I must admit, the highlight of the game for me comes from when the killer is found out. If the killer does get caught... they get brutally executed. Watching what execution Monokuma has come up with for the character's speciality is always a joy. The only real problem I have with the game is the end,which completely invalidates everything that has happened. No-one actually died, it was a virtual world and everyone was in a coma. I felt that was really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ but only the survivors got out of their coma and everyone else was stuck in theirs. I only now hope that in the anime (which is a continuation) they don't ruin it by ""Oh yeah, the survivors found a way to get them out. ♥♥♥♥ everything that happened in the game"". Concluding, Danganronpa 2 Goodbye Despair is a great game and better than the first.P.S Gundham is the best and a totally valid reason to buy the game exclusively for."

The first minigame is called logic dive, and you go on a mind snowboard (yes it's weird) and go down the right logic paths. The second one, rebuttal showdown, is where you slice other people's statements as fast as you can and is very similar to normal rebuttals.

There are also unlockable minigames and a ton of things to collect. If you're not the most talented gameplay-wise, but like to read stories, there's an option for that. You can also save at nearly any time!My personal favorite part of the game, aside from the main story, is the digital pet option. Every time you raise a pet fully, you'll get some coins, which you can use to buy presents! You can obtain different pets depending on how many gifts you give them, as well as cleaning up their... messes.The coins can also be obtained by completing trials or by finding hidden things. Presents help raise your connection with certain characters, giving you ""Hope Shards"". Each time you get a Hope Shard for a character, you'll learn more information about them. You can trade the shards in for useful skills during trials.There's also a leveling system. You can level up by just walking around, investigating things, etc. Each level gives you a skill slot. It will also give you more health in trials. Try to level up as much as you are able to.The soundtrack is incredible as well. It's always well-placed, giving a certain atmosphere to the scene.Please play the first game before playing the second.

Now that that is out of the way..This game is truly a worthy sequel to Trigger Happy Havoc. The new little mechanics (quick-travel, running, the ability to MOVE THE DAMN CAMERA WHEN YOU HIT ""TAB"" INSTEAD OF BEING LOCKED IN PLACE FOR A SOLID 4 TO 5 SECONDS EVERY TIME) make gameplay much more enjoyable. The courtroom minigames are engaging (though at times near the end of the game, the Revised Hangman's Gambit killed my no-damage streaks... I probably just need to Git Gud) and the new ones are pretty cool!As for the characters; wow! What a colorful and cute cast! I was afraid I'd forget half the characters by the time I was done since I'm really quite awful with names, but much to my pleasure, I was able to remember everyone's first and last names, their talents, their personalities, and all that good stuff! (By the way; Chiaki is the only GF that matters. I'll fight anyone that says otherwise.)Aaaaand Monokuma is a lovable pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥as always! The quips and throwbacks to the previous game all really make dealing with his presence again worth it.Then there's the storyline. I've made my way through a handful of visual novels with crazy twists in them, and this one's twists... Well. I won't say much for fear of spoiling the end, through there is a lot of foreshadowing (and thinking back, it all should have been obvious from the beginning) and the shock factor is constantly raised so every time you think you've hit the climax and you try to breathe for a second it turns out that something more dramatic was lurking right around the corner! I don't cry easily, but my vision got all blurry during the ending credits because my silly self was teary-eyed!Ah, I almost forgot! The other minigames! Island Mode and the Usami side game! Because of these minigames I am still not done playing this game to its completion. I will probably be investing another handful of hours while I try to hunt for achievements (and while I read the included novel; Danganronpa IF!). Not that that's bad!! I am very pleased that this game includes good post-game content. The more hours I can invest in this game; the better.In conclusion! If you enjoyed the first game, I can guarantee (with 97.3%* certainty) that you will enjoy its sequel!(The remaining 2.7% is for the people that may be unsatisfied with the ending sinceit follows the whole ""it was all a ~dream~ (or in this case; a ~simulation~)"" trope that lots of people see as a cop out, lol. I think it suits the story well, though, seeing as how the creators of this wonderful series love to pull stunts like these often.)"

I beat the game on the hardest difficulty within 26-30 hours, with some bonus time sprinkled in.+ Character development, music, and art are still fantastic. They also put a lot more effort into this title, with cutscenes and environments having a bit more ""oomph"" to them.+ The story is very interesting despite being seemingly ""obvious"" from the beginning. A lot of twists and turns that, just like the last game, have you on the edge of your seat. It also resolves a LOT of the issues the first game left unfinished, and without a cliffhanger!Cons:- PTA is... confusing. Not only does the timing feel off, they changed the system to where you have to hold it and let go according to the beat, which I admittedly must have missed completely in the explanation. What's funny about this is there is no system to correct this misunderstanding: you can freely spam the buttons without consequence, so that's what I ended up doing. A punishment system (especially on the hardest difficulty) to correct this mistake would have helped teach the mechanic.- The usage of a certain element as one of the motives felt like a cop-out. Some of the motives in this game in particular were pretty weak compared to the first one.- Even on hard mode, the experience was pretty easy to overcome, despite some ridiculous minigame sections.Overall:Danganronpa 2 is a solid follow-up to the first game. Again, not HUGELY into anime visual novels, but I would recommend the series to anyone with a love for investigative games."

The plot and story is alot more twisted than the first which I love alot, and the players of this killing game are just as memorable, almost better than the first group. I really do love this game, however, the controls in this one when using keyboard is ultimately confusing, mapping is all wrong and the release was plauged with screen tearing, frame rate issues.The first game was flawless and the control scheme was perfect, everything was perfect that made the game flow well. For example in this version, during the Trials, selecting the final blow, it explains that WASD is chosen to make the correct words, however on inspection, it was mapped to other keys, ZXCV. I would have to change the mapping in settings and another few annoyances as well. Also during the game, even though I chose to have ""keyboard and mouse"" buttons to show up on tutorials, it would show the control buttons instead, which was very confusing.The next main thing was the exploration of the Hotel grounds and walking from place to place. which was very akward to do as well. When walking left and right during the island exploration, in addition to pressing the buttons, I had to wiggle the mouse to move as well, or I would just use Q or E to skip to the next spot (which made it easier). When navigating the hotel grounds it was the same way, because in the first game the navigation was in 3d, in ways it was simlar, but I had to wiggle the mouse to even move. Dashing worked, but I still had to wiggle the mouse.Other from that, the story is too good to turn down just like the first one, so I have to recommend this 100%, even though there are a few minor/major issue depending on the issue to someone else, this game is perfect in all ways. I recommend using a controller with this game, ultimately because it feels better to play, and it is not the Vita port, it lacks the touch screen.8.5/10Pros:-- Briliant storytelling.-- Great soundtrack, something that you want to listen to again and again.-- Fun trial based combat, you have to think and gather information, piece it all together in a rushed situation.-- UI is great, improvment to the first PC port.-- Characters are awesome, even harder to read than the first game.Cons:-- Alot of black bars in ""window mode"", a sense of poor screen optimization.-- Contol scheme for keyboard is wrong, even when explained in the tutorials.-- Navigation in some scenes were subpar, hard to move without wiggling mouse.-- Screen tearing (Had to tweak v-sync in settings) - very minor-- Audio queues are sometimes slow, making it hard to perform some of the mini-games during trial."

Bullet-Time Battles, and the Closing Argument have been partially to totally reworked from the original and I would say it is a bit disorienting so far to see all of the changes (but that may be because I'm playing on the hardest difficulty) but there is nothing I found to be so different that I didn't understand what was going on.Hangman's Gambit and BTB (now called Panic Talk Attack, or PTA) are both significantly harder and are more proper challenges than the jokes they were in DR1.tl;dr Play DR1 first.

Be careful if you want to go into this game completely blind.>INTRO:Danganronpa 2:Goodbye Despair is the first game but majorly improved and polished. I'm sure that much is obvious since it's a sequel. The game is about some highschool students attending this amazing school called Hope's Peak Academy. Only the best of the best can attend it and those who do go are called ""Ultimates"". 2 is about these Ultimates going on a trip to a lovely island called Jabberwock Island. But... then some bad stuff happens with some talking teddy bears.The game features a great soundtrack and the visuals are quite nice too. It's practically a visual novel but with a lot of action in the way of ""Class Trials"". If you're a big anime fan then this game is also for you. It features jokes and cliches from manga/anime.MUSIC: The soundtrack is really nice. It can make you feel tense, happy, excited, pumped and a bunch of other positive/negative emotions. I really enjoy the fact the music can instill the right emotions at the right times. Though... some of the tracks are memorable some just get left in the dust. The tracks are usually displayed at the top right with the name.CHARACTERS:The characters are all unique so you can't confuse them with each holding an ultimate talent and filling in some type of trope. Not all of them are likeable in my opinion but I didn't mind going through there conversations and jokes. There's a lot of humour in this game and no matter your sense of humour, you'll probably get a chuckle out of it at some point. Oh yeah, there's a mechanic called ""Free Time"". When the story isn't advancing you can spend time with the people on the island. This stregthens your bonds and results in some funny/pleasant/weird/deep conversations. You can also gift them a present to make the bond even stronger. You gain hope shards from doing this and then you can use those to buy skills. You gain a small little thing added to the person you interacted with's report card. Each person can have there report card filled in 6 times. After this interacting with them doesn't do much. If you're a completionist you can try to max everyone's report card. Thought this will take beating the game and doing Island mode OR doing multiple playthroughs of the regular game.CRAP I CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO CATEGORIZE:Danganronpa 2 revolves around hope and despair. You can feel these two emotions through out with other emotions mixed in too. I have yet to get bored of a mechanic BUT I can see some which may annoy/get boring. You can level up with a cap of 99. You gain xp by walking around, examining and talking to people. Walking around can be insanely slow so there's a sprint button but while sprinting you take less steps and therefore get less exp. There's a weird pet mechanic which is like a Tomogatchi and as you walk it grows. You can give it presents and it will gain hope or you can leave it and it'll gain despair. If it reaches max despair it dies. It has a little pop-up in the bottom left when you should really check-up on your pet. Island mode is unlocked after beating the game and is a little sim which allows you to date all the characters. It'll take at least.. 4 playthroughs to get every characters ending. Though I haven't beaten the game I have read about how Island mode exists and I'm guessing it's 2's version of School mode. It's probably improved. Not sure.tl;dr:Buy this game, it's great. :^)"

Regardless I'm still buying this to play again because holy hell was it clever.You think it'll end up being a generic sequel with re-used characters but the mystery becomes just as complex and satisfying as the first game. Well Done SC - can't wait for the third game."

Then you won't been disappointed with the second installment.Art: 8.5/10 – The art style feels a little more refined in this installment. The game continues to deliver on many unique character poses like the first. They certainly didn't leave the funky character designs at home for this installment either, lots of crazy characters.Story: 9/10 -  More excellent murder mysteries delivered in the same context as the first. A vicious school battle show down. There is also a nice twist at the end that you might not see coming.Music: 8.5/10- Great like in the first installment, I love Monomi's funky theme along with Monokuma's. The one downside is that there aren't nearly as many new tracks on the sequel so you might get bored with the repeats.Game Mechanics: 7.5/10-  Great mysteries again. Nice that they changed up the mini games from the first. The only thing that made me angry is being unable to skip some of the minigames. I hate the platformer part and I just wanted to answer the questions without all the bs minigame.Positive: Had to exercise my brain muscles again on the mysteries in this game. Kept me on my toes with twists and turns like the first. I also felt that there was more depth in the characters this time.Negative: Again I wanted to have multiple endings with different characters."

The characters didn't seem as interesting and realistic (at first), the murders didn't seem as logical (2 out of 5 still don't), the trial action was annoying at times (the logic dive takes ages and the hangman's gambit is impossible to beat with no damage taken) and, personally, I didn't like the setting of a tropic island. But when the plot started thickening, the game became a roller coaster of mind-blows and emotions. The first game was amazing, but this game made me cry for a prolonged period of time. If you liked the first game - you are obligated to play this one.All the petty complaints I listed above are nothing. They aren't just easy to overlook, you won't remember them, like they are a part of your life at Hope's Peak Academy.

The trials also progress in a way that helps you understand all the details of the murders.I thought the plot was interesting. During the later chapters especially, it was hard for me to put the game down. It kept me guessing and had its little twists and turns. Definitely enjoyed it in terms of storytelling. However, the pacing can be a bit slow, particularly during daytime sessions in earlier chapters.Although some of the characters were not particularly interesting to me, I did have my favorites. Also, at first glance some of the cast looked a little like repeats of characters from Danganronpa 1, but after a while I started seeing them as their own characters. Some of them made me laugh, some annoyed me, others made me cringe. Voice acting is also good (English) as well as soundtrack.Last thing I would say is...if you buy the game, you may be turned off by the ridiculous fanservice in the earlier parts of the game. But!

,Recommended,413420,29867896,Posted: 12 February,all,[scah],"Shut yer trap, Monomi!!!As a fan of the original Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc on the PSVita, purchasing Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair felt like a compulsory act. Never has a game quenched my highschool-murder-mystery-visual-novel thirst (which I never knew I had in the first place) like this series has.Under the pristine, clean look of the UI, character designs, and flashy cutscenes, Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair eventually takes on an incredibly dark, sinister atmosphere contrasting mature and sickening themes with a clean and bright anime aesthetic. With the kickass soundtrack providing ample background music (even if it sometimes gets repetitive), as well as fitting themes for when the narrative gets tense, the game never feels empty like some other virtual novels do. You're exploring an entire ""world"" on the island your character gets stranded on from the very beginning, with the exactly the same amnesiac mindset of how he got there.Eventually, however, Danganronpa 2 loses its luster with what amounts to a somewhat predictable story structure. While this is a series staple, it would have been a great addition for the game to mix up the narrative sequencing of this aprx. 20 hour experience. Aside from this minor complaint, the ever present mysterious and near-hidden gloomy atmosphere of this game never subsides, coercing the player into a constant questioning mindset in what amounts to a gripping experience.Since I didn't play most of the added content mini-games (including the knock-off tamagotchi on the pause menu or the Magical Girl Usami themed battle-hybrid-thing, which both I assumed were stupid time sinks), I can't really fairly critique them. But, obviously, they don't really impact the story and are just optional filler that doesn't interrupt gameplay.The classroom trial minigames, however, are another story. Point-blank: they're extremely mediocre but an improvement from the first game. My advice? Play on easy. You're not losing out on the pivotal narrative experience the game offers.Overall, the anime styling, inside jokes, or not playing the first game in the series are the only things that should keep anyone from playing this game.8.5/10 ￣(ㅇㅅㅇ❀)￣"

The story was original, yet built on the winning formula established in the 1st game.Negatives:- like the first game, little to no replay value, yet the first playthrough was worthwhile.- it is strongly recommended that you have played Danganronpa 1.  While #2 can be played as a stand alone title, you will have a richer experience having played #1 first.Highly recommend"

Of course that's because I love games with good stories, which this game does have, but in my opinion you really have to play both games to understand it. I like how the class trials work, only thing I kind of dislike is Hangman's gambit (which is one of the mini games), it's not bad but it just takes way too long to finish at times. But a new addition to the game which they didn't have in the last one is the Logic Dive, which is actually pretty fun if you ask me.The characters are awesome and full of personality, of course there are one or two you might think are forgettable, but in the end the character development is pretty good.The pet system is another new addition to the franchise, although I didn't really mess around with it all all basically, it's still sad when you get a notification saying (oh your pet is dead btw).I'd recommend this game for whoever is really into story telling more than the actual gameplay, because this is certainly what this game bring to the table, a good story with interesting characters, laughs, and feels ;-;"

At one point Hinata and Sonia imply that their main language is English but if you work on Sonia's report card she claims that she came to become a regular Japanese girl at a Japanese school and there are barely any Japanese schools that have English as their main language. (Edit: Okay there are some... but I really doubt that Hope's Peak is an English school in Japan) Also the translation does make the game feel a little petty and easy or make no sense at all.The mini games have been revamped and the bullet time battle or panic time action (pta lol) is easier for me but the stupid hangman's gambit is much worse (The first game was much more easier, it feels easy at first but no wait till you get to the case 5; I feel so lucky actually getting the no damage achievement)Now that I'm done with the bad parts, I'm going to say this is a good game and I would 100% recommend it. If you didn't cry in the first game like me probably you are going to in this one.  Your favorite character and pet is most likely going to die (It poops wayyyyy too much). The game is fun and enjoyable and there's more content than the first game [the more angst the better! :)].If you're going to watch Danganronpa 3 Zetsubou hen, this game is recommended since the opening gives away spoilers."

While playing, I felt as though the story was incredibly rich and suspenseful and it was progressed so perfectly so that no amount of knowledge about the first game mattered. In conclusion, the story is far from a rehash of the first game, the music is sub-par, the artwork/graphics are great in my opinion, the characters are somewhat complex, and the gameplay is immersive.cons- However, the PC porting was fairly lazy at some parts, of which there was barely any way to determine a difference from the PS Vita version (Such as the controls not explained, or the cropping being done poorly)"

Is it better than the first one? At some aspects, yes, but in general I would say it's far worse. As a sequel - it's good. As a standalone game... not so much, really - just decent or barely alright.Things that were equally good as in the first game:Music.Graphic.Length.Amount of content.Including CGs, number of chapters, characters, items, extras and all that.Absolutely worth the price.Whether you enjoy this game or not, the amount of work that was put into it, plus all the things mentioned above, especially large content, makes it worth the price, which, sadly, cannot be said about many other visual novels.Things that were better in ""Danganronpa 2"":Gameplay mechanics.Trials works better. They feel more ""alive"" and realistic, mini games are easier to get grasp on (although still rather annoying), logic dive is pretty fun, hangman was improved. You get option to not only contradict what character is saying, but also to back up their argument, which is neat.Protagonist.At first I thought Hinata will be Makoto copy, but he is far better. He isn't just going with the flow, he seems to have his own opinions and since the very beginning of the game, he definitely is the more compelling character. Also, with Makoto it always felt like he was literally just echoing what other people already told him or suggest him. WithoutByakuya and Kyokohe wouldn't make much progress on his own. Hinata is better in that aspect - of course, at times, he is lead by others, but it's never so annoying and withChiakiit also fits nicely into the story.Ending.Without spoilers, I will just say that it was satisfying and actually better than ending to the first ""Danganronpa"". A lot of details regarding mine story is unraveled.Things that were worst in ""Danganronpa 2"":Tone.Game's tone shifts dramatically from this ""usually serious, with occasional jokes and fan service moment"" from first game to ""usually totally out of place humor, with tons of fan service, referring to previous game and sometimes a bit serious tone"". And that isn't great with the game like that.It drags.It really does. I skipped like 1/4 of annoying, too lengthy conversations in this game and didn't miss any important bit.3rd and 4th chapters.They feel the most out of place and completely discontented from the story. Also, the character's motives are all over the place.Too anime.Anime lovers will probably stab me with fork after that statement, but I do not enjoy the classic anime troops. I find them silly and cringy. Of course Danganronpa is anime-styled game and that was obvious from the start. The thing is, first part, even though it has moments like that, isn't overflowing with them. It's actually enjoyable even for people who don't like this type of humor and character creation.Too much Monokuma & Monomi.I loved every Monokuma's moment in first game. Here, after few first chapter, almost every moment with him or Monomi (and especially with him and Monomi together) was skipped by me. Beyond annoying.Characters.That was a very strong point of the first game. Here... well. Protagonist andNagito, Baby Gangsta, Chiakiare really well presented. EspeciallyNagito, who was the most intriguing part of the game and force that moved story forward. Others though... well, let's just say it's: anime troops on top of fan service on top of not-making-much-sense and ridiculous behaviors.Cases.That's a big pain for me, because I really enjoyed cases from the first game. More, they were a thing that made that game so interesting to me. Sure, some were rather easy (so Makoto's cluelessness felt a bit annoying at times), but here... I swear to you - each of these students is like a Ultimate Serial Killer, with their planning, which makes other students seem like they are Ultimate Trail-progression-tools, because some of gathered hints don't actually make a lot of sense on their own, unless other character explicitly say what - sadly - game creators have in mind, because seriously, even Ultimate Detective would have a hard time with those.Who can I recommend this game?People who loved the first one for its humor and anime-style rather than case-solving and mysteries.Who I cannot recommend this game?People who enjoy solving cases, who liked this ""desperate"" atmosphere of the first game, who looks for logic and consistency rather than another ""surprise"" behind a corner, that doesn't make much sense.And because of that, even though I see a lot of good things in this game, as a person from the second group, I really can't give it a thumbs up."

,Recommended,413420,23237286,"Posted: 27 May, 2016",all,sorcrane,"It isHIGHLYrecommended you finish the first game before playing Danganronpa 2. Failure to do so will result in quite a bit of confusion about the plot and wholly lessens the overall experience. It is also recommended (but not necessary) to read the light novel Dangan Ronpa Zero first.Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair (originally released as Super Dangan Ronpa 2: Farewell Despair Academy in Japan) is the exciting sequel to the original Dangan Ronpa game, which you can find on Steam under “Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc”. As a sequel, many elements have been carried over from the first game, both gameplay-wise and plot-wise. I’ll be abbreviating Danganronpa 2 as SDR2 from this point on.The game is a mixture of murder mystery (of which there are many), stereotypical anime traits (crazy hair, pink blood, fanservice), inappropriately timed sometimes black humor (which gives the game its unique atmosphere), “social linking” a la Persona 3/4, and… a deep, deep fascination for hope - and despair.First, the murder mysteries. SDR2 consists of six chapters, with some chapters containing more murders than others. Each chapter has a “Daily Life” and a “Deadly Life” portion - “Daily Life” is pre-murder, “Deadly Life” post-murder discovery. Certain chapters are weaker than others, but on a whole, the murder mysteries have improved from the first game. Murder mysteries are solved in Class Trials, where characters present arguments - and you literally shoot contradictions with “argument bullets”, among other gameplay mechanics - in order to solve the mystery.Perhaps most importantly, the trials for the murders are a significant improvement from the first game - the amount of Captain Obvious has been reduced, more complex and fun mechanics have been introduced (a sword fight, a snowboard minigame, AGREEING rather than CONTRADICTING, people contradicting YOU), and each case is very well written out. If you’ve played through the first game, prepare for a big step up in difficulty starting from the very first trial. This difficulty jump is appropriate and makes SDR2 much more satisfying.The characters themselves are a diverse crew, but should feel somewhat similar to the first game’s cast. SDR2 loves its parallels to DR, but be warned - any assumptions made based on parallels will probably come back to bite you. The level of insanity present in these characters has not gone down at all from the first game, and there are several characters (not named due to spoilers) who keep things very… interesting. The voice actors continue to perform admirably, so expect spending long hours on the dialogue as you listen rather than skip through the text.An interesting fun fact is that Komaeda Nagito has the same voice actor and Ultimate talent as Naegi Makoto, the protagonist of the first game. Their names are quite similar as well…Once again, you have Free Time available during “Daily Life”, where you can effectively social link with the other characters. Ranking up is much easier than the first game, with each character limited to 6 pages of info, and practically every gift-giving nets you a rank up. You should be able to max four relationships in one playthrough. And as usual, it’s a game of guessing if the character you like and ranked with is going to die or not!Expect hope and despair to be taken to the extreme - Spike Chunsoft isn’t holding anything back when it comes to this. When you finish the game, hopefully you too will be able to say -“Farewell, Despair Academy!”"

,Recommended,413420,33166948,Posted: 2 July,all,Newbie SCFT,"I'm iffy to recommend this.The game itself is fantastic. The story is well written, characters are enjoyable, etc etc.However, this game has been pretty harsh on me by changing my controls from Keyboard and Mouse to Controller in the middle of the game (So I have no idea how to do a majority of the things required in the cases) and NOT SAVING MY GAME AT ALL. (It happened four ♥♥♥♥ing times in the first three cases. Still haven't gone past Case Three since I lost my save.)Some of my complaints may just be me, and if so I'm just unlucky, but that's not all.Some of the games played in the cases (Hangman's Gambit, Make your Argument, BTB/PTA, etc) have been changed and not exactly for the better. For example: Hangman's Gambit was, in the first game, a simple word game where they'd present a word with some letters missing and you'd figure it out by shooting the letters. Simple, quick, fun.In this game, Hangman's Gambit is a simple word game where they give you a phrase with no hints besides the length of the words in it, you must match the letters by pressing Z(Remember, I have had troubles getting my controls due to a random switch mid-game caused by the game.) on one and shooting it at the same letters by pressing LeftClick. Okay, doesn't seem bad at first. By doing so, they stay on screen without movement, and increase in size. You can get rid of the combined letter by either shooting them with Z, which gets rid of them entirely, or LeftClick which will act as you trying to place the letter there. Alright, still good. The letters now move across a screen and you must make sure they either touch the same letter and avoid all other letters. Still makes sense, but what was wrong with the other one?A couple new mini-games were introduced like Logic Dive and Rebuttal Battles, both of which are fine.Hell, I'd dare say Logic Dive is the best thing in Danganronpa 2. It adds a much needed action segment to break up the logic heavy segments. Sometimes it's nice to not think too hard.Rebuttal Battles are a nice change into arguments since it adds a little more depth. Having to fight the counter-arguments of the classmates in order to continue the trial is cool. It's not much different from the actually arguments in how you complete them (SHOOT BULLET [Called Truth Blades in Rebuttals] AT LOGICAL ERROR AND WIN) but it's a nice little add-on.So again, It's an iffy recommendation since I've had nothing but problems with it but the game itself is fine.I would love to sing praises about the game but I can't. I can't finish it unless I do it in one sitting. I CAN'T BEAT THE GAME UNLESS IT'S ONE SITTING. FROM PROLOUGE START TO END OF GAME. IT WON'T SAVE FOR ME.If you do buy it, though. As long as no technical issues arise, you're in for a fun game."

The story begins with you, as Hajime Hinata, preparing to enter Hope's Peak Academy. Suddenly, you find yourself drawn to a mysterious door. After entering the door, you find yourself in a classroom with 15 other students. A rabbit named Usami introduces herself and says that you've all been brought on a school field trip and that everyone is meant to get along. The classroom falls away and reveals a tropical paradise. Suspicion slowly fades and as everyone begins to enjoy themselves, Monokuma, the derranged half/half bear from Danganronpa 1 shows up and crashes the party. You're told that you need to kill someone and get away with it to get off of the island. Sound familiar?The game gives the big reveal from Danganronpa 1 right away, that you're students from Hope's Peak Academy that have had your memories erased, the world destroyed, and you were brought to this island for an unknown purpose. The great twist in the story is finding out the true nature as to why you were brought to the island and this is where the game really shines. Unravelling that mystery is done really well. However, the main gameplay element of the game, the class trials, are the game's biggest weakness. The trials were unnecessarily extended out and minor details were given extreme importance just for the sake of placing in another minigame or extra feature. That brings me to a second issue I had with the trials. Since this game was originally for the PS Vita, the new features were more made for the Vita rather than the PC. The new slashing mini-game during the trials seems especially the case. The ""Improved Hangman's Gambit"" also seems to be the case. The best non-Vita specialized minigame were the rebuttals by various students, but that feature was also a problem since it caused a lot of unnecessary extension of the trials. You usually had to rebute someone's gut feeling who was rebuking your evidence-based theory. The trials seemed to get more and more frustrating as they went on, as the developers seems to really try hard to make each trial extend out into 3-hour long affairs (broken into 2 convenient parts).Keeping all that in mind, I think I give a light recommendation to Danganronpa 2. If there is an anime coming out based on this game, I would definitely say wait for that to come out. It might also be better to just watch a playthrough and get through the first couple of trials to see if it's something you'd be interested in."

Starting a new chapter lightheartedly, everything going well just spending free time with your 2nd favourite character talking about this and that, boom dead. And that goes on for 6 chapters and you just get used to it (but tears are still shed).

,Recommended,413420,22509540,"Posted: 18 April, 2016",all,Deity,"Sixteen highschool students, trapped in a tropical paradise, are forced to kill each other. The only way to make it off the island is to murder a fellow classmate and not get caught by the remaining students. If they manage to deduce the killer, the murderer is executed. If they fail to deduce the killer, they are executed. This is Danganronpa 2.First of all I recommend you play Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc if you haven't. While this sequel doesn't require you to have played the first game to understand the story, certain characters, events, and the backdrop for the story are more thoroughly explained in Danganronpa 1.Danganronpa 2 puts you in the shoes of Hajime Hinata, an extraordinary highschool student known as an ""Ultimate"". Ultimates are simply put, the best possible high school student in a specific field. ""Ultimate"" baseball player, ""Ultimate"" martial artist, etc. However, Hajimeis the Ultimate clichéhas amnesia, and can't actually remember his Ultimate ability. Hajime and 15 other ""Ultimates"" are taken on a field trip to a peaceful and relaxing island with a giant bomb at the center of it planted by a stuffed bear and the only way to get off the island before it explodes is to get away with murder. Wait. What?Danganronpa 2 can be best described as absurd yet logical. Taking itself just the right amount of seriously, it combines the two concepts into one majestic game that is just as likely to confuse you with its quirks as it is to confuse you with its complex logic problems. Once the inevitable murder of one of your classmates happens, the game splits into two parts: the murder investigation, and the class trial. During the investigation, you're left to explore the island in 2D adventure game style, finding evidence and speaking with witnesses. After an arbitrary amount of time passes that the game dictates, the class trial starts. Found in the form of you deducing the murderer behind your classmates death, the puzzles are outrageously unique. Contrary to the first Danganronpa, murders are less predictable. The events are complex, and much more detailed than in the first game, and while they are off the wall and require metaphorical backflips to deduce, the answers are always logical.On the other hand, the trial part of the game is more annoying than logical. Playing out like Phoenix Wright, you present your evidence that you collected after the murder happened, and present your theories. Unfortunately, much like Phoenix Wright, you don't actually get punished for guessing incorrectly. Selecting the wrong answer will cause the game to immediately point out that it's incorrect, and if you get too many incorrect, you have to start the entire trial over again. In addition, your many other classmates in the trial don't actually solve anything. Their only reason for existence is to challenge your deductions, and to make you play worthless minigames that don't actually add anything to the story, but are rather put in place to ensure that the player is trulyunderstandingthe storyline. Unfortunately many of these minigames require exact input of the answer that the game wants you to input. You could have a thorough understanding of the murder and events, and yet fail due to phrasing or the exact word isn't what the game was looking for. Multiple trials take place during the game.In addition to the murders, gameplay also involves a simple social simulator. You can become friends with the other students, giving them their preferred gifts and them giving you information about themselves in return. It's all rather shallow, but nothing that detracts from the overall story.The storyline is fantastic. It all comes together at the end in the most magnificent way possible, and compared to the complete predictability of the first game, is entirely unpredictable until the very end. The characters are all interesting, the dialogue is genius in the most absurd way possible, the voice acting is top notch, the puzzles are superb, the mystery is complex, the soundtrack is decent, and the graphics are unique. Much like a storybook, your environments seem to be made of paper, and ""pop up"" into existence, and the beautiful island can be fully explored without all the bloodstains after you complete the main storyline and unlock ""Island Mode"", an alternate reality where the murders never take place and you spend your days levelling up your students and performing activities. Not the deepest of game modes, but it's a nice addition for those concerned with longevity.The only true downside are the minigames. Longer and more annoying than in Danganronpa 1, but just as finicky and arbitrary, these only serve to frustrate. However, the storyline more than makes up for it. If you like complex puzzles, unpredictable yet intelligent storylines, absurd humor, or you simply want to play something unique, unlike any game you've played before, then give Danganronpa 2 a try. I wholeheartedly recommend it."

The game starts some time after the events in D:THH. However, despite being a sequel, there's really not much difference or improvements in terms of gameplay in D2:GD. This might be good for some but personally I think this is a really lazy attempt at making a sequel. This doesn't mean the game's bad, though. It's just a bit too similar for me to actually call it a sequel. Like in the previous game, D2:GD main attraction is the visual novel aspect, the murder mystery and of course, the varied and colourful cast of characters.Like I said before, there's very little improvements in terms of gameplay. It still played the same as in D:THH. There are a few mini-games added in the class trial but I find them to be tedious to go through. The (Improved) Hangman's Gambit in particular is one of my least favourite mini-game, followed by Rebuttal Showdown and Logic Dive.About 75% of the game consist of clicking and reading through massive amount of text, a standard aspect of a visual novel game. If you're not into that kind of gameplay, please don't pick this game up. While you can't actually date any of the girls, it's highly recommended to spend some time with them and give them gifts to strengthen your bond with them. Not only they give out special ability to use in the Class Trial after fully bonding with them, you also get some back story and other hidden personality they don't normally show. Just don't get too attached, as you never know when they might die.The murder mysteries, unfortunately, is on the same level like in D:THH. It's a bit too easy to deduce. Compared to the Ace Attorney series, the mysteries in D2:GD is clearly the inferior. Also like in D:THH, the Class Trial is also either too straightforward or too vague. Not having the ability to read the summary of your Truth Bullets without opening up the menu is annoying as hell.While the new characters are interesting in their own right, those who played D:THH will find most of these characters a bit too similar to the characters from D:THH. Despite this, player will still find a favourite character to get attach with (though mine died early on). Also a really, REALLY, annoying one too (f**king hate that guy).Another thing before purchasing this game. This game will make you feel depressed at key moments. One is particularly heart wrenching. So if you're the type that gets upset quickly, it's best not to finish playing this game in one sitting.RECOMMENDED: For those who played D:THH and enjoyed it.NOT RECOMMENDED: For those who didn't play D:THH"

,Recommended,413420,33808749,Posted: 26 July,all,Zebulan,"Here's the deal; Danganronpa: Happy Trigger Havoc set the stage for an amazing universe of chaos and u-turns.  Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair plays off of that stage, but feels more of an appetizer than a main course.  Although it effectively is a *longer* game somehow, it actually felt shorter.  I was less excited to launch Danganronpa 2 between sessions, whereas the first Danganronpa lowered my productivity at work as it was always on the mind.  Some reasons for this?  Well, Danganronpa 2 is ""more of the same"" - which in this universe is NOT a bad thing - but it was so much easier to predict events, because it was almost identical to the first game of the series.  If you think about it really hard, I could effectively be saying ""this game would have been better if I didn't play the first one,"" which is a catch twenty-two, because without playing the first one, this one is just a garbled mess of information that won't really add up in your mind.Furthermore, the story is still great - you'll start out absolutely confused, because that's clearly the authors point, and later have clarity when the pieces start falling together.  It's a great mind-**** the second time around, that's for sure (no matter how similar the game is to its predecessor, you can't predict every curveball)!The mini games in this Danganronpa suck worse, too; the ""improved"" Hangman's Gambit can **** ** **** because I hated that so much.  The Logic Drive was interesting, but otherwise annoying... overall though, it did add a change of pace to the stage.Although my commentary may lean somewhat negative, don't take this as a negative review at all.  At the end of the day, Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is *more of the same* to the first game, and know that Danganronpa: Happy Trigger Havoc was absolutely amazing - therefore, this game is also amazing - but it's a sliver behind, so a super-close second place.  If it were less predictable (in other words: why did you use the same tricks?), I probably would have loved it that much more - but truly at times, I pushed through the game just to get to the end.I won't give up on the Danganronpa series though, oh no!  I'm now an absolute fan of the Danganronpa universe, count me in!  These stories were excellent to read and exhilarating!"

If you didn't play Danganronpa 1, stop whatever you are doing and go play that instead as this is a direct sequel to it. If you have played Danganronpa 1 then you are merely wondering if you should buy the sequel. The short answer is yes.Some of things I liked about Danganronpa 2:+ One Class Trial which I really liked and really hit the despair. Although all of the Class Trials were enjoyable.+ An interesting climax and reveal to the game. Although it does get a little too Meta.+ The additional option of agree statements in the Class Trials was a good addition.+ The Rebuttal Showdowns were pretty cool as well. Although there was one showdown I had trouble with due to not realizing I can do more damage with a diagonal strike.+ How even some of the more “Silly” truth bullets end up playing a pivotal role in the trial's outcome.I only have a few complaints about Danganronpa 2. Notably the following:- I feel like Monokuma goes a bit too far with some of his motive delivery this time as some of motives interfere with Free Will more. But I guess that is part of his master plan this time around.- Some of the characters are way over the top (I'm looking at you Supreme Warlock Overlord Gundham with his Four Dark Devas [read: hamsters] of Destruction!), but I suppose that is to be expected from this series.- While the Logic Drive addition has an interesting series of questions, I am more meh on the entire mechanic. Also feel like there were too many of these and they were too long.- The “Escape Room” puzzle was annoying because the puzzle mechanics were not obvious, although the game would let you skip it.- The game is WAY more Fan Servicey than the previous one was.And the following fake complaints:- 5 hours out of the 33 it took to beat this game resulted in lost sleep. Thats like nearly 20%  :(- This game is not Sakuras' Revenge :DAll I can say is despite these few complaints I really enjoyed this game. I can't wait for Danganronpa 3!"

Innovative Gameplay, Interesting/Complex Mysteries and a Good Story. It may be heavy on reading but it keeps you hooked the whole time. It's a must play for anyone who likes games that make you think.Play the first game first though!! Don't start with this one.EDIT: Since playing more of the game, I definitely feel it's not anywhere near as good as the first one. The Minigames are awful and for me took away a lot from the game. Mostly because the mini games pretty much solve the logic puzzle for you rather than you figuring it out on your own. This game, unlike the first, has a ridiculous amount of fan service which was a little off putting, The characters aren't nearly as likeable as DR1 and some of the wording in the trials leave you completely stumped as to what is going on or what the answer is. I like the game, but I wish it stuck with the formula of the first game rather than trying to do the ridiculous mini games."
76561198016098972,Recommended,413420,24156220,"Posted: 7 July, 2016",all,X-TheDark,"Ah...the summer breeze, palm trees, a weird sense of deja vu and an awesome soundtrack.Welcome to (Super) Danganronpa 2, the sequel to the first game, Danganronpa : Trigger Happy Havoc.Before I try to describe the details, let's get this out of the way first :This game (especially the last chapter) contains MAJOR spoilers to how the first game ended and the mystery behind that game, play DR: Trigger Happy Havoc first(or watch a walkthrough/read through a let's play - just search for ""orenoren"", the guy did an amazing let's play (text-based) with alot of interesting tidbits and stuff, it's good.So, what exactly IS Danganronpa 2? Well, the best way to describe it is ""Phoenix Wright on steroids"". At it's core, this is a mystery visual novel-style game with some ""action"" elements fused into it.Minor spoiler into the central mechanic of the game : Class Trials (and why they happen)The central mechanic of this series is pointing finger at killers (yes, there will be killing) during Class Trials (no, seriously, I wasn't joking when I said this was Phoenix Wright on steroids).For all intents and purposes, your goal is to...well...solve the mysteries you are presented with. I could go on a long rant about the elements of the game, but the tutorial explains them pretty well, but I guess I should give you a summary so you understand how this game is ""played"". This is done in ""phases"" (played on maximum difficulty settings):Non-Stop Debate - most common phase during the Class Trial. Basically a ""different"" version of Phoenix Wright's series witness testimonies. People talk, some statements have words that can be ""shot"" with a Truth Bullet (read: evidence that this information contradicts). Although there are parts where you must ""present evidence"" from your inventory, for the most part, you just need to choose from the ones game gives you for the section (it gets changed for each debate, you get 3-10 Truth Bullets to select the right one from during the debate). There are also ""agree spots"". Instead of shotting toprove they are wrong, you need to shoot them with evidence thatproves they are rightHangman's Gambit - meeeehhh. Most of the things they ask you to spell make sense, but some things don't (or are not immediately appearent as tohow they want you to phrase them.Letters fly, you collide same-ones and then either choose to remove them or to place them in the answer (1 letter at a time). With increased difficulty, later ones (one in specific in Chapter 4) can become rather...difficult (since we don't have stylus-based touch controls).Rebuttal Showdown - awesome music during this section. Basically, you ""cut"" some useless statements, advance to parts where there are weak points (like Non-Stop Debate) and select one of the ""Truth Blades"" (yeah, this game is clever...) to ""cut"" the statement. If you don't see how this resembles a one-on-one Non-Stop Debate...well, I just told you that it does.Panic Talk Action - a rhythm game (not joking). You click/release the left mouse button based on rhythm to destroy your opponent's remarks. Once you have done so long enough, you are presented with a weak statement that you need to press W/A/S/D in correct order to spell out the answer.Logic Dive - ermmm...surfing...game...thing? Really, you go through a forward-autoscrolling obstacle course (camera view from behind) and at certain points, you get to choose the correct ""road"" to go onto. If you choose the wrong one, you restart from a nearby checkpoint (those are pretty common). All in all, an easy and straightforward section.And that's basically it for how the game is played. I can't really tell you what's the plot/synopsis/etc for this game without giving away spoilers...so gameplay description will have to do. Many plot twists, many weird things happen, etc good stuff.All in all, I enjoyed the hell out of this game. Wholeheartedly recommend, especially if you are a fan of Phoenix Wright series, the mysteries in these games are pretty damn good.Remember the advice I gave at the start: you really should play through the first one before this one"
,Recommended,413420,34448303,Posted: 23 August,all,symphonite,"Let's be real here.The only thing that makes Danganronpa 1 and 2 so fun and compelling are the murder mysteries and the detective styled visual novel gameplay, with fun plot twists in the middle of every trial.Otherwise, the story is, in the end, pretty mediocre. The concept of despair and hope is a recurring theme throughout the entire story, it's a cool concept as you don't see many other stories that revolve around this theme. However, in my opinion, it becomes gradually very tedious, especially with Nagito emphasizing on this idea of hope/despair pretty much every time you see him.The punishments at the end of each trial are so so terrible and boring even compared with Trigger Happy Havoc. The first punishment is alright, but the rest are so boring you lose the thrill. Trust me I don't enjoy watching people get executed (at least most of the time) but if you've played Danganronpa 1 and/or 2 you will get what I mean by the 'thrill' you get.Ultimately, I would still recommend Danganronpa: Goodbye Despair for their amazing murder mysteries and atmoshperic soundtrack, but the story and boring punishment scenes really bring my rating down.I give it a...11037/10Ok, honestly, a 6/10"

Still retains that quirkyness and subtle horror of the first game, but improves the graphics by quite a bit. The world is also much bigger, and the characters are more endearing. Adds a few extra features, bonuses, minigames, and easter eggs abound. If you're playing with english audio, the voice acting has also improved since the first game. Overall, I highly recommend this game to people who enjoyed the original."

I mean, maybe I'm not that qualified to give my opinion on this, because I was already not really a big fan of the first game; but even though the first one had quite a few flaws, like the ridiculous story and a few irritating characters, overall it was still enjoyable to me. The sequel on the other hand takes all these flaws and turns them up to eleven:- The story and murder cases this time around are utterly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and nonsensical.- While the first game had a desperate and isolated atmosphere, truly fitting for the overall theme of despair, everything in this game just feels so goofy, exaggerated and overblown, that I couldn't take half of it seriously. Oh, and expect lots and lots of 4th wall breaks and self referential humor. Gotta love those, right?- Somehow they managed to make the minigames even more annoying and unintuitive.- The various characters, arguably the heart of these games, are so much worse than its predecessor, that it's not even funny. They are way too over the top, to the point that they just become grating to deal with. It goes way beyond being one dimensional or stereotypical; you just can't imagine these lunatics ever existing or functioning in real life. Everyone is crazy, everyone has a messed up past and strange values. One person is a glutton, she will think about nothing but food even in life and death situations. One character is sad someone turned out to be a murderer, the next moment she happily forgives him and recites the catchphrase of this game: ""We gotta do our best, for his sake!"" It all just feels so artificial.  It's a flaw a lot of japanese media has IMO: style over substance.Even if you bother to spend time with them, some character may reveal a superficial character flaw after a while, wich will never be brought up again and doesn't really matter. Oh, but you get their underwear as a reward. Aren't you glad you wasted time on this?- The characters motivations for doing stuff and especially their motives for commiting murder dont make any lick of sense half of the time, which doesn't really help with endearing them to the player. It's probably not a good sign, that, while I was often saddened by the death of characters in the first game, I couldn't care less when someone died in this game. On the contrary, most of the time I was glad when someone finally bites the dust.It's fair to say I was pretty much on Monokuma's side the whole time.-As for positive things: music is still enjoyable, graphics are alright and I encountered no bugs or glitches while playing.Damn, that turned out longer than I wanted. So in conclusion, if you are like me and already had to massively strain your suspension of disbelief and tolerance for anime tropes during the first game, especially in regards to characters and story, avoid this one. Seriously, it feels like a different dev-team worked on this game. If you don't give a crap about this, get it on a sale, because that price is ridiculous for a VN."

I was actually scratching my head for a moment to think what the hell this was.3. uh. uhm. oh yeah the loli gets killed by a nurse. i think. someone else too.4. i'm pretty sure this is the part where robo-boy gets murdered by hamster-man5. the only memorable case in the entire game that i won't spoil without tags.Nagito the Kommunist makes an elaborate suicide that's not actually an elaborate suicide in order to lure out the 'traitor' of the group, who's actually Chiakers (who has been working in the group's interests since she's not actually a traitor). He does this by using his ""Ultimate Lucky Talent"" by merely 'hoping' that the traitor will kill him in order to kill everyone else since he figured out a ♥♥♥♥while ago that they're actually all the remnants of despair.that was seriously the only case in the entirety of Danganronpa that was still memorable and fun after the fact.6. ＪＵＮＫＯ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ＥＳ ＢＡＣＫ ＡＧＡＩＮ and everyone is despair people (but the actual ending implies they aren't or something? that doesn't make any sense but ok) also everything is computer simulation but you totally didn't find that out ages ago when it was basically shown to you at the very start.in short, everything but case 5 (if I even have the numbering right on that) is forgettable garbage. other forgettable garbage is the poorly written characters translated by the WORST localization company of all time, NISA, who are also known for doing the worst neptunia translations and the worst falcom translations.danganronpa only serves as an example of why you shouldn't make a mystery game rely entirely on its twists. they might be fun while you're playing but when you think about it for two seconds everything about it is bad, cringey, poorly-written, and generally a waste of your time for a good majority of the game. that's apparently enough to get people to say its good because people rarely put thought into their jappo forms of entertainment leading to mass fandoms for complete and utter garbage.play ace attorney trilogy instead"

After playing through the first trail, I can confirm that this sequel is COMPLETELY inferior. They took all the good thing about the first game and gave them steroids to the point it's not even funny. In the fist game there were only a few silly characters like Hifumi, Sakura, and Toko. However in this game there are only a few normal characters. One of my biggest disappointments is Monomi; Monokuma was cool because he was cynical and sarcastic, but Monomi is like an annoying relative. And if you like the two parts in the first Danganronpa that uses 8-bit graphics, be prepared for even worse graphic EVERYWHERE. I am very disappointed in this game because I loved the first game.

It isn't.This might be hard to convince you of, seeing as how the first game was so good. But I promise you, this game is absolutely terrible. It is NOTHING like the first game. It is actually one of the worst games I have ever played, and easily the worst mystery/visual novel game I have ever played. I tried to like it, I wanted to like it. But I wasted my money on this 60 hour crap-fest. Just read the WIKI or watch the ending on youtube. Trust me.PROS:- The way Mahiru says, ""Jeez""- Nagito mentions the Aussie pop duo, ""The Veronicas"". Remember them?-Ibuki's hair- The graphic update from the first game looks great (the animated backgrounds are a nice touch)CONS:- Obnoxious characters- Complete tonal shift [from the first game]. The setting and the topics it deals with are a goofy, cartoony mess that lacks depth.- Contrived storyline [btw, these are the three most important fundamentals of any novel or work of fiction]- Abysmal pacing [you will spend 30-40 hours before anything meaningful to the overall story takes place]- Unclear game mechanics- Anachronisms- Nonsensical dialogue that is impossible to interpret at times- Sugesstive ""humor"" that isn't particularly clever [it feels a bit like you're watching Beavis and Butthead. Characters will just start talking about their boobs♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥without any motivation and derail the conversation to no comedic effect]- Murder trials that start out goofy and irrational, and progressively deteriorate to the point where jarring contradictions are completely overlooked and never explained [as if the developers just gave up and assumed that the player wouldn't notice or care]- Verbiage, there is no need for about 2/3rds of the game's dialogue. The characters tend to talk cyclically.- One of the worst endings that I have personally experienced. It provides resolutions to most of the story's conflict, but it ultimately leaves the player without fulfillment. You won't walk away from this game with a new perspective on life or anything like that. You'll just be happy that it's over.That's about all I can say without spoiling anything. Overall,this game sacrifices depth and emotion for self-aware, cartoony, ridiculousness. To the very end. When you have a crappy setting/theme, crappy characters, crappy dialogue, and a storyline that forces itself way too hard, you get a crappy novel. You get a crappy game.3/10, it looks pretty and it is generally functional, but I would not recommend it."

In short, skip the game and read the manga or novels.Story:The story is bad until chapter 3 and then it gets interesting. It is the only good part of this game. The bad part of the story is that they try to shoe horn in everyone’s reaction. It is really annoying in the beginning because maybe 2 or 3 are relevant and the other 15 are just noise.Game-play:The game-play is bad. They try to hide it by adding lots of different types of game-play. However, not one single type is decent. The worst part of this game are the games itself. None of them are fun and I found myself trying to rush through them to get back to the dialog. I would have enjoyed this game more if they took them out completely.Art style:There are several different art styles in the game, they should have picked one for two. It is weird. The first person 3D graphics of this game are worse than the original Quake. They should have stuck to 2D.Controls:Saving the game is a crap shoot. You have to finish the mini game to save the game. Sometimes even when the menu is available, it won't let you save the game. This isn't a survival game, I should be able to save the game at any time. In a technical sense, this type of game is easy to write save game files, there is no excuse.Exiting the game takes several steps; it is psychotic. I mean that in the sense that I wouldn’t want to be alone in the same room as anyone who thinks the procedure to quit this game is acceptable."

This is a step in the wrong direction.First, it's a big shift in tone from the last game. There are far more jokes, almost feeling slapstick at times. The fan-service has gone far beyond the innuendo and subtext of the first game. The characters are more silly and less realistic, with a few being totally out of place.There are some good points. Monokuma is still adorably evil and the new bear is a nice addition. There is a new batch of minigames. They have added a few new features I woun't spoil and improved on the slots/store.With the goofy and upbeat tone, I'm having a hard time rooting for the students like I did before. It feels like they made a deliberate change to a new style of game. I'm not done, so maybe there are big mixups or payoffs, but so far it's lost the magic. It feels almost like a comedy spin-off of a dramatic TV show.All toogeather, I'm really missing the despair of the origional. It feels like the biggest strength of the first game was the writing and characters, but now the focus is on the other parts."

I'd give this game around a 5/10 (if we were doing numbers). It functions, quite well actually. But it's aggravatingly so much weaker than its predecessor. If you'll permit me, I'd like to explain why.To PrefaceI've gone through about 35 hours of the first game. I thought it was a great game, despite its flaws. I disliked the ending and it ultimately left me at a low point. but I preordered this one midway through the first game and figured ""what the hell. I'll give this a fair shot."" and try it out.I'll be mostly trying to use comparisons from Trigger Happy Havoc, as that's really the best point to bounce off of. I've gone through the prologue and all of chapter one, ensuring I didn't miss anything in conversations.A Summary for Those GlancingProsThe Main Character is a MASSIVE improvement from the old one.More likable characters in this game than the first.Some new gameplay elements are refreshing.Gameplay encourages exploration but doesn't make it required.ConsStupidity is rampant compared to the first game.Nearly every problematic gameplay element is made worse.Tutorials are pitiful and awkward, and the game seems aware of this for some reason.The unlikable characters are insufferable.Jumps in logic and lack of understanding pad the game's length.GameplayFor those of you looking at the meat of this, thank you!  To summarize for those who have never played these kinds of games before: You will play what seems like a dating sim for a good potion of the game. you get to know these students, develop a rapport, and generally A student will be murdered and you have to investigate a crime scene. collect enough evidence and a trial starts. This is where the game picks up. You'll go through rapid discussions about the case, and find contradictions that you shoot with 'truth bullets'. It's exciting, and a lot of it is left generally intact from the first game.  Now, for the sake of fairness. There are new ideas here I absolutely love. The game has this new feature where, during trials, students will contradict you, and you have to go toe to toe with them, literally cutting through their statements with (sigh) ""truth swords"" until you guide them to the statement you can contradict. It's a refreshing take on the whole idea and adds a dynamic that makes characters more present and gives that 'debate' feel to the whole experience. Not only that, but there are moments where you canconsentwith another student. Agreeing with their statement in an easy to understand mechanic. The sequel even added to the challenge of the game by always having six bullets available to use regardless of difficulty (something I wanted to see more of in the first game). These are great additions that add more complexity to the entire game.Unfortunately, every other gameplay element in the debates has been made worse. Spike acknowledges these problem areas during the tutorials and promises you they've fixed them. I assure, all they've done is taken weak, but ignore-able issues and made them intolerable. I'll explain.Hangman's GambitHangman's Gambit in the first game was a way of filling in a word (usually a singular, partially completed word) by shooting letters flying at the player. It was.... an admirable attempt, but nothing special. Now, the Hangman's Gambit has you floundering as letters attempt to crash into each other at a snails pace, letting you guess a larger, easier to mess up, completely blank phrase. The letters all fly at different speeds, which often leads to them colliding before theyeven reach the screen.you then shoot these letters to combine them for some reason, andthen/add them to the phrase. If you're terrible at this, you'll run into a game over without even guessing wrong. If you're good at this, you'll spend way too much time waiting for letters to populate the screen. Neither scenario is appealing.Closing ArgumentHere, you piece together the entire crime manga style. Filling in missing segments of the story with images you have in your collection. in the first game, It was... admittedly awkward. Often times so many images looked similar, and had no descriptors, so it was hard to piece together what you were trying to do unless you were extremely careful. In this game, the problem is addressed, only to replaced by an entirely different issue. While they take the time to describe what each of the images represent, the phrases are extremely vague. and they only give you five at a time. forcing you to piece together the scene based on what little selection they gave you. I found myself struggling to appease the game's logic in whatever order this was asking for, something I almost never had to do in the first game. And if the player is  struggling to find the answer in a game that revolves around a clear and sensible logic, you are not accomplishing what you set out to do.  Imagine if Monkey Island or Sam and Max had a health bar that drained every time you tried to rub two unrelated objects together. That's an accurate summation of what this mode has become.StoryI'm going to say a phrase here that defines a great deal of games, so bear with me:Stupidity = Plot Convenience. What I mean by this is that characters will go out of their way to do something ridiculous or nonsensical for the sake of adding drama, or making a story work.. A good mystery has all the pieces presented to you and still it is a challenge on how to piece it all together. If you leave out critical pieces of evidence for the sake of adding dramatic tension, it weakens the mystery. There's a lot of trials in both games where a character says .""I found this thing that wasn't important."" halfway through the trial that, in fact, is utterly vital. It doesn't help that character motivations are all the more ludicrious this time around. I'm honestly convinced they have no idea what hope and despair is, because they throw it around like a child discovering a curse word. Possibly the most inexcusable thing is how unlikable several characters are. The first game had plenty of them (oh my god, byakuya) but some of these people are somehow worse. What is aggravating most of all is that if you remove a great deal of the padding, There's not a great deal of story to be had.ConclusionI think what angers me the most about this game is how the game is aware of how terrible some of its writing and gameplay is. It often makes jokes like. ""haha, aren't amnesia plots stupid?"" and then just keeps using it! If you point out a trope and just continue unashamedly, it's just a way of saying. ""I could have done better."" So why didn't you?If a game doesn't care enough to write a better story in a story based game, you could honestly go with better. I really wanted to like this. If you can stomach a weak story, go for it. If not, this game isn't really worth the aggravation."

One minigame is a snowboarding ""Logic Dive"" which feels completely shoehorned in as it doesn't fit any aspect of the game and seems to have been added simply because they thought it was kinda cool.  They've added an ""Improved"" Hangmans Gambit which requires you to guess the answer to a question given no hints on the specific word they want even if you know the answer already.  This is made worse by the fact that as you are trying to determine what the exact word they are looking for is there are multiple letters filling the screen that will crash into each other if you do not actively micromanage them.  Waiting for the correct letter to appear can take 15 seconds or more EACH, multiply that by a 20+ letter answer and you've gone from an interesting back and forth between the characters to managing slowly moving letters for 5+ minutes.   These two games are particularly bad, but the others still add very little to the game.

I'd reccomend starting with Danganronpa 1 though.

Now nearly a 100 hrs clocked in for the sequel, I can safely say it's very solid sequel.Danganropa 2: Goodbye Despair is a light novel mystery game that similar to Phoenix Wright series but has it's own flavor to make it stand out for itself. Similar to the events of the previous game, sixteen students of Hope Peak's Academy are on a vacation trip within an isolated resort known as Jabberwock Island. Things went from a peaceful school trip to a killing school trip when a familiar saboteur known as Monokuma gains control of the island for his new playground of murders. Now playing as Hajime Hinata, you must solve the island's mysteries while surviving the horrors of your classmates killing each other.Story:The story is similar in ways with the previous game but has its own twists and turns that makes it a little different. The player plays as Hajime Hinata, an ordinary high schooler joining a high ranked school known as Hope Peak's Academy. Weirdly, he is awaken with fifteen other students on an tropical island with a magical bunny Usami. Unfortunately, the series mascot Monokuma showed up to make the peaceful school trip to a deadly school trip. Hajime and the other students must find secrets about the island's mysterious nature and solve cases of fallen school mates when a murder occurs.Overall, if you played the first game, you pretty much know what's going to happen. If this your first time, it's going to be quite an emotional trip and adventure with fun and excitement in the mix. There will be a few chapters that are weird, but it tends to even out later in the game. But since this is a pretty decent light novel, the story is well done in this department.Gameplay:For the most part, this game is a standard point and click game with the usage of a controller or mouse (keyboard for some inputs). As the game goes to class trial mode, you'll play a series of mini-games to press on contradictions and lies of classmates' statements and find out who was the mastermind in the case. If you played the first game, most of the mini-games are reworked and some are added on. The Non-stop Debate even has a new feature of agreeing with a classmate statement. For me, additions of Rebuttal Showdown and Logic Dive were pretty good while reworks of Hangman Gambit and M.T.B. (now known as P.T.A.) are sub-par or poor constructed. The bigger culprit for that is the difficulty levels. They were changed to be harder than in the previous game. So Mean in the first game is pretty much Kind in this game.Overall, the gameplay is a decent update to the previous game. The first game was fairly too easy but they beef up the difficulty to make it challenging. There are a few niche updates that I forgot to mention but the game came a long way.Graphics:Since it's a light novel, it'll pretty much display itself like one. At first I wasn't too crazy about it since the characters are literally 2D paper cutouts, but then it was pretty interesting how the areas they visit literally build itself to our view. It's an even more powerful theme to this particular game setting, but a nice touch. Some parts of the game will feature a manga style look, which has really nice art to it. The animations for Monokuma segments are really interesting and dark too. There are some 3D elements to this game as well, but it's still quite weird to me.Overall, it's pretty much what you expect from a light novel look. Nothing outstanding, but something unique and rarely done well.Sound:If there's one thing that both the first game and this game did right is the music. Masafumi Tadaka (you probably know this person dealing with arrangements from Shining Soul series, killer7, No More Heroes, and even Smash Bros.) composes most of the music for this game series. There are returning tracks from the first game, but still have a lot of new tracks in the mix for this game. It fits well for most parts of the game. From calm and relaxing tropical music when the students are trying to enjoy themselves, to the intense rave-like music during class trials of finding the murderer. For the most part of this game, the music fits extremely well to the game and always gets you pumped or despairing at the right moments. Even to the point as you pass more chapters, some songs tend to get stronger along with the cast.Overall, if you like variety of music, this game will greatly accomplished it for you. Tadaka's work was a total surprise for me and he does not disappoint.Overall:Danganropna 2: Goodbye Despair is that rare game that somehow gets me in the right places and I would've never realized it unless my friends influenced me. If there's any alternative mystery games like Phoenix Wright, this is totally it right here. Even the first one is ideal as well. It's even more interesting to say that the game somehow fulfilled a certain kink I loved for a long time. Never expected that at all with this game. But I must say, it's great for its money and I recommend this game very much. But it's best to play it after finishing Danganropa: Trigger Happy Havoc. This game is still good without playing it, but it makes more sense if you played it before this one. But still, totally recommend it."

I mostly dont like listening to the english voice actor of most game because they are terrible at acting, but i got to say, this was beyond acting, it was like the characters were real. So what can i say about this game, hmmm. This is the type of game you HAVE TO read the whole story in order to find what actually happened, unless of course its not your first time. The class trials are really fun, you have to pretend you dont know anything even though you probably guessed who have done it. The ending of this game I definitely love, once you meet the mastermind and stuff, it is great!.One extra tidbit, please make sure to either play the first game or watch the anime version of this. It is highly important you do since a lot of things from the first game is shown on the second, and you will better understand the game.Chiaki for life!"

76561198142755063,Recommended,413420,23173471,"Posted: 23 May, 2016",all,XX,"Holy God this game.I originally bought it for the Vita, but I had to get it once it came out on Steam.You should already be familiar with the basic premise of the story if you've played it's predecessor, Dangan Ronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc. If you haven't played it yet, I strongly suggest playing it before playing Dangan Ronpa 2, because this game holds large spoilers for Dangan Ronpa. And I mean big. Also, some of the things revealed in this game have a bigger effect if you've played the first one.StoryCertainly it's strongest point. You play as Hajime Hinata, a cynical yet good hearted high schooler who is enrolling into Hope's Peak Academy, a school known for only accepting the most talented students across the world. The students are assigned titles as ""Ultimates"" (Super High School Levels in the Japanese version), examples being the Ultimate Mechanic or the Ultimate Swimmer. When Hajime enters the classroom, he immediately knows that something's sketchy. His classmates feel the same way. Suddenly a robotic rabbit plushie reveals herself as the student's teacher, and that they're on a field trip to Jabberwock Island. Cue most of the students freaking out. Just when the students start to enjoy themselves, our previous antagonist Monokuma appears, usurps the teacher's authority, and claims himself to be the headmaster and that from now on you'll have to live on the island forever unless you kill someone and get away with it. But if you're caught, you'll be messily executed. Let's just say things very quickly go south.GameplayIt's generally the same as the first game, except now there are more exploration segments. The gameplay can be compared to Ace Attorney, where the most of it comes from the court sessions.It's split into two modes, Daily Life and Deadly Life. Daily life is exploration and Free Time Events (segments where you can get to know your classmates) while Deadly Life is investigation and trials. That pretty much sums it up.MusicIt's pretty alright. There are some tracks that are pretty damn catchy like the Rebuttal Showdown music. Overall, the music fits the game pretty well.Voice ActingA LOT better than the first game's. Every character's voice fits them perfectly, and you don't need it to grow on you like the first game's voice acting does.Please just buy this game, but make sure to play the first one first.P.S ♥♥♥♥ you Komaeda"

It takes twists and turns you won't remotely expect, and doesn't go by the same rules and conventions as the first game. The class trials are similar, but with the addition of several amazing elements, they're even more fun. My only complaint is that Panic Talk Action replaces Machinegun Talk Battle, and it absolutely sucks. Other than that, I highly recommend it, even at its price (which made me hesitant, but I don't regret paying that much)."

Every person you meet in the game has a unique personality that you either hate or love which makes them kinda realistic in my opinion. The story has the same premise as the first game, while still providing the player new informations about the world that Danganronpa takes place. Also, did I mention the plot twist at the end? What else makes this game awsome? Oh yes, the music. Every song has a vibe which conveys a feeling perfectly matching with the scenes they are paired with. The visuals are also gorgeous, well drawn, and stylish.Overall Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is a fun game with loads of stuff to do (after you finish the game new gamemodes appear), loads of chracters you can love, fantastic storytelling and catchy music, with only one problem of the puzzles sometimes making no sense or somebody being just too anoying.

One of my absolute FAVOURITE series.I have absolutely LOVED this series since I first watched the fan translation of Danganronpa on youtube. Mind you, this was WAY before an official English game was announced.On Danganronpa, I explained my feelings on the anime and English VA. Compared to the cast of DR, I don't mind the VA for DR2. I feel they're much better, but I still much prefer the Japanese VA. There's more emotion put in than the first, but it still just doesn't compare to the Japanese VA.One example is a scene in the first trial. One of the characters has a bit of a psychotic moment, laughing maniacally. Watching the scene in Japanese just blew me away.  The moment I watched the same scene, but in English, I felt so... underwhelmed. They just... sounded like they were trying to laugh with a sore throat. It just... I couldn't continue.Yet again, as much as I love this game, the downfall for me is the English voices. And I believe, even if you LOVE the English VA, the Japanese VA is a MUST, even just once.TL;DROne of my FAVOURITE games.Slightly better English VA than before.Don't like the English VA?

For every trial I thought I knew who the killer was, but I turned out to be wrong for all but one of them. As for the story it was unexpectedly of the highest quality, it contained crazy yet reasonable plot twists and dark yet meaningful themes. The characters were very well developed and I found myself being attached to many of them which made things quite emotional for me as this is obviously a game where many people die. Despite the tragic content of the game, I found that the inclusion of humor helped supplement my desire to play it even more as it added more diversity too it. After I finished I even found myself desperate to find more danganropa content. I watched the new danganropa anime and spent hours trying to find info on the new game that is to be released in january 2017 on ps4 in Japan.

And, really, this game does both of those well.The characters in this game are (almost) all better than the first game's cast (my avatar may give an indicator as to potential exceptions), and this makes up for the story not being quite as good. Where the first game had people concentrating on trying to get out of their enclosed space, this one is focussing on them trying to figure out who among them is a traitor. As such the narrative really revolves around the character interactions a lot more, which isn't a problem because the characters are all that much better, but it leads to moments of frustration when none of them are trying to figure out an escape.In between the trials, investigations, and compulsory narrative, you get to spend your time talking to whichever characters you want to. This really brings out the depth in all the characters, but because of everyone's poor survival chances, it makes the game harder to deal with. Especially when in two consecutive chapters they killed off my four favourite characters. And they become your favourite because you spent gametime with them that could've been spent with anyone else, and now they're gone. Though, like the first game, the postgame is quite a nice conclusion despite the torment it put you through.Nominated for the ""I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye"" Award.Honourable mention for being nominated for the ""Whoooaaaaaaa, dude!"" Award, just because of everything.Especially Nagito.Honourable mention for being nominated for the ""Best Use Of A Farm Animal"" Award, because of Usami's trick right near the start actually being clever foreshadowing."

,Recommended,413420,25858144,"Posted: 4 October, 2016",all,Smartnik,"Where do I start with this game..  At first it felt like a thoughtless sequel that attempts to copy the original while trying to make everything bigger and better. You thought some characters in the first game were too exaggerated/comical? Noweverycharacter is a silly caricature. You thought the first story was stupid at times? Now it's completely off the charts and abandons all realism. The world is bigger, there're more trial mini-games and now there're time-wasting mini-games even outside of trials. The murders are even more convoluted and at times don't make any sense whatsoever.  Halfway through the game I was almost ready to leave it unfinished and uninstall it, so frustrated I was with it.But despite all I decided to complete it for the sake of completion. I arrived at the last chapter and suddenly things got interesting again. And then suddenly everything started to make sense. And then suddenly it was 6am because I spent all night playing.Looking back most grievances I've had with the game make complete sense within the story now that I have the big picture. In fact, it's very difficult to view them as grievances at all anymore. Was the twist worth the frustration? It kind of was, the ending was very satisfying. It was probably also partly my fault not to see the twist coming and to just assume that the writers are stupid.That being said, the point about the trials still stands. A couple of cases don't make a lot of sense and have very weird solutions.  The new trial mini-games are also needlessly complicated and aren't very fun.But it's hardly a deal breaker. The game is still good."

I try to play games from every genre so I can discover new game elements that I really enjoy, and therefore better determine which games I should and shouldn't buy. While I have enjoyed playing visual novel games in the past, they've never really left me feeling too impressed. My problem with the genresis that you can often just watch a walkthough of these games and get pretty much the same experience since they tend to be entirely plot driven with little, if any, gameplay. However, I quickly discovered that Danganronpa is nothing like most visual novels.So you might be thinking, ""There's no way a game where you mostly read text can have good gameplay!.""Well then, ALLOW ME TO CUT THROUGH THOSE WORDS.The gameplay features exploration, searching for clues, literally shooting the words out of peoples mouths, and praying to every god to spare the lives of your favorite characters (Side Note: If you play strategy games, don't expect any help from RNGesus). The main gameplay takes place during the Trials. Here, you use your own logic to prove or disprove your classmates assertations, figure out how the clues you've gathered fit together, and determine truth behind each murder. The game also has a variety of minigames with each trial that require a mix between logic and some skill to complete. While the trial can get difficult at times, the game offers three difficulty settings for both the minigames and the trials; appealling to players that would prefer to progress through the story or, alternatively, overcome despair through an incredible challenge.""Well, if the developer's put this much effort into the gameplay, then the story must not be that great.""NO, THAT'S WRONG!!!The story-telling in this game is beyond compare (except, to it's predecessor). The story in this game will put you on an emotional rollercoaster. The whole time you will be filled with suspense, heartbreak, excitement, depression, fear, anxiety, and determination. All while being caught in a tug-of-war between hope and despair.""But a game's plot is never enough, unless the characters are also great!""I AGREE WITH THAT!Which is each and every character in this game are so well developed. As progress through the game and learn more to about each of them, you'll slowly find yourself emotionally attached to them. I'd say be careful not to get too attached like every other reviewer will tell you, but the reality is, you won't have choice. And honestly, befriending and becoming close to characters in this game is arguably the best part about it. It sucks when you lose your favorite character, but it makes you that much happier when they survive. And even when they do die, you come to appreciate the impact they had on you, and you become determined to keep moving forward for thier sake.""WOW THIS GAMES SOUNDS AMAZING NOW! But how do I know that this game is really worth spending my money on?""I CAN PROVE IT WITH THIS!You've already read this far into my review. If you didn't think you would buy this game this game, you would have ignored this review because of how long it was and looked at the really funny reviews instead. Clearly, you're too interested to not play this game.(Side Note: If you haven't already, make sure you play the first game before this one. While I personally think this one has better gameplay and a much storyline, you'll enjoy it even more if you play through the first game. And if you have played the first game, why are you reading this review. You should playing this game right now.)Now stop reading this and press that ""Add to Cart button"". DO IT. DO IT FOR HOPE."

So, Lesson number one, this series is freaking awesome and everyone should go check it out. There. Class dismissed.Well, okay, real review. I don't have the first game on steam. I sometimes tell people I played it on the PS Vita so then they don't judge me, but really I just watched it on youtube. But then I found out how amazing it was and I just had to experience the second game myself. Besides, I don't even have a Vita.Anyways, let's get some stuff out of the way right now. If you hate games that are story-driven, requires lots of logic, and take a long time, this series will NOT be for you. The writing is fantastic, but if you aren't in it for the long haul, you might not want to even bother with it. Although, if you aren't sure, maybe watch the prologue or something on youtube, just a TINY bit, and see if you are interested. Also,PLAY THE FIRST GAME BEFORE THIS ONE PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD AND SACRED. This one spoils EVERYTHING from the first. And speaking of spoilers, DONT LOOK UP ANYTHING AT ALL. NOTHING. ONLY GO TO THE STORE PAGE AND BUY IT, THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO DO.That said, I will try to say things that will apply to BOTH games, because they are similar and both awesome.So what's the premise? Well, I'll just tell you what happens in the prologue because, let's be real, that's not at all spoiler territory. So there's this place called Hopes Peak Academy, and if something graduates from there, they are basically set for life, but they need to meet 2 qualifications.1.) Be currently enrolled in high school2.) Be they very best at what you do, and become an ""Ultimate"". For example, if you are amazing at singing, you would be invited as the ""Ultimate Singer"", or if you have a sexy as all hell accent, you would be the ""Ultimate Sexy Accent"".So anyways, you play as Generic Anime Protaganist, but under different names depending on if it's the first or second game, and they were just invited to Hopes peak Academy. However, spooky things happen, and you wake up at a mysterious place and meet all of your classmates, aka the other characters, who all range from literally insane, to pervert, to hellspawn, to the resident cute shy girl who is literally best girl. And then the mascot character shows up and is like ""If you want to leave, you need to murder one of your classmates and get away with it"", thus steering the series into the murder mystery genre.So, without spoilers, how is the story? It's fantastic. It's the main draw of this series. All of these things happening all the side and the mysteries of the main plot building up and then they get solved anD ILOJFDNDJRFEWHFD IT'S GREAT. The story also has a lot of emphasis on that characters, and all of them are great. Not all of them are LIKEABLE, but they are all written well. And you will find yourself getting attached to certain characters as they contribute to the story and then eventually they probably got freaking killed. Oh, and don't be fooled, people WILL die. And some deaths may hit you VERY hard, particularly if it's one of your favorites. But don't worry, it's all a part of the danganronpa experience.The murder mystery parts are also very well written. Figuring out ""whodunnit"" is always interesting, and the further you go in the more complicated it gets. Which is another reason to start with the first game, IT'S SO MUCH EASIER TO FIGURE OUT. It's more like a warm-up for the second. While some of the trials have some details that could made me mad, but overall it's pretty great.So how's the gameplay? It's pretty good. 1/3 of it is a visual novel, moving along in the story and going from place to place to trigger the next event in the story. 1/3 is a dating sim, where you spend free time with the currently surviving characters and give them presents, and if you give them something the actually like by reading item description and paying attention to the characters, you get little events that tell you more about them. And then the last 1/3 of it is a murder mystery, where a murder happens, and you need to look around and gather evidence, and then go to a trial and use it to solve the case. The gameplay helps you feel like you are getting closer to the characters and solving the mysteries yourself, and it's cool.As for other important stuff, the soundtrack is pretty great. There are a few tracks that I just can't get out of my head sometimes. And also, the voice acting for both the English and Japanese is pretty solid. Also, yes, you can have English text and Japanese voices if you prefer, and apparently the Japanese cast has some very, VERY well known people. Like, one person in the second game is voiced by the same person who did the japanese voice for, ah, let's see here, Edward Elric from Fullmetal Alchemist, Temari from Naruto, Finn from Adventure Time, freaking PHARAH FROM OVERWATCH, need I go on?So, you may be thinking, ""This jumbled wall of text is nice and everything, but what's so amazing about it?"" Well, it's really hard to truly put it into my words, but the writing just engrosses you. It wraps you up in a ball and it won't let you go until you know what happens. Between the characters, and the mystery, and just the foreshadowing dropped here and there and it's just DOJSHNEFJDVKOGBKLE; IT'S JUST FREAKING GREAT. I've been OBSESSED with this series every since I heard about it. And now is an EXCELLENT time to hop on the bandwagon, with the TWO ANIMES that are CURRENTLY AIRING. One is the VERY END, and one is the VERY BEGINNING. But just like the other things, DON'T WATCH THESE UNTIL YOU HAVE FINISHED THE FIRST AND SECOND GAME.I'm using all caps a lot and this is very long because I'm VERY passionate about this series. IT'S SOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOD 10 OUT OF FREAKING 10 GO BUY THE FIRST GAME NOW. Well okay MAYBE wait until it's on sale but GET IT SOON IF YOU CAN IT'S JUST SO FREAKING AMAZING."

Some of the songs are so good you might even want to get them on your phone or something.Story-This has the best story of any game I've ever played. You will be be sad enough that you want to cry. You will be exited enough that you start to dance in your chair. You will not expect most of the twists that happen in this game. You constantly be intrigued by the story that you will get lost in the game. You'll start up the game at 8:00 PM and then realize that's it 6:00 AM once you finally feel like turning your head away from the screen.Characters-The characters in this game have such great design that you will develop relationships with these characters that you will cherish, too bad you'll feel much of the despair the game promises when they die though.Puzzles-The puzzles in this game aren't to hard, but they aren't too easy either. They give you a perfect balance between the two. The minigames that are played for this are very well designed (Hangman's Gambit may be a bit controversial) that they are fun, and also make sense in there situation.Voice Acting-It is absolutely amazing with some of the best voice actors out there such as Fukuyama Jun and Sugita Tomokazu; however, I can't stand the english voice acting so I highly, highly recommend the Japanese voice acting.Art-Art is very well done which helps you totally capture the distress or happiness a character is feeling, or perhaps the creepy ambiance of a location.Ending-One of the best endings I've seen. That's all I'm saying.Cons:-Look sensitivity while walking around is too low.-Contains an unnecessary amount of saliva and snot (not a serious con)Overall review:BUY THIS GAME! At a $30 price tag you have no reason not to buy this game. However, I highly recommend you play the first game before you jump into this game as you'd be very lost to what's going on."

If you're a new player, start with the first game, then move on to this when you're done playing the first game and enjoying it.If you played the first game and didn't enjoy it, I guess you must be the sort of person who dislikes fun.

Because of this, Danganronpa 2 can feel ""overdone"" at times. It is like eating your favorite blueberry pancake but with even more pancake and even more blueberries. It's going to feel like a chore, but only if you compare it to the first game.My advice is to avoid comparing anything. You are better off letting this game build upon the brilliance of the first.

The mini-game that used to be like DDR felt like it was off-sync so that one might just be a port problem.You know that feeling of regret when you wished you got to know a character more before they died? GET USED TO IT.Soundtrack was almost identical to the original, and the story was enjoyable as well.Bonus features include Island Mode, which is pretty much the same as the School Mode in the original where you can catch up with your classmates without having to worry about them dying.

The mysteries were harder in comparison to the first game, but I played both the first and second on the hardest modes for both action and logic. I highly recommend this game, for it's a bit more than just a visual novel.

I love the story and the mechanics too.But in all seriousness i'll give you a rundown of my thoughts for the game.1. Amazing storyline with many twists, turns and shocks that are going to leave you on the edge of your seat.2.At first, unless you've played the previous game, the trials will prove to be quite difficult, especially on the rebuttalinstances. The game will get much easier after you get used to the controls and how to play the game.3. I recomend you play the first game or watch the anime first before you play this game.4.There is a LOT of reading to do. When i say a lot, i mean, a lot. Unfortunately this is one of the reasons i got bored in certain parts of the game, The storyline is completely worth all of your spent time reading the dialogue.5. After you complete the game, there is still more to do. You not only get a whole story,which ties into the first one, it's pretty exclusive, beware though, unlike the main story, its all just reading, no artwork or people to look at other than the background. You get several other games to play as well, along with artwork of all the characters, music and a cutscene theater. Of course these cost monokoins(in game currency that you can get through doing certain things throughout the game.)6, Finally the characters. One of the greatest things about this game is the diverse characters and their personalities. Not to long after starting the game i got attached to the characters and enjoyed seeing them interact with each other. Each one has a unique personality and are all different, from the weird, to the funny. or from the completely physchotic to the outright annoying.I will definitely replay this game soon, on a harder difficulty that is.I personally recommend this game to anyone who is wanting a game that has a great story and is guaranteed to keep you entertained."
,Recommended,413420,29050555,Posted: 5 January,all,Ehn Jee,"A great sequel to the first game. The basic premise is the same as the first, but it intorduces a whole new set of characters (which are even more eccentric), provides more gameplay variety in the trials with new mechanics, has better designed trials with more depth than the previous game, and even more awesome music. It's essentially more of the same, so there's plenty for fans to enjoy, but likely won't convert anyone who didnt like the other game. As I'm drawing many comparisons to the first game, you definitely want to play is before diving into this one. It's a new cast of characters, but there's definitely connections to be made.I can't recommend this franchise enough if you can tolerate the puzzle/visual novel gameplay and anime style. The writing is top notch, the story remains compelling, and it has a great mix of emotions thoughout."
,Recommended,413420,29077764,Posted: 6 January,all,yoda473,"Danganronpa 2 is one of the few sequels to be better than the original. The art style is unique and the music is atmospheric. On the other hand, the voice acting is lazy and the sound effects are generic. The end is mind-blowing, far more so than Trigger Happy Havoc, but still wraps everything up nicely and even manages to throw in some emotion. Unlike the first game, it actually matters when someone dies and characters don't instantly move on when their best friends are killed. It's not as good unless you've played the first game, but still works fine by itself. If you're an established fan of the franchise or a newbie, I certainly recommend this game."

A little fast paced, but it was not like how the anime rushed it. With this in mind, I was curious on what more there was of the series. Low and behold, I found the sequel. Honestly, I lowered my expectations when I purchased it. I considered the sequel may be inconsistent to the storyline, become dull in comparison to the first game, and I would chuck it in my library to never see the light of day, buried alongside a handful of visual novels covered by my crippling disappointment.Holy crap, was I wrong about that assumption.This was actually a really awesome game. I was beside myself by how invigorating all the concepts and development turned out to be. I wondered if the characters would be watered down by the large casting, but there was honestly a lot of thought put behind them. They had minor roles, but not enough to not make them at least somewhat interesting. Each had a quirk of their own, making them all lovable.Oh, and did I mention there is a Yakuza boss with a Napoleon Complex?... That's just hilarious. XDHere's a quick rundown of what to expect:~Story mode~Consists of:-Doki doki moments-You're on a beach! Splash around to your heart's content! (Wtf?)-The talking maniacal teddy bear returns-Double the trouble with a fluffy version of that maniacal bear-Fuyuhiko Kuzuryuu-Moments when everyone questions their sanity-In turn, you question your own sanity on purchasing the sequel. You wonder why you would ever think the story could not become more traumatizing. Was it worth paying this much-Hey, midget yakuza boss. Cool.-Fuyuhiko Kuzuryuu~Free Time~Consists of:-Quality time with the husbando or waifu of your choice-Cheating is not applicable-Obtain your own harem as fast as possible-Don't leave behind your personal Fuyuhiko Kuzuryuu-Hope your waifus don't end their laifus-You have the opportunity to create beautiful bromances with the men of your choice-Put on your yaoi goggles for one choice in particular...-It's basically Pokemon: We ""gotta catch 'em all""~Trial Mode~Consists of:-Epic rip off ""Objections"" like the first game-Interesting mechanics with ear splitting gunshots-Constant argumentative characters all up in your grill-Fuyuhiko Kuzuryuu will be the most notable nemesis-You will be overwhelmed by the ""tsun tsun"" train of Fuyuhiko Kuzuryuu-Fuyuhiko Kuzuryuu achieves the title of ""most consistent pain in the♥♥♥♥♥edgelord""-You will find this strangely endearing-If all else fails, find ways to counteract characters being all up in your grill-You can play Hangman-Surf the deep web of your mind-Hysterical teens-Rainbow button mashing while 1v1ing hysterical teens-Feel like you're taking a trip through Caramelldansen town all over againHusbando/Waifu potential?

It has the same dark bizarre humor and over the top characters, and clever murders. Although honestly I found the humor could be a little obnoxious at times as opposed to bizarely amusing, which wasn't a problem I had with the first game.The gameplay adds a couple new elements, but gameplay is still obviously not the main point of the game, the main draw is solving the murders, particularly putting together small clues to form the whole picture, and of course, plot twists! There are very clever and intriguing mysteries in this game, and a couple I didn't even begin to figure out until the middle of the class trialThere are two main criticisms I have with this game, 1. There were a couple times where I knew the answer or clue I needed to trigger the next section of a trial, but the wording sequence needed in game was very counter intuitive. There were definetly times where the trial mini games just felt like chores2. This was a criticism I also had for the first game: You can build relationships with characters, but those relationships don't matter. They don't make any difference when it came to the trials or the overall plot. It would have added so much more depth to the game and the characters if characters could decide to help or hinder your clue gathering based on how close you were to them. I was very disapointed that the developers chose not to add any more depth to this part of the gameOverall I enjoyed Danganronpa 2, and if you enjoy mysteries and story driven games with very morbid off the wall humor, you likely will too"

Danganronpa 2 however, is the bomb. In terms of difficulty and gameplay mechanics, it continues right from the end of Danganronpa; seriously, the first trial in this is way harder than anything in Danganronpa, and some of the story twists rely on you having played Danganronpa, so absolutely do not start the series here. The greatest improvement without a doubt is the murders; where in Danganronpa they were usually pretty easy to figure out, almost every murder in this one is one total mindscrew followed by another. The cast of characters in this one is also much more likable in this one, Nagito Komaeda being one of my favorite characters in any VN, period.If there's one gripe I have about it, it's the fact that 1. It's still filled to the brim with tired anime tropes and 2. The ending is garbage, once again. That being said, neither of those were any where near enough to sour my opinion of this game/VN."

Would I recommend this to everyone? No. I would suggest this game to those who loved the first so much that they are eager to delve deeper into the twisted universe of the evil teddy bears. Delightfully, there are extra bonuses in the sequel that really help to construct a complete world full of subplots, secondary characters, and delightful twists and turns within a plot that is original despite the clear spinoff qualities of a sequel.Four Stars"
76561198052178797,Recommended,413420,29043543,Posted: 5 January,all,vimbert,"Danganronpa is something of a mixed bag of different mini-games and modes, so I find it a little too weird to write about it as a whole. I'll split this into chunks:Story: The main story is a mildly interesting framing device explaining why so many different people (from a jerk of a little girl dancer to a trenchcoat-wearing man who speaks of how evil he is and is utterly devoted to his Four Dark Devas of Destruction-his pet hamsters) have been brought together to try to kill each other to escape. The story reuses some general themes and devices from the first game, and although there's something of a justification in some later-game twists, I would have rather they came up with something more original. The story really shines when it comes to each murder mystery, however; I have never seen mysteries written this well in a game. Even when the answer is obvious, it's usually a trap or things aren't quite what they seem. Attentive players can pick up on some of these thanks to choice foreshadowing and less obvious clues, but plenty caught my trope-overdosed brain by surprise.Gameplay: Gameplay consists two parts: visual novel/investigation segments, with standard ""talk to NPCs, find clues, etc"" that anyone who's played a game in this genre should be familiar with. I have little to say about this save that it's straightforward and doesn't waste your time with much backtracking or pixel hunting for clues. And then there are the trials, the other half of the gameplay, which consist of a mixed bag of mini-games and logic puzzles to determine who killed the latest victim, and these range from excellent (Nonstop Debate) to inexcusible (Panic Talk Action) to perfect in every way (Closing Argument). On the whole, they make for an enjoyable experience, and I have to say no game like this has given me quite the sense of accomplishment that Danganronpa 2 gives when you piece every little bit of the case together and lay every mystery bare to shove it right in the villain's face, all to haunting yet upbeat music.Sound: Voice acting is on point here, even in the dub. Special mention should go to the VAs for Gundham, Nagito, and (SPOILER) for really owning the characters and going the extra mile to drive home the lines. I usually skip ahead in games like this because I read much faster than the characters speak, but I found myself often letting the lines play out with the game's Auto mode. The music is also fantastic, suiting the mood from calm exploration to tense interrogation.Extras: There's a surprising amount of unlockable content the game hands to you. There's the expected art and sound gallery, along with cutscene theater. However, the game has a few side stories that are completely optional, some of which don't relate to the game at all and expand on the greater universe of the franchise. Unfortunately, these to me felt unimpressive and lackluster compared to how tight and rewarding the base game feels. Although, being able to get everyone's visual novel sections was appreciated.On the whole, this game is well worth your money for the core experience. If you like solving mysteries and can roll with the game changing up gameplay with some action in your sleuthing, this game will be absolutely perfect for you. Highly recommended for any fan of murder mysteries."

If you look at my first review 13.4 hrs in is about 3/4's into the game, if you know what your doing.  Where as 21 hrs in is only alittle more than 1/2 way in.  This game is a time sink, it takes a commitment of your paitience and tolerence if you want to beat it.  You also better like to read, because you will be doing a lot of that.

76561198326164499,Recommended,413420,31069925,Posted: 10 April,all,Billuminati Dorito,"Where do I begin?Personally, I think this game is a masterpiece. After watching Danganronpa The Animation and got into this crazy fandom, I thought it was aight. But after seeing the games for the first time, I was simply blown away. Unfortunately, I didn't get the joy of playing it blind since I watched a playthrough of DR2 before I played it (NicoB, btw). But the fact that I got so many good reactions out of just sitting and watching sold me on this game and instantly made it my favourite.Enough backstory tho. Let's talk about the things that this game does well.-Characters-For a game where you know way more than half the characters are gonna die, the characters here are really well made. I will admit, some more so than others. Now I could spend hours talking about all the characters and why I love or hate them, but for the sake of your potential uninterest, I won't. We'll cover this quickly.The character variety in this game is pretty damn neat. There are some easy to love, and some easy to hate, and some you're not quite sure. And although there is only one character here that I hate, that's not a bad thing at all. I don't hate him because I think he's a bad character. Far from it. I hate him because his character was designed to be hateable. This goes to show that they did a good job at making this character. But at the same time, I know a lot of people who love him, so there's a lot of different ways that you can interpret each character, which I think is really nice and it helps keep the fandom alive. Of course no one's gonna agree. My favourite might be someone else's hated Mary Sue. And of course you won't get to know each character fully in the main story because they'll die before you get to. Luckily, there's a bonus mode after you complete the main story that lets you do so. And, trust me, you'll most likely get very attached to at least one of them. Just hope that they don't end up dead.-Plot-Much like the first game, the plot in this game rarely, if not ever fails to go into the perfect amount of detail. And at the same time, it leaves a lot of mystery. It's a really good balance of the two. This doesn't just go for the overall plot, but for each individual trial too. Admittedly, some have more questions left to answer than others, but that doesn't mean any of them are bad.As for the overall plot, everything just seems to fit together so well, and that includes some details from the first game. It truly succeeds as a sequel by developing the series more and more with each chapter, and bringing it all together for what would have to be my favourite finale in any video game. And yet there's still more. But let's not get off track by talking about the other games.-Challenge-Now, if we're talking about this like it's an action game, I can't say that it has a huge difficulty level...or even a relatively high one for that matter. Rather than being challenging on the hands controlling it, it's challenging on the mind. It took me a while to figure out some of the solutions to some of the cases, but the feeling of satisfaction when you finally get it is awesome. There are a few minigames that require some action gameplay, and they can get quite difficult. Sometimes not because it's meant to be. But I'm not gonna sit here and tell you that this game is flawless. Luckily, you can set difficulty between 3 levels with both action and logic.-Follow Up-As I've already said, this game really succeeds as a sequel. I feel like it does almost everything better than the first game. The plot is more interesting, the characters are better, the trials are longer and more engaging, etc. Although this is the case, it is really worth playing the first game first if you're worried about spoilers.-Waifus-Okay, let's be real for a second. This game...no, this series as a whole has some great ♥♥♥♥in' waifus. Like oh my god. Like I can name 5, maybe 6 from this game alone. Sure, it's a silly point to make and coud've easily gone in the Characters section, but my bebs deserve more.Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is my favourite game of all time as of right now. And I don't think I'll be finding anything better any time soon. This game will keep you occupied for hours whether you're just in it for the plot or if you're an achievement hunter.And as I've said, it's not perfect. I definitely has flaws. But the good points outnumber the bad points by a landslide.For £23, this game is definitely worth the purchase, and that's true for whatever currency you might be using too.10/10Would murder my friends again.Chiaki is best girl, don't argue."

This game proves those skeptics wrong in a MULTITUDE OF WAYS!For those of you who've already played Trigger Happy Havoc, you should have a general idea of what Goodbye Despair is about: Students at the upper-tier Hope's Peak Academy are forced into a Killing Game, where victory is only possible if you kill one of your classmates and not get caught. The difference here? You're on an archipelago called Jabberwock Island, there's a rabbit version of Monokuma that's more obsessed with Hope than Despair, and things got a little bit MORE complicated in terms of gameplay... And all of this is wonderful.Like the previous game, gameplay is split between three main segments: Daily Life, Deadly Life, and the Class Trial. Daily Life and Deadly Life are more-or-less the same as in Trigger Happy Havoc, however the new mechanic of Hope Fragments as a form of currency to buy skills for the Class Trials AND the addition of the Level System allows for some more diversity than just talking to someone and hope you get either a good skill or a boost to your PP limit.Class Trials have kept their normal finding the contradictions, hangman's gambit, Bullet-Time-Battle (now called Panic-Talk-Action) and the Closing Argument Recap, but a few newer events appear, alongside revamped versions of previous events: Including the Rebuttal Battle (engage in one-on-one arguments with your classmates to cut through their beliefs with your blades of truth) and the Logic Dive (an obstacle course-like trial in which you evade various obstacles to solve the trickier questions). The new additions, as well as the old spins on the classics, are a welcome bunch to the hectic and dramatic Class Trials.Lastly, but CERTAINLY not least, the characters are phenomenal. While the Trigger Happy Havoc cast were enjoyable, many of them fell into character archetype pitfalls that made them feel predictable. The Goodbye Despair cast, although also being archetypes themselves, feel even more real than compared to the previous cast, each one bringing something new to the table that you probably wouldn't expect, including a few surprising choices like the Ultimate Yakuza and even a returning face nobody really expected (and surprisingly thought they wanted). Of course, Monokuma is in full-swing, and as much as he is a despicable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a bear, he's still too much fun, especially when using his little sister Monomi as a foil.My review wouldn't do this game justice, all I can say is that Goodbye Despair is definitely a must-buy for anyone who enjoys mystery, comedy, and above all, enjoyed Trigger Happy Havoc. So, I give this game a 9/10 ""Must Play"" recommendation, and hope you all give it a play.Otherwise Monokuma has a very special Punishment prepaired just for you! Puhuhuhuhuhu!!!"

I also prefer the new monokuma coins system (the way I play games, it really slowed me down to click on every single thing to find coins in the first game) and earning coins through raising pets. And the game play during the trials is more challenging & interesting. My personal favorite is the logic dive, while I sucked at Hangman's Gambit and found it annoying.Play it!"

That's why I loved the first Danganronpa game as it fufilled that and even more, but Danganronpa 2 takes what the first game built on a takes to a whole new level of despair and hope. I honestly never really expected for a PS Vita game to make to the Steam store, let alone for it to one the best ports out there as you can hardly tell that it was originally on another game system, unlike some ports. COUGH! COUGH! Tale of Symphonia. COUGH! COUGH! This game is great for those who love game like Ace Attorney, but want a little more than a visual novel with no gameplay mechanics that couldn't be done by a 3 legged turtle. It's also nice that it has a difficultly setting so you do not have to worry about being too stupid or not being able to use logic like you want to, and before you say I'm calling anyone except myself an idiot, I am directing this comment at myself. I can be very stupid at times and an essential idiot handicap is almost always appericiated with me because I do not know when my moments of sheer ""why isn't my brain thinking the bestest"" will happen. Now while it is not necessary to play the first game and be able to understand this game's story, I would highly recommend playing the first game before this one as it will make the storyline the last few chapters a LOT more clearer. Playing the first game is also a good way to understand if you really will like this game as the game mechanics are a bit easier to learn and you'll get an idea of what you're getting into by the end of the first trial. It's really incredible though because *insert spoiler here*! Overall, if you're looking for a good visual style novel to get into on your day off or you'd like something that'll make you question the state of the world and why aren't you doing anything about in the wee hours of the night, then Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair (and goodbye any peaceful dreams after beating it) is your horror story to play through!"

THE FIRST GAME IS VIRTUALLY MANDATORY in terms of narrative, so pick that up first.PROS:+Great characters, with plenty of potential waifus - just don't get too attached. One character who started as a total A-hole turns out to be one of the biggest bros as time goes on.+Plot makes twists and turns at varying levels of 'bonkers', and at a constant high of despair.+Incredible blend of Persona and Phoenix Wright, as written by George RR Martin (not really, but the way characters die...)+Investigations and trials are compelling, with surprising turns that change how you look at a character you THOUGHT you knew.CONS:-As is usually the case in games like Phoenix Wright, there's a specific chain of logic you have to follow in trials; it can be frustrating to understand where the plot's going but not know how to progress. Which piece of evidence do I present? Who do I accuse?-Get ready for LOTS of reading - but considering half of this game is a visual novel, that's par for the course.-So many dead waifus... :("

But, this sequel brings something quite essential about what happened before and during the first game : How the world ended, why etc ... I will let you discover that :P2) Atmosphere :Unlike the Despair dimension in the first one, we have a different approach of the killing game here and for other reasons.It was really interesting that it was inside a game and to restore the Ultimate Despair itself !Here, it's on an island and kind of open, it was somehow refreshing compared to this creepy school o_O There's a paradox between the murders and the ""vacation"" ambiance of Jabberwock Island. An other way to make things awful x)3) Lack of charismatic people :Concerning the characters, they were mainly boring :/ The only decent characters were Ibuki, Nekomaru, Nagito, Gundham and Fuyuhiko ... Where are Byakuya / Naegi / Kyoko / Sakura / Mukuro / Genocide Jack and all x) I was excited when people likeMikanorTeruteruwere killed, they were annoying !!4) Verdict :Overall, the game was surprisingly well orchestred and I wanted to know what would happen after each class trial :) All we need now is to have Danganronpa 3 on Steam for the conclusion of this masterpiece story made by our fellow Spike Chunsoft !! :D"

Island mode can be really tedious after a while as you do over and over again to get the few acheivments surrounding island mode. Magical Miracle Girl Mode is to be honest a pain as one acheivement makes you get all the equipment which will take ages as well my luck was horrible. There is also this horrible glitch when you into momomi you screen is covered with pink and white lines. The light novel included in the game was enjoyable as I have played the previous game and sometimes rememeber some things in the previous game. But the light novel is a bit long as a event is at the end of the novel. You have to click for long time just read the end and then if you were  like me I read the light novel after. The leveling up of lvl to 99 takes patience and the power to hold the Shift and <- -> while you kill plenty of your virtual pet. The game is better then Danganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc as many things has improved as the graphic are better. The first murder was way better than the previous game first murder, To old players: Danganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc first murder were so obvious that most hit our heads on the table.

,Recommended,413420,34867736,Posted: 10 September,all,TwiliSailor,"Danganronpa 2 at first glance can seem like more of the same. Unlike in the original the first chapter of this second entry doesn't quite hit the same high notes. But rather it begins a deceptive mystery that becomes more complex as the story progresses. For anyone who is unsure after the first two hours. Stick with this game and you will experience a masterful sequel, that brings so much depth to the original story. These two games were made to be played together.The trial system has been given quite an overhaul. You can now agree with other characters and also perform a logic dive action sequence. This adds some good action and logic puzzles. Hangman's Gambit is... not exactly better but it is different and a little bit harder if nothing else. Some decisions during the investigation and free time segements will seem a bit strange at first (Such as the sidescrolling travel between areas); But considering the games almost doubled length and scope when compared to the original, these additions become very welcome.The characters are charming, there's so much life in each of them that even the first ones to go will be easily remembered throughout the 40 ish hour adventure. Despite a slightly weak start Danganronpa 2 is an amazing game. Does it top the original? In some ways yes and in some not exactly. But even the slight issues here and there can be overlooked for the wealth of content it brings. If you've played the first one, you need to play this one. It's absolutely worth your time."
,Recommended,413420,33733102,Posted: 22 July,all,Sad Richard,"Let me start by saying I almost never write reviews so sorry if this sucks.I was hesitant to buy Danganronpa 2 (even at half price) despite loving the first installment in the series. After finally convincing myself, I was slightly disappointed with first half an hour of gameplay due to the slow start and easily dislikable characters. You don't have to play the original to understand and enjoy the game, but it'll make you appreciate both games a lot more. The majority of the characters struck me as annoying and two dimensional when the game began, but as I progressed even my least favorites didn't seem too bad. A major improvement that was made in comparison to the original is the minigames ranging from pets, to trial features, to Magical Miracle Girl Monami (which reminded me of Sakura's Revenge). The movement to different locations and new hangman's gambit seemed a little clunky at first, but became more enjoyable as you adapt to them. Overall, Danganronpa 2 felt harder than the first in terms of finding the indentity of the killers and proving it in the class trial (due to occasionally confusing  nonstop debates and sometimes outrageous inferences). While originally skeptical about whether Danganronpa 2 would be worth the money and live up to the first, I quickly realized it would live up to expectations and would even consider buying at full price."

The series has improved so much since the first game! I can't wait to see what happens with the upcomingDanganronpa V3: Killing Harmony.General words of advice: You can play with both keyboard and gamepad controls. I didn't find gamepad to be needed for myself until the latter half of the game's trials in a segment called ""Logic Dive"". Forget the ""(Improved) Hangman's Gambit"", the real hell of game mechanics is ""Logic Dive"" by far.

Nevertheless, I enjoyed DR2.  It's dark and wacky.  The mysteries were very intricate and a lot of attention was put into the details of each case.  The game is far from perfect, though.  My biggest complaint is with the dialogue.  Too many times characters love to point out the obvious, or they'll outright explain jokes immediately after the punchline as if to say ""That was a joke!  Did you get it?""  Characters also lack any real depth, and tend to ramble on too long.  Additionally, each court case followed an increasingly predictible pattern (e.g.the first person accused of the crime is always innocent).  Minigames are hit and miss.  I liked Logic Dive and Rebuttal Showdown.  Hangman's Gambit was passable, but Panic Talk Action was really awful.  During nonstop debates, I found that the memorizing a truth bullet mechanic was very underused, which caused frustration when time came to use the mechanic and I had forgotten all about it.  Ah well.So what compelled me to keep playing?  Well, as I said, the mysteries are complex and interesting.  And despite how one-dimensional the characters are, I still found myself enjoying most of their interactions.  It also helps that the story's pacing is done very well.  There's a lot of intrigue, and I loved the morbid humor.  The court cases were actually a much thicker piece of the game than I was expecting, which is a good thing.  Mean Logic difficulty provided a decent challenge, and despite my minor gripes about memorizing truth bullets, the nonstop debates are a lot of fun."

What Spike Chunsoft has done here is incredible; they've created a new batch of characters that might be even more beloved than the ones from the original title. It's an incredible feeling to just spend time getting to know each of them, and seeing how they interact with each other will make you laugh and cry, depending on the occasion.I'll be honest; I'm not a huge fan of some of the new or modified minigames (especially Logic Dive and Panic Talk Action), but the quality is still there. Just keep in mind: if you've played the original game, be prepared for a harsh difficulty spike, even on the easiest settings. Trials are longer, and the puzzles are (generally) much more difficult than the original. On the other hand, he culprit's identity is usually concealed astonishingly well until the end.Danganronpa 2 is filled with fantastic plot twists, homages and subversions of everything that you would expect, and seems to delight in leaning on the 4th Wall, though this ends up making even greater sense later. I would strongly recommend this to anyone, though you should play the original title first to have the necessary context."

,Recommended,413420,34839332,Posted: 9 September,all,Lopper,"Where do I begin? It ofcourse is a sequel to the first game and this time there's students on an island instead of in a school. A lot of stuff didn't make sense at first and it felt more unrealistic and random than the first game however it's all good. I can't say much without spoiling it but trust me it's alright. There's a few more little cool things in this game compared to the first one, for example you can collect monokuma dolls throughout the game which is cool and then the thing where you talk to people to increase friendship with them is improved compared to the first game. There's quite a few new things in there. The graphics are about the same however which is unfortunate but since it was originally a PS Vita game I can't complain much.There's a few problems I have with the game like some of the questions and stuff you need to answer in the trials is quite annoying at times, especially since sometimes it involves you having to remember distinct stuff people said or things about someone that you forgot since that was like 20 hours ago you learned that stuff. Basically the trials are a bit annoying even on gentle difficulty which is a bit of a shame but most of it is alright so its not too bad. The only other problem really is that like you don't get enough time to talk to everyone and unlock the skills, there's over 30 yet you can only talk to people like 30 times throughout the whole game yet you have to talk to each person 6 times so that's way too much, I understand some stuff being for completionists but still, I would have liked to interact with people more since the trials are quite hard and the skills are useful. One other thing is that some of the kills were so outrageously performed I'd be surprised if anyone would be able to figure them out without the games help, a lot of random stuff you wouldn't have ever guessed is quite prevalent unfortunately.Aside from that overall the game is pretty damn good, can't say much more without spoiling it but ofcourse if you've played the first game this is just as good and also a bit longer. I'd give it a good 8/10. Love love."

They took the different modes(hangmans gambit, nonstop debate, etc) and ""improved"" them, some changes i liked while others not so much. they also added new styles like logic dive which was fun and different from the other modes.The story follows a similar path of the first game, while throwing more curve balls and false leads at you. The only difference from the first game story telling wise is that it takes much longer for the story to take the nose dive into the meat of the story.The characters for this game are just as good and more over the top then the first games.Island mode(this games version of school mode) i fell was handled a lot better then the first game, making it more streamlined and faster to complete.The negatives of this game would have to be some of the ""improvements"" and some new modes added to the trials. The Rebuttal showdown and panic talk action modes just dont feel right at all. with the former just not making much sense at times and button masher in essence, and the later just not working timing wise at all. hangmans gambit takes a lot to get used to aswell. I am not a fan at all of the new 2d movement system the game uses in its overworld. I encountered numerous minor graphical annoyances like the background images having floating pixels(as if the artists didnt fully clean the canvas of isolated pixels) and some images going negative when infront of another colour or image, or just outright disappearing. there is also a still of chiaki that has a solid black square on her that is obviously not supposed to be there. I also dont understand why the decided to add monomis island game mode, its just not fun at all and by far the worst part of the game. Though at the end of the day these are all small issues that maybe others wont find annoying and none are game breaking.I fully recommend the game for those who enjoyed the first games story and want more of that."

76561198340092362,Recommended,413420,35037670,Posted: 17 September,all,zha.james266,"I'll be honest, when I first played Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair, I basically knew the entire plot from beginning to end with only minor details left out, because I went directly from the Danganronpa anime to Danganronpa 3. While some parts of the game didn't have as a powerful effect on me as it could've had if I played the game blind, I still thouroughly enjoyed it. The gameplay of DR2 is notable uptake from the original, but I feel that class trials often go on for very long without any gameplay whatsoever. While variation in DR2 is stronger than Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, the number of actual playable segments are just barely increased, which is a problem as trials in this game are almost twice as long than from the first. Nonetheless what really makes DR2 a worthwhile game is the cast. The cast of this game, I would defend, are more unique and interesting than the characters of DR1. Characters like Ibuki, Gundham, Sonia, Chiaki and Nagito were great to have around and even though I knew what would happen to some of the cast, I still felt sadness whenever I came across the murders or executions. Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair is a fantastic visual novel for anyone interested in the murder mystery genre. It rivals the original in enjoyability and expands upon the universe created by the original game."

,Recommended,413420,35364849,Posted: 30 September,all,Chrismas95,"Dangan Ronpa is a series notorious for spoilers. If you’re interested at all in the series, this means that you should definitely start with the first game. Dangan Ronpa 2 more or less is the same game as far as structure and mechanics, so it’s not anything like “The definitive Dangan Ronpa experience” or anything. However, if you’ve already played Dangan Ronpa 1 and are looking to see if this is worth it, well, like I said above, it’s more of the same in a way. So if you liked interacting with characters and going through the steps of investigating a murder and doing a class trial every chapter, then this is an easy buy. Things like the characters and murders may or may not be as good depending on how you feel, but you’re still getting the Dangan Ronpa experience from this one and a plot that hands you off into the next game. If you DIDN’T like Dangan Ronpa 1 and are wondering if this game is different enough for you, then I would say it isn’t and you might be better off without.Before I go into a bit more detail about the game that people who are super spoiler-sensitive may worry about, I think it’s important to note that each chapter took me ~7 hours (the Prologue took 2 hours), with the trials themselves taking 2 hours because I would let the narration play. I say, for remembering what happened during investigations, the best way to play is spend an hour or two exploring the new area and doing free time, then take a break, then return to do the rest of the chapter. Doing it all in one go was pretty draining after a while. Otherwise, the main game took me 39 hours to complete, with the post-game Dangan Island (to get all of the Hope Fragments) taking an additional 6 hours. It’s definitely not a small game.As for the game itself, I’m going to not spoil any details here. However, if you’re rather not have a general idea of how the game and characters go, I understand. So if you’re pretty sure you want to play this yourself, I’d say you could stop here and get it. But if you want to know more, let me tell ya about the game by splitting it up into its main parts.Characters: I would say that Dangan Ronpa 2 has a weaker character lineup than the first game. They aren’t bad by any means (in fact, Teruteru and Hiyoko are the only two that were below middling to me…but they were pretty far down there), but they suffer from two things. First, when they’re introduced, there seems to be a two-dimensional running gag with a good amount of them and it completely envelopes their character. Things like eating all the time, needing to♥♥♥♥♥♥ being overly wimpy, being a pervert, obsessing over another character, etc. I think the writers didn’t quite make them feel like actual humans with these quirks until it felt too late. At least by that point you get to understand who they actually are and get to like them, but it makes me wish they were like that since the beginning. It’s only a handful of character and the rest are actually really good, but when that handful starts talking it made me think, “This again, huh?” The other problem is that I feel like a good amount of character archetypes are shared from the cast in the first game (sporty girl, buff person, ruse dude, etc). It’s not THAT bad; you get to know the characters more and they feel more distinct. However, it’s still something you have to get over. Though, ultimately, it is really good that a lot of the characters end up moving up the rating scale the more they show up/you talk to them. I definitely recommend Dangan Island in the postgame for any Free Time dialogue you missed.Environment: Dangan Ronpa 2 taking place on an open tropical island is a nice difference from the first game’s enclosed building. There are plenty of interesting areas that are great eye candy, plus they serve as good places for murder scenes and finding clues for said scenes. My main problem is that it feels like a wide-but-shallow sea. You visit a lot of the areas once and that’s it for literally the entire game. It felt like wasted potential a lot of time, but at the same time didn’t really hold the game back.Motives: I’m not gonna say anything about the motives themselves, but I feel like they’re weaker than the first game’s. Dangan Ronpa 1 had pretty interesting motives where the reveal twist as to why the murderer did what they did made even the odder of motives believable (at least, from what I remember years ago). This one kinda felt like they either weren’t strong enough for murder or just were nonsensical. Motives per chapter aren’t really THAT big in the whole scheme of things. But if you’re like me and kinda looked forward to what dastardly thing Monokuma would pressure the cast with every time, I wouldn’t get your hopes up too much.Murders and Trials: This game was very good about keeping you on your toes when figuring out what REALLY happened during a murder. After a point, you realize that anything is possible with the absurd things the murderers pulled off that, when explained by the end, actually ended up being believable. Granted, the class trials aren’t free of some outright stupid solutions that end up feeling like guess-and-check for some segments (and I found myself not looking too forward to minigames what weren’t Truth Bullets…especially Hangman’s Gambit…). However, it was fun looking over the clues before a trial, formulating what I think happened to cause that clue, then seeing if I was right and tweaking it with each new development until the real answer was clear. Also, the regenerating health perk really helped with letting me feel free to figure out the right answers, so I definitely recommend that.I’d say Dangan Ronpa 2 is an enjoyable and lengthy experience, but it has some noticeable flaws as well. As far as being a Dangan Ronpa game, it excels in retaining the formula that works and having great murders and class trials that define the series. It stumbles somewhat with making a chunk of the characters interesting, but eventually they do end up growing on you. Despite being self-contained for the most part, the plot and its little mysteries about the character and island keep an added interest on top of the murders that have a huge payout in the end. So yeah, I’d say give it a go if you liked the first game (and be careful when looking things up for it)!"
,Recommended,413420,35278867,Posted: 28 September,all,Cayla ♥,"To start off, I would just like to say I would reccommend this game to ANYONE I know, especially if they love a good thriller/murder mystery. I started off watching the anime (Danganronpa [1]) and I LOVED it. I then finished the season in one day, which I normally don't do, and I was ready to watch the second season. I then realized there was only a first and third season so I instantly bought the second game xD. It's a really cheap price (compared to most games these day which are around $60), and it has so much stuff to do even after the game. But the story line is fantastic and the class trials were great, they were definitely not easy! I was on the regular difficulty for it and I still died multiple times in the class trial. The plot twists were amazing, and I didn't even see them coming which normally I do. I'm not gonna sit here and bore you to death with details that can be found in other reviews, but this game was FANTASTIC! I definitely reccommend this, 10/10! ♥"
