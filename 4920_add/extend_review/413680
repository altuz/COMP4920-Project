76561198042646749,Recommended,413680,24380154,"Posted: 17 July, 2016",all,kris.aalst,"Statues is a 'survival horror' action adventure game. The premise is simple: you're up against statues and mannequins, who only move towards you when you're not looking at them. So you need to either back away from them (but who knows what you're backing into!) or run from them while doing what you need to do to advance to the next part of the game. What you need to do to advance varies from chapter to chapter, from a simple 'find a key or other item' to things like 'turn on the power so you can exit the building'. Each chapter takes place in a different setting like a hospital, a shopping mall, a subway, a forest, an amusement park, ...The graphics, music and ambient sounds are pretty good for an indie game. There are a couple of game mechanics that make Statues different from other (Unity based) games in the genre, and that make the gameplay somewhat more tactical than just running:blinking: you'll see a small bar in a corner of your screen, indicating when your character will blink. Blinking manifests itself as the screen going dark for a second or two, during which time the statues will have moved closer. You can also blink by pressing a button, so you can try to blink when it suits you rather than wait until you're forced to blink when you're already in a bit of a pickle.sprinting and fatigue: you are able to sprint but after a time, you'll need to catch your breath before you can sprint again. This makes sprinting in short 'bursts' a better option for some chapters.difficulty settings: playing the game on harder modes causes you to blink more often.The game is pretty short, a couple of hours altogether, but games like this shouldn't go on much longer, in my opinion. As you can see, I pressed 'yes' to recommend this game because I did think it was fun, but take into account that I only paid 99 cents for it during a sale. At that price, it's a no-brainer and definitely worth it. I see now that the regular price is 9.99, which is way too much for a game like this. So my advice: buy it only when it'sheavilydiscounted.Statues has 5 Steam Trading Cards and 9 Steam Achievements. But 7 of those are achieved by playing the game and just finishing each chapter. So achievement hunters should only mind 'Collector' (collect all notes) and 'Perfectionist' (find all cans). The locations of the cans are randomized each time you (re)load the game, but they can be seen from afar so you'll manage. For the notes, I made a short guide:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=726561612"

Diversified level design, surroundings, enemies and objectives.Tense and creepy atmosphere. Three difficult levels to choose from, with fair checkpoints and save game mechanism. It guarantees plenty of fun and many hours of playtime!"
,Not Recommended,413680,33123595,Posted: 2 July,all,Nuuskiss,"Good concept which gets booring far before it should. Indie develeoped Statues starts promisingly when protogonist wakes up in a hospital after a car accident. The building feels abandoned until suddenly some door smashing noices are made somewhere behind the close corner - after careful check only some nasty looking human anatomy presenting statue can be found, but after looking away from the statue and turning back one could swear that this being was trying to reach...protogonist blinks.. game over.While there isn't proper animated dying scenes like in FnF the first map of the game is good fun, having this creepy claustrophobic setting where evil can surround you in a corner if you are not careful. The next map is also entertaining but in the third one after an half an hour gameplay or something the game takes a twist which is good when thinking the varierty but when the game turns flat I would have wished that it continued the same way as before or was cut short.Luckily the rest of the game gets a bit better, but I can't never understand why devs tought that scenarios such as searching some fireworks in different parts of the large wide open theme park where attacking statues can be avoided blindfolded, would be entertaining.. If there was not google to cheat I'd be still looking the missing case of explosives. Fortunately not long after that the Statues concludes after boss match which gameplay separates again from the rest of the game.Statues is not entirely a bad game and I really liked how almost every map was an unique scenario and varierty was rich and imaginative. However there was just  relatively too much frustration and numbness in those 4 hours it took to complete and so I think get your shivering experience elsewhere unless you already have it or try the free demo before the purchase."

I also bought this game because the horror genre is one of my favorites.The game lacks any form of originality and the statues hunting you are hilariously stupid to the point of laughter instead of screaming in fear. The atmosphere does the game no favors by recyling old assets in cliche locations from hospitals, malls, subways and carnivals, Whilst those might make you say ""Hey that sounds like 2005's Condemned: Criminal Origins!""... yes that might be true, but it also sounds like every other horror game out there. Sadly the level design, is just poor. With a lackluster story, and a game that isn't very fun to play, I can recommend you give this a pass BUT PLEASE LOOK AT THE DEVELOPERS OTHER GAME HALF DEAD, IT IS VERY FUN TO PLAY WITH MATES!"

And I don't mean an insanely obscure, highly illogical one such as that sported by another recent release such as, hmmm, let's say Bleeding Border (look it up if you're in the mood for a laugh)!!  No, this one is actually well-conceived AND well-executed, the agonisingly simple yet terrifying concept being that WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE MONSTER, OR IT'S GONNA GET YA!!!  Now, that might not sound so hard to master to all you smart-arses out there, but there's a catch...like all human beings, your character has to BLINK every now and then, and when you do...well, let's just say you want to keep your enemies at substantially further than arm's length, or it's COITAINS for you...A quick look at the other reviews on the Store page will tell you that not all players have been happy with this blinking mechanic, and while I'm inclined to agree that it maybe lasts a TAD long when you do actually blink, I can't really think of how the devs could have handled this premise much better.  What many of these reviews don't seem to address - now, perhaps it was something which was added after the game's initial release, I can't rightly say - but you're actually very much in control of WHEN you blink, so it's really a time management task of deciding when it's safe to do so, and in the meantime you'd best keep a vague eye on your blink-o-meter to make sure the game doesn't do it for you at the worse possible time!  It's all quite manageable, though, and basically requires two things of the player:  Strategizing, and NERVES OF ♥♥♥♥ING STEEL.  Good thing I was raised by wild wolves, in the forests of Transylvania no less.  Ain't NOTHIN' scares this wolf-boy...er, except really bloody creepy VIDEO GAMES like this one!!Look, it's not perfect, and it's not the single greatest horror game ever made, but if you play anywhere near as many horror games as I do, you'll surely be able to tell that it's several cuts above a lot of the sheer and utter DRECK which passes for ""horror"" product on Steam these days.  It's well thought out, sincerely executed, and while it's maybe a tad repetitive after a while, it at least it shouldn't attract much undue attention from the ""this game is too short"" crowd (a group who, as much as they♥♥♥♥♥♥me, do unfortunately have a point when it comes to a lot of recent horror games).  Nor is anyone - certainly not I! - liable to finish it all in a single sitting, 'cause the tension is so thick you could stifle puppies with it.  I personally found myself having to have regular breaks, 'cause it really is quite exhausting and nerve-wracking to never let your enemy out of your sight.  Oh, and the ending just flat-out SUCKS...it's too hard and almost rage-inducing in its sheer lack of save points.  But the first four-fifths of the game is frankly excellent.Recommended to anyone who likes horror games which require BALLS.  Personally, mine are pretty small, but I do have two of 'em, and that still puts me one ahead of Hitler.  Speaking of twos, it just occurred to me that this game can be summed up in two words:  Grandma's Footsteps.  But the scariest ♥♥♥♥in' game of Grandma's Footsteps you WILL EVER PLAY.Verdict: 9/10.(PS ♥♥♥♥ that ending, though...)(PPS No, seriously, the ending can suck my sac.  Even on so-called ""Easy"" difficulty.)"

If so, you'll understand the ""Easter eggs"" along with the story, a bit better.If you've ever wondered what it's like to suddenly be in a situation where it's life and death, and you have to listen VERY carefully, because your life depends on it, this is the perfect game.  It allows you to follow a *very* dramatic storyline, along with jumpscares.Looking at the ""statues"" will allow you to stop them from moving, and as long as you are looking, they won't move.  Though you have to beware, there's rarely just one.In my opinion, it's fantastic, though I haven't played many horror games, in fact I've barely left the trail of games such as ""Minecraft"" and ""Terraria"".  This is actually my first horror game and am absolutely in love with it, as is my younger sister.It is, indeed, very frustrating and some parts will take more and more tries.There's three modes to it, easy, medium, and hard. So far, I've completed the easiest mode and am working on the medium mode, I'm completely in awe.This game has brought me to other such games as FNAF, and I definitely recommend this game to any person who's wanting a ""starter"" horror/indie game, or even one who is just looking for something fun to play.It would look amazing in VR.Just remember the quote from our Doctor.“The Doctor: Don't blink. Don't even blink. Blink and you're dead. Don't turn your back. Don't look away. And don't blink.”"
,Recommended,413680,20497002,"Posted: 12 January, 2016",all,TheGreenJacket,"To start, I have some mixed feelings about this game. First off, it was fun and interesting, not to mention scary, but there are certain things that this game has some problems with.First off, when it boasts ""different types of enemies"" mostly it means different designs. There are only really four different types. Some of the ""7 various locations"" you are in, you are in for less than a minute or two. Another problem I experienced was that I would get stuck in random places. For example, when I ran into a supply room I rubbed against some debris on the ground and suddenly I couldn't get out of that spot and had to restart my checkpoint. This happened several times, but sometimes this is unpreventable in games and it really didn't happen too often. Then there was the blinking. The blinking was a very interesting concept, one I have seen in several other games, but it's duration is much too long, almost two seconds. I don't know anyone who blinks for two seconds. But I suppose if they wanted to add it to the game they needed to make it to where it could really make a difference in your meeting with a statue. Another problem I had was the lack of information. For example;*SPOILER*At one point you have to escape a massive statue, which I have nicknamed ""The Divided,"" and as you run away from him he will every so often jump into the air and suck up everything in his path. If the player fails to be in an alleyway they will get sucked up and killed. I discovered what to do by complete accident after dying several times. This lack of information frustrated me and really took away from the game's experience. Plus the whole giant statue battle(s) really differed from the main game in an unattractive way.*SPOILER END*Now for the pros! This game was very scary. The first ""statues"" you encounter are skinless medical mannequins. These terrifying creatures will follow you, banging down doors until they catch you. The gameplay is very similar to Slender, but it does it very well. There are indeed several levels, each with similar but differing objectives.*SPOILER*Once you are given the hammer, however, it becomes less scary and more of a challenge. You avoid the statues while collecting the necessary items, only now you can destroy the statues.....temporarily. I loved that addition and it certainly made it more challenging.*SPOILER END*The game was also very beautiful. The graphics were smooth and everything was shaded very well. It is obvious that they tried very hard on the appearance of the game and it really sets the atmosphere.I bought this game on sale, but I feel that 10 dollars isn't too bad of a price for this game. But maybe buy it on sale. Again mixed feelings. I enjoyed certain moments, but quite a few took away from the experience. I suppose I would recommend it.Fun 3/5, Scary 4/5, Originality 2/5, Mature 3/5, Graphics 4/5, Worth the price? 3/5"
,Not Recommended,413680,25437998,"Posted: 9 September, 2016",all,verbaloid,"This game capitalizes on one of the innovative horror elements originally used in the legendary game Condemned: Criminal Origins, where in several places you were stalked by mannequins who were only moving when you didn't look. It was scary as hell, but it was executed with exquisite cinematography, just like everything in that game. Plus, as I said, this was merely one element, among many others.The creators of 'Statues' decided to build an entire game on this one element, disregarding the cinematography, the build-up and the small details. Well, for me it's like baking proverbial bread out of raisins, forfeiting the dough. So you're stalked by the mannequins against whom you can't do anything. Well, for one, in Condemned, you weren't supposed to outrun the statues or do something with them. The whole stalking served the only purpose to unnerve you.Here, though, you are somehow supposed to outrun the damned statues, which I found rather stupid and boring.I don't blame the devs, they've made a worthy effort. A small studio will never be able to make something so grand as Condemned beacuse of the sheer amount of work concerned. Nevertheless, a gameplay in this case should contain at least more elements than just the mannequin stalking. Yeah, you can play it all right. But in my mind it's much better to play the original Condemned saga, which is always fresh and will not date one bit even after another 10 years."

76561198083068272,Recommended,413680,25806541,"Posted: 1 October, 2016",all,TheBeak,"A good chunk of asset fueled Steam horror experiences can be tossed immediately into the junk pile.  Many are simply content to ape Amnesia, Penumbra and Outlast.  Others occupy different stylistic niches yet fail to employ even the bare minimum of passable features when it comes to gameplay.  Some are so short that you can't even imagine coughing up $10 let alone $4.99.  Room710Games' minimalistic horror debut Statues is a flawed piece of work but I don't regret the $10 I paid and with its recent price drop to $4.99 is worth a try.  It's far from a masterpiece but the game still offers an enjoyable experience slightly marred in some areas thanks to dogged repetition, frustration and a couple of irritating design choices.You play an unnamed protagonist who learns the hard way not to text and drive.  After wrecking his/her ride into the business end of an oncoming driver, this dummy wakes up in a hospital room to find out that the world is out to collect a karmic debt.  The abandoned building's medical mannequins are coming to life and they aim to kill you when you aren't looking.  Thusly, your character is thrust headfirst into a fight or flight adventure taking you through the city streets, nearby forests and parks, a carnival, a mall and more.  Each area has its own set of statues who stalk you when you're not looking.  There's not much in the way of weapons but you do get a hammer eventually to beat the suckers to death, though alot of the time you'll be timing your moves to escape mobs of these leadfooted morons.Making matters more desperate, you have a meter/gauge that depletes as you explore.  Once the meter is empty you're forced to blink.  In order to not catch yourself with closed eyes in a chase sequence, you can press ""X"" to blink manually.  The majority of the gameplay revolves around this mechanic and learning the locations of your foes, so that you know when you can shut your peepers.  Being forced into blinking before you want  of course allows your tailgaters to gain large amounts of ground on your trail and one hit will flatten you dead...you guys get the picture I'm sure...Most levels feature different main tasks, introduce at least one new type of enemy and have enough design variation so it doesn't look like you're trudging the same ground over and over again.  Despite attempts at differentiation, each area requires you to collect ""X"" amount of objects or perform ""X"" amount of tasks.  You'll be backtracking throughout every level quite a bit and this sometimes will wear on the nerves.  In areas where you are unarmed there is always the risk of death, because until you complete your objectives you'll be pursued pretty frequently.  Once you're armed you will be able to clear a map of hostiles and do your work in peace.  Scattered sparingly are notes that outline a vague, vague, vague storyline which won't clear anything up until you finish the game in its entirety.  Even the story bits you are clearly fed don't add up to too much.  In context it works and it's not as distracting or as disjointed as some bargain bin narratives that popped in say Kidnapped, Chasing Dead, Back in 1995, etc.To add some additional gameplay elements for variety are the inclusion of escapes from vicious boss characters who you will face head-on in combat later in the game's playtime.  The controls handle decently, but expect to get stuck on your surroundings from time to time and be prepared to watch the framerate blow out its shorts in a display of brown fireworks nobody wants to deal with.  Frankly these stutters and mapping/pathfinding issues will get you murdered and more than once you're going to end up flatout cussing the game into oblivion.  This is especially egregious in the aforementioned boss sequences and the final level in particular.  Your foes aren't as prone to getting stuck as you are, so expect even the random enemies to getcha even when you're on a roll.  These problems weren't totally game-ruining but they ain't fun either.Statues isn't a jaw-dropping graphical tour de force either but for an asset-built romp it's quite above average.  The lightning is nice, the areas are drawn with a solid amount of detail, the bosses are appropriately grand and certain special FX are well-implemented.  Everything has a smooth, shiny sheen on it which works for the enviroments but makes standard enemies, your hands and items, etc,. look like they were all modled with clay.  FPS slowdown occurs more than it should and the unskippable ""freeze"" death or your character are annoying as hell but other portions of Statues are animated admirably.  In the sound department expect appropriate ambient noise and music.  There is nothing truly spectacular about the sound design but it does a good job of setting a mood, especially once a statue is on your six; although it must be mentioned that a few of Statues' musical themes (I'm looking at you final level, you S.O.B.) will get beyond annoying and irritating after a couple of respawns.On the hardest difficulty Statues took me about 8-9 hours to complete.  Some of my lengthy gametime was spent paused in frustration on some of the boss battles and getting much needed respite in my endless attempts to beat the last level.  I'd say on normal you'll probably spend 5-7 hours wrapping up its story, but good luck getting some of the tougher parts down to a science.  Memorization is your friend...though don't be surprised if you die and have no idea how the f*** it happened!Pros:-Good concept borrowed right out of a sci-fi/horror TV series.-Intimidating boss fights.-Varied mix of areas and situations.-Game design allows for a bit of fight or flight which is nice.-Eerie sound FX when being pursued.-Above average graphics in certain areas.-Overall play control makes the game fun to pick up and enjoy.Cons:-Repetitive level objectives involving endless fetch quests.-Framerate hiccups will lead to some hardcore cheap deaths.-Poor mapping for movement results in getting stuck to await cheap deaths.-Basic enemies aren't scary, aren't graphical marvels and they all have the same killin' you animation.-Annoying music in a few of the hardest levels that you'll hear over and over and over and over and over and over...-General story isn't bad but could use more exposition.-The last level...simply its very existence.Overall:  6.9/10Not quite deserving of a full 7 but better than a middle 6, Statues is plagued by some issues that will dampen your fun more than once.  Still, when I would finally overcome a few of the game's toughest sequences I was always excited to push onto the next level.  In that respect the game does reward your persistence.  There are better games on the horror market for sure, yet something about Statues makes it well-worth a play especially for its super cheap pricetag.  I didn't feel ripped off even paying $9.99 for it.  If you've beaten all of the big box creepy games and are working your way across the 2nd/3rd tier of horror ""good if not quite a classic,"" titles Statues is a solid pick.  It might not have much in the way of replay value but it offers up interesting ideas, a couple of semi-original twists, decent gameplay and a satisfying length for the money."

It should be fixed, and my third problem is connected with this,,,- It need more advanced AI. Ai that can operate on his own, looking for you if not seeing you ect... they should not know where are you all the time, give the opportunity to the player to fear, and make them hide, make tactics... make possibble to confuse enemies... it is not fun just to outrun enemies, and being fast... it is not scary, it is annoying- Make some places to hide.(Like closet doors or wardrobes or whatever make possibble to the player to fear)- it need more detailed places. This game is currently empty. It just a bunch of random objects and repeated rooms.- The statues not look statues at all...- Horrible VERY horrible animation. At least use a reference like a motion capture from somewhere even from a video or something- Also, if i dont light the monsters they are still frozen in the dark if i look at them, but they should attack if you cannot see them- This blinking bulls*it... So, it is a good idea, but please make faster the blinking... the fastest human organ is the eyelid, now.. in this concept i am with a narcoleptic sloth character...  Please make the blinking faster, but limit something, for example the torchlight, make a need to get batteries, but for exchange; make the blinking faster...

The concept of the game is quite  interesting in the sense that the monster chases you  when you turn your back to him but when you face him he becomes immobile like a statue. Now you cannot face him constantly because each 10 seconds your eyes blink  for a few seconds and this is when he can snatch you.

The AI are not dumb, its like the movie ""It Follows"" no matter where you are they are walking towards you, but they are walking, then you turn the corner and one is standing there haha. Doors and closed rooms are your friends, kite them.Not much for death scenes, yet not many annoyances either. Some repetition in how you avoid enemies and such but I am truly enough all of it.Too many Space Invaders machines in the mall :)Pick it up you wont regret it!"

Makes you wonder where you'll go and where to find your objectives.Jumpscares (sometimes).Cons:Very short chapters.Repetitive task.No plot.

It looks really cool and plays really well, the 'statues' are bloody creepy and the strategies for getting around them are interesting and easy to figure out.

Edges, doors, short walls, etc...-Unresponsive controls make it hard to interact with objects and pick up items.-Gameplay changes at certain times, statues move even when you look at them, non-statue creatures appear, etc. These changes are poorly implemented. They should have stuck to the original concept.-Terrible controller support. You can't customize the controller layout and the preset configuration is horrendous.-Often tedious goals and unclear objectives (Why do I have to collect fireworks?).Yes this game has a lot of problems, but if you are interested in the survival horror genre it may be worth the purchase."

You have a perpetually draining blink meter which will make you blink automatically, or you can refill the meter on your own.  The blink lasts for a full second, which is seriously immersion breaking given that you are doing it constantly.  I didn't even get past the tutorial section before that one thing annoyed me so much I had to uninstall the game.On the plus side, this developer did include essential control options such as rebinding your keys and mouse inversion, which seems to be increasingly uncommon for indie developers.  Kudos for that :)"

I was only able to put in a couple minutes before I had to quit because of motion sickness.Something about the FP in this game was nauseating and I couldn't continue past the hospital. I really wish I could continue, but completing the game isn't worth vomiting and a severe headache. So if you have rather bad motion sickness like me (as in, so bad that simply moving your head while sitting in a car is enough to induce dizziness), this game may not be for you."

Overall, for being and indie and a cheap game, it's worth it. it took me around 6 hours of gameplay to get trough. And yes, the game CAN get creepy at times. 7/10."

Bottom line, I took a chance... and well, not all that impressed at first glance.I get the point of this game (ie. patience to some degree and basically timing your moves); but for me, I just can't stand using a keyboard for controls.  I knew that going in with this game; but I'm a controller guy.  It feels like less of a game to me having to use a keyboard.I have to say no on the recommendation unless you buy it now for the $4.  Then maybe it's worth that."
