Good atmosphere, fun gameplay, amazing soundtrack thanks to Vitaliy Ruzankin and one of the most dedicated developers. There are maybe some bugs now, but just take a look at the negative review comments. Devs responding, showing drive to fix bugs and are actively fixing them too! You can look in the discussion too they are active there as well and they even fixed  bugs in one ♥♥♥♥ing day! And yes this is a big thing. ♥♥♥♥ing other games do not get bugfixed in YEARS!  I believe this is a very underrated part because there can't be any more good to an early access game than commited devs. Huge props to them!I'll  have a lot of fun with this game in the next few weeks to come.

I know it is Early Access, but it is in version .9 now and should have most of the bugs worked out. I KNOW IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE HARD. Here is a list of bugs I came across not even mentioning the horrific balancing and game mechanics:1. Villager instantly died from illness, then when I revived him with faith, he kept insta-dying.2. I bought ""Reinforcements"" from the nomads, 8 to be exact, but nothing showed up, no one came. I spent all of my wood on them for nothing.3. I ""declared war"" on the Nords. I selected 6 soldiers to go, but nothing happened. No war happened at all.4. My villagers were going to sleep for like 20 hours a day. They would wake up and I would task them, then walk about 10 steps before turning around to go back to sleep. Happened with multiple villagers.Those are just what I would consider ""bugs"" so far. There is a laundry list of unintuitive gameplay controls and mechanics. It took me 2 hours of play to figure out how to get villagers to do stuff. The combat it horrific, random villagers seem to run into battle and throw themselves in the line of fire instead of staying behind the hero or well armed villagers. You can't really control villagers(especially in battle), you cant position them very easily, you have to issues them a tasks(chop wood, hunt, gather berries, ""guard here"", etc) to make them do anything so combat is very difficult to control. All combat involves is people standing next to each other swinging repeatedly. That is fine, but it is very difficult to get anyone to fight the right enemy, so everyone dies when they didn't need to. Nords are stupid OP. They come demanding resources from you every couple of days, if you can't pay then they attack you. Usually if you can't pay you aren't going to be able to defend against them either. I went to attack the nords and they had an infinite supply of soldiers to keep throwing at me. I killed like 10-15 of them, but they kept coming, even after I destroyed the two houses they were getting all of this population from (wtf). The skeletons come every night. These are just some of the gameplay mechanics that are awful. The balancing is up to interpretation as this is supposed to be difficult. The problem is when the difficulty is amplified by the shoddy controls and UI. Really, I haven't seen many games with this bad of a UI. Half the time I am in a menu and have no idea how to get out of it or get to a different menu. There are losts of clunky problems involving tasking the villagers and getting the right ones to do the work you want. I would be okay recommending this if the devs were able to streamline the UI and controls more and get rid of some of the bugs. I can't recommend it until then though."

A negative with this game is that it is early accsess and very buggy. My villagers keep getting stuck when i make them do something but cancel, or that the enemy just freezes and make me able to kill them without them harming me. The god i choose is basically useless because their 'special' attack rarely hits the enemy. This game is still in early accses so i understand bugs and problems, but these bugs were really annoying.

I'll hire some mercs and they'll help.   They didn't help at all.  When the nords attack they tore through those mercs like paper.  Be nice if the first wave of nords wasn't that massive and powerful.  Ya really kinda just forced to HAVE to surrender to them.  Which kinda sux.  Not a fan of forced play style.   My hero died and for what ever reason it would not let me build the altar.  And when activating his power for some reason he would then just stand there and get beat up.   Soap gets used up real fast and I can't generate enough seeds to keep making soap and growing crops.  So everyone falls into sickness.   Workers set to hunt for some reason just stop hunting.   Works set to gather berries will stop searching for berries.  Not sure I understand the mechanic as to why.   There was berries inside the town gate.   Trees seemed to spawn faster then I can cut down so that I clear space to build.  That made things difficult to get buildings placed.    The hotbar at the bottom will just vanish.   Had to hit ESC to get it back.    Hopefully, this game gets more support and can get more people working on it.   Be nice to see this game become something more grand."

Haven't gotten to far into it yet though.There are some bugs and a couple of exploits you can do...---Too the developers---For example; When ordered to harvest wood or stone, build structures etc, sometimes the villagers just stand there swinging and are unable to harvest anything. This will loop forever, restarting the session usually helps. Can be frustrating in the long run...Ordering and cancelling stuff in the workshop will add resources to your stock. This can be done how many times you'd like, as long as you have the initial costs to buy one article. I don't do that, it makes the game too easy and unchallenging.The hero doesn't autotarget new enemies after killing the first one, don't know if it's a bug or if it's pre-determined. I've lost my hero several times due to this.Please fix these ASAP.Otherwise it gots good potential."

,Not Recommended,414080,18884594,"Posted: 4 November, 2015",all,AnExiledGod,"This was clearly released too soon. It's still using the Personal Version of Unity...The game started in a 2560x1440 even though I have a 1080p screen, it's not a widescreen. So I had to scoot that over to change the resolution. As soon as I changed the resolution the screen went black and remained that way. Had to restart the game to see the changes, finally decided I'd just click Fullscreen and that seemed to do the trick.Once you get in-game you'll see the tutorials are VERY lacking, the moving speed (moving the camera left and right) is really fast and no adjustments for it. When you click buttons there is no indication it was clicked so you have no idea if the button you just hit actually worked or not.The game in it's current condition is not worth it, even at $7. I'll personally be refunding it. It's pretty clear this was someones hobby project. They're inexperienced and they released it far too early. I thought it would be at least SOMEWHAT as fun and interesting as Kingdoms, but there is just far too little polish. It needs some major work."

I usually monitor how much active memory I have in use, due to my limited amount, and was surprised that this game takes up more than most Unity and Unreal based games, such as  Warframe, Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor (that one was genuinely surprising), etc. Again, I love the concept and have seen some in-game screenshots, so I hope this will be fixed soon, but as of now I wouldn't recommend spending the money on it."
76561197981998173,Recommended,414080,20548053,"Posted: 15 January, 2016",all,Revolution,"Where to begin with this game... I love the concept and i understand that this is in beta but. . .This game has some serious problems to the point of not being fun. For example the nords guy comes almost every day to demand resources from you or else they attack. Thats a great concept. However, you only give us 1 day to prepare between each time he comes. The first day he requires 8wood/stone. Then the next is 20? How is this fun?You don't allow the players to build any proper defenses or even allow us to place stuff where we want to. Last i checked Farms are built in open fields not on dead trees only.Also i dont know if im the only one getting this game breaking bug but the women always sit in the houses sleeping... They dont even make any more babies ... they just sleep. Now i dont want to bring sexism into this but i think women do more then just sleep...Also there is no quick move function other then space bar to MAYBE go where your base is begin attacked. Building have no hp so they are dead before you can press space bar anyways. Also since you are under attack you can't even defend against it.Hero has no hp, attack damage or changeable equipment. Matter of fact he isnt even that speical. Why even have him in the game.The list of issues continues i just dont feel like investing any more time at the moment into this.In summary your game is broken. There is just so many issues that the game is bordering on unplayable.::Edit:: After comments from Pirozhok studioYou say every three days but i've had ""Nord Ambassador""  come every two days, during a few of my play throughs.I've been playing rts style games since warcraft, command and conquer, and starcraft. To me this is what this game reminds me of. A 2D rts/survival which is great. Like i said before I love the concept and understand that this game is in its early stages. However, a much better user interface is needed. You should be able to have  ""warrior units"" that you equipt with proper gear  be selectable and hotkeyed.  If it is night time for example i should just be able to find the threat ""press 1""  and send my troops to defend. HECK maybe even have a formation where archers are in the back with the melee troops in the front. I mean that would be an awesome idea.Day and night cycle needs to be extended. I didnt time your cycles exactly but 3 min of day time seems kinda off and that night time doesnt really feel tense enough. I want to sweat dreading night time. Not just day night day night. Should be a dusk and dawn with events (like skellies burn in sun light). Maybe have the monsters act differently during the cycles. It is just a throught. Right now its just very bland.With all due respect but the hero is useless at the start of the game. His spells suck. He can barley survive the first night of skellies. Hp regen is a joke even with the ""skill"" you provide. He didnt even regen his hp fast enough from the first night to survive the second night. He has no upgradeable equipment.  At least non that i can see. I felt that this hero is compareable in damage to an unarmed village person ..... I mean that cant be right lol. Also instead of have skills cost faith have a hero leveling system would be much more involved. Get a little rpg element to it would be fun.Next topic building placement. Yes i know upgrading your town hall gets you increased building radius. However, if i build the ""gates"" to block skellies, nords, or those meteorite fire guys. It doesnt matter cause all it does is slow them down. You cant move your guys (other then the hero) to defend the gate. Also you cant build the archer towers close enough to the gates to even defend the gates before they are breached. Speaking of the gates are they made of wood or paper cause the skellies break them down within seconds. Its not just the archer towers, i have had countless troubles placing every one of the provided buildings. For example You can only place farms  on trees or berry bushes. Thats kinda silly.Wood Resourses.... You literally have a forest of trees in the background... Yet after the 5th night. Takes my villagers a day to go find a tree to chop down and bring it back... A whole day. So unless i use three faith to build a tree to have it chopped down closer my town hall, the expanding process becomes next to impossible. This would be less of a problem if i could build the supply building where ever i want but even after expanding my base still wont let me place it where i want inside my walls. The walls of which i cant defend.... with the gate made of paper.Stone Resourses... Not much of a problem here at the start pretty straight foward. My only advice here would be in the tutorial make it so you set your guy to auto mine before switching to the farming part of the tutorial. I forgot to go back to set him to mine a few times. My  problem with mining was only until my miners explored more of the mine that Hey they are under attack. Oh whats this a portal that has tons of minions coming out of.... I love the idea of the whole underground area but i dont think they should just automatically come out of the portal and attack. You should the one to unlock the next area of the mine. Not just have 12 goblins come out and kill all your miners. SURPRISE!... It wasent a very fun surprise. You should have the portal be closed untill your troops open the portal so you can atleast confront the threat when your ready.Food.... is not bad. Need to lower the damage of the animals in my opinion. Farming is easy enough but you should should have a tooltip to make it automatic farming. I dont want to be bothered auto planting four farms constantly of pumpkins, wheat, and corn. Suppose to be a god in the game right? Same thing with shrooms in the underground. Should be auto farmable.Towns people: Need to be able to fully heal after sleeping for a day. If i have warrior units i need them fresh for the 3 min day night cycle. I dont have to have to sit there and take off all the gear and put them on someone else. Thats boring and slows the game down.Had an idea for a new area while typing this. Do the whole jack and the bean stalk  story. Have an event where you can plant beans in the farm and grow them into the clouds. Have your troops attack a castle with monsters to steal treasure. Could be fun for a new area down the road.Thanks for taking the time to write me back. Since you took the time i wrote all this as my thanks! Good look with the game and im looking foward for future updates."

I gave it a try, as I love strategy and resource management games, and it simply does not manage to keep me interested. The game feels clunky (the interface is subpar at best), and only a few parts of the resource management can be automated (I don't think you can automate farming, for instance), which is not great for a ""strategy"" game (imagine sending a worker in starcraft to the mineral patch manually every time).

Assign workers to more permanent jobs, picking berries for example.5. Be able to scroll while game is paused.All in all it is a decent game and it has some potential. Id recomend it for now but it will change if these quality of life stuff doesnt get improved."

A few hours in I had a couple of failed kingdoms and once even reached past the winter. However due to glitches and bugs, I had to delethe the file. So I stopped playing for a while and a couple of months later returned. There was a major update. However, what I noticed was that the game got a lot harder. Skeletons got way stronger (New classes were added) and they arrived earlier. Also the bugs remained but were not as common. This resulted in me getting♥♥♥♥♥raped in the first 3 days. I recently started playing this game again. Alot has changed but it's still unplayable to some extent. However I think that if the devs remain active, this game can become a notable title on the indie scene."
