,Recommended,414120,22543274,"Posted: 20 April, 2016",all,D Vive,"A flagship Vive experience that really takes advantage of the Vive's strengths. Tracked motion controls make it like you live inside Garry's Mod instead of just playing around with stuff. It's not just what you can build that's cool, but that the objects and tools feel so good. It's an even better physics game creation kit than a contraption builder.There's plenty of immediate fun from a collection of built-in scenes like shooting gallery and ping-pong (instant favorites for me), and many others which are all editable. Plus you can share your levels or contraptions and download others using Steam Workshop. Actual multiplayer is planned but not available yet though. There's so much content already that the only way you won't get your money's worth is if you somehow just don't like physically interacting with things or building things.Shooting RangeI started off in the shooting range and took out targets using the crossbow and pistol and shurikens. I tried and failed to shoot an arrow straight up and land it on myself, but I got pretty close a few times. Once I realized I could shoot the platter with the pistol I spent 20 minutes just doing that. Throw it up, shoot it down range, shoot it repeatedly on the same side to spin it faster and faster, warp to chase it down or spawn something new. Even with just the no-frills pistol it's really fun to practice shooting using different techniques.Ping-pong / table tennisThis was the best surprise and made me care enough to write this review. The ball and stroke mechanics are amazing and could easily be the core of a dedicated game. Whatever they did I hope they never change it.I'm not a tournament-level table tennis player by any means, but have trained with some serious people and have a table and ball machine in real life - and I was blown away at how realistic the shot-making is in modbox. At first I had no expectations and batted the ball around, which worked well, so I decided to try hitting some realistic shots, which took some getting used to. It's not like the wii where you're instantly good at everything from being a gamer.I tweaked the included ping-pong level's ball machine to send slightly deeper and faster shots from farther away to make it easier. Then I spent 45 straight minutes hitting every kind of shot I could think of against the dummy. I was able to use a deep shakehand grip comfortably with the Vive controller and hit topspin, backspin, pushes, drives, sidespin, drop shots, and even fade loops from forehand or backhand. Hook loops didn't work as well as I'd hoped, but I'm not that great at them anyway so it's probably me. By the end I could reliably bounce a shot off the dummy and follow it up to the open court. I was sweating from driving with my legs and moving but it was a ton of fun."

His discovery of building cars and trains, from scratch and that work, has unlocked a whole new level of his imagination.If I let him I'm pretty sure he would spend an entire week inside this experience.My sole complaint is that time evaporates when building in Modbox and listening to a custom playlist. There's just something remarkable that happens when you start crafting machines and contraptions.If you enjoy creating ""things"" and random experiments, you'll enjoy this title."

76561198001370462,Recommended,414120,31456873,Posted: 29 April,all,Creativelymad,"This game was the absolute perfect playground to really get into VR for me.  Having multiple maps and gamemodes right out of the box felt like having a bunch of multiple tastes of everything that VR could be, and it didn't leave me wanting at all.  But, then it occured to me that this was only the beginning of what this game was, and could be.  I played around with the creation tool (very minimally, I'm serious when I say I just played around) and immediately felt the scope of what these developers were trying to create.  It is an infinite box full of goodies.  For the price tag, anybody trying to get into their Vive should immediately pick this game up.  There are very few great games for VR, and just buying this one game alone will add an assortment to your collection, and that assortment will continue to grow over time as the developers AND community add onto it.Lets talk about what content actually exists in here though.  There were a few demo modes that just shows off some toys you can play with demonstrating the engine and what can be created with this tool.  But, many are entire game modes that you'll enjoy the most.  My favorite was the wave shooter where you use a bow as your main weapon.  Shooting the bow was a fun experience in itself, but god I literally built up a sweat dodging enemy fire.  I tried pulling moves like Neo, seeing how far I could bend backwards to dodge a shot.  On the same vein, I enjoyed the tower defense mode, also defending against waves.  I love wave shooters in general, so playing it in VR is just a blast.  I've only played a hand full of the modes, but there are 3-4 pages full of modes you can experience.  There is a lot of content there to play already, and that was only what the devs had created, I haven't even touched community stuff yet.But, what inspired me the most to write this review was what I saw just today.  The developers update vlog on their Youtube channel.  These guys are dedicated to continuing to not only add onto the functionality, and game modes, but they also created and continue to update development tools to make it easier for others to add scripts/models and modify the game.  They are working, and succeeding, at making this game an endless space for development, and that excites me to keep checking in to see what is next, both from the developers and my fellow players.Lastly, I mentioned it before, but once again the price tag is great.  Too many developers are overcharging for their games since it's a niche market, and sadly it only scares consumers away.  But, these are the kind of guys that clearly love what they're doing more than it just being a cash out.If you have an HTC Vive, buy this game.  For how much product there is in this game already, and for a price tag just a little more than eating at Chic-fil-a, there is honestly no excuse for it to not be in your library."

I want to make VR games out of my ideas and designs. Until a HIGHLY polished version of Unity 3d Editor becomes available, NOTHING comes close to prototyping out game ideas in the way that Modbox does. I would highly recommend Modbox to any aspiring game developer as well as the game design amateur enthusiast. The Dev's communicate very well with the community and updates are regularly rolled out! Easily the coolest way to express video game creativity using your vive and then playing in those creations ONLINE WITH OTHER PEOPLE (your friends can download your mini games for free to play them online with you!)"

I think I could play it for another 12 without getting bored. Among VR games, this is difficult to find.

The modding element is excellent and easy to use but it's not exclusive if creation is not your bag, theres many well crafted workshop games and experiences, both single and multiplayer. Hours of things to tryout and always new ones coming onboard. Limitless value for a small price.What's really amazing is how well everything appears and operates considered they've been constructed within Modbox, some content is so slick it feels like a standalone game and better than many VR games out there.There's no other VR title like Modbox and it would be hard to make something similar that's better than this. I wish the developer every success they've earned it.Most definately recommended, it's earned the right to live your VR library."

There is a ton of stuff you can do and make.  There are also lots of already-made community maps and items to play with.  The dev seems fairly active and the games openness to user made content should eventually make this the VR version of GMOD.  The only current downside is that you can't ride the vehicles and monstrosities you create, which was awesome in GMOD.  I think there is a camera feature that you can add to things to drive things from a drivers perspective, but I haven't fiddled with them yet."

Getting this games means that you no longer need to buy many other games because the mods in these games have similar if not better games.  For example, the newest addition of the Zombie Saloon and Modern Weapon mods makes similar other zombie and gun games not necessary.  Best value for my money so far.  This is great, my only complaint is there doesn't seem to be any other online people to play with.  Since I've played, I only encountered 1 other guy in which I fought in the arena.  Other times, I'm just playing alone, which is okay but having a big social base would be perfect."

Was very satisfying to watch it slowly demolish a little wooden shack I made in front of it!As a professional 3D artist myself, I gotta say, being able to create something in VR, and move around it to look at it from different angles to line things up, to have true perspective of what I'm working on, feels great!

Imagine being able to build weird stuff, including: RC cars and dumb vehicles, small little ""dollhouse"" models to play with, huge contraptions with tubes, game setups for example I build one where you need to throw rings into poles, and one where you need to aim a slingshot correctly to shoot a basketball.It's really nice if you have the creativity to play with it, the controls are really intuitive too and the presence is there.What's missing: it needs more content, more stuff! And also it crashes often when you play with elastic bands and ropes. Anyway, I can't not reccomend this if you like physics sandboxes."

This is one of the coolest things I have done in VR...I have only played for a little bit, but am just blown away by the physics.  It is awesome.  Great price for what you get.  Highly Recommend..."

Intuitive controls, graphics are great, physics are fun to play with. You can pretty much make a video game in Modbox. I did find slight performance and stutter issues with 2x scaling depending on the map size loaded, but might just be my machine setup."

If anyone has an HTC Vive you need to get this game, spend an hour or 2 learning how to build stuff and how the mechanics work and you'll have a very good experience in this game!I did a youtube video of it, although I'm not an expert I still enjoyed it a lot.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja9QIgSE5Sg"

It feels like early access in that it's kinda sparse.That being said, playing this game in VR is a lot of fun. Others have drawn comparisons between this and Gary's Mod. That's a fitting comparison, though I would say that given the nature of VR, this feels less like a sandbox game and more like you're actually there and playing with a unique set of toys.The items you're given actually feel like they're right there in front of you, when you build a contraption that works, it  is very fulfilling.I'm looking forward to getting more tools to work with, perhaps some scenarios that need to be overcome using your ingenuity and the tools at hand.I also hope some more work is done on the physics as throwing things can feel a little bit off, for example throwing a basketball makes the ball feel heavier than it should be.Who knows, either way, this is a great title for people who want something engaging to play with their Vive. There are countless hours of fun to be had already, and it will probably only get better over time."

Plenty of stuff to play around with already, but i'd suggest everyone with a weak imagination to wait for the multiplayer and SDK to get released. It is a building game, so if you have no imagination, what exactly would you build?I myself were a huge fan of Garry's Mod in my younger days, and this is exactly what i needed to spark my interest for building again. Building in VR is just so much more fun (and physical demanding) on a whole 'nother level!"

I got it because of the great additions recently like Suburbia where you can build houses and fill them with furniture and design items.  Used it to build out my basement that we are getting ready to finish to give my wife an idea of the finished product.  Very useful.  Tons of other user generated content to see on the workshop.

The only issue i have is that most of the content is improved by being multiplayer, so if you play alone that will suck.but overall i think you can have alot of fun with this game even on your own"
,Recommended,414120,28245063,"Posted: 7 December, 2016",all,Sakhado,"Modbox is what you would consider to be the Garry's Mod of VR Games.Pros:- Easy to build gamemodes- Various weapons and objects you can use to do various things to the environment(ex. axe to chop wood)- Extremely easy to get intoCons:- You can't really go in depth on some projects.- It is quite basic- The controls are a bit finicky.Overall I would suggest this game, IF you do not want to create items/detailed worlds yourself. It is more of a sandbox experience, than a creator tool."
