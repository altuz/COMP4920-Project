I'll keep this short but keep it effective.Pros-atmosphere- you actually feel like your on the titanic and it's sinking-Titanic is a replica- this ship's layout is a detailed  copy exactly of the titanic-its scary- not in a horror type of way but more like ""HOLY S**' when your walking down a hallway, your flashlight dies and you a metal door breaks down, bring in huge amounts of water- its challenging as you have to use your brain and figure out the puzzles to escape- The ENTIRE SHIP IS EXPLORABLE! at least what ive seen and you can explore it in a mode when its not sinking so you can see everything without the thought of dying coming to mind lolcons- not the best detailed but you have to give it some slack compared to what it's trying to do, I've never played a true sim that's actually extremely detailed- Controls? I cant figure out the controls and there not in the settings but in the game scattered- NO NPCS yetOverall its worth the price and if your a titanic fan, you have to buy this experieance, you shouldnt regret it"

,Not Recommended,414130,19491025,"Posted: 4 December, 2015",all,Kewne,"I'm a bit of a steamliner enthusiast (thanks to regular RMS Queen Mary visits here in Southern California) and been craving for a game that allows the free roaming of rooms in the RMS Titanic, a mode that was absent in the classic Titanic: Adventure Out of Time Point-&-Click PC game, and a huge feature of the upcoming Titanic: Honor And Glory game that's been in production for quite a few years now.Despite mixed reviews I decided to give this a try (mostly because my biased hobby on old steamliner ships of the 20th century)So far I have only toyed around with the free roam mode (I will edit in my thoughts on the ""escape"" mode once I try it out), but from my experience from it I'm kinda meh over it. The graphics aren't the best (it's unity, I'm not expecting the same high res models that T:H&G is spitting out) which I could get over if it weren't for the fact that view rendering is absurdly short - like I look down a corridor, and I see open ocean - until I walk forward, and then the hall renders suddenly. Also there seems to be a bit of oversaturation & lens flare going on.The attention to detail of getting most of the layout & details of the Titanic quite accurate (not as accurate as T:H&G, but they have a MUCH more devoted team for R&D), and makes me happy, but the rendering problems just ruins the immersion for me.The time period music is nice, classical music.The placards at the start and around the ship pointing out the rooms feels a little cheap and kinda ruins the immersion a little, but it's a limitation of the engine & I get what the developer(s?) were aiming for.There were a few points where I was able to walk off the ship, plummet to the ocean below, only to suddenly reappear at the starting point near the dining salon.The developer(s?) gets huge props for the work they put on it. The fact that they wanted to fully recreate the Titanic is just awesome to me, the price is extremly cheap, and because of my biased obsession I really WANT to like & reccomend this game. I'm willing to even forgive that there's not much of a story/game simply if it were for the fact that it's a interactive 3D museum of the Titanic - but in it's current state, I just can't, it feels unfinished.TL:DR - good concept/idea, game feels incomplete & is buggy."

Fall of the Titanic I would say.First of all the game is not long and I dont expect it to be. Its made by a hardworking student after all.And I appreciate the work that he/she (Probably he) has put into this game. It inspires me to make my own game which I have started.Well lets get to some Pros and Cons shall we!Pros: The pressure. While playing I was constantly in panic when the ship was flooding. I was scared. And that is good. You`re like one of the passengers in 1912. Scared.Graphics. For a student made game the graphics are AMAZING. Sure not on the Crysis level, but still impressive.Cons: Lack of NPCs. Now I didn`t expect anything great when I bought this fun little game. And like Ive said countless of times hes a hardworking student and still he managed to create this. Im sure the dev will add NPCs to the game over time. Now it feels a bit boring, but fun at the same time.Short. Again not expecting it to have a 10 hour story, but more modes (In case the dev is really creative) would add playtimes for me. I will continue on explore mode but a little more would be better.Overall: Buy this and not the bag of candies.Its an amzing game for the price and I respect the dev for his effort.Buy this game now.

You would get stuck in most staircases, that is if they even lead anywhere. And you would fall of the boat if you dared to get near a buggy wall. And it would run 10 FPS if you wanted to render further than 10 feet.Sinking Mode is awful, You could spend 2 hours to simply watch the ship slowly lean forward and not even split, you could also shorten it to half an hour if you are in a hurry, I suppose that is a wonderful choice.Even the store page would crash on me and it was also discovered that many of the models were from Google Sketchup's public models and they were created by one of the developers of an upcoming game ""Titanic: Honor and Glory"" I reccomend that you take a look at them if you liked this game.But recently they have made many great improvements to the game, making it look much better and boosting game performance. Introducing Museum mode was probably the biggest step in the right direction.I hope ""The W Games"" reads this, because I hope they keep up the good work!"

Mann,"Fall of the Titanic, developed by TheWgames, is a good example of what an early access game is meant to be, not a finished product.You’re put in the shoes of a faceless, voiceless soul aboard the infamous Titanic… and that’s pretty much all there is to it. The store page actually makes this barebones experience seem rather cool. It claims to have a near-perfect replica of the Titanic for you to explore and admire. I may not be able to confirm this game’s authenticity - seeing as how I’m no expert on the Titanic - but the attention to detail is evident as ever. A lot of care was put into the design of this game, and wandering through the Titanic’s sprawling innards is a unique adventure. It’s impressively large and does a good job of representing the ship’s true glory… before it sank, of course.But apart from that, there’s little else to praise. You’re only given two modes to play: Explore and Escape. ‘Explore,’ as you’d expect, see’s you wandering throughout the ship. As I’ve already stated, the game is astatically pleasing, but the Titanic has never been so empty. With no NPCs to speak of, there’s little to do other than walking and admiring. This seriously pulled me from the experience because, as we all know, the Titanic was crammed with hundreds of passengers. Seeing it in this vacant and lifeless state gives off an eerie vibe; a vibe I don’t think the developer was shooting for.‘Escape’ mode serves as your only semblance of gameplay. Your goal is to find keys and bypass obstacles throughout the ship, reach the deck, and get on a lifeboat before it’s too late. This sounds really cool on paper. Imagine the sheer terror and chaos of trying to escape the sinking Titanic. It would make for some great content in a video game. But, alas, I didn’t get the thrill ride I was hoping for.Running about the Titanic’s claustrophobic corridors, hunting for keys and racing against the ocean’s wrath is a surprisingly dull experience. Due to your character’s ridiculous head bobbing, you’re sure to get a migraine after a few minutes of playing. Just about every single door isn’t accessible to the player, water might reach neck-level, yet you can sprint through it like it’s nothing, and to top it off, the lack of NPCs and life strips away the atmosphere. It’s more of a frustration test than a race against death.Fall of the Titanic really saddens me. We’ve never seen a good portrayal of the Titanic in a video game and –whether you find the concept of a game based off a tragedy appealing – you have to admit, it would be pretty cool. But this is not that game. It looks like something in an incomplete state and is in no way, shape or form, a finished product. The dev claims to provide updates each week with bug fixes, bonus content and more, but that’s the kind of thing expected from a game in early access, not a completed title.Unless you’re an enthusiast of boats or the Titanic really intrigues you, don’t waste your money."

The game is riddled with bugs, the textures look like still images taken from the ship. The fact that you die if the water touches your chin is annoying there should be a swimming/breathing mechanic, it would make the game so much more enjoyable. Speaking of enjoyable, I didn't enjoy it. The only enjoyable moment was when I pretended I was the ""King of the World"". The ship was terribly laid out, with walls and doors that make no sense, so it made it frustrating to navigate. The FOV was way to tight, couple that with the blurry textures and frame drops, well you might just throw up. So the TL;DR is buy it if you want to pretend you're the ""King of the World"" or Just don't bother. I did make a video on it, if you care to give it a watch.

Plus, as of this writing it is the only game on Steam that lets you explore the Titanic. However, whatever engine it's using is bad and uses up way too much memory for what little graphics it puts out. Details are low, distance rendering is close, it takes forever to load, and tends to crash. Good news it because it's beta, they are improving on it constantly."

Moving in the game is ...unplesent, to say the least, the headbob is not a fun thing to endure. I dont get motion sick, never have but this had me thinking oh god this is awful, its extremely disorienting and unpleasant even if you don't get motion sickThe game is also atrocious graphically, it was the 1st thing that stood out to me from  THaG since that is running on unreal 4, I have played the tech demo of THaG and was wondering what in the hell happened,I've never really understood the term or would describe a games textures as ""flat textures"" But I can tell you I understand what they are now. Textures in many places are frankly nonexistent simply usually flat colours, but I have a concept of texture work, I have done 3d modeling and I don't think what looking at in some cases are texture-less polygons, I say in some case because alot of the in game objects (in the 20 minutes I played) were texture-less as well. There are also plenty of in game objects with 0 depth to them, just a flat polygon that ""vanishes"" at certain anglesI didn't get much into the gameplay since frankly once I realized this is not what I thought it was I shut down. From what ive seen it has a free explore mode and an escape mode where you need to escape the sinking ship, both modes are totally lifeless with 0 NPCs Escape mode has you trying to get from the bottom cabins to the top of the ship,From what ive seen of what I briefly played this involves finding the object in the small area you can explore to unlock the next area you can explore.  One you do it once there seems to be 0 point to playing again, also as you can imagine a ship like this is filled with cabins the game informs you that you can open doors with the ""e"" key at which point you go along trying to open every identical looking cabin door only to find none of them open, other then the one with the floating text boxes saying ""you need a tool to get in here its locked""  making the exploration pointless if the game continues in such a manner, and infuriating if it doesn't since every door looked identical to one another and only 1 could actually be opened.Anyways refunded this without any hesitation. I recommend others not waste their time."

Despite the low quality of the graphics, textures, etc, it still manage to make a good game experience. A lot of people seem to compare this game, to the Titanic-honor and glory, game, which isn't really fair. Any Titanic game usually includes the same settings, the sinking etc. And while we haven't seen anything from Honor and glory, other than a small tech demo, for more than 5 years, this game provides us with an actual playable demo. With a lot more to explore, puzzles to be solved and a lot more fun to be had, while rushing through the sinking ship. Something is to be said about the phrase ' keep it simple'  Yes, people are all about graphics these days, usually me included. But if we are going to compare the two demos, Honor and glory gave us a beautiful tour of some of the settings... That very quickly became boring, after wandering about the same small locations, over and over.. Since there was nothing else to do other than gaze at the graphics... This game doesn't look it's best, sure, but you very quickly forget about the graphics, when you're stressing out, trying to work your way through the sinking ship, in a dark and atmospheric environment, with the water, rising right behind you. This game does a very good job at drawing you in, and keeping you on your toes to survive. The few downsides of this game isn't about graphics, but the controls that once in a while can seem a bit off. But it's nothing that will ruin the players overall experience. And let's all keep in mind, that this is still a very early stage. So I'm sure we'll see some graphic updates in the future. But for now, This is a great minigame, that people should definitely try out, and take it for what is , and not compare this to anything else out there. Have fun guys !"

The sinking mode would be better if the ship broke in half, and it would be nice if you could like watch the water rise through the interior (the grand staircase, smoking room) without the worry of drowning or not completing the story.Anotherthing, is there a way you could add a way of, when sinking to stand on deck without no-clip? That would be great! Also, why is it so dark? Titanic had millions of lightbulbs, and espically in first class, it feels like the dining room had closed (even though irl it hadn't). Finally, I know work needs to be done on this but could you make it so the player can walk around the ship at the start and see the iceberg from different perspectives? And in relation to that topic, be able to explore titanic before it comes to the iceberg (I mean like being able to enter the FIrst Class staircase, go to the dining room etc.) as that would be great.

(It's the only thing I found interesting)Alright, I'm sure the dev(s) did put some effort into this but I can't recomend it as it is right now.Here's what I Believe should be fixed for my review to change.- The rendering is absolute crap, The water is set to a specific distance and rotate around the camera which makes it very annoying. Then you have the amount of parts of the ships that aren't rendered when you walk in and outside of the ship.  It is fustrating.- The collision and modelling is pretty bad too,  if you ain't carefull you could get stuck in the floor or between walls.- No mouse lock! Seriously?  This is a First person game,  I have a second screen,  The mouse isn't lock in the middle of the screen.  When I walk around I can see my mouse moving on my second screen which (if I have the bad luck to click on the mouse button) will get me out of the game, right on my desktop. (that's the most fustrating issue I have so far)I would recommend the Dev to either find a way to lock the mouse at the middle of the screen when the player walks around.  Or Jail the cursor within the Game window.- The model of the titanic is quite messy,  You often end up finding stairs that are blocked by a random ceiling. That's pretty bad too.  I would either remove the stairs or add some fence or something.- The titanic doesn't sink properly.  I don't care if it don't break in two part but it shouldn't sink nearly flat in the water.  I think the animation was done right in the ""sinking"" mode. why can't it be done right in the ""Explore"" mode??Other than that, the movements aren't very good but I can live with it.I want to play the game once this is fixed."

And before you say ""It's probably your computer"", it isn't. I have the recommended specs... literally those are my specs.The gameplay... well it could be fun but the constant freezing and stuttering ruins it. The exploration mode ,in my opinion, is terrible. It takes lots of unneeded effort to cause the ship to sink, and when it sinks, it will sink in 4-5 minutes and won't actually sink properly - it doesn't crack in half.What makes the game even worse is that there's been no updates for a year now - the developer has completely abandoned it with the excuse of ""temporarily being unable to work on the game"". I don't even know why i'm leaving this review because you can't even buy the game anymore and I doubt you ever will be.If this was still being worked on, i'd probably give it a 4/10.

The game menu is very simple with two options. I tried to open ‘exploration mode’ three times. On each occasion it loaded for a few minutes and then crashed the game. This left me with ‘escape mode’. This could be re-named locked door simulator. You spawn on one of the decks of the titanic while the water level slowly rises around you. There are corridors of doors to cabins but none open. You end up running through the corridors hoping you don’t get stuck in some glitch. There is very little interaction for an adventure game and the graphics are too poor to rate it high for visual effect only. I hope there is a further update to fix these problems and I would give this game another try but in its current state it’s a no from me. 3/10 (I liked the water).

It has a nice Escape Mode which is basically a ""Escape from the Ship before the rooms flood and you drown"" type of mode, but it is still fun and can get pretty challenging at some points (especially the darker areas.) Then they have the Exploration Mode which I can't seem to load at this time so I'll edit this review later with more info on that. Then they have the Sinkinig Mode which really doesn't serve a purpose, it's just watching the mode sink, but all in all it's a pretty fun game and since it's only a few bucks, I think you will have some fun trying to escape from the rooms. Just be aware of something (that I didn't realize when I started) that this game does NOT save your progress. Once you start, it's either play it all the way through or quit and lose your data.

Just be sure to remember that this is still in its very early stage and has a LOT more development to go through... a LOT. Small details, like needing to realize how water pressure works and that a piano would in no way be able to hold back the pressure of the ocean should be addressed, More gates that block paths than were ever actually on the ship, Engine room's being WAY too clean, and a small issue with periodically just falling through the environment, I have no doubt that these things will be fixed later in development. If a little tour of the Titanic is what you have in mind than this is very pleasant. I am looking forward to see where this goes, adding people will be fun, either like the old ""Titanic: Adventures out of Time"" remake or perhaps purely educational where you can speak to actual passengers of the titanic and learn their history. Either way, the sinking, where you were running from the water itself (though it happens far quicker that it did in reality) was thrilling, and gets you thinking about what those 2,200 passengers really went through. Its not just a familiar story, real people actually experienced this. It is definitely worth trying out, if not this early in development, then at least later on when it is finished."

,Not Recommended,414130,21095573,"Posted: 9 February, 2016",all,ViperZeroOne,"You know, I really wanted to like Fall of the Titanic.  As someone who grew up close to the water, stories of lost vessels like the Titanic and Edmund Fitzgerald filled my childhood.  I was hoping that this title would have been a fairly good (yet oddly morbid) way to experience the loss first hand.  Mind you, I knew the game would be limited, but I really didn’t expect how limited the game's experience would be.The biggest disappointment was with the linear maze.  Mind you, there really is only so much you can do with a floor plan, but it felt like most of the levels were in a straight line.  You pick up something, run up a hallway in a dash to beat the rising water, and then use that something to go to the next deck.  Either that, or you run down a hallway and find something at the end, which unlocks something there so you can go up to the next deck.  It always seemed like you were running in a straight line.  Hallways that were ""eye candy"" were also very tight, almost too tight.  They didn't look like hallways, more like afterthoughts.  They were so narrow that I'd have a hard time picturing someone actually going down them.In addition, the content in the game is so lost in a lack of detail that the developer actually has to place signage around so you can figure out the puzzles.  Running around I found signs basically giving me clues about everything.  So much so that it almost solved the “puzzles” for me.  Mind you, if you took away the signs, the puzzles would fade into the rest of the ship and be virtually impossible to figure out.  As is, I finished the escape mode in about 25 minutes.  I would have expected the game to stretch out more towards the 3 hour mark, which is about how long the actual Titanic took to sink.  It wouldn't be hard for the developer to do.  Just increase the complexity of the puzzles and slow down the rising water.  You know, make the puzzles a little more involved than find a key, open a door, go on to next level.Going on that thought, I liked the one spot where I had to move the lever to get steam (or water?) to unblock the hallway.  It was a little unrealistic, but it was a good step towards making the levels more involved.  Maybe have furniture blocking a door and you have to find a chunk of wood to use as a makeshift crowbar to clear the way.  You could have minipuzzles, like instead of just giving the player the key maybe they find something to pick the lock with and have to play a mini-game to unlock a door.  Let the player close the water-tight hatches to slow the rising water maybe.  There are many ways the levels could be more engaging.Unfortunately this game also suffers from several glaring issues.  Keeping in mind this is an early access title.  In my 45 minutes of playing I found everything from wall clipping, where I somehow ended up going through a wall and ending up in a small square room that had no exit, to menu glitches where my mouse would be invisible and any clicking would activate Exploration Mode.I have to say again, I really wanted to like this game.  I hope the developer takes this negative review as a form of constructive criticism and continues to improve the game.  That said, as the game currently stands, there is absolutely no way I can recommend it.  Keep an eye on it, definitely, but don’t buy it yet."

When I saw Fall of the Titanic come up on Steam, I grabbed it instantly and dived into the exploration mode once it was installed. The ship is pretty well built, however there are quite a few issues.You have the option of two modes - Exploration Mode and Escape Mode. Right now, Escape Mode is the only ""finished"" mode. Exploration Mode is extremely barebones. There are no other passengers or crew members on the ship, and a lot of doors are blocked off. I only tried Escape Mode once, but the one time I tried it, I ended up getting stuck in the Grand Staircase and being helpless as the water quickly rose and drowned me.The biggest problem Fall of the Titanic faces is the camera and motion blur. Even just taking a few steps, the blur gets horrendous and the camera starts swinging a bit. Start running and these issues are just multiplied. This really killed the game for me, forcing me to have to stop playing it for fear of having to go throw up. It is due to these issues, along with the issues of getting stuck in or clipping through railings, that I cannot recommend this. The game feels like it should be in Early Access and not released as a ""full"" game like it is."

Why he has not put that on the store page is beyond me and the only negative I can say about this game.It's a work in progress, and the developer is standing behind it as of right now, working hard to get the game up to a fun playable game.Is this a ""Titanic, Honor and Glory"" Rip off or clone?  Simply put, who cares!  It's not like there is not hundreds of rip offs and clones of other games.  World War two comes to mind, it's been beating to death, but I STILL love playing all of them.  Historical games are not going to have a lot of variance to it.  Simply put this game is out NOW in early access.  It allows you to explore the ship and have a fun little game built in as of right now.  I have seen the development process first hand and can tell you that this game has been IMPROVED A LOT!  I was mad at first, thinking I got screwed and was about to return it.  I am glad I did not return this game, for three simple dollars the developer has taken you on a journey into the world of Titanic.  While it's not a perfect journey yet, it's a memorable one.Explore mode is not really up to snuff yet, but it’s getting there.  Escape mode is fun to play, but still leaves you lost a lot of the time on where to go.  I guess that’s a simple complaint being you’re supposed to fill lost.   It’s just a lot of the doors don’t open and many places look like you’re supposed to go too, but are not allowed.   It makes escape mode really confusing, but just imagine how it would be if you were really trying to escape the Titanic when it was sinking.Overall I would recommend this game, if the developer continues to update and get some NPC’s down and make the ship more presentable, than I would say this game should be sold for more than three dollars.  It’s a work in progress at this point, and with that being said it should be considered that when you buy the game.  Don’t go into the game thinking it’s a full complete game, because it’s not.  As of right now, I would give this game three and half star’s out of five.  It’s a good game that can easily turn into a five star review if he continues to work and improve a lot of the visuals and game concept.   Would love to be able to open every door eventually. :-p"

,Not Recommended,414130,22642053,"Posted: 26 April, 2016",all,trivan_23,"This is a tough one to review. It's clear that a lot of effort is going into the game, but in its present state it's tough to recommend even to a Titanic fanatic. Perhaps once it's shaped up some more.- Escape Mode has promise. Indeed, the opening minutes had me genuinely unsettled with the groaning of the ship, the flickering lights, and the slowly rising water. However, it's a pretty short mode (*maybe* an hour), and most of the ""puzzles"" are either too straight forward, or too confusing. (I have one key and there are a thousand doors that don't open.) Maybe if it moved away from the puzzles, and just had you running around frantically trying to find your way up to the boat deck, that would be better. Titanic's lower decks were a labyrinth already.- Sink Mode also has promise. I'd like it better if there was some kind of series of subtitles going on to act as a timeline of events, not unlike what the TITANIC: HONOR AND GLORY team did with their simulation. However, this mode just amounts to a real time or sped up model of the Titanic sinking. And the ship doesn't even break in half.- Exploration Mode is really where I wanted the game to shine. I'd be a-okay spending three bucks to walk around a model of the Titanic, but it is *very* unstable in its current state. Even with the rendering slider bumped all the way to the top, entire decks will not render until you reach them, neither will half the ship. So if you're trying to get a look at the bow from the wheelhouse, you'll kinda just see components and a lot of empty space. It makes it very unpleasant to walk around. If the developers can't get the ship to a point where we can walk around without constant fade-ins and pop-ins, then I'd much rather just have loading screens between decks or sections of the ship. That being said, they have a great foundation here to build the rest of the ship.Definitely a mixed bag of things that don't quite work, but the developers still seem hard at work tidying things up. I'll probably revisit FALL OF THE TITANIC in the future, since it's a worthy project. However, it's just hard to recommend in its current state. The inaccuracies (ex: Liverpool being spelled on the stern as ""Liver Pool"") and its rough programming bring down something that still has a lot of potential."
76561198204233680,Recommended,414130,22577302,"Posted: 22 April, 2016",all,chris.vaughn1998,"Before I get into the review itself, I want to summarize my thoughts: There are a few flaws to the game (quite a few), but ultimately a ray of hope shines behind it. This is not meant to scorn the game but rather to inspire the game to become what it should be, because I see true potential in this game. Do not let this review deter you from this game.First, the problems.  To begin, the rendering of the game itself is rather underwhelming. Up close, detail is magnificent, but yet certain areas don't load until the character approaches close enough. For example, when in the steering wheel room or nearby it, looking out towards the bow reveals only a very scarcely rendered bow, only a mast and a couple patches of deck and so forth. This can also be a hazard, as you can easily fall through the entire ship at places. As far as I know, this only happens in Exploration Mode. While I love how in Sinking Mode there is a choice between real-time speed and fast-forward speed, there is no detectable difference between the two. In Escape Mode, there is a rather odd quality: when you die by drowning, a game over screen pops up suddenly. This really ruins the mood and makes you feel like you're playing a game made by a beginner programmer (example: an 8 year old who's made a game in Game Maker). The font it's presented in is not very fitting either. Elegant, exquisite writing doesn't exactly match up with the feeling of ""YOU ARE DEAD. GAME OVER"". Loose objects in this mode also don't start floating until a point that seems to defy physics. Also, in the pause menu during Exploration Mode, some options are partially cut off by the game's screen border so that they can't be read. And, in the main menu, there is no way to exit the options menu except for the button that quits the game. The jumping mechanic is also really weak. To jump basically means to stand on your tip-toes for a moment. One more thing: when controlling the crew member in the beginning of Escape Mode, there is a strange beacon of light right before somebody says ""Iceberg, right ahead!""Now for the pros. The game's graphics are incredibly detailed, and the water physics are fluently designed. The design of the ship itself is very faithful to its real counterpart. While they don't work, the ability to use a device of your choice (keyboard, gamepad, etc.) and the sinking speeds in Sinking Mode are very good qualities. The ambiance in Escape Mode is extremely fitting and well done (except for the game over screen).Despite its shortcomings, I think the very concept of the game is what's keeping this review as intended to be constructive criticism rather than destructive. The idea of experiencing the Titanic, both casually and during the sinking, has always been interesting to me, and I don't want this interpretation to be abandoned entirely. I would like to see some improvements be put into the game so that it lives up to its dreams. I think the Sinking Mode should also have the choice to be in either a free flying control system (as it is now) or as if you were a real human on the ship. It should also have a time gauge that you can speed up or slow down during play, rather than choosing one speed at the beginning and sticking to it. There should be a skip button for cinematic parts such as the iceberg hitting, because people may be in a rush to play as the passenger. There should also be a little breath meter so you can tell when you're about to drown. A save feature for Escape Mode would also be nice. The most important things to improve, in my opinion, are jumping and rendering. I'd say Fall of the Titanic is not quite up to what it should be yet, but it certainly could live up to expectations when enough manpower is put into it. For now though, just follow Titanic: Honor and Glory, and maybe check back on this game every now and then, but just don't give up on Fall of the Titanic entirely."

,Recommended,414130,21715254,"Posted: 8 March, 2016",all,DeanGeddes,"In comparison to some of the negative reviews, I actually think that this is quite a good game. For £1.99 we can't really complain about the price, can we? I agree with most people that it has a few bugs that are still being sorted out by the developers, but I still find it a nice game to play. If you're up for an adventure then this is the game for you. Here's some of the pros:- The game has a nice atmosphere, You feel like you are actually on the Titanic.- Graphics inside the ship are very detailed.- Expansive free roam, you can explore the whole ship.- Water detail when the ship is sinking is excellent.- Relaxing piano music plays when you are in first class lounges.- Other ship sounds are very realistic, especially when sinking.- Escape mode is interesting, it can be scary (in a good way), trying to break down doors and escape to a lifeboat.Here's some of the cons though:- Sometimes, when you look up you can just see sky above you. It is not until you actually go up the steps that the graphics then loads for the next deck.- When looking over the side of the ship, you can't see the ocean. Instead, just a blank space.- There are no other people around, it looks like a ghost ship.- Not many doors can you actually open.Aside from the bugs, it is actually quite a good game. It definitely has potential in the future, once the bugs are fixed. Did the developer price the game cheaply becuase they knew it had bugs that needed to be fixed? We will never know. But in conclusion, I recommend this game, if you are up for an adventure.WARNING: Do not assume that becuase it is cheap, it will probably be low quality and run on slow PC's. This game requires you have at least 8GB of RAM, or at least 12 (like I do) if you want it to run well."

I wouldnt really call it a simulation because the ship does not sink in realtime  ,at least in escape mode which is pretty linear. I couldnt get sink mode to work, the ship just wouldnt sink. plus you dont get to be on the boat while its sinking anyways its just a fly camera. Pros are the graphics exept for the layout of the boat which is really bad looking. I think the game is a good idea I just think it would be way cooler to actually be escaping from a boat sinking in real time, AKA no loading screens and such."

No offence to the Dev but I look at it as a filler before Titanic: Honor and Glory is released. The Dev has been releasing regular updates so far since the game launched on Steam which is nice and unexpected.  I honestly expected to pay for the game and it be the same until Titanic: HG launched with no new updates. Kudos to him... I'm also finding myself getting interested to see what else gets improved on, changed and added. So far I've been really impressed.Explore mode from what I've seen on the forums takes a good computer to run. Alot of people complain that it does not work however, I have no issues with running it on my PC especially since recent updates have improved overall FPS and performance of the game. My specs are 500 GB SSD, AMD Radeon R9 290 (with 4gb of onboard memory) graphics, Intel Core i5 quad @ 3.50ghz and 16 GB of RAM if you were wondering. I believe this is a ship modelled by 1 person so of course the graphics are not going to be magnificient or anything, but in my opinion, it is not too bad. However I do have some feedback for the Dev,1. When going down the Grand Staircase from D-deck to E-deck, it seems the environment isn't as seemless as it should be as the entire staircase textures change at one point on the stairs causing confusion the first few times I experienced it.2. There needs to be more doors that can be opened and staircases which are functional. I'm not talking about cabins, I'm talking about just in general to get around the corridors. I've noticed several spots where the top of the staircase is sealed or a door that should be there to let you pass through to another area is not functional (or is not even present). Biggest area where this is a problem is the Grand Staircase on the upper decks.3. Probably my biggest pet peeve... WHY ARE THE WINDOWS ON THE BRIDGE TEXTURED? Change these to plain glass windows please!For me, I've always been a nerd for early 1900s steamships but most notably the Titanic as I grew up in a city which is famous for facilitating the passage of immigrants into North America and which played host to many of the famous liners including Olympic. I never really studied the interiors of these ships nor did I really appreciate the grand interiors... Being able to wander them for Titanic in this game allows me to see somewhat what it was like and to gain some ability in being able to navigate within the ship or to know where certain spaces fell within the ship. This offers a new perspective on things and I feel I've really gained a new respect for the ship that I didn't have when I was younger. Just to explore the various areas that are modelled in this mode is worth the money to me.Since people expect me to mention it, yes, in Explore mode you can sink the ship... No, the ship doesn't sink as it should or break in half. The ship at most has an angle in the water of around 5 degrees I'd say... which means the aft of the superstructure (near the stern behind the 4th funnel) is the last to go under water. It's similar to how another game (Ship Simulator 2008) worked without mods or bugs when your ship sunk. I would like to see the following improvements: water improved like it recently was in Escape mode and objects actually floating during flooding. I'd like to see the sinking angle improved. It would also be nice to have some way to change the skybox in Explore mode to different times (night, morning, afternoon, evening).Escape mode is an interesting type of puzzle, it can be challenging at times but its pretty straight forward. I enjoyed my one and only run through it, I don't really plan to continue using it unless something major changes to make me want to try it again. To be honest, the game could probably do without it and the resources could have been spent improving the other modes.Sinking mode (a new mode where you can fly around a model of the ship as it sinks either in real time or accelerated time) is one of my favorite features. No, you can't see the ship split in half... however, for an indy-made simulation, it's pretty spot on... the developer even got the ships list to port in there which is pretty cool. The model is fairly detailled, however there are some areas where it is a bit lacking. For the lit port holes, you can clearly see they are balls of light sticking out of the side of the ship. On the tip of the bow on the Port side you can see where a porthole texture is partially visible where it definitely shouldn't be. The ship also does not have any propellers which you can clearly see when it raises out of the water and the bridge is not very detailed and there is no crows nest on the foreward mast. Also the Starboard side seems more detailed then the port side. I think this is because the model being used is the same model that you start on in Escape mode... In Escape mode, you start on the starboard boat deck and walk to the Bow of the ship so I think the dev figured most people wouldn't take the time to go over to the Port side so more time was spent making sure the Starboard side was as detailed as possible. All in all though, I like this mode and I would love to see more improvements made to the overall model and more functionality added to it to make a player be able to have more interaction with it.I would recommend this game if you have interest in the Titanic and wish to explore it a bit in a game. I would not recommend this if you're expecting an AAA built game with amazing graphics and effects and a reenactment of the Titanic 1997 movie before your very eyes."

Also, the ship doesn't appear to get much steeper during the sinking, resulting in even the very back of the ship being quite flooded towards the end.For $3 or less, not a terrible purchase I can say atleast."
