I got completely misled by the other reviews. It's all a sham. Go to the subreddit for this game. It looks like a bunch of fake accounts made by the developers. The whole thing seems fishy to me. Who cares if it's a clone? We all like these sorts of games. The issue is that it's a BAD clone.There is no point to the game, there are no bosses, there is no story. You build a house and raise some animals. This alone would be fine, I'm a HUGE fan of games like Stardew Valley, however, the mechanics and gameplay are not intuitive, poorly explained, and once you understand them, they are poorly balanced.This game feels very amateurish, and I get the feeling from reading around online that not only does nobody actually play it extensively, but that the company posts all over getting fake reviews. The whole thing seems VERY suspicius that such an obviously poor quality game has such high reviews.Do NOT buy this game, it would be a waste."

Yes it is but there are enough differences to make me happy with it not being some annoying knock off. It has a couple similarities to minecraft too.-blocks are bigger, so for me its easier to get around.-also lots of blocks to craft for building so its like minecraft to like that.-not as boss killing driven as Terraria. More collection driven. There still are mobs to kill. Don't worry. And there are bosses.-I love how you can collect tons of animals and even fish and make a fishtank with the fish.-You travel to different planets to find better ores/gear from mobs.-You find most of your crafting patterns in crates in your world, so keep searching :) or you can ""cheat"" and look on the try to look them up.I would say before you run saying its a knock off. Play it a while and give it a chance. The problem I have with it is there's just not a lot of info out there about it. And the game doesn't teach you a lot. So I think some people jump in and get confused and can't find stuff when they try to look it up.Overall I love this game. The devs are still working on it and I would say totally give it a try if you like Terraria or Minecraft type games."

It looked like a cross between Minecraft, Terraria, Blockheads, and a little bit like craft the world.  Except, those games are fun.  Junk Jack looked like a great game.  But, it's not.  First, the mobs are tiny.  You basically run around swinging your weapon the entire time underground.  It is also just extrememly easy to find stuff.  I think I had the portal to the next world within 2 to 3 hours.  And that was almost all mining underground.  There weren't any traps or powerful mobs or bosses gaurding the pieces.  You basically run in and snatch it.So basically-Good:polished graphicsmultiple worlds is a cool ideaBad:tiny mobstoo easywierd meny/inventory thingIf any of you want to try the game out go ahead.  I probably only actually have 10-12 hours actually playing the game since I let it idle a lot.  I'm going back to playing fun games."

I find this game to be challenging at times, yet relaxing as well. The uber mobs are quit fun, I have only downed the first one (had to start over after I discovered by mistake not to let TNT explode near the summon thing) at which time I died many times over. I was brand new, so it was a noob mistake.  This game may not be for everyone, but there are sooo many different tiles to use to build with, interect with and just have fun. Play how you want, either in creative mode or normal. Enjoy the game for what it is. Similar to Terraria but different enough that you don't feel like your playing a copy."
,Recommended,414190,22821785,"Posted: 5 May, 2016",all,Symbiote,"INTRODUCTION:At first glance, you may think that Junk Jack looks like a clone of a much more popular game, Terraria. While the similarities are there, I'd argue that this game's intentions are much different, and the art style is the similar aspect. If you're familiar with Terraria, Minecraft and Starbound, Junk Jack would be its child, introducing all the neat elements of each of those indie games.PROS:- More content than expected on Early Access.- Fun graphic/art style.- Music is well done (I have a con for this though.)- Multiplayer (however, it's a con currently as well.)- Wide variety of biomes and monsters.- Many things to collect in the game.- Simple AND advanced crafting for inexperienced or experienced sandbox-game players.- Weather system.- Good variety of settings for all areas of the game.- When your character falls in water, you're not limited to try to jump out of water. You can control swimming around with WASD.- Combat strafing with the CTRL key.CONS:- Combat is too simple, thus making fighting monsters challenging. Limited to a single strike, it's difficult to push back enemies and not be hit with a massive amount of damage.- Music is great when it's there, but often the game's music will stop playing for some time.- Multiplayer is currently experimental, and comes with bugs. Attempted doing a Steam game with a friend, didn't work. We eventually connected to eachother by IP through a router, but experienced some random disconnects every now and then.- Sound effects sound out of place, the quality of the effects don't blend well with the atmosphere of the game.- The price tag. Personally, for the current stage, I think $15.00 is asking for a little much. I'd price this game at $10.00.CONCLUSION:Steam has been plagued with many Early Access games, and many of them have turned out to be flunks. From what I can tell though, the Junk Jack developers are committed and have come to Steam with a fairly polished game. Updates seem to be frequent as well, and they listen to those who are interested in the game. Junk Jack, in my mind, is a good purchase if you enjoy indie sandbox adventure games.RATING:I'd give Junk Jack a score of 9/10 for now. In my mind, $1 = 1 hour of entertainment. I can see myself spending more than fifteen hours with this game. Happy building!EDITS:- No longer have the invisible wall as a con, as a patch added a world loop to replace it.- No longer have the Steam achievements as a con, because a patch has fixed them to work now."
,Not Recommended,414190,34045443,Posted: 5 August,all,Kasavara,"Junk Jack is a combination of Terraria and No Man's Sky. The concept was interesting, but the implementation is lackluster.GAMEPLAYInteresting for the first 3 portals, until you realize that every portal is the same as where you first spawned - just different colors, slightly different looking mobs (even though they function the same), and slightly different blocks for decoration.Unlike Terraria, you dig underground in any portal, look for a glowing orb with a skull in it, crack it open with a hammer(or dig the block below the orb), and fight the boss. It's really easy to kill every boss. I useda rare drop weapon from the Terra boss (world you spawn in) to kill bosses until I got a faster weapon that also had lifesteal.This method works for every single boss and I never felt a need to upgrade. The only real reason I changed equipment was for the luck bonus. Bosses also have no real special ability either. When you spawn the boss, they spawn with fairly harmless mini-mobs and the scariest thing the boss does is break blocks with a ranged attack.The ores are useful for tools (pickaxes and shovels) and nothing else. You'll never really need to fish, or use a bow and arrow. In fact, it's a lot easier to just play this game full melee anyway since the bosses can just dig away from you anyway.Healing items are next to useless since you're only really hit when a mob literally walks upto you.Portal pieces aren't that hard to find, either. I played this game with my girlfriend on the largest possible world and sky we could set, and it still only took upto 1 hour per portal. The last 2 portals had their chests extremely close to each other which made it way too easy.Crafting seems like it's going to take forever if you use simple mode because yourequirethe recipe to make something. Just switch into the advanced mode and use the wikipedia. 95% of the recipes you find won't be what you're looking for, and there's over 250 to find. That's overkill and definitely not necessary.Encrusting is something that becomes important if you want the game to be faster and easier, but not necessary since a lot of the equipment and weapons you get as drops are already over powered in comparison to the monsters you face.GRAPHICSPolished and clean with a Terraria-esque feel. Nothing much to say about them.OVERALLI don't suggest it. I'd rather just replay Terraira instead. This game becomes too repetitive and is simply too boring."

This game is probably the best IOS port I have ever seen!Yes, you heard that right, it's a IOS port,withoutMicrotransactions or ginormous UI's.Most of the complaints i've seen were from low playtime. Give this game a chance people!People say this looks like terraria, even though the very first game (simply named junk jack) launched about 2-3 monthsBEFOREterraria.As for a review, buy it. The price may seem steep, but if you have played the game before or are new, it's a good game. I'll give it a 4.5/5.(Not 5/5 due to some very minor bugs :3)Update 9/26/16:Seeing as this is currently the top review, i fell like i need to put more game stuff in here.The game is a 2D exploration/building sandbox game, with no story except ""Get portal peices, go to next planet, repeat untill all planets are done"". It has aBUNCHof items to collect, and most of it doesn't have a use (hench the ""junk"" part of junk jack), but that's the whole point of this game, collecting rare and unusual stuff. There are monsters, but right off the bat you can tell combat isn't the focus at all.I reccomend this game to anyone willing to pay the, currently, $15 price tag and actualy play the game longer than 2 hours."

I purchased this game so that me and my nephews can play the game together and explore the other worlds together. Little did I know that you can not use planet portals in multiplayer. The host would have to go in on single player than invite others to the world. That is a BIG issue and quite frankly there should be some kind of feedback from the creators to let potential buyers know that multiplayer is limited to just the first planet you spawn on. For me that is a game killer and I wont be playing anymore of the game until multiplayer is the main focus of an update and released. Its rediculous that this game has been around since 2013ish and even back then multiplayer was the same way? 3 years and no multiplayer content, tweaks, or adjustments? This game should not be listed as full multiplayer because it is not. It is Semi-Multiplayer and I feel like they are false advertising the game. So if you are looking for a single player game to get into then this is a good game to get. If you are getting it for multiplayer then move on to a different game because you will be disappointed."
,Recommended,414190,30380000,Posted: 7 March,all,Sashie,"I quite like this game. Its like terraria or starbound for people with bad computers. Worlds load really fast on default settings.There are quite a few negatives however or things some might find to be negatives.1. Only 1 accessory slot and accessories are hard to craft.2. Pets are only vanity when equiped.3. Your only allowed 1 defensive potion buff at a time.4. Its uses minecraft Light level decides spawning instead of Terraria player placed blocks prevent spawing.5. Every planet feels like they use the same terrain generation on the surface with a different splash of paint6. A ton of enemies very obviously share the same AI7. You can't search crafts by item used in it (like searching wood widget and see every craft involving it).8. No in game help or clues how to make potions (And quite a few potion ingrediants are rare drops).9. Items fly into open hotbar slots (very annoying when farming)10. No crafting while doing something else (similar to 7 days to die) to take some pain out of simple crafting.11. No bosses or epic boss loot.12. Lava destroys all items, no matter how important like portal pieces.13. Buckets don't stack14. Tons of animals you'd think you could tame but cannot like boars, foxes, squirrels, ect.15. No Npcs to live with you like terraria/starbound. Or shop keepers.16. Tons of food everywhere, but no hunger or thirst even on the hardest difficulty.17. Tons of farm animals, but no horses or mounts.18. Early game its easy to feel like your not progressing due to ore rarity. My second planet I unlocked was seth where I basically just found the same ores as terra.19. Best ore for planet type are VERY VERY RARE.20. Low Tool durability and slow mining speed. (even titanium tools feel like they break too quickly relative to how rare thier ores are)21. Sometimes the music just stops for long periods of time.22. You can craft a clock, but carrying it won't display the time like terraria/project zomboid.23. When crafting it won't take into consideration whats in nearby chests.24.Animals just instantly respawn if you leave an area and return so long as there is grass and its day (similiar to old school minecraft). So you can get all the cow, boar, bacon, ect meat and leather you want in a jiffy.25. Enemies can't break doors. And can only get you if they spawn inside your base due to light levels.26. Rare Treasure don't do anything, can't be sold, and don't say anything on them.27. Things often have to be used or worn to add to collection.28. No cool accesory granted abilities like teraria.29. no repairing or enchanting items.30. Ladders can only be placed from the bottom up. And ladder climb speed is terribly slow Vs minecraft ladders or terraria's ropes.That out of the way. This game has hundreds of blue print pages to find (Just a shame none of them list potion recipies) that show you how to craft things so you don't need a wiki like you do with minecraft. And theres a lot of planets to explore. Some end game enemies hit very hard on hardest difficulty settings, like 50% of my hp in a single hit in full unencrusted  titanium armor. Undead burn in sunlight, animals drown in water, lava kills most things (but sadly destroys all drops). Theres a large number of redstone like items to create (more than i've seen in unmodded minecraft or terraria). You can farm (Though its extremely easy and requires no watering. But getting seeds can be quite hard for things like fruit trees), raise animals (more demanding), go fishing, hunt down the MANY MANY rare drop items, try to collect all the portal pieces to visit all 12 worlds (Not that you need too to reach end tier). Collect every treasure, all clothing, every pet, ect."

A LOT. You spend more time traveling back to the surface repeatedly do make things than exploring. My solution was to just keep my crafting supplies and thing in my inventory and not have a base or home which doesn't work well since there are small inventories. This isn't like other games of the sort (I have them all) with terraria there's recall potions or magic mirrors, starbound has ship teleport, Crea has warp stones so you can just teleport back to your house, Minecraft is a small world and not entirely based underground so this isn't an issue.-Combat is♥♥♥♥♥♥ You get a few bland tiny attack radius weapons and enemys that either slowly walk towards you and can never hit you, or throw things that dont do jack♥♥♥♥♥♥ You can get through the entire game without a weapon bcus you can place blocks almost anywhere on your screen and just block them off and kill them with lava or ignore them.-What's the point? its to collect items and get better equipment but there's no final goal it's just becoming a horder and mining for hours that isn't fun since combat is♥♥♥♥♥♥-Portals, the way to travel planets is to find  portal chests and once you get three you get a portal to another world, except when you press M it brings up a map that shows ALL LIGHT SOURCES EVEN IF YOU HAVN'T SEEN THE ARE YET WITHIN LIKE 50 BLOCKS OR MORE (you're 1 block large it's a large area around you that you can see on the map). which means all loot areas and portal chests (they glow) are basically mapped out for you, there goes the exploration part, the only thing this game had left.This game MIGHT be worth wasting some time on if it was free never buy this game get any others, Crea, Starbound, Terraria, Dig or Die 2, Minecraft, and if you've played all these and other worthwhile games of the type like I have don't waste your money on this."

From the Graphics, Music and Game World, Junk Jack delivers on all of my expectations that I had when I first heard that the game was coming to PC. For the more fine details, see my list of Pros and Cons below:PROS:-Smooth Gameplay and Framerate-Awesome Graphics-Good Music-Addictive Nature (wanting to collect craftbook pages & explore the underground biomes)-Multiplayer (still experimental)-Unique Biomes and world (monsters)-Literally hundreds of crafting recipies (foods, crafting benches, armor, weapons, clothes, houses as well as treasure to collect)CONS:-Slightly awkward control scheme at first, but you get used to it-No Gamepad Support (as of yet)-Price may put off people from buying itOverall, I'd say that the game is worth the $15 price tag considering it's being developed by two guys, who had to essentially remake the game for PC. Either way, you be the judge!NOTE:The game has/had some issues starting on Windows 7 for me, as well as other users. The Developers released a list of potential fixes on their blog as well as a patch that fixed any and all issues that I was having, so I think that it's now stable on all operating systems.Here's the link just incase:https://pixbits.wordpress.com/2016/04/27/troubleshooting-junk-jack-issues/Be sure to give it a try!"

It has more pixel crack than a pixelated back alley in Pixel New York City. Tons of rares, recipes, etc. Explore, build up an awesome base, gather all the pixel crack. It's a relaxing way to just dig around and catch 'em all.This game also has a ton of crafting recipes, farming, and an extensive gardening system. If you like fighting mega bosses, stick with Terraria. If you like 3D, stick with Minecraft. If you like hundreds of chests filled with all the junk, because you should be the star of a Let's Play Hoarders youtube episode, then this is the game for you.Pro tip: build your base on one world, and then ""exit"" the game and go to another world to do all your digging / exploring. You can switch back and forth between worlds as much as you want. If you're digging deep in to dangerous areas, carry a stack of beds, and periodically drop a bed, then use it to change your spawn point. This'll greatly reduce the distance you have to run after you get killed.UPDATE, May 9, 2017 - Still loving this game. Took a break for a few months, came back after the Uber Mob update. Love the new bosses, love finding totems, and the overall junk drop rate is vastly improved. Actually making progress on my collection!

Otherwise feel free to read all that i have hereDon't be discouraged by the negative reviews comparing this game to Terraria. This is actually a very well made game which developers have been updating regularly since the original release of the game on IOS a few years ago. I will, however, give a brief overview of what the gameplay consists of and what you can expect to find as opposed to terraria.-Junk Jack is a ""play your way"" kind of game with various difficulty settings to from peaceful, which is a casual players setting, to very hard, which is the most challenging game mode featuring hordes of enemies which will kill you and make you drop everything once you die (once its dropped, its lost). Terraria, on the other hand, forces the player to fight enemies throughout the game.-Junk Jack is focused more towards looting rare items, weapons, and armor from enemies and chests where terraria is focused more on the fighting. Terraria players seek to collect mainly weapons and armor from defeating enemies and collecting ores from their underground spelunking.-Junk Jack now uses a very similar armor layout to terraria where there are ""in effect"" slots and ""vanity"" slots. So, say you have a piece of armor which gives you a stat boost you simply cannot go on without but its just so horrendously ugly. You can wear something you like in your vanity slot which will allow you to keep the stats of the armor while looking the way you like.-Junk Jack has a HUGE crafting system. Half of all the things that can be made will be crafted from one of the crafting tables which also have to be crafted. This crafting system brings alot of the excitement into the game because the players can search for the items down below ground required to craft it and maybe face off against a few enemies to obtain a rare piece needed to craft the objects. Terrarias crafting system is much smaller in comparison and players will be more concerned with crafting better weapons due to the nature of the gameplay.-Money is not an object in Junk Jack. You are the only human character in the game aside from other PC's playing with you in a multiplayer game. No NPC's. Everything is available to you but you have to find it or make it yourself. You can trade with players for items you need if you have something you can give to them in return.-Junk Jack has a creative mode which allows you to build whatever you like how you like it. You can design a house exactly how you would want, or maybe test a contraption design to keep the monsters at bay.Of course I didn't include everything which separates the two games but these reasons are what I feel distinguishes them most.For those of you who skipped to the end:Both games are 2d sandbox platformers with a wide range of weapons, armor, and blocks for you to build with.Junk Jack has more blocks, weapons, armor, and enemies than Terraria. Terraria is a tactful enemy grinding game with bigger bosses and more interesting weapons. If you want a HUGE sandbox game with freedom to do just about anything, go ahead and buy this, its well worth the money. If you want to fight off enemies and bathe in the glory of defeating moonlord on solo, play Terraria."

The developer is positive and engages with concerns as soon as they can, and I will give a thumbs up to ANY game on Steam that shows the amount of passion and dedication that PixBits SRL shows for its customers.  Seriously, even recently released games in this genre that I won't name (PC, there's a hint) could learn a lot from these guys.For now, Junk Jack is in the process of transitioning to PC from IOS, but it isn't your typical copy and paste port.  They're taking it seriously, from every angle imagineable.

,Recommended,414190,22692960,"Posted: 28 April, 2016",all,saltmummy626,"Junk Jack was probably the best game on the Ipod touch/Iphone. This game is a port of it's sequel, Junk Jack X, to the PC. It controls well enough, but some of the manuvers that made moving around in the original version are impossible thanks to the lack of touch controls. The trade off to keyboard is well worth that sacrifice though. The main pull to Junk Jack, at least for me, is not the digging or the crafting or all the standard crafting game features. It's the fat loot. Useless, decorative trinkets that can be found all over the place and displayed prominantly on shelves, tables, and display cases. Junk Jack (X) appears to have toned down the drop chances of these bits of loot, which makes them all the more precious when you find them. The game has a large amount of these useless trinkets, hence the name ""Junk Jack."" Junk Jack (X) comes with a couple new features as far as the series is concerned. One of those is character customization, another is multiplayer. I have not tried the multiplayer yet, so no comment on it from me. Apparently, Junk Jack (X) has other planets you can visit, but I have yet to see them, though from video and screenshots, they look pretty good.Junk Jack is a naturally very quiet game, with little bits of music popping in infrequently to break up the silence. Ambient noise is provided by nearby creatures such as birds, cats, dogs, cows, sheep, pigs, deer, bears, boar, rats, zombies, skeletons, slimes, etc. etc. etc. The number of creatures their are to mutilate is fantastic.One major issue I have though, is the price tag. Junk Jack (X) is a decent investment of around 5$, On the PC it would be a decent buy for 7 or 8 bucks. Junk Jack for PC costs 15$. Fifteen dollars doesn't seem like a lot, but for a game like Junk Jack, it is a lot. I'd put junk jacks price tag at the low end of ""overpriced."" I have a metaphorical ""bin"" where I put overpriced games, Junk Jack would be resting right on the edge of that bin, staring down at games like prison architect, clockwork empires, Age of Empires 3, that game where you are trying to escape from prison that I am having trouble remembering the name of, and oblivion while I sit nearby trying to decide whether to push Junk Jack into the bin or not.Oh yeah, and another issue? Junk Jack released compiled for windows 10, so most people couldn't play it right away until pixbits (the developer) released a patch. The patch came quick, but the damage was done. To Pixbits credit though, they have been running damage control very effectively, being fairly polite to people with issues, and helping as best they can.I recommend this game, but I also caution you. Think long and hard if 15$ is what you want to pay for this game."

I did not hesitate to get the early access of the game to support the devs that work hard on this series.I can't really play the PC version more than a couple of mins because of frustrations of 2 main things.  I will explain because those who haven't played the IOS version may not understand completely.1. When you make a path downward into the ground, you will basically make a staircase looking structure out of the stone and dirt you've carved out.  This allows you to freely press the left or right to go downwards with ease.  In the IOS version, going back UP this same path just requires you pressing left or right...in the PC version you have to wear out your space bar to jump up and up and up.  Terraria allows you to walk back up the path the same way you went downward, so this should follow that control model in my opinion.2.  The reach of a pickaxe, let me explain.  When they made the PC version, after it was so far along they upgraded the IOS version to match that same structure of what made the PC version.  Before the PC version, let's say I was using the very common iron pickaxe, it would reach at least 2-3 spaces away....it might not sound like much, but when decending into areas it becomes VERY useful.  The hammer, of the same metal, would also reach that far away.  Since then, the PC version and now the IOS version both limit the pickaxe to only the adjacent blocks.  And I honestly thought the problem was me at first in the IOS version, but then I built a hammer of the same metal and was able to hit blocks further away than just the adjacent ones.movement and main functions of a game are critical, and maybe some might like the way this PC version feels.  I REALLY want to like it so very much, but I just can't recommend long play times in this version as it sits now.  I really hope the developers read this and consider, if nothing else, the option to change the movement up the stairlike block structures at the very very least.Other than those thoughts, I like the work you do and enjoy your games very much.  Sure some might complain about the price, but I would always buy the full recipe book and the mining helmet in the IOS version which starts to add up.  I really like the IOS games and they are literally the games that have stayed on my phone being played longer than any other app or game on my phone.If the main controls are fixed then I'll change my recommendation to Yes, the reach of the pickaxe might be a bug for all I know."

It is sort of like it, just without a lot of things.I really like how there are different dimensions you can travel to, but it is a challenge to get the fragments to make the portal. Its not like Minecraft where you can get to the Nether in like 30 minutes. You have to work for it, which it great. At the point that I am writing this review, I have 15 hours on the game. I will continue to play this game and log more hours.-------My point:This game is challenging to people who don't want to spend a good amount of time working on getting somewhere. This is not a game for those people. I would still recommend this game to most people. Hats of to you, PixBits."

Well maybe from screenshots but it does not play like Terraria. It has its own rythm and play style. I didn't know if I would like it but 70+ hours later I'm still going strong and want to ""dig"" in more! Plenty to craft, explore, and collect! and there are pets! (anyone who knows me, knows for me its all about the collecting and pets!) Plenty of challenges but nothing that gave me more silver fox lining on the top knot like some games (Cough*The Long Dark or Feel the Snow *cough*cough*). FYI the bosses or ""Mini"" bosses I have come across give you a run for your money. I was not prepared. Died. Died again lol. But Whoot! long as I didnt log off I could find and retrieve my stuff! Booya!There really are only a few things that have been a ""CON"" for me thus far - 1) those penned animals have bottomless stomachs and are always hungry (geeze pace yourselves guys! thank the stars I dont have to shovel poop), 2) Not a fan on how the armor/weapon stats are displayed. Really REALLY hard to read stats and figure out what the heck they are to compare pieces (Which is truly an upgrade?), and 3) a way to track tamed animals to collect (which might be there I just haven't seen it yet).Bottom line - Lovin it. Can't wait for more. :) I see myself playing till all those achievements are filled. <3"

I think that the two devs have done a great job of making a game similar to Terraria, MInecraft and Starbound (which I've all played for many hours) and it has great content. It's an iOS port but a good one. I really recommend this game to anyone fond of any of the top three games I've mentioned. However the combat system is a little overly simple but good animations anyway.Really good game."

We built said portals and got the message ""Portals not available in multiplayer YET"". OMG !!!Did some searching and found that it has been this way since multiplayer was introduced around 2013.There are work arounds - server player jumps to single player and takes a portal to another planet, then reloads in multiplayer, but that seems like a real pain, especially when your base with all you resources is now inaccessable unless the host goes through the process again....I like the game alot, just hope they fix the multiplayer."

Ive played it since IOS in 2011 and I have never felt dissapointed. The developers Jack and XsX pour so much personality into this little game that its insane! Some may argue that its a rip-off of Terraria, This is completely false. Terraria was launched on May 16, 2011, while Junk Jack Retro was relesed on Nov 7, 2011. As you can see Junk Jack was already in development before Terraria was a thing. Any Terraria fan knows that the game focuses on combat and gear progression and adventure. In my opinion, Junk Jack focuses on exploration, collecting, crafting, and the previously mentioned aspects to a lesser extent. Junk Jack is an absolute delight to play, and if any of these sound like your cup of tea, by all means, I suggest you try this game."
