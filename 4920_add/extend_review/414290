My first playthrough took me 45 minutes exploring every single room. Prices for items are steep and resources are scarce if you want to open every crate and door. This would have been fine if the game just had gone on for a bit longer.All in all there's just not enough effort put into this to release it with a price tag. It's close and everything's functional, but it needs more."

The items and artifacts are varied but there are only a hand full of enemies that provide little challenge. I hope to see this game a bit more fleshed out.

It's an easy platform with nothing new, you could enjoy a run, just out of curiosity, then you could do another one hoping that it will surprise you some way, but it doesn't happen and there's no reason to keep playing.This has a pure roguelike style, there's no kind of progress, when you die you are done, you unlock nothing, you don't achieve anything, and this totally kills every interests.I won't say the game isbad, it just has no reason to exist. It's nothing better thana lotof other games of the same genre. There'snothingnew, and there's no effort, no character in its concepts.Conclusions:If you think you could like this game, just buy Rogue Legacy, it's way better. If you already played Rogue Legacy, then look for something else. There's no much content in the game, and that's ok, considereing the price, but even if this game was free there's no quality, no reason to spend your time here, buy something else, or even if you can't afford something else, I'm sure you'll easily find a better way to spend your time."

,Recommended,414290,22465661,"Posted: 16 April, 2016",all,blokkemblokkem,"The game is super fun and reminscient of Rogue Legacy in the satisfaction department when it comes to opening chests, getting relics (Hero Siege-style, which can be annoying at first because you don't always know what they do), and doesn't make you feel like you need to save expendable items like the bombs and keys.  The combat leaves a lot to be desired, it's just simply too easy.  Nothing poses a challenge to a player who knows NES-era dodge tactics (...move left and right).  Even the last boss is so incredibly easy that I sat there expecting a ""this isn't even my final form"" type of encounter.But, I still recommend the game because it does have some replay value and for $5, that can't be beat.  If you're decent at games, expect about 2 hours to beat it the first time with less than 1 hr required for subsequent completions.  The achievements add some incentive to keep playing for a few run throughs, but you'll be burnt out if you try to complete it consecutively with each class in an effort to 100% the game.If expanded upon with some content that adds more depth via levels, monsters, and bosses could really shine."

,Recommended,414290,23512491,"Posted: 11 June, 2016",all,ronarscorruption,"Princess Loot Pixel Again is a very simple game - but that doesn't mean it isn't fun.At it's core, it's a simple action/platformer game where the dungeon changes and your character resets every time you die, which is often enough. Still, you lose so little, and the game is so short (maybe 20 minutes from start to a successful end), it doesn't feel like you lose much.One problem I have is that it feels like any playthrough is determined directly by the special items I find in the first few levels. Sure, there's still skill involved and you could beat the game with none - but when your game starts with four special powers the play is so much visibly easier than otherwise that it's almost not worth continuing if your first few levels don't have anything.All in all, I liked it. I'm working on beating it with the last few characters, and it was totally worth the price."

You rescue and then have to hit ""ESC"" on your keyboard to return to the title menu, no special victory screen no featuers that would make you want to run it again.I was really hoping the ""Again"" in the title would be key to my feelings towards the end of the game.  Maybe after they get out of beta.I paid $2.74 for this on sale and I wouldn't even recommend that price at this stage.  Pretty much buy this only if you want to support the developers.for what it's worth though I believe it holds potential so maybe when they finish I can change my review**update**Well it looks like the final version of the game is released and the only added feature from the beta, after you beat the game you are now left at a black screen ""again?"" as opposed to before where the game flat out tells you to hit escape to restart.... personally I found the ""hit escape"" more useful than ""again?"""
76561198015233287,Not Recommended,414290,19973891,"Posted: 26 December, 2015",all,Mangu,"For the players: This is an honest review after spending some time checking out this game. This game is perfect if you have a child with around 3-4 years of age because this will mostly challenge him and not frustrate him as much. So far the gameplay is pretty simple, along with a nice catchy chiptune background music. But if you're looking for a challenge or neat mechanics or ANYTHING fresh and new, there are none... there's nothing much to offer except a great price for this game, which reminds me of the golden era of MS-DOS and NES gaming, mostly MS-DOS.For the devs: Considering this is early acces, the game is quite simple so far, somewhat entertaining but extremely easy... if that's your dev team goal, keep it that way, if not... you need to increase the difficulty past floor 1, because... seriously... you don't give much of a challenge, everything seems TOO fair on the player.The game needs more sound effects, I know it's early access but... a sword swing sound, a jump sound and a body land sound wouldn't hurt you know? Also the animations are too stiff and rusty, retro things are memorable and nostalgic but... try to remember why we got past that era... like, add ladder climb animations, a jump animation and most importantly a hit knockback animation, to feel like you're getting beaten. You got a decent project in your hands, try to polish it the most, but as it is in its current state I can't recommend it, but I won't refund it because I got it on sale and I'd like to have a kid someday and probably show him this game to get him started on gaming. If my child enjoys something like this out of ignorance, when the good stuff comes, IT'LL LOOK BETTER! Like he plays this then he meets Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past UMFFF...

Is a 16-bit dungeon crawler full of randomizing rooms, Traps, enemies, bosses, an tons of items.The item system used is a ""Grab-n-Go"" style where you find a power up and decide to take it or leave it. The enemies randomize just like the rooms, and the maps often times consist of 20 or so rooms. It always keeps me on my toes because its so EASY TO LOSE! The second you go ""hey a potion!"" you have a boulder crush you or an enemy hits you. Stay awake or sleep for good. Overall a fantastically made game.

There are some fall into acid/lava levels but its fine because you have double jump.+Dropped items like bombs, hearts, mana orbs and keys are not thrown at you endlessly, but you can end up with a big disparity of items gained depending on your luck.+The music is really good.+The art style works well with the game.-Characters feel a bit slippery because of high movement speeds that you can get.-The levels although well designed get stale with nothing really changing, just the overall layout floor to floor.-Bosses are a joke and a waste of time, the only difficult boss i encountered playing was the 2nd major boss, but once you know its moves it becomes easy like the rest.-Lack of enemy diversity, there are only a few types of enemies, e.g. Zombie, Bats, Skulls and slugs.-Some Special items are unclear as to what they do, there is no real way of knowing with them unless you get the requirement for them to work. But there are some pretty good ones, like the spike friend and the item that lets you see in the dark (shows whats behind doors).-The equipment system is confusing at first. When you find a new item it is hard to tell if it is actually increasing your stats or is just a +1 attack weapon. This should be cleared up by putting its actual attack value with a + or a - depending on what you have equiped. Shields are confusing to get better ones as well, i had one shield that every other shield encountered would appear worse even when it was at 1% durability.Overall i think its a fun game, but i don't think there is enough to keep me playing it for any period of time. Its a rouge-like/lite in terms of the map and enemies being procedurally generated but it doesn't feel like it changes all that much."
,Not Recommended,414290,31195585,Posted: 17 April,all,The Lemonade Dude,"This game seems like a fun little game on the surface. A platformer rogue-like with cool items, bosses and rooms. It is kind of that, but when you dig past the surface what you find is an unpolished, unbalanced and content-starved game that's not going to get any updates. If you are looking for an intricate rogue-like that you can spend dozens of hours on, you won't find it. But if you're looking to throw a few bucks at a couple hours of fun, then go ahead.It is unpolished, because the presentation is just a bit off. Missing explanations here or there, a weird looking monster or trap, a visual style that could with a little polish become charming. It's not the biggest problem, but it's definitely there.It's unbalanced, because the numbers just don't line up. And it kinda feels like with about an hour in an excel spreadsheet it all could've been fixed. The gold you get is never enough to buy anything significant, you get around 500 gold in a full playthrough and most weapons cost 4-700.  Also some classes are just way better than others. The knight's shield makes the game a cake-walk since you can just block all the damage. All of it. Completed the game on my first run with him.It's content-starved, because after playing through the 9 floors the game has I realised that there is not much more to it. I've seen all the enemy types, all the bosses, all the traps and treasures. There was no point in playing it anymore.So basically if you expect to get lots out of this game look elsewhere."

You can tell that the game is unfinished, but for what is available, it shows a great deal of promise. Definitely a game to give a shot. The developer seems to make a bunch of ""silent updates."" I've gone back a few times to see new rooms and enemies without an official update notice. This isn't a bad thing.UPDATE:On 4/15/16, the developer released this as the ""Full Release."" I'm hoping there are more updates, because the game still feels unfinished.UPDATE:As of 4/17/16, the game is in full release, but seems to have been abandoned in favor of a new project by the developer. The game remains very short, and the third boss is completely unable to attack. If you want a quick addicting game with a bit of replay value, go for it, but don't expect much.

Because the story is, you walk up to the Queen or princess(They didn't specify) & the King gets captured from behind by some demon. Your goal is to climb your way up the floors and survive to save the king. The game has 6 Hero's you can play. Necromancer, Paladin, Mage, Rogue, Archer, and a Knight. Each hero has their own different abilities. Some classes are just plain out terrible. For example, As in the video, when i was playing the Rogue, he took a lot of damage and was fast. But he lacked defence to the point where, if I would have got hit 1 time from the enemy. I would take a tremendous amount of health. Also his range sucked so bad that you had to hug the enemies♥♥♥♥♥to hit the darn thing. Necromance just sucks in general. Knight/archer are by far my favorite. Knights has high defence so you can survive longer and archer has range where you dont have to be near the enemy. Another problem about the game in my opinion is the traps. Once you step on a trap, you have a split second to react. Like Jesus ♥♥♥♥, atleast give us 2 seconds, lol If you are interested in the game. here is a link to my video. The video contains all the hero's. Thank you for your time. I hope this review helped.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrjPz4_BozQ"

It's a great, challenging dungeon crawler.Good points:-Great soundtrack-Good mechanics-Good variety of items and pickups-Nicely challenging bossesBad points:-Messy grammar in various areas of the text (not poking fun if the developers' first language isn't English, but it adds a nice touch to the game to be properly written)-The controls are really awkward (J,K and L to attack, with A, S and D to move (Space to jump, not W))-Pretty short at the momentI can see a lot being added to this game. With the multiple characters unhighlighted I can already see that there's going to be a lot of different fighting styles to choose from (Having achievements set for each of these characters would be fantastic).Really hope this gets fully released soon, I can see it being a ton of fun."

,Not Recommended,414290,33080016,Posted: 1 July,all,malaisling,"Essentially an amateur juvenille attempt to recreate The Binding of Isaac as a medieval fantasy game.As a project that a lone new developer made this would be a sweet little game if it were not for the fact they charge you almost the exact same price for a low quality homage as you would pay for the original game they are copying.The game does virtually nothing new, it is just generic 2D game that massively rips off elements of The Binding of Isaac but with extremely little randomization, lazy map; graphical and animation design, no creative concept design, enemies that do nothing but move back and forth in fixed directions, enemies that do track the player but are extremely awkward and sometimes impossible to avoid, instant kill barely visible traps and of course item pickups that do not tell the player even remotely what the item does or ever will do.Not worth cash. Just because some body puts time and effort into something doesn't make it worth cash. Just another greedy, arrogant newcomer developer that wants to profit off making what is basically the artistic equivalent of highschool doodles."

But if you are looking to play for hours right now, this is not the time to buy it yet.I'm going to give a recommend, since it feels really solid gameplay and the possibility to expand.If you want a game with longer playtime value I recommend sit back and relax with this game on your wishlist, or follow."

Definitely worth dropping a couple of dollars on or picking up when on sale. Totes easy to pick up and play a quick game here an there.Warning: I did spend the last five hours of play time and 25+ playthroughs just trying to get one achievement. (The Party One)"

Then it deserves a reccomendation in my opinion.Current state of game is 6/10 :)(EARLY ACCESS REVIEW! 20 January)Overall great game, good balance...I like the game, but to pay such a price for 5 levels isn't fair :lProsit's a decent roguelike.Reminds me about The binding of Isaac.many lovingly items, hopefully much more will be added when released.Overall good looking simplistic design.ConsThe musicSome might dislike the visual styleToo simple boss battleslack of scaling between dmg and def between hero and monsterstoo short (I know It's early access, but don't buy it right now only 5 levels are published)I really hope that there's still someone working on it, it could be a little 1 time hit :)Early access 3/10"
,Recommended,414290,27550582,"Posted: 25 November, 2016",all,716green,"The Binding of Isaac as a 2d platformer with a little less awesomeness and a lot less gross stuff but that's a pretty good representation of what you're in for. This is one of my go-to time killing games. Sometimes you get overpowered, sometimes you struggle to get by, but it is what it claims to be. Nothing more, nothing less and slightly above my expectations. Overall a very well done product of an extremely oversaturated market.The simplicity or minimalist nature of this game is why I prefer it over caveblazers or any of those other much more overhyped roguelike platformers."

,Recommended,414290,28687255,"Posted: 26 December, 2016",all,Sully,"Hi! I don't want to exceed the character limit, so I'm just going to hop into the recommendations I have for the game. Overall, I've enjoyed it, but I'm going to try and gives some tips in the least amount of words possible1. ReplayabilityThe game is pretty bland after the time I play it. You find the same rooms over and over again. With more rooms, I'd enjoy the game a bit more. Possibly, ""Items?"" falls under the category, but I say it needs a part of its own.2. More bosses/More difficult onesEnough said, I want more bosses. Fighting the same ones over again gets lame.3.  Items?Not enough items, I understand it's early access, but at least add more items for updates. Finding the same items over and over again is kinda boring. At least add synergies or something like that, make each run different and interesting for a while. Enough to make it worth the price4. Resource system needs to be fleshed outRight now, the key system sucks, you find way too many key-holes and not enough keys, I'd put less keyholes, but how you solve this is up to you. I also think the money system is flawed aswell, and this is because by the end of the game, I'll have 600-1200 gold, from not buying ANYTHING. Just a thought, flesh out the resource system before anythingOverall, I'd say to buy the game. I think it has potential, and I hope the creators can see this and take this into consideration, despite it not being a lot. I could write a paragraph elsewhere, let's say an email, but I'm sure the devs already have plans and having me write them an email for things they already want to do, would just be pointless, so, peace!"

There are four levels, with each level consisting of 2 stages, as well as bosses, collectables, and a whole manner of traps. Your objective is to resuce the king or die trying... and you'll be dying more than a couple of times.The catch? You have to do it in one solid playthrough. Enjoy!Pros:+ A decent selection of characters to choose from.+ The difficulty is just about right. Not once had I felt cheated from death.+ Cool music.+ The achievements compensate for it's lack of levels.Cons:- Doesn't take long before things get repetitive. A few more different areas and monsters would have been nice.- Keyboard controls cannot be modified.- Considering there's not much there, £3.99 is pretty expensive.Score: 60/100It's good for the odd spare half an hour."
