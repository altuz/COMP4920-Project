We've got a typical supernatural setting with beautiful graphics (except for one HO scene which looked rather bad and low res) and quite nice voice acting.Unfortunately the game is really short and and the puzzles, while enjoyable, are very easy. I was able to finish it in less than two hours so I'd recommend picking it up only if it's on sale."

Who is behind this?Vampires Legends is based apparently on a true story, though I didn't check the facts. The plot is perhaps basic but well, at least, the bonus chapter is kinda a twist and while Rose, the woman featured in the header, is a minor character, she's still important for the plot. Unfortunately, it lacks of Artifex Mundi's creativity. Indeed, the game is published by them and done by another studio. I found rather annoying your partner, however, I loved how Stefan was everywhere at one moment, I even suspected him as the culprit.But I loved the bonus chapter! It was kinda different from the main story as you were seeing past scenes. It would have been great to have that during the whole game.The gameplay is the standard one: HO scenes, puzzles, items to pick... While the HO scenes are easy, some puzzles made me sweat a lot - but I suspect that I wasn't in the right mood for that (real life reasons interfered). However, while the hint system is classic, I found it very original as it's your partner (or Rose in the bonus chapter)The graphics are good, as I loved that kind of atmosphere (gloomy, tragic and mysterious, a tendency to go to the dark side of the Force if I may say it like that) for HOG. The soundtrack is correct.The game isn't perhaps the game of the year published by Artifex Mundi or hasn't the same quality of any game developed by them, but it's still very enjoyable and one of the best in my opinion about vampires in the HO world that I've played."
,Recommended,414660,19470766,"Posted: 3 December, 2015",all,Cely,"Vampire Legends: The True Story of Kisilova is another HoG by Artifex Mundi. As usual, the story is pretty basic and the atmosphere isn't bad but still I kept wishing for more here. Also, I kept wishing for more of a mystery here than there truly was but that's usually the case when it comes to HoG's.  Some of the puzzles were quite cleverly done and they definitely blend well into the storyline, none of them feel too terribly out of place. Overall, it's not a bad little HoG, but I definitely don't think it stands up to some of the others overall.However, what I really have to applaud is the ""bonus adventure"" which ended up feeling more like a mini point and click open world aventure at times (although short) rather than HoG and was very well done. I always love returning back to the original locations that you see in the base game in the bonus adventures, and this was no different and was done in a very clever way and even opened up a few new locations.  I thought the adventuring in this portion was a lot better and the storytelling was well done.Overall, I'd say it's worth it if it's on sale, only because it's so short and definitely not as beautiful as some of the other offerings out there. Here's my ratings:Storyline: 3/10 - Basic storyline - tis is on a scale of HoG games, not all games in general.Puzzles: 6/10 - Some creative sparks here that I enjoyed.Atmosphere: 5/10 - I truly wish this would have been slightly more scary or moody!Scenery/Graphics/Illustration: 6/10Bonus Adventure: 7/10A few random thoughts for good measure:- Seriously, what is a spud bar?- She clicks sea shells by the sea shore (or river) until the sea shells solved themselves randomly, thank goodness.- That rat getting that thing was a bit far fetched, where can I get rats like that?- Also that is the weirdest towel rack I have ever seen.- The intro screen is fabulous, wish the entire game looked like that!- This is apparantely based on a ""true"" story and a real village:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petar_Blagojevich- Finally, I would totally play a game that was just the string puzzle.

It’s far from breaking ground amongst other Hidden Object games, and veterans of the genre won’t see anything they haven’t seen before. But unless you’ve got some high standards, you’re bound to enjoy this title.The year is 1725, and Europe is still licking its wounds after the Black Death. However, most are wracked with paranoia, fearing that disease is soon to strike again. In the tiny town of Kisilova, just on the border of Serbia, reports claimed that nine people have died within the span of a single week. Their deaths can be compared to no other and, fearing the worst, you are sent with a fellow investigator to Kisilova, determined to root out the source of the mystery. But it isn’t long before you realize that there’s no plague ravaging this place… yet something far worse.The story does a great job of reeling you in with its constant foreboding nature and atmosphere. I was genuinely eager to unravel the story and solve the mystery. There are a handful of characters, but most don’t go beyond their skin-deep personalities. Had the setting and conflict not been as great as it was, the story would’ve fallen face first.The artwork is top notch. Anything from murky swamplands to decrepit castles, all boasting their own shadowy corners and flickering lights. Some backdrops look picturesque, and this game’s soundtrack - which is both simple and very fitting - works heavily in their favor.  The heart and effort put into this artwork is evident, and stands as a major plus in Vampire Legend’s overall quality.Seeing as how this is a Hidden Object game, most would expect a variety of Hidden Object scenarios. Thankfully, there are, and they all look as detailed as you’d expect. They don’t stray outside the box or do anything too original, but they get the job done. There’s also a ton of mini games, and I mean a TON of them. I’m aware that mini games are commonplace in Hidden Object adventures, but Jesus, Vampire Legends goes way overboard. Way too many of these, and they often hinder the story’s pacing. On the other hand, they are skipable (Thank God).Voice acting is… pretty terrible. Some are clearly better than others, but none can be classified as “good.” What dialogue there is gets the point across, but it won’t be winning any rewards. It really is a shame, because some pro voice talent would’ve seriously improved Vampire Legends' presentation.Lastly, despite the story being as gripping as it is, its outcome is very predictable. By the midpoint, anyone with a crumb for a brain should know who the vampire is. The ending is unsatisfying, and the game’s bonus chapter does little to build up a proper conclusion.Had Vampire Legends’ artwork and Hidden Object sections not been of this quality, I really couldn’t recommend it. But, in all honesty, I enjoyed my time with this title, and if you’re looking for a campy, by-the-books HOG, this should quench your desires."

Also, the theme is extremely interesting. The whole game kept me hooked, wondering what was going to happen next - since I hadn't actually checked the original story. I had hard time stopping when I started playing. Maybe you guess the culprit ahead, but it didn't take the enjoyment out of the game with the rest of the plot twists.Art was really nice, a bit dark perhaps, but it suits. It really gives off a spooky feeling, at least for a non-horror fan like myself. It also looked quite realistic, compared some of the games I've played.Now, normally I wouldn't say anything about characters in a HOG, but... What was the point of the other investigator? If he was the helper type of character, it would have been fine, but I never needed his help during the game. I think he held a lantern once, that's all. Anyway, his existence didn't really make any difference.I usually play on casual or custom with these types of games, but this time, I went ""normal"". Some puzzles were really frustrating and I had to check the answers from a walkthrough - since there was no strategy guide. Some of the harder ones I actually managed to defeat on my own, so it didn't frustrate me too much in the end. It depends on your level, so I wouldn't necessarily consider this a minus.While it was a bit difficult on occasions and there was one achievement that was particularly hard to get, I still can recommend this game. It has a fascinating story, quite a lot of puzzles and a bonus chapter. All things considered, it's a good game."

However, why do developers of these games still stick to a 4:3 resolution, than stretch the image on 16:9 screens? Awful. Either have your game automatically display at 4:3 (leaving black bars on the sides) or adopt to the fact that most people these days use a widescreen monitor.As for the game, the main campaign lacked excitement for the following reasons:No achievement for doing this in Expert Mode. Why?Puzzles (HO scenes as well as all mini-games) were too easy.Scenes did not transport a scary atmosphere, something you'd expect from a vampire-based story.The bonus chapter was the most challenging part and had the most tense atmosphere. A big pro, though, is the fact that this game contains a waste variety of mini-game types, so it's never truly boring.A huge downside is the fact that the soundtrack cannot be downloaded. No one is sitting in front of their computer and has the game running only to listen to the soundtrack. Also, having to click on each track individually? Come on. Not user friendly at all and truly a waste of the Collector's Edition's bonus content.On the technical side of things, the game did not have any bugs whatsoever. I recommend buying it at the current discount, it's still a nice pastime with potential for a more inspiring sequel."

The graphics are a bit dated and pixelated on wide screens but nothing too distracting to point of not being able to play it or enjoy it. The voice overs are well done and the story not bad. I also enjoyed that it has some steam achievements thrown in for the price and Steam trading cards.It is a shorter game than most HOG's but I still enjoyed this one as a small pastime pleaser.

A lot of hidden object scenes with very intuitive solutions. The only drawback is the average voice acting as well as the not so easily attainable steam achievements and in my personal opinion - a rather high steam price.

This is one of those games what need a 'meh' button for recommendations.You are a mute, genderless investigat-OH-r from Vienna. You and your partner are ordered to go to Kisilova to investigate the mysterious events going on there, people dying and getting sick. I'm not sure I agree with there being no information about the person you are playing; I suspect that the 'playable character' is supposed to make it easier for people of any age and gender to relate to and that some people are bothered by the main character in most of these games are 20-40-something women. (Though the Steam 'About the Game' does say the character is female). Personally in this game it just lead to me not feeling involved in the character at all.Con rants;The story is pretty obvious and so ended up being not that interesting. It's based on a 'true' story so I guess they couldn't change the ending too much.Most importantly;As a headphone user the sound of wind (or whatever it was) constantly in my left ear, but not in my right MADE ME WANT TO SPORK OUT MY BRAIN WHY WOULD YO DO THAT THROUGHTHEENTIREGAMETHEREISNOBREAK♥♥♥♥YOU. So I played the last half of the game or so with the left headphone away from my ear.The HO scenes graphics could be better,There are also no puzzles that I felt were either original or particularily hard; I even got the one I usually suck at completed in minimal clicks. There's also no achievement for not using hint outside of the puzzles/HO scenes, and even on the hardest mode it refreshes fairly quickly, so feel free to spam that sht.There's also no achievent for playing it in the hardest mode, just don't use hints or skip in puzzles and you should only need one playthrough.The voice acting is really not that good, but in some cases it felt like it was the quality of the recording rather than a bad actor. I also felt the dialogues were strange some times, I don't know if it's som culture clash happening, but the reactions and greeting the characters had and used felt strange some times.I'm not sure why there is a random neckbeard in there, I feel like he's a reference I'm missing, and he felt misplaced, like a random timetraveller or something.The game is also so short that you don't get all the trading cards in one playthrough; which is all this game needs for achievement completion. My playtime is me leaving the gae on overnight just to get the cards. Real playtime was 2-3 hours.The game also suffers from false subtitle syndrom, as many games in thie genre does. Future will tell, but I suspect there will only be one ""Vampire Legends"", so I don't see the point of having a 'series title' with no sequels.Pro:The game should get some credit for trying; they really did their research. There are interviews with locals from the real town of Kisiljova as well as many photos from the town so you can compare the scenes form the real town to the one in game, and you do get the same feel from them. You can also see concept art, listen to the different soundtracks and look at concept art from the game. I almost upvoted the game purely for this. Well done, developers.It's published, but not developed by Artifex Mundi, so I've learned to expect a slightly less good game than he ones they've developed. The game lookes pretty good in graphics and the slight animations there are. Both characters and backgrounds are very well made and look good.TL;DR: Potential and research is there, but the game could be better and just.. more interesting. Better puzzles, or at least some interesting twists on old ones, better graphics in the HO scenes and better quality in the voice acting and remove that godawful staticnoise-wind from my left ear, and it would be a good game. Perhaps something for the next part in the ""Vampire Legends"" series.... lol.Buy on sale if you're a huge fan and want to complete your collection and only have hearing on your right ear."

,Not Recommended,414660,29595103,Posted: 30 January,all,Angahareth,"Although it's a pretty decent hidden object game, I expect more from Artifex games.Pros:- very polished. No issues at all with gameplay, interface is great, nothing that I find super annoying about some HOGs. For me this is a very big pro, and why I tend to like Artifex games.- story is decent. It's about vampires, and that's always fun. Nothing super surprising though.  (this might not be a pro or a con, really)- Art's prettyCons:- VERY simple.  Most puzzles are extremely straightforward and don't require much thinking. Although I like to play these on casual, I found this one too easy- Nothing unique - I've seen all the puzzles in other games.- Feels short. This might be due to the simplicity, because I spent about as much time on it as on other HOGs. However, I think that might be because the bonus adventure is nearly as long as the base game (or the base game is as short as a bonus adventure?)- Railroaded - you're not given many chances to explore and discover stuff hidden around the place. The game often tells you exactly where you need to go next, there's no element of figuring out the mystery.Because of this, I would not recommend it at full price, but it's a decent game to pick up on sale. Fans of the genre might find it too easy, but it might be a good starting point for those just getting into it."

Based on real historical events, the story even features characters based on real people, such as your companion Frombald (although I didn't like how they characterized him). They do a great job of giving logical in-game reasons for tasks. I do think it would have been cool for the player to play the piano though. As for graphics, I am arachnophobic, and those spiders gave me the shivers. Entirely too real looking for me!"

The translation was awful, the voice-acting was DREADFUL, the puzzles were often Moon-Logic levels of obtuse, and the Hidden Object puzzles were marred by the translation problems coupled with the fact that MAKING EVERYTHING THE SAME SHADE OF BEIGE RENDERS THEM VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE AT POINTS. There's also a tendency to throw in tedious puzzles which make no sense in context and really just there to pad the game. Oh, and they had a great opportunity to take things in a different direction but instead went with the cheesiest, most-cliched ending possible. They might as well have named the villain Sir Evil McObvious Von Badguyington. :/ Hard pass on this one. Don't waste your time or money."

I didn't manage to finish a hidden object scene in under a minute until the bonus section.  The mini-games are also more challenging than HOGs I have played.A couple of times it was unclear why I was collecting certain items, but a thorough exploration of the area revealed the intent.  Most of the scenes remain unlocked for the whole game, rather than the usual 3 or 4 scene restriction that designers use to hand-hold players through the story.  It actually recalled to mind the wanderings of old-school adventure games.I see some people commented on the character's accents ... I think this is nit-picking.

Bonus chapter had 2 endings, (i choose one and searched other on youtube to avoid play all again to a cutscene of 5 seconds). Anyway, the liberty to choose your path is interesting.The game worth your weekend if bought on sale. Easy to get 100% as well."

The game overall was simple, but absolute not in a boring way.The bonus chapter was suprisingly more complex that the entire game!I truly recommend it :)"

I mean 10$ is a little steep for a 6 hour game but then again I feel like it does have a degree of replayability. I got my copy on sale however and was not disappointed at all. Game has a unique feel to it and I think they hit the mark with the mildly dark theme they were shooting for in a vampire point and click HOG. It was not unreasonably difficult nor was it ridiculously easy. Did not seem rushed as a game no real bugs or glitches, nor did it seem bloated, they didn't put a lot of unnecessary steps in their puzzles. It overall is a slightly above average quality game for it's length and genre I would say. I'd give it a 6.5 out of 10 go ahead and try it!"
