I blame it more on myslef in that I am older and the crowd playing EVE seems much younger than me. I don't mind the Players who pirate as much as the restt of the players. Having said that I read that this game was EVE light so I gave it a try for $10. I love it. I currently have it set fairly easy so I can learn it. Mining is cool, and with a small ship can be a little complex - in that you might not have enough power to fill your cargo hold and then have to stop mining while your charge rebuilds. Bigger ships have less of a problem. I had no problem killing the local rats in either system I have been in and have been able to buy a frigate to mine and explore in. Have had more fun in this game in 2.5 hours than I had last time I played EVE.  Graphics are ok.  It is a point and click/ menu driven game. My opinion, and to me that is good.  If you like space games like EVE, but would prefer a single player experience - got this game."

It is a fully realeased game but it seems the dev is very intent on working on it in the future and adding more features.  Best way I could describe it is eve offline.  It isn't the most graphic heavy game but that doesn't take anything away from it for me, it still looks good and plays good."
,Recommended,414720,19428748,"Posted: 1 December, 2015",all,BillyR,Cool game. If you like the mining style in EVE online you will probably like this game. It's EVE style mining without the PvP guys showing up and destroying your ship in the belts. It can be slow paced and relaxing or a slug fest depending on what you decide to do.
,Recommended,414720,20776859,"Posted: 26 January, 2016",all,Tevyar,"This game is not EVE Online.  The comparisons are hard not to make given the art direction and user experience of this game, but remember -- EVE Online is a massive undertaking by hundreds of people and tens of thousands of hours of effort, and this game is but a mere hint of a shadow of the things that are in that game.That being said, this is a GREAT game for what it is, and it's reasonably priced even keeping its limited scope in mind.It DOES have the feel of EVE Online in some respects.  The gameplay is very similar to your first few hours of cargo hauling or mining in EVE Online, but there it ends.   EVE gives you the complexity of a rich storyline, faction reputations, a complex and meaningful exploration option, and NPC pirates that make relatively smart decisions on their own - not to mention the multiplayer aspects of EVE that truly make that game great.This game lacks all of those things, but what it does deliver on is rather enjoyable nonetheless.This game would be like never getting past high-sec ferry missions and mining in EVE Online, but if that is what you are after (and sometimes I am) this is perfect.  While the complexity is not high and there are no other players to play with, sometimes that is the perfect thing.  There are no disgusting conversations in global chat.  There is no griefing.  You are free to be as slow and deliberate as you want to be.  The danger from moving into a new system is predictable and scales slowly, and once you clear a sector, you are pretty much completely safe there to mine as much as you like.  You don't have to fear walking away from the keyboard for a few minutes here and there.I played EVE for years.  I'd often sit in 0.0 space, deep within my alliance's territory, and just mine the rocks.  It was soothing.  It was easy.  There was very little danger.  Then someone forgot to pay a bill and things went upside down quickly.  It was fantastic.  It was a worldwide event that affected hundreds of thousands of people, and I will never forget it, but the days when I can just sit back and accomplish things for my alliance while streaming netflix on the other monitor are over for me in EVE and have been for some time.This game gives me the ability to do something very similar.  I do miss the alliance chat and the fact that every once in a while we'd get attacked by other thinking humans to spice things up - which is something that you do not get with Astrox - but this does fill a desire when I want to just relax and pretend to be a space miner.If you are a recovering EVE carebear, or even an old-school EVE player who enjoyed more than just the multiplayer aspects of the game, then I would recommend this game highly.If you are a recovering EVE rifter jockey who loves the thrill of the hunt, this game is not for you, but it's still a great game and it might even be worth checking out - it made me somewhat nostalgic for my early days in EVE."

Visually, it isn't complex; yet pretty.  There ARE some hiccups in-game:  the auto refuel doesn't always work, so check it before getting too far from stations.  You can multi-task while playing this game due to automation features that apply to mining and combat (though wouldn't recommend leaving the screen during combat). IMO there is no reason to work up to dreadnought unless you play multiple tours of duty and jack-up the difficulty.  This little sandbox has a lot of toys to play with--replayability might be OK if I give it a month or two.  I wish the game were longer and more in-depth--so many possibilities the developer could have explored.  Perhaps there will be an Astrox sequel?  The Pew-pew factor is very high with this game."

And you can actually REFINE the ore you mine from asteroids! Top marks to the dev also for making something that runs great on old/low end machines.
,Not Recommended,414720,30434374,Posted: 10 March,all,Merdball,"I'm glad I got this for $3.  It's not worth $10.The economy is so unbalanced and meaningless.  It feels like the dev just wanted to build a completely random economy with no thought to whether it would feel at all real.  There is no sense of supply and demand in any way.  All pricing seems completely arbitrary and rarely feels like any balance was done.The game has several places where you should be making decisions, but there's so often only one right answer that you ignore the other options.  For instance, early on, it's far better to get the interceptor, a $4500 ship, and chase pirates until you collect enough kills to get one of those early kill missions for like $25k or so.  Then get the mining escort ASAP.  From that point, kill jobs are almost NEVER worth it, and that ship will easily last for half of your first run.  Transport jobs have never once been worth it for me.  Not early on, not mid-game, not end-game.  Mining jobs are sometimes a complete joke, paying about 5% more than the ore is worth, which is generally not worth the time to go to the station posting the job.  Other times, they're absurdly over-priced, and these are where you'll (very rarely) get a job that you'll go out of your way to complete.  In cases where the price is really high, I thought perhaps the ore was super rare and far from the sector offering the job.  Then I ran into a job where the ore was incredibly abundant, particularly where the job was offered.  Again, no feel at all of any kind of semi-realistic economy or supply and demand.Beyond those super-lucky jobs, not only are mining jobs worthless, but mining in general becomes a huge waste of time.  You're far better off repeatedly killing pirates.  Either generate a map with respawn on and repeat-kill the commander, or just jump from gate to gate killing the lesser pirates without killing the sector boss.  You never run out of loot, and even if you run out of cargo space, you can just jettison it because you're making a ton more money picking up bounties, cargo with credits, and cargo with valuable modules.In fact, most of the time your cargo is such crap that your best option is to scrap everything at the refinery instead of trying to go in and sell stuff at the market.  It's just too time-consuming with all the garbage ""loot"" you get to go to the market, click ""sell"" and then ""max"" and then ""sell"" for every individual item.   Your cargo bay just fills up with crap and you have no choice but to scrap it as fast as possible.  Except modules, oddly.  You seem to be able to hold as many of the various modules as you could ever want, and they're usually worth a lot more than any of the ores or trade goods you find so often.When you first get a full complement of heavy drones, they're so powerful they may outdo your normal weapons.  But after you upgrade your weapons modules in the lab, drones are so useless they're not worth keeping around.  There is no way to upgrade the usefulness of drones without hundreds of millions of credits at the university, whereas you can max out an artifact battle laser for a small fraction of that cost.NPC interaction is basically rolling the dice to hope for a good lab formula.  There isn't any kind of faction system or mini-missions to fulfill.  There aren't even any interesting pirate-versus-police battles you can run across.  There are merchants who sometimes sell rare parts, but I found that just wasn't worth the time chasing after the randomly-spawning merchants anyway.Skills are a joke.  Very few are worth the money to max out, and some are so expensive for what you get, I can't help but think the dev seriously put them in there as a joke.  +0.1% turn rate for several million?  Even the best jobs I've ever seen, with a custom galaxy and max job payout, was about 200 million.  So I could nab one of those incredibly rare jobs and increase turn rate by a grand total of MAYBE 3%.  On the other end of that spectrum, the fuel skill is actually a waste beyond something like level 70, because once you get fuel burn reduction high enough, you no longer use fuel.  Seriously.  Rush that one and exchange your fuel tank for something useful, because you'll never need it again.With skills being a joke, who cares about leveling up?  I don't.  I'm level 100-something, and I have hundreds of skill points.  It's meaningless.  Not sure why the dev even bothered with that stuff without spending a few hours to see if it added any fun to the game.  (Spoiler alert: it didn't)The galaxy creation ""difficulty %"" is hilarious.  Start generating a galaxy with default options.  30% difficulty, right?  Okay, push systems up to 100.  Difficulty claims to be 40%.  Now bump systems back to 10 and pirate strength up to 6.  Difficulty is 40%.  This is ridiculous.  By system 30, the pirates you face BEFORE the officer's fleet will be far tougher than the final pirates you'll battle in the ten-system game.  By sector 100, you're facing pirates even an end-game player has to be careful with.Most sliders adjust the difficulty in similarly meaningless ways, but sector size is my favorite.There are game-ruining bugs / issues, like when you have death penalty set to ""lose ship"" and you had drones out.  You can never dock the drones because they aren't around anymore.  But you can never dock at a station because the game thinks you didn't dock your drones.  Or if you accidentally generate a galaxy that's way beyond you from sector 0.  You're screwed, too bad.  Start over.  Did the dev even bother to test the game HIMSELF?  Because he obviously didn't have others test it.Then again, maybe he figured it doesn't matter if you have to start over.  Because once you understand which ""choices"" aren't actually meaningful, you can have a nova dreadnought decked out in level-99 top-tier artifact modules in under 10 hours of gameplay.  At which point, of course, there's not much left to do.There are a myriad of annoying UI decisions.  Hotkey support is minimal, so if you're in trouble your best bet is usually to pause the game and then manually click what you need to click.  Piloting the ship yourself is an immensely unsatisfying experience.  Trying to plot a jump to sector 10 in a large galaxy can be almost impossible, as hotspots on the galaxy map seem to take precedence over the dropdown button which appears to be in front of said hotspots.  You click ""Set as Warp Destination"" just to open a different sector's dropdown on accident.  You can't hold onto your ""auto-target"" setting when you jump through a wormhole.  Which means you have to click the ""List Pirates"" button followed by ""Auto Target"" every time you jump to a new sector.  If you decided to go for a 100-sector map, this dance gets REAL old.I can't even go into details on all the grammar and spelling errors.  A good writer can get away with a few errors here and there, because you've been immersed in a deep, entertaining sci-fi story.  This game's writing just makes me feel like I'm grading a 12-year-old's half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Creative Writing project.For $3, this is fun to just tinker with settings and stuff, but it is not a complete, polished, or balanced game.  Even at $3 it's disappointing as I was hoping for something like a mini-Rebel Galaxy.  There are very few meaningful decisions for a player to make.  It's not deeply strategic, it's not exciting, and it's not even a little bit immersive.  If you get it for free, sure, give it a few hours.  If it's a few bucks and you really love the genre, it might be worth the money to you.  If it's full price, you'll regret your purchase unless you just really want to support not-even-mediocre indie game development."
,Not Recommended,414720,23454091,"Posted: 8 June, 2016",all,mattia23r,"I followed the good reviews stating this is a ""mini EVE"", without the hassle of the monthly fee (which isn't the best for a casual player), the over-demanding community and the overwhelming gameplay. Eventually, it took just a few hours of play to run out of thrill.I was surely looking for a simpler gameplay, but this istoosimple. You just mine (for convenience almost always the same ore), refine for credits, kill (automatically) a handful of pirates, move to the next system, rinse and repeat. It is more of an arcade than an open world game. What disappointed me the most is that there is no reason to establish yourself on a station and run your errands from your ""base"", where you keep your stuff, your ships and everything. I can't carry anything with me, because every station you move in asks a hefty fine for warehouse space. Yet I can't leave anything behind, since I can't travel back and forth tens of systems (I played a 100 systems game) everytime I need a stack of material. I can't even have different ships to perform different tasks (fight, mine, and trade), because I can't settle anywhere and there's no way to carry my ships with me, unless I sell them all in a system and buy them again in the following one.Basically you choose one type of ship and use it for everything, until you need/can afford a better one and switch it, leaving out all the fun of owning and using different kind of ships.A solution to this could be having something like an EVE-like warp engine that in a short time lets you reach any visited system without stops, so that you can ""go home"" quickly.About the economy: apart some very profitable missions, there is no point in trying to earn money with trade. Mining is the only real option. Extracting trading materials from ores yields much, much less money. Also, buy and sell prices of those materials are the same: it's unusual and allows to have a ""virtual warehouse"", where you sell your looted stuff and buy it back when needed at roughly the same price. Not sure if working as intended or just a sort of exploit.It could be nice if there was a ""refining skill"" system that when leveled up allows to earn more from refined materials than just selling raw ore.As a side note: please... remove those ""suns"": let alone that they're way too small (the size of a station), there's no sense at all for them to be there (I wonder if they're stars at all) since every ""system"" is just the surroundings of a planet, not a solar system. Plus, they look like lit off until you have them in your sight, then they begin burning.. really odd.However I want to acknowledge the efforts of the developer, since no one can demand much from a single person and this is an ambitious project nevertheless.Anything I misunderstood, I'd be happy to learn better."

Replay value is high as each galaxy you start you can customize with extreme levels. The enjoyment I got out of being able to both just casually play around and crush enemies in one play through as well as gritting my teeth as I continuously get my butt handed to me on a silver platter in another.... Very few games have I experienced that and still enjoyed every minute. Boasting of its ability to play on any clunker is probably no joke since the graphics are definitely a couple gens old, heck even the download is micro compared to most space sim/rpgs on the market. I've had combat that ranges from just letting auto pilot take full control to my having to really micro manage what the ship is doing to keep from getting obliterated.Pros:Fun, addictive levels of fun.Gamplay varies according to player's preferences.Play on any computer, I think literally.Very affordable.Cons:Its small size becomes more apparent with its lack in depth beyond a miner/combat ship sim.100% single player, no tag teaming through space with your buddy or trying to take eachother out in a blaze of glory.So overall, I've enjoyed every minute with this game, and I will definitely play it again later. I wish it had more to it like a form of factions and relations, as well as a more viable trading system, perhaps even the ability to setup your own stations... Either way for the price, size, and customization available, you get a very happy customer."

The game is not very punishing as there seems to be no death penalty, allowing you to continue from the last station you were at before dying. Some might not enjoy that, but personally I hate losing progress in games.So in summary, I could describe Astrox as being ""Eve Offline Singleplayer Lite"". Of course I wish it could be more, but what's in the game is still worthy to recommend."

It's not the sexy feature rich game on the scale of EVE, and the comparisons to EVE can't be avoided, because it plays a lot like it.  But its damn fun for what it is.You create your name, pick an avatar portrait, configure very modular difficulty/galaxy properties, press play.  The galaxy is randomly generated.  There is a short simple surprisingly useful tutorial that is skippable, and you're on your way.  You mine asteroids, kill pirates, run missions, upgrade your ship and components along way.  You're a prisoner in a section of space essentially slaving to make money for the Corporate Government that put you there.  It's  a lawless zone with rules.They way you move from one sector to the next farming, killing, looting, questing each sector with harder pirates to kill, cheif among them being an officer pirate, or even a pirate base.  It feels also like a dungeon crawl in some ways.  Which inevitably makes it feel repetative, but that's where all games end up eventually.But, more features are coming, and I expect this labor of love will see continued development.  I think the Dev understands what makes games like this fun.  I've already got more than my $10 worth at 22 hours, and I'm nowhere near bored with it.  The only problem I see in its future is that unlike EVE with the MMO player presence, a single player game requires believable AI, and meaningful interaction with it, as well as a very well paced and balanced progression.  He doesn't have everything quite fleshed out yet, like the leveling and skill point system seems a bit clumsy.  A lot of missions early on aren't worth the time, unless you up the mission rewards in the diff settings, but that makes the good missions way too rewarding.  Fuel system needs more thought IMHO.  Just little things that don't break the game at all, they just need some balance here, some polish there....Bottom line. I hope people buy this game.  I'm glad I did."

I'll start by confessing that I haven't played EVE (I was interested, but figured I was too late to the party), and I haven't played this game very long (it was unbearable). That being said, I'd hardly call this a game; games are supposed to involve at least some element of fun!So far this has been my introduction to the game:1. Here is your ship, and here is a space station. To go to the space station, click on it and sit waiting while your ship travels there on autopilot. (Alternatively, you can turn autopilot off and just hold the 'forward' button)2. Now that you're on the space station you can buy a few upgrades to your ship: basically weapons, a bigger cargo hold, fuel, and tools to help you mine. Not as good as it sounds.3. Ready to start earning? Go mine an asteroid, (i.e. click on it and wait for your ship to travel there on auto-pilot, or hold 'forward' for two minutes).4. Now you're at the asteroid, click to mine it. And watch and wait... for about a minute or so while your ship shows a basic mining graphic. (Such fun!)5. Done. Now click back on the space station, and wait a couple more minutes for your ship to get there, etc.6. Next we're gonna fight some space pirates! See those red dots? Click on one of them. Now you'll have to wait about five minutes for your ship to get there. Then your ship will automatically engage and kill those dots. Wow, that was great wasn't it. Now it'll take you another five minutes to return to the space stat...zzz7. 10 minutes later... more pirates and an officer this time. Now watch while your cruddy ship pew-pews those red dots. (Again, you can turn off autopilot, but what's the point?)8. Done. Now you get to watch for another five minutes while your ship slooooowly travels back to the space station.9.

Considering I got it on Steam sale for less than what a Starbucks cappuccino costs, while enjoying it for 100x longer (i.e. 10 hours), I consider it to be among the best money I've spent this month.The only remotely negative thing I can say about is that it lacks depth.  Sure, you can regenerate your galaxy after you win the stock campaign, with all types of sliders and such.  But you'll be faced with the same limited set of weapon upgrades and a basic set of mission types: ""kill"", ""transport"" or ""mine"".  As such, I called it quits after my first playthrough.The developer is already planning on building his best ideas into a full-blown sequel, which is great to hear.  I eagerly await that game and may very well make it a launch-day purchase, given the strength of its predecessor."

First... whatever you read in a review, don't believe it.  I'm a sucker for procedurally generated games, most especially when the game gives a high degree of control over the procedure. That's exactly what this game is.The downside of this is that you can pretty easily create a no win game. A game where the badguys are tougher than you, more numerous, re spawn immediately, and  block all the gates meaning you'll never grow to take them. Of course, you set up the scenario, so you only have yourself to blame. It can be not be this way just as easily.The upside...oh the upside... is that the game can be very different. You can start in a junky ship carefully avoiding enemies, picking them off one by one, or create a game where you start in a big bad ship dealing with spawns and spawns and spawns of low level enemies....or...fewer more competent enemies who stay dead.

I've played this game since it was originally on Kongregate, and even then I greatly enjoyed it, but it isn't without it's flaws.Heres a list of the pros and cons I gathered:Pros1. Ease of access - it really doesn't take much to get to the bulk of gameplay2. Customization - you can establish how much you want to play before you even start (i.e. number of systems, rarity of asteroids, strength and number of enemy units, ect.)3. Fair ammount of content - outside of combat, you can mine asteroids, recover lost cargo, trade between stations and merchants, do odd jobs, and upgrade your ship quite a bit4. Good soundtrack - Dispite only having five songs that loop in this game (at least at the time of me writing this review) They fit the feel of the gameMy only real con is the graphics - before I get to this, I want to point out that this game looks good for all intents and purposes, but as far as entities go (Ships, space stations, asteroids) they look alright, but feel a little lackluster. My main complaint is more about color choices though. I like the design of the entities, but essentially the player ship an space stations will always be grey, pirates will always be red, and friendly ships will be a bluish green. While these are good identifiers, they feel sterile to me. Some color customization for the ships, or even custom paint jobs and decals would add more in my opinion.All in all, I feel this is a good game to paly. It can be relaxing when you want it to be, exciting in tough combat, and full of upgrades (which is a plus for me). If this review has been helpful, I reccomend giving this game a shot."

It has some superficial similarities in terms of space stations, mining asteroids and fighting space marauders, but there is no real concept of an economy, there is no production of equipment, or ships or stations, and the combat is almost completed automated. The design of Astrox has clearly been influence by Eve Online but its gameplay is hugely thinner and qualitatively different.So if you are looking for Eve Online without the Player-killing, Astrox isn't it. Indeed, even though people have been playing Eve for years, the longevity of Astrox is more likely measured in terms of days since there is very little variation in its gameplay. And, of course, you are playing it alone.In a nutshell, you mine asteroids to make money, with which you buy stronger ships to defeat stronger guardians at stargates. To be fair, the loadout for your ship can have significant impact on the outcome of such battles, and there is some gameplay choices in terms of a choosing speed over turtling armor and the like, but the variations are few and soon explored. There is also significant variation in terms of the parameters under which the game is played. Things like asteroid size, marauder strength, size of the galaxy, etc, but while these choices will affect the difficulty of the playing the game they will not affect the gameplay. There is also a nod to player skill progression but the impact of such skills on gameplay is modest while the cost to buy such skills is relatively high in terms of your income.In sum, Astrox is a casual and low-stress space mining game spiced up with some combat. You will likely completely explore its gameplay after a few run-throughs, but you can challenge yourself by adjusting its difficulty."

Really automated!!5) It's perfect to watch a movie or browse the web and play in a window.6) Not a twitch style game at all. So if you want some crazy fast paced space shooter, this really isn't that kind of game. It's more like a very cool Space Solitaire.If you like EVE for the carebear side of the game with upgrading and trying out new ships, you will really enjoy this very inexpensive game. It's not as deep as EVE, but it's still fun and I think the dev is on the right track.WARNING: Don't make the game too easy with the custom levels. It's best to make it a bit harder since it's only about 100 sector maps to play through. You're game play through will be more enjoyable and it will hold a value longer.I really don't have any negatives since it's a low cost fun PVE game with decent graphics (not great, but passing).+1 for the DEV...This is one of those, support the developer and get something back - type of situations . This game won't bring you thousands of hours of game play at this stage, but the 50 hours you will play, will be a fun time and it will be clear you're helping get a good programmer started in the industry."

Click on a thing, wait, click on the next thing - or use the autotarget and skip even the clicking. Even after upgrading from junkheap to a Corvette (which required minimal effort, had no challenge, and just took time), there was no real interesting decision making to be had. Mine stuff, or click on a badguy and wait. Combat doesn't seem to be interactive, and there seems to be no benefit to manually controlling combat.The space map was fully 3D, which is interesting, but hard to use without the automated lists. Tried manual controls, and it was frustrating.There are clearly additional systems to be engaged with, such as crafting, but after a few hours, I needed more engagement and less click-and-do, so not getting to them. Given the base mining/combat gameplay, I don't think they could add much depth to the basic experience.For a first-swing indie game, it's a great start, and I wish the developer luck.

I thought they could have done a better job at designing better looking ships and actually see the weapons and engines ecspecially when you did upgrades,  This game was fun to play, but could have been a fantastic game if they would have added some more detail in the ships and perhaps threw in a few alien races that you had to either errdicate or form an alliance with to spicen it up.

If you want to mine, select asteroids and turn on mining lasers and walk away for a while. Combat is similar, except do it with regular lasers instead. If your numbers are big enough, you'll have either a full cargo hold or a bunch of dead enemies when you come back. If your numbers aren't big enough... I dunno, I assume you die, it never happened to me. I could've upped the difficulty and played a new game, but I am not sure why you would want to.

The reason I purchased this game was because I've sunk dozens if not hundereds of hours into that old version, and I wanted to support the developer further.Essentially this is a space mining/fighting/trading game set in the distant future. The levels, challenges, enemies, trade stations, economy, etc., etc. are all up to you; you can completely customize your experience. Any ship can be completely automated via autopilot, and also can be manually controlled. So if you want a more laid back experience, you can kick on autopilot and it'll do the work for you, or if you want to have full control of your movement you can do that, too.Gameplay wise I have to give this game a 5/10. There really isn't a lot there. Fighting is identicle to mining and trading with autopilot on, making the actual acts themselves repetitive. However, that is not the selling point of this game. The selling point is what goes on during those events. Things like money management, energy allocation, part stats, etc. are where this game really shines and gets a 10/10. The progression in this game gets a solid 8/10. There is A LOT to upgrade and a lot of different paths you can take when chosing how you want to modify your ship(s). The best part is that these paths are not pre-defined for you, so you have to get into the in-game ""world"" in order to find out what the best choices are for your playstyle. This is probably why the game is so addicting. Once you realise how in depth the progression is, you get sucked in with all the goals you set for yourself. So, the addictiveness gets a 9/10. I've never been so engrossed with a game before.Overall, the game gets an 8/10 from me. The point of this game isn't the act of mining, or the asthetics, but the progression and complexity of doing something as simple as deciding what energy upgrade to get. The game is very casual and laid back, so if you're looking for a shooter game or hardcore pvp game, this isn't for you. The game is still being updated after more than a year of development, so I don't expect the developers to abandon this game any time soon."

Mining and fighitng are no different really. The only thing different is when fighting they shoot back.Landing/Docking When you land or dock it is nothing more than a fade out/fade in and then you are in the docking bay. Same thing every time. Kinda gets boring after a while.Pros: When you get board of manually controlling your ship or doing the same things over and over again you can auto pilot most things with the click of the button. What I liked the most about this was that when you advance into the game you have the ability to forget about some of the simpilar things and automate them.Graphics: The backdrops and details of the game are pretty well done and I appreciate the apparent time that was taken in making it a lovely game to look at."

Combat does not have an arcade feel at all, mostly you just turn your guns on and click a new target each time your current one explodes.

There are some skills to learn and improve, component upgrades to figure out, and rare looted components, but not close to the depth of JtL's looting and reverse engineering. Graphics are simple but well done and controls are well-thought out.In its current state, Astrox is probably the type of game I'll play occasionally when I have a couple hours to spare and don't want to get stressed out. After just 11 hours, it feels like I've seen the majority of the game already and that additional advancement will require a lot of grinding, but it's enjoyable and the price is right."

Especially the deep upgrade and item system and the hard fight against higher leveled enemies make this game quite interesting. Fighting seems to be boring at the beginning, but can become absolutely deadly in mid- and later game, unless the player configured the game to easy or with too few systems. When the reznors and bigger enemies come, things become much more interesting.The controls with lot of automation options make fighting and ship management easy. Flying feels quite good and lot of easy useable camera options offer lot of possibilities. Weapon fire and hit in the center of ships and objects. Collisions are not happening. This gives a high performance boost and is actually not a big problem. Graphics are pretty decent and have a own unique style and the music gives a good atmosphere.The game is not the best, but it is quite good and has a long history of continously developement and growth. The developer cares about the player and does lot of work. I have played this game since the beginning on another platform in the beginning of 2014. I have played it for aprox. 100 hours before i bought it on steam. I played lot of games of this genre and can say, this is a quite unique experience, which is actually worth the few bucks.Things, which can be improved or added:-active startable Missions with triggered events (examples: fly out and kill group of things; fly stuff to XY and don't die; fly stuff to XY without getting any hit; collect 10 boxes; shoot and destroy blue asteroid before it hits station)-More cool speeches from pirate leaders-Big boss fights (hard strong pirate ships with long range or high speed or other special attributes... rare pirate, epic pirate, unique pirate)"

This is the review for you!I picked this up from the Summer Sale for $5 but would have no problem paying the $10 I see it for right now.  This was one of my gamble purchases as the reviews made me hesitate but now it might be my favorite of the bunch!The biggest point I would ask you to consider is how much story matters to you.  If you require a narrative to keep you interested then look elsewhere.  But if you enjoy freedom and have fun creating your own story then take a chance on Astrox.  There's no voice acting which to me is more immersive as I remember Skyrim characters were funny....at first.  Ironically this game reminds me of Skyrim just without the dramatic storyline but enough to do to keep your coffers filled and ship pointed in any number of directions.  Also this lack of voice acting leaves your imagination to fill in with characters from whichever of the many Sci-Fi series you are a fan of.To continue with the Skyrim parallels: your ship's weapons and armor are customizable and upgradable, there's skills for your character to learn and expand upon in Universities, and Labs for crafting that you'll actually be searching for recipes to unlock new upgrades for specific ship parts!Everything from the maps to the difficulty levels are highly customizable.The game is beautiful!  It makes me occasionally just turn off the autopilot feature and enjoy free roaming through space.The only real cons I could think to list would be the very generic almost seemingly unfinished character profile creation.  I really enjoy a good character generator but I'm fine with focusing on my ship in this game.  The UI has a few small quirks like adjusting the size of the game's text can overlap certain numbers but it's nothing unbearable.    The very basic main menu is actually kind of refreshing actually bc it takes merely seconds from bootup to being in space!This is an early review at only 5.6 hours played but I just wanted to share with some gamers who don't have the Eve experience to compare to.  I would say that if you enjoy the mining process or bandit hunting processes in games like Skyrim or Runescape but want that in space, this is your game!8/10"

I read the discription and it looks interesting. I read the reviews and they seem good. However many games have started out this way, the thing that really has captured my interst is the obvious care and support of the developer. I've been a gamer for over 40 years (anyone remember when modding was putting a piece of cardboard inbetween the cartrage and slot on the 2600?) and I've always liked to support the small developer who truly does it for the love of the game. So consider this a sale made, even if i don't fall in love with the game your commitment to your creation deserves my money!Update: After playing for a few hours, have to say its a fun simple game that has lots of potential. I enjoyed the quick gameplay that allowed me to upgrade my ship quickly and the controls are well thought out. Manual control of the ship is a little touchy and combat is a little to simple. You can literally just target and destroy the lower level pirates at will. I played through 5 sectors and the rate at which I could upgrade was faster than the rate the pirates upgraded. I wonder if this is a balance issue or will be solved by adjusting the gameplay options. I suspect that there is more depth to this game than just a few hours can show. My overall view is that its a good buy at $10 and a STEAL at the current $4 price. Thanks for a groovy little space game!"

You also need to keep an eye open for some items that can be used to upgrade your installed equipment.Destroying enemy ships sometimes results in them dropping items of equipment, which are usually better than the equivalent item you can buy.If you enjoy exporation, mining, and just fooling around with endless configurations for your ship, you will like this game. If you are more into fighting, probably less so, as the AI is not really a challenge for a well set-up vessel.Having complete one tour, I found the options menu. This allows many changes which will greatly increase the combat options. If battle is what you are looking for, you can set the AI to really ridiculously hard levels, and blast away.

Each ship (as Eve online) have their personal bonuses which gives you a hint of what the ship was made for.Now, you can mine (which is basicly what you should do to get money), kill the pirates that are in each system (they dont respawn quickly unless you alter that in the settings when starting the game) and trade. That's pretty much it. And despite the 'lack' of things to do, the mining part of the game is the most relaxing thing i've done in awhile (23 hours after all).Now, what I would want for this game: Expand the ship list, alter the appearance of the ships that exist (They all look so similar that I forget what the hell im piloting) and expand nummer of systems that can be made (more then a hundred would be nice).

The ""inmate"" background makes no sense considering this is a capitalist/tycoon game. The tutorial is basically the entire story.Little to no replay value.Some of the sectors have intense red sections which can give you a headache.Manual control of ship is almost impossible as without autopilot the ship will not maneuver in any reasonable fashion. So there goes my little fantasy of being a freestyle pilot.Autopilot will not navigate around asteroids and instead run into them repeatedly.Pirates are little more than a nuisance.No pause game, so if you take a pee break there is a chance you'll die.Honestly it just fell short in my opinion.

And that's not necessarily a bad thing. And I'm serious. I really do see a market for kids here.But as an adult looking for a nice immersive, even atmospheric, experience with some strategy and a chance at excitement for a while... I don't get it. A lot of people have compared Astrox to EVE. Well, if this is EVE minus the MM part, then I won't even bother looking at EVE. I tried to like Astrox. I really did. The reviews looked like it would be one I'd like.But after a few goes, I got real bored... and sorry I spent money on it. It became the same thing over ... and over ... again. You go to a new system. You kill the bad guys. Mine some prophet. Sell it. Update your ship. On to the next location. Wash, rinse, repeat... only this time the bad guys are a bit stronger.There's no depth. Only this mining for prophet so you can be the meanest badest ombre in the universe. And no one really cares if you are. There are a few things thrown in for depth, like customized weapons and such. It's just not enough.There are some really cool elements too, like, if you have enough fuel and are strong enough you can fly, instead of warp, from one system to another. That's pretty cool. But, so what? There are other games out there that offer that kind of thing and more. If you want more depth in this kind of genre, minus the MM, you'll do much better with X3AP or Evochron Legacy.This isn't even worth the disk space required to run it... IMHO... that is unless you're a kid. Seriously. As much as I am dissapointed, I would buy it for a kid as I really do think he or she might enjoy it if they were real gamers."

But it's very relaxing and there's definitely something enjoyable in going through the motions of upgrading your starship from a tiny useless piece of junk hauling $900 of minerals at a time to piloting assault destroyers and dreadnoughts that cost $15,000,000.As a lot of people have said It's EVE offline lite. If you want to just relax and trade, mine or fight relatively easy pirates while not paying too much attention it hits that sweet spot. And I'd especially recommend it if you appreciate games made by a single person, since it's not particularly impressive mechanically or visually.Pro's:- Easy/quick to learn- Very chill- Progressing/Upgrading is very fulfilling- Cheap ($2.99 on regular sales)Con's:- Slow/Boring- Visually averageI imagine most people will get 5-10 hours of enjoyment out of this, if you pick it up for a few bucks thats a pretty good time/dollar spent ratio.Overall 6.5/10"

Just a word to the wise to buyers take some time playing with the difficulty settings to reach around 50% because if you just jump in like I did and hit play you will be disappointed as the game will be ultra easy I went half way through the universe (10 systems) in no time without challenge or coming close to dieing after some tweaking it is great fun.**Edit 5/13/17** -- With no updates in 8-9 months I would say stay away from this. It appears to be another dead or at least very long in production titles. I will keep an eye on it and update my review again if things change.

Once you learn how to mine asteroids, and avoid or fight local pirate patrols, you've pretty much accomplished all there is to the game. From that point forward, it's just about getting better gear, and warping to each new level. I say this because there is no actual story. It's just here's your ship, here's your tools, good luck. Still, it can be fun if you like to grind, and the navigation system is pretty novel."

For what it is, this is a pretty fun game. Be warned, the similarities to EVE are very few and far between and the game does get very repetitive after 5 systems or so but definitely worth a try, if on sale."

,Recommended,414720,35432410,Posted: 2 October,all,DrSquick,"Great game if you like tiering up from very low-end space ships with one or two weapons to mega dreadnoughts with seven weapons and a ton of utility systems.  One very unique part of Astrox is the default controls are that you click an astroid, station, or pirate in the list on the right and autopilot takes you there.  One step further is enabling Auto Targetting, which will target the next of those on the list after the first is mined or dead.I really fell in love with this game after the first play through.  The first universe is very easy, and the quest is just a ~8hr tutorial.  Once you beat the game once you are presented with an option to recreate the universe with custom parameters.  Kick up the difficulty, allow pirates to respawn, and bring your old ship back to do it again!Not for everyone, but this is definitely a great game!"
