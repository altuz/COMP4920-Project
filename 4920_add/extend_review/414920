,Recommended,414920,22782631,"Posted: 3 May, 2016",all,LadyOberon [#GamersRule],"I've spent several hours playing Corgi Warlock, and overall, I have to say that I'm impressed with the game. It's a side-scrolling action platformer with monsters to kill, loot to collect, and upgrades to attain.The graphics and soundtrack are good, and the controller mechanics are both consistent and responsive. I enjoy gaming with a controller, and nothing disappoints me more than a game that advertises full controller support but doesn't deliver. Corgi Warlock delivers.There are 10 levels to the game, and so far, I've made it to level 7. What I thought at first was a casual gaming experience is actually really quite challenging. The layout of the levels isn't where the challenge comes in, it's the progression of monsters with varying degrees of health coming across the screen at a steadily increasing pace.The additon of obstacles such as platforms over water, jumping sharks, and fireballs flying across the screen add unpredictability and the need for quick response time to the mix. As the levels progress, response time gets shorter and shorter while the difficulty increases, meaning that even the most hardcore gamers will find a challenge during the latter portions of the game.I did experience a few oddities that I want to point out. The first is that killing a coin-dropping monster with a tower in the background results in coins getting stuck in mid-air on the screen. This can be re-created most easily in level 6 or any level where there are step-like platforms leading up to a higher level. The bottom level ends at a gray tower, meaning that you can't advance any further to the right. However, the monsters are coming from the right side of the screen, as well as the left, so if you stand right at the end of the bottom level and shoot, or jump up on a right-side platform and shoot, coins will regularly drop and fly up into the tower, getting stuck on the screen where your character cannot go.This brings me to the second oddity, which is that the Steam Overlay doesn't seem to work with this game, and neither does the F12 button for taking screenshots. I wanted to take a screenshot of these trapped coins to publish, but I couldn't figure out how to do this. Neither F12 or the Print Screen button worked for me, and I was unable to use Alt-Tab and snip tool to clip a JPG. Anyone determined to get a screenshot would likely have to clip a frame out of a video streaming session.Other than those couple of things, which really didn't reduce my enjoyment of the game, overall, I didn't experience anything that would cause me not to recommend the game. It's appropriate for young and casual gamers as well as experienced gamers looking for a challenge."

But it seems to be missing a lot of those little things that make a videogame whole.  Fireballs just kindof appear out of the end of a tiny spear, for example.  When you pick up coins they just disappear instantly rather than some kind of sparkle.  THings like that.  But I could overlook those things if the gameplay wasn't so basic.  Maybe it's more fun on co-op but I didn't really enjoy it."

It takes about 3-4 hours to beat and each and every minute of them is fun. There is a very high number of different enemies, a bunch of bosses with some nice mechanics and weak points. The difficulty increases as you progress through the game but it never gets too difficult to become frustrating.And it's ONLY 3 euros at full price, which goes down to -80% (0.60) on sales. To maximize the fun, you should play with a controller and up to 3 friends, but I played it alone on a keyboard and still loved it. :)"

The game stays fresh with the introduction of new monsters constantly and it doesn't get stale.  The cooldowns are very fair, but I'd probably increase the heal cooldown a little more.  I need to try out the battle mode still, alas I need friends first.Overall cute game and fun to play.  8/10, great job!P.S. I HATE THOSE BATS!  =P"

That said it is a very casual game with a low difficulty curve. I had fun and laughed at the humor that it had and tried to not take it too seriously. I did not get to test the multiplayer function of this game however.Bottom line is I would say this is a good game to have a evening messing around and not wanting to get too stressed.I did play this on my YouTube channel if you want a play though of it go to my*Playlist*of it.

Basically if you are thinking of buying this game, let me describe what you are buying.It feels like one of the mini games you played for hours for some extra money in the arcade section of the browser based MMO, (Toon town or Wizard101), you played as a kid. Its simple and addicting. The only downside is that it is only Split Screen Co-op, if online was added, this would be an amazing game to play with friends you cant get together.Simply put, If you have extra cash, buy this game."

,Recommended,414920,19972373,"Posted: 26 December, 2015",all,Edgewalker,"Corgi Warlock is a basic platformer with local multiplayer support. It is an amateur attempt, but one with its own charm. It's also fairly easy, so it should be suitable for kids. I picked up the game for US $3.49 (about €3 or £2.3) which is about as much as I'd suggest paying, though if you have a few kids that want to play together, it's worth the normal price of $7.GoodStraightforward platformer design - nothing tricky or hard to learn. Good if you're looking for casual, or if you're young and new to the genre.Has a ""cuteness"" factor. You play a comical corgi, and if your friends jump in, they choose between a pug, a piglet, and a bipedal fish.Full keyboard and controller supportNeutralVery easy (for a platformer)Short - I honestly have no idea how I eked 7 hours out of it. I must have left it running.Bad#1 issue: While the game has full keyboard and controller support, you can NOT play with one person on the keyboard and on on the controller.Graphics are amateur, but as a mitigating factor, they're also charming and well-done for the price.Graphics are often scaled sloppily, resulting in sprites with blurry or pixelated lines. Graphics updates are coming at the time of writing, so this may change.Multiplayer is local only. This is mitigated by the fact that it seems intended as a couch game."

The game lacks a lot of features (customizable controls, video and audio settings), and requires a bit of a wonky workaround for SteamLink play, but for the price you get an incredibly fun game that really delivers in enjoyable local co-op.

Any game that can make her sit for that long is a plus for me.  The animation is cute and charming.  The gameplay is your basic platformer couch game.  The sound is crisp and lively.  The boss fights are challenging enough (until you figure out the pattern).  The only con is that it is repetative, but for the price and multiplayer, it can be ignored."

As you progress, the waves become bigger and the enemies more threatening.  You'll also encounter many, many mini-bosses along the way with their own combat patterns that will test your reflexes.The controls are simple and highly responsive.  Any timing errors were always my own fault, and the only time the game itself ever lagged was during the final stage, when the enemy swarms were ridiculously thick.It's not a short game, which is good on one hand, but on the other, it does start to get a bit repetitive in the end, which is the ONLY gripe I have.

,Recommended,414920,25278278,"Posted: 31 August, 2016",all,oni.ookami,"So this is a pretty fun game for a little bit of money. I got it for the local co-op because me and my girlfriend like playing games together on one screen. While it's a bit too hard for her, I think the difficulty's not too bad. If you're any good at bullethell games or learning enemy patterns quickly, you'll have no real problems either. Level design's pretty good and some parts reminded me of NES Contra and the Megaman series (though scaled down and more linear.) I haven't gotten to try the battle mode yet, but it looks interesting. The graphics are fun and the weapons are interesting and diverse enough for a short game like this. My main critiques are pretty much all technical things. I only have PS3 controllers (which worked fine) and since you can't change keybinds (without using an external program), the ""jump"" key is in a pretty awkward place. Being able to swap buttons around would be great. Also, it needs an easier difficulty for less experienced players. I could see my neices and nephews wanting to play a title like this and not being able to get anywhere on it. To be nitpicky, I guess, like most videogames, there's nothing to spend money on later in the game. I beat the last boss with almost 2000 gold. It's probably from playing steam games, but I kinda feel I should be able to buy some hats or something in it.  Maybe buy magic spell upgrades earlier than you would normally get them. Since this has almost been out for a year, I doubt a major patch is going to come to change these things, so maybe it'll change in a sequel. All in all, lotsa fun for a little price. Give it a try."

The art design is really cute and it feels good to plow through waves of enemies. But it sould have been about 3 worlds shorter. As you get towards the end of the game it might end up feeling tedious because there are so many bullet sponge enemies that take way too long to kill. If each of these types of enemies had maybe half as much health (including the bosses) then this game would be fairly solid for me. But each of these enemy types (especially the bosses) just take way too long to kill. The biggest reason I die is because there's just too much crap on the screen for me to dodge and I've already wasted all of my shield and healing and simply can't dodge enough to survive the encounter.But I would still recommend this game.  Like I said, for 3 dollars this is a great game. It's not fantastic and has a lot of room for improvement.

The multiplayer mode is like having 1 Sonic and three Tails. If you have low expectations then you should lower them further. This game could be for 5 year olds in 2003.

Such as turning sharply and not being able to turn around.Stage design isn't the best either, with the platforms being at the worst posible places. Just bits away from your feet or sometimes your playermodel is above the platform but it doesn't register.The good parts of this game areCool animationThats itOverall its a 2/10"

Definitely worth picking up for the price."

Where we upvote a terrible game?You can't hear the music over the sound effect of you shooting, the game gave me head pain, not a headache I mean it made my head hurt. Up on your controller moves you to the right. Right moves you right. Down...Moves you to the right.There is so much wrong that it is easier to describe the things the game does right. Local multiplayer works. The controls are responsive. The animations are simple and cartoony, they would fit right in for a webcomic. That is it. Everything else, is just not even bad, its a new kind of terrible, I would hand on heart go as far as to say it is horrible!I didn't play this game. I sat here, with a controller in my hand and things happened on the screen, monsters died, spells were cast but I was zoned out. I was on another planet because the game had hypnotized me. To say the game is ""easy"" is a understatement. It offers no challenge except you have to stay awake and focus on not walking into enemies.You have no invincibility frames and touching an enemy takes a lot of health very rapidly in addition there are instant death pits but you will only fall in those if you fall asleep.Enemies dont cause knock back on hit, which is a blessing to be fair but emphaises the overall lack of challenge the game presents and in multiplayer you become a moving wall of death.This game is suitable for one type of person only, those who have just had a labotomy.Even if we look at low skilled players, the game is just overall boring! Enemy variety is not mixed, your ""spells"" are so underpowered compared to your basic attack that you will forget to use them and aside from death on contact, most enemies are no threat at all.I think what offended me the most about the game, is that I zoned out completely and had a full converstation oblivious to the fact I was playing a game then suddenly snapped back to reality in world 10 of the game.Please avoid unless you are gifting this as punishment to someone.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews"

,Not Recommended,414920,31190398,Posted: 16 April,all,Freshy Fresh,I beat this game in 119 minutes and requested a refund. There aren't 100 levels or over 70 unique enemies. Maybe if they were counting the TOTAL enemies in the game it would add up to 70 or so. If you want something to play with your new born child or if you are autistic this is the game for you. Zero difficulty what-so-ever. The enemies do not knock you back when they cause damage. You can clip through objects and be killed by an instant death mechanic. No knock back whenever you touch enemies or I-frames so if you stand too close to an enemy you die. Even with those cheap deaths this game is far too easy.
