Everything is explained in this season that you would want to know in order to create your own game. Think of all of all the possibilities once you have gone through this . Before you know it you will be looking to add other features from other games or tutorials around the net. With the knowledge you learn here in coding you will have a solid base understanding to launch your game with."

I always enjoy learning like this; I am in an intermediate level and still I am watching this from the beginning because it teaches you several very valuable tips, so even if you are a pro you might learn something new and surprisingly useful.I am developing a commercial game and it's helping me a lot. The price is ridiculous in comparison with what you get, so I encourage you to support the Author ;)Congratulations to the author! Great professional and great person ;)"

We can all only wonder what GTGD S4 will bring.When I saw this, and played the demo, I just smiled. Really, thanks for makingthis ^_^ I will always remember staying up all night and falling asleep on my laptop when the first one came out. Thanks."

I’ve got Gigabytes of Youtube tutorials I’ve downloaded over time.GTGD S3 is the best, the pacing of the video is excellent, clear concise dialogue and excellent examples.If you want to learn how to make a game in Unity this is exactly what you need.If this had been over £100 I would still have bought it, that’s how good it is."

You dont need a previous knowledge in video game development. This course gives everything. Totally recommended.

76561198071105562,Recommended,415000,24514518,"Posted: 25 July, 2016",all,sfc_bluesky,"Usually you need to pay hundreds of dollars, if not more, to learn an incredible amount. You simply cannot miss when you're just paying $6.95 US for this gem!The first chapter is helpful for those new to Unity but the real meat of the learning comes in the chapters after that. The system created makes it extremely easy to customise weapons, items, enemies. You can also create and customise melee weapons, destructible objects and now videos to make AI for non-player-characters is possible. So you will have a really powerful, customisable and memory-efficient system.Videos are broken up into small chunks (usually between 3 and 10 minutes, but occasionally stretching to 15-20 minutes) covering only one section per video, which makes it extremely manageable for viewers, as opposed to 30 minutes or more with some other tutorials (or indeed many of the tute videos from Unity themselves).The guy doing the tutorials also has an extremely clear voice and is easy to understand. This makes the difference between him and other people who try to do Youtube tutorials.I could keep going, but hopefully I've already convinced you this is more than worth a few dollars!"

These are awesome and easy to understand.  There is a lot of information and explaination that help make a game properly.  I'm excited to see what I can develop when I get through this series.  Though these videos are easily accessed through youtube, I bought them to help support the making of this series."

I have had no programming experiance and i have learnt UI, AI, Raycasts + MORE.And you will be making a Game and understanding how to use all the features in your own games for the future.This is worth every penny spent.I know a course on programing would cost more than the asking price. And it keeps growing now we have melee systems to learn and more is still to come. (More AI & Vehicles)I have tried other software to accomplish building a game and always find out there systems are broken. So i thought why not learn Unity. Thanks to this i have found out i should have done this in the first place. I would have saved loads of money.Thanks.And Buy THIS if you want to learn Unity.All that is required is Time and Patience and a copy of Unity."

I have many Unity books that don't go to the point of my learning needs, GTGD is raycasting all the points I need. Maybe some exclusive videos for Steam supporters could be a plus+. Thanks"
76561198035865217,Recommended,415000,24806479,"Posted: 10 August, 2016",all,Wardiaper,"The best money you will ever spend to learn how to make games in Unity beginning with zero knowledge.  The price is tiny compared to the value you receive.  You can view all the vids for free on the developer's youtube channel but should support, even the tiny bit it costs on steam, his efforts and generosity in sharing his knowledge for absolute beginners to encourage him to continue this great work.  I actually watch the vids directly from the install folder or on youtube instead of through steam is why my hours are so low on steam.Just bought another copy for a 10-year-old family member and we are going to work through this course together.And a personal thank you to the dev for creating this course, so well thought out, so thorough, a fantastic job teaching, and continuing to add more vids (now up to 170+ videos) covering all the game systems.  It probably cost more to get this on steam than you have gotten back in sales."

You talk so fast and type the code so fast it is hard to keep up and understand exactly what is happening. You provide plenty of info but just slow down a little.Otherwise, AWESOME. Thanks for making this.I have a game released on an Indie site and a VR game released on Steam but I was the producer and level designer, and with this, I hope to be able to at least understtand the code my monkeys put out!

76561198379531254,Recommended,415000,35267094,Posted: 28 September,all,astonvar,"Brilliant. This system is the CORRECT way to make a FPS system with Unity. Highly recommended. I come from a development background of many years experience. These tutorials are excellent for no experience AND those of us with many years of game development experience. I rarely post reviews, but feel it is warranted because the quality of these tutorials and the system has blown me away.Furthermore, it's worth far more than the asking price. As others have mentioned, there are other guides that cost much more and don't deliver. The professionalism behind GTGD S3 makes it stand out. If GTGD S3 had a marketing department, it would easily be selling hundreds/thousands a month.Having direct access to the original scripts has allowed me to save heaps of time with the debugging process. This alone is worth the cost, because even an hour of my time is far more expensive than the price of this package.  The videos are available for free on Youtube, so the real value is having access to the scripts for ease of debugging.I could go on, but for brevity will keep it brief.If you want to learn how to make a stable, reliable, and efficient FPS system with Unity, this is a MUST-have."

He is in depth and concise most of the time and takes time to explain a bit outside of the subject so you do have to pay attention. Well worth the money to keep him in business. 10/10 but there are a couple things you do need to do.1) keep a finger on the pause key because I think he is on speed when he types and I can't see what the heck he is doing sometimes.2) He uses script for everything so some of the shortcuts that you could use will have to be learned by you on your own. I personally don't mind this as this is what I need brushing up on but others might find this tedious so just pause and read up the unity manual at those points.Otherwise a great tutorial and well worth the bucks and time. I would recommend you just watch hime go through ALL the videos first then go with his instructions the second time around, that way it is eeasier to learn what he is doing and you can be faster on the pause and back up for the vids, believe me you will wear them out lol."
