I have to swap this review to a positive one now.OLD REVIEW BELOW (Negative review)1. Brilliant ideaThe premise of this game is amazing. No cheap back story, no ""Lost My Memory"" BS... it's a similar concept to movies such as ""The Cube"", Hunger Games, etc.Right now, hunger/stamina etc drain too quickly for my liking; it forces you to be moving, hunting - but I think it needs to be tweaked to about 75% of its' current drain rate.Combat, I don't enjoy it TBH. I understand why it is like it is.. and it would be MUCH better if I could use my own keybinds.Please let me disable the tutorial after the 4th run. it LITERALLY gets in the way of combat.Best I've got to so far is 84. I'm a scrub, I know... Time to go and die again. We need a Neutral Review option, STEAM!"
,Recommended,415010,30190161,Posted: 26 February,all,Guennol,"Don't be fooled by the island setting with its hilltop radar tower, this isn't reminiscent of relaxed walking sim Dear Esther in the slightest! There's no atempt to sugar coat the violence here - more Battle Royale or Gantz than Hunger Games.Really really loved the premise, and the game's taking a risk that pays off in not spoon feeding it to you. The atmosphere, music etc are all great -as are touches like the wristwatch. Collectables and hidden secrets are already making the world feel alive. This is definitely not a blank heightmapped sandbox; the world has personalityThe problem is that everything's building really effective tension towards combat encounters which don't yet deliver the visceral thrills that they need to. It's in these moments that you're reminded that this is an Early Access title. Sadly, they also pulled me right out of the great atmosphere that had been building.When the other 99 kill each other, there's a neat in-world notification and a genuine thrill. Right now, though, it feels like they're having too much of the fun when it comes to the murder-fest of the premise.Looking forward to seeing if the devs can build on the visceral combat experience they're clearly aiming for!"

I died several times only because the AI has infinite stamina and I don't. This would be acceptable if I was fighting some sort of monster, but the fact that I'm fighting other humans who are probably in worse physical shape than I am due to them being on the island longer doesn't help the game's case. This may be Early Access, but broken hitboxes, AI enemies that are infinitely stronger than you, and the inability to turn off the nauseating motion blur are all problems that I would expect the developers to fix before Early Access, or day one of EA. I might come back to the game later, but now, I'm taking my refund and leaving it at that."
76561197969050496,Recommended,415010,26313543,"Posted: 30 October, 2016",all,Bushell,"I stumbled across this game looking for something to keep me entertained one cold, dark evening around Halloween and hit upon a diamond in the rough.You wake up on an island shrouded in mystery with no company or resources but what 'They' provide and what your wits can conjure. I absolutely love the concept and can't wait to see the different ways that things can unfold within the world. Speaking of the world, it has been beautifully detailed and well planned out. By cresting some of the hills in the game, you can catch glimpses of civilisation in the distance and leaves you wondering how each of those might fit into the story behind the scenes. The map is a great touch by the way - it really is how I imagine someone in that situation would annotate their location.For me, it is the minor details in this bleak island setting that work so well and really bring the concept to life - paranoid men surrounding their camps with alarm traps, curious notes hinting at a much bigger picture, messages and annotations left by others in their slow but inevitable descent into madness! There is enough mystery surrounding each element and locale within the game that there is a huge amount of potential for story line development and I can't wait to get stuck into it.That being said, no game is perfect and this one is no different. The combat is a little straightforward - although the block mechanic is there, it will largely go unused by the majority of players. If you can figure out a way to get the NPCs to occasionally block your attacks and cause a slight stun during which they can attack back, that might largely sort out the issue. It would also be nice to have a wider range of voices but I appreciate it is early doors for this game, and that can easily be patched in later. It's not all doom and gloom though! The range and use of weapons available is well thought out (and thematically realistic!), and the graphical result of each attack being visible on the targets is a nice touch.I personally would love to see more diversification in the amount of social and psychological interactions between The Other 99. If a group of random people were trapped and stranded on an island, while there are notes that hint at bigger societies or those that do not wish to partake in violence, it would be great if some NPCs would exhibit these features. For instance, some might run when they see you, or potentially a small group could be 'ruled over' by an alpha male who uses violence to keep his men in line, but still alive and ready to defend their camp or assault others.Overall though, there is so much potential in this game. I think once a few issues are ironed out, all the foundations are in place to create an excellent example of the genre!The Other 99 looks like it could be the one stand-out game in a hundred if it continues to develop in the same vein - I'm looking forward to seeing what you make of it!"

It runs well with an occassional dip but nothing like stagger like one would suffer on something such as Ark. I like the map, though I hope the inhabitents become more diverse than ""some cockney bloke and one black guy"" according to a previous review. My only major gripe with the game is the combat. It's a mess, its lackluster, I'm constantly breaking autolock when trying to target my mouse and when I do succed in slaugther, it just isn't anywhere close to satisfying.With that said, I have an instinctual trust in these developers in particular and hope they improve on what they have to make something truly wonderful.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwauYsTKkU0&feature=youtu.be"

It has been a while since I really was blown away from audio design within games. The only thing which doesn't match that yet are the voices from the enemies. Especially if they claim to be friendly, their shoutings are way too loud.Besides that I must agree with most reviews so far: The atmosphere is a big plus. Just played the recent update and must say the game got better over time. It had a rumpy start but slowly the devs are taking it to a new level. Although I still feel a bit clueless in the beginning of a new round. I've read a lot in the update history and in the forums and that's why I understand what is going on but without that, with just the game, it'd be a bit thin and hard to understand what is happening in there."

My english is not very great but i can express myself and its barely understandable.About this game : We can cleary feel the inspiration of BATTLE ROYAL in this game and its something really appreciate in the survival game player communauty.Yup i like this concept and i really like the graphics the ambiant of the light the time of the day the meteo and few more things bringing a personnality to the game.Its an early access and for sure there is many things to bring as always... not a scoop! So i will not talk about theses littles things that you are surely know already and working on it with your priorities ;)Except one little things because he was the most painful in my experience in the game. The game seems well optimised but the loading is making little freeze and sometimes its happening again and again. I have GTX970 4Gb i5 6400 16Gb RAM.Okay so now i told about that for my own pleasure i wish to express how i feel the game about his future. The game could have a HUGE potential but if you guys will took the right decision about his direction.The concept of the BATTLE ROYAL in solo game never got seen before and i can understain thats something to care. I found the HUD really great about the food and the water forcing the player to moove and kill the others survivor!!! Its this kind of things that i wish to see in a PVP multiplayer for sure and specially in a Battle royal where 98 others people are connected rushing to be the last one!I read in the forum that your team wish to focus about the solo gameplay and im not saying that should be taked!But actually the gameplay in the solo mode is too easy. The system of fight is original but too simple since we just have to spam the hit and find and keep the good weapon... But the AI will be improved since its an early access. But the AI will never took the place of the real time fight with the real players.All of this to say... this game got a good concept and could be huge in multiplayer. Dont miss the call and keep the solo mod and took the good direction... the direction of the players needs ;)Good job and keep going! I will keep an eye about this game

Love the hardcore idea of death being a permenant fixture, rather than any sort of autosave/checkpoint system every 6 feet, it makes you genuinely weigh up the choices, 'rather than bash every person's head in, maybe I should sneak around'. Sound mix is really cool, (I wandered into a metal container to look for things and you could hear the rain plinking off the metal)If this is what Early release looks like can't wait for the finished article!

Obviously, they realised the issue as combat in the new version is now so much more challenging. Really big improvement. I have to say though, that what made the game for me was the atmosphere. It is AMAZING. And so creepy, especially when the watch beeping cuts across the audio.Looking forward to watching the devs improve the game more. My final comments would be that the AI needs work and that the game could run a little better."
,Recommended,415010,29436190,Posted: 22 January,all,Cornelius McMeme,"My first experience playing The Other 99:After waking up from the worst hangover ever and discovering all my friends had left me and gone home, I decided I needed to get up and find my way back to my place. All I knew was that I had to go ‘through the other 99’ as it was on a note I must have left myself before passing out. The problem was that I couldn’t seem to find ‘the other 99’ so I headed off in search of someone that I could ask for directions. I immediately find a homeless man sleeping on the floor but decide not to wake him as I don’t have any change on me so I continue on alone. After a little bit I see someone sitting by a camp-fire in the distance and walk down towards them. I tried to introduce myself but they seemed very unwilling to speak to me sensibly and at one point was really rude so I decided to beat them to a pulp with a stick and leave their corpse in the forest to rot.It was at that moment in time that I discovered my wrist-watch was broken and wasn’t telling me the correct time, I must have hit it while I was ♥♥♥♥-faced the night before and now it won’t stop bleeping. I headed towards a lighthouse that I saw in the distance and quickly bump into a man running around with his shirt off. Although it’s clear to me that he is off his♥♥♥♥♥♥I notice that he has a watch on so I approach in hopes of asking him the time. Despite my best efforts to calm him down he continued to run around shouting for me to leave him alone so I decide to give chance.Suddenly out of nowhere someone else appears and holds a knife up to my face, I know at this point that I’m getting robbed so I turn around in an attempt to get away but discover I’ve been surrounded by a group of skinheads and have no way of leaving. What I didn’t know was that the skinheads weren’t actually after me, as all three of them began stabbing each other with a variety of different things while I stood nearby and spectated. I can only guess but I believe I found myself in the middle of some territory war, as these men seemed very angry at each other. I continue to watch them stab each other to death while enjoying a fresh can of peaches that I’d picked up earlier.Once there was only one left I offered him some peaches to celebrate his victory but he decided instead that he’d rather kill me and despite my best efforts to defend myself he unfortunately succeeded and I found myself taking my last breath before fading into a deep and endless sleep.All in all it was a pretty weird day for me, but I’m glad that I went through it as now I have time to reflect on what happened and I truly believe I’ve come out of it a better person. Also the game is good."

But hey, that's what a personal review is for, right? The Other 99 drops you on a not-so-lonely island with a watch on your left arm which says ""99"". This number stands for the other survivors. And suddenly a beep can be heared and the number dropped to 98. And it drops. And it keeps dropping. Whenever I heared the sound I felt somehow... bad. The game is depressing - in a good way.It is still Early Access. Sure. The combat system, even reworked, still is a bit clunky. And I heavily miss crafting. But for what it is and what it can be, my god, that idea is amazing and I hope the developers keep updating the game. There is so much potential - and already a chunk of it has been used."

Combat used to be a bit bothersome but they refined it in the last patch and it feels much more satisfying now.

Sound design is great and I've crapped my pants several times playing this game so far.

The combat has improved quite a bit since the game has come out. It now works really well if you're playing with KB/MThe world is really cool, and super atmospheric. You get the feeling that there is way more going on, judging by the CCTV everywhere.The graphics and sound are really good, especially when you think that this is a game in early access. The rolling thunder really hits hard, and the changing weather effects and day night cycle ensure you have to keep thinking about your approach, be it night, day or if it's hard to see through the pouring rain.I'm sure this game will keep improving as more features are added in, but it's definitely worth your time if you enjoy survival action games.

I wonder how the story will evolve and where all this will end up.Thanks to the unreal engine the game looks really good. The devteam seems to know how to make use of it.

[Edit: some issues have been fixed already]This game shows a lot of promise. Great concept, you and 99 others are deposited on an island where you are supposed to kill each other for some unknown watchers. they even have cameras all over the place that you can throw rocks at. you can rambo your way around the place killing everybody you see or you can just sit and watch in the bushes as everybody else kills each other. really liked the idea so I threw down the money and gave it a shot.Right away it starts out nice, you wake up, very little in the way of exposition, and go. and from this point on your dreams are shattered as everything else about the game sucks [Edit] Things are being fixed and it shows good promise. I'm eager to see what other changes they will impliment in the coming months.[Edit] The Combat has been much improved, the changes to the controls are a lot better then what they were, at least for me. I'm still a bit iffy on the stealth aspect but I would like to play with it a bit more.One of the things I noticed right away was that I was exploreing the map very quickly. I had made it all the way to the other side while only running into a few dudes. I thought it was weird because the game says 99 people and unless 80 of them where all hiding in a cave someplace then there must be more to it then my map. like another side of the island or something. so I kept exploreing, uncovered most of the map killed a few more people and when I finally got my tracked down to 69 people left a messaged appeard and said press ""V"" to see it. so I did and it gave me a ""well done!"" message. like I was finished. it said that I could keep going and explore the Island some more and that people would RESPAWN. I was baffled. I immediately had to kill the guys I just killed again and I just quit the game. Nothing about the game is what it should be in my opinion. I really want to see where they go but they need to fix a lot of stuff for me to pick this one up again.Fix the combat, fix the stealth, fix the graphics, add in the rest of the advertised game and maybe you got something. [Edit] They are making these changes. The update makes a huge difference in how the game feels and I'm very glad for it. I'll be keeping my eye out for future changes. Not often do I find games that I'm initially disappointed with that show so much renewed promise after only a short while.

Very much like battle royale (2000), or the condemned (2007).You travel around the island, fight other survivors and solve puzzles. You have a watch like arm-computer thing that counts down the other survivor's who will kill eachother as well, adding a bit of realism to it. but after it goes down to a certain ammount it will stop, and you will get a prompt that says enemies will spawn continuously because they haven't finished making the end part of the game yet.It's not a complete game, but it's fun for what it is.

Jumping in to this game I had no idea what to expect, but as I played through I began to quickly understand what was going on on this isolated island. Just exploring the island alone is scary enough, however, only when the number on your watch starts to depleat do you understand that the other occupants are biginning to kill each other. This for me added so much to the experience. You no longer feel like you're at the top of the food chain. There are others on this island who just as desperate as you are to survive.The combat is brutal, although, a lot of fun. It feels a lot like Chivalry's combat system only faster pased and real. It is very satistfying to land a few hits on your opponent before finishing them off with a swift blow to the head.I cannot wait for what the developers have to offer in the near future. I would highly reccommend this game to anyone who is in search of something new to fully immerse themselves into. From what I understand there are some interesting updates to come!

You can crouch, but the actual machanic for it is tedious on a kb, versus the way you can with a controller stick.Then I hit combat. What a jumbled mess of twitchy, unresponsive stabbing in the dark. Slamming my mouse all over the place just to hit something? And half the time I was in some mouse mode where that does nothing so I being beaten on and not able to attack back? I don't get it. It seems they wanted something different and instead they tried to reinvent the wheel. What's wrong with Left Click Attack?
