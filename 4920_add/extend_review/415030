76561198060527161,Not Recommended,415030,19422841,"Posted: 1 December, 2015",all,Sir Slush,"So, let me start by saying One More Dungeon isn't a bad game. If you're a fan of first-person shooters and dungeon crawlers, you might enjoy it. But the game does have a severe lack of content, and in the end, I wouldn't recommend it for most people.The TL;DR:Take a look at the trailer. See all the cool pieces of gameplay it shows you?Well, they aren't pieces. That's the entire game.First, the good. The game has three main components to equipment - your weapon, your staff, and your artifact. While the weapons are all pretty much the same in their operation (the biggest difference being about two in-game feet of range between dagger and spear), magic and artifacts can be more interesting.Most of your magic will work the same in the beginning- it will cast a fire-and-forget sphere that  costs a certain number of crystals split between fire, ice and acid, doing those kinds of damage respectively (in some cases, also physical damage). Later in the game, you will also find piercing magic, exploding magic, and beam magic, to name a few.Artifacts range from healing you when you drink poison to turning enemy corpses into more gemstones to a fairly luck-based healing item, and provide most of the game's variety.Finally, the inclusion of 'portal rooms' - that is, one of a set of challenges to provide the player with more equipment or artifacts - can help break up the monotony of the rest of the dungeon.That word, monotony, can be used to sum up the game's bad points. The dungeons are all fairly similar to one another, since the five environments may as well be reskins for all of the variety of challenge they provide. One room will quickly blend into another, and you will find yourself using the in-game map to navigate more often than by actually remembering which room lead to which.Speaking of navigating, it's something that takes a major chunck of your time in this game. While the dungeon splits into several pathways, the overarching structure is usually that of a pair of intertwining snakes or a starfish - very few 'arms' connect with one another, meaning that after you have followed a long series of rooms and passageways that all feel the same, you'll find that you have to turn around and wander right back through them again. If you like to clear out dungeons looking for loot, I estimate that roughly 1/4 of your playtime will be walking through empty passages that you've already cleared, watching the in-game map.The enemies you face tend to follow one of two basic attack patterns - they will either charge straight toward you, or will  hold off at a medium distance and fire ranged attacks at you. In both cases, they are easy to defeat and have nearly the same AI between every enemy from level 1 to level 8, the final level of the game. The only differences will be their movement speed, their damage, and the number of blows to finish them. After an hour or two of playing, they no longer present any mental challenge and the process of 'fighting' them becomes a simple rinse-and-repeat of attack, move backwards, attack. Or, if you've got enough crystals to support magical combat, your attack pattern will be fire and fire again.The damage types of magic make no difference to most of the enemies in the game. There is one dungeon guardian (AKA boss) who is slightly resistant to elemental damage, and one enemy type that is slightly resistant to physical damage, but otherwise damage is damage, be it fire, acid, or physical.Finally, the modifiers you can unlock to change up the game don't do their job very well. They can change the difficulty by adding health, lowering the health of enemies, reducing visual clarity, increasing the number of enemies or even limiting the player to one hit point, but they tend not to change the monotonous tone of the game or the mental processes used to play it. The one exception is a curse that constantly drains health from the player, which encourages players to race through the game as fast as possible.As to music and visuals, they each belong to player preference. I normally prefer pixel graphics, but I felt it didn't click as well for this game as it does for many others. The soundtrack was also tiresome in my ears, but as tastes vary between gamers, I suspect this will not be the case for everyone.In summary, the game plays more like a concept piece or techical demo than a finished product. The core gameplay is solid and doesn't have any real technical flaws, but there is very little of it and there's not enough variety to sustain most players over repeated runs.If this seems contrary to what the positive reviews say, take a look at how long they've played. The game's real flaws only start to become apparent after a few hours.That being said, it's cheap, it works and it's usually fair, so if you're a major fan of the first-person dungeon crawler, you might get your money's worth from it anyway. For anyone else, I'd recommend you keep searching."

Knowledge of the different enemies will also come to help, as some of them you should be taking on with ranged weapons.- Conserve your staff crystals, save these for situations where you are outnumbered, or when you are facing enemies that cannot be kited with close combat safely.- The game really requires you to balance your resources, and as a roguelike it will vary quite a bit through sheer luck run to run, but that is often the nature of the beast with these types of games.- There are often secret doors you can activate at the end of seemingly dead-end tunnels, always check where it seems there could or should be one.- Most every level has a portal leading to an eldritch-themed area with a random challenge for some potentially good loot, some of them just give you some coins or other goodies with no challenge involved if you are lucky. When you leave these portals, that portal for the level locks for good, so make sure you are finished in there before returning.- Some levels have chests with rare treasure, but not every level has silver keys to use on these chests, as far as I can tell. It's frustrating if you reach your first chest without a key on that level, but hey, it's a hard game.I'll update this as I play further through the game, for me it was definitely worth the 5 dollars for the enjoyment I am getting out of it. Music is fairly basic, but serviceable I suppose. Art style is great, and the atmosphere and environmental sound effects are pretty good.That's it for now, hope you found this useful.- Hamster Huey"

It has everything you need in a good roguelike:- Easy mechanics- Every run is different- Challenging difficulty- Huge variety of loot- Great level design- Secret rooms- Amazing soundtrack- Beating a level is very rewarding- And many more features that suit this game perfectlyIn my opinion this game deserves to be played a lot more. Also frequent updates make the game even more interesting. One of the things that bothered me in the beginning though was the fact that you can't turn your view up or down. You can only turn your view to the left and to the right but after an hour of playing this will become completely normal.All in all One More Dungeon is a great game and has lots of potential of becoming one of the best roguelikes out there.

Soon after purchasing, I saw a HUGE flaw in the game. It gets so repetitive and the different enemy varieties and mutators do not break up the dullness of this title. All you have to do is aim shots with the staff and then you'll basically beat the game. Just keep on doing that. There's no penalty crystals are readily available.

,Not Recommended,415030,26349828,"Posted: 1 November, 2016",all,Denilson Sá,"Is it a bad game? No.Is it a great game? No.This game tries to simulate the look and feel of early first person shooters. Unfortunately, although I like the look, I dislike the general gameplay.- Most enemies are silent or near-silent. In Wolfenstein 3D, you could hear the enemies shouting, so you knew you had to do something to avoid damage. In One More Dungeon, you start taking damage, then you try looking around to find where the enemy is. By the time you locate it, you lost at least a quarter of your total life.- The weapons have a delay. In Wolfenstein 3D, and in most shooters, the attack is instantaneous. It doesn't matter if that's realistic or not, that's fun to play. In One More Dungeon, there is a long delay between clicking the mouse button and attacking. And this delay increases on certain weapons. This makes the gameplay boring, and also makes it more likely to get hurt before being able to hit the enemy.- Melee combat is basic and annoying. Truth to be told, melee combat in most first-person games is awful. This game follows this trend.- Although I like the pixelated look, I dislike how it affects the gameplay. There is so much decoration everywhere that it is hard to see enemies, which sometimes are behind the decoration. The wall graphics are also too busy, making it even harder to see the enemies against them.- The randomly generated levels don't make any sense and feel… random! Wolfenstein 3D had hand-crafted levels that made logical sense, and that had unique visuals and decorations so that we could orient ourselves even without a map. In this game, however, the map is pretty much required.- Poorly designed random items. I've had a run where I found 2 chests and no keys (until I died, of course). I found 2 or 3 daggers (in addition to the dagger we start with), and 3 staves of the same kind that I already had. All of those were useless drops. And I ran out of crystals because I had ""bad luck"" and only found crystals of the other kinds. For comparison, Crypt of the NecroDancer also has random levels, but it always spawns a certain number of diamonds per level, and always spawns a key whenever a locked chest shows up.- Lack of Steam Cloud. This game has some progression to buy/unlock mutators. However, there is no Steam Cloud support.Overall, it is not a ""bad"" game, but it is poorly designed.Try playing these games instead: Wolfenstein 3D, Eldritch, Rise Of The Triad (the original one), Rogue Legacy, Crypt of the NecroDancer."

,Not Recommended,415030,22016221,"Posted: 23 March, 2016",all,gr8stalin's mustache!,"On one hand, I really don’t want to bash someone’s lone coding attempts because it’s great when you design something from the ground up and after putting in work, you have a product you can actually feel proud about that you can sell to people; mad respect. However, on the other hand, One More Dungeon would be worth recommending if:There was more to gameplay strategy outside of +back against melee foes and alternate strafing and left click against ranged foesAll of the “cool” weapons shown in the gameplay footage weren't shoved into the end of the game or a really really lucky chest openingLevels were more open. I get that it’s supposed to be akin to a dungeon crawler but I’m not exactly asking for Lichdom Battlemage-tier empty expanses, just a bit more room for actual strategy and/or movementIt didn’t feel like I was burning money every time I used a wand; it was REALLY easy to get screwed because there were magic crystals for all of the wands except the one you’re actually usingThere weren’t any enemies that seriously obstructed your vision. Vision obstruction in a first person game is actually the worst design choice imaginable if the game is going to be about funAnd most importantly if:When I did eventually die, I actually felt like playing one more life. BoI and FTL always have me coming back for another round, but dying in OMD just made me question if I wanted to even keep it installed on my system.The currently top-rated review is 100% right: OMD is monotonous. I don't feel too bad about sinking $5 into it and it's always great to see someone actually think about Linux when it comes to supported OSes, but even though Delver might be in Early Access Hell, they've still got a better formula going on than OMD. If you've got $5 to spend and want to give it a shot regardless of reviews, go nuts, but I'd say if you want to spend $5 just put it in your Steam Wallet or something."

While it is a little light on the content it does exactly what the title implies: it makes sure you keep coming back for one more dungeon (and then another). Every time you get just a little bit further, every time you find a different item. It is all very enjoyable, and for just under 5 euro you just can't let this game go by.But let me get a little bit more into the gameplay itself. One More Dungeon has a very charming aesthetic with pixel graphics in a 3D environment. Everytime you spawn the dungeon floor is randomly generated. The goal is to get to the end of the floor and descend to the next one. But in order to do that you need to slay a boss and get the seal.You are armed with an iron dagger and a magical staff. While the staff is ranged and more powerful it uses colored crystals as a resource so it's uses are finite. That creates a nice tension that adds to the atmosphere. If you are chased down by snails and rats and run out of crystals it creates an exhilerating moment. Enemies also get harder as you get to later levels. Luckily there are a lot of things to find. For example, there are different potions, melee weapons like spears and axes and a variety of magical staffs. In a later level you can even find a magic staff that fires homing bug bombs.There are more secrets to find (portals, shops) but it might be more fun to find out for yourself. For only 5 euro you could have many hours of fun in this game. Highly recommended!If you are still not sure about buying this game check out the Youtube video I recorded on this game!https://youtu.be/Pr6JG1nhqbw"

,Recommended,415030,19254179,"Posted: 24 November, 2015",all,Vagrant Gamer,"Stately Snail's maiden voyage ""One More Dungeon"" shows us just what the love child of Doom and Minecraft would look like.In what has some would call the “year of the indie game,” 2015 seems to have shifted the focus of video games from big budget triple A titles.  Games like  Axiom Verge, Undertale, and Downwell are prime examples of developers appealing to an audience that prefers a classic style and challenging gameplay rather than big budget set pieces, season passes, and online multiplayer.  One More Dungeon seeks to make its mark on the indie scene by creating a hybrid style that blends retro gameplay in a modern genre and the result is a short and sweet adventure that keeps you coming back for more.At first glance One More Dungeon appears to be a quick and easy dungeon crawl that players can speed through with staff and sword in hand, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake.  In reality, OMD is classified as “rogue-like”a genre that rewards survival and earning as many rewards in one playthrough, before you die and begin again at level one.  With the threat of perma death always looming overhead, every time you progress feels very satisfying and keeps you interested to see what lies ahead.The game begins by presenting  you with a list of perks that are all locked in the beginning but can be unlocked by slaying monsters and earning points, which are redeemable at the main menu after you die.  These perks range from super helpful, such as “Don't Hurt Me,” which allows you to begin the game with an extended maximum amount of health, and “Alchemist,” which provides you with extra healing potions at the start, to perks that greatly increase the challenge like  “Fog,” which significantly reduces the player's vision. Successfully completing a level with one of the more difficult perks active is extremely satisfying and kept me playing way longer than I had originally expected.One More Dungeon's gameplay is a prime example of the easy to learn, difficult to master format.  Each level contains a level boss; a super powerful monster that contains the key which unlocks the door to the next level.  Players begin the game at level one with two weapons; a staff in the left hand and a melee weapon in the right.  The staff spawns with a random magical attribute of the ice,fire or poison variety. However, the different types of magic didn't appear to matter as each staff seemed to deal the same amount of damage. The real trick to each staff is the type of energy it uses, this energy takes the form of crystals (that are red, blue and green respectively) which the player is given a set amount of at the onset of the game and is able to collect more through his or her adventure. Depending on the type of staff equipped each blast consumes a set amount of crystals. Entry level staves only consume two crystals per shot, whereas specialized versions such as the wind staff consume one of each crystal per blast. Keeping an eye on the amount of crystals you have is key to survival in the later levels. When sorcery fails you will be forced to rely on your trusty steel. You begin the game with a simple iron dagger that deals a small amount of damage. More powerful weapons can be found within each level of varying range and damage. Finding an early weapon upgrade can easily make all the difference in later levels.While your equipment is key to your survival, the dungeon provides you with additional items and buffs to keep you in the fight. Special Shrines are scattered through out that provide you with permanent health boosts as well as fortifying your Wisdom, which is used to power secret relics found with special abilities such as the cursed doll, which causes enemies to explode upon their death. While these relics are very few and far between they can be extremely helpful in a tight spot. Additionally, many powerful weapons and items can be purchased at shops that randomly appear in each level.  These items are shown in glass display cases and must be purchased with rare “skull coins” that can be found among enemies or hidden in secret passages. While the game does give you quite a few tools to aid in your survival it remains very challenging. There were several occasions where I entered a new level with plenty of resources, only to have my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me halfway though. Each floor presents a new roster of enemies with more health and devastating projectile attacks that really force you to think before you engage in combat.OMD's style is definitely the icing on this indie cake as the graphics do a fantastic job of reminding you of classic first person shooters like DOOM (I'm looking at you character portrait) and the always pleasing 8-bit  aesthetics of Minecraft in the way the environment looks, as well as the way the attack animations behave. Each dungeon is randomly generated, meaning there's always a new room to explore each time you begin the game and there are plenty of secret levels and items that I won't spoil in this review. However, like many games OMD is not without it's flaws. The dungeons themselves often feel claustrophobic with a ceiling that seems too low and tight corners that make it difficult to move. Additionally, there are several pieces of the environment that seem like you should be able to interact with but serve no purpose other than to get in your way and in some instances obstruct treasure chests in such a way that you can open them but not get around them to obtain the item. Graphics aside, each level has it's own unique sound track, unfortunately these tracks are quite basic and also very short, causing the loop to become annoying on particularly long dungeon crawls. Technically speaking the game runs great. It's a small game and downloads quickly. The only issue I ran into during my time with it was when I went to ALT-TAB out of the game this caused the mouse to not stick within the game and would result in you clicking “out” and resulted in several deaths. The only way I found to resolve this issue was to go into the settings and toggle full screen off and then on again. All in all these seem like minor complaints, but with a game this small tiny issues add up quickly.Overall I enjoyed my time with One More Dungeon. It's a small game that presents a big challenge to those willing to explore to the deepest levels, and while it was frustrating at times it's classic charm, engaging combat, and constant surprises kept me coming back for more. Players looking for deep mechanics and an a story line may wish to give OMD a pass, but if it's a quick and easy game to play while killing time, or even a bit of adventure before bed your looking for, you  will feel right at home with. One More Dungeon. On the whole this game was well worth the price and I look forward to developer Stately snail's next endeavor."

It runs out SO fast you might as well be leaking it. Once you run out, you're going melee but again, it's so hit or miss you should just accept your demise then and there.I wanted to like this game and I'll be honest: if you get it at this sale price, you might find worth in it.

,Recommended,415030,26190613,"Posted: 23 October, 2016",all,Markus,"One More Dungeon is a neat little 360°-shooter / Doomclone in pixel aesthetic and an Loot/Inventory system.You're fighting your way through procedurally generated Dungeons with themes that range from your regular medieval cellar, over poisonous caves, monster intestines to lovecraftian alien planes of existence.You do so in the most two-fisted way possible - casting spells via a staff in your left hand and fighting in melee with your right. Both are uprgradable with loot, once in a while there is a merchant shop, and also there are potions. (don't go by color here - read the names.). There also seems to be some kind of sanity-meter.The game contains hints of oldschooled movement-based combat, but doesn't do so with it's last consequence. For example - it's impossible to win melee without taking damage, and healing / recovery potions can be very scarce.Enemy design feels a lot like One More Dungeon's designer is trying to appeal to a very specific aethetic, remeniscent of the NES. If you like cutsy Caterpillars and big-headed Zombies, this might be for you.The pixel-look seems quite overdone - even Classic Wolfenstein's resolution is better. It is quite neatly animated tho. I also like the Idea of mutators to add additional replay value, I'd just wish that 'broken cartridge' would be glitchier. It also got a pretty neat atmospheric soundtrack.Overall, it could be a lot better, but for what it is, and for that price point - you should get it if you're the Dungeon-crawler kind of person, or if you like retro-styled 1st gen FPS or even Doomclones."

In addition, I would like to see this game introduce more features asked by the community like ""Crafting"" and perhaps in the future if ever ""Multiplayer"" even though as I previously stated that they would not perform this update for that feature it would still be a nice thing to add.Summary:In summary, this game is very fun and enjoyable if you like Binding of Isaac and DOOM/Quake. It's kinda like a mix between both with the two games and it brings some things new to the table and leaves some out that I feel coul have given it a higher score. However they don't plan on Multiplayer as said in discussions the game on its own could be a fun party game where you can make your friends see how long they go without dying or going on specific runs with the modes you can choose before you start the game. As you load in the game for the first time you load into a room with most likely no enemies, you then escape the womb of the first room and experience the new rooms and doors that have crates and enemies of which you can loot & slay. Like in Binding of Isaac, there are chests, and these chests do require a key which is a rare item that comes from finding them in crates, enemies, or laying around in the dungeon (Which can be a confusing factor for new players.) Nonetheless it still makes the game challenging and fun for new players. What I found enjoyable was the portals which are in rooms that look really odd with a purpleish other planet life on the floor, like the grass is turned into eyeballs and things are twisted only in that room. Once you enter the portal you are most likely to A: Walk into enemies and find a rare item, B: Find a token room where you can spend your points on Ice, Fire, and Acid crystals, you also will find health point and sanity vendor, Or C: Where you do a small course or juke objects and collect your loot that way. Shops in this game exist where you can find tokens throughout the dungeons and use them on the shop ranging from 2 - 4+ tokens. No bugs to be found so far and it's remarkable for an indie game. I highly suggest you should buy this game and give it a try."

You will have find to find resources, killing enemies, avoiding traps and killing the ""Big"" enemy that holds the exit key on each floor. The game is first person camera view and it is pixelated. You have an inventory tool bar and a backpack However the toolbar is very limited and items will not stack on top of each other if you have more then one. There are 3 different magic staves in the game and with each of their own shots.  You also start with a sword and a map. You are able to find upgradeable items to boost your power. There are secret area's and objects. You can destroy objects to find some loot or even enemies. There is a score but who cares about that, The game gets rather difficult though and im not sure if the game has a high replayability.Music is looping over and over and doesn't seem to have a huge variety into it. But the music isn't that bad.The hitbox is almost or close to ""perfect"". Which means, Objects/enemies/shots hitboxes are on pinpoint. Which is really good.Games are saved on the start of each floor. So if ur gonnna quit the run or stop in a middle of a run. You will have to redo the entire floor over again and every progress on that floor is gone.Whenever you are using the artefact effect. Your mind energy will be dropped. If this is too low, you will take damage and random monsters will be able to spawn to attack you. Killing enemies will gain Mind energy. (Yellow heart).There are mutators to make your game easier or more harder. You are able to buy and unlock them with ""score"" points.You are not required to play with those mutators but there are some achievements however.Other things.Objects that can't be destroyed could block your way, which could be annoying sometimes.The face has a Wolfenstein/Doom reference.You are able to see on the map for ""interacting"" objects.Those ""eyed"" Portals COULD BE dangerous and could be interesting and worthy items inside.-------------------I Give this game a 7/10"

One you replace your starting equipment, the game gets a bit more fun, but only because it's less unfair at that point.  The items I've experienced do little to offer up a real change in gameplay, but again, you can't and typically don't expect much depth from a $5 game.So at $5 it's worth a couple of hours of your time if you absolutely need to kill time and are bored.

I may update this review later.\This game is good, and is a throwback to the days of msdos based fps games, but there is another game (which I will not name here out of respect for the devs) which is much more polished, immersive, and replayable than this one.I wouldn't say, that it's a bad game, but the fact that it's almost exactly like another game on the market with quite a bit less content kinda irks me a bit.As for the gameplay itself, it's good and polished. The variety of enemies keeps you on your feet. The graphics are ""doom/duke nukem-ish"" which is the main reason that I bought it.It's not a bad game, and if you enjoy the msdos graphics, then you will more than likely enjoy this game for a few hours. At $5, it's a good buy.I recommend, but will only give 7/10 until the devs add more content and immersion activities/elementsSuggestions for the DevsMore itemsIn my time of play, the only items that I encountered were staff crystals, weapon upgrades (new weapons), and artifacts. Giving the player more items and sidequests to collect those items would distract them from the repetitiveness that comes with any type of first person game.Shop System?I haven't managed to pass the first dungeon, so for all I know there could be a shop, but it would be nice to be able to buy/sell item along with actually seeing a portion of the items that the game has to offer.Story?While I know this is a dungeon crawler with a limited story line, it would be nice to have some type of motivation for delving through infinite dungeons"

However, it just wasn't fun. Maybe I didn't give it enough time, but it didn't feel like it warranted anymore of my time. I almost feel bad because it's almost hard to point out what was wrong with the first level.. I think it was just lacking depth? Merely shooting enemies isn't enough to be fun when it feels like there is no strategy to it. First refund I've requested, bored out of my mind playing it."

I didn't expect greatness, but after playing a bit I realised that the game had so much potential.
