I read dev's post ""Please read before buy"" and i said ok i get it, the game is under development and it is nowhere near complete. But this isn't even playable right now, It is just a white background with some pictures and very very few buttons and full of bugs. I started a new game in 1 January and it said next game 11 January, i pressed the continue button until February and nothing happen, it still says next game 11 January. And apart from that there is nothing you can do right now. This shouldn't be in Steam early access, it is clearly way early for this and the devs say buy this game only if you want to support us, which is against Steam rules.Proof that i dont lie:http://i.imgur.com/6lx5dab.pngand i didnt even try to find this bug, it happen at my first time i played it. Imagine how many game breaking bugs there are. Another time i played the game i saved it and next time i pressed load and a loading screen appear, i let it load for 5 minutes and nothing happen."

I'm not going to condemn it as a bad purchase yet since it was $7, but this is the reason I can't stand Early Access.The game, in total, has about 10 screens.  The information you have is minimal. The only real options you have to do are to pick up free agents, edit tactics, which are three sliders, and press continue.  Any sort of stats are minimal to nonexistent.  I played for 10 minutes and literally I found and exhausted everything there was in the game.On a lighter note, I don't want to completely write off this game.  I think it has a lot of potential, it's just cursed with the evil ""early access"" label.  The best description for the game is: wildy incomplete.  Give it a few months before there's any sort of substance to the game.  I want to like it and I will certainly try again, but as of the time I'm writing this, there's virtually no game to speak of."

The developers take pretty much a lot of their ideas from that and put it here ... except they haven't catered it properly here. They even use 80% of the same skills like 'Flair, Vision, Bravery'... LOLBasically this is like me watching Masterchef or some cooking TV show and me trying to replicate all the methods ... to build a sandcastle."

,Not Recommended,415080,24253044,"Posted: 11 July, 2016",all,Varaosa,"ENG:According to the current development of the game at the level of the game is not even worth the early access game. This game could be my first and smallest of the early access game that does not even work.Luckily I had purchased the game -90% discount.I think the best features of this game are just:- The game idea- The game file to a small size- Quick installation- After all, the game is able even to start and shut down- Quickly and easily removedThe worst features of the game are:- Almost everyting else- The game could have developed in some other simpler than the game engine Unity, and therefore I may be a bad  choice to choose the Unity of such a simple game, the game engine.- The game play is almost completely disordered, since most of the content does not even work.- The interface is confusing and difficult to use.- No game sounds or music- Load / Save a game function not working- There is not are any usefull guide or tutorial in this a game- Player can't create or edit AI or set avatars.- Almost invisible to use Interface, which is between difficult to detect buttons.- Possibly a slow game development- Small updates to the game, who do not make significant changes or updates to this game...... And all this is what I said and what is currently only a game, so is it worth 8 euros in early access?I do not believe that, this game play development should not go on for very long, because the game was so simple.In this mode, the game can not be recommended in any case to anyone. Hopefully, the game gets big repairs soon.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------FIN:Tämän hetken pelin kehitys tasolla kyseinen peli ei ole edes early access arvoinen peli. Kyseinen peli saattaa olla minun ensimmäinen ja pienikokoisin early access peli, joka ei edes toimi.Onneksi sain ostettua pelin -90% alennuksesta.Mielestäni parhaat ominaisuudet tässä pelissä ovat vain:- Pelin idea- Pelin tiedosto pieni koko- Nopea asennus- Pelin pystyy sentään edes käynnistämään ja sulkemaan- Nopeasti sekä helpposti poistettavissaPelin huonoimmat ominaisuudet ovat:- Melkein kaikki muu- Pelin olisi voinut kehittää muullakin yksinkertaisemmalla pelimoottorilla kuin Unity ja siksi pidän mahdollisesti huonona valintana valita Unity tälläisen yksinkertaisen pelin peli moottoriksi.- Peli on lähes kokonaan peli kunnoton, koska suurin osa sisällöstä ei edes toimi.- Käyttöliittymä on sekava ja hankala käyttää.- Ei peli ääniä tai musiikkia- Pelin tallentaminen ja lataaminen eivät toimi- Ei sisällä mitään kunnollista opasta tai tutoriaalia- Pelaaja ei pysty muokaamaan vastustajia tai muuttamaan heidän avatareita- Lähes näkymätön käyttö liitymä, josta on välillä vaikea havaita painikkeita.- Mahdollisesti hidas pelin kehitys- Pienet pelin päivitykset, jotka eivät tee merkittäviä muutoksia tai päivityksiä tähän peliin......Ja kaikki tämä mitä mainitsin ja mikä toimii tällä hetkellä vain pelissä niin, onko se 8 euron arvoinen early accessista?En uskoisi että, tämän pelin peli kehitykseen ei pitäisi mennä kovinkaan kauan, koska peli niin yksinkertainen. Tällä tilassa peliä ei voi suositella missään tapauksessa kenellekään.Toivottavasti peli saa pian isoja korjauksia."

Dev has just added a bit more content to it.Added a weird part where you tell your players what to do in a fight? Thats not up to the managers but ok. You can pick/ban heroes. Not interested in that. UI is still messy and as i mentioned, there are bugs. Wait for final release and reviews before buying.No.No.One thousand times.No.At the moment, don't bother. Game needs serious work. Also needs a good translator as the grammar is pretty bad.There's no way to tell if the training sliders work.At the beginning, you would think that you pick a league, and then you can pick a team in that league to manage, that is incorrect. You just pick the team, which has the league in a column to the left of it.Text during a match goes way too fast, and not to mention the fact that there is a slider at the bottom of the match screen that does god knows what?Did I mention the very poor english?You just mindlessly click around trying to figure out what to do since there's no tutorial.Can't tell if training is based on an individual or the team as a whole, since you can select each person on the team but the sliders for training don't change at all.It also seriously needs more countries. The list there is a joke.Wish tab worked as well when inputing text into fields.Refunding and waiting for this game to get out of early access."

,Not Recommended,415080,30089145,Posted: 21 February,all,Chuckmeister85,"Brought this game on a 90% off sale to see if The Tambourine have taken more care of this game than Dream Factory which was their first, expensive, update once and leave game.Cyber Team Manager appears to give more to do than Dream Factory, most of the text isn't in gibberish so you got some sense of what to do although broken english and spelling mistakes (Atack instead of Attack is one example) is a common theme in both games.Updates have been slow to arrive or are non existant with a promised February update failing to materialize.This game is great for giving your mouse clicking finger a workout but other than that there isn't much to write home about, you make a profile, pick a country and team and then it is game on and the quirks and frustrations begin.Overall, Cyber Team Manager is ahead of Dream Factory in terms of completion and I suspect The Legions of Rome is ahead of Cyber Team Manager though it is becoming very clear that unless something is hidden away for later release, all three games have been abandoned.Recommended for those who like their patience tested or want a game for their 'I Survived Playing.....' collection."

,Not Recommended,415080,24209861,"Posted: 9 July, 2016",all,Chon9,"Buy this game at 75% think it cheap, now it discount 90%Current stage of game is unplayable, I am a programmer and I can pretty sure the developer for this game, programming is just one of their hobby, they can't even plan simple flow like to disable ""Continue button"" when match is going on, it is about project planning but not optimization, so i don't expect a reason like it just early access, it is as simple few line of codes will do the job . Not to said more than 70% of the button is unlinked and not functional.I am giving chance of this game as I really like the concept, i belief developers are same too, but i hope you guys can rethink to join in new developers that can help you do better planning and programming so the project could success but not become a dead EA project, as I see the following development flow are related with FPS mode that are not really that important first when your basic core game engine is still full of bugs.Good luck developers."
