Now if only someone would bust some bubbles with me..edit: As a note, if you plan to play multiplayer.. Online Tour Mode is locked which forces both players to finish Tour Mode alone just to play it again together. The only online mode available at the start with is Panic Mode.Kind of a bummer."

Unfortunately the retro aesthetic is ruined by these ""new modern HD sprites"". Kinda like DuckTales! The gameplay is okay though with someslightannoyance.8/10"
,Recommended,415150,30238243,Posted: 28 February,all,Aussiedroid,"Did Pang Adventures burst my nostalgia bubble?I used to be pretty good at the original game back in the day:)At the time it was rather unique, a bit of a twist of Space Invaders with some ricocheting 'bubble' madness that offered a suprisingly good challenge. My friends and I sunk a lot of fun-filled hours into it on my Amiga 500(ahh.. the memories). Fast forward almost 30 years(and a few sequels later)the latest incarnation,Pang Adventureshas set my nostalgia meter running.Core mechanics remain essentially the same as they were, but there are a few more modes, ball effects, weapons & boss fights to spice things up.It does 'kinda' feel as I remember. Sound effects, music & graphics do work well to rekindle that retro feeling & it still has that balancing act between firing your grapple or dodging, & the timing & calculating ahead to pop the bouncing bubbles as efficiently(& as quickly)as you can. A good test of your coordination skills. I can't say it's as engaging or replayable as my childhood remembers though, but there is enough content for a few good hours or more to clock the Tour mode, plus a bit more with multiplayer, Score & Panic modes.Tour mode becomes very challenging(almost puzzle like)in later levels, often pushing you to the last second even after multiple attempts, but my favorite mode would have to be the Panic mode. It cuts out all the'Save the World'story BS & gets you straight into the action in increasingly difficult challenges. The 99 levels are structured in waves, providing an almost constant stream of attack balls to pop.It gets hard!To add to theahempanic, this mode also gets increasingly faster. This works really well, making the game play more fluid & frantic!http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=827876672Score mode is locked behind Tour mode completion, but offers the added hardcore challenge of only three lives. I've try tried to find a multiplayer game on several occasions but have not been success to date. It can be played with friends in local coop though if you want to kick it old school(although I havent tried that myself).So to answer the question, didPang Adventuresburst my nostalgia bubble?No, not at all!It strikes the delicate balance of being close enough to the original concept to be familiar, but also fresh enough bringing a new lick of paint, modes & other enhancements to the table. A quality remake that doesn't compromise the Pang legacy.If you enjoyed reading this review, please followTrue Blue Reviewsfor more recommendations!"

That game and Super Buster Brothers were both released as arcade cabinents games in North America.This game consists of set stages in which you ""pop"" flying bubbles around a small level. This game is quite fun to play, especially if you have a 2p co-op partner (if you can find one that is..). Local Co-op is also found in the game if you have 2 people in your house...The game is quite short if you beat it all the way through. This is not a long game, but it is quite challenging. This game is not easy, but can be conquered easier with 2 players.NOTE: There are issues with 2 controllers for this game..Be aware of this.I recommend this fun arcade game to my friends and others. Have fun playing it!"
,Recommended,415150,22519645,"Posted: 19 April, 2016",all,Floyd,"A refreshing version of Pang.I'm a very big fan of Pang series, I played Pang at the arcades and on my home SNES console and I must admit that, although I was a bit sceptic, that this turned out very good. I really captures the spirit of Pang, the sound and graphics are pretty nice but I came up with flaws that ruined the gaming experience for me.  The smallest baloons are still too big which hinders small manouvers and that ""saved by hairlenght"" factor. Although there are some good levels, the level design might be better. There are very few levels with ladders (as opposed to previous pang iterations) and this is really shame as the level design tends to be a bit boring and unbalanced - you come a cross a very hard level only to be followed by three or four easy levels in a row. The devs included a bunch of weapons that I find a bit overkill and sometimes even useless, on the other hand, dyinamites are used very seldomly. I wish there was a ""retro mode"" which would give you only the basic weapons like one spear, double spear, grapling hook and the minigun.Controls are tight and get the job done although I couldn't get my home-made arcade stick to work as it wasnt' recognized. I think the devs should fix that as soon as possible. I hate to use Joy2key to get the job done and this is, in my honest opinion the biggest flaw. But I think it can be easily fixed in the next update.After all, the game is very fun to play and it offers multiplayer which I sadly did not managed to play as I figured there are still very few players actually playing this game. But adding people to steam friends that own the game gets the job done , as the game supports friend invite.I will give this game a Yes because it's a very unique game  and offers tons of fun , especially in co-op."

I played Adventures for 30 minutes with a nagging feeling that something was wrong, and that was it.Other than that, I've got nothing but praises. Grabbed a controller, gave the second one to my brother who was visiting that day, and suddenly we were kids again back in my old bedroom playing on my Amiga 500.12/10, would nostalgia again."

The dreadful art style and less than optimal gameplay really hurt the fun, especially when coupled with the 'story' segments. I used to love the SNES game I owned, but this one is fit for the dusters."

,Recommended,415150,30237077,Posted: 28 February,all,baja gaijin,"Not a bad game but a kind of weirdly... sluggish? version of the old Pang/Buster Bros. titles. Get a co-op partner or skip it, but I can't call it bad. I'm just not as hot on this as I am on, say, the arcade machine down the road."

,Recommended,415150,23179449,"Posted: 24 May, 2016",all,drawknives,Loved the original PANG! games to bits and this one doesn't disappoint either.One thing I miss: The original sound the balloons made when you hit them. POP!
,Recommended,415150,25317236,"Posted: 2 September, 2016",all,PaperThick,"Pang with a fresh coat of paint, can't go wrong with that.  The game doles out new gameplay mechanics at a regular interval to keep things fresh, which also serves to improve your overall bubble bursting techniques.  Your newfound prowess can then be put to good use grabbing high scores across previous stages.  Very happy to see products like this being developed and strongly encourage anyone else that wants to ride a wave of nostalgia (as long as you aren't a staunch purist) to throw money at this."

,Recommended,415150,23944300,"Posted: 29 June, 2016",all,INTERNETICUS,"The Pang Adventures is remake of one of my favorite games in childhood. I remember I was playing it on arcade machines in early 90s. At first I was sceptical about this Pang Bros adaptation but it turned out the game is really fun and of course catchy as it always was.. Try to play just one ! :) There are new weapons and boss fights. Tried co-up as well and it works great. Some players miss the smallest ballons, but the only thing I miss so far is that recognizable POP! sound when you hit the balloon.. Worth every cent ! Great game !"

With that said it was on offer and after watching a few videos of the gameplay i decided to buy it and im glad i did now. Im all for remakes if they are good and this one is, infact i have more fun playing this than the original arcade version now. If you are 50/50 about this game i would say buy it, its not perfect, but it is boatloads of fun."
,Recommended,415150,30326089,Posted: 4 March,all,Dangerous Beans,"True to the tradition of the series. If you're not familiar with Pang, it's an arcade classic. You can see exactly what the gameplay is about just by watching the promo videos."
