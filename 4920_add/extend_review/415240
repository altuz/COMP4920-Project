When I bought the game it said ""Multiplayer"", but has now been fixed to say ""local co-op"".Here's a first impressions video; review continues below:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rp74hR1ANgThis game plays like a mild-mannered cousin of Agar.io and Sparkle Evolution. You play as a small organism who you move around the screen, eating everything smaller than you and avoiding things bigger than you. You do this until you evolve, and then you do it again as an 'evolved' version of the previous creature. When you evolve, gameplay changes a bit in things like speed, acceleration, and additional abilities like a dash move.The sound is nice and the music fits really well. The graphics are lovely-  simple, but not plain. And that's what you'd want from this sort of title.I'm torn on whether to recommend it or not, as it's only 99 cents and is obviously well made, but I'm really not sure I'll ever play it again. I'm going to say YES."

,Recommended,415240,30582685,Posted: 17 March,all,Polenth,"The basic premise of the game is simple. The tiny feesh has to eat smaller feesh to grow in size, whilst avoiding being eaten by bigger feesh. Some have special skills, such as producing child feesh. Some are more aggressive than the rest, such as the sharks that will track down the player feesh.Arcade mode is the main one I played. After reaching a certain size, the feesh evolves into a different type. My main criticism here is that this doesn't unlock the new type permanently. I'm never going to be good enough to play through all the different creatures in one game, so it'd be nice if I could start with a later creature. That way, I'd have a chance to eventually play all the available types.I liked the way the other feesh are doing the same thing as the player feesh. Sometimes one of those feesh will end up growing very large, as they successfully manage to eat loads of tiny feesh. It creates the feel of a working ecosystem, where the player is no more important than any of the other feesh. Eaten feesh respawn elsewhere, so there will always be other feesh around to continue the game.The art style is fairly minimalistic with a whimsical flair. I'd note there are some flashes of light at times, though it's more of a gradual increase in light rather than a strobe effect.This is the sort of game for playing a round in odd moments. It doesn't have a whole lot of depth, but what it does have is nicely done. It's cute and I enjoyed the feel of the art and the funny descriptions of the feesh."

Make a back round that doest move with you. When you first start out in a evolution its really hard to tell if your moving or not.2.) SAND BOX MODE!!!! When I first used the chill out mode, it relived me of alot of stress! But then i thought... What if there was a mode where it started out blank. and you had the option to add feesh and invormental stuff in it. also change the colors of stuff.3.) add invormental stuff.4.) Add a bunch of cool music to it! well i shoud say add a diferent song with a diferent mood with each evolution.5.) Make it so you can see your mass (not points, mass) and otheres mass so you know if you are big enough to devour their soul or not.5.) online mode, of course!6.) A way to earn money and spend it on health. But you can't use that health in shark mode!7.) If you don't like #6, then i have a solution, bubbles with hearts in the middle. but thats a little bland dont you think? I think there should be somthing else in there, the bubble."

The second stage is the only one that has an ability, every other evo is the same as the first with a different picture (there is one other where you can hold the button down and it kinda sucks closeby things toward you a bit, it doesn't count), you don't even get to play as any of the more interesting creatures that you see.The sharks B-Line right for you as soon as they spawn anywhere on the ""Map"", even on your face, insta-gibbing you and they don't stop spawning, ever.Eventually you evo into a shark and the sharks still go after you.Then...... when you have eaten everything as a shark (since you have cheated with god mode) and you evo, what glorious thing will the ultimate creature evolve into?..... the starting creature.... and you loop from the start over again....

I've played free games that are very minimalist but still fun. At best this is a work in progress.PRO- well done on making a game in such a short period of time.CONS- little replay value- small playable area- chill out mode is pointless- arcade mode progression is not rewarding (you 'evlolve' and have to start again. if you die you start all the way back fromt the start again).Overall no price is right for this game.

I understand having a predator that can eat you and follows you around but dont have 50 of them on 1 level unless its the shark attack mode. Theres no place for that♥♥♥♥♥♥in arcade or multiplayer. You get to the dashing feesh and the screen is so small that you dash right into a shark and theres NOTHING you can do. Its no longer a game about avoiding larger feesh and trying to eat, its a game about if you are lucky enough not to run into one of the 10+ sharks that are forever hunting you. DONT GET THIS GAME IN ITS CURRENT STATE!To the Developer: If you dont plan to reduce the shark number to 2 max at any given point in arcade or multiplayer, then at the very least add an indicator that shows where the sharks are on the edge of the screen. Like a small icon pointing toward them so you dont blindly dash to your death. Both would be great and I would gladly give it another try after that."

The title screen music is horrible. The in-game music however is fairly relaxing.I've given the game a couple tries with friends, and it bugs out every chance it gets. These are not small problems either, they are game stopping. Every game we played we had to restart because the controls would not respond properly, or at all. Player 4 gets booted from the game as soon as it starts. The start menu has no way of exiting, as the exit button doesn't work. Really, it is just not a well made game, save your money.EDIT: I thought I should add that most of these problems occured during multiplayer. Arcade mode seems to have less problems.This game is however severly lacking without multiplayer."

While never having played Agar.io, I understood it was mindless and a time killer.  Seeing this game, I felt this looks like Agar.io with more going on and more of a ""game"" element about it rather than just floating about the screen.That being said, I found that Feesh was worse than Agar.io in that you have sharks and other specific enemies actually hunting you out and being faster than you.In Agar.io, you usually feel it is justified that you have to start all over, as you were either getting to close to enemies much bigger than you, or getting to greedy and moving into dangerous territory.  In Feesh, most times are not justified, as it just turns out the Shark that has been honing in on you the whole game actually caught up finally.The only good thing I found about this game is it makes you appreciate Agar.io as actually being a finely balanced, although mindless game.  You do actually take risks in Agar.io, putting you in danger to get that extra morsel of food, giving it a psychological likeness to many casino games, where balancing risk and reward is the actual skill involved in the game.In summary, if you like this kind of stuff, buy Agar.io rather than this."

Alright I know, it's chillout game but, I got bored after first time I played it, since I got all achivements (2 of them are bugged, didn't get them), Arcade never gets harder a.k.a. after third time trying it was just infinite repeating. None of the achievements were hard, thought so when reading the descriptions ""No-one is ever gonna get this O.O"" and I actually got it at first try. Also, only 9 achievements. This feels way too Early Access- I got excited when it read ""Multiplayer"" after playing too-easy singelplayer. Turned out it was LAN only.For children this would be good game.

Was it worth it? Probablly not. Was it fun? Fairly. Will I do it again? Yup, as soon as I see someone has beat my score. The game is quite entertaining for only $1 so I don't really see the point in not buying it especially if you like the first stage of Spore or like Agar.io. It's not the most revolutionary game out there but it is a fun little time killer. The one downside I have seen? The multiplayer kinda sucks. It starts and someone gets a little bigger than the other player/players and wrecks face then it is over. It only lasts about 1 to 2 min. If that got changed than I would 100% recommend this game for $1. Pick up the game if you want something to do for a little while or to play every now and then. I don't think it will hold you for to long though. If you are looking for a game to play all day this probablly isn't it. I rate it 8/10"
