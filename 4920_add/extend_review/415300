No Multiplayer - Ok i can handle that2. ONLINE SHOP - WHAT?!?!?! It asks you to pay for cards on a SINGLE PLAYER ONLY game! So its either grind out the cards or pay for them! That is too low and greedy. This alone is earning it the Thumbs Down and refund.When they made an effort to remove content by cutting out Multiplayer then they could have made an effort including those packs as a sure drop when battling bosses like normal SP games.I will be downvoted for sure but I just don't like to support any game that has a paywall on a SP only game. If we allow things like this then I fear for the future of OUR gamesJust to clarify - I am NOT saying this as a whole is a bad game. It was actaully good\fun for me with the first few games I tried and I might have continued to play the game and be merry  I am simply pointing out that I dislike making us pay to get cards faster which IMO was due to it having Multiplayer but since they cut out that content I would have expected that the game should have been updated reflecting that change________________________________

76561198081684442,Recommended,415300,30533760,Posted: 15 March,all,Raven,"Okay, I am writing this mainly because I want to address one pressing issue:the hate on the microtransactions. The game is fun, its rather simple, its not a traditional tcg, you get cards out of packs which is nice, you build a deck which is nice, and then the gameplay itself is kind of like a castle defender game, except both sides are sending their troops forward. Its quite nice. From what I can see, there is no pay wall, cards are all avaliable and not even hard to collect. the packs are inexpensive, you can actually sell your duplicates which is a really nice feature, money isn't really that stingy, so yeah, it might take a bit of time to find your SS cards, but its not like it will take months. days maybe, but not months. The story isn't much to write up about, but we get uncensored anime card art that is fairly cute in design. The rub minigame is a bit tedious/a pain, but there is items and work arounds for it so, really its not even something worth complaining about unless you are nit picking. For as long as the game is single player, the microtransactions is basically DLC at your own discretion, and it certainly isn't necessary to gain cards. after 5 hours, I have quite a large selection of cards and no problems beating the computer. Actually, after buying a couple of the ""rare cards"" I can honestly say they aren't very good, the free cards make up the bread and butter of my deck, and while the ""premium"" cards are cool, they aren't really that great for overall strategy. They are strong I guess and make a nice  boss card, but they don't really synergize well when they cost like 10 points to summon"

Yes it's there, and some have gotten it to work, but the important thing to point out is that the cash shop packs can be aquired for 1g in game currency after the main campaign has been completed. Also, voice pack DLC has been included in the game."
76561197974004598,Not Recommended,415300,32830902,Posted: 26 June,all,Iskarius,"Okay so I bought this from a sale, so I didn't lose too much.I can't recommend this game. The gameplay (what there is of it) consists of you playing a subpar card game where you summon creatures using your cards onto a battlefield where your goal is to destroy your enemy's castle before they destroy yours. Its rather dull.The big feature of this game is that you level up your cards by ""rubbing"" them with your mouse (or controller). Originally this was a game for mobile(Turns out it was PS Vita / PSP instead of mobile, handheld device anyway) where this rubbing made more sense. The spots where you are supposed to rub are often in incomprehensible places and you are working under a time limit, making it quite the challenge.This would be alright if you could just try again, but you can't. Every time you want to rub your cards (I can't believe I'm writing all this by the way) it costs currency. This currency is rare and hard to find. You end up having to backtrack and farm the dull card game without progressing in the story for unreasonable periods of time, because your card power matters a lot.I don't usually recommend using cheats, but this time around I don't see any other option. I did some research and apparently you can get infinite resources, allowing you to focus more on the story (if that's what interests you) and less on the combat and rubbing. I wont say how - you can figure that out yourself.The other option is to open your purse and buy the resources with real money. Please don't do this. It isn't worth it. Edit: Apparently you can't buy the resources on PC, but I didn't test this myself.I can't recommend this game. The art on the cards is nice, though."
76561197970861139,Not Recommended,415300,31063576,Posted: 10 April,all,Anrita,"First, the good:This version is uncensored, which importantly respects the artistic integrity of the game.  The art itself is well-done, and pleasant to look at, although not as risque as some players may hope for from an uncensored game with both the ""Sexual Content"" and ""Nudity"" tags.I haven't completed the story, for reasons I'll explain later.  But, I found the portion I did experience to be interesting, although not complex, with some mystery to keep players guessing and a nice variety of characters to keep it fun.The card battle gameplay is simple, but offers a surprising amount of strategic and tactical depth.  Monster girls move and act automatically, except when they're not allowed to.  Careful placement of monster girls can manipulate whether or not they're allowed to move and how well they coordinate their actions, potentially earning you free attacks.  In deck building, you can gain special advantages by including many cards of the same color or monster family, but beyond a certain point, doing so requires including weaker versions of cards (to get around the 3 card limit), offering interesting strategic tradeoffs.Now, the bad:Every problem I have with this game relates to how players improve their card collection.  Aside from a nice variety of monster girls, each monster girl also has multiple versions.  Cards can be transformed into different versions (with more scantily clad artwork), and there are also power tiers on cards indicated by +1, +2, etc.Card transformation occurs through a minigame themed around strengthening bonds through erotic play.  When cards transform, they generally become more powerful, but sometimes they become weaker in some ways as well, making the choice of which version(s) to use more interesting.  However, the minigame is the one place where the fact this is a console port becomes glaringly obvious.  The card image doesn't fit on the screen, and you have to use a gamepad to scroll a cursor, even if you use the mouse to pinch/rub/etc., and the only part of the image that reacts is the face, which is often off-screen.  Basically, the minigame is not fun at all, and just feels like a waste of time, but there is an option to autoplay through it.The bigger problem is the +1/+2 tiered card system.  The +1 cards completely outclass the standard cards, meaning that to continue progressing you have to either grind or pay real money for microtransactions and hope to get higher-tiered cards from booster packs in order to proceed with the story.  This would be understandable in a free-to-play game, but not in a buy-to-play game.  To add insult to injury, once you need to start using higher-tiered cards, any effort you may have spent improving your collection up to that point feels completely wasted.  This ruined the game for me, and is why I must reluctantly give a thumbs-down review."
76561197993763913,Recommended,415300,30521727,Posted: 15 March,all,Holdelta,"Probably the only card game that I've seen that offers this type of gameplay, the only one that really comes close to this is Plants vs Zombies Heroes, but even that's a huge stretch, not to mention for completely different audiences of players.Using a 3 lane system, you put down characters to swarm the other player, taking advantage of the game mechanics and card synergies that come with any card game.Though the game does have a throwaway story, one-dimensional characters, odd typos and other random nonsense that show a lack of polish, the gameplay is more than enough to make up for that, and makes deck building quite fun as a result.If you can also get past the fact that the game has gratuitious fanservice around one of the game mechanics, you can find a diamond in the rough and get quite a few hours of fun from this game.To those who complain about the microtransactions in the game, its barely noticible.  There is exactly one button in the entire game that leads to the shop, and I didn't know its existence until I actively sought it out.  I've mostly played the game with the cards that the campaign provides, and have yet to even spend any of the earned ingame currency to pull cards.Another detail I would like to address is that there is no multiplayer in this game.  I am personally fine with that as there is no shortage of digital multiplayer card games.  The current version of the game is quite relaxing to play as, taking time to decide moves without having to wait for the other side to take their turn.Overall, if you can ignore all the minor flaws, you can find many hours of fun along with a decent execise in deck building."

Then the battles became to difficult.I did buy a few online packs to make things easier but these cards are not replaceable if you reset the story mode and the game data.If these packs were true DLC and saved on a server then it would have a better grade.Microtransactions really bring this game down, especially with no way to restore erased data."
,Recommended,415300,30738846,Posted: 25 March,all,Ally,"OverviewGameplay: 8/10 actually very enjoyable gameplay, reminds me of Plants Vs Zombies/Gwent weird hybridSound: 7/10 nice voice acting, nice sounds, nothing outstandingGraphics: 10/10 for ""science""Story: 1/10, blah blah, magic, blah blah girls, blah blah rub them and they undress to get more mana.Overall: 7/10 Because the fan service aspect detracts from a decent game, but thats just my taste.Full ReviewI bought the game very much blind on a whim after getting a big card game fix from Yugioh and wanting more. I saw Neptune from Hyperdimension NepNep and saw a card game and clicked ""add to cart"". When I started playing it the first thing I noticed was the speed it threw achievements at me, within 10-15 minutes I had around 25% of the games achievements, these quickly dried up.Let me be very clear from the get go, this has a LOT of fan service, includingI♥♥♥♥♥♥you nota mode in which you power up your girls by rubbing their lady garden, honking their hooters and pinching at their bottoms. It's all very surreal and comes out of absolutely no where. I wish I'd researched it more before I bought it as it is totally not my kind of thing, but each to their own I guess!The actual gameplay other than that is solid, 3 lanes to put your cards into which are only battle cards. These cards move forward one space at the end of their turn and attack. There's some cards which can do magic to stop this happening, there are some cards that don't move, some can move opponents backwards. There's a lot of strategy to the movement to be fair. Then there is 3 different kinds of card, attack, buff and healer. These have ""types"" kind of like Pokemon, if you put two types together you can fusion them like Yugioh. It's all actually very entertaining and strategic stuff!The voice acting is good, the music is not distracting and the in game menu sounds are also good(not annoying).The graphics are stellar to be fair, your waifu's will look hawt, your cat eared girls will look like lady cats. The cards actually looks pretty good too. The nudity is there without being full frontal.Overall, I wish there was less fanservice as they actually have made a very enjoyable game, I wish the story was less stereotypical anime story of nonsense but with girls. The plot seems to revolve around girls being touched, talking about touching, being ashamed of boobs and fighting each other. I'd recommend it for the gameplay, I'd say its your GOTY if you like card games, plants Vs zombies, lane attack games and most importantly if you like anime grills."
,Recommended,415300,30528869,Posted: 15 March,all,泥鰍小妹妹,ゲーム内容は皆さんが仰ってるように、確かに凄く面白いです。なので自分は唯一凄く不満に思ったことだけを書きます。まず一つこのゲームのルールでは、よくあるカードゲームのように１、先攻は最初のターンはカードをドローをしない２、デッキからカードがドローができなかったら負けというルールがありますそれなのに３、このカードゲームにはデッキからターンドロー以外の方法でドローしたり、デッキにカードを戻す術が無い１２３より導き出される答えは「後攻は最後のターンまでに相手の拠点(ライフ)を０にできなかったら、どんなに拠点数で勝っていても強制負け」つまり先攻は拠点をある程度攻撃されても、最後まで防戦一方で勝てる。無理に攻めることばかりを考えなくてもいい反面、後攻は相手の拠点を必ず落とさないといけないという、システム的に先攻が有利というか、恐ろしく後攻が不利すぎる内容になっています一応、拠点数を減らすなどのローカルルールである程度はこれを防げますが、デフォの拠点数３で拮抗している試合だとこの展開になることもままあります次に、これが一番の不満点かつ問題点なんですがカード絵柄の拡大表示機能がありませんカードの女の子を大きくエｒ目で見れるのは、1分の時間制限ありのスクラッチのときだけですそれも通常は体の一部分しか見れないほどのドアップになっているので、全体像を大きく見れる時間は十秒にも満たないですギャラリーモードはありますが、画面の左に小さく絵柄が表示されて、それよりも大きく右にカードの説明文が表示されています腋のしわとか、こつえー氏の描くはいてない女の子のお尻の肉線とか、その他もろもろの素晴らしい部分がドアップのときはしっかりと描かれているのが見れるのにギャラリーでは絵自体が小さく表示されるため、それら重要な部分が全然見えないという悲しい事に【よかった点】・シンプルなルールで、ゲーム部分がしっかりしている点・たまにかわいいキャラクターデザインのモンスターカードがある点・「胸キュンスクラッチ」という馬鹿げたギミックが、面白い点・短時間で、1プレイできる手軽さ・追加料金を払わなくても、十分プレイできる点【悪かった点】・だらだらと長いストーリーモード・一部、本当にプロのイラストレーターが描いたの？　と思わせるモンスターカードがある点・モンスターカードの成長が固定である点（胸キュンスクラッチの結果で、カードがランダムに成長した方がよかったです）クリア済み。買うつもりはなかったですが、店舗で売り切れていたことによって逆に購買意欲が掻き立てられ、買ってしまいました。こういっては何ですが、意外と面白いです。ルール自体も簡単ですし、1プレイの時間も短い（10分程度）ので、ついついプレイしていまいます。「胸キュンスクラッチ」自体も、なんだかんだいって楽しいです。こまかく悪い点もなくはないですが、おおむね面白かったので続編がでたら買います今更買ってプレイしたわけですが.このゲームはターン毎に貯まるマナをコストにモンスター娘を召還するのですが、後半のCPUはマナ回復持ち＋高コスト召還のコピペデッキで個性も何もありません。単調でつまらない。またマナ回復に使われるカードがほぼDLCとオンライン対戦でしか手に入らず、こちらは限られたマナで防戦しつつと言う展開になりがちでフラストレーションが溜まります。スクラッチがなかったらつまらなすぎて最後までやらなかったでしょう。結論たたいて、こすって女体を脱がせ、ステータスを強化させるとは・・・コンパイルハートもできるようになったな。こすりが最初から出来ないのはな～～ぜ？ストーリー上の問題ならしょうがもなか。こすりは面白いけど、大音量であそんじゃダメ。警察きた～～～近所のおばちゃんから白い目で見られてる～～て事になりかねないのでね。 4/5とても良い

One day she has to represent her district together with her friends Elza (Master) and Karen (Tactician). They travel to the neighbor district, where Elza is kind of cursed by a mysterious person. So May has to stop this person and rescue Elza...That’s pretty much the whole story. It's not really deep or emotional or meaningful or even thrilling. The game has a light, slightly funny but still enjoyable story and an even better after story (Onsen ;3 ), but basically it's more of a ecchi or fanservice game.Only 4 out of 10GAME CONTENTS AND PRICING7.5	of 10According to the game I played the ""story"" part for about 10.5 hours and for the clean up I needed about 9 hours, which means 19,5h playtime for a price of 20 EUR. Just a buck per hour? That's a better ratio than most of the modern so called AAA titles. This price is more than reasonable for fans of these kind of games or casual gamer who like the setting.Than there is the Deluxe DLC for 10 EUR. It contains 6 Wallpaper, a book with rough sketches, the whole uncut card gallery and the OST. For me the wallpapers are kind of useless and sadly the Opening and Ending are the short versions from the game. It's worth getting, but you should probably wait for a sale of at least 30%. So lets say7.5 out of 10And finally there are the ingame DLC Card Packs. I didn't buy them and I won't take away points for them, butI strongly recommend not to buy a stupid booster pack for 1 EUR each. You won't need them and you can easily get all available cards ingame!GRAPHICS7	of 10Thankfully this Port has full HD (1080p) graphics and not just the original PS Vita graphics. The backgrounds of the Visual Novel part are beautiful landscapes and not too repetitive. All main characters have their own style and appear living not just static. All card motives are also really detailed and sophisticated for every stage of unclothing. You'll get 115 monster girls cards with 3 levels of ""clothing"", so basically 345 different pictures for every taste out there. Sadly the details of the gameplay part are kind of poor. You always play on the same stage and like advertised you only have just one chibi model per type, so one for beasts, one for fairy, one for dragon and so on. It's a nice gimmick that those models loose clothes along the evolution level, but that's about the only positive point in comparison to the VN and Cards. It's asolid 7 out of 10SOUND9	of 10The game has a voiced Opening and Ending (obviously in Japanese!). Both don not break the atmosphere and blend right in. Also all the background music pieces do not feel alienated. A few pieces are also pretty good aligned with the district graphic themes. One or two were even very catchy for me. The sound effects are pretty much forward and - warning - you even get ""aahs"" and ""oohs"" during the rubbing evolution >.<Sadly I don't understand all the Japanese yet but imho the Seiyuu did a pretty good job or at least most German and a few English voice actors did way worst in similar J-games.Overall because of the beautiful composed soundtrack the category deserves a9 out of 10GAMEPLAY (BALANCE)6	of 10First of all also this game has only a ""Partial Controller Support"" you will only see the controller buttons and have to remeber or guess the corresponding keyboard buttons. In the end it's best played with only a mouse.This game is a kind of card game. You have to defend and attack on 3 lanes to destroy the enemy castle at the end. Each turn you get a card and mana. For the cards you have basically 3 types of monsters: Melee, Ranged and Support. Every monster on the field can also be fused one time to strengthen and refresh it. There are no non-monster cards.The game is pretty good balanced. Once you understand the basics you probably never have a hard time to defeat your enemy. There are no difficult settings and the only real rise of difficulty is the rise of the enemy life points (from 1 to 4). Sadly this means you won't find a real challenge. For example I used my deck from PS Vita (only red colored cards (for the bonus), 25 Melee dragons (for fusion), 15 Healer fairies) and I never had a problem and didn't even loose one castle life in almost 90% of the battles. So it should be perfect for casual gamers. Sadly your partner (story wise) is stationary and basically useless.And than of course there is the rubbing system of evolution. Rub and pinch your girl in the right (obvious) places…. Well it's definitely pure fanservice and can be as amusing as annoying. A generic battle system with a unique level system gets a6 out of 10MISCELLANEOUS6.5	of 10The greatest negative point is the missing multiplayer. Without it you simply have no motivation to really play this game beyond the low difficulty of the singleplayer.The game has Trading Cards and Achievements. Also I don't really agree with the badges, the cards themselves are beautiful unique CGs which you wont even find ingame. So it's definitely worth collection at least one set.As for the achievements they are not difficult or really time consuming to get. If you play the game 100% (defeat every enemy and collect every monster girl at least once) you easily get all achievements except for two. Those are the 300 Rubs (cause you only need 230 for all monster girls) and of course the 500 cards (each monster girl has a duplicate with +1, +2 and/or -1). I reached my 100% achievements status after only 19,5h and I wasn't really in a hurry. I'll give it a6.5 out of 10CONCLUSION6.67	of 10The result is 6.67 out of 10 so I definitely recommend this game. If you like monster girls, J-games or simply looking at nice painted anime girls this is a game for you. Just don't expect a deep story. It really is more a ecchi/fanservice game, NOT a story game.20€ for this piece of art is definitely worth it and if it ever is on sale I would even say it's a Must-Have!--------------------------------------------PORT(not weighted)	2.5	of 10I actually played the game back in 2015 on PS Vita. It was kind of fun, having to combine the 2 touch panels for the whole ""rub""-mechanic. So with just a computer mouse it felt kind of wrong for me. The Xbox One and Steam Controller were pretty much useless in this regard, because I couldn't even reach the desired ""extreme love"". Except from that it's a solid port: 1080p graphics, no fps problems, no crashes and fully playable without controller. Sadly the whole multiplayer part is missing and still not uncut (Fia lvl4 missing or missable), so it'sonly a 2.5 out of 10"

If you are uncertain if you should buy this game, i hope my review can help you decide.StoryThe story is quite interesting for the beginning at least, after that it kinda lost its way by repeating stuff and too much forced exposition.GameplayYou have 30 to 40 cards in your deck and start with 5 or 6 cards in your hand each match depending on if you start first or second. Each round you get 3 Mana which you can use to play your cards. You can get extra mana by special abilities from your cards or by playing cards of the same ""Aura"" in subsequent turns. You are restricted to play 1 card per turn.After you summon your card it is out of your control.This brings a nice balance of being in and out of control. I found this to be very unique and i didn't see any other card game taking the control of your monsters away after you summon them.The gameplay hooked me the most in this game. It is satisfying, strategic and succeeds being unique.CharactersMost characters were pretty good, like May, Fia and Elza. Then there were the really obnoxious characters, like your teacher or the villain.ArtA lot original and well drawn artworks. Over 50 different illustrators worked on the cards so there are a lot of variations in style and technique.MicrotransactionsPretty useless actually. I bought one for the luls 0.99€. The cards were not particularly stronger and i got them a little later in the game anyway. So you don't need to worry that you miss out on anything by not purchasing these tempting named card packs.

Also sometimes you can forgot to save that you need to replay a few stages because of it.I won't say this game is repetitive because it's a card game anyway.But i still loves the rubbing concept, it's really unique to level up your monster by rubbing their body.Conclusion is, if you're looking for interesting game like Hyperdimension franchise then don't buy this game. If you're looking for a casual game that you can enjoy and relax yourself after a defeat in competitive game or whatever life throws you, then buy this.Rub - rub, Nep - Nep.EDIT :Pro :+ Remappable controls.Con :- You are bound to unleash the skill of the card whenever you summoned them. They should've added an option to trigger the skill or not, because it's a waste of mana.I've been playing more and, the longer you play, the more challenging enemies awaits, there's also a handicap option to on some areas to increase the dificulty, i love this one it makes the battle is more exciting than before."

Each card have atk, hp, mana cost.. there are 3 types of cards being sword (short range), archer (range from 2 to 5 you will know on top left), healers (have mp and after heal the card in from mp reduce until got 0) and buffers (have mp) always increase atk of card in front.Update after finish main story... well is not so grindy ..cause you can buy the multiplayer cards in 1g (maybe mistake.. dont know, but if they change it i will update) and those cards sells like 40gto do simple math and worst case... you buy those packs sell the 3 cards and get no less of 29g (dont see cards that sell for less of 10g) so grind for get money for buy things like keys that cost 45kg.. is not so hard... probably ...is boring opening so many card packs for do that.. better play and get rub points..Im bad writing guides so i will put the base things you need to know here about gameplay---First cards can have skills and for use those skills you need mana, and as you know summon cards need mana too.. so you have to do a little of math for win. Games makes reward for summon 3 cards of same color, actually bonus are so great that i suggest make 2 color decks.. example (red, blue), or yellow blue deck (the one i use for main card+nepunia) the bonus are like this.. second summon of same color is +1 on mana, and 3 time is +3 mana, 1tk,1hp for all cards.Now skills.. there are a lot but you want cards that move at start, that dont move (defense) some damage dealer, there are cards that give you mana they are good but not so neccesary if you plan all well. cards will always use their skills if there is mana for that and the number of mana used are on bottom left. So if a card say skills 3.. and you have 1 of mana after summon card then card will not use skill.. keep in mind the order of cards you will summon, you will try summon cards that can't use their skills for get mana at start.. later you will not worry about that much.The cards that dont move are you defense, cause the third bonus they will have too  much hp to ever worry about lose by castle down (really a card that started with 1atk 2 hp at start game .. in middle game could have 4 atk 6hp... and on range 3.. boom will kill all), so all left to worry is mana.. you will depend of bonus to build your mana summon.. keep a lot of 3 cards some 2mana.. and few 4--6 mana.. and always pass if you can't make a 3 summon in a row..When you pass, first you dont lose cards.. that is all your hand cards are there.. second you will win 3 more mana.. with 2 3 mana cards +4 mana cards are usually summonable in a row.. only check that second you use dont have +1skill. if you can't put a second card +3 and keep 1 mana for third turn (you will know that) just pass.Until know i had lost 3 times... first at start cause didn't know all this.. second time by turns.. cause game is lost if you have less cards that opponent keep always 40 cards. take castles are sometimes hard.. defense is more easy that attack. my last lose until know was on a special boss that without much to say.. was a game desing for you to lose.. still on that game i kinda last until half game.Now keep in mind that let game take 1 caslte point is better than try to destroy 1 overpowered card.. if you see a card that you can't defeat with 3 summons and will destroy all you summon just let go to castle.. the card will disapear and you will not lose 3 valuable cards.. the only exception is when you lose with that castle point."

You can defeat vastly superior decks using smart play.Difficulty balance is about right.  I did not need to do any backtracking or replaying stages to finish the game.Bad:The infamous massage mini-game is tedious and boring.  I spent several hours doing nothing but running my mouse in circles to power up.Enemy A.I. can be bad at times.  It rarely takes advantage of combos or aligning cards to maximize their strength.

,Recommended,415300,30606724,Posted: 18 March,all,koriontos,"If there were a ""meh"" review this would be the time to use it. Let me break it down:*Play this game if...*If you’re looking for fanservice you’ve come to the right place. This game is ripe with anime girls in provocative positions. As you progress you get to ""interact"" with your team via minigame, with a reward of an article of clothing removed. The girls never get completely nude but nothing is left to the imagination believe me.  As for main gameplay, it’s a fairly simple game. The later levels can be a challenge but generally anyone with any strategy game experience should breeze through this one.*Don’t play this game if...*If you want an engaging story with vivid characters then definitely steer clear. This game wasn’t designed to… well... be a game. Its fanservice that you can interact with. The “world” is akin to the Mario World dots and lines over map with no deviation for exploration. The gameplay is basic, and while I did loose from time to time I would not consider it challenging. For anyone whose played card games like Magic or Yu-Gi-Oh then the pain of never getting a decent card in your hand might bring about some flashbacks. Also as many of the other reviews have stated, there is no multiplayer so unless you like playing with yourself…. Oh sorry… BY yourself, then probably not a game you would enjoy.*Bottom line…*I had fun while playing, which is what I want when I play a game, so that’s why it gets the recommend. The cards artwork is pretty and you can tell the artists generally gave each character their all. The music gets a little repetitive but that’s nothing sliding some volume controls down and running something in the background won’t fix. I didn’t consider this a complete waste of time and would like to see something similar again in the future, though with considerably more effort on the part of the devs. I’m a longtime fan of the Hyperdimension series so that was a huge motivator in my purchasing. This game is for a niche audience so if you aren’t into anime girls it’s probably not for you.As a side note, a lot of people are complaining about microtransactions. While the game definitely makes you want to purchase some strong cards and rub points just to progress faster, it’s absolutely not necessary. Some old-fashioned grinding and you’ll get there eventually."

Some cards are best fielded at level 1 and then upgraded in battle through fusion with duplicates of higher levels. Some other cards should be straight used at max level. Some cards are best used in a pinch for their one time bonus while others will be the meat of your frontline.And speaking of meat it doesn't hurt that it's full of eye candy.Well optimized and runs without an itch, the story is simple but pleasantly not cringe worthy so far contrary to what often comes with the anime genre.Artworks are a bit inconsistent but on the good quality side in general.The soundtrack is surprisingly nice too, nothing to write home about but good.Cash shop is 100% optional, i.e for whales with extra money they don't care about spending if ever they wish to unlock rare cards immediately as opposed to get them while playing naturally. And then again at 1 buck a booster, that's as tiny as whales can be. Don't be that player who whines just because.A good suprise overall, had my eyes on this for a while waiting for PC port, and at this price it's absolutely worth it. Just don't do micro transactions if you don't want to, you don't need it, i for one won't use it, although i like my share of grind in games like these, so if you hate grinding maybe think about it twice."
,Recommended,415300,30521443,Posted: 15 March,all,Lolichu,"We all know why we're here. A card game with ecchi cards, and this doesn't fail to deliver. It has a somewhat simple combat system, but with a few mechanics that can result in some interesting deckbuilding strategies, especially since you can have 3 of each type of monster at each evolution of it (so you can have a 3 goblins and 3 goblins evo 2 in your deck).Speaking of evolution, it's probably the most bizarre part of the game. It'll be fun the first few times, but I recommend getting an auto clicker that you can toggle on and off like, Autohotkey, so you can save time since you'll be doing lots of evolving for... science reasons.As a final note, I've noticed a lot of focus in the review section on the online shop. While I do understand it's a poor choice to add into games like this (I'm very anti-micro transaction and never intend to spend a dollar more on this game), it doesn't bother me anymore than any DLC would. Typically, they both fulfill the same purpose, and yes, there are plenty of single player games with single player focused DLC that does not expand content. That aside, the online shop isn't even upsold or highlighted in any way. You could play for hours like I did without even doing the normal gold summoning, so I've yet to feel any impact from not paying more than the asking price of the game. To shun the game simply because it has one button in it that you can choose to ignore seems to be more shallow than the premise of the game itself.tl;drFun ecchi card game for the price. I also suggest you don't focus so much on the shop online button that's easily ignored by not looking intently at it. Save your intent looks for the anime ladies."

The storytelling element was very poor, very generic - no attachment to any of the characters. Then problem with the game, it does not do simple things well."
