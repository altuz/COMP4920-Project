,Recommended,415350,21541506,"Posted: 28 February, 2016",all,mr.xerves,"It's like Space Invaders mixed with The Binding Of Isaac ... With (outdated) memes instead of religious references. Memes aside, it is a pretty fun idk ... ""Rogue-Like Shoot Em Up"" I guess. Challenging enough, only thing I would add is maybe♥♥♥♥♥♥to unlock or maybe give the cards you collect (in game, not the steam cards) give a bonus or some bbuff .... maybe. Anyway, good game ... Cheers!?"

76561197984194815,Recommended,415350,24401448,"Posted: 18 July, 2016",all,nonb3ing,"A nice little time-waster.Yes, some of the humor is cheesy and it gets repetitive soon, yet I often find myself going back for a few mins of fun with this simple shooter with bad memes. Perhaps it's the powerups that I still haven't unlocked and I'm curious. Perhaps it's just nice to figuratively pound `Justin Belieber` in the face.Would have preferred to give a sideways-thumb if Steam had one, but I got this game on sale can recommend it to shmup fans if they get it at a discount."

,Not Recommended,415350,20623226,"Posted: 19 January, 2016",all,Pirate Software,"This game is colorful, fast-paced, and fun.However, my gameplay experienced was really diminished by the amount of screenwide  obscuring effects and constant heavy screenshake.Most of the time I avoided using otherwise cool powers simply because they covered the entire screen making it nearly impossible to see/dodge enemy bullets.The constant screenshake in the later levels only added to this."

,Recommended,415350,20658014,"Posted: 21 January, 2016",all,Menin Gate,"This is a great SHUMP, not impossible to play, but difficult enough to make you say, 'just another go..!' while screaming expletives at the screen when you get hit with a x499 combo.Lots of humurous characters and power ups: including Chuck Norris shooting what appears to be a laser out of his♥♥♥♥♥10/10"
76561198042693896,Not Recommended,415350,23005034,"Posted: 15 May, 2016",all,Nintendon't,"Feels like playing Space Invaders and Galaga but offers 3 different ways to control your character; KB, mouse and controller. Game is repetitive and becomes old quickly. Needs different and better backgrounds and enemy variety in general but particularly the boses, as it stands it should be .99 cents and for the smartphone market and not PC. I am hoping the developer comes back and improves this game."

It has simple controls to allow this game to be for everyone, whilst also having a great sense of 'celebrity meme' humour to keep you lauging. If meme's, celebrities and retro-style gaming is your thing, then I definitely recommend you check this out.  If not, then I'm pretty sure 'Shia la Beef' will have something to say to you about that.Sidenote: Became perhaps a little too excited when I was shooting at 'Grump Arin'"

,Recommended,415350,34585459,Posted: 29 August,all,Listoric,"The first two tries I wasn't too impressed. Nice memes but repetitive gameplay. Yet the moment I tackled the daily challenge of just being the best today, it actually got me hooked. It's surprisingly really fun and the difficulty and mayhem increase drastically. For 90% discount (0,49€) it's literally a no-brainer. Go get it!"
,Recommended,415350,35073997,Posted: 19 September,all,OperatorWay,"Shooting Stars! is a light-hearted, competent, & fun little pick-up-&-play single-player shoot-em-up with only 3 control inputs: move, shoot, & super-weapon. Thankfully, it lets you hold down the shoot button for auto-fire, otherwise it would be a finger-cramping nightmare to keep mashing it.I was able to control the game using either my keyboard, or mouse, or my wired/USB Xbox One gamepad. The game appears to be locked at 45 frames-per-second on my PC, which is more than enough for its simple pixel graphics, and it keeps hardware temperatures cool. It has built-in options to run the game full-screen or in windowed mode, and at different resolutions.I bought this game on sale at 90%-off for only 49 cents (US), which is a nice bargain for a game that offers leaderboards, achievements, and trading cards. The game works fine for me: I have not experienced any major game-breaking issues/bugs or crashes/freezes. It might not have much replay value, but it's a well-put-together mini-game."
