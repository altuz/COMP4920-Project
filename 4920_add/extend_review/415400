,Recommended,415400,19138142,"Posted: 17 November, 2015",all,Suboptimal,"Summary:The game is a competent and typical of its genre. It runs fine, and it's essentially exactly what you'd expect.Progress Disclosure:I finished the first two dozen boards, which is the first three levels. I reviewed it so early because there were no other reviews; its window of new release exposure was closing, and it didn't deserve to miss sales on account of consumer uncertainty.Observations:The ""tutorial"" consisted solely of a box of text; it was still sufficient, even having heard and read nothing about the game except the store description before playing.The difficulty is fine so far; the first 6 boards averaged under 2 minutes each, and the next 18 took a bit over 4 minutes each.The presentation is simple and functional. The art style is essentially all displayed in the marketing screenshots accurately.The achievements look to be quite doable, so this game would probably be good for 100%ers. All of them are for simple completion; none can be missed, are timed, or even require perfect input.There are no hidden in-game purchases.Accessibility:The game never has time pressure. The interface requires enough precision to hit boxes of the size in the marketing screenshots without hitting the adjacent ones; it does not require dragging. The interface is fully mouse-driven. (It may support touch screens, but I don't have one.) There are no vital sounds. There is no dialogue written or spoken.Locked tiles are distinguished from unlocked tiles purely by color; that mechanic is optional, though helpful for remembering which numbers you're confident in. Some tiles are locked in the marketing screenshots, so you can check before purchasing if there's an issue for you.As a non-expert, I see no other problems."

Each square has a list of candidate numbers from which you can pick, and the objective is to force each row and each column to contain exactly one of each number.Unlike sudoku, this puzzle format allows for more interesting thinking right from the beginning, because Cross Set does not necessarily need any of the squares to be fixed (though they can be). This shaves off some of the early ""fill in the obvious"" steps common to many sudoku puzzles. Unfortunately, limiting the choices by square appears to make the later ""finish filling stuff in"" phase come earlier. I find the puzzle format fresh enough to hold my interest.THE SOFTWARE:The software is very basic. Window size (and Windowed/Fullscreen) are options before the game boots, but there is no volume slider (only a mute button). Oddly, the fixed puzzle squares do not begin locked, even though all of the advertising shows them as locked. Hopefully this is some kind of oversight, as manually locking them just wastes about 10-15 seconds per puzzle.OVERALL:It's an interesting new puzzle format with 64 puzzles included for $3. I've spent about as much per puzzle for Kakuro and Sudoku books, so I'd say the game is more than worth the price if you're at all interested in logic puzzles."

The tweak is that the available digits for each cell are limited and displayed. Your job is thus to cycle through the digits in the cells, use logic and right-click the cells you're sure you've solved until you've completed the level.ProsTweak on sudoku making it fresh againGood difficulty curve through levelsDecent amount of content for the price, especially when factoring in the bonus levelsConsColor scheme and contrasted background might hurt your eyes (they sure made my vision blurry)Some levels are exceptionally difficult and a bit frustratingMissed opportunity for an easier mode where the game would warn you when you make mistakesVerdictIf you're a sudoku or a puzzle game addict, Cross Set will probably be worth your while, especially on sale.

If you do, you might.For me, the beginning was okay but the larger the puzzles got, the more it felt like a chore. The game doesn't require a lot of logical thinking, mainly you have to scan lots of numbers for the next piece you can ""fix"". Solving a puzzle isn't as satisfying as e.g. in Hexcells."
,Recommended,415400,21870939,"Posted: 16 March, 2016",all,Twistor,"TL;DR: Puzzle game with mechanics similar toSudoku.Like Sudoku but differentCross Setis a simple puzzle game that has been compared toSudokua number of times. Basically it presents a square grid of boxes, each containing a set of digits. Your task is to choose a single digit for each box so that no digit is repeated on a given column or row. Just like in aSudoku.Unlike inSudoku, the grid size is variable up to 9x9 and it is not divided into separately managed squares. Instead, the puzzle is constrained by the digits allowed in each box.Many of the same techniques as inSudokuwork inCross Set. You can (almost) always systematically go through the whole grid to find the solution or at least lock in a couple of digits.Difficulty goes from simple (early levels) to challenging and time consuming (later levels) to nigh impossible (optional bonus levels). There are seven main sets (each with eight puzzles), one ultimate set with just one puzzle (set number 8) and two bonus sets each with eight puzzles.Curiously the difficulty is jumpy in each set because of the varying size of the grid. A set of eight puzzles always begins with a small grid but the puzzles get bigger until the halfway point of the set (puzzle number 5) where they start small again. I found it convenient to play through four puzzles of increasing size in a row and then take a break after the last, more difficult one.No drawing on the screen, kids!Interface looks clear and works splendidly. Left-clicking on a box will switch through the chosen digits and right-clicking will lock a digit to its place (or alternatively unlock it). Only three things I would have liked as improvements:First, I would have liked a way to mark a box with a different colour for testing a certain digit (e.g. to find a contradiction elsewhere). Second, sometimes a digit eliminates another in the grid and I would have liked a way to mark these numbers as eliminated so I wouldn't accidentally choose them. This would also aid in finding correct digits.The worst oversight is the lack of saving feature within a puzzle. One can get around it by screenshotting before quitting but it's still cumbersome compared to proper save files. Good thing that all but the most challenging puzzles are short and can be done in half an hour at most.ConclusionCompleting all the main puzzles (and therefore 100% achievements) was a task of almost 10 hours for me. Some of the puzzles were very challenging but none were unfair.I also tried a couple of the bonus levels. Admittedly they are meant to offer extra challenge after beating the rest of the game. However, for these puzzles the simple systematic approach doesn't lend many freebies and one would probably need a lot of the so-called advanced techniques to solve them.Regrettably I finally gave up after beating just a couple of the plus puzzles and none of the double-plus superhuman problems. They will probably always remain there mocking me and my inferior intellect.The present price (3 € here) would be good even for half the content. I'd recommendCross Setespecially for fans of casual puzzle games or alternatively as a light snack to play between more hardcore games."

Then you need to restart.Conclusion: The concept sounded like fun, but the creators did nothing with it and the game is currently in a buggy/boring state so I can't recommend this to anyone as it is now."

,Recommended,415400,30673509,Posted: 22 March,all,Optimist Prime (the Gray),"A decent puzzle game that is similar in style to Sudoku, in that you are given a set of numbers and must ensure each row and column contain one of each number. The puzzles vary in size, up to 9x9, but are not as complicated as Sudoku puzzles (those which also require you to complete nine individual boxes of 1-9, in addition to rows and columns).As a simplified Sudoku game, each level is generally quick to solve. With a total of 64 puzzles, it likely won't take more than a few hours to complete the game. But the replay value is the same as any Sudoku or similarly-styled number game.The game allows you to lock in numbers that you're certain are correct, but locking-in numbers isn't required to complete the puzzles. This game could be improved with a couple small QOL features such as the ability to save your progress on a partially-completed level, and the ability to strike-out numbers on individual tiles that you've deemed to be incorrect... but overall I'd say this game is worth the $3 price tag, and very much worth a buy if on sale.Pros:- entertaining puzzle game- works as it is intended with no bugs encountered.- small price tag, and does go on sale (currently 45% Off, as of writing this review- I felt the colors worked well. They are neutral and calming yet still colorful; a good combination for a puzzle game.I wouldn't classify these as cons, but.. as far as puzzle games go, it's not riveting or groundbreaking and there's no wow-factor.All in all, I'd say a solid 8/10."

Greatest part was about thinking how to solve various puzzles, to think my own solving strategies. After finding out my first solving strategy I thought that I would just need to continue doing same thing over and over again, but you know what? No. After a few levels I suddenly got very different puzzles from what I was solving at first and I needed to rethink my solving strategies, which have bringed some more fun. I still have quite some levels to do so I can't wait to see what challenges other levels will bring."

Kind of boring and really repetitive, especially because the difficulty doesn't vary much, but if you really love Sudoku you might like this too.I wasn't expecting much, but there was one serious flaw that turned this from a mediocre puzzle game to a truly frustrating exercise. There is NO WAY to mark that you have eliminated a number as a possibility in a given square. You can only mark that a square is 'locked' to a particular number. This means that you end up having to reexamine the same numbers in the same squares over and over to eliminate possibilites that you already eliminated. It mostly just made me want to play a real Sudoku game where you can do whatever you want with the pencil marks."
