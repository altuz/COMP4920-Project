Unless you're fifteen and love listening to dank memes on a loop that fades out every 3 minutesThere are way better endless runners out there."

After all, it's only $1 on sale, right?At its core, Nyan Cat: Lost In Space is a slow-paced platformer with mushy controls. It has a ton of customization and several game modes, so if it were satisfying to play, it might be worth a dollar. Unfortunately, it's not. I can't really recommend this for anyone older than 12."
,Recommended,415420,21506650,"Posted: 27 February, 2016",all,Tom,"Nyan Cat: Lost in Space is a platformer released in December 2015, developed by isTom Games Kft. The game focuses on the cute loveable meme , Nyan Cat.Gameplay takes on the role of a very simple but highly addictive platformer. Nyan Cat is constantly moving across the screen and you control when to jump and how far. The aim of the game is to collect as many objects as possible to boost your score and multiplier rating. The game has a very infinite runner vibe to it as there is no actual end on the classic mode.  As you progress through the stages, you will encounter objects which are not always so kind to Nyan Cat, such as bombs, dogs and UFOs which attack you! There are a few other game modes, but none of them come close to being anywhere near as fun as the classic mode.Graphically Nyan Cat is really pleasing on the eye. The cartoon art style and cute animations really do the game justice. Of course it isn’t going to be super realistic visuals or high resolution, because well, it’s Nyan Cat who has been drawn on something like MS Paint. The classic Nyan Cat sound track is played constantly in the background, so if you are easily annoyed by it, you may want to mute the sound, however if you are the sort to be annoyed by it, you probably won’t be the sort to play this game either.This isn’t a really hard game; it just takes a bit of practice to get really good at it. There will be moments where you just get recked by some random event that you had no control over, but that is part of the joy of this game. The game features loads of powerups which help you collect more objects to boost that score, but there are also plenty of downgrades too which will hinder you.There are a couple of different backgrounds and themes to play in, all of which have a neat look which is represented very well. Not to mention there is an editor program that allows you to customize how your Nyan Cat looks, as well as Nyanagotchi, where you are able to look after your Nyan cat by washing him, tickling him etc. You are rewarded with gifts for making your Nyan happy which may be cosmetic items.Nyan Cat is a very casual, pick up and play game, you won’t be able to play it for hours on end, but it is really fun for 15 minutes here and there. Whilst in total I have only played Nyan Cat for just under an hour, it is certainly a game I will keep installed as it always brings a smile to my face when I load it up. If you are really into your endless runner type of games, this is obviously not going to be better than the likes of BitTrip, but it is a really nice little competition in that genre. With the addition of leader boards for friends and globally, it adds a little edge to the game which may be overlooked in others of this type.I didn’t have any technical problems whilst playing. The game can be played either using a controller or mouse and keyboard. Either is fine due to the simplicity of the controls. I personally opt for the mouse option but both works just as good as each other.To sum up, Nyan Cat is your run of the mill OK game. Its part of a genre which already has some really bit names but the low price tag makes this a really good entry level game for the endless runner genre. You of course have to find amusement in the Nyan Cat meme to get anywhere near as much of a smirk from the game though. £1.99 is a great deal and I would recommend you consider it today even just for half an hour of fun.Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

,Recommended,415420,27885371,"Posted: 27 November, 2016",all,Karma,"TL;DR - Wait for the game to be on sale, not a game I would buy full-price as this type of game gets boring quickly & there are cheaper games very similar to this you could get instead.+ Fun+ Easy achievements+ Different game modes+ Customisation+ Missions+ Plenty of unlockables- Only one track for the entire gameIt is a fun game, it is Nyan catThe achievements are not as hard as the stats on the achievement page make them out to be. At most you can get around half of them within 1-2 hours with ease. The stats are low because most who bought the game gave up too quickly or some are still having trouble with achievements syncing up with Steam (I don't have this issue).Even if the game modes don't differ that much from one another there is still enough there to make them different.The most fun I have had with this is actually making my own Nyan cat. You can change its colours, make the face or body totally different so you can make it look like any character you like. You can make and save more than one too so more of your own little characters to play as.To keep you playing there are missions to level up and get more coins, the game happily tells you which modes is for which missions as well so there is a bit of motivation to play more for those seeking it past the achievements. This also helps you get collectables much faster and there is ALOT to unlock.Yes, it is Nyan cat which means the ever so famous theme song is played and only that one is. No variation apart from minor pickups, no remixes, nada. Guess they didn't want to pay anyone for other versions of the song.This makes you want to mute the game fairly quickly even for a Nyan fan. You can change the music but you would have to make your own .ogg file to replace the one in the folder. I would rather mute the game and open a playlist.Yeah, this is my only nitpick with the game. It is simple and that is all it is meant to be. If you was expecting more from this, you clearly did not even look at the trailer. However because of how simple it is, I can see it fading into my library after a week and me barely touching it because of how simple and easily boring it can get. Sorry fans!Would still recommend it though since it is a nice game to play or a quick casual way to pass the time without getting too involved."
,Recommended,415420,22391281,"Posted: 13 April, 2016",all,Kōhe,"People have demonstrated consistently since Fallout 4's release how dangerous expectations can be. To expect great things from the game, and to be disappointed when those expectations are not met, is quite normal. When judgement is rendered solely on the result of those expectations, the fatal mistake is made. It in turn leads to a propensity for jumping to conclusions, and from that point it's a rapid descent into ignorance.Back when Fallout 4 was released, most of the Steam reviews consisted of incoherent, furious ranting that tarnished the whole title after only a few hours worth of gameplay. After being shocked by the overwhelming amount of negativity, I decided to make my own and openly condemned the bad reviews for what they were: baseless and devoid of perspective. It was quite obvious the authors made that fatal mistake, which is unfair to the many developers who put their soul and passion into creating the game.In the end, Fallout fans will almost assuredly find disappointments with Fallout 4, as did I. But if the ignorance of the older reviews and reception of previous games ought to teach one thing, it's that those disappointments are no excuse for blind judgement or jumping to conclusions. If an opinion is to be rendered of this game in the form of review, let it be guided by reason and supported by logic. It is in the pursuit of that fairness and clarity that I chose to write this review.----------------------------------------Fallout 4 is a deeply enjoyable and well-crafted game. However, it definitely has its issues. Bethesda tried new things in this title, some more ambitious than others, and not all of them were successful.It's true that dialogue has been watered down as the devs chose to forgo text conversation choices in favor of a voiced and much more simplified dialogue wheel, which is further hampered by boring choices and weak voice work. Character advancements have been combined into a single perk/SPECIAL sheet. Settlement building, while certainly fun, is mostly aesthetic filler that has little impact on the game world. Side quests far too often amount to just killing some mandatory enemies, particularly with the Minutemen (who are supposed to be the ""good guys"" of this installment), and can become repetitive.My most prominent grievance with Fallout 4 is the dialogue overhaul and removal of the karma system, which was completely unnecessary and not desired by a single player in existence. Unlike the previous flaws, this thoroughly irks me. I realized that this ties in to the primary weakness of Fallout 4: its lack of meaningful dialogue in comparison to most Bethesda titles. Far too often, your dialogue choices are short, shallow, meaningless, or all three.The only choices that have any outcome are blatantly outlined as persuasion options, a lot of which only help you get some extra caps. It's not that you should be making major decisions all the time; the problem is that you, as a speaking character, now have a voice that carries no power. What you decide to say is almost always inconsequential. The dialogue system is highly reminiscent of Mass Effect except watered down; the reason it doesn't work in Fallout is that the two games have totally different approaches to conversation. The previous Fallout games had much better dialogue options because they meant something. Sometimes, your choice of words just made someone hate you, allowed you to entice or inspire others, or developed your reputation through the karma system. Now that karma is gone, your choices are just that much more pointless.The bottom line is that Bethesda sacrificed a tremendous amount of RPG dialogue elements to accommodate full voice-work. While it was an ambitious attempt, it was an all-around mistake and it sticks out like a sore if you're a fan of Bethesda games or RPG's in general. The dialogue wheel system could have worked out just fine, but Bethesda carried it out in the wrong way.----------------------------------------All the aforementioned flaws are some of the most central complaints naysayers have about Fallout 4 and yet not a single one of them has been horrific enough to ruin my experience or let me down. Despite the few bugs I've come across, despite the certain questionable and sometimes idiotic design choices Bethesda made here, this game is still extremely well done. I still feel that incomparable thrill that only Fallout can bring.Even though Fallout 4 falls extremely short on dialogue and all aspects associated with it, it's still an improvement over its predecessors in almost every other way imaginable. The game suffers some graphical issues like muddy textures and poor lighting at times, like any good Bethesda game, but it's still astoundingly beautiful and even breathtaking at times. Movement, melee, gunplay, and physics are better and smoother than they've ever been.People were quick to judge the Commonwealth map based on its size and I was prepared to be disappointed as well, but it's surprisingly the best one Bethesda has whipped up thus far. The suburban locations are more organically dispersed and things become more compressed as you near the cities. Streets are narrow, buildings are tall, and locations are absolutely jam-packed alongside a ton of unmarked ruins and buildings you can enter. There are hardly any copy-pasted environments and they all show great attention to detail.I was also worried that granting access to power armor and a minigun within the first thirty minutes of the game would be a huge balancing issue as well, but it really isn’t. Power armor relies on uncommon fusion cores for power and you’re not an unstoppable god while wearing the suit, especially not at higher difficulties or levels. You can acquire some strong weapons like the minigun or Fatman relatively early but finding sufficient ammo is another matter entirely.----------------------------------------Skyrim was a simplification of the Oblivion formula, but it was still a fantastic game. In much the same way, Fallout 4 is a simplification of the Fallout 3/New Vegas formula and is still extremely good. Even in light of its issues, this game has not been a disappointment at all. RPG elements can be enhanced through the wonderful modding community and will eventually make up for some of the game's weaker points, a perk of the PC version. Bethesda has, however, been on a recent trend of simplifying their games too much and I hope they change course.Truthfully, the negative Steam reviews had me partly worried that I’d be disappointed but I chose to disregard them and arrive at my own opinion. I’ve learned that nearly every point of contention was blown out of context. The few issues that haven’t been redeemed in my eyes still pale in the face of the tremendous work that was done to bring this new and beautiful Fallout world to life. I have no doubt that the naysayers worked up their expectations to heights beyond reason, and it’s therefore no mystery that they hit the ground so hard afterwards. I chose to see Fallout 4 for what it is rather than what I expected or imagined it to be: a lovingly crafted game that, despite being marred by some of its shortcomings, has that same engaging splendor that far supercedes its flaws.I highly recommend you try the game and approach it with a neutral and reasonable demeanor, and you won’t be disappointed.----------------------------------------EDITI'm grateful that so many people have found this review helpful and I'd like to thank you all for commenting. I can't reply to everyone's comments but I've certainly read every one of them.I hope that my review has given you some useful perspective, either good or bad.EDIT #2Reworked the intro to be less confrontational, as it was no longer needed.

Note that I don't have a smartphone (legasp!) so I have no way to compare. Take that how you will.Pros:- Nyan. :3- Make your own nyan cat.- Ok backgrounds and premade skin packs I guess.Cons:- The gameplay for any of the modes about as redundant as the soundtrack. Good for a few minutes but after a while it gets boring/annoying.- Double-jumping is the only thing that seemed to get me anywhere in the original mode, not to mention the lack of control once you're flying.- A better way to see what's above/below you at least in terms of platforms would be great. :/- Getting enough coins to save for permanent upgrades can take ages, especially given the above. Amen for no microtransactions with thisinsanely obviousmobile port."

A fun though repetitive, side-scrolling, platform/jumping game for only 3 dollars which features a lot of different modes and other features.+This game gives you access to a lot for only 3 dollars. There are several modes. You can paint your own nyan cat and there is a tamagotchi styled area where you care for your own nyan cat and more.+Lots of cute and absurd humor.+No bugs.+It's only 3 dollars.+Low system requirements.+Pretty, bright and cute graphics which are completely at odds with what most PC games tend to focus on.+Good sound (particularly impressive nyan cat mewing sounds).+/-If you bother to actually try to figure out the gameplay mechanics this can be a very challenging game. However, the challenge is at such a level of difficulty that the game can potentially become frustrating.+/-Navigating through all the content can be a bit confusing and the game's funny sense of absurd humor can often make things even more confusing.+/-This game never takes itself seriously. In most respects this game exists as a parody of itself. Even so, the game can be fun and challenging until an intense sense of repetition quickly sets in. Good to play it once in a while for a very short time, this game is clearly intended to be an okay, lighthearted cell-phone game.+/-Responsive controls, though really, they had better be responsive since the ""controls"" of this game merely consist of pressing the space bar at certain crucial times and selecting things from menus.-This game has just one piece of music which, in itself is sort of an absurdist joke. You might be able to guess which piece of music it is.-It is often hard to know whether an in-game item is beneficial or harmful to your progress before you grab it.-Severe lack of tactical depth. Items which you acquire during a play session cannot be saved in an inventory for later use, for example.-Playing this game for an extended duration may cause you to enter a quasi-delusional state wherein you may begin to wonder why the entire world is not intimately familiar with Nyan Cat. Playing this game can really can make you feel as if Nyan Cat should be as inexplicably popular as Hello Kitty or something."

Jump to stay on platforms, don't fall or explode, and use power-ups to stay alive and make it a few meters farther. When you get tired of that, you can visit your Nyan Cat and pet him, play with him, dress him up with fun accessories, or rearrange his furniture. The downside is that there's only one song on the soundtrack, and it loops approximately every 30 seconds."

But if you were to compare the prices between the two (if you were to buy into the paid items in the free app) this game is significantly a lot more cheaper. And after taking a look on iTunes (iOS) I've noticed that there's a Lot of in-app purchases same with Android of course. While the game on Steam makes it so you unlock everything. Clearly making it the better version. (Also along with future content perhaps.)"

Sadly I came across this game, I could not pass the opportunity. My brains did not allow me to click off to leave this page. I got this feeling I've never had before.. I had to buy this game. I knew this game would not entertain me for long but I had to get it. I added the game to the cart, after buying the game it took roughly 1minute to download. I hesitated to click ""Play"" but I did. First thing I hear is the theme song coming very loud through my headset to my ears... I try the game for the first time.. I feel stupid for wasting 2,60€ on a game which is pointless in a long run. After a few tries I noticed I am addicted, I needed to get higher and higher on the leaderboard as it would actually matter (it really does not) now sitting at roughly 90th I had to stop playing to save my ears for a while..Ok now for the serious part:Do I recommend? : YES! Even though its quite expensive for a game like this you should get it. Its addicting like CS:GO.Are there any cons?: No :DDYayy release day review :DI rate 11/10."

When I found it on steam,  I was more than genuinely surprised. I bought it during the sale and I'm glad I did. The PC controls are better than I expected, the graphics were nice (excluding the 8bit space background) the permenant bonuses are cheaper thann mobile (a LOT cheaper like holy crap the mobile prices were extreme it took me HOURS to get all off those and here I got them in less than an hour). I personally still like the Nyan Cat theme because I'm a loser, but most people don't so no hard feelings or anything. It was worth the sale price of about a buck fifty. I played this game to unwind on zen mode on mobile and I plan to do the same on the PC version. There's a lot of hate for the game, and a lot of the people have good reason to, this game isn't their style. It is mine though so I'm going to recommend it.Favourite modes: Zen and Universe"

Read that line and think ""Does that sound like it interests me?"" your answer is of course HELL YEAH! Nyan Cat: Lost in Space is a 2D scroller game where you play as the poptart cat, jumping along obsticles to retrieve sweets and goodies. Along the way you'll encounter Alien UFO's, Dinomite and other traps that will enhance your gameplay and make it much harder to fill yourself full of those delicious goodies.

People might say ad things about this game because it's an ""outdated meme"" or something like that, but to break it down here's the good things and bad things:CONS:-Once everything is unlocked (which in all fairness, does take a while) there's no replayability-The annoying music, sounds, and phrases Nyan Cat says-The platforms are randomly generated, making it impossible to survive if you're at the bottom sometimes, which isn't relying on skill but just pure luck-Movement is extremely limitedNow that all the ucky stuff is out of the way, let's get to the good:PROS:-Excellent, relaxing casual game-Custom Skins! (Someone as immature as me is loving this)-You can take care of and dress up your own Nyan!-5 different game modes-Funny and entertaining power-ups-Upgrades that make the game more fun-TAC NAYN MODE!All in all, while this game can be tedious and annoying, it's cute and entertaining and a great casual game.I can say that it is worth it's low and generous price!"
