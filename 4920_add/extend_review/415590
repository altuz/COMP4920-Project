,Not Recommended,415590,31433620,Posted: 29 April,all,Shillz,"Written April 28th, 2017. Game content subject to change.Positives+ Combination of concepts from other games in this genre (Left 4 Dead, Vermintide, Killing floor)+ Unreal Engine 4+ Level design (surprisingly well done!)+ A good price+ Animations (most of them are actually really good!)Neutral= GunplayNothing worth talking about. Guns don't feel impactful right now, but it's not horrible.= GraphicsAgain, nothing worth talking about. Looks like a typical UE4 game. Personally, too cartoony right now. The regular aliens look pretty generic.Negatives-Developer attitudeNot even joking. A devs response to not having a FoV slider isI get ill, too, if I play too long. It helps if I walk instead of sprinting but nothing prevents nausea fully except taking breaks periodically. Which, you know, helps w/ game/life balance in case that's a think you worry about. ;)Source:steamcommunity.com/app/415590/discussions/0/1319961618827936186/Also,For me personally, I'm still sad that Katamari Damacy made me so constantly nauseous, but unfortunately in that case, it was just a downside to that particular type of game and couldn't be fixed.So what are you implying here? To deal with it?-No FoV slider in a PC gameAs of a recent patch, an FoV slider is in the game.-Overall sound designThe game is still early in development, audio is a late aspect of development in video games, being one of the last things added and then changed via feedback. Right now it's missing a lot of sounds, which is normal. As of now, though, it's nothing special. Guns sound unimpactful, aliens don't make a lot of noise, and the big one...The voice acting.It's just downright bad. The dialogue itself is fine, but the delivery is not. It's not serious at all; it sounds comedic and flat. When you look at Left 4 Dead, the dialogue was grim. There was desperation in their words, fear. Not so in Earthfall, bar some of the voice lines. Whether it's an inexperience in voice acting or not being given enough direction on how to voice it by the devs, who knows.There's also an obscene amount of pop culture referrences in the dialogue. They're fine in moderation, but Earthfall has way too damn many. It's extremely cheesy.When a user commented on how bad the voices are, this was a developers response.I generally play a game based more on how fun it is and turn down sounds I don't need. But I understand everyone has their priorities.Source:http://steamcommunity.com/app/415590/discussions/2/1319962244123254011/So by saying this,you're saying that it doesn't matter if it's bad, just turn it off.As for the music, it's alright. Needs more intensity if they want to keep this genre of music, honestly, but it's not bad.-The Enemies and their AIBasic enemies will just run towards you, pause when they get next to you, then attack, so it's easy to exploit this. Special enemies all just bumrush you with no thought to when they should strike, unlike in Left 4 Dead where the Special Infected will wait for a suitable moment.The AI director, if there is one, is improperly balanced. At the start of a match on normal you will likely be bombarded by a horde and all Special Aliens, bar the Beast, at once.|Conclusion|As of April 28th, I do not recommend buying Earthfall. It's an Early Access game, and everything in it is subject to change.But there's one thing that won't, and that's the attitudes of the developers. Given what they've already said, and how the game is only $15, the impression that they just don't give a damn is apparent. I can easily see this being abandoned by the developers, or at least not given the attention it needs.When you make excuses on not having an FoV slider (which is easy to add in UE4), and just telling someone to turn off voiceovers if you think it's bad (which everyone does), you know they just don't give a ♥♥♥♥."

Looks good, runs great.The AI of your team is kind of ""simple"" but this is a game meant to play with friends anyway.Only 1 chapter at the moment but it's pretty fun.Worth.(Real review to come after more play time.)"
,Recommended,415590,31384060,Posted: 26 April,all,A-A-Ron,"EDIT: Game is MehOverall I think this game is great. I first played this game at PAX West 2016 I had loads of fun remembering all my old strategies from L4D. There is a lot of potential for what Earthfall can become. Earthfall takes the spirit from the L4D franchise and puts their own twist on the game making it as fun as L4D but new enough so it’s not an exact clone. This game isn’t perfect by any means but it’s a brand-new game from a small-time developer so there’s always will be room for improvement. One of the most important thing I’ve seen from Holospark is THEY TALK AND LISTEN TO THE COMMUNITY. They are actively searching wanting everyone’s help in finding bugs and making improvements that we want to see.Pros:-Servers work great when playing with friends-Mechanics work well-I haven’t had any major drops in performance-Art style is awesome-A variety of weapons (rifles, shotguns, melee, etc.)-Variety of level design (not all start here go here like L4D)-Great atmosphere-(Solo) AI are accurate and somewhat reliable when it comes to shooting-The starting pistol is a formidable weaponCons:-Weapons have little to no recoil (Example: Pin-point accurate akimbo Desert Eagles)-AI get stuck on random things and won’t/can’t move- AI will walk in front of you when you are shooting-The voices for characters are subpar and kind of annoying-Limited random phrases from characters-Weapon shots have delayed sounds at times or no sound at all-The Berg 930 shotgun blocks your screen when you reload so you can see what’s in front of you-The Combat CVS rifle sounds like a BB gun-Game is very difficult at times even on regular-AI likes to heal you at improper times (healing you instead of shooting the Beast that’s 5 feet from us)-Long loading screens (Dev's are aware and are rying to fix it)-Hitting pause doesnt pause the game-No kick option for multiplayer (In game)"

,Recommended,415590,31513727,Posted: 2 May,all,DoktorUnsinn,-This is a game set in the pacific northwest (woo!) where you play as 4 survivors fighting through hordes of aliens to progress through the map and complete objectives. A very L4D/Vermintide-esque game that I find very enjoyable as it is now granted it is certainly an Early Access title.-If you are not an avid fan of L4D style games you may want to wait until the game is further along in development. If you do enjoy L4D games and do not mind the EA model then I think you will enjoy this game and the price is very reasonable.-Workshop is not currently available but will be implemented at a later date.-The developers are quite active and friendly in the discussion threads.
,Recommended,415590,31512649,Posted: 2 May,all,Redhotjets,"Awesome game! Similar to Vermintide and Left 4 Dead, it is a 4 player coop shooter full of objectives to go through and complete and 4 missions at the moment (more coming for free). Futuristic setting in North America, has unique elements like 3D printing guns, mobile mounted gun turrets and barriers you can use for serious building defense which can be setup almost anywhere, and a fun tonne of aliens including specials that pin you to the ground, pull you away, explode gas on you etc. Once optimised and the other 4 missions get added it will be a cracker of a game, especially once workshop gets added (it will be a while though). Devs are fully engaged with the community also."

,Recommended,415590,34260589,Posted: 15 August,all,jphoen1x,"Game is really fun even in EA. Reminds me a lot of L4D & L4D2, and is one reason I like it. Very good ideas, my only real complaint is the AI and the low player base. Not many people playing this atm leaves you to play with the AI teammates who literally bullocks it all up for you by standing in doorways holding open your barricades, standing in front of your downed body and not picking you up or a downed teammate. Hope the AI gets better as the kinks get worked out, but all in all I really enjoy and recommend this to any Left 4 Dead fans.ONLY Other things I feel need tweaked before leaving EA:1. SFX - A lot of SFX are either off their mark (reloading certain weapons sfx not starting when it should) or some sfx are just not there, or low quality (but it is EA so kinda expected) Being a professional Sound Designer/Audio Engineer these are minor issues but ones that pick at me every time they occur.2. BIGGEST tweak I see needed is the Melee combat, very clunky and not fluid, most of my melees tend to not even make contact when in any other game someone would of just lost a head. Hoping to see that get worked out so I can stop using Dual pistols.3. Not sure if it is part of the game, but many times i put up barricades, I will go to another area and come back to say 1 or 2 of them gone, jut disappeared with no one attacking them to brake them. So my once secured hold out room now is useless.Those 3 minor things aside, this game even in current state is ready to play and very fun. Hope more people pick this up so I can stop playing with lame AI that get me killed too often."
,Recommended,415590,32914807,Posted: 27 June,all,o|-} Elastikspastik,"I have been waiting for another game like this for a while. It is a lot of fun blasting aliens. It is like Left 4 Daed but with aliens. 4 Survivors fight from point A to point B and/or doing objectives inbetween. This game has so much potential and I cannot wait for it to be updated more.You got the generic like alien, also special aliens that have abilities (like L4D), and also a tank like alien. But just as fun as L4D. If the devs do this game right it can be a big hit.Though it is only just recently released, it does need some optimisation and better AI. Your AI teammates will run in front of you a lot when shooting but it is not game breaking, just a little annoying. I have to play with settings on low but it still looks good.I have posted a video below so you can get a betterlook at the actual gameplay (and settings on low). I have yet to play it with friends on higher difficulties which will make it all the more frantic.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Naxp_pUeLbc"

,Recommended,415590,31990581,Posted: 27 May,all,CDPlaya,"This game is very fun. I have heard it described as ""Left 4 Dead with Aliens"" by a YouTube Let's Player. I have to say that I agree. This game can be played solo, and I do play it solo from time to time, but to get the most out of this game, you really should delve into the co-op multiplayer. You can team up with up to 3 other friends and tackle the game. Not many people host open games on the servers however, so I recommend having a few friends to play it with in advance. I can't say this is a huge negative as this is the fault of the community, not the developers. It is also a fault that many such games suffer from. So, that element is not taken into account on my recommendation of this game. If you are a fan of first person shooters that will keep you on your toes. Then this game is worth a try."
,Recommended,415590,31619731,Posted: 7 May,all,zesparklebomb,"While this game is early access, for now I must say that it is a bit more laggy than expected. The lag is a problem when I'm trying to shoot at the enemy which makes it more harder to kill enemies. Also, (and again I know this IS early access) The graphics arent as appealing. I know the developers are still working on this so I will be patient with this. I enjoy seeing games like these and overall, enjoy the concept of this game and hope others shall enjoy it also."
,Recommended,415590,31384141,Posted: 26 April,all,Mleko,"I must say, this game made a very good impression on me. It offers 4 missions from the first campaign so far and if you ever played games like L4D, Warface or Hounds:The Last Hope, you will most likely enjoy this one, too.There is an alien invasion and you, as a brave citizen, have decided its just not the time to give the earth to the adversary species. And guess what - there are others like you to defend the planet!You have to work as a team to survive, interact with the stuff around to progress. What i like is the fact that the game looks good, it runs smoothly and as for the multiplayer coop, the servers are fairly fast. The AI has some minor bugs as the NPCs might get stuck here and there, but thats just an early access game.The world looks dark and dirty. Its an invasion after all, right? I felt it like a mix of themes from The Last of Us, The Walking Dead(telltale), Warface and probably some others I just can't recall at the moment. The area is mostly wilderness that you have to traverse, bashing through swarms of various enemies. Throughout the game you will encounter new enemies as you progress(or trigger an ambush that you would never expect).Bought this game today and i really enjoyed it as it is for now.Thumbs up!"

,Not Recommended,415590,31385032,Posted: 26 April,all,Equinox Fox,"I've played this a few times at Pax south, and I've been looking forwards to getting my hands on it. Unfortunantly, after a run through the campaign, I can't sink my teeth into this. Honestly, the gunplay doesn't feel good, there are no sounds for the guns, the AI is simple and doesn't think about what it does, it simply runs at you. In additon, you can NOT outrun the enemy while sprinting either. There is no chance for you to properly setup, or even really catch a breath.From a gameplay standpoint, this game just isn't ready. The guns don't feel smooth, the enemies don't feel smart, and the game just overall doesn't feel all that great.Edit: I'll keep the original, but I posted this simply after a round with a mate of mine.Alright, let me start first and foremost with a bit of backstory behind the game itself.I'm seeing footage of this from 2016, and I personally played this game at Pax South in 2017. During the day I went, steam was having some issues and I talked quite a bit with the devs about things I'd seen so far, things I feared would have made it into the final game, as well as some suggestions and comments about how it looked thus far. My mate and myself got into our match, unfortunantly only 2 computers were letting us in, so we tackled the game with only the 2 of us, instead of a full team of 4, and it felt. Alright. It preys on the feeling of Left 4 Dead right, but it doesn't offer anything that would capitolize on the forumla of the game and improve it. For 20$ right now, through steam, you can get Left 4 dead, or even the sequel right? So for 30$ you get this game, which is in early access, and has had what I would assume over a year to fix these critical issues.The game does not feel smooth, it doesn't play well, and there is no interesting mechanic in the game to build on the forumla whatsoever. It feels like a beta Left 4 dead, but aliens instead. The hunter is in here, there's a guy that drags you off much like the smoker would, and the tank. Let's not forget boomers either, that explode and leave behind a mess of a cloud. This game COULD be good, and I'd love to come back and play it when it gets there, but nothing about it is worth a 30$ tag at the moment. Nowhere close. Early access is not an excuse to deliver almost the exact same game I played at Pax a few months prior.The game needs major balancing before it could even be considered playable, the aliens have god awful AI that literally just run at you. Do you think you can be safe anywhere? Nope. You cannot outrun the aliens, and you cannot out climb them anywhere. You get no breathers, in a constant ""OH IT IS BROKE NOW DO THIS!"" Kind of game. What could be a simple 3 step system to actually get out of this, or something where you actually get to explore the level, instead turns into doing fetch quests, going back to a ""Base"" where the fortifications you drop die after 3 seconds, and never being able to really get a feel for the world you're building here devs.Overall, I cannot suggest this game for 30$. Maybe 15$, but unless you1. Step up the gun game. The audio is god awful, feels like I'm shooting a pellet gun, and worse, the reaction to a shot gun is they just sorta flop where they were running at me from.2. Balance your damn game.3. Remove the excess of stupid quests that do nothing but keep you running out of ammo and desperatly trying to communicate with your team to move a payload from Overwatch.And anyone that plays that game should know, nobody stays on the payload."

Im a big LFD2 fan and yes this is a clone of it. Is that a bad thing? No. The look and the feel of the game is solid and the game plays well enough. It is rough in some areas but it is early access. I havent tryed multi player yet so I can't comment on that. I mainly play a game like this solo just for fun and I have to say while the AI bots are stupid there not as bad as Vermintide's AI bots and yes that is a bit diffrent from LFD2 and Earthfall. Playing Vermintide solo is alot harder than this. At the 15 price tag it's not bad.I don't think this will be the next LFD2. But I do hope this gets finished and dose well. I would all so like to see this have Steam Workshop support
,Recommended,415590,34050648,Posted: 5 August,all,CyberMage,"Wow, this is what L4D3 should have been if Valve could count that high.  Think of it as L4D but with objectives and aliens.  Very impressive for early access.The gunplay is pretty awesome though low on recoil.  Ammo is at a premium so you will often find yourself falling back to the infinite ammo pistol.  Best fun I've had with a new game in a while.This is NOT just a ""run to the next safe room"" game.  It requires teamwork, situational awareness and resource (i.e. ammo) management."
,Recommended,415590,31518009,Posted: 2 May,all,UncannyValleyForge,"Tl;dr--it's Left 4 Dead with aliens, iron sights and 3D-printed guns.In greater depth, it's pretty fun for this stage of early access--despite the fact that this game cribs so liberally from L4D, I found myself enjoying it. The alien monsters the player faces are entertainingly squishy, and the levels are colorful and well-designed, offering numerous choke points for the players and enemies alike.I do have some gripes, though--weapons feel a little impotent at the moment (the sound design and impact feel are both pretty weak) and there's not a lot to distinguish it from its source. The gun-printing mechanic is interesting, as it works sort of like a COD Zombies-style ""magic box,"" but it's not enough to make the game pop all on its own.But, of course, I'm reviewing this as an early access experience, so there's lots of room to grow in the future--and this is off to a solid start."
,Recommended,415590,31529571,Posted: 3 May,all,RanchSmoothie,"I recommend this game, eventually. I played the game at PAX, they had the first lvl for demo. It was a fun game and (as everyone has said) very reminiscent of the L4D series. The devs voiced at PAX that this was they're goal and I feel they have achieved this. The reason for the ""eventually""... this game has one campaign, 4 lvls. So while it is fun there isn't much game to it at this point. If you want to support the devs go ahead and get it now, play the 4 lvls and put it back on the shelf for a bit. Otherwise just wait until more content is actually out."

Movement is very stilted and sluggish at the moment.  I'm having to run everything on LOW settings.Recoil on the pistols is awful.Title music is okay - nothing particularly exciting.  Ingame sound is also okay - nothing really special there either.A cooperative multi-player team based game is sorely needed - whilst Left 4 Dead 2 is great, something new is really needed for this genre.  With a lot of love, care, affection and continual updates, this game may be The Right One (hell, there is certainly not much competition), but it's certainly not The Right One at the moment.Apparently the game will be in EA for around a year - so it might be worth revisiting this next year.Another improvement needed, is, of course that old favourite : AI - at the moment your fellow teamies seem to be suicidal.  I bet if there was a bridge level, they would all jump off it.The aliens dont seem to have any tactics and just head straight for you.  Perhaps they are sucicidal too.  Perhaps my teamies and the aliens should actually team up and perform a mass sucicide...However, with the (very sensible) reduction in price, it is rather less of a risky gamble now, and as such, can be recommended more - hence now recommending the game - if you are prepared for it's foibles..."

Only thing i can say is, its hard to aim smoothly most of the time Because the game feels choppy, if you know what i mean but like most of what other people say. This game is great and if it does improve a lot it can be one of those games that you can see your self playing for years. If these are the types of games that you like, or are into i say go for it and buy it. If the game does improve  in the future then Might find yourself paying more as the game developes, the orginale price was $29.99 but as you can see it was brought down to $14.99 if you ask me they just Did us a Kindness, more than i can say for most game Developers. If you guys are intrested on the Problems that this game might have check out in the Forums its all there. My biggest problem is the aiming because the game feels Laggy at times and the voices need to be improved, the voices suck hahaha they sound like someone is hitting the repeat button on a recorder."

I will revise my review in a few months to a year when more content comes out. It is important to note however that the game is early access and that content will come. I just dont feel that enough content was provided on launch to immerse the players that made the purchase into playing the game for any lengthly period of time. Keep up the good work Dev Team, This review is not the end!"

,Not Recommended,415590,31930360,Posted: 24 May,all,gamerhoofster-pony,"Earthfall is a god awful reskin (sin-oof or whatever) of Left 4 Dead. Ya it is it's exactly Left 4 Dead, only difference is there are aliens instead of zombies. My first start of the game, the very first level my first thought was ""is this Left 4 Dead?"" I should note that Earthfall is an early access game, not the full game.There are four missions...ya four missions and I don't care if the game is ealry access or not, four missions is weak. I was able to play on regualr diffculty and get to the thrid mission easy. There is suppose to be a chapter 2 or something coming soon but that doesn't excuse the lack of campagin.There are three diffcultys, easy, regular and hard. Like I always say ""You give me choice, I pick the easy choice."" There is nothing wrong with different diffculties. This allows gamers to play at their comfert level but any game should be played in the hardest diffculty.There are four  players to pick from. Two guys and two girls and none has any specail tribute in the game. All character are the same. And playing solo, the player A.I. is around new player level. They don't do anything except kill anything that movies even when you are shooting alien they will kill that alien before you do.The graphics are better then Left 4 Dead but unless you want to experiance lag every minute you have to turn the graphics setting to low.The weapons are not good since there are 9 weapons in the game and 2 or 3 melee weapons. The weapons sounds are more or less the same. All shotguns sound the same, the assalt rilfes sound the same. The ony ones that have different sounds is the pistols, chain gun and flame thrower.The alien verity is also weak maybe 5-6 aliens. There are 4 that are unique, the jumper that will try to eat your face, the tail mouth that has a mouth on a tail, a acid bomb alien and a tank alien.You can barrikad doors by using deplyable metal doors and set up manual turret defeances as well for when hordes of alines come after you.Earthfall gets a 3/10 score. It tries so hard to be like Left 4 Dead but with only four missions and less content for it's release and the current pice just isn't worth it. Wait till the full game release then get the game.Thanks for ready my review."

I get its earl access but that was just not enjoyable even a little. I hope to revisit it in a few months and give it another try"

I really want to copy everything about you.Just Teasing.But in All seriousness, this game has some major issues.It has some of the worst weapon sounds I have ever heard as well as absolutely miserable graphical performance.  The concept of team play was cool back when L4D came out but now it just feels like a cheap copy with aliens.  The special aliens are wannabe imitations of L4D's specials and the game struggles to hold my attention for very long.  One level was all I needed to know I wouldn't like this game.3/10 POOR Overall."
