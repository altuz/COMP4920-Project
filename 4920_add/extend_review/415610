Can be completed in 7-8 hours.Recommended for:Players who can handle crude humor, some pixel nudity and for lovers of the point & click genre.The good:+ Interesting characters, world and storyline+ Well animated+ Voice acting is good (in Russian, adding to the atmosphere)+ Good port to Unity with plenty of achievements and trade cards+ Alt+tab works fine, and so does the Steam overlay (even in your native resolution, which is rare for old games!)The bad:- Too many random pauses between voice lines- Inconsistent art at some points (some characters look like they were drawn in MS Paint, for example the woman at the train station)- English translation is good, but has some errors in it (been typed as ""ben"", shall typed as ""shell, etc)- The hints are sometimes completely useless and confusing- Game file compression: 400 MB download, but takes 3 GB of disk space, which is A LOT for a game from 1998- No music in a lot of interior maps- Some of the walking animations are long, tedious and unskippable.- There's only autosave. While this works fine, you're at constant risk to ruin your progress if you click ""new game"" in the main menu by accident. This is a poor design decision.- No actual tutorial telling you that you can quick travel using the map, explains interaction, ...Gameplay:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXof68TtA6Y(slightly cut, no voice comments)"
76561197972640060,Recommended,415610,28839203,"Posted: 30 December, 2016",all,Nurdbot,A strange but different combination of Sam & Max Hit the Road and Full Throttle meeting slightly off the wall mid nineties post Soviet Russian humour. The characters are basically over the top versions of Soviet folklore fighting in a cartoon over the top version of the Russian Civil War which when you think about it is a strange but very endearing concept when it comes to settings.The comedy whilst slightly dated is translated well (the dialogue is subtitled and you can speed read it if you are somehow not a big fan of listening to decent Russian voice acting) while the puzzles are slightly zany but a solid Hint system can help you in times point and click dear air. The only thing slightly off about it is the fan service nature of one of the characters but that cannot be helped due to the progress of time (this series apparently kept going until 2009 apparently too).The only question really is the 2nd game worth it if you enjoyed the first one? I would honestly pick up both as the 2nd game really feels more like a epilogue or DLC expansion due to being only 3 hours long and using assets from the 1st quite a bit.But it is enjoyable if you like this old but entertaining genre of a game.

Game is great  for people that aren't as good in old school adventure games as me. When you have item you collected you will know when and where you can use it, so you will not have to run in circles not knowing where to use something just to progress in the game. That way all frustration is gone, making this game more casual experience but that nice feeling you get after beating a puzzle stays. You also have HELP option giving you tip for the next quest you need to do to progress. Great music background also helps, it never gets tiresome. This game is pure definition of hidden gem, and for the price you dont have to think twice about picking it up. You will not be disappointed!"

,Recommended,415610,34562457,Posted: 28 August,all,Kain Klarden,"Red Comrades Save the Galaxy: Reloaded is a remaster of a classic RU point and click adventure, the very first big(ger) budget one, which was so influential it essentially borne a new sub-genre of typified ""Russian quests"" (""quest"" being how ""adventure"" genre was known due to Sierra series) - wacky pop culture heavy parody adventure games. And yet, despite always having a soft spot for adventure titles, this was my first ever time playing it, simple due to how incredibly pop-culture reference and cheap comedy reliance, which is not something I ever liked.As a glimpse on what late 90s post-soviet parody/humor could be, it's a great history piece. And it's also a surprisingly well put together, quite well animated and relatively well paced game in its own right - it doesn't feel ""cheap"", rather - intentionally ugly, but with a lot of polish and thought underneath. That said, given that a lot of its humor is based on racial, gender and historical stereotypes and typical jokes of late-/post-soviet times, you might not get it or find it funny. Personally, I wouldn't find it particularly funny even in the late 90s, but I'm still glad I went with this experience and finally played the game."

The game is a collection of clichés, jokes and gag about Sovet Russia. And greatly exaggerated. It is worth and fun to play.For non-Russian speakers: The game has lost a lot because of the translation. Petka and Vasily Ivanovich speak very flowery, many phrases with double meaning. In the translation all this is not present, it translates only the meaning of the phrase not the style and feelings. Many phrases simply omitted or distorted."

Except alcoholic beverage and boobies.+ Fascinating story+ Great humour+ Russian voice acting+ Suitable music- Some wierd gaps/pauses in middle of dialogs- Some sprites are drawn in worse quality than others- Minor errors in some translations/mouse over labelsOverall rating ☭/☭. Let's drink to that!
,Recommended,415610,32432212,Posted: 15 June,all,Khunty,I don't know why but my first impression it looked pretty lame... But I ended up loving it and just bought the second. Highly recommend to point and click fans.
,Recommended,415610,23951586,"Posted: 30 June, 2016",all,andrew.spud [PT],"I didn't  know the existence of this gem. I'll be honest; I kinda found it because of the last Steam summer sale. I was browsing for cheap point-&-click games, since I'm saving money for a new desktop, and current using my old laptop from the year 2k04'ish.So, after I've read the description of the game, and check the minimum system requirements, I knew I had to have it on my steam library....and what can I say about this Red Comrades Save the Galaxy: Reloaded?It's a fun, irreverent point-&-click game full of crude humor, corny jokes, cheesy situations, sexual innuendos, and alot of Democratic socialist Vs Capitalist Vs Imperialist type of jokes mixed with some 80’s/90’s Eastern and Western pop culture references, and a large number of Rabinovich, Vasily Ivanovich type of characters. Since it’s a classic point-&-click game, the gameplay is “traditional” simple, you need to get some item to make some character satisfied, then that character will give you another item for you to combine with other item, that will make you able to get another item for other character, and so on. The story is equal simple, two stooges soldiers of the red guard found out their Bolshevik banner was stolen, and they need to find it before Lenin found out. On the way to find where the hell is the red banner, they got a huge help from their beloved neighbour Anka, a blonde comrade which is also a red army spy, working in Imperialist territory, in the process our two heroes found out their major problem isn’t the missing banner, but a grand alien invasion, and a conspiracy which may jeopordize the october revolution in the first place.I recommend this game, if you like the Point-&-click genre, and want to play something different with some similarities with the game Leisure suit Larry. The animations are quite good, same for the environment, there’s a good “hint” system, alot of easter eggs, the music is simple and corny but quite enjoyable while you’re playing, and having the original russian audio is quite good.The few cons I found, (ok, I never played the game outside the Steam), but I think the game needed more Steam achivements, there’s some situations in it crying out loud for an achievement, the other problem is some of the animations are quite long, specially in the Alien spaceship, where there’s a part with an escalator and we need to see the character climbing the slow escalator every frikkin’ time we want to go to the control panel, which could had a ""Ground Control to Major Tom"" achivement.The other problem is how can I explain the game to my communist friends? Everytime I talk to them about the game they ask “why should I play it?” and my explanation quite doesn’t make any sense and that make me smile because Red Comrades: Save the Galaxy is a good old non-sensless point-&-click game.and I definitely recommend it."

Except *bro grab* IT´S BACK!Even though the game is mostly awesome cause of numerous not so well translatable jokes and references to old russian anecdotes, I would still suggest non-russian gamers to try it out. It´s old-school, it´s bizarre and absolutely brilliant! Also the voice acting is amazing.Casual control scheme or more like casual game style helps to deal with cryptic puzzles - the game is perfectly managable in one long sitting. I remember I needed years (no kidding) and lots of phone calls to my more bright/inventive classmates to complete it. Sometimes its too subtle,  sometimes you really wanna know what the developers team was smoking.If the next parts are being prepared for release - shut up and take my money."

Boring story with little incentive and motivation to complete the story. The end goals are poorly defined. Poor voice acting. A lot is lost in subpar Russian to English translation.

The game revolves around many elements of the Russian folklore, I'm not sure if someone who doesn't have a Soviet background will understand, the English translation is not very good, the puzzles themselves are not very hard though they all make sense, no moon logic, the game is not very hard but you do have great time while playing,"
