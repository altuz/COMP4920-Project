,Recommended,415670,20485009,"Posted: 12 January, 2016",all,Chewable C++,"This is a fantastic word game. One of the best I've ever encountered.What makes it great? The full package. It's a good boggle type game that also happens to have a very fun story (written by an actual young adult fiction writer) and a nice overall presentation.And, it's obvious that the developer set out to make a good game, not just another lame clone with minor variations. In all honesty, I was expecting the latter when I bought it (I'm a sucker for boggle clones), but I was really surprised!I won't spoil the story at all, but it's just a lot of fun. The gameplay is arranged into a (long) series of individual levels, with short (mostly dialogue) cutscenes in between. At first I assumed that the cutscenes were lazy fluff, but I found myself actually looking forward to each one! Especially on the later levels that proved quite challenging and make me work harder for the next scene.The gameplay itself isn't standard boggle, it's the Bookworm Deluxe type variant where tiles disappear and the grid falls downward when you make a word. Like Bookworm Deluxe, it also has some special tiles. But, it gets more complicated...Instead of just trying to form big words quickly (most levels are actually not timed), you typically need to ""rescue"" characters that appear as tiles in the grid, by getting them to the bottom. Each character, while still on the grid, also has special abilities that can be played at the cost of moves or time. Each level either gives you a set amount of moves or set amount of time to complete.The characters (most of them, anyway), have an oxygen gauge. If you let their oxygen run low, you lose, so you have to either rescue them very quickly, or replenish their oxygen by connecting them as part of words to blue letter tiles.There's a variety of special tiles like glass, fire, and debris, that require different strategies to deal with properly.So, unlike most boggle clones that are about speed, this one tends to be much more about strategy - not just trying to find the longest word, but making the right word in the right place at the right time, and knowing when to use the special abilities.There are also arithmetic levels with numeric tiles instead, where the goal is to form a specific sum (tiles include positive and negative numbers from -9 to 9 (but not 0).There are a lot of levels with a slowly increasing difficulty curve. The later levels can present decent challenges even to seasoned word gamers. Besides the basic goal of the level (usually rescuing the characters), there are also stars awarded for performance (usually score, but not always), a leaderboard for every level (steam integrated), and special ""banana"" goals for most levels (these are for forming particular kinds of words, e.g. 7+ letters). So, plenty to do, plenty to shoot for.For achievement hunters, if you're good at boggle games, this might take you 20-30 hours to 100% (as long as you're also not terrible at arithmetic).The base price is quite fair, and the introductory sale price is quite generous. Definitely one of the better purchases I've made."
,Recommended,415670,20422823,"Posted: 9 January, 2016",all,ReivaX,"Unlike in some word games where the lenght of words is really important (Letter Quest), or games that are really difficult if you're not a native speaker (looking at you Lexica), this game hits the right spot between difficulty and fun.Words lenght can be important if you want to get 3 stars in every levels, but even with a couple of short words you can still get the 3 stars rating. The goal of this game is to bring the characters to the bottom of the screen by using the letters on the grid, many levels aren't timed but gives you a limit of words to use which allows you to take your time and find better words instead of rushing and just doing 3 letters words.So if like me english isn't your first language and you are hesitating to rather buy the game or not, let me tell you that as long as you have an average vocabulary this game is fun and not too difficult nor too easy for people like us :)Have a great day."
,Recommended,415670,20728370,"Posted: 24 January, 2016",all,Athravan,"Highrise Heroes is a boggle-style word building game where you match adjacent tiles to make the best word possible, triggering various score bonuses and explosions based on the strategy you went for. Whilst a story may seem like an unlikely addition to this type of game, it does actually have an element of mystery and discovery as you try to figure out what exactly went down in this bizarre skyscraper. In between each of the levels there is dialogue, which is a little bit tongue in cheek bad. I thought it was actually well written, but with characters that are designed to be obvious tropes and the writer was clearly looking for groans and facepalms along the way. Nothing too serious and it did actually make me laugh a few times.As the game unfolds you get more and more characters, each of which has a special ability. The characters you get on each level are story-based, so you don't get to choose. Some levels include things like saving a teddy bear, or mopping up some water along the way. There are also a lot of monkeys, collectible flag-based bananas and a character named Captain Amazeballs, because why not.In addition to the regular word challenges, there are occasional number levels where you need to match combinations of numbers, both positive and negative which I found surprisingly fun. Not fun enough to want a whole game based around it, but enough to keep it fresh every now and again.Some of the levels are incredibly simple, but others, especially the timed challenges, are incredibly hard! There's a little bit of a disconnect in difficulties, but generally speaking as you progress to the end of the game, it gets harder, and harder and harder... I would say that this is probably one of the more challenging word-based games to complete that I've played and at times, a little frustrating, but I got there in the end.Overall the amount of strategy, different level types, different challenges and increasing difficulty makes this one of the most feature-complete word games I've played - with a lot of replayability in the star and score system, including global and friend based leaderboards. It's not just another clone, it does bring originality so it gets a thumbs up from me."

It's a clever word play game which, although based on a conventional word-finding mechanic, provides a surprisingly wide variety of challenges.The background music is nice without being obtrusive and sounds like it's probably been remastered / whatever for the Steam version; it really sounds nice on my computer. Unfortunately the options for music are just on/off and I really prefer a volume control but I guess that's what my mixer is for.And . . . the letters always seem to be arranged in a way that you find incredibly long words. This makes you feel either super bright or super lucky. Or maybe that's just me because I am theBOSSof HH.Also great:the dialogue is surprisingly wittybetter character development than most gamesit has a monkey!Haven't you always wanted a monkey?Rating: 10 bananas (out of 1 pocket).I would totally rescue Sir Arthur from the rubble again."
,Recommended,415670,20460846,"Posted: 10 January, 2016",all,KipofMudd,"Wow this is a phenomenal word game. Steam is lacking great word games and this one fills the void quite nicely. It also had a few levels that were math levels too, which were a nice surprise and changed up the gameply in a nice way.As you can see, you're just making words like in Boggle where you use connected letters. However, this game has obvious obstacles and other things to stop you the later you get in the game to make it a little more of a challenge. And as usual, the letters fall down when used, and if you make a 5 letter word or longer you get blocks that explode removing more blocks and getting more points. There's also character blocks that let you expand the words to use letters further away that you couldn't normally reach, the characters give you abilties you can use to help you beat levels and of course you have to save the charcters each level while making sure they they keep their oxygen levels high enough, which is just linking blocks of oxygen into them before finishing your wordAll in all, I comepletely recommend this if you like word games. You will definitely, 100% not be disappointed. I can't believe how good this game is with it having such a low price. It seems to have a fairly large amount of content as well."

Well, here you go. Highrise Heroes tasks you with spelling, keeping your folks oxygenated, maneuvering through rubble and impassable tiles, managing your turns (survivors have helpful powers but they cost turns to use). Sometimes you'll be racing the clock, sometimes you won't. There's plenty of variety that I've seen so far, so it's not repetitive. There are plenty of achievements and objectives to keep you addicted for hours at a time."

About half way through the game it goes off the rails. The difficulty level spikes and it becomes less of a word game and more about constantly retrying a level hoping for some decent letters. The timed levels are also annoying given the poor controls."

,Recommended,415670,28818081,"Posted: 29 December, 2016",all,Obawan,"Trapped inthe Burj Khalifaa non-descript generic everyday tall skyscraper that has no visual similarities to any well-known tallest buildings, you and a small group of co-workers must (a) get out of the skyscraper and (b) work out what on earth happened in the first place. Both of these things are accomplished through a boggle/bookworm type word-game that becomes progressively challenging.One of the usual complaints I have with these type of word games is the ""obscure Scrabble syndrome"" where some otherwise nonsensical word hidden away in the deepest darkest less frequented pages of a dictionary always score you some points. This game still has some of those, but less frequent that it becomes unnoticeable. Forming words is a nice challenge with some occasional obstacles or stage rules, f.ex. having to include character tiles as you form words so their health/oxygen bars don't run out; freeing character tiles from 'debris' tiles; using timed letters in words to clear a level. All these little challenges add to a word game that otherwise could have been like every other word game out there.In story mode, there is a definite story happening - it has cheesy dialogue; comedic at times; and is really just a nice touch of fluff to a word game. There is a challenge mode as well, which if you happen to be playing story mode and manage to unlock/complete a challenge, you do get credit for it. Something I thought was nice to have.There is a friendslist leaderboard and a global leaderboard that pops up after each level so you can see how well you are doing compared to others, or as a reminder you have no friends with similar interests. Your choice!However way you play it, escaping fromthe Burj Khalifathe generic looking no relation to the tallest building skyscraper is a nice side-story to a word game that offers some casual play on a commute, during a server maintenance or to fulfill some achievement hunting."

The games are fast and easy to restart if it isn't going well.  It is easy enough to do well, but sometimes you have try try several times to get 3 stars, and sometimes I just settle for 2 stars :) .  I liked the idea of an objective to help the characters fall to the bottom to be saved, oxygen levels replenished by blue tiles when connected a word to a character, bombs to defuse by including them in a word, and explosions from larger words.  I really loved the mechanics all the way to the end.I completely ignored the story.  It is just a lot of text to read.  It was plenty fun without giving me eye strain trying to reaed it all on my TV.  It ran great on my Alienware Alpha Windows 10 on my 47"" TV.  I used an xbox 360 gamepad (with Controller Companion to enable) and it was a breeze to play."
,Recommended,415670,34678345,Posted: 2 September,all,bugonawall,"I love word games and this one does not disappoint. Think Boggle/Scramble/Book Worm game play with obstacles. The mechanics are flawless and easy to understand, you match tiles, create new words and some later levels even throw number matching. I think part of the fun was weaving letters through the characters to connect other letters across the board and create larger words. Some levels have time limits, some don't. The time limit levels are about making words fast regardless the length, while the non-timed ones gain more points through longer words. After so many levels the gameplay changes a bit to keep it interesting.I loved all the characters. Each one brings a new ability which cost turns. The story mode actually has a story! The character interactions are amusing. The graphics are top notch for a word game. I’ll cut this review about here, since all I can do is continue praising this game.Bought Highrise Heroes while on sale, but I assure you, it's worth every penny of $4.99. Love this game. It is far superior word game among the others I have played on Steam."

Usually just connect a word with so many goes idea. And a few twists in there like connecting your characters to the words to keep them alive with air.Visuals excellent.

,Recommended,415670,33101446,Posted: 1 July,all,unevermind,"Highrise Heroes is a scrabble type game with a story tie-in. In the absence of Popcap's Bookworm Adventures (2) from Steam this is the closest you will get to word-puzzling in a motivating plot.I have put some good 20 hours into the mobile version of this - at least it felt like that - maxing all levels to 3 stars. So I knew what I would get buying the Steam release.Or maybe I did not. Because the port is a bit lackluster. No volume control and lack of other settings; since you do not use your fingers but drag a mouse there should be some additional visual feedback on mouse movement; there are no additional visuals to fill the panorama screen format. It is pretty much a 1 on 1 port with (admittedly) better resolution.Does this make it a bad game?No. I still like the challenge the game poses. You definitely have to have some affinity for the type of game. Casuals might get burned - especially with mouse control - but that makes it a full-fledged game.I like the mechanics of linking words, I like the art style, I like the different goals per level. While I prefer taking my time to produce the longest word possible, timed levels and mini targets introduce variety. There is more to explore if you want to collect all bananas (e.g. create a palindrome in specific level), which offers some replayability.The biggest plus, however, is the story. When I was playing it on my phone I thought the developers actually had not completed the game. As the main goal of the game is to get to the ground floor of the building you know more or less how far you have progressed (on floor 40 you have ~40 more levels to go). It dragged on for so long that I was certain that the devs could not possibly bring it to a good conclusion.Boy, was I wrong.Yes, the details along the way might get boring. Losing someone in the rubble only to cross their path again five levels later is not all that exciting. But it builds up to one of the best game endings I have seen. I felt emotionally invested. In a darn mobile game that I played on the train. A puzzle game! So I will give the devs cudos for that!Yet, I would not recommend it for the story alone. To conclude:>>>>>> IF you are into word-puzzling and like visual novel type stories>>>>>> GO FOR IT"
