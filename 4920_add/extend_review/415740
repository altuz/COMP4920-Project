,Recommended,415740,23297221,"Posted: 30 May, 2016",all,LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME DOOOOO,"As a sarcastic anti-game,OmniBusis a masterpiece in its own right, arguably the best of its kind since landmark cult hitGoat Simulatorarrived some years back.Viewed as any other release? Positive-leaning mixed feelings.The concept of a vehicular platformer is a an exceedingly rare novelty in itself. I struggle to think of any other game that defines itself as such, much less so in the wayOmniBusdares to present itself. To consider this anything less than commendable would be a disservice.Mind you, that's not to sayOmniBusdoesn't have its shortcomings; the lack of a camera control makes certain actions harder than they really need need to be, the physics are often far more unpredictable than reasonably anticipated and while the humor works for me, others are likely to put off -- dry sarcasm is very much a love it or hate it sort of thing.The same could also be said for the game's aesthetics; early 90s throwback visuals and bouncy chiptune are right up my alley, but for those unaccustomed to a period when the average game looked and felt no different? Further disappointment.To put it simply:OmniBusisn't a game for everyone. Then again, it isn't trying to be, and maybe that's really what I like about it best, anyway."
,Recommended,415740,23227588,"Posted: 26 May, 2016",all,Gyanreyer,"This game is absolutely nowhere near perfect, but I'm finding it to be very entertaining.Basically the premise is that you're Omnibus, a bus that endlessly accelerates with no brakes that must travel the world, completing challenges and helping people along the way. Yeah, everything about this game is kinda ridiculous but it's actually incredibly funny and charming as a result.Here's the deal though, if you're not into the whole ""whacky physics challenge"" games like Surgeon Simulator or QWOP where part of the entire challenge is just fighting against the game, then you probably won't enjoy this much. Your bus can go flying at the drop of a hat and there's a lot of wrestling with physics and trying to keep your bus under control which can quickly go from funny to maddening. I've gotten stuck on a couple levels and felt quite frustrated, but in the end they don't take too much of your time to play and when you beat them it feels very satisfying, as a challenging game should.Now what's crazy is how incredibly creative the devs got - so far every single level has presented a new, unique challenge from anything before it that is still very fun and interesting, whether that be driving in a top-heavy tour bus trying not to tip over and lose your passengers or driving up the side of a building to knock King Kong off the top. It's very hard but addictive, and the ridiculous stupidity of it all just makes it that much better.With the fact that each level has a gold medal that you can shoot for and there's a local multiplayer mode that looks kinda fun, I can see this game having a ton of replay value, and I'm definitely happy with my purchase. If it looks interesting to you, I say go for it, you'll get a sense of the game pretty quick and you can easily refund if it's not your thing!"
,Not Recommended,415740,31860346,Posted: 20 May,all,Ryan Dorkoski,"On one handOmniBuscomes off at times like a total 'gimmick' joke game, but other times it teases with the possibility of being a fully realized game based on skill and maybe even real speedrunning material.I think it struggles by not taking a side, along with a price tag that merits something more beefy. If you are on the fence - play the demo - that will give you a good idea of what you are in for.The first major problem withOmniBusis that some of it is skill-based, but alot of itisn't.There were too many times where I was just flopping around with different bus mechanics to get the win. Yeah, maybe there are people out there that have devoted enough time to 'getting good' at this, but there are many,manyother more solid titles for that kind of time dump. The upside (and part that teases of a more serious game) is that nearly every level has something unique and interesting about it. There obviously was some thought put into this.Another problem is rough edges and lack of polish. Honestly, this feels like a game that was made in some weekend jam. And I'm not talking about one that started there and then had many more months of TLC and polish. It feels like a few of those 'Humble Originals' they tack onto the end of the Monthly Bundles. But it costs ten bucks. The biggest problem for me is that you cannot control the camera (ie. with the right stick, usually). So you really can't see where you are going and this adds a layer of difficulty that just feels artifical. The mechanics of the bus feel 'ok' at best, and at worst, they feel floaty and a bit too random.Pros:+I love theidea, although the execution leaves something to be desired. Trust me on this - go playRoundAboutinstead.+Music is the best part.+Level design and variation is really good.+Controller support is good, and menus are lean and functional.+Humor is good, although it has been done before.+Could be a decent title to try to get 100% achievementsCons:-I thinkOmniBushas an identity crisis; it doesn't know if it wants to be a fairly serious speedrunning/skill-based game, or simply novelty.-While the more skill-based levels are fun, there are too many that just feel random.-No camera, which adds artificial difficulty (at least with the nonlinear levels - which are most of them).-All of the 'cons' add up to it being overpriced.I'd just as soon pass on this one.Go forRoundAboutif you haven't played that yet."

,Recommended,415740,23230209,"Posted: 27 May, 2016",all,Jansen :3,"It's been a while since I've played a game with as much charm and creativity as this one. Though the story mode might be on the short side, every level offers something different. I was surprised by just how much variety there was, with some game mechanics being created for one level only. The dialogue given to you before and after each level is very enjoyable, and the whole game has a great goofy tone to it. Nothing quite like using a propeller, a firework, a jet engine, and a soda bottle to shoot yourself to the moon.It's not a very easy game, often taking one good hit to force you to restart a level. Fortunately, the stages are short enough and restart quick enough that this isn't really an issue. Though I must admit, having my bus almost jump up and spin around after hitting a tiny snag was frustrating on occasion. Omnibus isn't perfect, but it does have a great feel, especially when your bus of choice reaches over 100 mph.Though it may be short, there is a lot of replay value here. Each level hides a hat to collect, and there are target scores/times to beat in each stage. Not to mention secret areas to find. Plus, free-play mode is great fun - feeling a bit like a Pro Skater game in a bus. You can even challenge up to 4 people to a split-screen bus deathmatch.In short, if you're looking for a few solid hours of silly fun, I'd totally recommend this one."

There's not much to do unless you decide to attempt to collect all the hats in the game.  It could use to be a lot longer (and thusly give you a lot more to do) but other than 'lack of content' this game doesn't commit any other sins.  It's a lot of fun, and I really enjoyed it.  Some of my friends said it got boring or repetitive or it was too short, but that didn't stop me from enjoying it.  Try it out!  I'm still trying to collect all the hats!"
76561198067073796,Not Recommended,415740,23242213,"Posted: 27 May, 2016",all,raven_pride,"I had pretty high hopes for this game. The trailer was pretty funny and I liked the overall concept, so I preordered it while it was on sale. However, there are some major gameplay issues that have made OmniBus one of the most frustrating games I've ever purchased. (I do realize that OmniBus is *supposed* to be ridiculous and perhaps even mildly frustrating by its very nature, but there are several *unintentional* issues with the game that severely limit its enjoyability.)First, and most importantly, are the mid-air controls. The primary challenge of OmniBus (and, theoretically, the fun) is in recovering from the wild arcs that your bus takes through the sky after it's launched to the stars by bumpers, ramps, TNT, and more. However, the way the controls are oriented makes the bus almost impossible to land safely, leaving your bus's fate up to chance. The issue lies in the fact that the left/right keys (and A/D keys) cause the bus to do a barrel roll in either direction. A more intuitive approach would be to make the aforementioned keys rotate the bus horizontally around the X-Y plane. I also recommend increasing the rate at which the bus's rotation accelerates in the direction the user chooses; right now, it's extremely difficult to influence how the bus lands.Second, the physics engine is bizarre. I know, I know, weird things are supposed to happen in this game, but there are still obvious glitches that make no physical sense. For instance, oftentimes when my bus is on only two if its four wheels for a short period of time, it gets launched into the air without warning. Hopefully these sorts of problems are fixed relatively soon as players report them via reviews and the Google Form the devs provided along with the release.Third, many of the levels are poorly designed. For example, the bandit level (in which you have to knock over 9 bandit vehicles before being knocked over yourself) can be won by doing absolutely nothing and just letting the bandits run into you; they often tip themselves over as they collide with you, and when *you* get tipped over, the bandits keep running into you, which turns your vehicle upright. Another example is the train robbery level, in which the bus falls straight through the train tracks that bridge various plateaus.Fourth, the way the camera pans at the beginning of each level can be dizzying. Plus, there are often situations where skipping the camera pan offers a major strategic advantage at the beginning of a level, but there's no indication to the player that the pan is skippable (which it is by pressing the spacebar).Most of the issues I described above are very fixable, which is nice. I'd happily give OmniBus a thumbs-up if they were fixed - it isn't far from being a highly enjoyable game."

,Not Recommended,415740,31987262,Posted: 26 May,all,fancy ghost ☂,"Fun idea and it's a decent time waster but its physics are terribly inconsistent. Just a little more polish is all it needs but in its current state I can't recommend it, many of the levels rely on luck as opposed to skill simply because it's so unpredictable whether you'll have enough momentum this time, or if one of the AI vehicles will happen to be in a certain place at a certain time, or if you're unlucky enough for a minor bump to fling you at 200 mph off the map. As it is, it's incredibly frustrating at times to know what to do and how to do it, and have that yanked away from you at the last second because the physics decide to have a fit."

The graphics look really nice and it was addicting. Be warned this is a rage game and that is my main problem with it. The controls for when you are flying need A LOT of work. Right now if you are spun into the air the controls might as well not be there. It is basically just comes down to luck if you will land upright, this needs to change and being flung through the air is one of the main components of the game. Please also let us control the yaw while in the air. Other than that this was a fun game and I would recommend it even with the problems it has."

I get the joke of having wonky physics or a bus that easily flips over, but you're going to spend a lot of time in air not playing the game and landing upside down to start the level over from instant death. The joke wears thin quickly.The joke of odd physics is way funnier when something looks initially real, or when something is going right like racing well in Burnout only to crash into a million pieces. The graphics here are Jaguar level and the bus is too unwieldy to feel like you're doing well.Imagine if rather than being qwop/happy wheels inspired this game played with the tightness of controls Rocket League has. The levels could be scaled to be harder and you'd have a more fun game, one that was overall less frustrating.Omnibus is still a good game though. It's really varied in terms of level type, and the final boss even has you use all the basic mechanics to beat the game (something that many modern games forget to do.) You can also skip any level which is nice if you get fed up. I beat the game at 5 hours skipping 2 levels.I'd really like them to take another shot with this concept. Take the silliness out of the controls and put it into more of their inventive level ideas!"

76561198105592989,Recommended,415740,30333086,Posted: 5 March,all,R O B G O D,"A ball of chocolate with a spicy pepper in the middle.The opening levels are fun and quirky and the game has a ton of charm and personality, taking the simple gameplay notion of a bus that can't slow down or stop and making every single kind of mini game they can with that concept, set to a cheery 8 bit soundtrack, a visually striking PS1 art style and some genuinely chuckle-worthy writing.However, the charm wears off FAST, as the later levels ramp up the challenge by adding in new gameplay quirks, new obstacles, new mechanics, and a ungodly amount of trial and error. For example, in World 4 (I do not know how many overall worlds there are), there is a stage that asks you to drive a bus that can jump first across several cliffs, then onto a draw bridge separated into the three pieces you must jump between that will sway RIDICULOUSLY fast completely upside down if you are even a milimeter off center, THEN you have to jump from the bridge, probably at a terrible angle, into a literal minefield stacked with TNT crates so densely that it's nearly impossible even with full control to avoid them, and if you somehow make past all that there is STILL MORE as there is a nest of moving bumpers and possibly even another challenge after that, I ragequited after a solid 20 minutes on that level alone, already upset at an earlier set of levels that implemented a strange gravity mechanic that I had to look up gameplay footage of to understand how to work. Challenges that could make up 3, 4 or even 5 separate levels in other indie platformers are jampacked into checkpoint-less gauntlets that feel like they were designed for rage-based YouTube gameplay videos.The difficulty isn't helped by the physics, either. They are consistent and fully functional, but they are unrealistic and therefore often unpredictable, especially since they change without warning for certain stages. On the ground, the gimmick of never being able to stop, slow or even change the camera goes from amusing to annoying as the difficulty ramps up, as the game demands deliberate forethought while giving you a set of controls that makes such a thing literally impossible, contributing to the aforementioned overall aura of Trial and Error. On the air, the problem is way more excerbated as you have almost zero control over your bus once it's airborne, which leads to a lot of cheap deaths. In a Tony Hawk game, if you bail from a midair trick, it's because you misjudged a half pipe or went for too many flips. If you bail in midair in this game, it's because the game randomly decided to make you spin 21 times instead of 20 and therefore you landed upside down. Given that there's a physics engine, it's not actually random, I'm sure, but it certainly feels like it in certain stages.Now, platforming challenge is platforming challenge, and you might just say I need to 'git gud', but the difficulty - the amount of obstacles on screen, the janky mechanics you have to master with little instruction, the crazy one hit kill spots - genuinely doesn't feel fair after World 2, like I said it seems to go almost entirely into trial and error, in which you can't possibly predict what's next; one hit kill bumpers and explosives are placed inside or behind buildings, completely removed from your view, so that you will literally not be able to react to them on first run unless you single frame reactions. For me, at least, waiting eagerly to see what funny dialogue or cool hat or interesting stage the game was going to throw at me turned into waiting anxiously to see what half-functioning mechanic or overpowered boss or cheap and broken segment the game was going to throw at me. I know Dark Souls comparisons are beyond cliche, but it literally starts to feel like that as one mistake - which is incredibly easy to make for all the reasons listed above - WILL kill you and force you to restart (to the game's credit, there is a dedicated restart button and there isn't any lag between death and restart).The reason for the title of my review - Omnibus seems like it's going to be a short, sweet and charming treat but after the first few layers quickly turns into a chafing, painful ordeal that you only keep soldering through just you can say you did.However, despite all my complaints, I still have it listed as Recommended, as like I said the first few levels still have a ton of charm, and if you're a fan of brutal, masochistic, perfectionism based platformers, (Johns, I am not) you will still love the game. If you aren't, you might still crank some fun out of the multiplayer and the sheer experience, and with the game's low price point (which saves the game honestly, at $20 this would be utter garbage), it's worth a dip if you're curious."

Losing control of your bus just once means restarting the entire level, because the times are tight and the levels are small and the entire point of the game is that the bus wants to fly through the air and flip a million times.  Trying to take the whole game as it is robs it of what was supposed to be about, instead of wreaking havoc and flipping across a destructible landscape it becomes about staying on the ground and desperately avoiding any props because it means doom.In the future, I would like to see what else these devs are capable of because they have a unique eye and some good ideas.  I just hope their next foray focuses more on gameplay that is unironically good, instead of ironically bad."

Why devs won't support other controlers and why gamers accept this BS is completely beyond me.Even with an Xbox controller the A button seems unmapped. This is a known issue that has been mentione on the thread in several places and still no one is doing sh*t about it.I really really wanted to like this game. I love simple throw backs. I love silly arcade games you can just jump into, epecially fun driving games. But this game was just massively frustrating with so many simple and glaring issues - like the devs clearly don't give a crap about this steaming pile and are trying to play of their utter lack of effor as - 'hey look cool retro!'For instance:* Can't tell what times you need for silver or gold until after a run is completed* No clock in run so you can't tell if you are on par or not* Forward and backward rotation while airborn barely work yet are required to do almost everything.* A lot of missions and general mechanics come down to flat luck, how your car bounces and sh&t which just removes all fun from the game for me.* In ability to remap controls at allIn general, if you are desperate for a fun throw-back arcade game and this is on sale for like $2 or less, maybe it's worth it. Otherwise serious f-this pile."
