It reminded me of some of my favorite Japanese horror movies, like “One Missed Call”. It has a nice set-up in a small Japanese town, the characters look like typical high-school students with their own problems and….curses.But I don`t want to write spoilers, so will just say that the story itself has nice twists in best traditions of Japanese horrors. I should also say, that at first the main characters – Kuoko and Kyuuhei – were not really pleasant in some ways. Kuoko was shown as a type of girl who plays with boys and uses them for her benefit – quite an awful character, don`t you think? Kyuuhei was annoying at some point but I think it`s just my own issue, so no wonder I started to really like him later, when I saw more of him.Also, the art was really nice. I liked Kuoko in particular. Music was suitable too and added to the atmosphere.All in all, the game is not really long: it took me around 3 hours to complete it and get all possible endings. Still, the experience was quite enjoying and the price is quite low, so if you`re looking for a nice short game to give you goosebumps (if you are as paranoid as I am, at least) I`d recommend you to try it."

Published by YOX-Project [obviously its not real if its real I would have been dead by now]The storyKyuuhei Inui has never been one to take rumors as anything but that - rumors, until his best friend had died while playing the game....Kyuuhei is driven to find out the truth behind his friend's mysterious death by any means possible.After exhausting all ideas, he decided the only way to find out the truth is to play 'BAD END' himself.Will Kyuuhei risk his life to get to the bottom of the game's mystery or will he meet his demise?Audio and Visual elementsVisual Elements -There was minor inconsistency in some sprites but it not obvious and its not going to be a huge impact. I wished there was more CGs really looking at how talented the artist is I wished there were more but considering the price of them game I cannot expect much, overall good visual elements.Audio Elements -Music comes in perfectly, nothing to fancy here worth mentioning other than It just fits in perfectly in the situation and the environment.To sum upI do recommend this Visual Novel and the price is cheap considering the work being put into BAD END it is cheap. Pacing in the story was perfect it was not rushed at all and it is not too slow too loved the pacing for BAD END.AfterwordsI liked the Bad ending you get in the visual novel as it is sudden and there is very less details given but after you died a few times that is where things get clearer which is a good move as the story progresses it still keeps that shroud of mystery around them.Click here to the full review!"

,Recommended,415850,19356243,"Posted: 28 November, 2015",all,Zaxarie,"I went into ""Bad End"" expecting mediocre horror, and I got exactly what I signed up for. Under those conditions, I absolutely recommend it. It's unintentionally funny, there are quite a few hiccups in the translation (my personal favorites being ""mean't"" and ""It isn't work throwing my life away over something like that""), and Kyuuhei is sometimes painfully oblivious.If you go in expecting to be scared, you're not going to get it. Minus one legitimate attempt at a jump scare, there's just no horror in it.But if you're here for questions such as:How long ago did [event] occur? It has been either one day or a few weeks.How is this game so popular despite the rumors that people die when they play it, no visible marketing, and a download link that never works?Wait which character said that line?What is that line even supposed to mean????""mean't""?Then go for it. I can definitely think of worse ways to spend $2 and a few hours. I highly recommend viewing/playing with friends, since it's the way most mediocre horror is ideally enjoyed and definitely made me feel warmer towards BAD END than I might have otherwise felt."
,Recommended,415850,19401489,"Posted: 30 November, 2015",all,Ocean Grown,"Bad End is a short horror VN that mimics many different Japanese Horror tropes. In Bad End we take on the role of the MC, who's best friend just died after failing to beat a new and popular mobile game.. Is this game responsible for his death? If so, then who made such a game and how does it exist? These are the mysteries that we are tasked with solving.. There are several different decisions that need to be made during the game and some of them will lead directly to death, also known as a ""Bad End"". If you can survive the game and solve the mystery, then you will get the ""True Ending"".The only problem I had with this game is that some of the decisions to be made seemed really random.. Such as, do I run left, right, or go straight when a monster is chasing me? Do I want to hang out with my friend or stay home for the day? Considering a lot of these choices lead to death, it'd be nice if the decisions I made actually gave some sort of a hint as to which one you needed to pick in order to survive. Most of the time, if I picked the wrong choice, I reloaded and picked the other choice, but that just makes things a little tedious.... Also, some of the characters in this game act really irrationally.. If a killer was chasing me down, then the last thing I'd want to do is go hang out on a roof top where no body else is around.. Or go on a date with a cute boy at school..Still, these small things aside, Bad End is a refreshing little VN and was a lot of fun for me to play through.. The game took me about 2 hours to beat, and if you use tactical reloads when you make the wrong choices in game then you will have no problem experiencing the ""True Ending"" your first play through and without the help of guide.. So for $2, go ahead and buy this VN! And when you're done, come back to this review and let me know what you think down in the comments below ^_^"

76561198048974498,Recommended,415850,26730828,"Posted: 21 November, 2016",all,rjmacready,"Same-ish looking, manga-inspired visual novels have been a bit dime-a-dozen on Steam of late; though in all fairness, this one was actually released a year ago, thereby beating a good number of them to the punch. It's also of greater interest than most to Yours Truly, given that it's in the horror genre, as opposed to the done-to-death ""romantic"" and/or perve-friendly territory which the majority of these games seem to occupy. So rather than reviewing this product from the perspective of a wet-panted teenager, I'm going to appraise it from the POV of a die-hard horror fan, which is to say: would I recommend this game to fellow horror gamers?Hmmm. Kinda yes, and kinda no.Is it ""scary""? Lord no. Especially not to anyone accustomed to the horror genre. Is it...""interesting""? Um, well, yeah...the premise certainly is, though said premise is hardly original, if you're even remotely familiar with ""Ring""-style tales of haunted videotapes and whatnot. This time out, it's a haunted mobile phone game, which allegedly kills anyone who plays it. If you find that basic idea interesting - which I certainly did - then sure, the devs explore the notion from some pretty interesting and varied angles, and create a scenario compelling enough to keep you interested, at least for a while.Having said that, I've now played through to two of an apparent thirteen endings, and I wouldn't say that either variant of the story lived up to the full potential of the premise. Whether other story paths would impress me more, I'm unsure, but for now I'm going to give it a break and come back with a fresher mind in months or years to come. No doubt many of you out there probably favour the kooky antics of these manga-styled visual novels more than I do - early Resident Evil games are about as kooky and Asian as my tastes generally get - so the more serious-minded of us horror fans were in all fairness never the target audience for this game anyway. It's certainly good of its type, I'd say, so take that statement as you will...Another obvious question: is it worth two dollars? Yeah, sure. Especially if you're going to play through to all thirteen endings. A single playthrough is well under an hour, but you could still get a good few hours out of this game, easy. So there's no issue with the price, far as I'm concerned. As long as you're prepared for what is, ultimately, a horror game aimed more at ""young"" adults than real ones, you shouldn't be too disappointed. Just don't get your hopes too high, and don't expect to have too much agency over events (choices being fairly few and far-between), and you should be sufficiently satisfied with your whopping great two buck investment.You could do better, you could do worse. Simple as that.Verdict: 6.5/10."

And while the characters aren't nothing to write home about, they aren't as annoying as I expected them to be. Which is a plus.Overall, if you're looking for a good horror visual novel fix that isn't 'Corpse Party' then buy this one for sure. At $1.98, you'll get at least 2-3 hours from it if not more for trying to get all the different 'BAD' endings.

It is somewhere between there.The story is fine and I somehow found it has an original storyline (correct me if I'm wrong) and I do enjoyed! Sadly, it was quite short and they do have potential to make it a better story with more dialogs (there are some cheezy dialogs tho) and scenes. Even though It was made by an Indie developer, the art concepts (both characters and BGPs) are great (especially Kuoko) and the soundtracks are really fit with the genre of the VN. I finished the game after two hours with all the acheivements unlocked.I only recommended this game to those who are a fan of VNs and to those who are willing to give a try.

BAD END is a Visual Novel where you are a male High School student named Kyuuhei whose best friend has died playing a mobile game called 'BAD END'. From there, you get to choose from many choices, which leads to plenty of routes and endings.BAD END is a Horror Visual Novel, but it's more like an Adventure/Puzzle game with choices than anything else. Still, it's a good game as it has a decent plot to go with.Don't go expecting being scared. In fact, you might laugh at most of the scenes, with laughable translations and failed attempts at jumpscares.Pros:- Multiple Replayability- A plot that has good cliffhanging capabilities, plot twists, decent story- Actually lived up to its name: Has multiple 'Bad Endings'- Cute backgrounds and decently drawn charactersCons:- Cheesy music; not really fit into the game, which is of Horror genre- The music is not looped correctly, but I think it's negligible- Failed to live up to its genre- No character drawing for the MC (Main Character)- Few cast to further engage the plot. It's okay, but I feel like adding more can make the VN longer, thus having a more broad storyline and plotOverall, this game is short, but with multiple replayability due to it's many endings. I think loading from save datas count as replayability too.I'd not recommend this game if you are REALLY looking for a Horror Visual Novel. But if you can spare a dollar or so, then you might as well try. It's so mediocre, it's good!"
,Recommended,415850,19300336,"Posted: 26 November, 2015",all,redsoul41,"Review - BAD END""Can you still keep on playing despite the BAD ENDs lurking behind every choice?""BAD END is horror visual novel where you play the role as  Kyuuhei Inui, a high school student who loves playing video games. It was a typical high school slice of life for Kyuuhei until his best friend, Yuuji dies by an unknown cause. Moreover, around the time of the incident, rumors have spread about a mysterious visual novel mobile game called BAD END where if you reach a bad end within the game, the player actually dies in real life.BAD END delivers a different approach to horror visual novel games. The writing style of the story adapts the traditional Japanese Horror you see on movies. The choices given in the game results to whether you continue to progress or reach a bad end immediately, making every decision shaky for the player. The art style is nice. The music could have been better if there was quite a variety but the tailoring of events made up for it.BAD END is a decent visual novel to grab. The price is well-matched for its content and it's a good visual novel to start with to anyone new to the genre especially if you're looking for a horror visual novel. It's a bit short but it's not text-heavy and remains interesting along the way. For an indie visual novel, this is one of the few good ones."

At first i was like maybe it wasn't a good idea to buy it because i am not really the type that finishes these kinds of games. To be honest it took me some time to get back to the game and so but enough talking about pointless things.Gameplay:Right when i got into the game there was very nice scenery, it's repeating itself but i dont think it matters because it's beautiful in it's own way as for the things that happened in the game.SPOILER ALERTIn the game it says that if you fail in the game by making wrong choices it you will die in real life too. Maybe i got too much into the game but i really believed it and the game made me to play on maximum. I made wrong choices and i regret them really much the feeling i got after making a bad choice i thought i would die in real life too maybe it sounds stupid but i really thought that.Characters are really awesomely made. Especially Main Girl and Boy.The con is that it's quite short it takes around 3 hours to finish like 3 endings maybe i read too slowly or something like that but even if it's kind of short i really love it as i said i am not really into these kinds of games but this one is really amazing if you are reading this then listen. This game doesn't really cost that much just spent that one euro when it's in sale and enjoy it in my opinion i never spent one euro better than this. This could be my best spent money. Maybe i am overreacting but for me this game was excellent and from now on i think iam gonna get into novels a little bit more.

It being short isn't a drawback, the game doesn't overstay its welcome, and manages to tell a full story, and for the price it's not like you're getting short-changed. It kind of gives off a similar vibe to The Ring, in my opinion, even though it's not got anything to do with creepy girls and wells. Like if someone saw The Ring and tried to make something with a similar concept into a graphic novel. If you don't mind it being a visual novel, and you like horror, you could do a lot worse. If you've got a spare £1.59, and 2-3 hours to spare, give it a go."

""Best friend of 10 years""  ""my parents will be...."" etc...Additionally, the entire first 20 min or so are completely pointless.  Presumably the author was attempting to give the reader a sense of the every-day lives of our characters and grow our attachment to them, which would have been nice if there was some actual characterization and some tension to keep the pace up, but instead we get 20 min of ""we like to play games, a lot""   A simple ""My friend and I were excited to finally be out of class so we could finally download this new game he heard about...."" or some other such conceit would have served the purpose far more meaningfully without a lot of superfolus minutia to click though."

This is my first ever experience with the genera, and despite its flaws, it left a good impression on me.You take on the role of Kyuuhei; an everyday college kid with everyday interests. It isn’t until a tragic event spirals his life into a horror mystery.Kyuuhei’s best friend, Yuuji, spends an evening at his house, wasting the hours away with videogames and conversation. It isn’t until Yuuji says something that fills the air with discomfort.  He describes a new game on the market called BAD END, in which players die in real life if they die in the game. The two trade their thoughts and even try downloading the game, but to no avail. As dusk turns to night, Yuuji decides to head home. Later, Kyuuhei is awoken by a text message. Yuuji claimed to have successfully downloaded the game on his cellphone. They talk briefly before going to bed. By dawn, Kyuuhei’s given some shocking news… Yuuji’s dead. It’s your job to uncover the truth behind BAD END and avenge your friend’s death.This is the extent of the plot. The whole concept of playing a choose-your-own-adventure game within a choose-your-own-adventure game is fun and creative, and the game juggles its two sets of characters well. The backdrops are nice on the eyes, but I don’t see myself daydreaming about their beauty. Point is, they achieve what they strive to achieve.As for characters, they’re done pretty well, both astatically and verbally. Their designs are detailed and they boast a handful of fascial reactions, but what really matters is their writing. In a game like this, your artwork may be jaw-droppingly beautiful or vomit-inducingly ugly, but story and writing will always be more important, and as for BAD END, they do an alright job. Each character portrays their own personality and uniqueness, and their writing is decent.That’s really the best word to describe this game: Decent.But don’t take that as a negative. It took me a minute to care about the story, but it wasn’t long before it engrossed me. I genuinely wanted to know what was going to happen. What BAD END reminds me of the most is a B-Horror film. It’s got the cheesy writing and cheesy plot of one, and I often felt like I was watching a Halloween Disney special. But again, that isn’t a bad thing. It lent a certain charm that only this kind of entertainment can provide, and you’ll get your money’s worth.It’s safe to say that I’ll start playing more games like this. If you’ve never experienced this genre before, you’ll be happy with BAD END’s presentation. It’s a great start for noobs like me. However, if you’re well versed in this style of entertainment, or you have higher expectations, you won’t be missing anything if you skip this one. But seeing as how cheap it is, something as harmless and simple as BAD END can be enjoyed by almost anybody."

While the premise is intriguing & the mystery is paced well, I was left feeling lukewarm. I really feel like they missed the opportunity to make a really unique experience. While the character designs are nice, the backgrounds are uninspired & repetitive, as is the music. I know I've heard some of this music before, but I'm not sure if it's stock music or from a royalty-free site.Overall, that's how I'd sum up this game: Stock. There's nothing glaringly bad, but nothing to get excited about either. It's a shame because the idea had potential. Not a bad first attempt (or at least I assume, because I didn't see any other games listed on the dev's site)."
,Not Recommended,415850,24961448,"Posted: 16 August, 2016",all,Nyx,"[TL;DR]I wish I could give a neutral review. As it stands, I'm forced to give a negative one. 3/10Is this game worth the full price tag?It's really not that expensive at £1.59 so if you are a HUGE fan of visual novels and are not exceptionally picky it may be alright. If not, wait until you find it in a bundle or it gets a discount. I have seen free-to-play games which do a better job, though admittedly not horror-based stories.[Actual Review:][Writing] The writing isn't great in a technical sense. There are grammatical errors as well as strange word choice. The characters don't speak naturally either. I doubt you'd shout ""Give me a break already!"" when running for your life but perhaps that's just me. Fortunately there's a 'history' button in the menu so if the wooden tone has lost you, you can pick back up on what's been happening. I've certainly seen a lot worse from other cheap VNs.[Plot] Have to admit, I wound up getting distracted and idling at first. I didn't manage to feel much for the main character's initial grief. It was almost mechanical. Other characters and situations were simply flat. The nod towards a few Japanese horror films might be enough to keep your attention although it's very goofy. Pacing feels off. Just when you think the game could be about to pick up, you have to click through some tedious nonsense.[Choices] If you dare to choose disbelieve early on then the game simply ends. I guess that's supposed to be cute. You have to act like a superstitious twerp to continue and despite the fact that the protagonist is described as sceptical on this Steam page, he honestly seems easily led. It takes a while to get to the choices and they don't always make much sense. If you look at the achievements you'll see they are all for getting 'bad endings'. Wish I'd taken the time to learn this. The whole point of the game appears to be what I dislike about it.[Music] I turned the music off after a short time. I found it distracting. While I think it would work for an arcade type game, it took away from any sense of unease I could get from the plot. There isn't any seperate ambient sound control and I feel some extra background effects would have livened up a few scenes.[Visual] The few characters who actually get shown are quite well drawn and the backrounds are decent. Unfortunately the text and its box look clunky in comparison to the rest. A font colour difference between the characters might have helped me focus on who was talking at which precise moment. I don't always need that but for some reason I found it hard to concentrate with BAD END.[Conclusion] It isn't completely terrible. It's certainly not enough to keep me going but others might enjoy it if they go in with realistic expectations."

Should you play Bad End? If you want to spend the $1.98. It is worth it for that price, but the visual novel itself is not good.The story is boring and cliche, and some of the lines were just really...... really? I mean really? The characters are bland. None of them develope in any way, not even the main character throguhout the course of the game. He's just dead set on beating the game, and other than a few ""Keep Playing"" choices, there's no dillemas or anything he has to face outside of the badends, and this makes the game drag on.It's honestly not even worth going through the trouble of getting the bad endings unless you do it purely for the achievments. There's practically no difference in most of them and they don't make any difference or add any new exposition at all. (Saying this because in some visual novels they add details in the bad ends that are relevant to the story, but wouln't fit in the main route.)There's really nothing else to say about the game. That's how much content it has. If you think 2 hours of stale writing is worth 2 dollars, then go for it, i personally think the price isn't too bad for what you're getting."

While the translation had some errors, they weren't too serious that you couldn't follow the story. And as far as the story goes, it's kind of a game inside a game deal. The story is about a new cell phone game (visual novel style) going around where you die in real life if you make a bad choice and get a bad ending. It kills your friend and off you go to play it yourself and solve the mystery.  Kind of like Fall into Poison, the bad endings are somewhat fun to collect, and there are Steam achievements for each. I often tried to get all the bad outcomes first before continuing with the story and it was usually pretty easy to do so. I wish they were more creative with the names.... you'll see a lot of Bad End 7, Bad End 8, etc. It's a horror/mystery game that's rarely all that scary or mysterious. The characters are fairly one dimensional as well, most of them, anyway. And the end result of everything is pretty absurd.  But I can't say I had a bad time 100%'ing it for a $2 investment"

The solution to that one was rather clever. The story had more meat than it initially let on. At first I was mistaken that the simularity to movie/books like The Ring that have to do with dying in a ficticious world leads to a real death would possibly suck some merit out of this game. Thankfully, that was not the case. While it has a simularity to those as I said it does it's own thing, and feels original in that regard. Finally, despite only being a few hours in length the personalities for the small cast of characters, and the tale itself is very well told, and had me gripped until the very end. This is done thanks to having a solid build up without taking too much time, and only dealing with a few characters within it's length rather than overbearing its' story with too many.

It's basically a visual novel inside a visual novel.The idea is really cool. The plot and story is in my opinion great and at some points a little surprising. Gameplay wise its a visual novel meaning you read and select choices. Not much more complicated than that.The characters are well drawn while the environments seem a little bit generic. The music suits the game in most cases.The spelling can be a little bit rough at times but still understandable and doesn't brake the game's feel much.The BAD ENDS are great. I recommend doing them all as some of the deaths are pretty well written.HOWEVER:To get to that good plot, pacing and investigation you need to survive about 40 minutes of PURE NOTHINGNESS. The first 40 minutes of the game is the introduction to the environment, scene and characters which is WAY TOO LONG for an introduction. They could have easily condensed this into 10 minutes MAX. This is mostly because the dialogue keeps repeating how you might die for real if you die in the game. Yes we get it for like the 15th time.I understand why a lot of people dislke or frown upon this game. It's because it takes way too long to get to the good stuff. The first 40 minutes are boring. Nothing else.VERDICT:I think this is a great visual novel with great plot and awesome mystery elements but gets dragged down by the stupid 40 minute intro that most people not bother with going through because its really boring.8/10"

It's not very helpful to play the English and Japanese versions side-by-side.

I mean,it's super cheap and may have a schlock value,but those are its only assets.The visualsare okay,but unremarkable. Character designs are pretty generic the scenery is just okay setpieces repeated a few times.The choice system is weak- the way to get bad ends becomes really obvious early on, which basically makes finishinf the game an utterly linear experience; they should have just made it a kinetic novel to be honest.The plot is essentially cohesive, but requires some stretches in conclusion and some leaps in judgment- the protag has tobelieve there's an actual killer video game WAY too early, for instance. I also feel like there should be more police presence than there is (there is essentially none).The characters are all pretty bland and uninteresting, there's really no reason to get attached to any of them, so there's little tension or reason to care if any of them die.I mean if you really want a cheap schlocky horror game this may be up your ally, but otherwise you can do better with your money."

In fact it's the laziest, spooky creepy ghost villain I have seen in a while.There's nothing interesting or scary about it,it's just a black creature who has the embodiment of a human.I feel like this was merely done to make the work easier for the developers,not having to create the actual monster.There's also a huge lack of character models for side characters.I also would like to point out how conceited the whole game feels. It's so self-aware.First you're kinda okay with it but after a while it just gets weird..You'll know what I mean once you play it.The soundtrack is decent and artstyle is alright. Neither of those certainly aren't bad.But nothing worth hyping about either. It's all pretty decent.I was also positively surprised about the text barely having any spelling mistakes,which is a pretty important thing considering this game doesn't have any voice acting.I was also rather pleased with the amount of decision making there was.So overall, the writing is pretty generic and stupid at times.Characters aren't very likeable and their actions are pretty abnormal,and reactions are unnatural and bizarre.Lack of character models.No voice acting, but has a decent soundtrack playing in the background.Artstyle is alright, but you might want to check some screenshots out before you purchase this.It's BARELY Horror.It's not the lengthiest game and certainly not the most well written but it's super cheap,so I'd tell you to go for it.It'll probably keep you busy for couple hours max.I'd buy it at full price but if you can get it on sale, that's even better but come on..It is dirt cheap.There's not much to lose with this one.I rate :4 spooky ghosts out of 10"

The horror aspect feels much lessened because of this and the dialogue scenes ,whilst very insightful and intertwined, can seem a bit long winded if you take the time to read everything, which you really do need to, even the opening scene links to the first level of the game.However, I am upvoting because I have never had such a HORRIFYING time trying to make the right decision in-game. It is well thought out and the feeling of incrementing consequence is ever-looming.Definantly worth a play fr those who enjoy a ""lighter"" japanese, indie horror game.See how we went here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKo3zSB6g_Y"

I expected to at least see some unusual death scenes but every bad end is basically the same scene of the character getting grabbed by a shadowy figure, or a ghost hand coming out of their phone screen. This would be okay if the story was at least good, however it's just mundane and repetitive. There's nothing interesting about this visual novel."

At the end of 2.5 hours, my first thought was ""Well, there goes 2 hours I'll never get back."" I very rarely say that about the game. That said, 2.5 hours isn't bad for a $2.00 price tag. But honestly it felt like they took what could have been a very interesting concept and watered it down into something else entirely.One big issue I had with the gameplay was that once you die, you either start over completely from the beginning of the entire game and have to hold down your mouse for literal ages (and re-choose from previous dialogues), or you have to start from where you left off at the last save point. The latter of these options still consists of holding your mouse down for ages.Speaking of the mouse thing, there is a LOT of dialogue. If you like reading, you might like it. I struggled with reading it all, but did, and while the story itself was okay, the scripts and playout in the end were not so much to my liking.This really comes down to personal taste and by all means, if you think you'll like it, you just might. I'm really on the fence about saying yay or nay and just out of that experience I had I have to go nay. But it's not a concrete thing. The game reminds me of Hell Girl in a sense, and that's why I feel it would have done well as an anime. But as a game, it left me looking for closure. And things without closure are hard to enjoy for me personally.It's not bad for what it is, it just isn't for everyone. I can't recommend it unless you're okay with a lot of reading, okay with backtracking when you fail, okay with holding down the mouse for long periods of time and repeating many scenes, or, alternatively, you're going for the achievements/cards/whatever and following a guide."

The top-rated review claims the game can be finished in one hour. This is complete BS."

I am very familiar with Visual Novels from Japan and I have played alot of them.This one in particular is just a port from Android/iOS Phones for Steam. I later realized this. However, The price point is set very well about how much this game is worthIt is pretty short, took me about 3 hours to get ALL endings, 1 hour for one playthrough to True End. So its better to get this on your phone and play it spurratically IMHO.-I Purchased this game because I am a huge fan of Survival Horror type games where the Protagonist is mutilated in a variety of interesting ways. This was rather lacking to what I'm used to.All the Bad Endings are mostly the same with little difference in what happens. Very Unoriginal Bad EndingsFor a game called BAD END, only the True end makes the game make sense lol-The BGM (Background Music) was very distracting in key scenes which were supposed to be scary with ""Happy Tones"".So calling this ""Survival Horror"" is kinda a joke.-There were very few Unique CGS, but considering the length of the game, understandable.-The plotbreaking the 4th wall and back again was entertaining at first, but was dragged on and on throughout the game.Personally I have enjoyed stories from Amatuer Visual Novelists better than this, but it was an okay way to spend an hour of life.-Best part of the game is the funny posts you can see in the Discussion community after you playI recommend you play other Visual Novels instead, usevndb.orgto find the genre you like best. Steam isn't really the best port for these types of games yet, but the 16:9 / Fullscreen Aspect Ratio was appreciated (Although you would get the same thing on your phone)If you really want to get this game, it is entertaining for about an hour or so, and I would get it on iOS/Android because of conveinence. Also it IS made to be a mobile game."

THERE IS ONLY ON GOOD CHOICE IN EVERY SCENARIO! and i don't mean that there is one clear good choice, i mean that there is ONLY ONE GOOD CHOICE NO MATTER HOW REASONABLE THE OTHER CHOICES ARE! once i figured this out, i completely lost all interest in this game because i knew that no matter what, there is only one way to go. There ain't no branching paths. There is only   one path that u hav to take or else u die. so in every section with the life or death choices, u r basically rolling dice to see if u die or not. If u r expecting a horror game where ur choices matter, u'll be deeply disappointed in this game."

Today I am bringing you a review of the indie Visual Novel/Choose Your Own Adventure BAD END. BAD END was devloped by Arai Koh Create Office and published by YOX-Project. It was released on Steam on 11/25/2015(NOTE: This was a review from a game in my own Steam library, it was NOT a key provided by the Developer and/or Publisher)Video Review:https://youtu.be/TK0jGYX7d4oThe ""Too Long, Didn't Watch"" Review:Maybe grab it for $1 as an intro to the Visual Novel style. It works better than you initially realize if you give it a chance.2/5 StarsThe ""Meat & Potatoes"" Review:OK, so I grabbed this for a buck and figured ""Why not?"" and let me tell you why you CAN. If you're new to the genre, or are of a younger audience even, this is certainly something to consider if you can grab it for a buck like I did. It is not too text heavy and the story is fairly easy to follow. The graphics are decent, but get repetitive. Same with the audio. Now, for a Visual Novel, you may need to ramp up the audio and video components more simply to avoid as much repetition. For a typical CYOA (Choose Your Own Adventure) however, there really isn't much need for graphics at all, so long as your story is engaging. I didn't think of this game so much as a CYOA until I explored it further and began branching out to more endings. As the story goes on, there is more choice (thought not a lot, it is a short game). The story itself (Horror) is quite formulaic, but still works out ok. So, in this gamers opinion, you'd need better story and more choices that branch out better.Why not, though? Well, frankly, $2 is just too much. It is only worth picking up at a dollar or less as it is just an average experience at best. None of the aspects of the game are horrible, but none are remarkable or significantly above average either.Just....meh.2/5Happy Gaming!!!"

You could get a few hours of gameplay before you finish it in its entirety. I'm a fast reader, so I got through it pretty quickly. I just went back and tried to find all the endings. You do get what you pay for though, but it's worth the buy. :)"

I am slowly coming to the conclusion that I don't like them much.But of all the visual novels that I don't like, this one isn't that bad. That's high praise by my 'Scale of VN okay-ness.'It's about a game that kills you if you die. You get to choose from different options in the game-within-a-game as you try to reach the end. Some of them are based on solidly established horror logic. This allows you to reason the correct answers some of the time. Others it appears to be more a game of guesswork. That would be my biggest criticism."
