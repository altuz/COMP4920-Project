,Recommended,415880,33507725,Posted: 13 July,all,Mr Monstr,"I've played the game for a while now but I couldn't really recommend it until now.Not too long ago the game on PC was pretty much dead, like 8 players peak.But now that doesn't matter since cross-play with PS4's been added. (PS4's always had a decent playerbase since it was free with PS+)Needless to say, with almost 300 hours I really enjoy this game. I think it's a really good casual-competitive game in a similar way to Rocket League. Arguably more balanced towards casual but undeniably still a great competitive game too.Also I can super recommend this game if you like playing with friends.Note: Although crossplay is there for public matchmaking. Cross-play is not available for private games but this is planned to be added."

,Recommended,415880,30387140,Posted: 8 March,all,Wizard Walrus,"Disc Jam is a simple concept very masterfully done; the developers have spared no expense with the advanced physics of the character's movements and the motion of the disc. It's a game that's easy to play, hard to master - with your understanding of the game increasing with every single match. It's somewhat addicting and you'll find yourself saying one more game often, it's fast-paced, fun and so intense. You'll wonder why you didn't pick it up sooner."

So, I have to queue for other regions which results in high ping and hence, can't enjoy the game.I recommend this game because I want many people to buy this game and play it. So, it reduces queue times."

It is simple to learn but with a deeper learning curve (a la Rocket League).  Very pure and arcadey fun that favours reflexes just as much as out-witting your opponent via positioning and tactics.Does exactly what it sets out to do and at a very fair price point.  The (very small) Dev team have also been active and communicative in the forums and have shown respect for their customers.Highly recommended!"

,Recommended,415880,33500504,Posted: 13 July,all,Hammertoes,"Since release, this game has added dedicated servers (enabling 2v2 matchmaking) and cross-platform play. I went from being unable to play with some of my friends through peer-to-peer to being able to find matches consistently within minutes.Mechanically, the game is incredibly fun and challenging. The push and pull of momentum in a match completely trumps any tennis or sports game I have ever played, thanks in part to the Juiced mechanic, which boosts your throw speed after three successive perfect throws. But don't miss a beat or you'll lose it! Maintaining your Juiced state while trying to make your opponent drop his is just half the fun.Landing perfect throws is precise and feels great, blocking and charging your Super is satisfying and returning opponents Supers, though tricky, feels amazing. Not to mention you can throw lobs, perform Wall Skips and even return an opponents Super with your own if you're fast enough. Super throws can also stack with your Juiced state. There's plenty of options in how to get an advantage but you always have the tools to counter them.Whilst there's only a few characters and currently one arena, the game feels like a cohesive whole as it is. High Horse clearly focused on having fun and engaging gameplay first and foremost. They also have more content planned but the fact that they focused on implementing dedicated servers and cross-platform play as soon as possible shows thier priorities are in order. I would even say it's above and beyond what should be expected for such a small studio. Kudos, HH."
,Recommended,415880,30375528,Posted: 7 March,all,TriTraTrouble,"I already played Disc Jam in the open beta and decided to host a members only f2p tournament for my clan, because the game itself provides great mechanics, simple controls, 1on1and2on2 based matches and lots of fun. My mates thought so too and we had an evening full of laughing, screaming and cheering. And even though it was in beta, no errors (or similar) occured.The atmosphere is like a mixture of Brawlhalla and Rocket League. There's not much to explain in terms of gameplay except:1. Throw that disc as fast, as hard and as tricky as you can.2. Catch.3. Retry.I can definitely recommend this game if you have a controller at hand... didn't play it with keyboard so I can't really say much about that."

,Recommended,415880,33466382,Posted: 11 July,all,Moonmadness,"Apparently this game had issues with the low player count. Well, the game just got the crossplay update and I'm glad to announce it is working perfectly! I get matches within seconds in EU+NA.About the game itself, well, as someone who played Windjammers when it was out on the arcades I find everything very familiar. I only had to adjust to a couple things like the perspective, the fact that you can get hit in the back if you don't face the right direction and the need to have a fully charged shield to get a super shot. Otherwise I'm just sliding and curving my disc as I was doing back in the 90s.The game could use more characters and a little more choice for super shots, but that's not really aggravating. A couple things I would really change though:- make the hitbox of the disc bigger when it bounces off to the ground - many times you're clearly below the disc yet you can't catch it- lower the startup on super shield or remove it entirely so that you have more chances for super shots. You basically can't get a single one unless they throw a disc at you in a straight line.It is a pretty fun multiplayer game once you get into it. Just beware that there are no single player modes whatsoever."

I don't think there's anything wrong with matchmaking.  I think there just isn't anyone playing.Mechanics are a little overcomplicated if you're coming from Windjammers but it's not hard to learn.Windjammers: one button to dash, knockup the disc, and throw. With a second to lob.Disc Jam: Throw button is block, have to charge the block to knock disc up for super. Lob button is also dash (which I think should be the other way around at least).There's an awkward delay after dashing to grab the disc so you can't get rid of it right away like you could in Windjammers.Curving is pretty easy in this. You can do slight left and right curves with one button press, or you can hit throw and rotate the controller or pad in quarter or half circle to curve it more. You don't rotate controller then hit throw. You gotta hit throw then rotate.There's only 4 goofy looking characters with minor stat differences and all 4 can have the same super moves.The bad cam angle makes it difficult to judge the disc path. I think it would be nice if they gave us the option of playing with a top down angle.If the game wasn't dead I would be playing it like a fanatic even with the few shortcomings, but with no community the game is pointless. Might as well stick with Crazy Power Disc or Windjammers for local multiplayer.Another thing I preffered with Windjammers and Power Disc is that you could volley almost indefinitely no matter how fast the disc gets. In this the playing field is quite large and it's easy to circumvent  your opponent."

It only took me half an hour to realize that no one plays this (at least not in the region I'm in) and would be getting games with outrageous pings.  The timing on some of the moves also need a little tweaking, and the way the game reads directional inputs can be wonky with a Steam Controller (everything else works great).There is also no set up for bot matches or anything, which would have saved the game for me.  I don't mind playing against AI, but the lack of even that option for people with few offline friends kinda kills it for me."

,Recommended,415880,31521901,Posted: 3 May,all,Varga,"Fun game that has that ""jump in and play"" play style. It can be addicting at times, especially if you have friends to play with/against.The biggest drawback is the price, playerbase and content.1) Wait for a sale2) Wait (?) for a bigger playerbase. This just comes with time but unfortunately the devs don't do a great job of promoting or advertising this game so it could be a while to get more people online.3) The lack of content. There are skins and taunts you can unlock by playing enough matches. By obtaining at least 1000 credits you are able to purchase something mysterious, as it is by a ""prize machine"" esque reward. The problem is that 1000 is too steep, as it takes around four matches to obtain, and this is difficult when there is no one to play with. Also, the content itself (skins/taunts) really aren't worth it. They don't add anything new to the game, with the skins just being different colors or slightly different patterns; and the taunts nobody uses except for MAYBE at the beginning and/or end of a match. Like I said before, really not worth going for new content.I've gotten on countless times and waited for a match to just be let down in the end because no one joins for over twenty minutes.TL;DR Fun game, buy on sale, but be warned that the playerbase is low at this time and the content is very limited."

A Frisbee disc/Action game hybrid.... but this isn’t just ultimate Frisbee, so put your putters away. This is Pong on steroids all ramped up with special moves, dives, and lobs shots! THIS is the vision Windjammers strived to be years ago, but revamped with the technology of the Unreal4 Engine.The goal of Disc Jam is simple. You take 2 players (or 2v2) on a court similar to a tennis court, and take turns throwing a frisbee at each other in an attempt to get it past your opponent to score some points. First to 50 wins a set, and a match is best of 3 sets. The gameplay is fast and frantic with diving, lob-shots, special moves, curve shots, guard plays and an arsonal of tactics and mechanics to keep each player guessing and keeping each new game fresh. And it’s always crazy when you throw out a special move, and your opponent catches it and shoots a special right back your way. I especially recommend this game for adrenaline junkies. There is always something exciting going down, and as soon as the match is over you just want that rush again. With frantically fast gameplay, easy co-op to comp, loads of unlockables, and  simple-to-learn-but-arduous-to-master style, you and your friends are going to have limitless amount of good times.  I give Disc Jam a well deserved 8/10, with room to grow"

Could just be me here on this one.Although it is cool that every prize is only 1000 XYZ (Forget what the item is called...credits maybe) I think this games prize component would greatly benefit if a player was able to choose from a list of prizes rather than pull an arm and hope for the best.

I played quite a bit, and even though i didn't get as much time as i would have liked during the beta, this game easily fell into my top 10 favorite games of all time at that time. When i heard the game was releasing soon, i was excited because i thought the playerbase would get bigger, because it was fairly hard to find many people in a game (eg. finding the same person 3 times within 5 games) and i thought the release would come with lots of publicity and more people to play with.Unfortunately, my predictions were completely wrong, because with the release came a dead game that is now abandoned by many players. Once i bought the game, I went straight into it, expecting at least a few people to easily find and then jump into the game I had loved. But low and behold, i sat for over 10 minutes trying to find a game, with literally nobody joining. I was very confused and sad, because I had loved this game, played a lot of it, gained different skins, discs, and taunts, met many people who were fun to play with and were friendly, and i got pretty good at it. I kept persisting, but never found any games with anyone to play with.Even with new additions of characters, skins, taunts, poses, discs, names, emblems, integration of deticated servers, crossplay with pc and ps4 (also its apparently free on ps4), ranked stats, and ""many more features to come"", the game is an absolutely dissapointment when it comes to the community. Because there is none.I VERY MUCH want to give this game a recommendation, and if anyone reading this wants to re-ignite the community spark that was once in this game, be my guest and buy this game, if you have any friends to play it with, or if you would like to try to contribute to keeping the community alive. It is very, very fun and is easy to get into and hard to master. But for the time being, i cannot give this game a recommendation rating, because i spent 15$ on this game and found that it was a waste of my time and money, because nobody seems to care about or has forgotten about this game. A piece of advice for the devs; try lower price, more publicity, and more content (i know you guys are working hard, but i dont know if it's enough) and MAYBE your game will grow substantially. I do think that those who seem to think the game seems fun and those that wish to buy this game should. But be warned that you are most likely buying a dead game with no player base.I truly hope this game can once again regain it's charm, and bring back the playerbase so that everyone can enjoy this.TL;DR: Very fun, but no playerbase, basically a dead game. Buy if you want, expect nobody to find in matchmaking."

But unless the developers decide to expand their (2 man) team i doubt they can produce the content necessary to keep people interested.Despite that i dont regret my purchase one bit, like i said its fun.If you can get past the fact that the que times are a tiny smudge longer than your average competetive online game. You can have a blast throwing discs with your friends and literally explode the opposition out of the court."

,Recommended,415880,30506881,Posted: 14 March,all,Johnny Rico.,"Really fun game and quite addictive once you get the controls down. I wouldn't recommend playing this with keyboard as it can be quite tricking picking and choosing your shots using the keys.The art style is funky as well as the music and the loot system drops every 3 matches or so. This game is nothing like Rocket League, the only comparison is that it's from a relatively unknown dev team.This is a new game with only 2 devs bringing this to life, and it's already really good. I can see the potential for further content similar to how Psyonix (Rocket League) bring in new maps & games modes each season.This game will blow up once it gets fully dedicated servers and an efficient competitive game mode.8/10 would recommend.Pros;Fun & differentResponsive controlsCool audio effects and musicCons;Dedicated servers should be the next port of callQueue times could be quicker or matches should have more sets to last longerThe matchmaking can be a little ropey sometimes"

Isn't a problem for me since I have a group of friends to play it with, however, its big problem (at the time of writing) is that you can't earn unlocks playing private games. What we've done to get around that so far is just join matchmaking at the same time and (so far) it puts us with each other, but as our skill ratings change, this isn't going to work forever.Other than that, it's just good fun.

,Recommended,415880,33558644,Posted: 15 July,all,Aye Mate,"I tried the game while it was/is free for the weekend. I have played about 8 hours non-stop and am loving the competitive side of it. Hopefully the developers take the ranking system seriously and professionally and I could see this game being a solid 1V1/2V2 competitive game.The game is extremly fast paced and can be played easily by anyone, but requires fast reactions and a lot of game knowledge to master the art.With all this being said, there are a couple of cons to be mentioned.The first and most annoying thing to most PC players is the controlls. I use an Xbox controller so the controls work well for me but I have read a fair amount of complaints about the issue.The game skins are a bit gimicky and its quite cartoonish.Otherwise this game is great fun.

PONG.Devs say Tennis but nah I don't believe , in Tennis the ball can hit the ground...not in Disc Jam. Le Disc cannot touch the floor.I will keep this review the point.  Watch my broadcasts when I play (often) and see for yourself.-  I play on PC ,  I played the game on a Free weekend, bought it for 8 $ cnd, it was half off.-  I have 22 hours on this game at this time. I will have 30 hours by the weekend. It's monday.-  I've played   181  matches so far.   Game tracks stats  :)Pros- Game is based on Skill. You play, you learn, you get better.    You  do  NOT  buy anything whatsoever that gives you an edge.It is purely skill based. You have no ability trees, no points to add, you just learn how to play and play.  Get better and learn.- There is NO CASH SHOP at the time of this review. I've not seen anything indicating otherwise.- You  DO unlock asthetic stuff like costumes etc.  Cool stuff to unlock, tags, emblems, disc models (look only) Pts from playing.- The developer is active on Steam.- Very good server match making!  I wait from 1 second  to  60 seconds at all times for Singles Matches  US East / US West / Europe Queue.  Hosted by Amazon Webservices, I queue for all 3 regions and no lag.#Let's take a sec talk about Lag. There are some Discussions about it, some users say to experience such lag they cannot play.- Out of   181  matches   I have had  lag in  3   -  7  matches.  I do not remeber how many but it wasn't more than 10.The lag in these approx 5 matches was not bad, the disc would,  sometimes,  twitch a foot closer or farther away.After having spoken to 7 players in game, they too have not experienced much lag, the game very rarely has any.OUT OF   181  Matches,    Only   3   to   7   matches  had lag.#- The game tracks a TON of STATS!  Matches played, Overall rank, Individual shot type ranking (curve, perfect, super, lobs),Win %  and a lot more!   You can split it from PC to Global view (cross platform). I'm currently  97th in Lobs on PC.  #selfbump-  IT HAS CO-OP!    IT   HAS   CO-OP!         I've played approx 15-25  Doubles matches,    INCREDIBLE FUN! Especially on Skype.- Excellent stress relief====Cons- PC players are strongly recommended to use a controller. If you have an Xbox, plug the remote into the PC, if you have a PS3 / PS4 there is legal, safe software online that you can install to make those remotes work with PC games. Google is your friend.** I played a good 20 matches with keyboard and while it was fun, with controller, it felt much more natural, optimised.**- Only  1  level.  While the game works really well with the 1 map and it really doesn't  need more maps for it to function..BUTBUTBUTFor my eyes, I'd like more courts with different styles. They can be essentially the same thing but a different look or style would be nice.I cannot think of any other Cons.==Now my last point!- Full price is 16.99 CND (canadian)  I'm torn with the price. The game is really fun and is worth the price I paid of 8 $  cnd (canadian)   It is worth the price I paid, at 16.99, it is worth it, once being informed of the pros / cons.Which is why I'm writing this review, to inform you of my point of view after playing 22 hours of the game since buying it 1 month ago.Read this review and watch the gameplay videos, I believe you'll enjoy it!I recommend this game 10/10"

,Recommended,415880,30486698,Posted: 13 March,all,Tahit | Amajorseven,"Disc Jam is a solid competitive game, and can be a lot of fun to play! It's easy to pick up, and hard to master. There are a number of characters, skins, emblems, name tags, and discs to choose from. However, as of right now, the amount of content is pretty limited.Here's why:After going through the basic and advanced tutorials, if you're playing alone, there is nothing to do except for free play, and customising your character. The playerbase is small meaning it can take a very long time to find a match online. There is no option to enable bots for offline play, and, in doubles, teams are required to be balanced regardless.Do I recommend Disc Jam? Definitely yes if you have others to play with. If you're playing alone, then it can get a little boring after a while. That's mostly because this game is underrated and needs a bigger playerbase.It's still a new game so hopefully the devs can add some new features in future updates."

If they introduced a singleplayer mode, say challenges or AI, then I can get onboard with that.As for aesthetics, the faces for the characters are fixed which adds a lack of reality to this especially when it's made with Unreal Engine 4.tl;dr I don't think that at this point the game is up to par in its current state, but it is barely out of release.I wish nothing but the best for the devs because they have created a diamond in the rough."

There's a solid learning curve with good controls, but nothing felt ""fun"" or ""exciting"" about practicing the way it does with Rocket League. To compare it to another ""league,"" Lethal League's twitchy back and forth was way more engaging to me. Decent overall, but I doubt enough people besides a niche group are going to care to keep multiplayer going."

Unplayable over 150ms as you cant see the disc. Big waste of time joing a US West game, massive epic fail and guaranteed loss.

Even an offline game if they had bots with difficulty levels would be cool when you cant find an opponent.

The game is so intuitive and fun to play, and anyone can pick it up and become a veteran with practice (it's that easy to pick up, but difficult to master).With single player mode, you only have free play mode available. Although it's great for practice, the small player base makes it very difficult to play this game online right now. What I am truly hoping for is that the developers find some way to spread the game around and grow the player base. This game deserves a lot more recognition, and it would be a huge shame if it didn't grow any further."

The only downside I've found for this game so far is that it has a small playerbase... This does make it difficult to find matches sometimes. I've only been in one doubles match, but I generally don't have much trouble playing a singles match during peak hours of the day. I wouldn't let the small playerbase deter you; If no one takes the leap to buy it, people will never be able to enjoy it.That being said, you may wanna wait for a sale, and I'd definitely insist that the developers put this game on sale to boost the player base and make people more likely to buy it in the future."

Who has the time to wait for a match all night long? Not me.The devs dont quite understand apparently how frustrating this is. There is no single player mode so there is nothing to do while you are waiting and waiting and waiting! But the Devs keep saying dont worry something is in the works!Do yourselves a favor and save your money. Not even close to being worth the cost.

,Recommended,415880,30549452,Posted: 16 March,all,mitspieler,"** Edited to recommended **This is a perfect example of a game that should've been Early Access. The price was too much for what you got, I think it's fine now.The game is cool. You play 1v1 or 2v2 frisbee on steroids. Some might remember Windjammers from the past. It's essentially the same. You can dash around and do special throws with street fighter like inputs. Four different characters have their own values for speed, throw strength, etc and you can unlock costumes, tags, yadda yadda.The only thing you can do is play online or practice throwing the disc at a wall. With a patch they added support for dedicated servers. Also, crossplay with PlayStation users is planned and hopefully arrives sooner than later. Meanwhile a system for skillbased matchmaking is in play and gets constantly tweaked and improved.The game is fun. Bought it with a friend and we have a blast playing 2v2. There are issues though and this needs a bit more polish. But they are working on it. Many people compare it to Rocket League, feels more like SARPBC for now. I recommend it for the potential and the effort already done. There is a constant stream of updates and improverments.tl;dr+ windjammers+ online/couch coop+ fast skillbased game+ short matches- prize- no real offline ""vs bots"" play"
