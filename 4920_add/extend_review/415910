,Recommended,415910,20940735,"Posted: 3 February, 2016",all,Note,"This game is a really cool take on Chess. Instead of battling another opponent, you instead have to use rooks, knights, and bishops to stop an infinite horde of pawns in a turn-based manner, just like Chess! The game get very tricky later on when using special powers or reviving pieces and it's a cool game to play if you have free time. Gigachess is definitely worth taking a look at if you like Chess.And if you have no one to play chess with you. ._."

It's a little raw, a little glitchy around the menu and screen resizing leaves a lot to be desired (loss of cursor), and an exit confirmation would be nice instead of an instant drop to desktop when hitting Escape........ BUT ...... the game itself is good . Deviously tricky in some of the puzzles, and nice and relaxing playing in Endless mode.All in all, it's enjoyable and that makes it well worth the modest price if you're looking for something a little *different*.*edit* The devs are quick to respond and iron out any flaws, my minor grievances have already been addressed and it's playing very well."

Be warned, though, if you want a game where you get to solve chess match puzzles, you might be disappointed."

,Recommended,415910,26637960,"Posted: 16 November, 2016",all,Zozoken,"GigaChess is a game I found pretty cheap that I thought was going to be some sort of chess variant. Instead, it is an action / puzzle game that feels a lot like tower defense. The overall mechanics, powers, and enemies in the game are deceptively simple, so even if you don't know anything about chess, it is still easy to learn and play. There is an ""endless"" mode, where you try to go as long as you can, and a ""puzzle"" mode, which I haven't tried yet but if the tutorial is any indication, should be a lot of fun.Chess players beware. There's some mechanics in the game that you may overlook because you are thinking about the game as if it were chess. For example, you can move past your own pieces as well as enemy pieces, something that wouldn't be possible in a chess game.I probably won't play very much of this game, but I still recommend it. The developer has made a very solid game here. I recommend playing either on Novice difficulty to pass the time, or playing on a difficulty that challenges you, or else you might get bored of this game."
,Recommended,415910,30988099,Posted: 6 April,all,Chebyshevrolet,"Puzzle game with chess elements.  It's like chess in that you have knight, bishop, and queen pieces, you try to capture enemies pawns, and you need to think ahead, but the similarities to chess end there.  It's a fun puzzler with multiple modes and mostly challenging achievements.  The dev has been quite active lately and the recents updates and additional game modes and achievements have made the game A LOT better. I keep getting all the achievements and the dev keeps adding more!Definitely recommend this game even at full price (which is only $4)."
,Recommended,415910,24767225,"Posted: 7 August, 2016",all,SeraphicReaper,"Solid game. I wish that the menu music was an option out of the 3 during-game music options available, it's the best of them all. Only con is the music, which can be turned off.Fair warning to those excited to see a steam game related to chess: It's more of a puzzle game than a chess game. Even still, fun game that can be picked up and played for 5 or 50 minutes at a time.------------------------------------------------2nd review as of May 7th, 2017: More recommendedProps to Drixxel, the developer. I chose to come back and play this game a bit today, and there have been some significant amount of UI-friendly and (positive) gameplay changes. The game is more polished. Music/Audio options, more advanced rules (at least within endless mode). I'm surprised by how few people there are considering the fair amount of content and rewarded quality that was put into the game's update.With the updated changes, I want to reiterate that this is more of a puzzle game with chess-like mechanics than a chess game with puzzling boards. Nonetheless, there is an overlap and the game makes for a nice occassional pickup and play game."

76561197972465191,Not Recommended,415910,29512985,Posted: 26 January,all,Cvphilo,"I really thought I would like this. I like chess, puzzle games, and chess puzzles. But this feels like annoyng work (to someone who likes the aforementioned), not fun for me.I am not saying there is anything wrong with the game. It is as advertised. There is just something about it that does not sit right with me. Trying to put my finger on it, I think it is the combination of moving attackers and puzzles that demand perfection (or close to it). For me the former makes me feel like I should be able to run-and-gun a bit, if you see what I mean, but you actually have to get everything just right like with chess or Hexcells. Not that I can't -- I used to be a very good chess player, which of course requires planning that includes opponent's moves. But somehow it does not come together for me.Obviously some people like it a lot, and that is great. I always like to see games enjoyed. So this is just me. I am just advising that if you say ""I love chess and puzzle games"" that does not mean for sure that you will like this."

,Recommended,415910,34729915,Posted: 4 September,all,dlogspilk,"It started good. A new twist to the classic chess game but overall I would not recommend buying this game unless you get it on sale.The game itself is pretty fun and challenging at the same time but the way the pieces are made is a huge problem for me in this game. Althogh the pieces are shown what moves are available, the issue for me lies between the controls (xbox controller) and the design of the pieces. It would be a more enjoyable experience for me if I had the ability to tell my pieces apart as well as a toggle to keep the enemies next move on the screen. If these two issues are fixed in future updates I will change my review to a recommend after I play a few games.edit: after noticing the updates that took place only after a few hours after my initial review, i would highly recommend this game. Still a few things that could be updated as far as the interface goes and the controls could be a bit better but overall I know the developer is solo working hard to improve this game and make it more enjoyable than it already is. Please leave feedback on any issues you encounter and if your luck is as good as mine the dev will make your experience a much better one than before! I will be looking for more projects by this team."

To sum up developer's answers and my second thoughts:- UI/UX IS actually good and very thought about but you have to be persistent to uncover all it's capacity (still hard to grasp).- Graphics to the taste and definetly not mine.- Gameplay IS boring: everything happens on a plain 8x8 chess board, you have only one type of enemy - pawn (with a kind of different breed) and a pair of strategic elements: block for one square and a bomb.Can recommend only to hardcore chess and similar games' lovers."
