Here are the controls, which are not at all mentioned in game:WASD to move around, use the mouse to look aroundarrow keys for tank controls, where U and D move forward and back while L and R rotateESC to exit the gameR to restart the gamespace to jumpleft click to attackhold control to crouchhold shift to runWhen you click the black box under ""start"", the game will freeze. Don't worry, it is just loading. There is no loading screen.Basically all this is is a physics sandbox. There are objects which you can push around without any purpose to it at all.There is not much more that can be said about this game. There's not much variety, like in the similar game Goat Simulator. it would not take you very long to count every single object in the game. The fact that this game is not in early access is astounding. The developers have released it on steam as a full game. There have been games made in 48 hour game jams with more content than this. I'm not trying to be funny, I mean that literally. It takes less than a minute to walk across the entire map.It's like someone was just playing around with the Unreal game engine and decided to charge money afterwards for nothing. Even after being off of steam for several months, very little has changed. I'm disappointed that this got approved to be on steam - twice. Please keep in mind that if you play the game for under 2 hours, you can get a refund through steam's refund system. You can choose ""I didn't like this game"" as the reason, the refund will be approved."

,Not Recommended,415950,19138457,"Posted: 17 November, 2015",all,The Red Menace,"You should know that ALMOST EVERY positive review on this game is a joke.There is no way you can customize your controls. You can't see any options, so you have to guess on the controls. The starting screen is bland and only consists of two buttons ""start"" and ""exit"". the buttons are only black rectangles with the words above them.The game world is dull and REALLY small. It's dullness made it feel like I was in a dystopian world. But not the dystopian worlds you see in books, movies, and other games. This world has no wonder in it. And the map is so small that you can see everything in less than a minute.The parkour only consists of pressing the space bar, and you hardly ever even go to where you want your character to go. The ""physics"" are horrible. Last time I hit someone, they didn't go flying into the wall and get stuck in it while glitching out. And there is really nothing to do in this game besides headbutt things for no reason. you feel no sense of achievement from doing anything. 90% of the time, my game lags like crazy simply because of the girl's hair flying all over the place.The graphics are bad too. I could probably play this on my Atari.On the upside, there is a♥♥♥♥♥♥shaped bush on the sidewalk.But no, this isn't worth the $5 it's asking for. I wouldn't even get it if it were free."

I've already requested a return, though, and steam won't let me play it unless I buy it again, so I'm going to leave this for other folks as a record of my 'retard' experience with this game. Perhaps watching a youtube video on it to see what all you could do would have helped."

It's pretty much a barren world with a few boxes here and there and some people walking around.There's no score keeping, no missions, no objectives, no instructions, barely even any objects to interact with.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkzHvjcHp8UMovement is really good except jumping can be a bit frustrating.The graphics are good, but there are no options.Controller support works great, but there's no option to invert Y-axis, so us people who have been playing invert style since Nintendo 64 will be forced to use the keyboard and mouse.If you press the escape key the program shuts down immediately, shows you how much effort they put into it.So far I have played it for 20 minutes and seen a few humans walking around and some wooden boxes.  This game is a barren wasteland.  If I find out that there is more than just a couple streets to walk on, I'll reconsider my review.  If there were a half dozen different maps this size and you could warp between them or have mod support like Goat Simulator does, this might actually be a really good game.  But for now there's nothing to see.  Needs a lot of work in order to be considered a game."

You can explore the whole map in less than five minutes. There is also a very limited set of items. The discription of the game in the about the game section says that the  physics engine is buggy, and that is completely true. Because of this I hope they will add more to the game and it will become better. The game does not even have an options menu or a control list I asume they will add more as there is more to the game. I would enjoy the game if there was more to it, but for now I would say not to buy it. Wait for more updates to come out before you get it. The reasoning for my thumbs down is the lack of content, but when it gets more content this game has the potential to be a good game."

,Not Recommended,415950,19144172,"Posted: 18 November, 2015",all,Niaouli,"Now, before we begin, I have to point out that I'm a long-time little girl, doing my best to become as littlegirlish as it is technically possible, and while I understand I might not be completely correct, I know I am about right.I know and understand the need for a little girl simulator, and I am very glad that it at least tried to come to reality. However, if it at any point was successful, it wasn't Yohjo Simulator.This game lacks about everything a little girl shall possess and be able to do, everything a little girl should surround herself (or be surrounded) with. The world she has access to is a small, urban location. A few streets and alleys near the center of a city, not even a pretty one. It's filled with unsignificant trash, which happens to be her only toys. If us little girls want to do anything at all, we have to push crates and planks, or jump on a table, because the only thing, other than those, that we can interact with are people. And we don't want to interact with them, because then they turn into ragdolls and are thrown far away by the power of our heads.The game's location, in context of little girls, is completely out of place. Of course, little girls and toys is a good general idea, but why play with building materials (and only them)? Why is the only thing our little girl is able to do a headbutt?My theory is that the author played too many Goat Simulator, or whichever other maymay crap. I don't want it behind my loli escapist stone walls.Those walls surround an evergreen grassland with a wooden house somewhere in the middle, a pond to the side, and huge garden, where all the prettiest flowers are growing, the friendly animals are hanging out, and the naked men are hiding in the bushes. Looking, but not touching, and not being able to be touched.While japanese school outfits are a good start for this kind of game, wearable apparel should in no case be limited to just one, a gym outfit. There are so many things a little girl can put on herself, from frills to lace, and in everything she looks great. A terrible display, when you can't even flatter a loli's body with pretty clothes in a game about being a loli.There is much more to life than beating things with your forehead. There's no happiness coming from that. A game about little girls should bring people happiness, and what's a better choice to achieve that than cuddling? Imagine laying on a soft blanket with your fluffy little fox friend, cuddling lovingly. Jumping, out of nowhere, on your online loli buddy, tickling her near death. When she has no energy to fight back left, hug her tightly and don't let go. And then eat a cake, hungry from playing around. The default action a little girl should perform is cuddling, not hitting. As an example, of course, as there are many more activities that bring people happiness.I can imagine someone telling me otherwise, that pain makes them feel good, and let me tell you why I don't care - it's a game where you self-insert as the purest being known to man, not a guy whose name is not important."

The game is just another copy of Goat Simulator that targets otakus and weeaboos ... and lolicon. I ran around the map for a whole 7 minutes, jumped around and drop kicked several of the constantly respawning old men and found that it was only funny the first 4-5 times. The dancing men on the rooftop stole the entire show of the game as the only really funny thing on it, and even then it wasn't that funny. Truthfully a waste of $5, you're better off buying Goat Simulator and modding it to look like Yohjo Simulator.At first, I wont lie, it looked pretty decent considering how lovely Unreal Engine looks. But it wont take you very long to realize that everything in the game is absolutely awful and the game is just another click bait that a company released to waste your time. Don't worry, you still have a chance here; if you played for under 2 hours REFUND IT. You will soon see that the $5 you spent are happier sitting in your steam wallet or bank account."

No, I didn't buy this game because 'hurr cute little girl hurr I sit around in my basement all day being a slovenly weeb hurr' like everyone condescendingly presumes, because they're obviously the paragon of humanity themselves.I bought it because it looked like a total joke of a game, a garbage Goat Simulator rip-off, and that's what I was expecting and that's what I got. I thought that it could at least provide me with SOME chuckles.Spoilers, it didn't come close. I don't recommend this game even jokingly. I'm waiting for my refund right now, and I only played 4 minutes of this...'game'.Pros+ It's kind of funny smacking random pedestrians and watching them fly.+ The parkour feature is decent and interesting to a fault.Cons- There is no options menu whatsoever. Want to lower the volume of the quite frankly terrible soundtrack? You can't. Want to change graphic settings? You can't. Want to figure out what the controls are? You. Cannot.- It lags terribly. I don't know if it's just because my laptop is not built specifically for games, but it's not like I lag on every game or something. What is this game even exactly trying to load? One godawful, small map that you can fall out of full of robots that you can smack around and that's it.- Why didn't I just buy Goat Simulator on sale?VERDICTThis game is simply an inferior Goat Simulator in almost every way as I've already mentioned, missing everything that made the game fall into the 'weird but funny' catagory.

The future updates were said to included content such as new maps, new costumes, improved “parkour” even a School Life simulator update.However, I own both versions of the game, and as of the date of this review none of these updates have been implemented in either the Steam or non-steam versions of the game. You should consider that these updates are behind schedule before buying this game.I think the game is fun and the idea, albeit perhaps not the implementation, is cute. The game has also gained attention for being a victim of censorship. So I think the game was worth the buy, its cheap and has the potential for improvement.
