76561198042526657,Not Recommended,416060,31413213,Posted: 28 April,all,the_immortal,"Well. What can i say about this game.Visuals/atmosphere/sound: 5/5.Controls: 0/5That's probably it. The game by itself is something Fallout'ish / Deus ex like, but it's got completely different game mechanics.  It's all real time. You control character by mouse only. No tactical time stop, no bullet time. And i should say - the controls are STIFF. It takes an eternity before character starts to do what you want it to do. And that what gives this game it's difficulty. Your ability to react in combat is significantly limited. This turns every combat in to a roulette. If you're lucky enough, you can bring down a bunch of enemies and don't get a scratch. It not - you are dead. However - you have stuff to mitigate it - active abilities. But they have really beefy cooldown times. Now multiply that by: no saves through the mission, not even on game exit, no checkpoints. You died - you start it over. And missions are pretty big if you do all the side stuff. Add limited supplies. So your win strategy is: run into bunch of enemies, use cooldowns. Wait for cooldowns to reset. Repeat. That makes game reeeally hardcore.So at a time i have pretty mixed feelings about this game. Visuals are really good. Combat is actually satisfying. It's got a lot of RPG in it, and i really like RPG. But difficulty through controls is really killing most of the fun for me. A good example of great indie cyberpunk/RPG is Dex. And that game is not easy either. But the big difference - it is really responsive. I actually enjoyed playing it. And it's really sad about this game. It has really big potential in it. Fix controls, add saves/checkpoints - 5/5."
,Recommended,416060,32962748,Posted: 28 June,all,Redrusty66,"Fantastic isometric title. The dark and quasi cyberpunk atmosphere is very alluring. The story is familiar in one way or anotherm There are over 12 billion people and not enough usable fresh water for them. The global corporation, SICON, is in charge of what's left, and the world isn't happy about it. You take control of one of three mercenaries for hire and carry out various paid missions concerning SICON, usually by shooting everything in sight. This game does need serious control-work. It's the only thing really about the game that causes any distress at all, and casn on oocasion steal a bit of your joy. You can see many complaints in the reviews, almost all of them about this one issue. I would hope the developers are smart enough to get off their asses and do something about, if they would, this game could go down in iconic history as one of the best of its genre.I found it both smooth and bugkess (That I noticed anyway), plenty of room for immersion and scratches pretty much every isometric itch I have. Very good price for a game of this level of quality, if oyu are into the genre.  If you're a fan of any of the relvant genres, ARPG, isometric, quasi-top down-ish, fallout-style shorters...ect,ect. This is certianly a game you should have in your library."

,Not Recommended,416060,31475835,Posted: 30 April,all,JoswaR,-Stiff akward controls.-Basiclly have to run up on enemies to shot them because you can only see 20 feet any direction.-Stealth is just walking slowly.-No view cones on enemies to see where they are looking (First mission you have to sneak past a camera but I have no idea where the camera is looking because I can't see far enough and there isn't a view cone).- NO Saving! I'm fine with not having automatic checkpoints but i should atleast get quick saves/loads.This game has the potential to be something good but they need to fix alot before it gets there. I do love the graphics and atmostphere of the game but as of now that is it.

Actually, i cant even tell what this game is. For an Action game it is way to slow and static, for an arpg you have way to few skill choices and build possibilities and for a stealth game .. well, almost no stealth mechanics. Dont know, maybe because my expectations were a diablo like game, but i couldnt stand to play this game for longer than 30 mins. Maybe after a few Patches and when the dev decided what this game should be i give it another try. Right now: no recommendation and refund requested. Sorry :/"

They just can't use their hands. Anyway, this is a pure combat game where you kill tons of enemies and it can get somewhat challenging even on easy if you get caught in an alarm with goons rushing at you in endless waves (it does help to level though). Hard is well hard and you gotta replay entire levels when you die.***!!!***Additional note for for people who only have use of their 1 hand. You can easily play this title with 1 hand only just using 2 fingers without losing fluidity of control over your character. This is how I play this game.Great game, buy it!"

Not the best story but a good one enough to get you start.Many negative reviews are before the developers include the ability save in game any time. Look for the reviews after May 7 to decide if you want to try the game or not."
,Recommended,416060,34246655,Posted: 14 August,all,Deacon Syre,"It's good but I found myself fighting the controls and the camera a lot. You need to click (repeatedly) on an enemy to shoot them but the mouse pointer is so small and basically the same color as the world so I kept losing it when things got hot. Even at 1920x1080 I was having trouble spotting the items in the world you could pick up (which you need to do to survive and complete quests).I felt the stamina system was a waste and just meant I had to waste time waiting for a bar to refill while I'm trying to explore a map. I guess it's meant to stop you from kiting or something. I dunno.The stealth mechanic works excellent, so I spent most of my time walking to take full advantage of it, only running when I needed to escape or cover uncontested ground.I've only tried pistols and assault rifles so far and enjoyed them both. I think the rocket barrage skill or whatever that the cyborg starts with is messed up. The rockets travel at like walking speed. So, by the time you realize you're jammed up, launched them, and they've travel whatever distance you put between you and the enemies (which should be healthy to avoid rocket damage) I've lost more health than if I had just popped any other skill and mowed them down.I haven't played enough to tell if putting points into skill cooldown reduction makes a good dent because the skill cooldowns are loooong.All in all, I'm glad I got it and I might come back."
76561198083871385,Recommended,416060,34480914,Posted: 25 August,all,Seandginley,"I don't typically review my titles, but I noticed in the comments section this game is getting a lot of criticism that I feel is misleading. In the negative reviews, it keeps coming back to two features:1) The movement system is bad2) The game (or some aspect of it) is too hardSo here's the thing, the movement system isn't BAD, it's just different... very different to a point where it feels weird when you first start playing. That is not inherently a flaw though... I'd say I found League of Legends use of right clicking more unintuitive, and certainly harder to adjust to. Really, it's pretty simple, you just need to het the hang of it... Mouse scroll up to run and down to walk, click to move-to, holded shift to stop or alt to crouch to switch your mouse clicks to aim and fire rather than move-to. That's really all there is to it, for all reviewers keep ranting about how awful it is. I think I basically adjusted after 20 minutes. No, there is no cover mechanic, the idea is you walk to approach in stealth if that's your plan, or just run around a corner and get firing if not. You can abandon a fight and run back around a corner (or down a hall!) if you want to stick and move (it is useful for healing, admittedly, but usually the idea is whether because you dash in suddenly guns blazing or tiptoe in unheard, your statedy is close distance and mow the bad guys down.As for difficulty, the game actually isn't hard per say, rather it just doesn't hold your hand. The tutorial is brusqe (because who likes long tutorials?) and from there, the game expects you to really use the info it gave you, pay attention to your UI, and figure out the details of what information you have and what you're able to do via observation and expeirmentation. The closest I'll come to saying it's ""hard"" is that these are skills an experienced gamer is much more likely to have... but it's like knowing enough to look at the deeper menus of a game like Final Fantasy Tactics or Disgaea with the comprehension that if the devs put it there, there's information worth knowing. If you use all the info and tools the game gives you, it's really not hard at all.A good example is ""There's so many enemies, not enough ammo"". Initially I had this same problem, but realized it's because I was missing most of the item drops because they're very hard to see in the game... that said, you don't NEED to see them, your map displays all of their localation of every item in the zone you haven't gotten yet... just follow it around to collect them all, and you should have plenty of ammo... but you can sneak past foes or do melee takedowns on lone targes it will help too.All in all, the game is differnet, interesting, and pretty fun, you just need to learn to play. Consider it despite the nay-sayers if it sounds fun, at least for  a sale price"
76561198013328690,Recommended,416060,34300984,Posted: 16 August,all,rasabt,"This is sorta a iso-shooter-arpg, with many mechanics reminding one of games like old-school-Diablo (skill-progression, loot, controls) just with guns. But there is a lot more to it: the game realy captures this cyberpunk/distopian-flair and the guns sound and feel great (from miniguns, to snipers and assault riffels, etc. ). The knockback-value most of your and your enemy attacks have makes it feel less spammy more like a tactical shooter; simply running into a pack of 3-4 swat-members will only get your character riddled with bullets and thus staggered ...but the very same goes for enemies aswell. Once you get used to the shooting the game is great fun.All 3 chars share the same skill-tree, but start with different starter skills; skills range from more (specific) gun-damage special effects to more damage when kneeing and less stagger, a shield , homing rockets...there's decent stuff here and some possibilities to play around with.The game mostly consists of straight foreward (small) missions, very rarely you will find npcs with sidequest or traders. The story is nothing to write home about, but it works and there's also quite good voicework here.What makes this game very unique is the quality of animations, the art-style and the amazing soundtrack, aswell as the gun-play.Don't expect some big-publisher-esque-level of content or polish, but the game is very enjoyable for what it is."

It still needs some polish, especially at the controls but its all in all a good game worth playing. Had a lot of fun mowing down enemies.For the developer, who seems to still working to improve this game, I would recommend some beta reader for the English script as it has some errors that seem very odd though it managed to get the meaning across to the player. Some improvements for enemy AI(you can mow down just about anything if you have a decent shotgun and wait for enemies to come to you at a corner, may be enemies who throw grenades to flush players out of cover?) might be good to keep the players on their seats. Also a lack of good tutorial is something the developer might want to address. I get that it is pretty simple point and shoot game but still, the tutorial for new players is important and should be well thought-out."

,Not Recommended,416060,34335415,Posted: 18 August,all,Absolut,"Isometric game that wants to be a mix of Deus Ex and Syndicate classic. I generally like this kind of game. The graphics are good, animation and sound is good, the maps are large and the story is okay.What's not good are the clunky controls. Left click to move, left click to shoot, left click your gun to reload. It ends up playing like a turn based game where you stand and shoot instead of an action RPG where movement is important. Westboro just isn't much fun."

It reminds me a bit of the old Syndicate game set in a CyberPunk type, corporations rule the world way.  The English is a little rough.  That is to say, it's about 99% understandable, but also fairly obvious that it was translated by a non-speaker.  The game is pretty unforgiving when it comes to combat, even on Easy difficulty.  As far as I can find, there's no pause or anything when fighting.  And if you get tag teamed by 2 or 3 guys, you're probably going to die, at least at the start (this is not a negative in my opinion -- that's they way it should be).A few things I don't like so far:1.  You can quick save, but you can't get to a main menu screen unless you quit out of the game.  That's pretty bad.2.  There's no tutorial at all.  There are a few helpful boxes that pop up, but they're not all that great.  Spend some time looking at the controls before you start playing.3.  I realize it's cyberpunk, but the world is basically monotone (gray).  Skills and map are colored, but still not enough to liven things up much.I'll keep you posted on my 2nd and 3rd impressions after I play for a few hours and get some experience with it."
,Not Recommended,416060,34363659,Posted: 19 August,all,SandTrout,"This game comes across to me as incomplete. The format and powers imply an isometic ARPG, but it's stingyness with ammo and lack of a ""merchant"" mechanic imply that you should be playing a stealth survival game, but even then, the stealth mechanics, while present, are not robust. The contol scheme isn't especially forgiving of the ARPG combat style either, and the camera is obnoxiously limited.It might be worth the price on a heavy sale, but it is unfortunately not even worth its base price IMO."

I wasn't sure when I would shoot, there is no leaning or cover mechanics, the laser sight is a lie, all in all I just wish there was more fluidity to the combat, especially since the stealth system consists of walking slowly.I really enjoyed the look of this game, but the combat, dialog problems and lack of skill depth make it a hard pass."
