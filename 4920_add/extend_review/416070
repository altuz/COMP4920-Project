76561198065013997,Recommended,416070,22354073,"Posted: 11 April, 2016",all,jakedradora,Mars 2030Pros:Good Strategy required with resources.Mini Game to pass the time.Must keep a constant eye on any damage the ship might sustain.Dodging incoming objects.Cons:Staring at screen for a long time waiting for something to happen.If any crew gets irradiated it is Game Over very quickly.Only one mini game that gets cancelled if an event occurs.Random crew generation. (Wish you could select your crew or have more crew members).Landing on the Moon sequence can result in Death for no reason.Now while it seems there are more cons than pros I do give this game a good chance as it is an interesting idea and if there is a bit more added to it then the game could be amazing. I know from talking to the developer that Sim mode (which is the current game) is still in progress and the Action mode is still being worked on. I'm hanging in there to see what the developer can do. Mars 2030 is defineitely something to keep an eye on

IN SPAAAAAAAAACE!EDIT: I'm adding to my review to make it slightly more helpful to people who might be interested in purchasing the game, haha.Review:The game itself certainly FEELS like an Oregon (or Organ) Trail in space. It plays out much the same way, too.You begin the game by purchasing your starting supplies and very quickly are then on the trail toward Mars!Much of the game currently consists of flying your ship, which is hurtling through space, dodging meteors and meteorites, solar flares, and other space-centric dangers (much like Oregon Trail's River scene). Every so often, you will be confronted with a situation... One of your people will have some issue or other, or some idea or other and you will be able to select what you want to do about it. The Oregon Trail theme continues. :DRecommendation:If you loved Oregon Trail (or Organ Trail), then you'll probably love this. The art style is reminiscent of older games and fits right in with the mechanics. And really, it's only $8, so if you end up not liking it, you won't be out much. Give it a go!Urist McLlurendt"
76561198027731241,Not Recommended,416070,21795277,"Posted: 12 March, 2016",all,brugnarc,"This game left me breathless... just like my crew.I will be honest on this one : i only had the courage to make one game, which was approximatively 1 hour.One hour viewing at my screen, waiting something that never came, dodging eventual meteor and boosting shield when it became low. I ended up failing at day 230 (75% of travel done !), because my crew couldn't manage to repair an oxygen leak two times, and i didn't have the option to try to repair it again.So yeah, i spend one hour looking at my beautiful vessel traveling through space with a massive oxygen leak, leaving an interesting trail behind him.About the game : there is juste nothing to do. After clicking the play button, you get an auto generated crew each with a specific job. But this has no interest : you can't do anything with them, you don't have to manage them or anything else. Sometimes they discover task to do (like, for example, repairing the f****** oxygen leak), which unlock a menu to tell them to do the task. It's one of the very few interaction you will have with them.In the next step, you must choose what you embark. Not a bad idea, but it didn't had a real impact in the only one game i played. I just took 10 of everything and didn't had any shortage.Now, you click on continue, you have a nice cutscene showing your rocket launch, and then nothing. You just observe your ship traveling, waiting for some event to occur. During my 60 minutes of gameplay, i encountered the same 6 event again and again, with most of them having no impact on the game. You can view the second video of gameplay, it is exactly what i have done for one hour.By the way, you better have viewed the ""Help"" menu before clicking the Play button, or your next step will be hammering your keyboard to find what your possibilities are. I will resume it : go up, go down, K to fire, 1/F1 to launch the minigame (??).I'm still questionning myself about the presence of the minigame. I suspect the dev had realized the game was quite boring, so he ended up adding a minigame to fill the waiting time between two events.I didn't played that minigame a lot, i was more concerned about finding a button somewhere to tell my crew to repair the oxygen leak.I'm a little sad because i can feel that many effort had been put in making this game. The graphics are not bad if you like the retro pixel style, the music/sound a little repetitive but still put you in the atmosphere.In my opinion, this game is ""just"" badly designed. It lack of good idea of gameplay."

The game switched to what I'm guessing is supposed to be a cockpit view. I then watched for 10 minutes as we slowly approached Mars. Mars then disappeared and we were just looking at stars. No available input, no indication of what was happening. Went and had dinner, came back, still looking at stars with no input available.Fun idea, horrendous implementation. A great example of the need for Steam's refund policy."
,Not Recommended,416070,30364776,Posted: 6 March,all,~Neutron~,"***WAIT***The good:Love the Green art style, the retro feel and play of the game.Sound effects and music are wonderful, what you'd expect from a retro sci-fi game.Management of ship and crew. Making decisions when to use the Shield booster and meds to heal crewmates and cool spacewalking animation.*Developer is quick to hot fix catastrophic failures.The bad:No tutorial or explanation of gameplay aspects. I.e. I’m not sure if it’s better to heal a crewmate or send him to the space gym with a withered arm. Or what do the green arrows do when your ship touches them? Still don't know what repairs require circuit boards?No choice of crewmates other than to keep going back to the start until the random generator chooses the right combination of desired crew.You need a software engineer to remove viruses, you could be halfway through or more and the ship gets a virus, your software engineer sometimes cannot fix the issue, which it almost is always catastrophic.Generally, there just isn’t enough to do to keep the interest level going. The trip takes about 70 minutes, so, if your ship does get hit by an asteroid 45 minutes into the game, you feel as though you’ve wasted your time.Wish list:I would love to see a purposeful mini game where you have to repair the ships systems (Panel replacement and removal of viruses). Perhaps a point system where you can place points into Hardware Engineer or more points into Software Engineer and so on which will affect how difficult those repair mini games would be for the player.At present, I would like to see the whole trip to be confined to 40 minutes until there is more activities to fill that time.Last word:At this stage, the game is largely repetitive and unrewarding. I have a moderate degree of hope as the developer has committed to continually updating the game, has communicated some future additions to gameplay and is open to suggestions."

This game captures a sense of reality with a mix of nostalgia for the games I loved playing as a youth. Take a space walk to fix damage to your ship or send your crew members to the media room to cheer them up. Will your ship and the choices you make for your crew endure the trip to Mars? Test your mettle while juggling the trials and tribulations of space travel. All the while defending Earth's space station from an alien invasion wave upon wave. Attention to artistry and dark color scheme gives this game an edge you rarely see in similar games, and is what really gives this game heart. Do you have what it takes to navigate to Mars?"
76561197960452157,Recommended,416070,25775071,"Posted: 29 September, 2016",all,LiveHardandProsper,"TL; DR = A great idea that, given a little more love, could turn out to be an indie classic.I really enjoy the idea of Mars 2030. I think the most apt comparison I can think of is it's a barebones Oregon Trail....IN SPACE!What I particularly value about this game is how deliberate everything is. There are few embellishments, no fluff. The mechanics gel neatly with what I've come to understand as the underlying theme and message of the game: that a realistic journey to Mars is a long-haul slog rife with equal parts tedium, uncertainty, and eventually triumph. The whole monochromatic aesthetic and MIDI soundtrack remind me of being an 8 year old playing games on floppy disk on my auntie's PC. It helps that Fallout is probably my favorite series of all time.In its current state, that's a bit of a double edged sword, however. I personally love games that do things differently. It's why I support Greenlight, Kickstarter, and crowdfunding in the first place. If gaming is to be taken seriously as an artistic medium, developers need to take risks. They need to deviate from the status quo of shooty-bang-bang FPS and iterative Sportsball games.As it stands, however, I definitely get some of the criticisms of Mars. There's a lot of dead space (PUNS!), a lot of sitting around not doing much. Again, I'm kind of a pretentious a-hole; I get the point and I really dig it. But apart from the occasional decision point about choosing equipment and what to do when Spock gets space-dysentery, the interactive/gameplay aspect isn't really there to hook the average person who wants to just sit and play. I personally just had the game running while doing some work from home or listening to podcasts.Where I can definitely see some room for improvement is adding mini-games or FTL-esque RPG/choose-your-own-adventure-like  mechanics into the mix. I think the devs can definitely add some more ""gamey"" mechanics without detracting from their intended message of a realistic Martian expedition.Ultimately, however, I think it would be an awful shame to pass this game up because of its current state. It's reasonably priced, it's experimental, and I have a feeling that the devs are in it for the long haul (their own Martian journey, if you will). I'm proud to have supported these folks and hope that they get the support to do some really cool things in the near future."

From the intro, to the graphics, and the the ever-present sense of humor, you can tell the creator put a lot of love into this game. What's more, the gameplay in Mars 2030 evolves and expands nicely. While at first you may be deciding how much wire is going to get you to mars, before long you'll be setting up your own space base and zapping alien scum to smithereens."

,Recommended,416070,32940353,Posted: 28 June,all,pinback,"An exhaustive simulation of a manned mission to Mars, meticulously detailed and pushing modern technology to its limits, this is an extremely daunting affair, with a nearly inconceivably steep learning curve, but is nonetheless vastly impressive in what it seeks out to accomplish.One would think this would be used as the primary training tool should humanity ever reach the point where we are prepared to head to the Red Planet.Astonishing.  That it can be purchased for $4.99 ($2.99 on Summer Sale) is without question the greatest deal on Steam for the forseeable future."

,Not Recommended,416070,34203124,Posted: 12 August,all,-=Jester=-,"Nice premise, just needs a bit of work to worthwhile. Random deaths or fatal accidents is one thing, but my ship crashed three times in a row on take off, that is just North Korean level incompetence. I can imagine this being a lot of fun. Add some things for the player to do, like the tasks should be more involved rather than a damn progress bar and 50/50 chance of them failing or not. Shooting asteroids is just amazingly boring, no editable controls. And the mini-games REDIFINE repetitive, inane, mind-numbing boring. With that being said, I really think this could be an awesome retro game, BTW I do love the green color, that part at least was pretty cool. Please do some work on this and upgrade. If you have plans to do this, please disregard my remarks and I eagerly await its completion...."

Groaning sounds, gagging...even snoring come closer to touching on the feelings I have playing this game.  This is a starring simulator, not a game.I was initially attracted to the art.  The usage of green seemed to evoke an artistic style.  Immidiately I gave the creator credit for his sense of Retro Techno.  Now, I realize I jumped to the wrong conclusion.  The reason it's green is because he can't code in any other palette.PROS+ Cool looking retro artCONS- Little to no instructions, figure it out as you go- Pre-release version and final version are virtually identical- Not much to do and little control over events- Minimalistic art style is initially intriguing until you realize this must have been his homework for classNo matter what the discount is, it's probably not going to lower the cost enough to make it worthwhile to own."
