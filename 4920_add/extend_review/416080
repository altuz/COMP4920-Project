,Recommended,416080,22286703,"Posted: 7 April, 2016",all,Whiteswart,"2d puzzle short-break game, where you need to help some folks lead their boats through the very troubling seas. You'll be creating small physical phenomena on the way of those boats, to save them from harm. In a Greek god way, indirectly and somehow messy, but with the good intentions at heart.With the current price and the reality of Steam ""greenlight"" Augean stables going wild with the really bad things selling great just because they have trading cards on the board... I'd say ""The Odyssey: Winds of Athena"", or whatever that game calls itself - is a decent project, which is not trying to rip you off, and providing with just enough gaming experience for the small price.That is correct, of course, only by comparisons with the weakest part of Steam, all those sleaze stuff that have any value only with cards... If we remember, that almost for the same money we can buy high-quality things like WItcher 1 (where even the optional mini-games are more inspiring than that ""Odyssey"")... That so many good games of the equal cultural value, as ""Odyssey"", are freeware from the start... Well, I can't say that I Really Recommend the game.It is working, it has quite rare, almost unique game mechanics, it is fairly provides you with the promised puzzle-like gameplay fitting to fill short pauses in your life, like awaiting in the traffic or in some queue... Yeah, that goes mostly as the thing for mobile platforms, and not full-time PC gaming experience.So I'll mark the Odyssey as 5.7/10. It is not a bad game, it is fair, costs little, has cards to align the price even more. It provides enough gameplay to fill your hands for some time... yet it is not inspiring enough to really go for it.So if you get it discounted or bundled - that's not a waste. Just don't expect much."

,Not Recommended,416080,24193215,"Posted: 8 July, 2016",all,Arabin,"The concept is brilliant, and it is a great effort at something new, but it sadly falls a little short of being fun to play.You are given the power of Athena, controlling wind and currents in the ocean, but the captions of the ship all seen to have a death wish and would rather break free of a current to run aground some rocks or a sandbar. It all feels like it could have been so much more than it is.Once you get a few levels in, and you are nudging ships through narrow spaces, triggering levers to open gates across the sea, while cyclops stand on the shore and throw boulders at your ships for fun, I had to stop playing. I wanted to be the cyclops more than have the buggy powers of a goddess.I commend the developer for a fresh idea, and I hope he makes a more polished sequel. For now, I cannot recommend this game unless you are curious about the concept, and then only when it's on sale."

Rather limited gameplay though. Most of the times it's either blind luck or good aim with frantic clicks and drags.Overall I'd say that it's not worth the pricetag though.

,Not Recommended,416080,33618400,Posted: 17 July,all,Verdantil,"Tags: Casual - Object RoutingAdditional Tags: Clicker - FastDelete Local Content & Remove from LibraryIn a nutshell: You know those snow globes you see around christmas. This game is like like, you gotta click on water in straight lines to create currents, and rotate your mouse in a little corner of the screen to create wind. All in the hope of guiding your sailboats to a designated end goal on the map. The action is very indirect and uses dubious physics to simulate both wind and water currents. The game is audiovisually underpar and seems like a very dated phone game or a flash game. I'll give it some points for originality instead of simply using angle snapping to create a casual object routing game, but the chaotic currents and your ships flailing about everywhere makes it a micromanagement nightmare, everything is so indirect, unpredictable, demands way too many clicks, and just feels tedious."

I found my hands cramping up when spinning the mouse clockwise and clicking on objects several times to prevent my ships from dieing. The game is a cakewalk in the begining but as you progress it gets really difficult to the point where you may just have to skip the level. The game can be fun but also frustrating at times due to the control scheme and difficulty. The game is something you would play to kill time. I'm not sure if theres a tablet port but if so I recommend you play it on that device.
