,Not Recommended,416110,21108441,"Posted: 10 February, 2016",all,Cyril,"The story? Nonexistent, but the game doesn't need one.The controls? Good and responsive, no issues with dropped inputs here.The graphics? Passable and never visually confusing, which is good for a precision platformer.The music? Decent, gets old once you have to listen to it so much though.But... the level design... sigh.This is just a textbook case of a game with lots of potential ruined by tedious level design. I'm gonna spoil a secret for you: Making something longer does not make it harder. It makes it more tedious. Those 6-screen, 8-screen, 10-screen levels? They could easily be several great 2-3 screen levels. Especially since this game is quite good at not repeating ideas; even the final levels are still tossing out fresh level design ideas without feeling stale.But when you have to replay the first half of a level just to even get a shot at the second half, and the first half is hard enough on its own... I get frustrated for all the wrong reasons. It's simply not fun to keep replaying the same few rooms just desperatle hoping for a chane to learn the later ones. The gauntlet levels and final boss are the main offenders here, really, they're mostly too bloody long. Gauntlet VII in particular requires you to replay through the entire level, backtrack through half of it to collect a green key, and on top of that go through the hardest room in the entire level just to get the key. Not to mention an equally hard room right below it that, thankfully, you can skip... and then you have to make it back to the end of the level after collecting the key, backtracking through the room you just went through first. And Gauntlet X... sure, it's the level that will take the longest to clear, but you wanna know why? Because  you have to clear 6 screens of gameplay to even get a shot at the later three, and I have a sneaking suspicion that there's going to be even three more beyond that door in the ceiling (even if there isn't, it's already way, way too much) [UPDATE: There wasn't, thankfully, but my point still stands.] It doesn't help that the bottom rooms are far harder than the upper rooms, and that you have to get through the already difficult top rooms just to even get a shot at the lower ones. It ain't fun, yo.Am I being fair to the game if I did genuinely enjoy it through most of the first three worlds? Ehh. Even ignoring the awful bonus level, and ignoring the last level of Warp 8 that starts out with legitimately the worst screen in platforming history, there's still too much obnoxious design in the later parts of the main game for me to recommend it. I feel like the bad significantly outweighs the good since it just completely kills any fun factor for me. But honestly if I could I still think I'd rate this a ""meh"", 'cause it's far from an awful game and a lot of the earlier level design is compact enough and interesting enough to be worth playing, especially for the low price this game is offered at."

It's totally worth the price.However, due to that lazy hitbox implementation and frustration it caused I can't give this game a positive reviev."

Unforgiving but very enjoyable at the same time, it will suck you in and you won't be prepared for it. I like tight level design, characters and controls. And Blitz Breaker somehow looks and feels like old cult classic Mighty Bomb Jack, which I can't wait to be rebooted someday properly.Oh, and I like music, too. Not every track, but most of it.I would like to see a sequel of this little gem:-)"

I personally like the idea of how the game works but sometimes the levels can be a bit long. There are a bunch of collectibles and bonus worlds, so you won't be bored quickly. Dispite the cons I still consider this as an amazing game for it's price, especially if it's on sale."
,Recommended,416110,29275983,Posted: 15 January,all,Zarcatus,An amazing platformer that catched me some minutes after I started playing. Although it has simple controls levels like Gauntlet X really aren´t as peaceful as the music. If you play this game you should definitely be patient because it can take you a long time to beat a level.All in all I had a lot of fun with this game.
,Recommended,416110,22624720,"Posted: 24 April, 2016",all,Palidian,"Tight controls and fun levels along with plenty of unlockables skins, secret bonus levels and the like make this worth the price. I was somewhat annoyed by the final level and the boss because there are no checkpoints in an extremely lengthy stage. Gauntlet IX and the final boss took me an hour of the three hours it took me to finish. I'll probably go back to unlock the warp zone bonus stages at some point. Fun and challenging."

Restarting a level, which happens constantly,puts you through a death screen and an intreo screen, a small complaint, but still bothersome. some levels, and many boss fights, require waiting. it's hard to finish a level when each attempt is punctuated by waiting for the right time, jumping, waiting again, jumping, etc., etc.overall, the game is pretty good, it needs polish, but it's fun, cheap, and good for a few minutes of playing."
,Recommended,416110,29682571,Posted: 3 February,all,Pac_Gaming,I love this game. The controls are responsive and it's just hard enough that it takes a few trie to pass some levels. The levels are fun and enjoyable and the iOS version is great as well. I wish there was a way to sync my iOS version and this though so I could play this both at home and on the go. Perfect for it you have a spare moment or two. The boss fights are enjoyable and I rather enjoy all of the levels I've played so far.

,Recommended,416110,34783820,Posted: 6 September,all,Mundungu,"This is a great original idea that's very well executed.  I originally played this in a blind race and bought the game immediately.  The advanced mechanics are introduced at a near perfect pace throughout the game to make the experience enjoyable throughout.The movement mechanics are what makes the game stand out.  You don't actually move your character, you just push a direction and your character moves all the way across the screen until hitting a wall.  This makes for unique level design with the innovative movement in the game."

,Recommended,416110,21392274,"Posted: 22 February, 2016",all,Kepsert,"This is probably the most fun game I've played over the past months.Pros:Gameplay- A fastpaced 2d platformer with a twist: you can't move! Blitz into the walls, be careful there's no spikes though! This game requires precision, fast decisions and in case of speedrunning; lots of silly tricks for optimalization! This game is original and challenging, satisfying for each level you beat!Soundtrack- The soundtrack is great. Upsweeping music that will go well with the fast gameplay. The slower water levels even have a bit more relaxed music!Bosses- The game has bosses! Extra challenges besides the regular platforming.Cons:Content- The game is pretty short as there's not a lot of content yet, however, the content that's out there is amazing and worth playing more than once! Also, more content is supposed to be on its way, or so I heard!It's not expensive and I recommend anyone who can spare some dollars to give this game a go! You'll be guaranteed to have fun!"

,Recommended,416110,20981678,"Posted: 5 February, 2016",all,Liquid Radish,"Blitz Breaker is a nice throwback to old school flash games.  I played the demo on Newgrounds and was immediately hooked.  The mechanics are fresh, the puzzles are just difficult enough to provide a challenge without making me too frusturated.  Be warned, you will find yourself saying ""Just one more level!"" about a hundred times.  I also have to warn you: the learning curve is STEEP.  I flew through 1-1 to 2-2 before anything became too challenging, but 3-2 and up are reeeally hard (not that its a bad thing).tldr: Just buy it.  Worst thing that could happen, you walk away slightly dissapointed and $3 poorer.  Buy the game instead of lunch today."

Controlling your cute little character works flawlessly and even though only 5 keys are required for movement there is a wide variety of techniques to move your character from A to B.The level of difficulty is well balanced, the game gets harder and harder once you try to master every aspect of it, beating it casually shouldn't make you rage too hard... except of course... nah, I don't want to spoiler too much :)Achievements are interesting and obtainable and NOT crap like ""Play this game X hours""Bugs... well there are none, at least none that I would know of... as soon as anything gets mentioned (bug, request) in steam discussions developers respond and in case of a bug get a patch out a few days later. (A big ""Thank you"" from my side here)The soundtrack is really refreshing and fits the gameplayThe price...I bought the game&soundtrack-bundle and knowing what gameplay this game offers I would have probably paid twice as much.ConsSound and music can either be turned on or off, the volume can't be adjusted. If there actually is a way to lower the volume and I was only too blind to see it I am sorry, but then this definitely is a user interface issue ^^Next to achievements there are currently no Steam features available for this game, but from what I've read in the discussions this is something that DEVs are currently working on (Trading Cards)All in all this game is totally worth the money and I would be the first one buying a DLC if one get's added to the game... I wouldn't complain if additional content was added as a free feature update of course :D"

As such, you can find my reviewing ethos and scoring systems on the Pastebin review.Gameplay: Controls are very slick and fluid, game is a lot of fun to play very fast, some stages don't allow for fast gameplay but many others are geared for speed, bosses are pretty alright, difficulty curve shoots up quite heavily in the last area but it's not too harsh, stages are very fair and well designed. 8/10.Story: No real story to speak ofGraphics: Art style is very clean and bright, game doesn't have much in the way of graphics options but it doesn't need to, fullscreens to your native resolution and windowed can be resized to any resolution, uncapped 60FPS throughout for me. 4/5.Sound: Soundtrack was good for what it was, but not something I'd listen to outside of the game. 3/5.8/0/4/3; 7.5/10. Definitely worth a look, and is much better than a lot of the $3 shovelware drek that gets on Steam nowadays (note: this game is most definitely not mobile shovelware, it was released on PC first).Edit 1 (2/12/2016): One minor addendum is that they patched out the not so well thought out timed gate that can prevent you from getting a character in the final boss level. This doesn't affect score, but something that should be noted."
