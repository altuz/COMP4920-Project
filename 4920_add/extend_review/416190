76561198022043667,Recommended,416190,19810721,"Posted: 20 December, 2015",all,Jawsman01,"I LOVE this Sim!This sim delivers just what it claims to, and so much more. Which is a great deal more than I can say for ANY other simulator currently out or released in the last decade. Experienced Flight Simmers know what I mean here.This is the most fun with a Flight Sim I've enjoyed since BEFORE microsoft ruined the flight sim genre by dumping barely functional FS titles on the market. Look no further than microsoft's bottomless pit of greed forcing Combat Flight Simulator 3 and FSX onto the world knowing that barely anything less than a Cray supercomputer could run them above 16 fps when they were new and semi-new!I and hundreds of  thousands of other PC pilots wish that we had the months of our lives handed back to us that we ALL wasted in vain attempts surfing the web to discover some fix to tweak better framerates out of those rehash-cashgrabs.Can I get a witness?!Well not this Sim brother, this one looks good and runs  S M O O T H !This Sim does what it says AND MORE AAaaaannnd it's really FUN!Is it a fully dedicated  100% flight sim that is better than anything else ever created? No.Is it pretty close to that even though it doesn't brag that it is? YES!Is it better at flight simming than FS2004, FSX and Xplane?I honestly think so now and will answer that more confidently after the coming updates.> Vehicle Simulator is currently a better Flight Sim than 9 out of 10 titles in my opinion, and I played them all since the days of the Amiga 4K.Could it be better? Yes, and it is improving all the time now.It may not have the entire globe like FSX but what it does have looks and runs wonderfully.Pro's>Better at simulation than most other sims.>Small download, massive number of free DLC addons of very high quality.>Powerful physics that can be felt + High framerates maxed all settings with 50-75fps on midrange PC> Best described as crossing a physics based Flight & Sail Simulator with Gary's Mod <>Although a few crashes here and there due to my extreme and far fetched ideas in the sim I will call this a VERY stable simulator.> Love the music choices in game, especially sailingNotable features:Lots of options. If you can fly, drive or sail it then it can be done in here, and done well.* The community can make and import even more content  > EASILY <* What a treat to have some little known music {french and Mexican] playing in the background as you watch the sun set and stars pop out while sailing, yachting or in your one man sub! = Mucho relaxing...>>>> DROP DEAD GORGEOUS WAVES AND OCEAN [viewed from below or above] BETTER THAN ANY OTHER SIM <<<<* The air combat is on par with titles I spent far more for, and those titles never delivered.* Impressive and fun cockpit POV, although hoping for more polished graphics and sound variety soon.* The creator is excited and active to pick up were he left off pre-Steam, so lots of upgrades and content coming.One Example that impresses me:The in-game stock F86 jet looks like it is made from highly polished metal, almost chrome. Strikingly beutiful to look at. By contrast this is how DCS World advertises their $Extra$ charge F86 but theirs looks only grey in reality because their DCS engine is 20+ years old and cannot render shiny bare metals!* So this Vehicle Simulator DOES IT BETTER THAN DCS currently does! * [Yes I own all DCS]Sure the DCS cockpits are superior in graphical quality and function, but I see the Dev seriously upgrading cockpit detail, functionality and quality soon. Where DCS is maxed out being CPU greedy it looks to me that Vehicle Simulator is just getting started with lots of room to upgrade.☺ You cannot claim that from DCS or microsoft whose re-re-re-overhauled game engines stopped bearing fruit over a decade ago.Cons:>Wished I would have discovered this sooner.>Powerful simulator but I need tutorials to help me wring the most out of things. I am still confused on many aspects and stumbling around trying to figure things out.** Interface is VERY user friendly however.>The graphics are very beautiful at times, but dated at others. I look forward to smoother hard-dark shadows in the cockpits, sharper reflections, and other more modern graphical eye-candy that has spoiled us in other titles.>Sounds are limited with one plane or car sounding like the next.> Unknown at this time how to set up dogfights, create new vehicles, change textures due to lack of hand holding tutorials>Have to start Steam to play. Like most I want to be able to play offline since we live in such a bandwidth depleted areaMy hopes for the future are:* Be able to fly, sail or sub anywhere in the world* Updated and more modern graphics, textures, more realism rendering light and shadows and better explosions* Ability to set up player vs Ai opponents easier* More vehicles flooding the workshop <hint-hint>* More ocean life to sub around and sail by* More stock adventures, although there are more than most sims offer already* The ability to be an animal or fish or bird like in Gary's mod. [ this opens up the wonderful can of worms allowing the player to control [[create]] player animals like we create animatronic sharks for movies. ] Imagine getting to be a dinosaur, shark or whatever in this Sim, it'd be AWESOME!My respect and honest thanks to the developer and his family. So glad you came to Steam so I could find you!"

People buy it because of the huge array of downloadable content that websites offer for it. Quality Simulations website and forum are where you get the ships and planes for free from memebers of the community. You can not judge this game until you have used them as you are not getting the full experience. It is worth it all the way.

Crashes come on swift wings with this game, so save often, and don't do anymore to ""rock the boat"" than you need to. (spawning ships, changing times, etc.)There isn't a better ship game out there though, so grudgingly have to recommend."

76561197972244201,Recommended,416190,25162183,"Posted: 26 August, 2016",all,pebblegarden,"I've owned Vehicle Simulator for a few years, and over that time I've grown very fond of it. Lately I've been starting to use it as a way to teach my friends how to fly simulators, and so far it's working well in that capacity.Since most of those friends don't have joysticks or controllers, I've been learning to fly it with keyboard + mouse only in order to help them. The keyboard + mouse control in VS is surprisingly good, though helicopters are almost impossible to fly without a joystick.The game supports TrackIR and various peripherals.If you want a simulator that scratches many of the same itches as Microsoft Flight Sim or X-Plane without overwhelming complexity, Vehicle Simulator is worth a try."
,Recommended,416190,34762053,Posted: 5 September,all,martiniman_ala_cheese,"Vehicle Simulator is a great game that allows you to fly and drive a wide range of vehicles, including submarines, sailboats, aircraft, helicopters, cars, and RC quadcopters. The amount of DLC available for free on the internet for this game is vast, allowing for a wide range of scenarios on land, sea, or air.What I like:-Realistic sailboat controls, which I haven't seen in any other game.-Highly unique vehicles available like flying boats and spacecraft all in a single game.-Everything is customizable, and you can even design your own vehicles if you have the skill.What I don't like:-Although very difficult to get started with flying, once you get the hang of it, it's very fun.-The graphics leave much to be desired.-Many add-ons are from 3rd party sites, making me think twice about downloading a vehicle (although I haven't seen any malware yet.)This game is for vehicle enthusiasts who enjoy taking leisurely adventures, or designers who want to drive their creations with total control of the stats. I was tired of seeing high priced simulators with expensive DLC, so having a game with unlimited options and a one-time price was very appealing."

Do not expect to have ALL the real equipment with the fidelity as in a proper simulator such as the FSX or XP10. However, the design feature is very good, despite it's complexity and non-intuitive procedures.The game is very smooth, howeve, it has plenty of freezes and crashes also.I'm giving it a positive review because it is in a good state already, despite the needs of bugs fixing."
,Not Recommended,416190,31470160,Posted: 30 April,all,Mr Ruski,Not a bad game but it's a bit odd. I wouldn't recommend it though due to its price. It's not worth £18.99 any day if you got it cheap in a sale then fair enough.
,Recommended,416190,29615703,Posted: 31 January,all,JustAPotato,"This game is amazing. I have played virtual sailor 7 which is an older game made in 1999 and it is similar to this accept it was just for shi[s. The controls in this are perfect and feel like VS7. Most of VS7's ships are also compatiable which is even better. For an indie 2009 game, This is fantastic. This is better then Ship Simulator Extremes and 2008 and 2006 and has free ships and free scenery. You can even model your own ships. People have made ocean liners and ships like Titanic and Olympic and even old cars and airplanes. You can recreate plane landings and ship sailings.This is also great for machinimas as you can create youtube videos like some of mine on my profile. You can use weapons, set the time in game; Create huge waves and storms; Sink and tilt ships and do more things than any simulator. This game is up there with OMSI/OMSI 2 and VS7 and many other simulators. It feels like a true game and this is Ilans first steam game and is one of the best games on steam. It does have issues like sharp edges and  weired textures but simple mesh and nVidia inspector.If i could give this game an honest score, I would give it a 9/10. The reason for 9 and not 10 is tge graphical issues. Other then that, this game is perfect. I do hope Ilan releases VS7 for steam."

It would be nice if the game supported mouse control more but based on the quality of this game I can't really complain.  The best thing to put in the steam version would be flying boats and large passenger planes besides the two Airbuses avaliable from the DLC pack. All in all a very good game and it was worth every penny.
76561198259691432,Recommended,416190,30348406,Posted: 5 March,all,riddlemethis1021,"Yup. I like it. It has no campaign, though it does have a couple missions you can complete. Now, It's only fun if you know all of the controls. And they are quite complicated. So you will have to take a while to learn everything to press for this and that, and the help buton in the main menu will help. But other than that, it's great."
