,Recommended,416240,21571634,"Posted: 1 March, 2016",all,Mia,"2D Space Minecraft. Seriously. You start out with a simple trusty mining laser and a newbie station, build further crafting systems, build ships, build more SPACE STATIONS, and so on.I've always had trouble telling from the trailers of these sorts of games whether they emphasize the arcade/shooting parts, or maybe they're FTL clones, or just really boring and cheaply made. But this is the real deal so far, for me.Graphics that don't look like some poorly put-together Unity thing. Instead you have pretty block-graphics, lighting effects, and a very snappy responsive interface.Also there are actual PHASER ARCS like star trek that you have to aim, which should give an idea of the kind of game you're getting into.Wish there were quests and other star systems to visit, but comparable things are already in the feature list and will be coming soon enough if the devs are to be trusted. Based on what I've seen, I believe in them.P.S. A server browser would be really nice and would encourage early adopters to get together easier, I think."

I also love FTL and other space related games so I might be a tad biased. This game is different than those but somehow retains a similar addiction~  I also like pixel art, customization, and exploration. I just feel like this game has a really great feel.I did not expect there to be much to do in it's early access state. But seeing where the Dev's are in the development process and seeing how much crafting and customizing there is/will be has got me excited to say the least!You start in a little tiny pixelated spacecraft in a star system next to a space station. You can zoom in and out and open up a menu for your ship and stations. You mine asteroids and pick up ore's and craft new items/kit's ect. Your ship can take damage and be repaired. You can warp to other star systems and mine more exotic planets and asteroids as well as explore other wrecked ships and destroyed space stations to collect their goodies!There is already tons of crafting objects in the menu but no fear you can check a box to show only the itmes you are able to craft. You can add remove/upgrade parts from your ships and stations. Your starting ship called the ""Venture"" does not have much cargo space, so you may find yourself storing things on your home station which you can frequent anytime to drop off or pick up items. Once you have collected/explored enough content you will start to upgrade lasers to mine faster or possibly purchase/build a new and better ship.It is possible to generate systems for new games using seeds similar to the way it worked in minecraft. Some have called this terraria in space and I can see the relation but this game feels very unique in it's own right.The game is composed of tiles so customization and modding should be avaiable and simple for most everyone making future options and new content limitless~Core mechanics seem solid and as I am writing this I am looking forward to diving back in.The game is simply charming!I wish this game was getting more attention than it is which is funny because I read where the developers were surprised that it was getting so much attention. I will probably buy another copy or two and gift a few friends I know would enjoy it.The (I believe) 2 dev's seem to be very proactive and motivated, engaging their community and soaking up feedback. I will be playing the game more and more as time goes on but felt it necessary to come post comments and thumb it up to help thrust the game forward.I will be back to update my post as I consume more content and as the game progresses.Thank You Dev's~ Keep up the great work!"

Mining, crafting, upgrading and etc all in a space setting. Ships, stations, asteroids, AI and etc. Multiplayer! This game has all the beginnings of something deep and awesome. It really does. Performance is great, good options in the menus as well. I would say its well worth my $8 as is. Now add the potential for some more development and its an easy purchase."

76561198023436355,Recommended,416240,31165964,Posted: 15 April,all,Hard Bastard,"A very promising game, even in the early alpha. You can desing your own ship, make it any shape and size you want, and outfit it with whatever components you want. You could even make a full sized, fully functional Death Star. Really. There are also enemy factions and ships to fight, which is the only way to get higher leveled components at the moment. The universe size is massive. You could fly for hours, at light speed, and still not see everything. Theres lots to explore and discover. As the game develops, I'm sure we'll see many improvements and features added in. Keep an eye on this one, Its going to be big.To the developer: There are some things I would like to see implemented (you are probably already working on some of  them)- Working, joinable factions. Because it kind of sucks that everyone is hostile toward me no matter where I go.- A more in depth ship building interface, including engery output and consumption.- Singularities, cosmic storms, comets, and other hazards and ""weather""- The ability to craft stronger components beyond the 2nd tier.- A trading and currency system- A job or contract system, allowing you to take jobs from ships and stations, such as ""go deliver this"" or ""hunt down this ship"" or ""Im stranded and need repairs"" or even ""mine asteroids""- A shield system. Something like, a shield would cover a certain area aound it, and higher tier shields would cover a larger area. The shield would consume energy and when depleted would need time to recharge."

76561198151129091,Recommended,416240,31761891,Posted: 14 May,all,Bike Man,"http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=901238177So I've got over 200 hours on Space Impossible and been playing it pretty much exclusively since the pre Alpha 5 versions were out. I've been playing it since the first Alpha, so I've gotten to enjoy seeing the progress that has happened with it and gotten to know a bit about what the developers have in mind for the full game. It's about time I wrote a review because I really like this game and I have been sharing a lot of content of it lately. I even started a YouTube channel.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZmkcMNcJ3Y&t=37shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrukZw2voSQ&t=2shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRvTUlX1VPMJust as a disclaimer, my videos there are not of standard gameplay but of artificially-induced difficulty using cheats to spawn lots of enemies.I want to say that a lot of the reasons I decided to buy this game had to do with the nostalgic itch factor. The vintage space sims that I was reckoning include (this might be giving away my age here) Mine Storm (1982), Escape Velocity (1996), Armada (1999), and EV Nova (2002). Space Impossible shares enough of the same qualities with these games that my itch was not left unscratched, and since it is a new game with its own style and depth it offers even more than that! For the first time I can actually build the spaceship however I want it and fly around the universe taking on whatever is out there in retro pixel fashion. We didn't have crafting in those games either, but it is quite popular in modern games and it plays into this game's structure very well. The aspect that drove a lot of earlier games in this genre was difficulty, and with a game called Space Impossible, you would expect there to be some sort of difficulty progression that was especially challenging. The truth is, that's not really the case with this current version, which is why I took to adding lots of extra bad guys for video capture. But that's just this version, which is scaled back considerably from earlier Alphas that included level progression, among other things that are missing for the time being. The reason for that was because the developers got a lot of encouragement early on (myself included) to allow player-built creations with an in-game editor. Naturally a lot of things had to be re-written, so we're left with a pared-down version that was created to meet that demand, with plans to bring back previous functionalities like trading and torpedoes, as well as adding more future yet-to-be-determined content. This sums up why I think you should buy the game now if you think you might like it: our developers here, rexspaceman and Stuffie, have been really eager to please their gamerbase so far, and have every indication of following through on that all the way to the game's release. They are ready to take input and plan out the rest of the development based on whatever suggestions you might have. If you like Early Access games for the fun of seeing a good game evolve into a great one, don't miss this game."

,Not Recommended,416240,28983840,Posted: 3 January,all,Lowen,"I should say I bought this because I really like the pixel artstyle and the trailer makes it look really fun and exciting. Maybe if I got to the part with combat it would be, but the game starts you with a ship that just has a mining laser and nothing else in an area with no enemies.I can't recommend this right now simply because the early game is just so dull. Shoot some space rocks and run over the ore it drops a bunch of times so that you can save up enough space rocks in order to buy the very first mining laser upgrade, so that you can mine faster and maybe get to the fun part of the game.Well, a game with that discription could be fun and not boring, if the process of shooting space rocks and collecting ore was actually fun, and the time to get enough for upgrades was short. Sadly that is not the case here. After playing this dull tedium for 40 minutes, I'm calling it quits.There's no in game tutorial and the crafting interface is horrible, not to mention the mining laser upgrade will cost you a lot of ore - why? Will making the very first mining laser upgrade cheaper unbalance the game? No.Is it a challenge to mine the asteroids? No, there aren't any enemies or other survival concerns in the first area.Is the early game mining just fun on its own? No, the ore just sits there are doesn't react to your ship or its enviroment in any way except to magically disappear when you run over it.Speaking of the crafting interface... why do I have to drag stuff over into the crafting area in order to craft with it? What is the point of that? It's not like Minecraft where different shapes on a crafting grid make different things, it's just a line and the order doesn't matter. You can't even store things in the crafting area. So why does it exist? Just use the inventory.Simply put the early game needs work making it actually fun and not some chore you have to do before you get to the possibly fun parts of the game.Also note ship design is not in the game yet, except as an experimental update that also disables SAVING THE GAME and AI."
