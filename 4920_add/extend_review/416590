76561198203043133,Recommended,416590,19659001,"Posted: 12 December, 2015",all,Qik,"Cute game about a girl ordering a pizza which in actuality is her way of bringing a playmate home for a foursome with her friends all night long.  Once you figure out the ""games"" she and her friends want to play and follow their ""rules"" you can make it through the night with relative ease along with a big tip and a happy ending.  Here are some hints I will give to help those having trouble getting paid for the pizza delivery and satisfying Emily and her friends.Spoilers/Walkthrough Below:1. Paper Notes can be picked up and read both on their front and back so turn them over for hints and story lore.  A flashlight can be found in one of the rooms and is needed to finish the game. You keep it even if continuing after death.Audio recorders can also be listened to and will provide backstory to the game.2. The game is broken into 7 parts/hours. After a certain amount of ingame/real time passes the clock will chime and move into the next phase of the game. When you continue, the game will resume at the previous hour you reached.11PM-12AM is the intro to the game where you get to meet the dolls and explore the house.12AM-1AM is playing a game with Kiki (the female doll in a black dress)1AM-2AM is playing two games with Kiki and Mr. Tatters (clown)2AM-3AM is playing two games with Mr. Tatters and Chester (male doll in suit)3AM-4AM is playing three games with all three dolls4AM-5AM is playing with Emily alone5AM-6AM is playing with Emily and all three dolls3. During the first hour of the game, the game itself is leading you to a ""secret"" by opening doors towards the parent's bedroom closet. In the bedroom itself is a note that will explain how to exploit the ""secret"" that will lead to the basement. Without opening the secret passage, it is nearly impossible to beat the game. Find the correct wall lamp in the room to touch.4. The white board in the kitchen gives hints on how to play with each dolls, the first three hours are a lie (due to winking face) so you want to do the opposite of what it says. When you hear a particular sound cue in a room, the game is telling you that one of the dolls has entered and you must deal with him/her.  Kiki has a childish chuckle, Mr. Taters has a low sounding chuckle, and Chester has a higher pitch laugh.5. These are the games each dolls/Emily wants to play and how to deal with them.  Kiki wants to play red light/green light with you being the light post so once you hear her chuckle look for her immediately and stare at her until she vanishes. If she is not in your field of vision she will make it to the light post (you) eventually. You can also run from her into nearby rooms which she may or may not follow.  Mr. Tatters is playing the same game but in reverse roles. Once you hear his sound cue, stop all movement immediately and wait until he goes through another two sound cues with the second sounding like a sigh. Once he leaves the room you may begin moving again. Chester is playing tag and he is ""it"".  Once you hear his sound cue, run away into another room as fast as you can or he will tag you.  Emily wants to play hide and seek in the dark so once she shows up at 4AM, you are given a timer to find her in the house but luckily it's just the two of you. If you turn on a lightswitch, she will come after you for not playing her game correctly, so the flashlight is needed to proceed. If the timer drops to zero you lose and she will find you instead. Once you do find her and tag (touch) her, she will hide again in the house and the timer will reset. Each room has one possible  hiding spot so continue playing with her until the next hour comes and memorize the locations to save time seaching each room. If you don't find the entrance to the basement you may never get past this part since she sometimes hides down there. Also sometimes she is tricky but hiding in the same spot twice with each timer reset so check it again if you can't find her. Lastly, for the final hour Emily wants everyone to play so now you must continue to look for Emily through the house while dealing with the three dolls.  Run from Kiki (stare her down if you have the time though) and Chester but stop for Mr. Tatters.Make it through this and you finish the game. Good luck!"

Items which explain what happened are few and far between. Since the back story is communicated in those same items you examine around the house, you will quickly find everything, and will be left with just evading the monsters for the rest of the game.Very limited settings: Widescreen only options, and no ability to invert mouse vertically.Later sections will throw you completely at the mercy of the randomly generated monster placements.

,Recommended,416590,20442681,"Posted: 10 January, 2016",all,Havri Horse,"Emily wants to play is a fairly new horror game that has seen some attention by the lets player community, so heres another random persons thoughts on the game+ The games core monsters all look very clean. I always thought that for a game made by 1 guy, the models actually look pretty nice.+ Due to the random nature of the game, this game has some replayability, especially doing 5 am over and over again.+ The game is fairly simple to grasp. It didn't take long for me to find out what each monster does and how to get rid of them+ As far as the jumpscares, They are all unique and did get me quite a few times. They even use different sounds!+ The game is actually difficult (especially in the later levels) Which is good because if it was easy, I bet it would of gotten boring fast.+ The flashlight in this game isn't a complete joke.- As far as the scare factor goes, I personally didn't find this game that scary. The only thing that really scares me is chester. I personally dont mind because the gameplay is good- The story is kinda lackluster. I didn't really find myself getting engaged with it like FNaF for example.- Whenever you die, you have to restart back at the main menu instead of there being a retry button. Kind of a nitpick, but it kind of ruins the flow of the gameplay when I want to skip the main menu/clock animation.- I kind of wish there was more. But I guess that is a good complaint to have.OVERALL: Emily wants to play is a fantastic game for horror and non horror fans alike. I feel like its creepy enough to get into, but fun enough to want you to keep playing. I just hope there is a sequal at some point, and thanks to Shawn Hitchcock for making such a fantastic game. Even if there isn't a sequal, I hope whatever you work on in the future is just as good."

76561198054530417,Recommended,416590,19797532,"Posted: 19 December, 2015",all,TheBoot >:o,"Well, what can I say about this game?  As you can see, I haven't played it very much, because it scared the poo out of me!Most of the derogatory comments I see are 'it's Pewdie-bait' or 'just cheap jump scares' or 'graphics suck'.  And I can give you that last one, the graphics are not cutting edge, it's very much an indie-style game and it shows, lacking a lot of the polish a AAA title would have.Probably why it's only $5 and not $60.Yes, it has jump scares, but I find them to be very well done.  The first time I crept through the house and saw dummies moving when I looked away, or lights turn out as soon as I left a room, or some little girl-beast crawling behind some furniture causing me to immediately turn around and leave the room and close the door, it scared the crap out of me.  And those aren't 'jump scares'.  That is building atmosphere.  I felt tense, on edge, creepy... and I hadn't even reached the part of the game where the things attack me, yet.  Might be because I play in the dark with my back to an empty room like a pro.I got so scared I exited the game before anything actually happened to me, and I'm terrified to try again.  This is EXACTLY what a horror game is supposed to do: scare your pants off.  It's not 'just jump scares'.  If you're an Internet Tough Guy or just hard to scare, if things like The Grudge and The Ring don't freak you out, you probably won't be scared by this game.Gameplay is pretty simple, you can look around, move, and right-click to activate stuff.  As the night wears on, different 'levels' of murder-dolls come at you, and each is defeated by differing methods you're left to discover these on your own.  There's a few hints lying around the game world, but mostly you're left to try it yourself.  It's not a long game, it's probably not even that difficult, but for only five bucks?  It definitely delivers on the creepy for that.If you're expecting a polished, exquisite product with great graphics and 10+ hours of gameplay and lots of replayability for five dollars, well... you're kind of silly.  Or spoiled.For the price, this game gives you exactly what it promises.  So it gets my first ever thumbs up review."
76561198048974498,Recommended,416590,19655197,"Posted: 12 December, 2015",all,rjmacready,"Before I played this game, I already had a mild phobia of creepy dolls.  Lord knows I've played enough horror games to have already learned how treacherous THEY can be.  But thanks to Emily Wants to Play, I can safely add PIZZA DELIVERY GUYS to my list of creepy, untrustworthy phenomena.  Because apparently it's normal practice for them to go up to the door of a house they're delivering food to, invite themselves THROUGH said door if no one answers, then proceed to walk through every room in the house ostensibly ""looking"" for someone, even though their attempts to call out for another human being have thus far met with no reply whatsoever.Whoops...did I say EVERY ROOM?  I meant as many rooms as they're able to traverse before suddenly, inexplicably, and completely without warning getting a jump scare and a return to the Menu screen.I do appreciate that two of the most influential horror games of recent years have been Amnesia: The Dark Descent and Five Nights at Freddy's.  Emily Wants to Play clearly takes influence from both of these, and places events in a suburban house setting which, as best as I can tell, only has about ten rooms and a corridor or two in it.  I'm especially seeing a lot of comparisons to FNAF in other reviews - big surprise there, given all the fourteen year-olds who think that it's the first horror game ever made - but there's two things which FNAF can boast about having which this game most definitely CAN NOT:  A story, and clear instructions.  Simply put, you're a better mother-♥♥♥♥er than me if you can actually work out what the game wants you to do, and what you have to do in order to survive more than one or two minutes past midnight.Now, I'm quite, quite sure that we can all rely on the indiscriminating fanboys and fangirls to build upon the ""mythology"" which is, at best, in its barest of bones in the actual GAME, and I look forward to all the comments below telling me how stupid I am, 'cause ""Dont u know that when such-and-such a doll is active u have to do this, this & this in order to stay alive, are you stoopid or sumthin cos its on all the forums and us good playerz know how to do it and I can speedrun the whole game in twelve minitz and ur a dumbass kunt and why dont u lern to READ u stupid kunt...""Hey, you know why I don't read forums to work out how to play games?  'Cause I expect the games themselves to give me SOME VAGUE HINTS as to what I'm supposed to be doing, like, WITHIN THE GAME SOMEWHERE.  Preferably somewhere near the beginning, and with a bit of a learning curve (not just cheap, instant death in the first ten minutes).  Emily may well want to play, but she'll have to tell me WHICH GAME she wants to play first!  Am I playing hide-and-go-seek, where I'm supposed to be LOOKING for someone or something?  Or am I the one who should be hiding, in which case, WHY CAN'T I?  I understand that Outlast wanted me to hide in lockers and under beds...'CAUSE IT TOLD ME SO.Listen up, all you new, rebellious, ""cutting-edge"" horror devs...something isn't clever and enigmatic just because it's incomprehensible.  That's the ""look everyone, I♥♥♥♥♥♥in a jar and now it's on display at the Louvre"" approach to modern ""art"", in other words.  It's the same as the lyricist who writes a whole truckload of wank and says stuff like, ""Well, I don't know what I meant when I wrote it, it's up to the LISTENER to decide for themselves.""  Well, you know what?  I'm a little tired, as a gamer, of having to try and work out what games want me to do.  I'm not saying I need my hand held - I'm perfectly happy with games which tell you the bare minimum, and force you to LOGICALLY work things out from there - but THERE'S NOTHING LOGICAL GOING ON HERE!  Why doesn't my pizza guy just leave via the front door?  Or try and jump out a window, failing that?  Or failing even THAT, how about screaming out for help from the neighbours or just shutting himself in a cupboard and crying himself to sleep?  Why does he explore the house FOR NO APPARENT REASON?!  Are all pizza guys really that brave and/or stupid?!?  Aaaaaaarrrrrgggghhhhhh!!!Now for the part where I justify giving this a thumbs-up, when I'm essentially arguing that this game is nigh-on unplayable to all bar the faithful with far too much time on their hands (or only two games in their library, 'cause their Mums don't give them that much pocket money to throw around).  Firstly, this game IS scary.  Shawn Hitchcock, despite having learned absolutely nothing from his late, great-great uncle about how to create suspense through STORY, does have some mastery of how to create an atmosphere.  Which is always impressive, I believe, when said atmosphere is completely devoid of any CONTEXT.  But the visuals and sound ARE, for the most part, pretty effective, I'll certainly cop to that.Secondly, as many a reviewer (including myself) has whinged about in the past, there's no ""neutral"" button in Steam reviews.  It's a thumb-up or a thumb-down, and not only is this game not anything even approximating TECHNICALLY incompetent, but there is apparently - glancing at the forums - a whole cavalcade of people who've managed to get much, much further into the game than I have, so clearly it can be done.  My problem is that I HONESTLY COULD NOT BE ♥♥♥♥ED, when the dev could similarly not be ♥♥♥♥ed trying to give ANY motivation, whatsoever, for my character to do, well, basically ANYTHING.I mean, it's ""not rocket science"", let's face it.  Outlast..♥♥♥♥♥♥ some big crazy ♥♥♥♥er threw me down to a lower floor in this whacked-out asylum (which I entered because I'm a journalist looking for a juicy story), and now I can't leave the way I came in.  BUT I AM TRYING TO FIND ANOTHER WAY OUT.   That's the first thing they'll tell you in Drama school...your character needs an OBJECTIVE.  Alien: Isolation..♥♥♥♥♥♥ I've crash-landed on this space station where an alien organism is killing everyone, I NEED TO GET OFF THIS SPACE STATION.  ASAP.  Emily Wants to Play...hey, I'm just here to deliver pizza, no one answered the door, may as well have a wander around.  Hey, creepy dolls and laughter and♥♥♥♥♥♥ I think I'll stay and explore some more.  Hey, that's really interesting, some strange spooky girl is spider-crawling her way quickly across the floor, I think I might go and say hello...OH ♥♥♥♥, WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?!  DEAD.So who's the thumb-up for?  Ninety-five per cent of people who play horror games, apparently...you know, people who write reviews much shorter than this tiresomely long one and just say something about how it was ""really spoopy, 11/10, would poop pants again"".  In all honesty, it IS a great game, if you just wanna make a fifteen minute Youtube video to show off your best PewDiePie impersonation.  For the 5% of us horror gamers who actually require a bit of story and/or context, it's worth a buck or two at best, on sale, and even then just out of passing curiosity.Emily Wants to Play is a long, long, LONG way from the worst horror game on Steam, but it's also quite some way off being the best.  The dev might even be one worth keeping an eye out for, should he ever decide to take a proper lesson from the FNAF games and actually EXPLAIN to the player what they're supposed to be doing, and more importantly, WHY.  We horror fans really, REALLY don't expect a whole lot of story and/or logic from our horror games, but the vaguest semblance of either never goes astray.Verdict: 6/10."

The house is nice to look at and walk around in. Controls are responsive and turning light switches on/off and opening/closing doors is not a hassle. There are light story elements narrated through the cassette tapes found in different parts of the house.The rules are easy to follow once you learn them and the game becomes easier once you get the hang of it and know what you're supposed to be doing. It's hilarious watching other people play who don't know the rules. The jump scares are creepy and I love that there can be more than one in a row depending on how you accidentally time them.The game has a survive the night element, red light-green light and hide and seek mixed into it."

Vacated bowels.In hindsight a game that takes 10 minutes to ""win?"" might not be worth $5. Get this game on sale for $1. I think there's about 10 rooms, 3 radios, 2 recordings, 2 creepy dolls, one clown, and 1 Emily. Thats about all the content of this game. Don't get me wrong, what this game does, it does VERY WELL... Standing at the front door and not moving WILL NOT SAVE YOU... Just wait until the clock strikes 12... They are ALL out to get you.EDIT: The clown is cheap imo. The girl/guy manniquin dolls stop when you look at them. Then you turn away, they get closer, look at them again they stop. This works. This is a good gameplay mechanic. The clown ""gets"" you whether you look at him, runaway, or anything. This is cheap imo. If you fix the clown to the rules of the other entities, this would be a great game.EDIT #2: This game is scary as f... Until the 1 hour mark. You die so often, it goes from terror to annoyance. You're not given time to amply explore without dying. Now this might be on purpose since the game is small, but it's still a negative.DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME if:1. You are scared of the dark...

You're claustrophobic or cleithrophobic or have anxiety.DO Play this game if you like your heart to stop.10/10 creepiness/scariness, 5/10 gameplay/value.So apparently the clown is supposed to not get you if you stand still.

Without giving away any spoilers to this game it just seems a tad bland... i mean when your emmersed it does make you jump but the size of the playable area is `REALLY small and with very few interactive elements to the scenary it gets repetetive really quick. Also untill you work out the method you will die ALOT and it respawns you to the latest hour on the clock with annoying view of the clock and the noise of the bells. The atmosphere is okay but can feel pretty empty although there is a few mementos 'sound recordings' etc alot more creepy notes and environmental changes would have gone a long way to aid the atmosphere of the game. There is literally no musical/cinematic audio and sound effects are litterally doors opening and scutterling. Maybe im being a bit harsh as this game does look quite pretty and has playanle value but ultimatley it feels like that one annoying mission on a really game that actually makes you not bother finishing the game.

Five Nights at Freddy's introduced this loathsome new trend in the horror genre, which is games centered 100% around jumpscares, and Emily Wants to Play followed suit. If you're into that sorta thing, then perhaps you should consult another review to see if this is any good, because I prefer the old school, slowly building dread kind of horror championed by the likes of, for instance, Silent Hill.This sort of experience is - for me - extremely stressful to play (not in a good way), and I wouldn't be surprised if long term exposure shortened one's lifespan."

I like horror movies and this was the first horror game that I have tried on the vive.Well, I can't really reccomen it as I only got 10 minutes into the game, but I will say that it is indeed scary. I was too scared to explore. I went into a couple rooms and I kept running back into the living room under the light. I have never been so creeped out. THen, since I assume I failed to do anything but hide in a corner of a well lit room the game decided  enough your dead.I got a jump scare/death that made me scream so loudly, a true bellow, at the top of my lungs that I stopped playing, so that the neighbors wouldn't hear me screaming and call the cops. I'm going to try this again sometime soon, but not tonight. I honestly think this could give one nightmares played at night on the Vive."

I jumped and cursed out loud several times, and never got past roughly 5 minutes of play before being destroyed by the doll in black. From the looks of the shots above, there's a clown and another doll you come into contact with, but I was never able to make it to them. I saw the clown sitting down, and he vanished, but the doll in black is the one who got me every time. I'm not sure what to do to advance further, but I'll keep trying, and researching, to find out. One thing that I did notice was some graphical and placement issues. I couldn't resize inside the Vive with the C button, or right controller pads/triggers, and found myself floating above the floor in a few areas. There were pages I couldn't get to, because the game graphics kept turning over on themselves, and when the clock struck 12, it always ported me back to the living room before flipping me back to where I was before it struck. I'm not sure if that's intended or not, but it was disorienting.

It lasts only minutes but the reactions it can get when watching friends or famliy play it is fantastic. I had to adjust supersampling settings below 1 to get it to run smoothly on my mid spec VR ready PC. I would suggest to shut your eyes when the game first loads up as it moves you automatically and spins you round really quickly and made me feel instantly sick. I would love for that bit to be removed and sure others have felt the same. A flash light and a slower build up would really add to this experience. Exploring the area more before any scary interactions would make this 10/10. I felt the first scene and what is seen at the door takes away from the suspense.

You have been warned.First of, the game isn't necessarly bad, but the game is pretty terrible based on my own preferences.Pros:- Creepy at first- Freedom to exploreCons:- Small map- Obvious scares- Ridiciously difficult to survive (for me anyway)- Cliché and uninspired story-line- Very basic level designThis is what happened when I played:I enter the house and start exploring. I see a few scares here and there, most of them obvious onces, like a stalking doll, or a doll that gave me a jumpscare when I walked up to it. Scares every horror gamer out there have seen a thousand times before.I read a couple of notes from, what I guess is Emily. She feels like her parents never loved her and now she is haunting the house. I listen to a couple of cassettes from her mother that apparently delt with psychological problems, basic horror story settings. Nothing very intresting.Then, the clock tics and I notice it's midnight. From nowhere, a doll jumps at my screen and kills me. Game over...I restart from latest checkpoint and decide to move away from the killer doll. Apparently, she followed me and killed me again. Game over.I restart from the latest checkpoint again, knowing how to deal with the doll this time, or so I thought. The doll only moved when I wasn't looking, so I was constantly looking her way to assure she wouldn't kill me again. I entered a room and closed the door. Apparently, she could teleport past the door and killed me yet again. Game over.I restarted from last checkpoint again. This time, I decided to pretty much run around so that ♥♥♥♥♥ wouldn't catch me. I ran into a room I had not yet been in. A second doll appeared out of nowhere and killed me instead. This time I gave up and turned off the game.I died 5 times in less than 10 minutes.Maybe I'm doing something wrong, maybe I gave up too easily, I don't know, but this game was just too frustrating for me. Even without the annoying dolls all around me, the game wasn't intresting. It's way too cliché and offers nothing new to the table, at all. Level design is basic, story is unoriginal, scares are way too overused.2/10 - Would rage quit again."

The first and second rounds were very easy. Most of my deaths from Round 2 and 3 were from Mr. Tattles the clown, due to shaking from anticipation! Round 4 with Emily started out EXTREMELLY HARD because I had no idea on what to do. But after constant playthroughs it turned out to be the easiest round in the whole game. Round 5 has all of the enemies from the first three rounds including Emily. This was awful, but through constant tries I eventually bested it and made my escape! But It takes far TOO long in between rounds which works. It works in the sense that it makes you panic and affects how you handle the game. I do have a small gripe. Upon beating the game it doesn't give you any incentive to replay the game with new modes or heck even challenges! Whether I got scared or my friends did. I had a fun time and for the $4.99 price it's an experience I reccomend!"

,Not Recommended,416590,26449720,"Posted: 5 November, 2016",all,Guntario,"I do not recommend this. The game progression has nothing to do with the clues in the house. In the beginning, you have to stare at this doll to make it go away. There is absolutely no explanation to be found in the house. You just suddenly die. Crazy frustrating. I had to look this up on line, and even then, I had trouble with this portion, meaning that even though I stared at her, I still died. Not cool. I don't mind dying, if I feel like there's some sort of explanation on how to avoid it, or if the mechanics are done well enough that they make some sort of sense. But this is not the case with this game. Plus, the game's not scary, just super frustrating."

It used to automatically teleport you to the main room at midnight, but it doesn't do that anymore, thankfully. Normal teleporting works better now, but it's still acting weird sometimes, like dropping me in mid-air and then landing on the floor. I wish they'd add an option to use the trackpad to move (press or touch the trackpad in the direction you want to move) instead of teleporting. Also, I think there need to be more clues as to what you're supposed to be doing. You shouldn't have to look up a guide to figure out what to do (same complaint I had with The Witness, a completely different but cryptic game).If you're looking for a scary game, this is it. It's full of jump scares though. At more than 4.99, I'd say no."

I went into it knowing hardly anything about it (aside from the game description); this definitely makes the game more interesting. You roam around a house progressively trying to avoid creepy dolls that try to kill you. You use hints from around the house to figure out how to last during the encounter with said dolls. I avoided using spoilers and searching the internet for ways to do so with my intent being to figure everything out on my own. I recommend playing the game like this!

The scares in this game are excellent and the concept is amazing.Twitch LIVE Gameplay Highlight -Twitch.tv/halios00Live play of the game - Warning, Language is sometimes pretty strong.StoryYou are a pizza delivery guy. You get a call for a large pepperoni with anchovies to a home. Normal order, normal place, right? Yeah, that's what they want you to think. You arrive to a home that the front door is wide open. You peek in and yell to see if anyone is home. That's when your night starts. When it ends, Emily will decide.GraphicsNot the greatest. I don't believe the developers were going for futuristic graphics when they made this game. They made everything detailed but not cutting edge.Sound.....yea, they got this one pretty much perfect. God, I hate these noises.SettingVery creepy. The house is boxed up here and there, like the family is moving and makes for tense moments when you are trying to move quickly through the house. The home is small but seems huge when a scary moment is happening.MoodTense and scary. They captured the feeling of uncertainty and the pressure of fighting for your life beautifully.ReplayabilityYou WILL lose. And lose. And lose. Then you will start to understand how things work and start to succeed. Once you beat it, it would be fun to go back and show friends or beat again.Final SayThe premise, mood, and general feeling you get from this game is excellent. It's been a long time since I've felt this crazy tension that hits you the moment the game starts and it never ceases. It actually intensifies near the end, when impossible odds are placed against you. This live action Five Nights at Freddys will keep you guessing and jumping until the final credits.Final Score - 8/10"

Upon arrival, the door is wide open and the house seems abandoned, yet the family had just moved in. No one is home, and you enter, desperate to get out of the rain. That's where everything goes wrong. There are creepy dolls everywhere, and a little girl named Emily owns them. Emily is hiding, Her dolls are seeking. They stalk your every move, and If you spen too much time doing one thing, they will kill you. Find Emily, don't die.First, I was bored, and bought this to pass the time. I found myself jumping and screaming the whole game. (i have not beat it yet) It's cheap, and a great play. Hard, but thats ok. Scary, really scary.

Maybe wait for a sale to roll around to get it if you're just curious but other than that, it's still worth a buy if you REALLY love these kinds of gamesKind Of A Con But Mainly A Personal Annoyance:- after midnight, Emily can randomly appear inside a room as a static model and it seems like she can only kill you when your back is turned (like in SCP- Containment Breach) but other than that, it's kinda disappointing when you discover that you can just walk right up and bump into her so long as she's in your sight.  seems like that'd logically be an opportune time for her to jump at you.I haven't played long enough to get killed by the clown or the dummy since I chickened out after 10 minutes, but like I said before, I think this game is definitely worth the price tag to at least check out if you like survival horror."

I've gathered it must have something to do with the clock, which I cannot hear without audio.  But there is no way to enjoy this game in VR in its current state.I tried looking through the discussions to see if there was something I could do to fix the issues, but all I found were more people experiencing the same things and no help being offered whatsoever.It's a shame.

For an hour, you hear mysterious laughs when you stumble upon dolls that disappear when you turn your back.  For the next 4 hours (12a-4a), those dolls come to ""play"" with you.  If you don't play the right way, they kill you.  From 4a-5a, you play hide and seek with a mysterious little girl who kills you if you don't find her, and from 5a-6a you combine playing with the dolls and the little girl.While all of this is taking place, you are searching the house trying to find out what is going on.  Tape recorders around the house will tell you the story from the mother's perspective.  Drawings will tell things from the little girl's perspective, and at the end of the game, you'll find out what happened in the house... if you make it.You're bound to get scared during this game until you figure out how to play.  Once you've learned what to do, the fear diminishes greatly, although it can still scare you immensely if you're not paying attention!Have fun, get scared, and watch out for the basement.Teeheehee"

You play as a naive Pizza Delivery Guy who for whatever reason decides to wonder into a house when no one answers to take the collection. Once inside you find yourself trapped and at the mercy of Emily, a demonic woman with control of a spooky set of dolls. There is 'Kiki' the doll, 'Chester' the dummy and 'Mr. Tatters' the Clown, each of them has a different set of rules which must be followed in order to survive (which I won't spoil in this review) and each comes out at a different time of the night.This culminates in an hour when all the dolls and Emily are playing with you at once and the results are nerve wracking to say the least. Emily Wants to Play doesn't have much in the way of grand sound design, impressive visuals or complex game mechanics but what it does have is tension and a clever base idea... and a ton of jump scares that are sure to get you good at least once or twice.As far as these jumpy horror games go, this is actually one of the best I've played and it comes highly recommended at the low price point. Check it out, get scared and prepare for the inevitable sequel.Here is a video of the first 'hour' of the game for anyone interested in seeing it in action (and two grown men cacking themselves)...https://youtu.be/bRgdLUa8If0"
,Recommended,416590,19882659,"Posted: 23 December, 2015",all,Claytonious,"Like any budget horror game, take Emily Wants To Play for what it is. I will be honest, the first fifteen minutes or so are pretty scary. There is little in terms of guidance on what to expect, or how to play. This uncertainty contributes to an aura of discomfort that is pretty well done with the limited scope of the game. Unfortunately, this discomfort is conditional on a key assumption, namely the assumption that the player engages the game without help from a FAQ.The ""scare-factor"" of the game significantly declines after a few attempts. Without knowledge of the game mechanics, the game can feel like a stochastic whirlwind of scares. Yet, this randomness quickly fades into a discernable pattern. Once the player recognizes this pattern of game play, the game becomes more akin to a first-person horror platformer puzzle game.Recommended for its vision, but one must be realistic in terms of execution. I don't expect a $5 game to be the pinnacle of game design, so I think that it is inherently unfair to judge it as a more fully developed title.TLDR: Good for what you are buying ($5). Do yourself a favor and don't spoil the game story/mechanics when attempting to play. A good game to play in the dark alone, or with friends and beer."

I was definitely interested, and it looked pretty easy. Boy was I wrong! This game was definitely more difficult than I thought it would be, and scared the sh*t outta me several occasions. The entire game took me about 8 hours to beat from start to finish the first time around.i think that the game was great, but still had a few flaws that made the game a little aggravating. There were a few times where I checked every room and she didn't show up. The other characters appeared randomly, but once in a while would spawn too close to allow a getaway. Chester had a bad habit of going from room to room and hunt me down. Sure, they're possessed, but teleporting too?I definitely recommend this game, especially for the price. You'll get your money's worth in gameplay and jump scares."

There are no real instructions which leads you to discover things on your own. If you don't enjoy jump scares then you don't need to play this game.We played this game (3 dudes) while taking turns and watching each other's reactions. It can be fun if you up the stakes with a punishment for losing (eating gross flavoured jelly beans is our personal favorite). For a few dollars and an hour of entertainment for three people, it wasn't a bad purchase.Unlike FNAF, it can be challenging to figure out why exactly you died in-game. We looked up some instructions in the other Steam reviews which immediately ""killed"" the game for us. Without any knowledge it can be frustrating and with all the knowledge you're left with a deflated balloon. Choose carefully whether or not you want to spoil the win conditions for yourself.I personally couldn't see myself purchasing this game for me alone. Unless you're a very enthusiastic indie horror gamer (or you're streaming your gameplay), you may want to skip this short title. If you want a few laughs with your friends together with a few brown stains on your couch then Emily Wants To Play is a solid choice."

However, things take a turn for the worse when the police catch you trespassing on private property and the third portion of the game revolves mainly around defending the main character as the side character Phoenix Justice, to prove Pizza Man's innocence.  The game hits many controversial subjects such as lesbianism and child pornography, in a mature manner.

Seeing a lot of inspiration from other horror titles like Five Nights at Freddy's (Time system and enemy rules) and some other titles.This is not a ""collect 8 pages"" style game, but instead a pure survival game!*GAMEPLAY SPOILERS (NOT STORY SPOILERS)*The game doesn't give you full instructions, so allow me to explain it:There are four enemies in the game, three dolls and Emily.There are five hours of play, six in total (six is the escape)Each hour is roughly six minutes longThe order of spawns are: Kiki - Little girl in black (12:00am), Mr Tatters - clown (1:00am/Along with Kiki), Chester - man in suit (2:00am/Along with Tatters but no Kiki), All three dolls - Kiki, Taters, and Chester (3am), Emily - little girl (4:00am/At this hour, it is ONLY Emily, no other enemies), All four enemies - Kiki, Tatters, Chester, and Emily (5:00am), Emily (6am/Will kill you if you don't escape on time)Every enemy has its own rules, which are listed below:Kiki: When she appears (listen for her audio que, which is a little girl's laugh) turn around until you spot her, stare at her until she disappears. She will only move (and kill you) if you are not looking at her, so stare at her.Mr Tatters: When he appears (listen for his audio que, which is a demonic, deep male laugh) DON'T MOVE AT ALL, NOT EVEN A FLICK OF THE MOUSE! Stay still until he disappears (when he disappears, he gives a slight exhaling noise, but do not confuse it with any of his other noises). If you do happen to move, he will charge you and kill you.Chester: This is the tricky one. When chester appears (listen for his audio que, which is a high pitch male laugh) GET THE HECK OUT OF THE ROOM. You only have a few seconds to escape the room before he goes into a full on sprint to kill you. Make sure you keep yourself out of situations where he can trap you. Have many exits.Emily: Emily is going to be the biggest threat. When she appears, a 90-second timer will appear at the bottom of your screen; this is the amount of time you have to find her before she kills you. On her initial spawn at 4am, it will only be you and her, but at 5am the other dolls step in to play. Emily can always be found at any time by falling into the basement, regardless if the game has started or not.At 6am, the front door will open and you have only a few seconds to escape before Emily gets you.My favorite spot to play in is the living room, it offers many doors to escape from chester, three light switches so you can turn the lights back on.At 2am, you will only have Chester and Tatters. A way to beat this night easy is: The enemies will alternate in a pattern, Chester>Tatters>Chester>Taters...etc. Wait at a doorway and listen for chester to spawn, go through the door then turn around. Chester is gone. Remove hands off keyboard and mouse, wait for Tatters to spawn and despawn. Put hands back on keyboard and mouse and listen for Chester to spawn. When he does go back through the door. Rinse and repeat until 3am,Be careful with Kiki though, I've had her spawn without the audio que and sometimes she spawns in really weird spots."

However, I will admit some of the losses are pretty cheap, AKA KIKI comes out to play while im standing in a corner, I continue to stare forward and see nobody in the room...KIKI pops up through the ****ing wall. I jumped, but was annoyed with the crap loss."
