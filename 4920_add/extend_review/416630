,Not Recommended,416630,19899192,"Posted: 23 December, 2015",all,Elowan,"*May not be spoiler-free, but no spoilers that would not be found 10 minutes into the game*Before you downvote immediately for a negative review, please read the comprehensive reasons below. If you find that none of it was helpful, then downvote. Thank you.A bit of background on me: I'm a lover of visual novels and otome games, and have been for a few years, back when Voltage only had My Forged Wedding and Pirates in Love out in English and they were considered pioneers for casual visual novels in America. (PSP games didn't count for casual, since it was a console with a relatively small market even then.) Since then, I've played probably 30-40 visual novels, from the 20-minute to the 10-hour full playthroughs, and from PC to Android.When I saw True Lover's Knot, I went for it immediately after reading the description and looking at the screenshots. I'm personally a big fan of vacation romances, and cruises are my favorite type of vacation romance. The character art was gorgeous as well, and my initial assessment of the art wasn't incorrect. However, I can't say that after having played this game I would pay anything more than $0.99 for it. Here's why, in a short list format that I then explain in detail below.PROS:+ Gorgeous character sprites+ Random video sequences of cruise things happening+ Travel facts about European cities in ""guides"" that can be skipped, if desired+ A fun match-3 minigame that isn't too difficult+ Proper spelling and grammarCONS:-  ""No"" to a stranger on a cruise means nothing: CONSENT (nonsexual, see below)-  Short for the price, only a 45 minute first playthrough-  Forces minigames in otherwise pointless scenes-  Dialogue mundane and expositional at times-  My personal favorite character was not a love interest :(-  Can't overwrite save files-  Sprites aren't same size relative to each other-  Sprites sometimes enlarge and cut off the hair in certain scenes-  Audio overlaps weirdly in a certain scene-  Can't skip long animation sequencesEXPLANATION: Why do I not recommend this game?First of all, and the most obvious reason, is that this game is SHORT. A $7 game should not be 45 minutes long for a single playthrough, and certainly not 1.5 hours long in its entirety. I am a generally fast reader, and I see that other reviewers have had first game playthroughs from 1-2 hours, but that's still VERY short for a $7 game. I'm also certain I got all the dialogue I could squeeze out of the game, as I went back to the beginning and re-read all the choices possible, which was a massive pain because I could not overwrite save files and didn't know that when I created them (6 slots available).A visual novel is first and foremost about the novel half of it, and even discarding the brevity of this game, the writing still fell short. As in, it wasn't great, maybe not even good. No matter how gorgeous the art, few will finish a visual novel if the writing is poor, unless it is an H-game, which this is not, or very short, which this is.Most of the dialogue in the beginning centered around what the main character and her friend planned to do next. Scene-setting detail was bare and actual description of actions and events were uninteresting and gave very little feeling that the author knew what cruise entertainment was. A certain scene seemed to exist entirely to introduce a new character, who then had no bearing on the following plot, and another scene was entirely there for the purpose of making the player play a minigame.On the minigame, a small pet peeve of mine was that it's a software-based minigame that manipulates familiar file types for audio and images, which made no sense when it was deployed to unstick the coolant in a cruise engine. Another smaller mistake is that at a certain point, after choosing an option, a voice recording just keeps playing over the BGM even when you choose to leave the room. (The instance of voice acting is poorly fitting for the characters, one moreso than the other. The worse one seemed creepy at best and slimy at worst.)And finally, on the topic that cinched my disapproval for the game: CONSENT and how it relates to the main character's personality. When meeting a stranger on the cruise, he offers to sex you up within five minutes of meeting. If you choose the choices to decline further interaction with him, he then offers to show you around a Spanish city the next day. There is no choice here now; the main character will ""dream about him,"" accompany him, and continues to associate with him after that tour. The way the narrative was written, it was clear that to save writing the author just kept this character as the tour guide for the city, and if that meant making the main character choose to accompany him, so be it.Not only does this ignore the player's choices, rendering them pointless if they choose to deny the man, it also gives the feeling that if a strange man on a cruise offers to bang you and you decline to talk to him, you will still end up following him like a pup.Overall, I would not recommend this game. If it were free, I would give it a 5/10 (mediocre next to many free visual novels in English), but for the price, I would give it a 2.5/10. I would not buy this again under any circumstances, and hope that if you choose to purchase it, you know what you are buying at least a little bit more with my review.If you read all the way down here and still find my review unhelpful, then downvote. Otherwise, don't. Thank you."

The art style is nice (even tho there are some issues… Mostly with the proportion. Even so, the coloring was nice and the characters were pretty), but I highly disliked the BGs and the videos during the VN. In my opinion, it didn’t matched at all. I think that the game would be better with realistic BGs with filters (like in Higurashi), and with no videos. The soundtrack was good, some songs are catchy.The minigames were ok, but after a while they might get a bit annoying, and there’s no point on them: they do not have any influence upon the story. The VA by the ending was so bad that when I listened to Santiago’s message I laughed so hard that I chocked on my tea. That voice doesn’t match that character at all, he doesn’t sound sexy, he sounds like some stereotypical Spanish character, a very bad one. Scott’s VA was bad too, but far better than Santi’s.The endings were dull. The 3 endings are literally just a few lines, and that’s it, the end. This game had some potential, unfortunately it turned out bad. It takes effort to make a good VN, especially one dealing with romance; people will not feel a connection with characters after they speak 3 cheesy pick up lines. I felt a better connection between the MC and her best friend Lucas. It was nice reading their conversations, and I wonder why there’s no route for Lucas. He surely is more interesting than the 2 main love interests.Still, I wish the best of luck to the developers, and I will keep looking forward to their next releases.3/10. Get it on a good sale or better, don’t."

With mostly negative reviews I was going into it expecting poor content, but (not entirely) to my surprise I found that I enjoyed this VN.  Sure, it had a few flaws, but it was overall quite charming.  My only criticism would be about the pricing.  I bought it on sale for a little over $2, which I think is a much more reasonable price than the original simply because of the game's length.  My favorite part?  The artwork--the character artwork is beautiful."

,Not Recommended,416630,30916721,Posted: 2 April,all,Kit Moonstar,"Overall, True Lover's Knot is a disappointment.  While the concept is interesting, the game does not live up to the potential in it.  While I could forgive the fact that the background art and the character art don't always mesh well, the shallowness of the characters and the lack of gameplay options do the game in.  With such a small cast of characters, I expected much more depth and personality.  Two of the characters could be removed completely and not affect anything.  I also found Santi both extremely distasteful and rather creepy which leads into my other major problem with the game.  The lack of gameplay choices.  For example, I can't choose to avoid Santi all together and go on the tour with Lucas instead.  There's even a part where the choice to return to the cruise ship just cycles me through the same dialogue until I agree to spend the night with Santi.  I did appreciate the fact that I could choose not to end up with either of the love interests, but it wasn't enough to save the game for me, and because there are only three ending options, the replay value of the game is extremely limited.  The puzzles within the game also don't add much to the experience and are extremely repetitive   If you're looking for a a good visual novel style game, this isn't it."

Nothing truly interesting happens throughout the 1-2 hours it takes to finish it. Lucas is an ok character, but other than that there's nothing there. The love interests are boring as hell, the cruise consists only of partying, swimming and eating (I know it's like that in real life, but please make something happens!), and the weird match-3 minigame brings nothing to the game and is just in the way.I couldn't believe it, but the endings truly are abrupt. They couldn't haved rushed it more even if they tried.I'm just glad I got it at the goodbye discount, but even at that price it's not worth it."

I just really can't get past that you can't say, ""No"" to Santi. No matter what option you pick, you end up sleeping with him. Why give options if you really don't have a choice in the matter? Consent is important, whether in real life, or a game. I couldn't empathize with the character after that and I had the creeps to the point where I couldn't continue.Some of you might be into that kind of thing, and that's fine, but this is just a warning for those who can't really stomach that stuff.Other than that, the story is alright, I really liked the facts that were given about the places you visited on the tours, the stock photos were kind of amusing, the music was pretty nice, and I like the little mini game that pops up every now and then."

It's a bit better than Last Days of Spring, But not by much. The mini-game puzzles, I hate them. I get how you're fixing other peoples problems, But why not put a skip on them? I saved at the start of the puzzle because I often mess up, ((Current version of the game it offers No retry buton)) When I loaded the game it was stuck on the puzzle background with no puzzle to be clicked on, UGH. I had to start the game all over and redo a bunch of these ♥♥♥♥ing mini-puzzles. Then they added the color blocks with certain patterns, which is even more of a hassle. I tried for a good 20 minutes, failing and starting it back up. I don't think I will be finishing this VN. Theres also reused cut scenes and backgrounds, I already have a dislike with digital art ontop of stock image photography, But I wanted to give it another chance.. Atleast with Last Days of Spring it didn't have anything stupid to stop me from finishing each ending. I will not buy visual novels from Sapphire Dragon Productions again.Edit: After starting over a few more times, i finally made it to all 3 endings. Lackluster~"

Your ""friend"" and even some of the side characters have more depth.- The city ""tours"" are very basic outlines of culture, cuisine and economy, over a single static screen, reading a bit like Wikipedia summaries.- There are very few meaningful decisions. In the end, I think, only one.- After that particular decision, the ending is staggeringly short.- The puzzle minigame does add variety, but because the game is quite short you'll only actually play it a dozen or so times.- The puzzle game really feels tacked-on in any case. It adds relatively little meat to the game, while interrupting the (minimal) plot.On the plus side, the art is nice, as is the concluding song.A thorough waste of US$7. Get Clannad or Fruit of Grisaia or something instead. Costs more, but the amount of depth bears no comparison.

I mean, I was giving it a try and I actually finished the game in a go. The story is kind of normal and it's kind of funny to see that the characters are anime style and the backgrounds are actually photos. I would say they will look good individually but putting them together is kind of funny. Overall, it is quite an interesting one as it is the first for me but how I wish the story will be longer. I can't say whether it actually worth of buying but well, I paid for a game experience... It's okay if anyone want to give it a try but seriously, don't expect too much."

The characters clash with the background more than in most good VNs I played.  The characters dont look professionally drawn either.I could forgive that if the writing was good, but the pacing is dull and the jokes tend to fall flat.  I'll keep playing and hope things get better.  Hopefully I'll get my $8 worth."
