Because while you'd think your choices would matter like in other similar games, they really don't.  Most choices you face lead to the same exact results and I don't mean it as in the long run.  Let's say you have the choice between killing or not killing someone.  First run through you'll go with one choice and next one pick the opposite choices figuring the story would be entirely different but no.  If you choose to spare the person the game will let you but most of the time when you choose to kill the person, you'll either fail or be interrupted, effectively making the game painfully linear.You can't choose your own adventure, it's already been chosen for you."

You're in for a cartoony romp with a straightforward plot and lots and lots of deus ex machina if you play this game. I didn't enjoy as much as I thought I might but that was likely because I went in with the wrong attitude but I'm certain many people would find its silly and irreverent tone to be quite entertaining as long as they were aware of it before getting in too deep."

The writing is good, entertaining, and occasionally funny, but all too often the game railroads you into different choices. You'll be given a list of options, but the response will almost always be ""He isn't really listening"" or ""You thought I was serious?"" What feel like major decisions are quickly made irrelevant by randomly changing circumstances, and you never get the chance to truly direct your villain. The character decides their own overarching goal or plan, and you pick the specifics, which seems to me to be the opposite of what one would want from a game like this. Diabolical can be fun, but it doesn't offer nearly as much choice as you would want from a text-based game."

You can be a ""Technomancer"", but other characters are explicitly possessed of superpowers, and the technology is basically magic, anyway.All-in-all, it's pretty goofy, and wears its comic book inspiration on its sleeve, to the extent that it even tells you to read about name-dropped heroes and villains in back-issues of their own fictional comics, and I mean that in only the best way.  Taking the ""pragmatic"" choices are the sane ones, but I can't help but laugh and keep picking the ""theatrical"" choices that involve burning the money you stole, volcano lairs, and other feats of ludicrous supervillainy done more just because it would be hilarious than for any real purpose.  Even as someone who generally doesn't like playing ""Dark Side"" paths in any ""moral choice"" game, this game crosses the line twice and by a large enough margin to make it all hilarious.... Just don't expect to take any of it serously. In the opening, a security guard gets the drop on you with a gun, and you can somehow chloriform her before she can fire a shot at you... from several feet away, when she was behind you, and already had her gun out and ready to fire... So yeah, Rule of Cool and Sorting Algorithm of Evil is in full effect, and practical skills are useless against the Awesome But Impractical.It's dirt cheap, and it's worth a good laugh, even if it is a little short, even for an Interactive Fiction game.  My only complaint is that it could have been longer."

Not being a fan of Zork-like games I didn't take a liking to all-reading, no-action gameplay. But I now find myself wanting to play again and again, traveling down all the branching story paths I didn't take the previous time around. The writing in this game is phenomenal, with the humor being the strong suit. Many games don't make me laugh, and never with their dialogue, but I now have to make an exception for this game. All of the jokes are original and made me laugh a little more than I should have, which is kinda sad when you think about it. Alongside the humor, the descriptive detail used really scuplted the world I had pictured in my mind, further drawing me into the story. It wasn't hard to picture myself as the up and coming villain that this story creates by allowing me to choose how I felt on the matter at hand. Didn't like a janitor I found? Shot him. But when confronted with yelling at a waiter, I couldn't bring myself to do it and instead complimented him on his crude pancakes.

At this point you probably are a bit confused, so let me dissect the issue; In a ""Choose your own adventure"" game you are the main character, your choices make your personal out comes and paint a picture with the brush of your psyche: the game is a sandy beach and you the castle building child, each castle is different, yet all are clearly castle inspired by medieval architecture. In ""interactive light novels"" however, this is not the case; these games are more of showing you a(n) (almost) linear story, yet allowing you to be a part of the story, getting you attached to characters based on your actions, not to mention letting you feel the impact of the story first hand instead of the second hand method of traditional novella. Yet these two are not completely isolated from each other, rather they represent a spectrum of possibilities for games to exist in. Examples of games that heavily focus on only one side are: ""Long Live The Queen"" and ""Monster Loves You!"" for ""Choose your own adventure"" and ""Zombie High"" by Delight games llc for ""interactive light novels"".This game, while wearing the mask of  ""Choose your own adventure"", upon close inspection is somewhere around the middle, casting a wide net in a manner of speaking. A visible blow, in my opinion, to the overall sense and game play as this identity crisis chips away at a solid and enjoyable core.Despite my criticisms (including the fact that I still don't know if the game has RNG or runs on a flat number based skill check), I love it. Villainy is most often used as a gimmick, yet here you can glimpse at it being done well, and that alone was hook, line, and sinker for me. After all, villains are almost never main characters/well represented beyond one cliché or another (as playable characters, of course)."

If you wanted to play as a psychopath for fun, tough cookies."

There are a few where you'll pick a decision and the game will say, ""Just kidding, of course you don't do any of those things because they're silly!"" and it just feels a bit annoying all things considered.Ultimately however, it's still a great game. The humor is brilliant and campy and irreverant. From buying a gold-plated boat to playing a goofy comedy movie onto the surface of the moon, it's good for a lot of really great laughs. At least, the way I played it, you can also be the serious no nonsense kill everything in my way kind of villain if you want to be. There's a lot of choices, even if the story does ultimately have a few dead choices and a plot that generally goes the same way no matter what you do.End Result: 10/10, gonna play it again tomorrow. Another 'Choice of Games' adventure that I thoroughly enjoyed experiencing."

There are flaws (the ending achievements are mostly determined by one big choice at the end with your previous decisions not preventing you from choosing any option or unlocking ones from you) but the sheer ludicrousness of some of the things you can do and experience make the experience awesome and enjoyable. For example, there's a subplot about a pair of anchors who have a failing on and off marriage, a rural cop who has more ordinance than small countries, and school kids who will help you steal gold.The supervillainy/heroics are closer to something like Darkwing Duck, rather than your standard DC/Marvel parody.  The story can get dark (and there's even a lethality score to help represent  your bloodshed) but even the darker aspects aren't explicit.One thing I really apprecciated was the ""planning point"" system. While there are decisions that are locked behind your past choices (for example: If you didn'tenslave a character, you can't use them when an opportunity presents itself), there are also locked choices that require planning points.  You acquire them by showing your ability to gain resources or favors from NPCs.  Locked choices that require PP allow you to take flashier options to sometimes use all of the other options at once.  It's a fun mechanic and gives replayability to the game since there aren't enough points to cover all locked choices)While I still feel that Choice of the Deathless is COG's crown jewel, Diabolical is a lot of fun and well worth your time. Now, to make the greatest chocolate factory in the world...and keep all the chocolate TO MYSELF, MWHAHAHAHAHAHA!"

Along the way you face challenges from superheroes, law enforcement, other villains, and off-brand versions of a variety of famous characters.While the basic storyline always passes through the same outline, you have a lot of flexibility in how you go about your evildoing and it has a strong effect on how others react to you. I went through the entire story twice in a row, playing once as a Doctor Octopus type science villain and then as the Cesar Romero version of the Joker. Each time, the reactions of major characters and even my own best options in combat changed to match my villainous style.The only negative I can think of is that the romances seemed to be really easy to get -- to the point that I'd probably have to deliberately set out to antagonize those characters to fail at it. Other play styles might lead to a different experience, though."

What goons or super powers do you have? What is your characters gender? All of these choices are either picked for you, and never explained or eleborated on, or simply is never mentioned. The differences in the choices are also clearly limited, you cant be nice, you cant be mean, when your not supposed to be. Any choice that involves the illusion of freedom will of course never be mentioned again in the story.A minor complain in the face that its a story with poor writing, is that the stat fluctuation makes little sense to me.

It follows a strict format outlined by the company's website - players can chose male or female characters to play, and they will inevitably set 'orientation', as well as giving players an initial set up characterising their player with a custom name, abilities and traits.  In this installment, the player is a super villain... and I have to say it's easily my favourite of theChoice Ofgames I've played so far.The general plot pits your villainous cad, whether he/she be a technogical genius, a military tactician, or a frightening dark prowler, against the equally sinister Dr. Arachnus, who is terrorising the city... and who has made a rivalry with you a particular focus.  Through the various choices you make, Arachnus' plan is outlined neatly, and you're soon drawn against such other (deliberately) cliched and outlandish characters as The Drake, The Countess, and Agent Steelheart.  Whether your villain robs a bank with smoke and mirrors, hides naked in a vat of flour to make a raid (don't ask), or planting nanobots into the mind of a corrupt politician to ensure their later compliance, the acts of villainy you commit are yours to command!The game is simple.  No graphics, no mess, no fuss.  You read a page and when the page ends you get a choice.  When you take your choice the story will take you in a different direction.  Certain choices give you certain 'Planning points' that you can spend on restricted choices later - you earn them for being particularly menacing or clever.  It is possible to 'die' in the storyline so it's important to get as many advantages your way as possible - whether it be hiring a team of supporters to eatch your back, or amass enough planning points to get yourself out of whatever trap you find yourself in.  Along the way, choices give you stats, and these stats can also be used to influence the choices, especially towards the end.  Pay attention to what technological terror you're contstructing!!!Those looking for a straight laced plain jane comic book style story are going to be disappointing.  Instead,Diabolicalplants it's own tongue firmly in cheek.  Yes, your villain can do some utterly dastardly deeds.  The plot whilst filled to the brim with humour is ultimately quite serious, but along the way a good dose of camp and slapstick is played for jollies.  Ultimately, despite how amazing you make your villain, you can't get away from the fact that they're just a little bit... rubbish.  And that's OK, because your villain will ultimately become the King / Queen of Crime...UltimatelyDiabolicalwon't cater to all tastes as some will find it's light-hearted banter too comical, but others will revel in the pomp and circumstance, finding a well-written great story pitting you firmly in the driver's seat.  Ultimately for every time your character is defeated in an ignominious way, you'll find a super dark twist reminding you that being a villain certainly doesn't make you the hero!  One ofChoice Of'sbest and therefore recommended if you don't mind the format.  As long as you realise it isn't so much of a game, as one of those 'interactive gamebooks' from the 80's!"
