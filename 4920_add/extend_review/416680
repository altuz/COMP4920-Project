And a nice change of scenary from the hoard of zombie survival and wave mode games..You control the hoard.. In a 2d puzzle platform.. With challenges and diffrent goals, normaly its to get 1 zombie to the end so the infection can spread.. There's a nice variation of abillities and tactics.. And the more you unlock and further you get in the missions..  The better it becomes, Also harder. It becomes a trial and error.. And i can see perfectionist trying there best to beat all challenges..It's a tactic game and requires you to think ahead and plan.. As well as to adapt to the changes.. A elevator opens and suddenly a swat team steps out.. They can kill your hoard quickly.. How will you adapt? It's a nice concept and the art work reminding me of an old bit game with something close to the Ronin game.. It's a welcome sight. I highly recommend this game for thos that like some slow paced, Casual Singleplayer tactic game.. And It's a hell enjoyable to see your hoard chomp down on hundreads of running scared civilians, mobsters. Police and military personal..A 8/10 for me.. Clearly a good game you should not miss out on.."
,Recommended,416680,30544700,Posted: 16 March,all,Bass][e,"★★★★★A generic title for a very particular type of game, which will rekindle the love some players have with the childhood game called Lemmings. ZNT controls better than the before mentioned game, and it offers more variety while looking more appealing for any unaware passer-by individual. I feel like the level-designer thought out their levels and mechanics pretty well by, for example, introducing abilities by creating easy-to-understand scenarios which are suprisingly not as boring a the ordinary tutorial. Further more, they looked at the tedious aspects of Lemmings and streamlined those. For instance, where in Lemmings you had to (sometimes) command and click every single unit, in ZNT you can simply place one overlord-zombie who activites a command for any fellow zombie that comes in contact with it.The writers also did a great job by creating some extremely familiar movie and tv-shows scenarios, while creating their owns sense of humor and style. The team as a whole accomplished a interesting, lenghty game you won't forget anytime soon. However, for those who hunt for achievements, this game can be a nightmare, causing you to grind out levels for kills or reattempting levels over and over again in bursts of 3 minutes each. I tried to get some challenges done, but I came to a halt for those which required me to finish a level in a certain amount of time. The problem was not that I knew how to do it, but effectively commanding my zombies at the right time. One miss-click and ""Restart"" would appear on my screen again. For the more casual players, the last chapter (of 4) has some really tough levels despite the know-how. In these levels, you're faced with a force that might simply be too strong for some to be fun to deal with.This game is a blast, while being a nice break from the modern abundance of some game genres today.Update 25 May: One of my favourite games of the year added a free campaign. It just got better!"

This game also pays homeage to many other games, movies and music icons. For instance Daft Punk is featured in one of the levels. Each level has a unique side challenge that has no bearing on the overall mission. They are usually pretty difficult to do as well. I can easily see several hours of entertainment with this game. It's not particuarly difficult to learn and it's really fun to play. I highly recommend this game if you like puzzle games and zombies."
,Recommended,416680,26485499,"Posted: 7 November, 2016",all,TastyWheat,"If you want the pros and cons skip ahead, but first I want to address some of the complaints I've seen about this game (and why you should ignore them).""Difficulty ramps up too quickly"" - Now there are definitely some levels that are significantly harder than the ones before it, but isn't that kind of what you want out of a game?  You might fail a level the first or second playthrough, but then you squeak out a win, and that's much more satisfying than just blazing through every level.  Some of the bonus challenges are very hard, but it's none of them are required to actually win the game.""This game demands perfection/there's only one solution"" - I'd say quite the opposite.  I've played through each level once or twice (if only to get the bonus objective) and I definitely didn't beat it the same way each time.  It's pretty rare for me to just barely beat a level with fewer than 5 zombies left, because if so I royaly screwed up somehow.  I learn from my mistakes and you should be able to as well.""There's no checkpoints"" - Sometimes I do wish there were checkpoints of some kind, but if I screw up I usually screw up less than halfway through the level.  Even if there were checkpoints sometimes you can mismanage the zombies and the second half of the level can be very hard if not impossible.  If you know what needs to be done you can usually blaze through a level pretty quickly so this hasn't been a frustration of mine.So here are the pros and cons to summarize.Pros:- Fairly open solutions; definitely several ""paths"" on later levels- Levels are actually challenging, but not ""Dead Souls"" difficult- New abilities and hazards get added at just the right time- Not a bad story, but easy to skip the cut scenes- Cool low-res art style but still adds plenty of variation to maps and NPCsCons:- Timer still runs while game is paused (i.e. timed challenges are much harder)- No ""undo"" if you accidently use the wrong ability on a zombie (even when paused)- Unclear direction on some tutorials and boss fights- Use of ""zombie injection"" is uncommon (usually not important to overall strategy)- Hard to select right zombie when they're all clumped together"

,Recommended,416680,32148368,Posted: 3 June,all,marco,"In this game you play the part of the zombies, and the final objective is, as you may guess, to eradicate humanity.Your zombies will usually just walk straight and eat whatever they encounter. Your job is use a few tools to interact (jump, explode, run etc.) so that you can reach the level objective (which usually includes, but is not limited to, eating brains).People old enough will recognize the mechanics of Lemmings, but this game is much more than that.The pixel art is nicely done, you will find a lot of reference to movies and pop culture, the story is not completely braindead (if you pass me the pun) and more than else the gameplay is really fun.Every level requires a different approach to be solved, and many of them can be in fact solved in different ways. The levels are split in 5 campaigns, each one having a different theme and a different gameplay style.

,Not Recommended,416680,26470380,"Posted: 6 November, 2016",all,Justin_Brett,"Along with fighting them, controlling zombies is a surprisingly common trope in video games. Or maybe not so surprising: part of us does enjoy the bits in the movies where people get eaten, so directly causing that should be even more entertaining. That holds true for a lot of games - is Zombie Night Terror one of them? Yes, but with many caveats.Right away you might be able to tell some similarities with another older title, as ZNT is basically Lemmings with zombies. There's equivalent skills to the Blocker, Running and Climbing you'd do in those games, and some ones more suitable to the undead, like a scream that paralyzes humans and attracts other zombies. Unlike the furballs' colorful world, though, this game takes place in a black and white homage to the old zombie movies - the drug that begins the outbreak is even called Romero.Every character who speaks is some kind of jerk or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and watching them futilely run from your swarm is neat to watch, and takes off some of the boredom while your zombies travel from point A to point B. Some humans have weapons of course, and you'll need to use your numbers advantage and mutations wisely. At first you're just eating thugs, but soon law enforcement gets involved.When they do, in the second set of levels, is when I unfortunately feel the game starts to fall apart. I mentioned Lemmings before, and one feature many ports of that game had was an instant replay, where if you failed you could view your attempt to get an idea of where you went wrong, and even take control at any time to try something else. It was a nice quality of life thing.ZNT does not have any such feature, or any other kind of buffer. Lose all your zombies or get in an unwinnable situation, and you're doing the level over. This isn't so bad at first, but the game doesn't take long presenting longer, more complicated levels. There is a pause feature and fast-forward, but there are many situations those don't help with. Failing means doing all the stuff you did correctly over again for another chance at what beat you, and having to do that enough means you'll start messing up on what you did right the first time. I don't mind the game being hard at all, but in a puzzle game where you're not directly interacting a lot of the time, repetition sucks.I liked pretty much everything else about the game, but I feel like most people would get frustrated by this, so I don't think I can recommend it right now. If the developers patch in an equivalent system I wouldn't mind changing my review, though."

Huge fun and a real throwback to Lemmings, which was great fun back in the day, but this improves on that tenfold! Cute, but grizzly 8-bit style graphics, politically incorrect humour, a cracking soundtrack  (which brilliantly builds as your attacks intensify) and addictive strategy. It's that latter point that really makes this a great game. Some people will call that frustating to play, as it's challenging, but that to me is something very old school, normally missing in modern gaming. It's also known as lastability.

The game starts out awesome and amazingly fun, but you soon find out that as you progress the levels become insanely hard to the point of ridiculousnous. I'm all for a challenge, but this gets into tare your hair out frustrating (get to the mission ""Brain Dead"" and you'll see what I mean). There's some coding issues, especially with collision. Sometimes the zombies clip, and as some other users have pointed out, when that happens it can literally lose you the level requiring a restart of the entire thing. that'd be fine, except often when this happens it's after you've already spend 10 to 15 minutes getting to that point and now have to redo everything. Also, there's some game killers, on the aformentioned Brain Dead mission (which is a boss level) sometimes when you hit him with the cannon, he zaps the gun late and this makes him invincible. I've restarted that level about 30 times now because of that bug.

BAD gimicks, with as little spoilers as possible.. destructable terrain with limited zombie-bombs = bada map in pure darkness with non-renewable light-zombies who don't even provide much light = bad (game has no gamma btw, no cheating for us)A map offering 'choice' when really theres only one option = badand a mission that requires something Circumstantial that I never used it before and after the mission and it feels like it was put there just to screw with people on a mission that's already slow and pretty dull. (use the scream with a tank.. you'll understand what I mean when you get there)Now -overall- the game is fun, well made and yeah, its got bugs but alot fewer than i'd expect BUT be warned, some people have been getting black-screen or unable to even start.I can -JUST- barely recommend the game, for what it is, its alot of fun and £10  isn't too bad a price honestly, it feels reasonable for the offering here."

You can generally make it through many of the levels in multiple different ways, which really lends a sense of agency to the game that you don't usually get in puzzle games.The dialogue from the hapless humans you're about to consume is excellent, and the simlish-esque voiceovers make me chortle every time I hear them (especially when they turn into a choked scream midway through).All in all? if you liked Lemmings or have a fondness for 8-bit gore or have ever laughed inappropriately at a zombie film; get this immediately."

,Recommended,416680,24545303,"Posted: 26 July, 2016",all,dolphin,"*EDIT*: On DifficultyZombie Night Terror is a game that happily surprised me as I am not too keen on pixel graphics or lemmings style strategy. The game is essentially lemmings with zombies, but with a little more content than I expected. The game features a story spanning its generous 40 levels with some tutorial and story levels mixed in between them. Overall, I couldn't ask for a better combination of graphics, music, and gameplay.The gameplay revolves around using a mutation system to guide your zombies around that is incredibly fun. I don't want to spoil anything as the further you go in the game more mutations are unlocked. Each level also has a specific challenge to complete, and in addition there is usually a unique element tied to each level.*EDIT*Originally, I thought the levels weren't too difficult until I went back to complete them to finish challenges. The game unfortunately suffers from a break in difficulty where some levels are fairly easy but others are extremely hard or even tedious to complete. This is apparent starting from the first chapter and persists until the final chapter. The third and final chapter are the worst offenders where a bulk of them are difficult, yet a few are laughably easy (ex: 4th chapter 3rd to last level compared to the previous level). So, if you're expecting a smooth difficulty curve in the levels, it's not there sadly.The game contains a story that spans 4 chapters, and it succeeds in being fairly entertaining by not taking itself too seriously. In addition to the story elements, the game is riddled with a plethora of movie, game, and music references.Zombie Night Terror is one of most fun games that's come out this year, and has a lot of polish for still being an indie game."

Not only for the smart puzzles that mix up your goals and rules in inventive ways for every game, but as an homage to classic movies that reference Terminator, A Space Oddysey, Resident Evil, Mad Max and off course, the classic Night of the Dead series just to name a few.I'm not going to assume that everyone knows the Classic puzzle game Lemmings? In Zombie Night Terror, you lead a group of zombies across a 2-D cut out of different environments. Problem is, your zombies are pretty much... brain dead. Without your help, they'll marsh single mindidly in one direction until they fall to their deaths, drown, electrocute themselves, or get shot to pieces by a human populace that is consistently potraited as vain, addled, self-absorbed and idiotic. In other words, the kind of people that deserve a good zombie mauling.It's up to you te issue them the series of mutations, directions and aid to surmount it all. Need to keep them from drowning themselves? Turn a zombie into an overlord that draws them to safety. Need to break through a wall? Blow up a zombie. Need to sneak by an armed guard or climb a wall? Give your zombies claws and the ability to kill silently.And let me just emphasize how clever and varied the levels and puzzles are. In some levels, you go no holds barred total zombie apocalypse with hundreds of the critters, out in the street and overwhelming everything in your path. In some, you have just a single zombie that needs to stealthily sneak through an entire hospital or government complex on his own, creeping into the blind spots of armed guards. Sometimes you team up with other cult classic characters to overcome humanity, sometimes you even need to TEAM UP with humanity to save yourself and lay off the brains. Sometimes, your zombies don't even matter and you just need to survive.No single level is the same, the game stays fresh and interesting throughout, and the game will never bore or lose its shine if you're into puzzle games with a fondness of cult movies."

I enter the game and I immediately think to myself: ""This is some great music."" and then go to the first level. I notice the simplistic interface and I master it quickly. I reach level 3 and there's some really cool puzzles. They make you think. For the most part the game wasn't too difficult but I didn't just beat every level in one try. Then I start using the mutators and it adds a whole new level of depth to the game.Pros:Noir graphics and the ""Romero"" Zombie virus incites flashbacks to the good old days of Romero Zombies.Mutation system was done well and was a vital piece in making the game fun and complex.Abilities that can give your Zombies an edge or just cause havoc was cool.Ability/Mutation combos are great but the Crawler could have done with a few more.Fantastic music, seriously, I can't get it out of my head.Most levels are fun and innovative.Really great puzzles.Poor Zombie A.I.Cons:Poor Human A.I. (Made the otherwise fun mission Murderous Cortege nearly unbeatable for the wrong reasons).About 3-4 levels were so poorly designed that they didn't work properly (I assume they weren't working properly, maybe they were?).Buggy (Eh, what do you expect? It came out very recently as far as I'm aware).Bad Zombie graphics in comparison to Humans (All of them look the same, fat guys turn into skinny guys, Zombies have such pale skin that you can't see the eyes, etc, although this is much less important).All in all, I think the game deserves a 7.8/10 in it's current state, but I think it would be a 8.6/10 if the Cons are sorted out"

,Recommended,416680,24509555,"Posted: 24 July, 2016",all,piedol,"This is essentially Lemmings with zombies. A rather unique take on the concept that was executed to damn near perfection. Aside from a lone release-day bug that sees jumping zombies being stuck on walls, the gameplay, the artstyle, the music, and the comedic pacing are all executed to near perfection, with almost every level having some gimmick or on-screen drama unfolding on the sidelines to keep things interesting for those who take the time to look around.I can only think of two things that could be added to improve this further:1. A sandbox mode, because despite the lengthy campaign and its varied levels, the game does have an end. The levels (especially earlier on) limit you in terms of what powers you can use, while the latter ones are more focused on the challenge of applying what you've learned up to that point than goofing around with abilities. Choosing to just play for fun rather than compete with the obstacles that have been placed in your path could cost you your progress up to that point and force you to repeat the whole mission if you mess up. A sandbox mode with all powers unlocked and possibly randomized maps would do a lot for replayability without the pressure of time or losing being thrown into the mix.2. Rewards for acheivements. As it stands, you get nothing for completing the optional challenges for each level other than a green marker next to the level title indicating that you've beaten it. It would be nice to get some form of payoff for the effort beyond just the sense of accomplishment. Custom zombie sprites for each chapter of the game maybe? Just a thought.These are just wants though. As far as what the game promised, it totally delivered. Just know what you're getting: a zombie-themed puzzle game that's more about the challenge of micromanagement than it is simply going wild and throwing mindless legions of the undead at your problems until they go away."

Lemmings is a ton of fun and doesn't punish you at every given opportunity.In this game there's a timed level in which you must chase a couple guys through the streets before they get to their car and try as I might, over and over and over again my zombies would refuse to sprint when I clicked them, not break down doors I told them to or would ♥♥♥♥ up a jump which ALWAYS led to my intended victims escaping while I was only ever HALF way through the level at best.Demanding absolute perfection is NEVER fun, especially when, for some reason, everybody wants to compare this to such a fun game from my childhood I still have fond memories of to this day. If there are others out there like myself who loved lemmings and were thinking of getting this based on that comparison alone, think twice about getting this.

It eventually comes to a point that you no longer consider the extra bonus missions during the game, as just completing the primary mission is next to impossible. You never acquire a new power up or type of zombie to help overcome the next obstacle, you are given the bare minimum and asked to do the impossible.

I'm not comparing the games, I'm comparing the experience which is similar: the game is fun for the initial experience, after that you've seen it, that translates to: Minimal replayability.2. Don't give me the nonsense that a dynamic map creator doesn't make sense, look at many indie game and even flash games that give you map editors that randomly create maps for you, here the devs could create a few tiny puzzle templates and let the editor create a map with a bunch of these templates in random order with random lighting every time.3.

Like ""Lemmings"" in its time, the player must guide a horde of zombies to the end of the level or accomplish specific goals. Like the little rodents, zombies will walk straight, until the meet an obstacle (in wich case  they turn around). They won't stop for anything, not even a pit, and will fall to their... death...again... if you don't do something about it.The player has lots of options at his disposal to guide his horde and each level explain how to use specific ""ability"".You can create overlord that will act as a ""brain"" and give a specific direction to the zombies (later in the game you can use  more abilities on the overlord to overcome specific puzzles).Other abilities include exploding, jumping, running, ...I really like this game. It's challenging but not frustrating (except in some case). Some levels seem impossible, especially the first time you play them. But after learning how to solve puzzle (trial and error mostly), how the enemies react (some people have guns or weapons and will literally destroy your horde if you don't use your brain... uhuhu), you find a way to finish it.The pixel art is great, i love the music and the easter eggs to classic zombies movies are plenty !If you like puzzle games like lemmings, zombies and black humor, get this game :)"

You're tasked with spreading the infection, devouring those who stand in your path. This will require cunning and strategy, as many of these survivors are armed with weapons that can do serious bodily damage to your precious zombie flock. You'll have to direct, transform and sacrifice your zomblings in order to effectively overwhelm the humans.You'll have a command bar at the bottom of the screen - this is where you can promote your zombies to higher tier roles, such as an overseer who can help change the tide of the zombies, or crawlers which are more highly attuned zombies that can scale walls and enter vents. All of these abilities are priced with a cost - so you can't just unleash hell from the get-go. More command points can be earned through sacrifice of your own zombies, or alternative means.The game has beautiful pixel animation - bodies smack the floor with a satisfying splat, heads roll and bodies are ripped apart by zombie and weapons alike. It's a bit reminiscent of the fluidity you'd see from a Paul Robertson animation.Pros:Puzzle based design and plenty of variety in the challengesVisuals are fun fun funDecent amount of levels (40)Cons:Lack of checkpoint or rewind action can make some levels frustrating as a single mistake can potential force you to redo the level.The lack of color tires my eyes out after a while.

Worth trying.Game system: a plain zombie just keep walking in one direction until they go into walls, doors, or humans.  You have to control those brainless walkers with environments and special zombies with some abilities, which you can order them to evolve with some costs.Cons: Though this game is fun and playable enough, there are some improvements required. 1) Its GUI is too simple and small with a mouse and a keyboard, and descriptions are too short for players to understand the rules of the game.  2) There seems to be an error that timers goes on when you pause the game, in stages with Time Attack Challenges.  This can be the specification, and if this is true, there can be some description on it.  3) There seems to be only one right solution to beat Challenges.  More alternative solutions can make the game more enjoyable."

,Recommended,416680,26863199,"Posted: 23 November, 2016",all,TR-Jaybles,"Analazing the playstyle:It's best to describe it as a game where you lead your horde of zombies (or sometimes only one) though the levels laid out before you ""Point and Click"" style with the added effect that you can pause the whole game when you want and still adapt your zombies so that when you unpause all new mutations take immediate effect. This isn't needed in the early levels but later on it'll be just as much used as your upgrade powers and to scout ahead to know what your little throatnibblers will run into. Some levels give you wide variety of how to solve them and ther will always be 1 objective each mission you can or can't do to earn that elusive 100% complete icon in front of each levels name so there is replay value there for completionists.Graphics:Since it's a pixelated game this game should run pretty smooth on almost any system. Even on a Box o' Rocks. The pixel zombies even have shaders in different light so the fact that it's pixelated doesn't mean there isn't detail.Audio:The saouond is great the groaning, attacking, throatbiting and screams are very nicely done and fully synchronized with what is happening on screen.Final Thoughts:This game immediatly made me think of Lemmings 2: The Tribes I used to love a long time ago. Guiding your troops through a puzzle level was never more fun then Lemmings. But this game recaptures that sort of playstyle very well. So well in fact that I believe it set a new standard for that genre of game."

76561198123297981,Recommended,416680,26370809,"Posted: 2 November, 2016",all,TheAussieBlue,"Zombie Night Terror can be summed up with as a simple a phrase as ""Lemmings With Zombies,"" but to do so would be a great disservice to this game. ZNT is much more than that.The general premise of ZNT is one that's as old as the hills; you play as the overmind of a horde of undead, and must eat, devour, and consume your way to the end of many, many puzzles. Where ZNT differs is in the execution of the game concept. Taking a page from Lemmings you cannot directly control the undead under your control. Instead you use abilities and mutators to create new types of Zombies which all act slightly differently to passively change the behaviour of the undead.Don't want your zombies to stagger to their deaths over a cliff? Simply mutate a Zombie into a stationary Overlord, and all  Zombies that bump into it will move in the direction the Overlord points. Need to move up walls? Command your undead with a jump powerup to make them... jump... or mutate Zombies into Crawlers, which can freely move up walls.All standard fare so far, but ZNT goes a bit further with ability combinations. Zombies can't jump very high on their own, and making each Zombie jump is time consuming, so the solution is to mutate an Overlord, and give the Overlord the jump powerup. Now every Zombie that touches the Overlord is hurled into the air much farther than any Zombie can jump.As the game continues you unlock new ablities and mutators that will rapidly change your shuffling horrors into a true force to be reckoned with. From the lethal, ninjalike Crawlers, to the hulking behemoths of muscle that is a Tank, you can use a Zombie for almost every occaison. Each powerup can be used on each Zombie, but the true genius is that no two Mutants react the same way to the same powerup.Of course, a Zombie game is only as good as the opposition, and ZNT provides a wide variety of humans to much. Ranging from screaming fodder who can only run away, to ultra tough Zombie slaying heroes, ZNT provides a massive range of foes with their own behavoirs and weaknesses, all of which carry a disticnt visual style. It's easy to tell what a human does just by looking at them, and seeing a certain type of human walking towards your Zombies with confidence can fill you with dread.The game uses a very simplistic pixle art syle, but this doesn't mean that the game looks bad. Excellent lighting, smooth animations, and a crisp style makes the game look georgoeus, and no Zombie game is complete without gore. And ZNT provides enough buckets of it to fit the mood, without going overboard and making you feel sick. The music itself is fantastic, an electronic beat that dynamically shifts and changes to what's happening in the game. During quiet moments, the soundtrack is an eerie electronic organ piece typical of 60's black and white horror, but during tense moments of terror the music swells into a more threatening song that, despite the use of a bass beat and more aggressive music, doesn't feel jarring or out of place.Of course, the game has some flaws; the puzzles can fall into ""game developer logic"" that require a specific method to progress, and the puzzles can require a rapid change of tactics from one level to the next. From a level where violence and speed is needed, to one where careful planning and consideration, this rapid change of pace can result in frustration. The difficulty curve can spike extremely rapidly, especially towards the later levels, which can be extremely frustrating as some late game puzzels may seemingly rely on luck to win. Berhaps more damningly is the l;ack of replay value; once you've done a mission, there's not much reason to go back.Overall Zombie NIght Terror is a great puzzle game similar to Lemmings that is well made, free of bugs and failures, and is easily one of the better Indie games to come out in recent times. However, the game itself may not be for everyone as it's genre is a bit more niche than some might like. Well worth the purchase."

I thought this looked like a giggle and a bit of old school fun, but it's so much more than that. It’s funny, clever and really, really well designed.So it's Lemmings. It's not ""like"" Lemmings. It's good old Lemmings. With zombies. Even Jesse Owens can't outrun that obvious fact. But it's Lemmings in a dark and twisted sardistic kinda way. I guess it's the way us old farts that played Lemmings on our Amigas back in the early 90's (while watching a lot of really, really bad zombie flicks) really hoped a game like Lemmings would evolve one day. Or Devolve. Or mutate. Or whatever zombies do to people. And Lemmings.So your job is to guide a mindless zombie horde across a 2D level, killing those disgusting ""warm bloods"" and eating their juicy brains along the way - eventually creating more zombies. Traps, certain death areas, warm bloods with weapons and a lot of other hindrances function as the games puzzles and by using special lemmings... I mean zombies... who can revert the direction of your rampaging horde of zombies you can keep your braindead army alive. You can issue them with skills like jumping, climbing or dashing or combine some of the skills to solve each levels puzzles. Simple. Funny. Brilliant.It's a proper puzzle challenge, packed with 2D pixelated zombie brain-eating antics and other fun stuff. What's not to like - and it's even on a massive Steam summer sale? Wait?

Had great fun playing this game, partially thanks to nostalgia for Lemmings but also thanks to the original modern take on it with a zombie theme.Pro'sIt plays exactly like Lemmings; you turn zombies into zombies with a special function. It's tons of fun to ""puzzle out"" a good strategy.Clear tutorial on how everything works.Simple way of storytelling with funny cutscenes.There's challenges for every level, improving replayability. It's often a time trial or ""don't lose more than X zombies""ConsTiming was really essential for some of the levels. It made things pretty hard at times.I couldn't accurately determine whether I could take an armed guy without losing a single zombie, or ten. It felt random and that's not a good thing for a puzzle game like this.I didn't like the colour theme; it's basically greyscale, with colored highlights to relevant things.I'd definitely recommend picking up this game if you liked Lemmings in the past. And if you haven't played that game, definitely give this a try as it offers very unique and fun gameplay!Was this review useful to you?Please also check out the Izzy Reviews Curator pagefor regular updates on reviews for other games!"

For someone that always enjoyed zombie games, to be able to do the opposite of the usual, control the zombies themselves, Zombie Night Terror offers just that.It presents a minimalist story that you take part in directly, down the simple concept of spreading your plague in a multitude of levels. The lemmings style gameplay and the pixelated artistic presentation make this game throughly enjoyable, but the soundtrack is what drives this game home.A new feature is being worked on and introduced steadily: a level editor. I am still to try it in its full form, but when I do, I shall return to comment on it, as such a feature has the potential to exponentially increase the replayability value of the game.I recommend this game immensely, as it is fun, refreshing and a complete 180º degrees twist from the usual zombie game formula of surviving or fighting the hordes. Go play it."

Straight forward Puzzle game with zombies - just get your horde to the end after killing a certain amount of humans...Don't worry there is plenty of thinking as you move through the story.2. Interesting Story - I found the story rather fun and enjoyable to play. The bosses are also well designed to add to the pace of the story.3. A decent amount of enemies and units - You have a lot of different types of zombies to use from runners to tanks. The humans also have their share of units to fight back so be prepared.4. The only thing I felt they could of added was multiplayer where one player plays as humans sending waves of humans towards a zombie player (your basic push type gameplay). The way to win is to send enough units into the enemy base for it to be destroyed. But again this is an idea I felt could of been added but isn't needed for the overall enjoyment of the game.
