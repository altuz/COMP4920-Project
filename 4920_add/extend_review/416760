Like the title says, this game explores the dirty tricks that developers use to monetize free-to-play games. I haven't even finished the game as of writing this review, yet I feel compelled to review it due to the fact that its lessons are indeed valuable in detecting psychological exploits in free-to-play games. This game definitively states that everyone can be manipulated. First step to recognise when you're being manipulated is to acknowledge that everyone, including yourself, can be manipulated. If you keep believing that you're not one of those people, this game might change your perspective."

It's not a ""fun game,"" but it is one that players should try before spending real money in a ""F2P"" game, so you can ask yourself, ""Why am I spending money to make the game less frustrating?""I also think it has something for Subscription game players to consider: In forcing you to run long distances and do grinds, you are being asked to burn your monthly fee in tedium and less in content.Very educational."

,Recommended,416760,19772997,"Posted: 18 December, 2015",all,Potato Fires,"This game is ok, the idea of the game being funny and ingenious and the gameplay and quest rather comedic. One thing I have to complain about is the fact that auto-save does not work and there is no other way to save. Another thing is the reinforcement. The reinforcement of the rental items is quite absurd and has the odds against you greatly. I bought all the rental items and 66 reinforcement stones, 63 reinforcement chance up 50%, and 55 reinforcement saftey scrolls(eliminates the item from breaking if the reinforcement is a failure) and i ended up with nothing leveled up except for the rental sword which grew to level 7. I am very disappointed about these two things because this is a very fun game. Please either fix or make these two things easier to accomplish in a future update."

,Not Recommended,416760,32630324,Posted: 21 June,all,Dozenbeer,"The reinforcement quest made me rage-quit this stupid game. Its absolutely not worth the time and is overall a huge waste!Pros:+ the idea of showing off the ongoing scam tactics in MMOs with gameplay is greatCons:- the overall quality of the game is very lacking (music, graphics, leveldesign, gameplay)- you cannot die- you can add fictional ""real"" money to your account, but doing so is ungodly tedious, as you have to click like mad on a ""add"" button which only puts 0.20$ each click on your account.....imagine having to click up to 50$....why was this specifically designed to♥♥♥♥♥♥off the gamer.....its not even a good argument against paywalls, as actual paying is way easier- the reinforcement quest! That is where I draw the line. For this quest you have to reinforce an item at a blacksmith, but it has a chance to fail, so you have to use premium currency (thus adding more money to account aka clicking like mad) I had to spend 300$ ingame, which took a long time to click through, but guess what......after that you have to reinforce 10 more items!- overall this game does not capture at all how MMOs try to get your money, its way more tedious in this game right here as it is in real life and all the prices are overexaggerated to the max- its plain boring, every quest is a chore! There was absolutely nothing enjoyable at all in this gameHow ironic is it, that I had to spend money on Pay2Win and feel more scammed, than from any MMO that I can try for free until I realize they are too greedy and get out without spending money.....dont even bother playing this game for free. Its a huge waste of life!"

,Not Recommended,416760,19721704,"Posted: 15 December, 2015",all,Ticwith,"I do not recommend this game with a caveat.This game is not for a savy player it would seem. It is not an exploration of the strangenesses of the concept a la DLC Quest. It is more intended as an educational tool which I would say would best serve teenagers or possibly a younger audience.As an adult who loves games and has considered this type of thing, there does not seem to be anything new here. I did grin at the humor of much of the text and the sort of semi-intentional poor craftsmanship of the game.I just can't recommend this game, and I think it is because I am not sure who the audience should be. I want to say it is for the more naive, but the early introduction and some of the more blatant jokes about how bad games like this can get (the ones that tell you they are bad) seem like they would ruin the effect. I want to say it is for the audience that finds this topic interesting, but I do not think you would find anything new here, just cyinical jokes of the state of some of the gaming industry which, while entertaining, do not make up for the money _and_ time invested in getting to them.I will pick this back up, as it seems there may be more under the surface that I didn't hit in the first 17 minutes of gameplay.

,Not Recommended,416760,31669170,Posted: 10 May,all,Carl Max,"No. Just no. I get the point, let's inform everybody about how F2P Games really work their finances. Sure, sounds nice enough.It is nice enough, until you are about 45 minutes in and the dreadful reinforcement quest comes along. It is actually just the pinnacle of the ice berg, even after having read the developers' statement regarding this issue.The problem with the quest is, that it is no matter what you do, due to rigged chances, it is a MASSIVE timewaster. Even more so, if you do not have an auto-clicker installed, so if you really want this piece of software, get ready to download one somewhere. The entire game is based on wasting my time, even after the point where I would say: ""Yes, dear Developer, I get the point you are trying to make"". Why do they feel the need to torture me when their point has clearly been made.The developers' statement was all about how the he wanted to show how pointless doing all these timewasters are, which clearly, he has succeeded, but also has he succeeded in adding one more down the line. As one commentor on the forums said: ""You ****** me over more than those F2P games"", which is absolutely correct. Cannot recommend, go play Metin 2 instead and you have a real world example."

,Not Recommended,416760,19776607,"Posted: 18 December, 2015",all,Imban,"So, uh. This is quite accurate to what it says it's trying to be, and well done in several ways. It's not really a game, so much as an interactive lecture, but given that it's a lecture about how games are designed, using a game as the medium feels appropriate.I had some problems with a few times where I felt it was being exaggerated far beyond its source material, though, like the time you need to spend 9 hours or like $60 of fake money to craft three potions; as I mentioned in a feedback thread on that: ""The cost of accelerating farming/crafting times is WAY too high, even for the sake of example. It's not going to be terribly convincing when you ask a player to pay like $60 of fake money in order to not wait for 9 hours - most of those wait times accelerate for cheap, and even then buying them is generally considered a sucker's bet in many things, as the name of the game is managing your time so that you can log off and come back later when all of those things are done. Neither of those is the case here.""Unfortunately, there's a massive problem later on, when you have to upgrade several items to +10. What I had to say about that in the feedback thread was the following: ""The mechanics for upgrading items reminds me of actually doing that in a real MMO, where I had enough upgrade gems to almost certainly get my items to +10, but didn't want to sit there clicking the button for literally two hours per item until it succeeded enough times in a row. In that sense, verisimilitude! ...but I also got all of those upgrade gems for free over a long period of play.In this, however, it cost me like ""$200"", 10 minutes, and several trips to and from the vendor with the upgrade items to get one item up to +10. This is another time the prices are a little high - the new Neverwinter had ridiculous item enchantment costs at launch, up around $128 for a single maximum-power item, but you were guaranteed to succeed, and quickly, if you spent that much on it.Anyway, the point is I'm not willing to do that five more times even for fake money, because that's still like 50 minutes of my life. qq pls buff reinforcement""The developer posted an announcement here:http://steamcommunity.com/games/416760/announcements/detail/72420041513981709where he stated that the intent of that was to frustrate the player and drive them to find macros or autoclickers. I gave up on this instead, because needing to spend over an hour on one mind-numbingly boring step of what amounts to an interactive lecture......well, IMO, I got the point after the first ten minutes of it, and even that I felt was somewhat exaggerated compared to my free-to-play MMO experience.Anyway, yeah. I'll be seeking a refund since apparently that's working as intended, and as such I can't recommend this game (""game?"") to anyone. That's a shame, because it's pretty okay at making its point otherwise, and mentions things that I didn't actually know, like the purpose of those daily logon campaigns. Sorry, Bang / Best Gaem Studio.(As implied above, I did not finish this game/lecture/whatever, having stopped after about 40 minutes due to the reinforcement grind. I don't know how far that is through.)"

But was hoping it would teach me something I didn't already know.I guess It's just my fault for playing F2PMMORPGs since I was 15. (RuneScape, MapleStory, Mabinogi, Dead Frontier, Tera Online, Elsword). The only thing I really ""enjoyed"" was reading the lectures which I did find mildly educational. However, it's still not going to be much of anything new if you've already experianced alot of F2PMMORPGs.As someone has mentioned before in the disscusions boards, the prices on some of the items are extremly over exaggerated. I don't think I've seen any game anywhere charge $30 to complete a basic begginers quest. However, I understand it was for an extreme example's sake. Also the +10 equips quest was mind numbinly tasking to do simply because you couldn't just right click the items to put them in their proper slots, no you have to actually drag them to the slots. Be prepared to use macro's if you do buy this game.(spoiler? will anyone care?)faintly attempts amusment with a ""get strong and crush the F2P'ers"" quest at the end, followed by the game shutting down as soon as you become the best in the server.Somewhat off-topic (Topic of P2W games) : Tera Online is the LEAST P2W game I've ever encountered (I guess minus League of Legends?). You can definatly play that game and get very deep into it without feeling pressured to spend cash on it.Meanwhile Elsword is THE MOST P2W game I've ever encountered (But maybe that's because MapleStory doesn't have PvP). Weapon/armor enhancments work 100% in PvP. And Costumes give you stats + set effects + additional stat sockets (you can frget about maxing any stats without a costume).I've spent about $2,000 from 2008-2012 on MapleStory.And now in Elsword I've probably spent over $3,000 since 2014 began.Maybe have spent $100 tops in Tera, for cosmetics."
