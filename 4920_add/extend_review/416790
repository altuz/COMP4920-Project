,Recommended,416790,34926975,Posted: 13 September,all,Renegade Pige,"Can I just start by saying I really wanted to DISLIKE this game.  I am a pretentious DDR player who played for 4 years and beat almost all content DDR, ITG, and Stepmania had to offer.  So this game strolls along and is all like ""look at me, I'm a dancy game"" and I thought it was just stupid, I mean look at that guy with the afro, is he a wizard, is he a disco dancer? wtf is this game?!Then I played The Metronomicon at pax and ho-ly-crap I was instantly addicted.  Everything just made sense, the step charts were smooth, the rpg element was smart, the team building was in depth, it just felt right.  So the devs spotted me a copy and I streamed it for awhile hoping to find some aspect of the game I hated, but it just kept getting better.  This game isn't 90% dance, 10% rpg, it's 50/50.  Building your party is JUST as important as hitting the notes right.  I've kept in communication with the devs for awhile now (I stalk them on twitter) and they are seriously the most legit game devs out there, I mean their next tournament is called W.E.I.N.E.R and let's face it, any game devs that put weiner in their game deserves you to buy their game.9/10 point deduction because F&*% you guys, your game can't be perfect."
,Recommended,416790,28359477,"Posted: 14 December, 2016",all,"Kattanaita,","WHY DO I RECOMMEND IT?I recommend it to those who enjoyrhythm games:Amazing music;Fun and challenging concept, yet accessible to players of all skill levels;Beautiful and colorful presentation;Beat sequences feel natural and make sense in all difficulty levels;Game does not punish you (give lesser rewards/block certain content, etc) for playing on easier difficulties;Eight interchangeable playable characters and tons of accessories allows for deep customization of gameplay experience;Story mode is fun and characters are simple, but charismatic;Solid base soundtrack with over 50 songs, plus DLC is just as good;You can play with your keyboard, gamepad, dance mat and even guitar contollers from games such as Guitar Hero and Rock Band;You can import songs from Stepmania and make your own custom tracks as well with the built-in editor;Lots of challenges and replay value.IF I DID NOT, WHY WOULD I NOT RECOMMEND IT?I would not recommend it based onskill:It can be somewhat frustrating to grasp its mechanics in the beginning for those who have never/barely played a rhythm game since it throws you right into the fray with no practice mode — gotta learn by failing songs;If you're looking for mainstream songs, you're not going to find it here — you can make your own tracks, however, so you can add your own music to the game;It is a single player experience — even though there are 4 lanes, a single player controls all 4 of them at the same time;Not a biggie, and related to the first bullet point, but there's no ""relax/practice mode"" in which you can just play for fun and not worry about mistakes.SHOULD YOU/OTHER PEOPLE BUY IT?It depends on your answer to thefollowing questions:Do you like DDR (Dance Dance Revolution) / Stepmania?Do you like rhythm games in general?Do you like Rock Band/Guitar Hero?Do you like RPGs?Are you looking for an original, fun concept?Single player experiences mean more to you than multiplayer/co-op ones?If you answeredYESto2 or more questionsabove, I'd strongly recommend it to you. It is one of those rare, precious concepts that only come around every once in a long while, and, for the price, you get a big bang for your buck.The Metronomicon is a mix of DDR (Dance Dance Revolution) and other rhythm games such as Rock Band/Guitar Hero. The DDR aspect is that you have four arrows coming down a lane and you must hit them mostly according to the beat of the song (as opposed to mimicking instruments in games like Guitar Hero) as they pass through a threshold at the bottom of the lane. The Rock Band analogy comes in the form of four different lanes that sort of mix beats and certain instruments, with certain lanes being more difficult/having more notes than others.You have three attacks/spells that you can trigger by hitting those beats in streaks. A certain number of beats will trigger an attack, and longer streaks allow  you to trigger those different, higher level attacks.The innovation and challenge comes in the form of four lanes that you must manage at the same time, according to your needs. It is certainly a lot of information to handle in the beginning, and I gotta say that the difficulty is pretty high for beginners. The game expects you to have at least some familiarity with rhythm games, which is both a blessing and a curse.For instance, none of my friends wanted to even give it a try because they thought it was just too much for them to handle. It can be intimidating. Keeping the beat and hitting notes in sequence is hard enough by itself on a single lane, let alone four of them, while you also have to keep track of your health, the enemy's, status effects, strategy, vulnerabilities, openings and special attacks.For beginners, maybe there should be a mode with only a single lane in a tutorial mode of sorts. Or at least a practice room. The tutorial that is in the game now teaches the basics competently, but you already start with four characters and for those who still need to get used to rhythm games it is a hurdle they are mostly often not willing to overcome.On the other hand, this game has lots of charm. I was pleasantly surprised. What attracted me the most was the premise of controlling several characters in a RPG-like environment through the mechanics of a rhythm game. I must confess the trailer on the store page is very confusing and frustrating, as I was hoping for at least a demonstration of the mechanics, but they make it funny and flashy at the expense of actually presenting the game in a clear and concise way for newcomers. I appreciate the flashy presentation, but a second video showcasing gameplay would be very welcome; I tend not to buy games without having a clear understanding of their core mechanics beforehand, and I suspect some other people might be as bewildered as me the first time I came across this game.That aside, the amount of polish and love this game has is amazing. The developers are truly passionate about it, and you can see that love clearly even on their store page, with beautiful graphics and colorful descriptions. It is one of the best looking store pages I have come across on Steam in many years. The same care and polish is in the game itself, with its environments, enemies, menus... everything is very bright, colorful and so beautiful and fun to look at. Animations are hit and miss, but given this is an indie developer, you gotta hand it to them for adding so much detail in what must've been quite a tight budget.Another plus is that the game is very generous with new players. Want to play on easy? No problem! You get the same rewards as anyone else. Difficulty changes only the amount of beats/notes you get per segment, and that only affects your score, for leaderboards purposes.I myself am not very skilled. I am very uncoordinated, but I love rhythm games. I find it appealing that you get the same rewards no matter the difficulty you play in. That is a great way to balance the game for many different skill levels. I love playing the songs on easy and just relax after a long day at work. If I'm feeling adventurous, I play one or two of my favorite songs on hard, and after a couple of songs I feel very accomplished and entertained.I used to be a big fan of DDR back in the day. Unfortunately I developed a serious knee injury and had to stop playing on a dance mat, but I kept playing on the controller on my old PSX. This game is an improvement on all aspects of what made rhythm games fun for me. The soundtrack is very diverse and excellent, and I gotta say I appreciate the lack of mainstream artists... it makes it feel unique, all the while presenting excellent artists that for sure deserve a lot more attention; an amazing showcase, for sure.What worries me is that a lot of people are requesting co-op/multiplayer, and it would be quite sad to see the game change focus from a single-player experience to a mutliplayer one. I wouldn't mind a multiplayer mode, but I feel that fundamental changes would have to be made to the game for that to happen, and that could change the core experience of the game.Anyway, those are my two cents.As always, the final choice is up to you.Go there, save the day!"
,Recommended,416790,32041912,Posted: 29 May,all,bubdude1494,"i just want to preface this review by saying that at the time of writing this, i have played very little of the main game. what made me want to buy this game more than anything however is the amazing developer of the game that i had met at momocon 2017 and the demo that he had set up there that i just couldn't help but return to every chance that i got.as he had explained to me, this game is a rhythm-based rpg with all of your typical rpg tropes (leveling, gear, skills, etc.) but it is all controlled by the power of dance. in a very ddr/stepmania fashion, you hit falling arrows in time with the music in order to cast abilities and while an ability is being perfomed, they will have a recovery period so you need to keep switching between the heroes in your party to make the most use of the time you have in the song.the game has a sense of style that shows the care that went into the game and stays consistantly bright and high energy as you progress. the track list is just as high energy and even features work from jimmy of mindless self indulgence (seriously, look up ""fighting with the melody"", it's fantastic).the demo was a blast to play and i can't wait to dump multiple hours into the full game."
,Recommended,416790,32760593,Posted: 25 June,all,fia,"Before I start I'm going to say that I have played very little of this game but boy did it leave an impression on me.I looked into this shortly after quitting Crypt of the NecroDancer (I am terrible at roguelikes) and thought it looked pretty good, but I wasn't too sure about it. So I waited until a sale to get it.First off, this game has a really great soundtrack (not like I'd expect any less from a rhythm game). It has nice visuals and an interesting premise as well as a unique execution. However, to me at least, it feels less like a rhythm RPG and more like a rhythm game with added RPG elements; enemies don't have HP so attacking them does nothing more than rack up points, fights end when the song ends, you even traverse the regions by selecting songs.TLDR it's good but has a way bigger emphasis on the rhythm aspect than the RPG aspect."

So far i've heard 14 of the 38 songs and have done most of them on easy and medium difficulty, with a couple on hard.I was initially worried that having 4 scrolling bars along with health bars, abilities, and enemies to keep track of was going to be a bit too much, but i was gladly wrong.  The use of colors and highlighting is subtle, but really helps bring everything together and makes it easy to get all the information you need at a quick glance.There is a quick and easy tutorial which does a good job introducing all of the mechanics.  It was short, informative, and didn't overstay its welcome.The soundtrack so far has been amazing, great songs that work well for all difficulties.  Sometimes in DDR/Stepmania songs can seem harder on lower difficulties because its difficult to simplify the beat, but i have yet to experience that.There's also a lot of replay value. The arena is updated after beating each zone which offers preset challenges to face.  There is also a lot of customizing you can do with party selection, equipment, ability order, team attack, and passive selection that lets you change the play style so the experience is different.  While some items are stat sticks, there are some available that can drastically change how you play.They also recently added the ability to create your own tracks as well as support for stepmania file types so tons of replay value there.Though not something I personally care about, they do keep track of your best score for each song/challenge, as well as show you leaderboards for the community which could be a plus for some people.Support is ongoing, they have released a couple song packs which add some songs and a special item to get for each song at very reasonable prices.  I expect i'll be picking these up during the next holiday sale after i've beaten all the default songs and challenges.Controls are easily customizable which was good because i wasn't a fan of the default layout they had set up.  They mentioned controller support but I have yet to try since i'm happy with the arrow keys.I think the only negative i can think of is the lack of mouse support for the menus, but it is functional with the arrow keys as if i was using a controller.Overall, i highly recommend this game if you are a fan of rhythm games and/or stepmania.  I can already tell this is going to be a game i keep coming back to after i finish all the story missions and challenges."

,Recommended,416790,25827115,"Posted: 2 October, 2016",all,Ryan Dorkoski,"Absolutely outstanding game that blends the RPG and rhythm genres near perfectly.The trailer didn't sell me on this particularly well, either. I watched a friend play for a bit and decided to take the plunge. And I'm really glad I did.The Metronomiconis highly polished, overflowing with content, and most importantly - reallyreallyfun.I find it hard to turn it off, honestly.Essentially, when you complete sequences of dance moves by matching the arrows, you perform some action like attack or heal, etc.You can choose what action you perform by how long you keep the sequence going. There is a lot going on, and I mean that in a good way. Pitting elementals against each other is how you exploit weakness (ie. fire kills lush earth, and water kills fire, and so on). You get equipable and functional loot. You build your party and swap different classes in and out. There are different modes and they are all really well done.The music is high energy and quite varied. There is a lot of it, in my opinion. I hear there will be more coming as DLC, which is awesome.It is also my opinion that the worst part of this game is debatebly the artwork.It is nothorribleper se, but I just wish it were different. At least the animations are funny with how their hips gyrate lol. The enemies have a lot of 'character' lol.Pros:+Really great blend of two genres that makes for some very addictive gameplay. I have a hard time putting it down.+Controller support is good.+Tons of content. I could see getting dozens of hours out of this.+I like all the different modes and interesting play mechanics. One really neat thing was the firey rain that you had to 'catch' before it fell on your party at one of the boss fights.+Music is pretty great. Really high energy and there are a lot of genres in there.+Animations follow the beat and are pretty funny.Cons:All of my 'cons' have been addressed =D-If you want to hit two buttons at once to capture a double-note, you have to use both pads. You should have the option of just using one pad to do this. Doesn't make sense that you don't.-Maybe this is a thing, but I think we should be able to input our own music like you can inCotND. Not a major flaw. In fact, more of a suggestion.-Artwork is 'meh' IMO.This is a must-buy if you like rhythm games."

That being said, I have one gripe that stops me from playing this game as much as I might otherwise, and that's the size of the lanes. So much of the screen is dedicated to the rpg elements of the game that the notes end up with too little real estate. As jarring as it might feel, zooming the lane you're playing on to the height of the screen would make reading these tracks so much more enjoyable in my opinion."

,Recommended,416790,32894250,Posted: 27 June,all,MeMosh,"I've been waiting for a game like this since I played the RPG bejeweled spinoffs from popcap.Having played a lot of rhythm games including all the Konami's DDR and the Benami's Pump it UP! I develop a taste for games where music is the primary focus of the gameplay, that is, learning to react the the notes in a base level that alows you to tackle any song at some degree, and learning the songs' tricky parts. This game provides all of that since it doesnt randomize the notes like others do.The other aspect of this game is the RPG mechanics, they're very well implemented IMO, very similar to the Bejeweled RPGs where you equip skills that can serve you during the gameplay by giving you a way to executing them during the round, in this case, becoming a section of the song that you have to execute without mistakes to trugger the skill. These skills also have a cooldown during which youll be switching to your other characters to use their skills, they whole thing has great pacing and you never feel taken out of the song's rhythm.My only problem is that I wish the arrows were actual arrows (with a tail) as opposed to triangles since sometimes, my brain will get confused and start looking at all the notes as the same triangle.Recommended."

Basically, arrows scroll down the screen and by hitting the correct arrows for different lengths of time, you cast different spells. You can change ""lanes"" to different party members to cast different types of spells, and you level up and get items to make your characters stronger. The soundtrack is nice and the gameplay is great. I'm sure it's not everyone's cup of tea, but if you're reading this review, there's a good chance you're interested and that you'll enjoy it."

Are you an RPG fan looking for something completely different? Do you wish to do battle with a Giant Tentacle Monster with glow-in-the-dark body paint?If so, look no further than The Metronomicon.Developed by Puuba and published by Kasedo Games, The Metronomicon is a Rhythm/RPG game. Simply put: it's what would happen if you took away the menus of Final Fantasy, and replaced them with four music tracks in the style of Guitar Hero, Dance Dance Revolution, or Rock Band.The resulting game is near-perfect blend of the two genres, with players having to think, strategize, and time their skills correctly to destroy their enemies, buff their allies, and keep the team alive, while also giving an immediate (and if I may say so myself VERY fun) challenge with trying to hit a long enough series of notes to actually cast those spells and abilities.This, accompanied by the incredible soundtrack,* a great amount of choice and depth with the player characters, and the many interesting and unique difficulty modifiers make for a great game with a lot of content and tons of replayability—whether you're an expert gunning for the top spots on the leaderboard, or a newbie who keeps dying but keeps coming back for the music and the fun.The GoodBlended To Perfection– Match your attack's element to your enemy, get massive damage. Achieve a high streak in the double digits, watch your teammates perform new attacks and abilities that help lay the smack down on your enemies. Do both, and decimate your foes.Neither the RPG or Rhythm Game elements are overwhelming the other, or just feels like a gimmick—both systems are woven together, and quite well.Accessible- Not so great at rhythm games, but a master at RPG mechanics of abusing enemy weaknesses, healing, and buffing? You're good, the game provides items that give flat stat bonuses and a leveling system to gradually overpower the enemies and destroy them through superior stats. Great at rhythm games, a master of high streaks, not so much the synergies of abilities? You're also good, the game also provides items that provide boosts for the streakers among you. Suck at both? Don't worry, the penalties for missing notes and breaking streaks is very forgiving, and the Easy mode is just that—a great mode to learn the nuances of Rhythm games without the game over screens.Variety For Days– You know that old saying, 'Variety is the spice of Life'? The Metronomicon has it in spades.With the music, unless you've got a thing against modern music like rock and dubstep, you'll most definitely find a handful (or a lot of) songs that you will replay the stages of constantly or chill out with in the DJ Room.With the combat, you can mix and match to your heart's content with a very deep system. Do you run with a full damage build of a Berserker, a Thief, a Warrior, and an Exploder, believing that the best defense is kersplodinating everything before it has a chance to even attack? Do you play the Protector more as a tank, soaking up damage for the rest of the party, or as combat support, stunning enemies, dealing damage right back, and even healing the party? Do you want to take advantage of your streak building skills and use an item that automatically buffs your party as you hit the upper double digits, or do you use an item that gives your characters a substantial raw boost in power standard?And if you find vanilla combat too easy or too boring, there's also a large number of ways to vary up your experience. Too easy? Rack up the difficulty. Looking for something different? Try the arena challenges, where you fight with preset teams, and have modifiers like constantly falling rocks to dodge, spinning and wobbling notes, or trying to “befriend” monsters for an entire song, healing and defending yourself as they try to rip your face off.Awesome Music, Awesome Track Choreography– Worried that the notes won't match up, rendering the music background noise to a game of memory? Fear not: from my experience, all three difficulties and all four tracks at any given time sync up to the music, and you can even adjust the latency of your inputs for devices and monitors with delays.Silliness– A fantasy world is being terrorized by mysterious night clubs falling from the sky, attracting monsters who destroy everything around it by morning. A school is established, teaching humans how to dance and fight at the same time, in an effort to produce graduates who will infiltrate these parties, shut them down, and ultimately destroy the source.The Metronimicon is very, very, VERY aware that this is a very silly plot, to say the least, and it runs with it.Your black mage Violet is called the “Exploder” and true to form, she's positively giddy at the prospect of “kersplodinating” legions of bad guys, and any day where the world is due to be destroyed and she needs to blow up the biggest baddie in the world is a great day indeed. Enemies include haunted disco balls that produce weapons and tools out of neon lights, feisty hermit crabs wearing sweet bling, mermaids with rayguns, giant bears in wife beaters, the aforementioned giant tentacle monster with neon glow-in-the-dark face paint, and even creepy tiny lizards who need to stand up on a box to actually reach you. The descriptions for your sidequests involve saving the arena's hotdog stand from ravenous monsters, wearing experimental shades from the laboratory that make you completely colour-blind, and going through three strong straight while the arena mistress goes off for lunch.And this isn't even getting into the equipment, like the “Dirt Endirtener” which is useful for killing lightning elementals and building sick sandcastles, the “Full-Body lipgloss” that'll make you shine like the sun, and the “Bottom Flappy Bit,” the most important part of any piece of armour that you should open before using.In an industry filled to the brim with games trying to be taken “seriously” with “mature” plots and themes, The Metronomicon bucks that trend with a swift kick that's part of a sick series of dance moves, all to the tune of awesome music.The BadThe Buff and Debuff UI– Both are given as tiny icons on the bottom of the screen, with only two colours: opaque “active” and a blinking” about to “wear off” mode. Neither are very helpful in terms of information, how long it will last, and oftentimes, you'll have to develop an instinct to know how long a certain buff lasts before you need to cast it again—and oftentimes, in the heat of a complex series of notes, you really can't check and only notice until it's long run out.Silliness– Obviously, such a lighthearted, not-serious, and colourful game will have people that find the humour and the comedic elements lacking, annoying, and falling flat.Should I get this?Absolutely. Rhythm game fans, RPG fanatics looking for something different, even just people willing to jump into a new genre if it means getting away from the “Gritty, Realistic, Modern” games and their “serious” plots for “serious, mature” trend the AAA industry is so keen in going down.Buy it, play it, tell your friends about it—The Metronomicon is a real gem that is more than worth your time and money.* Favourites include “Live It Up” by Shiny Toy Guns, “I Thought The Future Would Be Cooler” by YACHT, “For The Love Of God” by Rosie, and of course, the game's theme song: “Fighting with the Melody” by Jimmy Urine of Mindless Self Indulgence."

Did I say it was addicting?Pros:- Incredibly fun mechanics (Swapping lanes, picking abilities)- Long list of fantastic music charts- Stunning visuals with great art design- Original and fresh themeCons:- Story: Not the biggest factor in a rhythm game, but could use more loveHonestly, I can't recommend this game enough.

I could go on and on about it but among the best things to say:Great music: A ton of great tracks, all of which I had never been exposed to before.  Some of the tracks are specifically made for this game and I like nearly all of them.  I didn't buy the accompanying soundtrack at first, but now I'm considering it.Fantastic difficulty curve: This one is important, I was kind of worried when I first tried some hard songs that I would never get good enough to beat them.  A couple weeks in, and I can beat every song on hard and am working my way up on some leaderboards.  It really is addicting because I never felt ""stuck"" in the game where I stopped accomplishing things.Cool RPG elements:  At the end of the game, you have enough equipment and unique abilities to really create some special task forces for accomplishing certain goals (like most damage on a song, most enemies killed on a song, most spells cast).  Creating a party around specific goals is actually really fun too, it's not just all about the rhythm game!Overall for a summary of the game, I would definitely say this is a rhythm game first and an RPG second.  But it's a really well done fusion of the two.  Pretty much all skill levels are welcome; I think most anybody should find easy doable, many can probably jump in on medium.  I will say if you are some kind of pro at StepMania or FFR on keyboard controls, then even the hard difficulties on keyboard might be a bit easy (I've seen what you people can do!).  That's just because these tracks  were all handcrafted to be dance pad friendly."

I could play on easy,but the thing is, it makes it easier by reducing the number of notes, and there are abilities that activate passively when you hit a certain number of notes-- meaning those abilities will trigger less. Maybe I'm misunderstanding how that mechanic works but that seems a little unbalanced to me. Otherwise,(Correction, passives are triggered after beats, not notes) I really like this game."

However, what is unique with this is it adds 4 tracks that you must switch between in order to cast spells. You follow along the same track for up to 3 spells, then switch to the next character and choose between 1-3, switching to continue your streak.This has all of the standard gimmicks that are in DDR, ITG such as spinning arrows and mines, etc. This adds spells that the monsters also cast on you which even if you are great at keeping a streak going, adds a stradegy element into the songs. I am at the boss song in world 3, and even on Easy i am seeing some crazy stuff being thrown at me. It gets tricky.Pros:Awesome varied soundtrack especially if you like VGM (Video Game Music)Side Quests during the story such as combo streak and damage challanges.Automatically Updated Ranking System so you can see how you average against other players.Controller SupportVoice acted story with great artwork and little animations.Weapons and Accessory Perks to equip your team.Multiple characters unlock as you progress in the story.Friendly developers that keep in touch with the community, who are open to suggestions and ideas.Controls can be changed and configured.Cons:Lag - Numero Uno problem with me, unsure if its my computer.

I found this game to be truly exhausting to play because of how hard I had to focus in order to play effectively (Sort of ties in with the previous point.)- It can be very difficult to do guitar parts on higher difficulties on a keyboard (My fingers are already clumped up on WASD and you expect me to do constantly changing chords in rapid succession? Or to shred up and down the 'fretboard'? ♥♥♥♥ that noise.)Even those that last point probably sounds like I'm really complaining, it's honestly not that big of a deal. Let me put it this way, I was able to beat the entire game on Normal with relative ease. A couple songs gave me a little trouble, but it only took me a couple of tries for those trouble songs. However, if you want a REAL challenge, Hard will give you just that. Buut if you really can't be bothered, Easy is about as baby-mode as baby-mode can get.So, yes, I absolutely recommend this game, as I thoroughly enjoyed it and any problems I had with the game were almost entirely my own, and not necessarily any fault of the game.Oh, one final note; I wouldn't mind either a Metronomicon 2, or more actual DLC.Also I think the ability for user-created songs/beat-maps would be absolutely fantastic.Just added that with a recent update.

At the same time, you go along with the music to have your party's skills actually trigger. It's not too complex, but has a bit more to it than say, Before The Echo. Also no grinding necessary, which is always nice.What really sets it apart is the soundtrack. It's good. Fantastic, even!

Adding some kind of minimalist sound to when you hit a note properly would enhance the experience plenty.* While it touts the game as a blend of a rythm game and an rpg, what really bugs me is that you get damaged from enemy attacks but ALSO when you miss a note in your string. So sometimes I'm having to deal with a tough enemy, get distracted and before I know it I'm dead. This so far is the biggest sticking point to me. It makes the game feel less like an rpg/rythm game hybrid and more like a normal rythm game where on top of everything someone punches me every couple of seconds.Despite those complaints, I'm actually enjoying the game a lot. The soundtrack is varied and enjoyable and the battles can be super challenging (if a bit cheap sometimes, but that's RPGs for you). Give it a try."

The only complaint I have as the rhythm game goes is that I had random occasional stutters that usually cost me my combo. That's not a huge deal in this game, but it's extremly annoying.If you're buying it primarily as an RPG, don't. The RPG battle mechanics are here to spice up the tired ""falling gems"" rhythm game, and while they certainly succeed in that sense, they're meant to play second fiddle. As such, you don't need to think about them much at all, and they're not going to make the game worthwhile for you if the rhythm gameplay isn't enough on its own. The story is passably entertaining, but maybe a thousand words at most and not something you're going to remember. None of this is enough of a flaw to be remotely concerning if you're here for the rhythm game.The ""side quests"" offered just a few regular songs with the leaderboard set to track something other than score, like max combo or damage healed. They're not very entertaining, but the ~two dozen arena battles go a step further in also modifying environment and other mechanics, which is fun.On a last note, while the acting in the voice acting is well done, several characters clearly weren't recorded in a professional studio and their voices are distractingly low quality.

The players actively swaps between all party members and chooses which to control and what they are casting, which makes the RPG combat elements all in the players hands as well.I highly recommend this for fans of Rhythm Games & RPG games.

The soundtrack is more diverse, but that's probably the only advantage of Metronomicon (personally, I liked BtE soundtrack a lot more, but everyone has different tastes I guess).1) The gameplay is a lot less skill-based and a lot more random. If your enemy wants to do damage when you don't have enough HP, it will do damage. If it wants to stun you, it will (and this will affect your final score). There is nothing you can do to control the situation (except for boss attacks, that actually give you a way to prevent the damage, like you normally can in BtE), so you kind of have to guess if you should heal one more time or try to kill one more enemy to get one more kill for the challenge.2) Interface tries to annoy you any time it has an opportunity to do so. You just finished one enemy and want to see the element of the next one? Well, here is an enemy, but it will take a few moments for its health bar to appear, so unless you want to memorize all the ugly sprites and their corresponding elements, you have to guess blindly. Any reasons to not show you an important UI element? Nope, just game being annoying. Another example: game convinced you that Water skills are blue, Fire ones are red, and Thunder ones are yellow? Basic color coding, works for every skill. Nice. Ok, quick quiz: as your cast spells, your battlefield changes from blue into red into yellow. Does it mean that it changed from water into fire into thunder? Of course not, it means ""first, second, third skill slot"", duh. It would probably kill the devs to be consistent, or to use different colors for unrelated things.3) Progression system is so broken that it makes the scoreboard system completely pointless. Want to compete with your friend and compare scores? The same song on the same character level may become a lot easier or harder based on the order in which you first completed these songs in the campaign (and this is permanent), so if you picked some other order, you may never be able to beat someone else's record, no matter how hard you try (the difference in mob levels will stay forever, even when you'll reach the level cap). Why they decided to implement this system is beyond me. And BTW, devs don't care about their game anymore, and have no intention to fix that.4) Performance. It's hard to believe, but a game that looks like a simple 2D arcade manages to drop frames at random moments on a powerful modern PC. Oh, and 1-2 seconds-long hickups every time you fiddle with the menus will make you hate the UI even outside of the combat.If you are looking for a fun rhythm game, try Before the Echo instead."

Unfortunately, it feels more like plain ol' DDR.There doesn't seem to be any strategy to it as long as you keep hitting notes. I haven't figured out how to tell how much life the party has or what status effects they're under, but as long as I keep rotating through characters, things work out.I'd probably like it better if the UI were clearer, but as is, there's a better RPG/rhythm hybrid out there and this just makes me want to play that. :( I'll give this another go in the near future (maybe it gets better later), but for now, I just find it disappointing."
,Not Recommended,416790,32838886,Posted: 26 June,all,MrMeatballGuy,"it's not a bad game, but the rhythm game aspect is too easy even on hard.i play alot of StepMania on hard and insane using keyboard so depending on your skill level this may not be an issue for you at all.it has support for stepmania songs but unfortunetly if the songs are ""too hard"" it makes them easier which is lame.i think the problem is that i like fast rhythm games and the RPG elements in this one slows down the gameplay alot compared to games like Stepmania, osu!(all modes) and K-ShootMania.i cannot recommend the game because i did not enjoy it, however the artstyle is good and i think alot of people will enjoy it."
,Not Recommended,416790,35284032,Posted: 28 September,all,Fugitive Unknown,"There are sevearal significant problems with this game that really killed any enjoyment for me.1- No Story2- The Dance Animations aren't very good or varied. Its essentially seems like the same pose repeated, which is pretty bad considering the relative simplicity of the characters, and the fact that you spend most of the game watching the same ones.3- There doesn't seem to be much to decide or impact in terms of strategy in this game. There IS management in the fight and knowing what things to do, but there's very little you can impact in terms of chosing who you want to add. I was kind of hoping for shops, new classes and the like, but they don't appear anywhere I've seen.Functionally, the whole game feels like a very basic rythym game with a bunch of stats tossed on as a gatekeeper to content.Personally, I'd rather play a rythym game where the game feels more impactful and the animations are more vaired, like One Finger Death Punch."

There's not much more that can be said.The good: EverythingThe bad: This game has what I would like to call ""Shovel Knight syndrome"". The game is great, I would play it WAY more often IF it had better Mac support. This game plays in full screen and on Mac it won't allow you to F3 out. And if you try to  go windowed, the game crashes. If you quit the game, the Mac crashes. It's ♥♥♥♥ing annoying and prevents me from playing further. I love this game but I would love it more if it worked. I strongly recommend to any PC users. But I can't give this game a good rating untill they fix their♥♥♥♥♥♥"
