Not designed to be a full game. Its released on steam to support the final development of Spaceventure (With the money it generates).And finaly: As a Backer i already got a DRM Free Version of this Minigame for 2 weeks. And still i Bought this game on Steam! For the greater Glory of SPACEVENTURE :-)"

If you think someone was trying to pull a fast one here, you're a moron. You haven't noticed something that's escaped the notice of everyone else. You've noticed the most obvious thing in the entire collected history of obvious things.As parodies go... it's one of those parodies that's better than the original product. You know, the kind of parody that ALMOST NEVER HAPPENS. And I really like the games it's based on, don't get me wrong. The production values here are well in advance of even the last Freddy's game, as its developers can boast decades of combined experience in making awesome games. It's got indie soul plus triple-A quality.This game was made by the Two Guys from Andromeda, who made Sierra's famous sci-fi parody adventure game series Space Quest. It's in the same vein. In fact, it's been released to get a bit more funding for their new project, SpaceVenture, a spiritual successor. So buy this cheap-as-heck game, enjoy it, and know you're making an even better product possible. I grew up playing Space Quest, and I can't think of a better way to pay these guys back for the hours of fun and frustration they provided than helping them provide even more.Be assured, this is a full game in its own right. It's a bit longer than the games it parodies, in fact.This game has terrific visuals, excellent gameplay, and a great mixture of goofy and nerve-wracking moments.Seriously, play this game. FIve Nights at Freddy's is awesome. This is awesome plus decades of talent and a lot of Kickstarter money, and it'll pay for even more awesome later on. PLAY THIS GAME."

I like the Patrick Warburton styled voice acting and SCI FI setting.  best of all is the jump scares WILL scare you. :) and the EVIL mutant chickens are some of the most hilariously freaky creatures I have seen yet. Never thought the sound of clucking in the dark could be so fear inducing!Knowing that this is just a tiny part of a larger upcoming adventure game by two classic video game veterans makes it a valued part of my collection, their trade mark humor is felt a lot in the dialog and even the very premise is very in line with classic Crowe/Murphy humor.Thanks for the fun playable teaser you guys!  very happy to hear you are still making games! :)"

I went in expecting a FNaF clone, but what I got a rich, enjoyable parody full of chicken-humanoid humor set in a sci-fi world with mutant birds, robotic variations, and a twisted Colonel Sanders. A bit on the easy, even when claiming ""I'm not scared, Let's play!"" at the start. I was let down that the camera really did little in the line of aiding me to survive the seven nights (yes, it's not just a standard work week in this one), but the deeper you get, the more tense it all becomes as you unravel more through discussions and log entries."

That is up to you, as only YOU can save Henkind!...For $3 you really can't go wrong with this game, especially since it will help development of another, larger game from developers that were at the forefront of parody and satire in videogames back in the day. If you found this review funny, then Cluck Yegger deserves a place in your library, and SpaceVenture will be a game for you."

,Recommended,416800,28104338,"Posted: 30 November, 2016",all,CreepBat,this is one of the very few good fnaf fangames out there. It builds tension and release like a horro game should do. Although the jumpscare isn't animated and just moves around the screen alot it still scares you good. (btw you have to try tame mode believe me you'll laugh so hard when you get jumpscared ;) ) Anyways I do recommend this game great fnagame! :D

,Recommended,416800,25420438,"Posted: 8 September, 2016",all,GlitchBit Games,"This game is a parody DONE RIGHT...lemme explain. Cyieftpop (acronym for game) is a promotional game for another game called spaceventure or spaceguest (I FORGOT) you play as Cluck Yegger Free Ranger as he goes to the planet of the poltroid to stop Cernol Zanderz and his evil poltroid chicken factory called BFC Bodasious Fried Chicken, when your flying into the planets atmosphere you get shot with an ion storm and crash land right in front of BFC. The games story has Cluck repairing his ship durring the day and recharging the solar battery for his NIGHT TIME SURVIVAL. At night time you have to play Poltroid Peekaboo with your Robotics cussin's until day light (poltroids hate light remember that.) Clucks ship comes with two security doors to the right and left of him and in front is the main control pannel which allows him to check his ships cameras, scan for enemies in the factory, and activate a blast shield (for a big friend that hatches on night 3...i call him fluffy...cluck calls him BIG FRIGGEN CHICKEN) The repairs on Clucks ship takes 7 days exaclty so help the free ranger escape from the planet of the poltroid before he gets nibbled into gibblets by his feathered cyborg cussin's"

76561198076346059,Not Recommended,416800,18981187,"Posted: 9 November, 2015",all,E.C. Mann,"Escape From The Planet of The Poultroid, developed by Guys From Andromeda, is, to put it lightly, a Five Night’s at Freddy’s clone. Only this time, you’re not the night watchmen at a children’s pizzeria, but a Space Ranger by the name of Cluck Yegger. Crash landed on the industrial planet of his arch nemesis, Colonel Zanderz, Cluck must remain on the planet for seven days before his ship’s engines can reach full capacity. Each night, however, he must survive the constant threat of Zanderz’s mutated chicken monsters.As mentioned before, Escape From The Planet of The Poultroid is an FNAF clone. You’ll have a variety of security cameras to monitor, doors to open and close and lights to flicker on and off, all the while maintaining battery power… sound familiar? So, gameplay is pretty much identical between both titles.However, Escape From The Planet of The Poultroid is clearly aimed towards a younger audience. The scenery and monsters aren’t nearly as sinister as other horror titles and the game has a humorous tinge to it. Thing is… it’s not very funny. The voice actor behind Cluck is trying WAY too hard to be Patrick Warburton, who some of you may know as Joe from Family Guy, and his audio logs between nights may crack a smile outta your kid, if anything.The game’s managed to get me with a few jump scares, and I’ll give it credit for that, but there’s such a lack of dread to it. There’s no nail-biting tension or crazy build up, they just seem to happen without rhyme or reason.Gameplay is solid for the most part, but one thing is seriously hindering the experience: Almost every ten seconds or so, your monitors will be bombarded by static. This happens so often and so frequently, that I don’t have time to spot the monster before the screen goes white. It’s stupidly annoying. Apart from a minor mechanic where you can stun the monsters with high-powered lights, there’s nothing new to see here.As of this review’s posting, I’m only on night five, but I still plan on beating the game. Seeing as how they’re only asking for 3 bucks, feel free to give it a shot if you're a fan of FNAF or games like it. But don’t expect anything too special from Escape From The Planet of The Poultroid."

So I went to my friends house and played it there. It's pretty fun. My computer is Linux and from what i understand this is a common occurance with linux users. So if you are playing on linux don't buy it but if not go ahead spend all the money you want on it.
