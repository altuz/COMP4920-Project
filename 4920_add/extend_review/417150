,Not Recommended,417150,25851830,"Posted: 4 October, 2016",all,PJ,"Huuuuge disappointment! Cannot recommend at all!I was really looking forward for this game, I liked the soundtrack and the ""Sanitarium"" mojo. Sorry, but Pavilion fails in so many levels in comparisson with Sanitarium. My thoughts and feeling after finishing published content:so far the game ends in its half. Okay, it's in a description and I sort of missed it - my fault. Anyway, I really hate this publishing model, especially in narrative games.no mouse control! In a game where the player controls ONLY a cursor! Controlling via keyboard is like an attempt to shoot the moving target while riding a wild horse. I don't get dev's excuse about difficulties in mouse control implementation. In a last chapter I was so consumed by anger and cried loud with frustration, because of need of precise timing which is - again - pretty hard and dumb thanks controlling a cursor via the keyboard.it's buggy as hell! Missing textures, cursor can be moved out of the levels borders, in one level cursor get stucked in one place and the only option how to proceed is exiting the level (tried three times - always the same result). I paid for the finished product, not for the buggy beta!animations are really cheesy. I wasn't expecting something like Inside animations, but this remains me games 20 years old.just three puzzle mechanics - basically lights, bells and blocks (and trains, which are practically same as blocks) - puzzles become quickle repetitive and boring... some mechanics are just denoted and not used afterwards during gameplay (wolfs, falling and healing)...speaking of trains - it's just a detail, but as a trains fan I was really annoyed by ""train crossroads"" - sorry, but it's just a mechanical nonsense...no direct narrative - it may work in certain adventure games, but it doesn't work in case of Pavilion. It's just a strictly linear puzzle solver with few fragments of  storytelling... enviroment may be beautifull (also sort of corny), but it's repetitive and really doesn't push the story forwards.painfully linear - there's almost no exploration, no find/use mechanics, almost no path selecting, no nothing - just few simple logic mechanics, so that there's no reason call Pavilion ""adventure game"". Pavilion simply lacks complexity of a proper adventure game.Conclusion: nice looking pictures and pleasant soundtrack. The rest is very disappointing in many levels."

It's  enjoyable to look at the scenery and plot a course through the levels.Unfortunately, it does have several limitations. The core mechanic is moving a cursor to interactable objects. But the mouse can not be done to do this. The simple interaction means that the puzzles are on the easy side -- even the hard ones are more of a matter of precise timing or smart navigating instead of logical brain-twisters.  For the price, it's a very short game; I finished in just over 2 hours. The story is implicit rather than explicit -- but this means you're wandering around the ruins without a stong sense of who you are, why you are here, and what you want.Worse of all, just as you start piecing together what you think might be going on, Chapter 1 is over and now you wait (and likely pay) to experience Chapter 2."

Very surreal, I spent much of the time wondering what was going on. In a good way, I should add.A few comments...* No mouse support, which is weird at first since you're only controlling a cursor. I can see why though, since in some of the puzzles it'd be more difficult to use the mouse, but in  those cases perhaps using wasd or similar would have been a good complement.* There is no predefined steam controller button for bringing up the menu, you have to press ESC on the keyboard. Other than that, the game works fine with the steam controller.* The puzzle mechanics can be a bit slow. The speed is good for the atmosphere though, so I wouldn't actually want it to be faster.* This is a short game. Apparently I finished it in less than 3 hours.* The ending is somewhat underwhelming. Be aware that this is only part 1.* Some people have complained about bugs, but I didn't notice any, which is nice (running on Linux).* In some places, some of the stuff on screen was blurry, a bit like if you were taking a close up photo with a big aperture. Not sure if that was intentional or not, but I didn't like it.* You only need to understand the language for the menues, so if you're not good at any of the available languages then you shouldn't have much problems anyway (although you'll probably not understand this comment in that case... oh well...).Most of these points may seem kind of negative, but the negativity is actually pretty much just nitpicking. So, in conclusion, I liked the game and I'll probably buy both the DLC and the next chapter (when it's released)."

,Recommended,417150,25665750,"Posted: 24 September, 2016",all,Stalltt,"This game is stunningly gorgeous and the soundtrack gives some very potent native american/vision quest vibes.What it is lacking in gameplay it easily makes up for with atmosphere, but some of the bugs take away from that a little. They were all pretty harmless, but having the ladder climbing sound effect repeated until I found another ladder to climb had me convinced that the sewer level's music was a blunder, but once I touched another ladder, I was able to go back to enjoying the ambience.My biggest gripe is length, the game looks and sounds amazing but sadly only lasted around 2 and a half hours -- some of the scenes blew by way too fast. I feel like whoever spent all of that time crafting them would have been saddened to see it be a minor couple of second footnote in most people's playthroughs.All in all a great, although brief experience.https://youtu.be/Y0UOr3dzCAg"
,Recommended,417150,29228186,Posted: 13 January,all,The Beard With The Pyro,"I got over the moments when I couldn’t figure out a solution to a puzzle with considerable ease, as I allowed myself to sink into the meticulously made visuals and music of Pavillion. It may seem like I am completely overlooking the puzzling, the one gameplay element that should be the most important part of a videogame. That’s not the case, though. The puzzles are varied enough. Their complexity grows as the game progresses and, save for a few moments when the solutions bordered on the arcane, they are showcases of competence and understanding of pacing. However, as well done as they are, my attention glided primarily towards the music and the art style. The second part is due to come out this year, however, even now, I’d heartily recommend Pavilion to any gamer that loves puzzle games. More than that, I’d also recommend it to everyone else, for the overall experience of passing through a brilliantly designed world, while having a wonderful soundtrack as faithful companion.Full Review."

The puzzle mechanics are not too difficult to decipher, guiding the man along his journey through impressive, immersive surreal locales. The soundtrack and subtle character animation are nicely done, however it is obvious from a gameplay perspective it is an iOS game as well, with very miniscule gameplay. I got it on sale and like it, I don' t think 10$ is asking much for it. May want to look up gameplay if you're hesitant."

Like I was.The trailer videos didn't really tell me much about the mechanics, just shows how freaking awesome looking this game is.(Sometimes I wish I could choose ''Mixed'' instead of recommended or not)"

,Recommended,417150,26050771,"Posted: 15 October, 2016",all,mrtomreed,"I didn't know anything about this game. Just accidentally came across a screenshot and was totally hypnotized by it. Its visual style is amazing, mixing elements of different time periods in a post-modernistic, but beautiful and detailed way. Gameplay-wise it's a puzzle game, which is easy at first, but quite hard near the end. A bit too slow-pacing, maybe. It's a pity, the game is unfinished (just a ""Chapter 1""), but I still would recommend it."

,Recommended,417150,30661437,Posted: 21 March,all,edderiofer,"Before you think that I am recommending this game because I found no flaws with it whatsoever, I did. It overheated my computer after 24 minutes.Granted this is mainly a personal issue, stemming from the fact that my own computer's quite old and should probably be replaced soon.BUTI've played many 2D games (because that's apparently the bulk of what my computer can handle without dying), and this is perhaps the only one that's so far made my computer overheat. She Remembered Caterpillars, for instance, is another 2D game with detailed art with a comparable filesize (though obviously that's not everything), and it ran on my computer just fine. In short, I think the game hasn't been well-optimized, and because of it, I'm refunding the game. When I get a better computer, I'll definitely be interested in buying this again.However, from the 24 minutes that I played, it's a very fun game with pretty neat puzzles (though with slightly frustrating but still tolerable execution). You control a man-- Oh wait, you don't. You controlthe environment arounda man, primarily by ringing bells, which makes the man try to go to certain spots on the map, and by turning lights on and off, which makes the man try to avoid any turned-off lights. By cleverly blocking off some paths on the map and allowing others, you have to make the man run over switches to open doors, access cabinets (containing keys to be used on locked doors).Later levels add timing-based switches (which will only keep the door for a short time) and movable giant blocks (which will block off certain paths from the man).Verdict: Fairly good game (I think), but not optimized well enough for people with older computers to play it."

,Recommended,417150,31226645,Posted: 18 April,all,tearfromthered,"Pavillon is a very unique and stunning puzzle game both in the visual and the gameplay. You do not control the character, but can only interact with elements in the world to attract him toward a goal. There is a lot of content and new features coming up as you progress. I would say this is for all puzzle lovers but not the best games for casual and some early levels can be really tough.  You may have to look online for a solution from time to time as there is only one solution to each puzzle most of the time."
