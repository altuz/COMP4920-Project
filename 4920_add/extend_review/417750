,Recommended,417750,22703095,"Posted: 29 April, 2016",all,AestheticGamer,"Left Alone is a first-person psychological horror-puzzle game about a man named Joel who was left by his family while in a coma, and has found himself in a miserable life where his only real companions are two friends he made while he was at war (where he earned a medal of honor). He's an ex-soldier now, and with his only real friends returning from their overseas stay, the three of them agree to go camping and fishing to reunite, relax, and share stories. However, things go south when his two friends arrive there before him and get trapped in a nearby abandoned school...This game was much better than I anticipated it to be. To be honest it doesn't give the best first impression, and there's roughness about the title (some objects and models you can clip and walk right through being the biggest thing), but this game nails what it sets out to do.This game actually completely unnerved me. I wasn't expecting it to, I am a horror veteran who has played all eras of the genre, and I've gotten harder to scare over time. And it doesn't accomplish this with jump scares or cheap tactics, it has some excellent sound design and slowly builds up a really thick atmosphere and creepy antagonist. You read about the people before you, and small things happen as you explore. It got to the point where I started feeling incredibly paranoid, and I admit I got completely spooked for a good 10 minutes. Rare for me, and worth bringing up.Which also highlights the game's excellent sound design and slow burn elements. Sound brings a lot to horror, and they nailed it here. The music is appropriately spooky, as are the sounds, and most fit with the scenes so well I hardly noticed them, and yet they succeeded in unnerving me. Really helped the immersion factor, and knew when to go quiet too.And this is to be said; the game is a bit slow. It builds up its scenario, you spend some time exploring rooms. And the game has puzzles, some relatively challenging ones at that. There were a couple points I was stuck at a puzzle for 10-15 minutes before eventually solving it; none are really too hard once you figure them out, but many give you cryptic or little information you need to piece together to figure out the solution.With all of this comes a rather nice story, though I will admit while the ending wasn't bad I kind of wished they would of explored it more.There's not a whole lot more for me to say on the game. It's a fantastic psychological atmosphere piece with some great mood, cryptic puzzles, and builds itself up nicely. If that sounds up your alley, I'd recommend it."

You will quickly learn that nothing is a threat. Nothing is chasing you. The scares are sometimes clever and unique, but they really don't scare you. Sorry, but when I'm bored walking around, it's nearly impossible to scare me.-Invisible walls everywhere. How about just making a wall or something blocking instead of all these invisible walls.-Graphical glitches. This applies to the trees where white stuff is on the edge of the trees. Also when you turn on the flashlight, it lights up the trees without touching them.-It has a broken interaction system. You can search specific items, but it's so unclear what those items is. The only indicator you have that you can search an item is that your crosshair turns red and becomes a little bigger. The problem is that it doesn't seem to work half the time. Sometimes the crosshair likes to stay red for a short period so you don't know what you can interact with. When you have searched something all it does is play a sound and write some text in the bottom saying what you have found. There's no visual indicator to what you have searched so you end up searching the same item again and again. You also don't have any inventory-It's all about walking back and forth. Nearly all I did was walk through the same hallway, the same pathway, the same doors. The area is actually not that big.-Horrible draw distance.-Bad UI. Default Unity UI, really? Talking about a way to make your game look very unprofessional.-Its about two hours long. That is if you don't know anything. Alot of times the game decides to lock you in or keep you from moving or basically make you wait in the same room for two minutes until it decides that you can progress.I was greatly disappointed by Left Alone. I had hoped so much from this game. I didn't expect it to be so liniar. I didn't expect it to even cost anything.The big problem is that it's very boring. Its pretty and detailed, but the world feels so static. You can't really interact with it. As i said, most of what you do is backtracking and that becomes pretty tiresome after a while. It's not scary, because there's no threat. The story is forgettable.I was really expecting something much better than this. Now I'm really sad."

The game is a quick, 3 hr psychological thriller.  Perfect for a single night sitting.  The puzzles can be a little tricky, but not hard enough that a walkthrough needs to be consulted.  I love an opportunity to support indie developers, and this game did not let me down.  I played this with my girlfriend, and we were thoroughly spooked.  The only negative is that the ending is a little weak, but this is a common mallady within the horror genre.  Would recommend to my friends."

I personally didn't care, I just enjoyed playing through this and looking at this well-detailed school.You've got an eye for detail, and that's where this game shines the brightest I think. It's good and scary, but all of it is a little cliche (but after getting the save your friends ending I think that might be intentional)Your audio-work is good, and I can see most of the little tricks you use to get around limited abilities and they are very good little tricks. This is good on a technical and playable level in my opinion.All in all I'd say this is a solid game that should be experienced multiple times.8/10 ""No seriously it's behind you this time"""

The scary and amazing atmosphere is more or less entirely build on sound and music, respectively on light and darkness. Diversified levels, clever puzzles and visually the game had moments of being interesting and spooky; no monsters/enemies, no hide and seek... ;-) The only downside is the save game feature. It can take a long time until the game saves your progress. Besides that, worth every single $/€! What a gorgeous trip with a big WTF moment at the end…"

,Recommended,417750,22772717,"Posted: 2 May, 2016",all,The Cashman,"A fun, tense thriller with a few surprises.I was happy that this game told a linear story without the immediate threat of an enemy, like Slender and it's sequel, The Arrival. The puzzles are fun, not too difficult (I did have to look up the answer to one, but the rest were doable on my own without feeling too easy) and it builds a great atmosphere through well-done sounds and some mild (but very well done) jump scares, including a very fun one that I thought was especially clever.The game also had a few funny, self-aware moments that I appreciated.The story is actually quite engrossing, and the horrors that await you are a bit disturbing. Unfortunately, the ""twist"" ending (which I won't spoil outright, but stop here if you want to go in completely blind) was a bit disappointing and I thought it could have been done better. I actually was able to guess the ending before I finished, but I'm sure some might be surprised by it. However it does feel like a cheap, ""fake out"" that makes the adventure feel a bit ""useless"" if you will. In a way, it feels like an insult to the player who wanted answers to the story. Answers which it mostly provided, but it still feels cheap.Overall though, for the price this is one of the best horror experiences I've had the pleasure of playing. It's nothing ground-breaking or particularly unique, but it does everything mostly right and is a fun way to spend a late night. The story lasts about 2-3 hours.Great job to the devs, and I look forward to any new releases."

Including Alien Isolation for that matter. Of course it isn't fair to compare an indie title to a AAA company but I felt credit is due in that regard.Some of the puzzles are challenging at least if you are a spoon like me.With all things horror your milage my vary, but I'm certainly enjoying my playthrough so far.The only thing this game really is lacking is Ronnie Coleman. The most horrific thing to me was seeing the gym and no weights. Who knows maybe its Ronnie stalking the school and he has stolen all the weights. Or maybe its the vengeful spirit of Kai Greene out to get revenge on the Mr Olympia judges.At least I'm glad I don't have friends to go camping with.Seriously though it might be an indie game but if you can get over that you will have a good time."

When I was watching the trailer, I wasn't really sure about the whole idea of the puzzles, but I actually thought they added to the game. Although they were challenging (it took me over 20 mins to work out the first one!!)) they do work, and you get a feeling of accomplishment when completed.I really enjoyed this game overall, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good horror, as not only is it really unnerving yet enjoyable, it's absolutely great value for money!

But this game really caught my eye I have been awaiting for the release a fair while now, and I have to admit, it was most definitely worth the wait!I'm not one that scares easily to horror games, but I do say, this one got me on so many occasions. I thought I'd wait to play this when it got dark (as you do) and I started out with the volume on full blast, but slowly as the game went on, the volume level dropped a little as my nerves got the better of me (I couldn't hack it). This really was creeping me out and sending chills through my whole body, exactly what a modern horror game should do!From the minute I began, I noticed the visuals/graphics were crisp and extremely well detailed and this persisted throughout the playthrough. This was also followed by stunning sound effects and music which were clear and fit the tone of the game perfectly. There really isn't anything to fault regarding the sound and visual, bang on!I liked the element of riddles and puzzles in which I came across (even though I found some of them really challenging) and took me a while to get my head around. I was almost ready to give up when trying to figure out the sequence of the levers near the start until suddenly I figured it out and began slapping myself because I had been sat there for 20 minutes mashing the levers like an idiot. If you haven't played this game yet, don't give up on the levers, you will work it out!I have been reading some reviews before this, and I have seen some negative ones regarding the price and stating it should be free. But really, is anything free these days? It's £4.99, that isn't exactly bank breaking? Most people are happy to pay more than that for a drink/entry into a bar or club.Overall, I really did enjoy this game, you can tell the 2 developers behind this have put 110% in. It also did exactly what it was set out to do, scare the s*** out of me!

76561198083068272,Recommended,417750,22781825,"Posted: 3 May, 2016",all,TheBeak,"It took me a whopping 7+ hours to finish the ambient, psychological horror game Left Alone.  A few unfortunate glitches impeded my progress and made forward movement impossible until I figure out what the game might have been perceiving that I was doing wrong.  The game also glitched again towards the end leaving me to start the final section yet another time and said section is woefully poor on save point points.  Still, by the hair of its chinny chinny chin I recommend Left Alone for diehard Steam horror enthusiasts that are looking for something new to play and are following the wise advice of avoiding Kidnapped and other unplayable games.In Left Alone you play as ex-military man Joel who is on the way to meeting up with his old buddies (army) for a camping/fishing trip out in the middle of nowhere.  Things start peacefully enough as you gather wood and rocks to make a firepit, but once you pour on the oil and light the matches, suddenly things go terribly wrong.  You come to with the camp destroyed, lost in the middle of the woods and with no contact with your friends except for several text messages.  You have no choice but to set off into the woods and try to find your friends or even better yet, civilization.  That's the basic premise for Left Alone.You can run, jump, use a flashlight and carry inventory items as you begin exploring the forest.  Use the flashlight sparingly because unlike other games of this ilk it WILL run out of battery power pretty fast which makes running around in literal pitch black darkness a chore because you literally can't see pretty much anything unless a rare lightpost or electrical station is around.  You'll eventually come to abandon school which seems to be the root of all evil as you uncover documents, cellphones and other pieces of those who didn't make it home.The atmosphere is tense with the graphics getting the job done nicely.  You'll be frequently creeped out even if your mission involves the usual; find keys, unlock doors, open special doors with keycards, figure out which item goes where, power up dormant electronical systems, etc.  All of the task work is handled well enough and you always feel like something is breathing down your back.  SPOILER:  In some ways it was refreshing but in other ways it diminished intensity, but there are little threats in your path.  You can die in a few rare instances but they'll be at the hands of your environment rather than some vicious ugly wielding a pickaxe.  This take on tension will have you constantly jumping at the unknown at first but you'll soon become used to the fact that most of the scares are from your own imagination.  In this sense, Left Alone is like a good 50s horror flick where the unseen is just as scary as the seen.Atmospheric sounds with very minimal use of musical scores further the tension and the games controls are tight enough  to keep you in the fight.  Left Alone isn't without its problems though...You'll get stuck on your environments from time to time and alot of forwarding the action relies on triggering events that spark your stalker's interest (you are not alone after all).  Sometimes this progression of events can become broken, since Left Alone avoids hand-holding and you can complete your objectives in whatever order you happen upon them for the most part, as long as you have the right items or keys that is.  The game also froze completely towards the end when I was about to finish it, leaving me to start a rather lengthy running section over again for the umpteenth time as there is no save point that I can find beyond the final run.  These quirks and glitches do hurt the score a bit and showcase a fun game that could have seriously used more polish on the cutting room floor.  Still, I had fun with Left Alone, so here's my basic overview of what's good and bad about the game for those that don't feel like reading an entire review.Pros:-Eerie setting with terrific ambient sounds and graphics-Solid controls-No hand holding allows you to solve puzzles at your own pace-Creepy environments that only get creepier as you progress-50s type horror atmosphere focuses on what you can't see rather than what you can.-Interesting story.Cons:-Very few threats or actual dangers.-Choppy movement can get you stuck on pieces of the environment.-A handful of glitches takes you out of the immersion.-Scattered savepoints became especially problematic at the end.-Story could use better resolution.-An inventory system would be nice to see what you have and what you need.-A once and doner.  Once you finish it, there's not much reason to go back.Overall:  7.5/10Although Left Alone is not without its shortcomings, the dark atmosphere and engaging story will keep you hooked until the end.  Unfortunately, a series of glitches caused me to spend nearly 7 hours on a game I should have been able to beat in around 3 1/2 tops.  The game is fun to progress in and see what horrible twist the story will take next, what creepy area will pop up and whether or not you ever find your friends.  The ending is a bit unclear but thinking back on it I think I understand what happened.  Left Alone is a small gem in the horror genre, hugely imperfect, but plenty entertaining which is considered a noble fate for alot of horror movies, so why shouldn't it be with horror games as well?"

,Recommended,417750,22814314,"Posted: 5 May, 2016",all,CarlsLowGravity,"Left Alone is a great little psychological horror game that has you on the edge of you seat by cleverly using the environment and sounds to make you feel a little on edge as you play.As soon as you start the game up you almost get the feeling that this is going to be a slender man clone game, but that passes ten minutes into playing the game.The puzzles are good, and a couple of them can become a little confusing but once you solve them you feel like you have accomplished something good.The overall quality of the game is good and well made; with nice environments and detail this game is a bargain for the price and is defiantly not overpriced for the content you receive.It is a little short, maybe around two hours of gameplay if it’s your first time playing but its defiantly worth the price tag and is ideal if you’re looking for something to play for a couple of hours to pass the time.(**Spoilers**  -  More about the game  -  **Spoilers**)The game is almost split into two areas, the first being some woods and the second being a school building.The woods in the first part of the game could do with some improvements to the fog, as it only seems to be off path and kind of looks like a repeated tiled pattern of balls of smoke. Some blending would help here to make it look more realistic.A little bit more work on the detail would also help in wood area, apart from a few school busses and logs outlining the path there isn’t much else that stands out.The second part of the game takes place in a school building and to me this is where the game starts to get interesting as you try and find your friends.The school is filled with quite a few puzzles which I enjoyed solving, although one puzzle had me stumped in which I had to get a code for a door. The puzzle included computer screens with shapes on them which had something to do with the code and I could not for the life of me figure it out so had to watch how it was solved by watching a YouTube video. Maybe this puzzle was simple and I was too dumb to see the answer but I felt like this particular puzzle needed more hints to figure out what to do.The final part of the game you find yourself in a brightly lit corridor after taking a lift down too it. The corridor had many doors but only one of them opened.It was at this point I felt the ending was a little rushed as it did not take long in this area.I really hope the devs will do a little more with the final area, maybe even open a few more doors in this corridor to extend the story a little and maybe include a couple of final puzzles.ProsNice environmentNice detailRuns smoothRuns smoothConsFog needs improvement, looks like unrealistic balls of smoke floating (Looks tiled Needs blending)Mouse sensitivity a little high and no option to change it (DPI adjustable mouse did not really help either)Sometimes you have to wait in locked rooms to progress (Can become confusing to the player)"

Playtime it about three hours (so not what it states above, I had to play the first two hours offline)The long version: Yes the start might be a bit pale, the graphics might look quiet outdated, the sound-fx are far under the level of an Outlast or SOMA. But don't let yourself deceive by the first part of it, the game really starts in the school building.In the school building the graphics is good enough and at least rich on details, light and shadows are working great, the sound effects are effective even though simple. The building has a decent size, I felt a bit lost sometimes (which is totally intended, I think) but never needed long to find my way again. The game builds up tension in a great way, without using real jumpscares. The long hallways in combination with the meager light and the feeling that you are not alone make a wonderful creepy atmosphere.There are some puzzles, partially quiet tricky ones but I never had that much of a problem with any of them that I had the feeling it would hinder the game flow."

It gives you the graphic you want and the type of gameplay you expect in a indie horror game. It challenges you the entire time you're playing the game and the story is actually very good.  I haven't finished the game so far. But for the first 45 mins. Its pretty impressive. The puzzles are hard to figure out at times but that is the joy of it. Here is a gameplay of the game.

,Recommended,417750,22886978,"Posted: 9 May, 2016",all,Kourgette,"All right, let's start with the annoying stuff (hoping that the devs will see it and patch it up):- The save system sucks. It autosaves sometimes, but not often enough, so if you want to stop playing for the day, you will probably have to do all over again things you already did.- There's no inventory. Sometimes, you pick things up, but you don't have the time to realize what it is.- Also, I didn't find enough batteries for my flashlight, so I ended up setting the brightness on max.Now, the positive stuff:It's a really cool horror game that will probably mindf*ck you. Everything start when your friends disappear during a camp. You will try to find them during the whole game, but there's a killer on the loose and your paths cross. I wondered during the whole game if the guy you're playing was psychotic and was dissociating enough not to realize he was actually the killer. (It's not a spoil, just a theory I had.) The atmosphere is creepy and there will be some jumpscares but not that much, you won't see any scary monster, everything is suggested (which is so much better than actually seeing things in my opinion). There are some puzzles to solve that made me feel like tearing my hair out, but nothing too far-fetched.In short, really nice psychological horror game. Creepy atmosphere. Nice graphisms. You should definitively try it :)"

Obviously, I don't want to write any spoilers. It's just a flat out gripping story.

All the aspects of the game touch on a primal fear that leaves you on edge. There are jump scares, of course, but my point is that the game utilizes all elements in its genre. (Unlike a certain lame game known as staying 5 Nights somewhere. That game is crap and a perfect example of cheap lazy jump scares. To sum up: Left Alone is a masterpiece!

I enjoyed the first 5 minutes of the game. The story really made sense and liked the way the game built up to something. Later in the game we come across an old school with good detail and had a great spooky atmosphere. I enjoyed reading the notes and the writing. I also enjoyed the sounds in the game, thought they were very well made. Overall in the positives, Good game.Negatives-: (Detailed tips to make the game better)Just a few negatives, more of tips really than negatives. I found it difficault to run through the puzzles at times. If I didn't look on the internet about the switches, I would have found it difficault to do, if not impossible. I don't know how other people managed to do it but I just coulden't figure it out. Then we have no ""objectives"". Where the map was torn in half, at first it didn't occur to me that you needed to go back and do that. Maybe put something like ""Find out what to do with the torn map"" or something like this. The last thing was I thought the school was a little too large but really I don't mind too much.Overall, great game, atmosphere and nicely made animations.

Story held a lot of promise, and while the puzzles were simple, they were sometimes a little annoying. I mean EVERYTHING you find requires you to find something else before you use it. It felt like a crafting system. Found a gas mask? Too bad, buddy, you need a gas mask filter first! Found the generator? Well go find the gas! Know where the gas is? Well what are you gonna put it in, stupid? Go find a jerry can! Thank god I had enough beer to temper my patience.When the scares do start happening, they’re good.

Feeling so ripped from immersion by all this, I ended up writing a review about how unpolished I felt it was. I made no friends at the forums that day, or at the pub, being so depressed that even the bouncer had to stop for a drink. But the morning after, much to my surprise the devs actually added me on steam with requests for further feedback as if I hadn't trashed their game hard enough already.So thats exactly what I did. Hungover af, from dawn to dusk, non-stop bug testing and mapping out the flaws that bothered me the most. Talking back and forth with one of the two fine gentlemen who made this game sure made time fly fast. Why I did this I still don't know but if you turn back time, I'll do it again. After all this I found my self just blabbering away as we talked about gamedesign, life, the universe, and everything. Really nice fellow!10 days later their 1.1 update hit the shelf like a wrecking ball! Fixing almost everything I mentioned and more. These are devs that love their craft and it shows. All that said, if you're still uncertain about buying this game and plan on visiting the negative review section, then I recommend you grab all the reviews written before this update and render them obsolete."

Also random invisible walls in the middle of road kills the immersion easily.Edit 1: Ok, further down the school section the game gets better, including the visuals. The clues and puzzles still need more ""visual"" and story-related hints though. It can get a bit frustrating running back and forth. However, the mood gets a lot better in the school section. The audio could need some more work there but the tension and story gets better.Recommended only for these who have patience to solve obscure puzzle and for those who are tired of ""run away from the monster and hide"" type of horror games."
,Recommended,417750,26364344,"Posted: 1 November, 2016",all,WildCrd007,"Around Holloween I was looking for a horror game and I found this one. Tonight I completed the game and most of it was really enjoyable. By the time I made it to the end of the second level it held my interest enough that I didn't realize I had spent 2 hours of continuous play on it.Here are the things I enjoyed:At the start of the game you are made to feel relaxed and at ease. It changes quickly but this sets the mood to how scared you feel throughout the other parts of the game. The sounds that play while I'm navigating the different areas had me on edge and the scenery is good at keeping the mood consistantly erie. This was espeically true for the first level. The second and beyond remain creepy but it changes scenery so you won't get the same feeling throughout the game.Here are the things I didn't like:Like most horror games I had to search for solutions to make it to the next part of the level. The puzzles aren't hard but it can be very time consuming depending on your level of experience with similar games. The amount of time I spent on each level leads into my real issue. The save system will only auto save at the beginning of each level. There are no other options for saving. While I like this feature for this peticular game (and certain other horror games), it can be frustrating to spend an hour making my way through the level and have to quit before being able to get to the next auto save point. Another aspect I didn't like is there is no way to display the inventory I currently have so I can see the name of items that can point me in the next direction. If I pick up an item without reading it's description I will have no idea what I just got. The flashlight was another issue for me. In most games that I've played, the flashlight will move as you move. In this game there is a slight delay from when I move to when the flashlight focuses on what's in front of me. I think this is a bit more realistic and can add to the scares you get but because it's not what I'm use to it bugged me a bit. The last dissatisfaction I had was with the ending and the brief period leading up to it. The story was building towards something and when it came close to the end I felt it was being dragged on a little only to find a short while later that it was a big let down. I was left with a feeling of Why? What was it all for?Final review:Overall I would recommend this game to people looking for a decent story with a good build up that provides a creepy feeling throughout most of the game. Using headphones in a dark room will deffinitely keep that feeling alive and enhance it. The same ways you get scared start to get old about a little past half way through the game. While there are the issues I've mentioned above, as long as you are patient with the game and have about an hour or so for each level they shouldn't bother you with exception to the last part of the game. I also don't see much replay value in this beyond the first level. After having completed the game I think that $6.99 is a bit too high. I would suggest $5.00 as the best price. I was able to get a couple hours of enjoyment from it but I didn't like how it was put together at the end. It felt like it was missing something which left me feeling as if I wasn't done with the game but there was nothing left for me to do.That's my review. If you have any questions or want to discuss something send me a message or comment on this review."

The game's location once you head inside the school is really quite freaky and the whole backstory of the janitor was actually really creepy too. From the momentn I found the cabin I couldn't help but get chills up my spine.The game is a really nice length too for the price, took me around 2 hours to complete. This is a game that has an area where you walk around and start finding things that open other things that were locked in the area , which gives the game a nice sort of natural progression feeling, and it's 'puzzles' are quite clever too.However it does just have to be said, the ending sucks. Like really really sucks. Not even just the direction they took it in (which sucked too) but the abruptness really leaves you just like, ""Oh. Oh okay, it's over?

This game relies heavily on it's ambience to tell it's story, which can be a bit ambiguous at first. As you progress you can easy find yourself hemhawing around in a room only to have the living crap scared out of you when you turn and face an object that literally wasn't there three seconds ago. The puzzles are pretty deep and interesting, though a couple I found confusing, in one case I restarted the game thinking I had failed the puzzle because I couldn't open any doors... Only to find out that I needed to wait 2 minutes and the door would unlock.... That is one of two thing I could complain about regarding this game, which brings me to my next and last complaint is, that the save checkpoints are far and few between... so if you restart a game, or go to bed for the night, you might lose multiple steps completed into a puzzle. That said the game is good enough to keep your ( well at least mine ) attention long enough that you keep going :) All that said, I highly recommend this game if you like goosebumps, ambience and the occasional zOMFG!!!

The puzzles are achievable but not easy so although we didn't have to cheat we felt confused and baffled a few times before working something out - the best form of achievement. Very creepy and freaky, made us jump several times and have troubled sleep!

This game shirks decades of basic UI and gameplay development in its genre. Don't buy it.Left Alone utilizes what it considers to be a series of puzzles to block progression of an on-rails like linear ""horror"" experience. When I say puzzles what I mean to say is ""Find this keycode, find another keycode, pull these switches in order - repeat.""The horror experience could be much better. With no fear of death or detriment of any kind the player is left nothing to do but blindly progress, knowing nothing will affect their gameplay negatively. The horror elements, such as audio, are severly misused. The audio itself is never properly positioned, so those looking to ""chase"" sounds will find nothing ever there except invisible walls. On one occasion a noise is heard from the other side of a bathroom stall, with the player unable to open the stall. When the curious player attempts to jump/climb the stall, you find it's entirely empty despite the noise, much as there is never anything where noises are coming from. Sometimes the ""scary"" noises are even directly positioned as coming from your head or feet if you're using surround sound, making it impossible to believe that something somewhere in the game is making a noise and worth being fearful of. The environments are fine (if non-interactable), but utilized so poorly as to ruin any sense of immersion necessary to actually scare ones self.The ending is... horrid. Unresolving. It's just the end. You might as well just quit at any point in the game, as you'll experience approximately the same level of resolution. Or you could skip all that and just not buy it.My message to the developers would be: This is a great demo, you could take it to E3! Have you ever considered making a game out of it?If this game was free or part of a humble bundle more would be excusable, but as an actual game it simply doesn't pass muster."

At one point they even add the ""Psycho""-esque violin, as if it's building up to some kind of event; but then fades out and you just carry on with absolutely nothing happening and it was completely pointless.There is no sense of urgency, as everything is 100% scripted (so no replay value).

A tiny bit cliche also. The intro is just a wall of text; I wish it could have been voiced, or at least played out like the moving text after the control screen that follows the introduction.There is a small typo in the word ""none,"" it reads: ""Non"" in the game (after the control screen).Mouse sensitivity is off the charts TOO FAST. I have it on the lowest default setting, and the movement is widly fast. I can not force myself to play like this (hence the quick in-progress initial review). Also, itseems as if the mouse slider doesn't save? Just for fun, I wanted to see what it would be like to RAISE it, started a new game, and just as before ... it was way too fast. I quit, checked options, and the slider was reset to default.The graphics (the few minutes I could stomache the crazy fast mouse movement) are VERY nice (especially for a game that only costs $7.00). Sound is also good.However ...What is the point of giving us generic graphics options like low, medium, high? Without letting us change individual things like bloom, HDR, AO, and AA? When playing the game, pausing and checking graphics options (in-game as I mentioned), there seems to be words like ""Pixel count: 7, AA: 0"" etc etc .. but no option to change that ourselves. And seems to be like AA is automatically turned off with no option to turn it on ourselves.Still, for $7:00 (the cost of a mcdonalds meal pretty much) and if you feel like changing the DPI (not a big deal at all, but we shouldnt have to do this) of your mouse yourselves, I would recommend the game if you're just a graphics and sound fiend.Hopefully these few nitpicks are fixed, and I can attempt to continue the game : ) Will update review if possible when I can~"

Everything about the game is poorly integrated into the environment: invisible walls everywhere, a rabbit with an awful animation that clips through rocks as it runs across the path, a ""you are here"" map with the password to a power plant written on it (really? the park management keeps the code to the power plant printed on their park map?)I stopped at a ""pull these levers in order"" puzzle which ended up in a bad unrecoverable state because of the♥♥♥♥♥♥poor programming.

It takes a bit to get into it, since the beginning is a giant back-and-forth-race trying to figure what the heck to do, once you are past that, it's pretty linear. Just don't die.So, is it worth 7$ to have some cool atmosphere after 1 hour of trying to figure out where to go, finally finding it, dying and doing it all over again? I don't think so, there's enough free games that offer that too."

It starts off wonderful, by giving you direction into what you are supposed to do, but immediately after the introduction it drops you into a world with NO context as to how you are supposed to go about tackling the various road blocks.I say road blocks because that is exactly what they are. They aren't puzzles. A puzzle is something that you have all the information to, and only have yourself to blame for not being able to figure it out. This games idea of a puzzle is saying ""do this thing"" and givng you NO context as to where the information to solve it is, leaving you wandering around for god knows how long to try and GUESS your way to victory.20 minutes in I wasn't scared of anything, I was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off. There are invisible walls everywhere, which breaks immersion, and the clarvoyance of the game is so horrendously bad, that you would be better off trying to find a needle in a haystack at night, with a laserpointer as your only source of light. This ""game"" is literally the epitome of a bad time. Don't bother with this trash."
,Recommended,417750,24095192,"Posted: 4 July, 2016",all,Harvester of Sorrow,"So Left Alone.. It was good, but it wasn't great.  There were certain things that were executed very well; i.e. the atmosphere, sound design, lighting, and the story.  The whole setting, which was an abandoned school, felt very real and believable, and along with it's lighting definitely created a spooky atmosphere... But that's just it, the game was only spooky.  For some people that's great, but there were no jump scares at all.The game ""trys"" to do jump scares via painting easels that well suddenly appear the moment you turn around.  At first they're creepy, they do give you goosebumps, but they quickly lose their touch and even become something to be laughed at.  Honestly, this is something we've seen before in other games and for Left Alone to rely solely on this tatic left an empty void for horror. Sure for most of the game I was on the edge, listening carefully for any and all sounds, but since nothing was actually happening, eventually, my guard came down and I realized there was nothing to fear.My other set back for the game were these long dragged on moments that became irritating.  An example would be that you're locked in a room and you have to wait, what feels like several minutes, for the door to unlock.  This happened a couple times in different ways; there would be the scare tatic, the effects would quickly come and go, then you're left sitting there waiting for the game to allow you to progress.Now why I am rating this a thumbs up? Because I really feel like this game has a lot of potential.  It definitely needs some work, but there is genuinely something here, quite possibly a great horror experience.  It is it's own execution that I feel needs to be tweaked and flushed out just a BIT more.  With an intriguing story, awesome settings and lighting, and great sound design give a lot of promise to Left Alone, I just like a lot more scares personally with my horror games."

No fov, the mouse sensitivity can only be changed at the main menu. Prompts in game are not reflective of key changes made.- puzzles, if you can call them that mostly rely on you walking around often just clicking e (the use button) waiting for something to happen.- the above directly combines with triggers often taking a long time to occur, meaning you just are walking around aimlessly. These last two points are the reall issue with the game, an unsetttling atmosphere becomes mundane/boring if you make someone walk around the same environment for an extended period of time with nothing really changing up as you search for what will push the game foward.- you get stuck in the same envornments walking back and forth over and over.... and over again.- the story, in particular the ending is a disaster. Trully horrible, unengaging and makes what happened seem pointless (though i'm told there are multiple endings based on a fairly obvious choise, so maybe the other ending(s) is/are better.- very little content, the game is simply short and if you knew where to go could easily walk through it in 20ish minutes I imagine. The rest of the twoish hours it will take to finish is spent walking back and forth in the same environments as said above waiting for triggers to occur or to find the next thing you need.In summary: Left Alone is a cheap game seemingly made by two people that at first intrigued me but ultimately feels to vague to the point my patience was being worn down. It has some moments and with some more compelling and interesting puzzles and more time to perculate we could have had something great.As it is it may be worth picking up on a sale even at its already low price for those looking for a horror game. So this isn't entirelya  don't purchase it, but more of a wait untill it's even cheaper as there is a very strong chance it won't be for you. It has potential, but sadly much of it is missed."

WHere to begin, thsi game overall if doing a speed run can basically be completed in less than 1 hour. There is no inventory only what you immediately have stored to be used at it's POO, or Point Of Origin. But POO sounded apropriate. The childlike developer cleverly set up what is commonly known as ""SAVE POINTS"" which is a sad, so so very sad attempt to make it seem like this game is longer. It's what unskilled developers to in order to create a ""cash cow"" source of income. (eg: You paying for this Poo) There is very little to none interactions with the ""So-Called-Buddy"" that texted you to begin with to even get you to come out to the camps location that quickly turns into a boarding School. Funny how that worked. What I say by Funny is what I mean by Sad or disappointing. Pricing: No , the $6.99 is if at all based on the TRUTH I just said is definately not worth it. That said, the positive aspects of this game are as follows:Environment:It has a nice look to it that clearly has potential if expanded on.Ambience:Sound and lighting are ok and has a good chance at scaring you. The potential of truly making your hair stand up on the back of your neck is there, albeit if the developer seeked out professional assistance to give this game an AWESOME or should I say GRUESOME and certainly advance Update.Visual/Art:Yes there is some nice art in this game and to be honest is was almost as if the developer intended it to go to waste. You'll find nice drawing or paintings on the ground occasionally and really need to look as if ""easter egg hunting""Map:This one is tuff as I wanted to keep it seperate from the Environment section. The overall map is very, very good considering if this game was an ""Early Access"" game leaving what I would consider 75 % more room to add on to the story as in how you arrived, and why a secluded camp ground in the middle of no where is so very close to a Boarding School. For one in real life due to pedo's perverts and junkies this would have no basis in reality and would quickly be fenced off. However the potential is there expanding on that, the lake for fishing and a few cabins which can be not related to the Boarding School would make it great.Final Thoughts:Once and if at all the original developer decides to follow up and expand on this game it has the potential of a $20.00 game. This game should be considered an early access and at best a ""DEMO"" of the real game and if any more experience developers are seeing this you may consider approaching the original developer for rights on expanding, adding in fun factors, scare potential, and Achievements to corrospond to each stage of events. As once you play you may off hand notice as small as this game is, I would have liked an Achievement for at least 5 events that took place. True controller for full control support is very simple and easy so those with Xbox 360 to PC can enjoy this game using Big Screen HDTV Steam options, spooky and eerie music and sound should be up'd a knotch and most certainly save on the fly feature is an absolute.Buyer Beware.http://steamcommunity.com/app/417750/discussions/0/357285398700444840/"

You can improve writting a good story and not the so common and threshed story of your game.I mean that resource of giving a plot twist when you don't have a good story.. it is like the archetype of playing a horror game and then all of it was a dream... cliche.I bought this game recently. And I finished it in 3 hours. I do not worry about the lenght of the game, really. I was happy with the game and mechanics.Love the puzzle in the high school where each geometric shape corresponds to a number..Love the game in general. Really.But the story.. so inmerse at the beginning.. and suddenly at the end I opened a door and all changes in a minute.It's like eating a chocolate cake and then you realize that the filling is pure s-h-i-t.I do not want to be rude saying your game is a s-h-i-t.. no.
