,Recommended,417860,30088864,Posted: 21 February,all,PapaDelta138,"Notice: This review is based on my personal experience, which is very similar to the story of the game. Call it a semi-spoiler. With that said, those with intentions of playing the game without being spoiled, please look elsewhere.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I used to have a lot of friends back in high school. And there was this one person with whom I never spoke too much. After graduation, she left for the US. We were able to get in contact with each other through social media, though. I think I struck a conversation with her first, and that's when our friendship started to blossom.A few days in, we start to talk about almost everything, being all nice to each other and stuff. We speak about what school was like. Just sharing memories.A few weeks in, mid-2012, and we talk to each other non-stop. We tend to stay up late for each other. Sometimes, we'd ask each other stupid questions just to keep the conversation going, because it was fun.A few months in, end of 2012 to early 2013, and we have practically found solace in each other, and talk to get away from things. We share info on our problems. We complain to each other. We debate on things. And there are many times when she felt like she wanted to come back here to meet everyone again. This was the closest I've been with a person online.It's about mid-2014, and we've run out of things to talk about. She talks about how she doesn't feel too alone anymore. and how she's making new friends now and then. And I say that I'm really happy for her. She sells cupcakes, and goes out with her friends once a while.It's 2015 ... I send her a sort of petition to sign, but it was just a desperate attempt to try to resuscitate our excessively engaging conversations again. It didn't work, ended up talking about college again. It felt like talking to her the first time all over again.2017... and counting ... I haven't spoken to her since then ... and it doesn't feel like we're friends anymore.Although I am a stranger to the nostalgic visualization that the game represents to those who are familiar withAOL Instant Messaging(as I have clearly never used it),Emily is Awaynails this emotional aspect of my life so hard, it made me think of the times when I actually had a lot of fun talking to my friend. The fact that I can't have that back again makes it all the more hurtful. And all the more reason to give it a try, so you could appreciate what you had while it lasted.This game, in short, is a reminder that all good things will always come to an end. And I feel ♥♥♥♥ing horrible about it."

,Recommended,417860,29970054,Posted: 16 February,all,Chimz,"The game is about you having a crush on a girl from your high school and chatting with her.The game puts you in 3 years of the character's life where he chats with his crush Emily.It's kind of fun. You say something, then she replies, then you have to reply and it goes on.Each time you have to reply, you will have three choices of what to say. So you have a few options and it won't be like watching a premade tv show.Picking what to say is not all you have to do. You have to type it too. Well, not quite by yourself. There is a premade sentence for each choice. When you start hitting your keyboard buttons and try to type something, the letters began to be placed one by one. So you can either try to guess what your reply choice will say and try to type that, or simply just spam one button until the sentence is complete. Whichever type you are.It's kinda fun but also saddening and stuff. Just like a real crush. If you don't want to go through the pain of having a crush on someone, don't play this. If you do want to, then play it. It only took me 0.9 hours to finish it (I started button spamming in the second half of the game). 0.9 hours isn't very much so you won't lose anything. Specially since it's free to play.If you're a guy, you can play this. If you're a girl, I don't see the point. If you're a lesbian girl, yeah play and have fun.If you're a shemale, well then I'll be confused to advise whether to play or not so it's up to you. Heheh, just kidding.I'd give the game 7/10 I think. Made me relive some bad memories of when I had a crush on a girl and f**k did that hurt!WARNING: SPOILER ahead. If you want to play the game, STOP READING NOW!!! If no, you're not interested, then scroll down and read the spoiler. I only recommend reading it to those who finished the game once or don't want to play it and just want to know a fact about the game.----------------SPOILER--------------------SPOILER--------------------SPOILER--------------------SPOILER----------------No matter what choices you make, how you behave and what personality you will have, you will end up with one ending. Letting go of Emily cause she's a b***h! So don't worry about having picked the wrong answers, this would have happened anyway. I tried it myself.----------------SPOILER--------------------SPOILER--------------------SPOILER--------------------SPOILER----------------"

,Recommended,417860,21956712,"Posted: 20 March, 2016",all,HOTSHOT,"Indeed I played Emily is Away with reasonable hype after the great reviews I read on the steam store.The story of Emily fails in some crucial points I cannot honestly appreciate at all.Due to the nature of the game, I won't present a TL;DR section.Here we go:Much like Fallout 4/Mass Effect, you'll be presented 3-4 dialogue options that BARELY affect the overall story arch.Is that bad? Nope, as Emily does one thing very well: Making you want to experience every dialogue option to see the answers and different small talks you'll get in response.It does fail as a story as it has a start and (an EXCELLENT) build up.... but SEVERELY lacks as an end. It just... ends. Yes, it's impressive how you get to CARE about characters that don't exist and most: do not even talk (game's just a chat window, literally).But none of it goes ♥♥♥♥ing anywhere!Apparently there are 2 endings: Mine wasEmily ends up going back to the boyfriend she broke up with 2 chapters or so ago. A boyfriend that had one hell of a temper and didn't hit her because her guardian angel was amazing! Both you and Emily end up talking occasionally after high school as the story happens during college andthe tension between you and Emily is not only ridiculously cliché but the fact that by the end it's CRIMINALLY linear completely kills the atmosphere of a tense story I was so excited for. Until the last chapter I was loving the game, and then...♥♥♥♥♥♥starts getting talked about and I pick an option, as my character DELETES MY DIALOGUE and WRITES A NEW, LAME AND 1-WORDED DIALOGUE like ""Goodbye"", ""I dunno"".The chance of a real ""relationship"" with this virtual character/setting the mood for a great emotional story is completely skull ♥♥♥♥ed by this as every choice I make is quickly deleted and replaced with something that is answered for the sake of the ending being ""always bad"". All stories can end well.Not this one!Any questions of the story, just ask me, but overall I thought the ending (while realistic (then again, other realistic endings could've happened)) was rushed and literally went nowhere. Just a story of amissed chance at love that generated a weird relation between 2 friends of the opposite sex that ended their friendship by the end of collegeAnd as I do not see my choices mattering at all to the course of the story, I cannot even care for the second ending as I also don't see it being any conclusive.Other Stuff and Overall~A good game? Yes. Totally worth a playthrough and an achievement run as I got it 100% in like 40 minutes. The game itself can be completed in 25-30 minutes. It's charming, interesting and quite well done.It just lacks more branching paths that would allow for a good ending that cannot happen because sometimes your choices are replaced by others totally different (Didn't people complain about that in Fallout 4? This did even worse and get's nearly praised its♥♥♥♥♥off!), ending in a forced note that left a very sour taste in my mouththat I had to wash with proper dialogue options in an RPG.It's a free-to-play 60 Mb game. Definately worth a run. I sincerely hope for a sequel or a similar game but that allows for your choices to matter instead of this.A rock solid 7/10. Hit the sweet spot on everything but the ending which killed the experience for me."

No but actually I did really enjoy this game it's good for like a 30 minute to 1 hour time waster and is a cool and pretty interesting story (Even though it's a tad generic). My only draw back for the game was that sadly their wasn't another ending. I defifnitely recommend it, especially if you want a cool nostalgic experience or just a a time waster for an hour. And it's also free to play, so I would defitely try it out."
,Not Recommended,417860,29890222,Posted: 12 February,all,evieiscool,"this was a nice trip down memory lane of living through the early 2000s when everyone was on AIM and myspace. simpler days when away messages were an outlet of creativity and emotion. as a game though, it's not much fun. i played twice thinking the outcome would change with different responses; it doesn't. the entire premise of the game is just instant messaging. there's a reason this game is free to play, i wouldn't have paid even $1 for this. you're not missing out on anything if you don't play this and honestly i feel like i wasted an hour of my life. not entirely sure how this game won any awards/received any praise."

,Recommended,417860,29867079,Posted: 12 February,all,Torn,"The story wasn't very well done, andIt always ends the same poor way. It's a incredibly short ""story"" that leaves you with an empty feeling at the end, and when I say empty I mean more like pointless.However it took me on quite a nostalgia trip. If you used to chat with your buddies using AOL instant messanger on Windows XP like I did years back than you should give it a shot. it's pretty unique how well it made it feel like the early 2000s. The whole game is played on a simulated computer using an AOL instant messanger clone to talk to your friend, it even has the drama and stupid ""situations""that being a teenager comes with. Felt pretty close to how I remember it feeling like back when.It has value in my eyes despite it being a faliure. If you're around my age than I reccomend putting giving it a quick playthrough (20-30min), jumping a couple years in the past for 30min itsn't so bad. Hell,  If it was any longer I would be pulling my hair out."

,Recommended,417860,29798716,Posted: 9 February,all,Capt. Dexter Grif,"Throughout the course of the game the player is given the option of changing his/her avatars in tandem with whatever was popular at the time. Their friends also show progression by choosing new icons, biographies, and away messages.In the protagonists' senior year of high school in 2002, they use a chat client to talk with ""emilyluv"", ""emerly"", or Emily. They discuss high school and a fellow student, Brad, who keeps sending Emily messages. They also talk about a party that a classmate Travis is throwing that evening, which they may or may not go to, depending on player choices. Then they say goodbye as Emily logs off.In their first year of college (2003), the player talks to Emily again, who has gotten together with Brad or Travis (depending on if the player chose to go to the party or not), though she hints that the relationship has become rocky. The character congratulates her, and shifts to other questions, such as their classes. They say goodbye, as Emily yet again logs off.In their second year of college (2004), the player learns that Emily has broken up with Brad/Travis, explained by Emily as ""growing apart"", and the character is given the option of consoling her. At this point, Emily either asks why they didn't come to Travis's party in 2002 or why they didn't kiss her if they did attend, depending on the player choices. They both wonder what could have been, and Emily immediately asks if she can come to visit. Most of the time, they will agree for Emily to come, and the player will subsequently cancel their plans with Emma, a friend of the player. The player, alternatively can choose to not allow Emily to come. Emily signs off.In their third year of college (2005), the player again talks to Emily, who wants to talk things over about her previous visit. If the character doesn't set boundaries and Emily visits, it turns out that Emily and the character ended up hooking up, and Emily feels like she was taken advantage of when she was vulnerable. If the character does set boundaries and they don't hook up, Emily asks if the character had feelings for her when she visited and why they didn't make a move. Alternatively, if you choose to not let Emily visit, she will ask you about your new friends. The conversation is awkward and distant, with Emily eventually leaving due to her discomfort, feeling too weird to continue.In their final year of college (2006), Emily and the character have clearly grown apart. Emily comments how her life is better now; she started dating Brad/Travis again and is involved in other things. The player themselves have lost their friend Emma, in some cases because of Emily. As the conversation comes to an uncomfortable and cold finish, the character begins to revise sentences asking if the two will ever be the same - deleting earnest questions and asking about the weather or other mundane affairs instead. Despite the protagonist's obvious feelings for Emily, she obviously no longer cares, and as a result, they say goodbye. For the first time, the player character is the one who leaves the conversation, logging off."

Chatting on a messenger client to a girl you’ve known since High-school through college/university (depending on your side of the Atlantic) and seeing the relationship develop……..or not. On paper this wouldn’t have grabbed my attention but so glad I read a good magazine review that lead me to it.One quick play-through and it really resonated with me. I loved the presentation including the background sound of the ‘PC’ running; thought for a minute my drives were getting noisy. A rare game, to evoke such a realistic retro feel in terms of my life and as a ‘game’.Be warned, if you’re not a bit soppy and romantic this may not be your thing.

,Recommended,417860,29634398,Posted: 1 February,all,Dissonance,"It's a kind of engaging story, though the simple mobile game ""Seen"" for Android basically did it better, while retaining the same approach.Obviously, a game for free is a game for free - you cant expect tons of content. And ""Emily is Away"" doesn't offer you that ton of content. With its multiple branches and endings, it certainly has replay value, and can keep you playing for an hour or two, but it lacks inmeaningfulchoices. After several playthroughs with vastly different choices, the actual story always stays linear and on the same track, no matter how hard you try to derail it by being destructive or nice to the deuteragonist Emily. The visuals are simple but nice, the sounds and ambience are very intriguing and a superb throwback to the earlier times of computers and the internet. The given options in a simple text adventure to imply actual emotion (like bits of text being deleted and rewritten by your protagonist, while youre typic the message) are used well.All in all, I do recommend it. Its a nice little creative indie game. And with it being free, and taking up barely any disk space at all, its definitely worthy of being in your library."
,Recommended,417860,29634892,Posted: 1 February,all,the von Essence,"Emily is Away is a wildly simplistic game; you chose a screen name and a profile picture, then go chat up your best friend Emily on an old-school Windows OS. The whole thing takes about thirty minutes to play through in entirety, but holds a surprising amount of emotion, combining the nostalgia of the game's format with the all-too-familiar nostalgia of remembering how things used to be before complications (like college) got in the way. After the 28 minutes I spent playing the game for the first time, I felt much more emotionally invested in Emily and her relationship with my character than I expected when I started, so much so that I teared up a little at the end. I'm about to go dive right back in for my second playthrough - the decisions offered in-game feel varied and important enough to make replayability high with this one.TL;DR: It's free, short, packs a surprising and familiar emotional punch, and will make you remember the good ol' days before Windows XP."

I can relate a lot to this game and just playing this game made a lot of fond memories come back. This game is very cool and if you are a kid that was born in the early 90s or late 80s I think you will love this game. This game goes over how relationships and conversations worked in the days of AIM. This game is very simple, but yet kind of complex because the decisions you make throughout can affect how the game plays out. I would recommend this game to anyone!"
,Recommended,417860,29630635,Posted: 1 February,all,Wysch,"Damn it. This game brings back memories of early 2000's when we ICQed and QIPed for hours. (Sorry, European boi here.) It also brings back memories of that one specific relationship probably every guy's had to have in his life. And God damn did this game make me love Emily, hate her afterwards and finally hate myself when I said the final goodbye.Anyhoo, this game although having such a simplistic design, is surprisingly strong in narration and its endings (no matter which you end up having... Kappa). I spent one hour at this F2P game, yet it made me relive my early 20's and for that I'm happy to to recommend this game to anyone who's 25+ yrs old. (Although in the end it made me realize how old I am. Thanks for that, Kyle, I'll be sure to play the second Emily game.)"
