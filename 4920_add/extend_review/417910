,Not Recommended,417910,28462970,"Posted: 18 December, 2016",all,100k,"So, this project started out as a 3D version of the successful game ""Hooligansgame"" made by a Polish company in Łódź, who were also known to release ""Ultras Online"" back in the day. The developers of THIS game wanted to piggyback off their success but became a sad attempt after all, starting out under the name of ""Hooligan fighters"", later ""Hooligan Warriors"" naturally the people expected the developers to add actual club insignia and perhaps an overworld. When the developers realized it was too much work, they gave up on the concept, made it a generic fighting game and renamed it ""Street Warriors online"", which already in itself tells you how much they care about their fanbased compared to how much they only care about a quick buck.While they did put some effort in motion tracking to make the fighting moves realistic and while the maps are beautifully designed I really, really urge you not to play this game due to the developer's crappy mentality that only goes after money, unwilling to listen to any feedback the users give them. Believe me, I gave them a shot, I tried to make them listen but to no avail. The fighting in itself is really generic, stale and requires no skills at all. And instead of doing something about it, the developers, yet again, fail to listen to constructive criticism and instead make a salty post on Facebook simply calling everyone a hater and begging people for thumbs up."

,Recommended,417910,29462308,Posted: 24 January,all,Bateman,"'dead game dont download waste of time' -The matchmaking issue won't be resolved if you won't bother to spend a minute a day looking for a match. You complain about lack of players yet you leave the game? Sigh.Anyhow, it's not a good game whatsoever. But that doesn't matter. It's fun. It's absolutely brilliant. The character creator is simple but it works.It's not gonna get you 400 hours of gameplay, but it will give you a more concentrated amount of fun.It's not pay to win, but the drinks are just in a strange place right now. They're being worked on, so I don't really mind, just don't use them. Small power ups that you can get for some ingame currency *Pretty cheap but will drain you over time* or for gold *Help the devs and you'll get some for free or buy it with real money*The only issue I have with it is the 8v8 matchmaking when there's simply not enough players, and even if there are it usually turns into a 2v1 fest with the occasional 'everyone-hits-one-guy'. Just focus on 2v2 and 4v4 for now, devs. And make all real money purchases cosmetic, pay to win aspects will only drive players away."
