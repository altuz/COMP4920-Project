THat's fine if the game is upgraded at all but it doesn't even take up the whole screen.  Instead it's a little window in the center as if the game is supposed to be made for an iphone 5 held vertically- which it clearly was.  The screenshots don't make this clear by the way.

Player input consists only of choosing which direction to move the red cube in an effort to guide it to the exit (or is it the entrance?). Once a direction is chosen, the cube moves until it reaches a junction, where it waits for your next instruction. There is no camera movement, because the fixed perspective is essential to the puzzle.The early levels are simplified to get you accustomed to the rules. Later levels are more complex, but not necessarily moredifficult. The only real downside with this kind of game is that since movement is necessarily limited to six possible directions, it becomes more of a 3D maze than a puzzle as many would think of it (I am totally fine with this, though). There are a few sections (especially in late levels) wherein many joints have only 2 available directions, and you spend more time moving/waiting than thinking/deciding. Most levels have more than one path to the exit, though the last few steps are usually fairly specific.The splash screen states that the use of an analog gamepad is recommended, but I had a much easier time controlling the game by clicking with my mouse.I've seen a few people get bent out of shape over the price difference between this version and the mobile version. Here are some solutions:Buy it through your mobile device's app storeBuy it through Steam when it is on saleShut upI've also seen a few complaints about how the actual game takes place in portrait mode (common practice for games that start out as mobile) with wide border sections on the left and right. This is evident to anybody who either watched the video or looked at the screenshots. In the actual game, the ""empty"" space is taken up by a slightly blurred version of the preceding and subsequent puzzles. This fact has no impact on the gameplay, and I think that using raw screenshots would have confused shoppers, as there would appear to be three puzzles on screen at once. Personally, I would have preferred solid white space on the sides, both for added focus on the puzzle at hand, and to fit in with the minimalist/tranquil aesthetic.Additional levels will be added (at least 10 have been announced so far), and I assume they'll be around the same difficulty as the existing late-game levels.It's a short, inexpensive puzzle, and I enjoyed it.₦ out of 10"

It's obviously a port from mobile, but oh well, it's playable.The influence from Monument Valley is obvious, but it manages to do its own thing with the concept.  In fact, I'm enjoying this a bit more than Monument Valley.Though the graphics are lacking (almost completely), in Hocus, the intrigue of the perspective-twisting mechanic is given more room to breathe, freed from Monument Valley's ham-handed attempts at world-building in this emerging genre that is inherently poorly-suited to real, meaningful world-building.Hocus does one thing and does it well, so I guess you could say it follows the Unix philosophy"

,Recommended,418040,30871598,Posted: 1 April,all,Olde,"hocus is a good, short puzzle game that is based around impossible 3D shapes depicted in 2D, reminiscent of M. C. Escher's style. There are 100 standard puzzles and there is also a Workshop for fan-made content. There is also an editor that is very easy to use for you to make your own puzzles. The art style is minimalistic and the music calm and peaceful. The goal is to direct a small cube from a starting point to a hole on a different place on the shape. You'll need to use the odd nature of the impossible shapes (an ""impossible angle"" as it were) to get the cube from one side to another. Picked it up for $0.49 and I felt it was worth it for that price. I believe you can play this on a smartphone too, so I guess if you need a short, quick brain-teaser to pass the time, this will be enjoyable. Well-optimized and smart, this game doesn't hold your hand, give you any hints, or give you an easy time.One drawback is that while the sound they chose for the cube as it travels along a path makes sense and is good in theory, it can get annoying after a while. Thankfully you can turn off sound effects (and music, too). Also, it's a bit inconsistent in terms of difficulty. Once you get to about the level 20s, it bounces around between solutions that are easy to find and others that are quite difficult and require a lot of trial and error. Another reviewer said that his problem with the game is that you can usually brute force your way through the game and, well, that's kind of true up to a point. Another thing is that there aren't many levels that are memorable. However, I did like the concept, art and sound design, the customization options, and the skill increase among the first twenty or so puzzles. I beat the game (100 puzzles) in 3.8 hours, which leads me to say it took me an average of 2.28 minutes per puzzle, if that's any indication of the amount of time you'd like to spend per puzzle.Ultimately I thought this was a good puzzle game that's very simple to understand and makes you think without bogging you down with text, intros, tutorials or plot. Especially recommended if you enjoy the art style of M. C. Escher.  Worth it if it's on sale in my opinion."

To be honest, the order they are in seems a bit random, from simple to complex, back to simple. (But considering this was a mobile game meant for phones and tablets, before it came to PC, I can see why a ""break"" was put in at places. The thought of all of the smashed-in-rage iPhones and iPads that not giving a break would create... :O )Not too easy, but not too hard. (I am currently at 3 hours of playtime, as of this review being posted, and am stopped at Lvl 42 for a break... not being a superstar puzzle gamer, but not being a total derp either...).Pleasant music, not too intrusive, and IMHO quite relaxing, allowing you to concentrate on the puzzle, while possibly relaxing you too much to pay full attention. Well played.  *wink*I can see ths as being a popular mobile distraction, something that won't disturb others around you, as you play during travels, sit in a waiting room, orrelax in a lobby. For PC, it is a nice break from games that require a ton fof clicking and more active ones that can stress you out. Nice distraction for me from doing programming work from the home office, when I need to silence the inner code-string voices. Not so distracting that I forget about everything, else- it is not a ""full immersion"" type of game. But distracting and relaxing enough to let me rest my thoughts a bit and gather them together again.Nice little puzzler. Recommended for puzzle game enthusiasts, who are not prone to fits of rage.

The levels also require zero skill to complete; one could finish every level with enough moving about as there are no puzzles.Both the repetitiveness and lack of difficulty could be changed with the addition of new mechanics and features as the game progresses.I give this game a substandard 3/10 as after very little time the game becomes boring and too easy."

This allows to traverse all over the object generally, although getting to the target location is often the hardest place to navigate to on the shape.There are plenty of levels to go through, given there are no new mechnics added, just the shapes slowly get more complicated to traverse. But still it is very well implemented and fun to play, and very mind bending.

It's a fun mechanic for a while, but after 65 levels of it, felt a little tiresome and repetitive. Apparently more levels are planned too, though I doubt I'd revisit this game to play them. Sound is minimal but pleasant. For a low price (a dollar or under) I'd imagine this would be worth the money and apparently it's on the app store so I'd say buy it there unless you can get it really cheap here.

The game presents a simple labyrinth that you have to navigate; as should be obvious from the screenshots, there aren't that many branches, so the labyrinths are rather simply structured, if nicely presented. I spent ~2 hours to solve all 65 of these. The problem with this is that this would've taken even less time if the game wasn't so very slow. And I'm not even talking about the 5-second wait as you select a level that is spent watching some simple 2D animation, I'm talking about watching the red cube trundle along with an annoying electronic sound. You see, the cube moves automatically along any leg of the labyrinth once you set it in motion with a swipe of the mouse or a flick of the joystick, because unless it is at a branch it can't go anywhere else anyway, but while you can think 3 turns ahead easily, you have to watch the cube actually complete the journey. Slowly. Which bores me a lot, in fact so much so that I can only take this game in small doses or I'd get the urge to smash things.I suspect this slowness was introduced to hide the fact that there isn't really a lot to the labyrinths - if you could just swipe the cube along the legs quickly, you'd just as quickly blast through the game, which wouldn't be a problem if it had 200 levels or only cost less than a dollar (which it did in the sale).So why would you want to play this? Besides looking cool, the labyrinths are really rather simple (so far, anyway, like I said I've completed 40 of 65), which means there isn't really any feeling of accomplishment that would offset persisting through the annoying slowness of the game which thus becomes its fatal flaw.Unless you want to show off by playing something that looks more like modern art than a game, there's no reason to buy this -- and if you do, you really ought to get it for your smartphone, shouldn't you?"

That's how I felt while solving hocus' puzzles.The game starts off easy and as the levels increase they, the puzzles, become a lot more challenging. You won't be playing against a clock, so loosen up, observe, think and move... or waste your time just moving the cube aimlessly until you find the solution.

,Recommended,418040,25103257,"Posted: 23 August, 2016",all,Murdock,"My review, honestly, may be slightly biased, simply because I am a heavy admirer of Escher's works, and pretty much any other illustration that challenges the eyes' and mind's perception of reality, perspective, and 3D space. However, I'll do my best to make sure my review is balanced.Initially, from a glance at pictures and trailers, this game might look, to some, to be intellectually intimidating. Don't let it intimidate you. I won't lie; as the puzzles progress, each puzzle does get harder and harder. However, admirably, the first few act as easy-peazy tutorials to ease you gently into the evolving entanglement of harder and harder puzzles that come later. The relaxing chime music helps to keep you calm and relaxed, too (trust me; you'll need it with the harder puzzles).The objective of each puzzle is simple in concept: Guide the red cube along the structure until you manage to get it to arrive at the matching red recess elsewhere on the structure. However, as puzzles progress to increasing difficulty and complexity, you will find this harder and harder to accomplish.The ""structures"" are based on the perspective-illusion illustrations by Dutch artist Maurits Cornelis Escher. The objects portrayed in his perspective-illusion illustrations were objects that essentially could not exist in reality (""impossible objects""), but could still be illustrated in perspective based drawings. The general idea of these perspetive illusions have been replicated as puzzles of increasing complexity in this puzzle game.As the puzzles gain in challenge level, you'll find your perception of perspective and 3D space being challenged harder and harder. What you think you see, or thought you saw, is not in fact what is. One plane of travel might at one point be accessible by one means of travel, but then by another from another point. There could be any number of ways to get that little red cube into the little red recess. And it's rare that it will ever be the way you initially think it is.Pros:- Eases you in gently with a few VERY simple tutorial puzzles first.- Very simple graphics and interface; will likely run on most modern machines without trouble.- Very relaxing chime music (although comes through somewhat loud at first, but can always be turned down).- Intellectually engaging (if that's what you like).- Lots and lots of puzzles to occupy you.- A recent feature added: Editor. I haven't tried it yet, but apparently it lets you make your own puzzles (I think). Either way, it sounds like a cool feature to try.- Puzzles are ""unlocked"" as they're completed, allowing you to turn off the game and return to your last spot at any point, as well as play from any previously unlocked puzzle as a starting point the next time you play.- Cheap price tag: I got it on sale 50% off for CDN$1.09, but even with that, the base price comes in at at a comfy CDN$2.18 (PS: not sure what that comes to in USD, but it's probably less, as USD$ is worth more than CDN$, last I checked).Cons:- As mentioned, music comes through a little loud, at first, but can always be turned down.- The mouse control for the game is a little sticky/sluggish feeling at times, but is manageable, if you're patient (the game does say it recommends analog stick on a controller. But I don't have one. But mouse control IS available; just a little sticky/sluggish feeling).Conclusion:If cheap but intellectually engaging puzzle games are something you enjoy - especially if you enjoy geometry, and/or the works of Escher - then this is a game for you. Highly recommended, and totally worth the few cheap bucks. Give it a shot. :)"

This game is just a fun perception puzzle game that mixes the hard and easy to create that ""Ah Ha!"" moment right as you finish the levels. The fact that it might get a level editor is just plain amazing, and makes it alone right now is better, in my opinion, than a lot of small puzzle games I see on steam.The developers are pretty active and listen to the community and the concept is simple, but complex and creative at the same time. It is a type of game that you can play over and over again, and the fact that it is $2 makes that game a pretty good deal.

This is, because the ways you are moving on can be walked on on 4 sides! Every level impressed me with that the right path to walk is so damn weird, you would never think of it being the right one.
