It´s an endless runner, and the only thing that struck me as odd is that there isn´t a settings menu, from what I can tell, but it´s easy to figure out the controls because all you have to control is whether the character jumps or not, and to jump, you just press spacebar. The soundtrack is reminescent of old arcade games and I think it´s cheerful and hapy and super adorable. If the music isn´t to your liking, though, there is the option to turn it down, or completely off.For how cheap it was, how hapy the music is, and how cute the game is, I would say it´s a good deal."

Except sometimes you're a cat or maybe a penguin. But mostly, you're a pug, and you run. You run through day. You run through night. You run through snow. You run through rain (and get electrocuted for your folly.) There are spikes and buzzsaws and lava in your way. There are also treasure chests. You ignore them. You are a pug. You have no thumbs and are too busy running."

It's basically a single game mode, in which each time you die, a new random level (there is some variation) loads up, in different times of the day.The only thing that'll keep you playing is the score and the collectables, which unlock new pets, but there are no in-game or Steam achievements, and you'll probably just leave it on longer than say 20 minutes to get the game's Steam trading cards.Note: careful when you see many positive reviews. I've seen many joke reviews that don't really help you decide if you want the game."

Everytime you start a new run, you get a procedurally generated level. There are multiple characters to unlock. Some of them have special abilities, like doublejumping. This is a fairly difficult game that isn't frustrating to play, at least for me. Something I can't say that about other similar games. What I also like: no pointless game over screens or unnecesary animations but an instant reset to the title screen where you can press Play to start a new run. I just refuse to get mad at this game, no matter how much I die. It's just an addicting nice little casual game."

Being myself, a pug loving weeb, I clicked as fast as I could on the colorful fenomena of a game. No, I didnt even bother watching the trailer because who does that these days, right?After seeing the unbearable price, I called my economical manager to sort things out. We fought for hours and hours on end until I finally managed to get the money I needed. It had taken many loans but as said love for pugs blocked my self consciousness, no questions were ever made from my side. I downloaded the game in a hurry and then played it with joy, stearing into the eyes of the helpless little pug. The pug was life, the pug was love. No one had ever given me such love and compassion as the pug did, no one, ever. Even though the pug showed love, it also brought me evil. I started hearing the pugs little bark on random equations through out my day, and after getting several mental breakdowns on my work place, the beloved friend and boss of mine had had enough.My love for pugs had let me down, leaving me starving on a urine stained street corner in the middle of NYC. My debts were skyhigh as my of my recent pug related loans, my economical manager had also left me, in shame that is. Now I stand here on weak legs with nothing but regrets, writing this review from a strangers macbook at a local 7eleven in hopes of no one falling in the same narrow path as I once did. Please take my word. Love - Halallaren.The gameplay was pretty good though.10/10"

,Recommended,418070,34448399,Posted: 23 August,all,dad,"Here is my amazing review of the game Turbo Pug by Back To Basics Games.It has some charming 8 bit graphics and is what you would expect from an excellent developer of platformer games like this masterpiece. There are different pugs like the the rainbow ""LGBT rights"" pug or the Sombrero ""Don't build the wall"" pug. There are also cats too, but if you need to use them for their advantages you might as well just play as the lgbt pug anyways. There is also a pug point system used to unlock all the charcters with a certain amount of points that you obtain by running and picking up spinning pug heads. The game has no difficulty settings, so if you are bad then please consult a doctor. I recommend muting the soundtrack because its the same 3 notes over and over again so just play darude sandstorm instead. If you are a normie then learn your doggo terminology before play this game. When you are about to beat your highscore you will always die 1 point off, no matter what.Overall rating: yesShould you buy the other Pug games: 10/10Is the game worth it: why havent you bought it yetDO I RECCOMEND? my answer to that is what percent off installation are you at? (probably 100 because its like 15mb)"

The game is responsive, fair and quick to get into. That said, expect to die over and over.The game has three noteworthy flaws:- There should be a keyboard button to restart; preferably the same button you use to jump. As it stands, I find myself leaving my cursor in the middle of the screen just to be able to hit restart qicker.- Occational lightningstrikes will temporarily remove your control over the character: this seems unreasonable for an otherwise very fair game.-Dark spikes and frequent dark backgrounds dont blend well.That said, the game is a good laugh and  a decent time killer. I wouldn't recommend playing for more than a few minutes at a time, but I certainly would recommend those few minutes. It is a simple game, with a simple mechanic, fused with functional procedurally generated levels and some devilishly cute pixel art."

I was drawn in by the design and when I saw it on sale at half price I couldn't resist. I like the concept behind the game and the art style is well done but I do have a few things I am less fond of. For me, the main problem with the game is that there is little motivation to actually play. I'm not asking for an deep storyline or anything but I think the game would be better if it actually challenged and rewarded its players. I found it upsetting that there were all these unique unlockable characters but there is no information on what you need to do to unlock them. You aren't notified when you unlock a new character and it feels like you didn't really accomplish anything to deserve them. The 'pug points' also feel useless and it would be neat if a feature was added where you could use them to buy powerups of some sort to advance further in the game. The world design is a bit bland and repetitive so traveling further doesn't really add to the experience. In my opinon these changes could make the game go from mediorce to fun and addictive. This game isn't for everyone but I would reccomend it to anyone who is a fan of pugs and wants a game to play a few short rounds of in their spare time."

From the charming, relatable pugs & other animals found in Turbo Pug, to the inspiring virtual barks littered throughout the game's gorgeous soundtrack, Turbo Pug attempts what no game has done before, and vastly succeeds. A true revolution in the gaming industry, Turbo Pug not only offers a sense of realism, as the impeccable storytelling of the pug's life, including his mental and physical struggles (i.e. lightning) and his complex love life with Space Kitty offer a narrative never before seen. The game, or, masterpiece, also offers a style of gameplay entirely new to the industry, shaking up the game and acting as a message for triple A developers to step it up. There is a common question asked when dealing with video games... ""are video games considered art?"" Turbo Pug puts an end to this debate, silencing the haters, as there is no doubt in anyone's mind that this game is on par with the Mona Lisa. Turbo Pug deserves a standing ovation, in all honesty.

You even have different types of weather which can influence your gameplay, when you get struck by lighting you can't control your character for a sec, which is a nice little future. Adds a little bit of difficulty to the game. Not that is already hard enough. But it defenitly is pleasantly frustrating.Menu can't be controlled with keys only with the mouse, which interferes with the flow of the game. I want to press space or enter just maintain the flow and quickly start a new game.Character may be a little to small, hard to play with sometimes.

,Recommended,418070,19450195,"Posted: 2 December, 2015",all,Crispy,"Turbo Pug is a fun little game in which you play as, obviously, a pug, but other animals as well. You have to jump your way over gaps, water, lava, and traps to make it as far as you can until you die. The music is nice and I love all the different types of animals (cape pug is my favorite). The only real problem that I have noticed is that during weather changes and the change from night to day normally drops the FPS to about 35 FPS for a second or two. Not that big of a deal but it can be annoying when it causes you to mess up and die. Also I would suggest that the developers add some more content to the game like maybe a shop where you can spend your pug points on new characters or boosts or something like that.9/10"

I mean, pugs are adorable, but there's only so much fun you can get out of a game where you just jump over obstacles and collect points.Apparently I underestimated how much entertainment I would get out of this game, because - although I don't have very many hours logged yet - I've basically done it all in one sitting. It reminds me of the old-fashioned Mario games, actually, except you have the added bonus of adorable animal sprites and music that's really light-hearted and funky.What I really like, too, is that the sprites have different running styles, so even if you get really good at using the pug, for example, you have to relearn the timing of the jumps and whatnot for when you switch to using the cat. This means you can switch it up every once in a while without getting too bored.I don't know how many hours of entertainment I'll get out of this, but it's a great game to play when I've got nothing to do and don't really have the capacity to play a game that requires much thought, like Skyrim. It's the perfect lazy day entertainment.And like I said - I really, really like the music. Though I have to say, the sad animal sound effects when I die are kinda heart-wrenching sometimes.My one negative comment would be that this really starts to hurt my eyes after a while because of the speed at which you're moving, and the screen tends to blur. I have really god-awful eyesight and sensitive eyes to go with it so this is probably a bigger issue for me than it is for other people, but it's something to keep in mind."

They dont have a single thing on Turbo Pug.The beautiful textures, and scenic rolling hills are by far the best I have ever seen in any game. The devs really did it with the fantastic use of Nvidia's hairworks, this feature is overwealmingly important in a game with these adorable furry pugs. Watching their hair blow in the wind as you navigate through the stage is quite satisfying.The levels have been expertly crafted for the absolute best playing experience, platform to platform, box to box.

You, as a pug, automatically run and manually jump past basic obstacles made with generic, if decently used, graphical assets and collect pug head icons that add to a meaningless score.  that is it.  that is literally all there is to it.It's cute, but not worth buying, not even for 49 cents.  There are many far better games in this style that you can play completely free in your browser all over the internet.  Could've been neat for a free app to show the dev's chops for making something cute and simple maybe, at most, but selling it for any price was silly.  Might have been worth it if it came with the two-song soundtrack though, I really liked those songs.Welp, I just spent nearly twice as long writing this review as I did playing the game.  Time to go give myself a pat on the back, and buy a pug."

76561198053667401,Recommended,418070,19244983,"Posted: 23 November, 2015",all,Noob Slayer,"I've never seen as many baseless and inane negative reviews for a genuinely good game as I have for Turbo Pug. While I firmly believe that everyone's entitled to their opinion, I can't accept the amount of distorted, hyperbolic nonsense that’s being perpetrated about this game and I find it hard to tolerate the people who have the gall to berate the game solely because of its shortcomings.----------------------------------------Turbo Pug is a damned good game. However, it definitely has its issues. Space Cat Studios tried new things in this title, some more ambitious than others, and not all of them were successful.It's true that dialogue has been watered down as the devs chose to forgo text conversation choices in favor of a voiced and much more simplified dialogue wheel, which is further hampered by boring choices and weak voice work. Character advancements have been combined into a single perk/SPECIAL sheet. Settlement building, while certainly fun, is mostly aesthetic filler that has little impact on the game world. Side quests far too often amount to just killing some mandatory enemies, particularly with the Pugs (who are supposed to be the ""good guys"" of this installment), and can become repetitive.My most prominent grievance with Turbo Pug is the dialogue overhaul and removal of the biscuit system, which was completely unnecessary and not desired by a single player in existence. Unlike the previous flaws, this thoroughly irks me. I realized that this ties in to the primary weakness of Turbo Pug: its lack of meaningful dialogue in comparison to most Space cat Studios titles. Far too often, your dialogue choices are short, shallow, meaningless, or all three.The only choices that have any outcome are blatantly outlined as persuasion options, a lot of which only help you get some extra kibble. It's not that you should be making major decisions all the time; the problem is that you, as a speaking character, now have a voice that carries no power. What you decide to say is almost always inconsequential. The dialogue system is highly reminiscent of Bad Rats except watered down; the reason it doesn't work in Turbo Pug is that the two games have totally different approaches to conversation. The previous Space Cat Studio games had much better dialogue options because they meant something. Sometimes, your choice of words just made someone hate you, allowed you to entice or inspire others, or developed your reputation through the biscuit system. Now that biscuit is gone, your choices are just that much more pointless.The bottom line is that Space Cat Studios sacrificed a tremendous amount of RPG dialogue elements to accommodate full voice-work. While it was an ambitious attempt, it was an all-around mistake and it sticks out like a sore if you're a fan of Space Cat Studios games or RPG's in general. The dialogue wheel system could have worked out just fine, but Space Cat Studios carried it out in the wrong way.----------------------------------------All the aforementioned flaws are some of the most central complaints naysayers have about Turbo Pug and yet not a single one of them has been horrific enough to ruin my experience or let me down. Despite the few bugs I've come across, despite the certain questionable and sometimes idiotic design choices Space Cat Studios made here, this game is still extremely well done. I still feel that incomparable thrill that only Turbo Pug can bring.Even though Turbo Pug falls extremely short on dialogue and all aspects associated with it, it's still an improvement over its predecessors in almost every other way imaginable. The game suffers some graphical issues like muddy textures and poor lighting at times, like any good Space Cat Studios game, but it's still astoundingly beautiful and even breathtaking at times. Movement, melee, gunplay, and physics are better and smoother than they've ever been.People were quick to judge the Pugworld map based on its size and I was prepared to be disappointed as well, but it's surprisingly the best one Space Cat Studios has whipped up thus far. The suburban locations are more organically dispersed and things become more compressed as you near the cities. Streets are narrow, buildings are tall, and locations are absolutely jam-packed alongside a ton of unmarked ruins and buildings you can enter. There are hardly any copy-pasted environments and they all show great attention to detail.I was also worried that granting access to Jowls and a Bone within the first thirty minutes of the game would be a huge balancing issue as well, but it really isn’t. The jowls rely on uncommon fusion slobber goobs for power and you’re not an unstoppable god while weilding the jowls, especially not at higher difficulties or levels. You can acquire some strong weapons like the Bad or Rat relatively early but finding sufficient ammo is another matter entirely.----------------------------------------Gta V was a simplification of the Bad Rats formula, but it was still a fantastic game. In much the same way, Turbo Pug is a simplification of the Call of Duty:Ghosts formula and is still extremely good. Even in light of its issues, this game has not been a disappointment at all. RPG elements can be enhanced through the wonderful modding community and will eventually make up for some of the game's weaker points, a perk of being a PC gamer. Space Cat Studios has, however, been on a recent trend of simplifying their games too much and I hope they change course.Truthfully, the negative Steam reviews had me partly worried that I’d be disappointed but I chose to disregard them and arrive at my own opinion. I’ve learned that nearly every point of contention was blown out of context. The few issues that haven’t been redeemed in my eyes still pale in the face of the tremendous work that was done to bring this new and beautiful Turbo Pug world to life. I have no doubt that the naysayers worked up their expectations to heights beyond reason, and it’s therefore no mystery that they hit the ground so hard afterwards. I chose to see Turbo Pug for what it is rather than what I expected or imagined it to be: a lovingly crafted game that, despite being marred by some of its shortcomings, has that same engaging splendor that far supercedes its flaws.I highly recommend you try the game and approach it with a neutral and reasonable demeanor, and you won’t be disappointed."

It tells one of the best stories in gaming that not everyone can pick up on in the first playthrough.  It tells the story of a pug running away from his past.  He has the face the trials of life, both physically and metiphorically.  On his long journey, he faces everything from his own imagination's problems, like desire (thus shown by currency) or his own physical fears, like heat and water.  He has to travel through a near future's war-based economy and landscape.  This can be shown the traps set up and the currency without a value.  Weather itself even poses a problem for him.  When defeated, the end can be shown in two different prespectives. The first is an infinite time loop.  He could very well be trapped in his own personal inferno that he can't cope with.  He has to keep traveling until he can conquer his inner fears or reach happiness.  Either that or whenever one pug is defeated, another follows his leaders path, giving the game a good sense of leadership and belonging.  The gameplay alone is a reason to buy the game.  It is simple yet innovative.  Unlike other games today, like Battlefront and Fallout, it brings something new.  Save your 60 dollars and buy this work of art.  GOTY."

Some ""characters"" got special skills like double jump or less gravity, but they play similarly.There are two different happy songs playing in the background which alternate each death.

The game only uses one button.  It couldn't have been that hard to program in an Xbox 360 interface.  I'm putting Turbo Pug on the shelf for now.  Hopefully we'll see some gamepad support in the future and then I'm going to make my pug puppy fly!"

So here are some PROS and CONS.PROS:1. The controls are so simple, you just click!2. You get a large choice of characters, 12 of them to be exact.3. It is the 2nd prettiest game I have ever played.4. It's very hard, which is something that I havn't seen in a while.5. You play as a pug. Nuff said.6. The penguin. Thats all that can be said.7. The soundtrack is amazing!As you can see, this is already a very great game, so just get the game now.CONS:1. It's so hard to see when its snowing!2. It just doesn't make sense why a pug is running though a forest!3. How is the lava not burning the crates!4. Why is a cat wearing a space helmet?Most of these are just things that dont make logical sense so far. Don't worry! I'll fix it.5. Don't right click when you are doing great.6. The entire game would make alot more sense if you played as a bird or something, I don't know.Sadly, the game makes so sense whatsoever. BUT it is $0.99, so that kind of fixes it.It is just an indie platformer game, so the cons are acceptable.So if you like indie games, play this.Also, I recomend getting The Pug Life bundle, all three games (and soon the be four) are great.Also, if you do play, heres some tips.1. Don't die.2. Play as the pug with the cape, rainbow butt, or the one with the pumpkin on its head.3. Don't break your mouse.That's all I can give you!Again, the game is great. Pick it up sometime, you may get a smile when you play!And, beat the high score of 222,222."

Also a bonus level that involves a couch and after running 15 minutes the couch level is just farting/snorting/sneezing while lying there for hours on end intil there is food and then 15 minutes of running. Rinse and repeat. Great game, money well spent."

What makes it especially annoying is every time your pug dies the main menu reappears, making you launch from there.  There's no quick and easy restart function and if your pug so much as bumps into anything he's dead.  Maybe it's because I'm trying to play using only a keyboard & mouse on my PC, but all I do is sit here & hit the spacebar until my pug dies.  How is that a game/fun?Mario he ain't, to his disadvantage.  Time to uninstall."

The music tracks are pretty simple and use a dog barking SFX, but it's not done in an obnoxious manner. The game itself can be hard to see at times due to the visual effects, and the gray spikes blend in with the background a bit much. The worst aspect is the random thunderstorms, which can completely ruin your run. It's the only detrimental RNG factor, as the generated maps are all capable of being solved if you have the skill for it. Overall, if you like pugs a lot you probably will get this game anyway, but it's just average."

There are other controls listed such as 'fire' but none of them actually exist in-game as pressing the said button for such functions dont actually have such or even any result, theres also an option to use a Controller but the controller doesnt actually work in the gameThe 'leaderboards' feature is also a lie as not only is the entire leaderboard just full of '9r' scores but they arent actually online scores, its just a made up leaderboard within the gameThe 'procedurally generated levels' feature is a lie too as they arent procedurally generated but rather its just several different levels that get chosen at randomthe game also has a 'graphics' setting which is a lie too (not to mention wtf would you need a graphics setting on a game like this anyways), changing the graphics setting does absolutely nothing and the game was made on GM8 so ofcourse you cant change the graphics settings...It would be nice if when you held the Jump button, that you actually continued jumping every time you landed back down but as it is; you have to keep pressing the Jump button after every time you landTheres 6 'pugs' to choose from (2 of which look like cats but hey, they must be Pugs because the game says 'choose your pug') but they arent just cosmetic changes, and are unbalanced as its just the further you go down the list of Pugs, the more times that you can do an airbourne jump, so clearly, the one at the end of the list of pugs to choose from is the best. Oh, and why is there a gay pug?Theres only 2 songs and both are mindnumbing and don't suite the pace of the game, they also both start when your Pug dies instead of when you start the session, so you end up starting to play when the song is part way throughSo yeah, theres a lot of miss-advertisement in this game and a lot of lies but the biggest lie of them all is this review, so yeah, you go out there and you spend that 69 pence because this game will bring a whole lot more happyness than what the tryptophan will give you in a 69 pence pack of bananas #y u so mad? peace"

Sometimes it stops counting for some reason.This super simple, barebones, yet adorable little game is well worth your 99 cents.It's in the style of games like Geometry Dash and Impossible Game in that you have a little character (pug) that continuously runs to the right, and you have to jump over and onto stuff while avoiding obstacles.I figured I'd enjoy it for a half hour or so and be done with it, as it's super basic. Only two music tracks that quickly get lose their mild pleasantness after hearing them for the 12th time. Repetitive obstacle sets which repeat themselves often mixed in with occasional randomized infuriating difficulty spikes.But somehow it all works. I found myself playing this for an hour at a time just to get aslightlyhigher score.Plus it has a nice selection of alt-pugs with slightly different characteristics (one double jumps, another is floaty etc.), along with a pinguin. The pinguin is just obviously a sad joke from the developers. He's super slow and cannot even clear his first jump. :(Pick this up instead of a candy bar. It's deceptively engaging and adorable."

It's a cheap, casual game, and you get exactly what you expect. I'm sure it would be a fun in-between game while waiting in queue in some MMO. Oh and the background music is fantastic, I love how catchy it is."

Everything from the amazing soundtrack, the stellar graphics, the in depth story line and great voice acting puts this game years, if not decades ahead of this time. No other game can compare to the months, if not years, that the developers spent slaving at their computers coding this masterpeice. This game should not be on steam.  It should be on its own platform where only games with such artistic talent and amazing game play such as this masterpiece. If I was on an island and I could only bring one thing, it would be this. 10/10 masterpeice would recommend to any gamer. Excited to see this become an Esport in the coming years. The best game on steam."
