,Not Recommended,418120,33526089,Posted: 13 July,all,Dustin Gunn,"This game has really poor design. Usually, design isn't the first thing you notice in a game, but here you can't miss it.You get more and more weapons and can only scroll through them in 1 direction with a single button press.15 total weapons, but since they level up from use, you're punished for using anything but the shotgun.A shop system that incentivizes making your first 4-5 purchases be coin multipliers because the cost of real upgrades is so high (takes a full hour of gametime.)A hitbox that's far larger than your sprite, combined with enemies that damage you far beyond their own (especially the knife guys.)""Charge Shot."" This upgrade could not be less consequential, and the game goes out of its way to explain it to you.The description claims it has a metroidvania-style map. In the 4 areas I played, it had 2 branches. I'm guessing the map system was added after most of the game had been finished because it's not necessary.2 dedicated buttons for the roll move. One for left and one for right. But you can only press them if you're facing the right direction. Do I need to explain further why this was such a bad design choice?Not capping firing rate and making guns really, really weak to compensate. Makes every weapon feel the same (weak.) Throwing 100 bombs at a spider only to have it shrug it off is silly.Speaking of spiders, there's no balance here. Enemies go up and down in difficulty with no logic. Why are spiders tougher than giant soldiers with bazookas? Why does the slime boss take 20 minutes minimum to kill? Also, weapons: the assault rifle comes after the shotgun but is objectively worse.Sound design: There's no location music, which is a huge misstep. Music just seems to play from one big playlist. It hurts locations' sense of identity. Killing bees plays the sound of an insect flying up to your ear. That would imply it appearing, not disappearing. Jumps and double-jumps have the same sound. Direwolves wiffing attacks making a crunching sound. Are they chewing on air?Lack of invincibility frames when getting hurt. It's a fairly easy game but this is still a mistake. The difference between losing 1 or 3 hearts comes down to a fraction of a second.The weapon upgrade screens that steal control and block all vision. These always happen when you're in the middle of fighting something. My first death was entirely caused by this.Too many features. More than half of them feel unnecessary. Why can you increase your hearts in the shop AND by collecting xp orbs? Why have all these collectables of different types without explanation? The game is so big and repetitive, it's not like you're going to remember where to backtrack to. The ability upgrades you get feel random and unearned. The ""power"" upgrade especially. All enemies have less maximum health now? I can't even see their HP, but it seems they went from taking 100 shots to 95. Why wouldn't you increase damage instead? The player can actually see that number. The shop and menu screens are all overcomplicated for what they offer. You have to go through 3 screens to reach your inventory.You can upgrade your melee weapon but it's obvious from early on that it's strictly a defensive tool. If the upgrade does more than increase damage, there's no hint of it.The presentation tries hard but the timing and sound effects are off. Every enemy and boss gets an intro but they don't have much punch. Getting weapons tries for the megaman thing but again feels kinda limp. The worst, as previously mentioned, is when you upgrade a weapon and the game suddenly cuts to black (while you're fighting.) The new area intros would be cool but, again, the game doesn't have localized music so there's not enough atmosphere.The game warns you of ""crazy bosses"" right before dropping you into the fight with the giant wolf. This fight is the opposite of crazy.The world design and storytelling. Since there are so many cutscenes, you kind of expect there to be a logic to the world. Why does your nemesis throw bombs harmlessly on the ground before flying away every time you see him? I assume the pirates are his minions but that's not brought up. I know this is the 3rd game, but who is Cally? Even in sequels you need setup. There's so much (too much) dialog but it never uses it constructively.This game isn't terrible but it's clear most of the work went into its graphics and that the game design had a kitchen sink approach where aspects of the creator's favorite games were just added in without thought."

I still recommend it for a couple of use cases:1) If you actually aren't paying that much attention, like playing and using one of those under the desk bikes2) To introduce people who might not have played a lot of games to important concepts like platforming and exploration in a forgiving environment (which it seems like this would be really good for!)3) Because it's got a pretty rad soundtrackAnyway, it's fun and silly and well worth the $5."
,Recommended,418120,24058747,"Posted: 3 July, 2016",all,Barkie_Mailman,"This game is easily worth the full price. Here's the list of things that I'm loving so far:-Lots of unlockable ablilities and guns-Guns gain levels and evolve into new forms. They get different animations/ firing rates / projectice quantities etc.-Guns gain experience by dealing damage and not by kills.-Controls are excellent-It's just plain fun!I have no major complaints about this game at all. However, If I could change a few things, here is what they would be:-The charge shot ability charges itself, and your next shot will do 3x damage when the guage is full. However this only charges about once per 60 or 120 seconds (not sure...but it feels like forever for something so minor). Seems like you should just be able to hold the attack key and charge a shot whenever.-There are 2 power ups in the game that are too similar. One raises your attack damage, and the other lowers all enemy health. So basically they both just cause enemies to take fewer hits to kill, but one powerup is visible to me and the other I just have to assume is working. Now the major difference is that the health lowering powerup does not work against bosses, so why not just make them all damage increasing powerups, and give the bosses more health? One of the best elements of the game is waching the gun damage increase.All in all I think this is great. Would buy a sequel instantly!"

I'm going to list a few of the pros+cons I've observed so far:Pros:Aesthetic is niceControls feel solidWeapon upgrade system works well and is a lot of funCons:No analog support?Lots of weird gameplay systems (being able to fight the first boss over and over. I used him to grind my shotgun to level 10 in about 10 minutes).Music doesn't follow the gameplay very well (title screen music just keeps playing when you press start and is the background music for that area of the game)Enemy AI seems really rudimentary (granted I'm early in the game so this might change) walking left/right on a platformIts a nice little game, albeit very rough around the edges. But for 10 bucks its a decent value (though it feels like a 5 dollar game TBH).EDIT: Apparently the version I bought was the deluxe version. The regular version wasn't available at the time I purchased it. The 6.99 price point seems pretty fair."
,Recommended,418120,23233401,"Posted: 27 May, 2016",all,TheVulpineHero1,"To describe Cally's Caves 3 succinctly, I would say ""2D Ratchet and Clank""; it's an action platformer with a large array of guns which level up as you use them, hideous amounts of money pickups and multipliers for them, and the requisite extremely expensive weapons mods on which to spend them.For what it is, it's a competent little game that's quite moreish thanks in no small part to the weapon upgrade system. Anybody with completionist urges will end up wanting to level the arsenal to the max, and the guns are fairly diverse (although there are issues with the selection; more on that later.) The graphics are quite crisp and appealing.On the soundtrack, I feel more or less neutral. While the songs that are on there are pretty decent, and suit the game well, there are no specific 'stage' tracks; for much of the game, the library minus the boss fight songs will just be looping in the background, no matter where you happen to be. Because of that, it feels like there wasn't too much conscious design behind it all from the game's devs. On the plus side, though, this means you can easily turn the music to zero and then play your favourite album or listen to a stream in the background. And again, what's there is pretty decent.The weapon arsenal both benefits and suffers from the Ratchet and Clank syndrome the game has going on. At first it feels like all weapons are viable but some weapons are more viable than others depending on the situation. You might dps with your pistol, and use your shotgun to chip away at enemies you can't quite reach without putting yourself in danger, for example. By the end, however, you have the R.Y.N.O element coming into play -- i.e. there is a single gun in your arsenal that will outclass any other given gun in almost any situation, and the only reason to not use it is because you're trying to level up a worse gun. This is actually worse in Cally's Caves than in Ratchet and Clank games, however, because the developers have helpfully furnished you with infinite ammo -- meaning if you don't want to change weapon to use something worse, you never have to. Let's just say that you'll probably be using the Laser a lot, and leave it at that. That said, some of the guns are genuinely quite novel, particularly the spike gun, which has a lot of outside the box applications for the creative.One annoyance is that most of the guns fire faster if you spam the button than if you hold it. I don't really get why this is the case (it isn't hard to mash buttons, although it can become a little tiring and unnecessary); I'd love there to be some kind of endgame upgrade that pulls the auto fire all guns come with up to a reasonable human button speed, if only to save the wear and tear on my controller.I also feel like the expected difficulty of the game is off. I'm not great at action platformers; I play sloppily, I tank damage for convinience, I jump in the lava to skip obnoxious moving block puzzles, the whole shebang. I've 100%ed this game, with the exception of two achievements: one for dying 100 times, and another for dying 250 times. How many times have I actually died, in the course of the game and new game plus and survival mode and the bonus Melvin Zone and Beara's quest segments? 12, and all of those came quite early in the first run. You get so much more powerful than the game can effectively handle, and it just sort've runs out of tricks halfway through new game+. It doesn't feel like a stereotypically 'kid' difficulty game (especially not considering your protagonist has a vast arsenal of firearms, and it ends withyou personally stabbing your best friend's evil dad hard enough to knock him off a cliff and into a pit of lava. Some of the tricks used to hide collectibles are stuff that usually you'd see more often in the Mario romhacking community, like leaving the ceiling open and expecting the player to walk outside the edges of the screen, and enemies in the lategame get pretty bullet spongey. I think you just scale too hard for the game to effectively kill you, regardless of how sloppily you play.Overall, the game is pretty enjoyable, in a kind of mindless, rompy way. If it goes on sale, you're unlikely to regret reaching for your wallet. Recommended."

The platforming isn’t particularly difficult, you start with Double Jump and then get Triple Jump very early on. The games controls are responsive and almost all the weapons are semi-automatic with no delay in-between shots. This gives a very satisfying 1:1 ratio of button mashes to shots fired.All your weapons gain exp and level up. The exp is gained every time a weapon shot hits, rather than it being based on kills or pickups. This makes failed levels and boss attempts not feel like a waste of time as you retain the exp even if you die. The weapon leveling gives a nice feeling of constant progression throughout the game.The game is very simple, you pretty much just jump and shoot things the entire time. Don’t expect a Metroidvania, the game is very linear with very few side areas and doesn’t have much in the way of secrets to find. I never really got the sense that I was exploring anything, mainly just collecting all the money and then looking for the exit to the next area. But this game is very fun for what it is, it’s great for when you don’t feel like thinking and just wanna hop around and blast things.The game uses the Dpad rather than Left Stick for movement so be prepared to fix this with your favorite third party program such as xPadder.-Playtime-8-10 hours for first play through. New Game+ is substantially quicker because you retain your weapons and their levels which makes things much quicker even though it has tougher enemies.-Achievements-Nothing fantastic here, mainly just getting all the collectables. Only 2-3 of which I would consider to actually be hidden, most are just found with a thorough exploration of each area. Finishing up the Max All Weapons achievement took less than an hour and didn’t feel too grindy. I did however use Turbo on my controller to speed this up quite a bit. The biggest grind was the 250 Deaths achievement, I only died maybe a dozen times playing though the whole game and New Game+. I ended up just going to a boss fight, setting up a macro and leaving for an hour to get this.Recommended on sale."

,Recommended,418120,23526212,"Posted: 12 June, 2016",all,Kohmei,"This game is something of a mixed bag, but at its core there is a really enjoyable (and addictive) game if you can tolerate its various faults.Cally's Caves 3 is a simplistic high-paced action platformer that has you explore a fairly diverse and colorful set of locales. Along your way you will discover a ton of different weapons, each with its own strategic use, and each that can be upgraded simply through usage, which results in bigger, badder weapons that do more damage, have more range, increased projectile count, etc depending on the weapon and upgrade level. Weapons not only perform better through upgrading but have several different visual forms, so the satisfaction from upgrading is very much apparent.Through your progression you will slay tons of enemies, which drop your usual EXP and currency. EXP increases your character level, which only determines how much life you have. The game's currency is used to buy an assortment of upgrades, including gold drop modifiers, weapon modifiers, health regen and others. There are also a variety of collectibles hidden throughout the game, with high-level weapons upgrades unlocking as an incentive to collecting them.The game is quite long for the price, offering easily 15 hours of content for completionists. The main story consists of 110 levels, which can be repeated in a new game plus mode that features different and more challenging enemy layout and minor differences in physical layout as well, making the content still feel quite fresh. In addition, there is also a survival mode where you must survive 150 waves of enemies in one sitting, and a collection of post-game levels that are best experienced once you have fully upgraded everything.This is all held back, or held hostage it sometimes feels like, by some baffling design choices. In a game that has 15 odd weapons once you've collected them all, there is only one single button to swap weapons. Skip by the weapon you wanted? Well, you'll have to go through the entire loop again, to get back to it. Don't accidentally skip it a second time. (This will happen A LOT.)The user interface is clunky and poorly designed. Accessing your inventory and the map are arduous tasks, with both hidden behind multiple menu options. Cursor selection on the map screen behaves erratically with directional buttons often not going where you'd expect them to go or being outright unresponsive.The game's soundtrack is bland and completely forgettable and does nothing to add to the atmosphere of any of the levels, as all of the levels have the same set of tracks that play continually on a loop. That is not to say that there isn't a variety in the music, as there is, it is just an odd choice that each level has the same loop of tracks rather than selecting a different track from that loop to correspond with each thematic set of levels.Finally, the platforming is extremely basic as you can only move left and right, and jump. You cannot aim up, or move up, or duck, or shoot down, or jump down through platforms. Doors are even entered automatically, which can be quite frustrating if it was not your intent to change areas. Enemy strategy is thus a fairly straight forward matter of avoiding standing on the same plane while you jump to avoid projectiles.Overall I would call it a good action platformer that is lacking a professional level of polish, with the price tag being justified by the amount of playtime you are likely to get out of it."

,Not Recommended,418120,25883998,"Posted: 6 October, 2016",all,Push King,"Do you like to play games? Well, good news. This is definitely, undeniably, 100% an actual game that you can play.I purchased it because it looked like a skill based platformer with a solidly 16 bit aesthetic. What I wound up with was a barely finished GameMaker mash-a-thon. Simply put... it's just a damn mess. Even on the first level the graphic elements are all aligned improperly, causing your bullets to disappear behind set pieces and pop up again on the other side. That sort of corners-cut, barely finished feel plagues the rest of the game.Then there's the complete lack of skill necessary to play. Most of the enemies you'll encounter aside from bosses simply pace back and forth and are easily cheesed. The primary exception to this rule are situtions where you've got limited maneuverability and an enemy barreling towards you, in which case the solution is to just mash as hard as you can.Also the art... Yeah, there is a 16 bit aesthetic, but a lot of the graphics are half done. The animations mostly go between terrible and non-existant, making the movements feel a lot more leaden and unresponsive than they actually are. Cally jumps with nothing but a little bounce in her pigtails to signify motion, the roll functions more like a limited dash and it's only real usefulness is to get in spaces that are literally just 5-10 pixels shorter than your character sprite and always just one block wide.The sound design is pretty terrible, too. At best many of the sound effects sound like the kind of stock, royalty-free stuff that you used to buy on CDs at computer shows. At their worst, a lot of the sound effects are terribly mismatched to the items they're associated with, trigger at odd times, and stick out like a sore thumb. The music isn't great either. It succeeds at matching the graphics' 16 bit feel... but it's pretty boring and repetitive. I wound up turning it off in favor of my own soundtrack after a while.It's not all bad news though. There's an interesting parry mechanic where you can deflect enemy projectiles with the melee attack although the bullets track the nearest enemy causing the sprites to do weird things. There's lots of weapons to choose from but... to be honest, it's too many. You level up each one by using it and it doesn't take long before there are so many weapons that you can't level them all effectively which winds up really limiting your options for how you can approach some encounters. Some of the boss sprites are pretty nice to look at too. King Carl particularly.There's a lot of potential here, but most of it goes unrealized. I guess there are 3 of these games now and I can't help but feel that maybe if the developer had just continued to work on one game for the entire life of this franchise and then doubled the budget for sound and art, you'd have something really special that you wouldn't mind shelling out 5-10 bucks for.

,Not Recommended,418120,23942229,"Posted: 29 June, 2016",all,Imban,"Cally's Caves 3 is an interesting platformer, but one bogged down with extremely low difficulty and dubious grinding mechanics. It controls well and offers a wide variety of weapons - 15 guns (and bombs), plus a sword - for you to use against your opposition, but its origin as a mobile port seems to show in that actual platforming skill is rarely ever required. There are essentially no difficult jumps and very few timed jumps, and enemies can almost always be defeated at no risk to yourself by choosing a gun that can hit them while standing in a location where they can't attack you. Even if you manage to get hurt, by the end of the game you'll have 20 health (with no enemies dealing more than 2 damage in a single hit), passive health regeneration, and four or five full health refills in your inventory at all times if you somehow need them. In addition, your sword stuns all non-boss enemies, rendering them harmless in melee range as long as you hit your sword button every 1.5 seconds or so.Despite its low level of difficulty, Cally's Caves 3 is still a rather long game: 111 short stages, a NG+ version of those 111 stages, then a 150-wave survival mode, a short ""Bera's Quest"" mode where you play as the melee-only bear you occasionally have to play in the normal game, and a 33-stage Melvin's Zone which is supposed to be a final post-game challenge. It took me about 12 hours to complete, though I took a break with the game running at one point, so it's probably more like 11.The gun system is likewise neat - fifteen different weapons, including the basic pistol you start with, a heat-seeking rocket launcher, a gun that shoots slimes that bounce along the ground and up walls, landmines, and a gun that shoots harpoons that you can use as platforms, including while they're in mid-air - but they all level up by hitting enemies, so once you've maxed out a gun, you tend to stop using it, especially since there's no real difficulty that would cause you to need your good guns. Given that all the guns get a final upgrade when they hit their maximum level, I thought this was an annoying oversight in design.Cally's Caves 3 isn't a bad deal at $5 for a game that takes more than 10 hours to beat, but it never really hooked me into wanting to play more or actively enjoying it, as opposed to just feeling that it was something to do and that I was, I supposed, making progress. Given the wide variety of indie platformers on PC, many of high quality, I sadly can't recommend Cally's Caves 3."

,Not Recommended,418120,25855766,"Posted: 4 October, 2016",all,DEATH,"Immediately upon starting this game, I felt something off with the presentation. The first clue was from the lack of music and visual transition from title screen to game play. This gave me the impression that the game is a little rushed and unpolished. Continuing just a bit further and talking to the first NPC (forcibly I might add) I noticed you can't really skip the dialogue and advancing the dialogue seems to be a bit wonky. Usually requiring a few mashings of the A button to get passed one sentence for some reason.Once the real meat of the game play began, I painfully realized the lack of variable jumping, just a single fixed jump height. So right off the bat the game play feels clunky. The shooting isn't much better, a very slow auto-fire if you hold the button and seemingly no cap on how fast you can fire a weapon if you mash the button. This includes the shotgun, which doesn't feel ANYTHING like a shotgun, more like a spread powerup for the pistol. This being the case, the shotgun is basically a flat out replacement of the pistol, since it covers more space and because of the fixed jump height, this becomes very important for hitting your targets.The next crime this game commits is the pitifully boring enemies, the ""walk back and forth, bullet-sponge"" type. These suckers take up the first 2 zones of the game, many different sprite swaps and some slight behavioral changes. They take so many shots to put down and are mostly harmless unless you walk right into 'em. This creates a really boring combat experience.That's about all I gathered from this game. I didn't play it beyond 2 zones (a handful of rooms and 1 ""boss""). This game is extremely easy from what I played and I know I'll probably hear that it ""gets harder"" but this game doesn't do much to give off a good first impression from the first few levels so I can't see the design getting any better later in the game, even if it got more difficult, it wouldn't get more engaging.Overall, this game looks and plays like a ""my first game"" type project with plenty of rough edges, bad design decisions and generic concepts. However, it isn't completely awful. Definitely a playable game and not too bad if it is a first-game project. That being said, some gamers who may be a bit more forgiving then me might find some small enjoyment out of this game. For anyone looking for another great shooter/platform game to play, this isn't that game. Either way, this game is simple and unpolished so only pay a dollar or two if you are interested in it, any more than that and you would be getting ripped off.Final words: go in with low expectations."

I would describe it as a cross between Megaman, Metroidvania, Contra and Zelda 2. I highly recommend it. The only downside is that it glitched for me at the last boss when I fell it to the lava and I couldn't get out. The only thing that I could do is reset and start from the most recent checkpoint which is a couple of levels before the last boss. Since you are almost guarenteed to fall in the lava at the last boss, this glitch makes the game almost unbeatable. Other than that, I highly recommend it (especially on sale).

Bad design)-Overpowered weapons (really? You can just hit the enemies with the sword and they get stunned, so repeat that untill they die.

Things aren't ridiculously difficult even on New Game + mode (Harder for sure though!) It might be small for a game, but it has excellent replay value. The controller works quite nicely but of course the sticks don't; perhaps this is due to it playing like Metroid series? It certainly gives a vibe of such a game as Cally will have to backtrack every so often.This game is a fair crossover of Metroid X Ratchet & Clank (the more you have Cally use her weapons, they change as they grow!), with a hint of Contra (2D shooting with a variaity arsenal of weapons to use on the run) without the ""you will die in one hit!"" factor or dropping anything were any casualties do happen, and a hint of Megaman (the map, bosses, grabbing upgrades changes abilities and so on). Oh but guess what? Liked running a boss fight? You can have Cally go right back and fight it again and again! They don't stay down, this is a plus when there was a cool boss fight to do and someone wants her to duel the enemy again!Now, if only there were a few things ahead in the next episode:-appearance could change after Cally gets upgraded armor/parts or whatever,-can customize her looks (optional, like buying costumes, accessories, etc. for appeal) ,-add in a Variable charge cannon or something to give that ""hold to charge up and BOOM!"" kind of feel of a weapon (legendary!)-perhaps add a custom character creation/addition option/mode and where the created character(s) can interact with Cally too? (far optional, but will be quite cool!)But what can I say? It's still a great little game! It never crashes or has any errors. The graphics may seem retro, but it's also that less demanding for almost any PC to run perfectly smooth, which helps! The only thing that got me frustrated was the Bee Boss, having been far more fatal than the True Last boss himself of casual story mode. Regardless, get this one! Worth the buy, the price is good, no regrets!"

You control Cally across different stages and levels to reach the final boss to rescue your parents. The game is decent overall, but there are some improvements that can be had.Storyline - it's a pretty short storyline so don't expect any story rich scenes. Imagine Mario where you are constantly travelling across different stages/levels to reach the end.Weaponry gameplay - there are a wide variety of weapons to play with and they do upgrade themselves as you continue to use them to level up. While this is nice in that it keeps the player entertained, I find this large weaponry a hassle as I don't end up using each of them equally. Some weapons are more useful than others and I think others are just plain useless in a lot of the cases when you are trying to shoot at an enemy. In addition, having to cycle through all the weapons consistently was a nuisance. I wish you can deselect which weapons you don't want to use or have an easier system of accessing the weapon you want to use at a specific time. Next, the amount of money needed to purchase weapon upgrade is ridiculously high. Even with multipliers, I don't see myself wanting to keep playing the game to complete the collection.Gameplay - the game is easy enough and forgiving considering how many checkpoints you have. It is even more forgiving considering the HP regen and consumables you can buy overtime as well as the lamp to restart at a specific stage of the level if you die before you reach the next checkpoint. Althought the price can be steep, once you get the multiplier stacked up, it becomes slightly easier to purchase the consumables. There are some areas during the gameplay where enemies or items will clip through walls or fall through the ""cracks"". That or you are stuck being walls and are forced to restart from the last check point as you can't get out. Sometimes, it's annoying since it can be a heart that you need, consumable, or it's the boss fight and you have to restart it.Overall, Cally's Caves 3 is an amusing game to play, but it's definitely a completionist's nightmare. The soundtrack is exceedingly repetitive and even with just 3 hrs in, I really don't want to hear anymore of it right now. I've collected all the regular weapons and I don't even envision myself wanting to max-level and get the final weaponry via the collectibles (which is an ordeal all by itself). In addition, I rather not encounter more buggy gameplay throughout the game, which seems to be more frequent in the new game+ and Melvin's Zone. Luckily, getting it on sale for $2.99 doesn't make me too bummed out with the game, but I don't think the replay value is that high for a game like this. 6.5/10."
