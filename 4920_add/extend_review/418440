Enter for inventory / objectives, arrows for everything else.Inventory is automated, if you have what you need, you'll do what you have to without even having to look at it.The graphics are pretty good IMO (I love that kind of colourful pixel art).The music is generally OK.It's pretty cheap. So if you're looking for a nice short puzzle game, just buy it."

76561198042646749,Recommended,418440,34123609,Posted: 9 August,all,kris.aalst,"Tick Tock Isleis a third-person pixel art adventure game that contains a little arcade-style platforming, too. I had a lot of fun withTick Tock Isleand while it only takes two hours to finish the game, its price is very fair so I certainly recommend it to anyone who thinks they may enjoy a game of this genre.StoryYour name is Strike and you're summoned to an island to fix a clock in a mansion. When you get there, you find the mansion seemingly abandoned but you do find the clock. After tinkering around with the clock a bit, it teleports you through time to the year 2009.In 2009, the mansion is full of life. You'll meet the ten inhabitants of the mansion and try to fix the clock - sorry, try to fix the time machine in order to find your way home. Soon you notice you can easily travel back and forth between the year 2009 and 2010. And you'll find that things you do in 2009 have an impact on the mansion and its inhabitants in 2010, of course. Could this be the key to fixing the clock and returning to your own time?Tick Tock Isleis not a visual novel and the narrative is a rather basic time travel story, but its writing is entertaining and cute in its innocence. Strangely, although the game is set in 2009 and 2010, there are a lot of references to 1980s and 1990s pop culture.GameplayTick Tock Isleplays like a point & click adventure game but without the pointing and the clicking. Yeah, I know how that sounds, but bear with me here. You wander around the mansion, talk to its inhabitants, collect items and use those on the correct target NPC or object to advance the story. The only real difference is that instead of using the mouse to point and click your way through the game, you use the keyboard to control your avatar.When Strike is near a spot where he can perform an action (pick up an item, interact with an object or NPC, use an item, …) you'll get an on-screen prompt and just have to press a button to have him perform the required action. So there's no pixel hunting and no 'using everything from your inventory on everything' inTick Tock Isle.When you press the Enter key, you see a status screen containing your inventory and a short description of each item you've collected, a brief checklist of things you're required to do, the current year and a crude map of the mansion. The map doesn't help much, really, but the mansion isn't that huge, so you'll soon find your way around without needing a map anyway.On about five occasions, you're required to go through a minigame to get an item you need. The minigames are short, basic platformer levels you need to go through. This involves jumping (none of those insanely difficult jumps you need to time perfectly, though), killing or avoiding monsters, dodging bullets and even one 'boss fight' at the end of the last platformer minigame. Platformer games aren't my cup of tea but I didn't find these platformer minigames frustrating. It did take me a few tries to get the last two right but that's to be expected and part of the fun, as otherwise it would mean the minigames are way too easy.Graphics and soundThe graphics are pixel graphics. Generally speaking, I'm not a big fan of pixel graphics butTick Tock Isle's graphics are relatively easy on the eye.The music is typical retro-style music that goes perfectly with the pixel graphics, and actually sounds pretty good. It reminded me of the high-end 16-bit console games of the 1990s.The sound effects are also basic and retro-style. When a character starts talking, you hear a sound effect that sounds like the character speaks one random syllable. So there's no voice acting but this minute detail does offer a taste of the tone of the characters' voices, which adds a lot of atmosphere.On Steam's extra featuresTick Tock Islehas no Steam Achievements. It does have 10 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 5 while running the game."

Other than that, had no issues with the game.Really quarky endearing game that deserves your attention."
,Recommended,418440,25136143,"Posted: 25 August, 2016",all,Audish,"Some adventure games are light on the gameplay in favor of going hard on the adventure. Tick Tock Isle is an interesting case because it goes light on both the gameplay AND the adventure. That might not sound too appealing, but the whimsical, off-beat story really works to bring this one together.You play a young Tintin-looking fellow by the ridiculous name of Strike Mainspring, called out to a remote island to fix a busted clock. Ascending the one towering building on the isle, you encounter a time machine that sends you back to the heady year 2009, when the island was still inhabited by its eclectic cast. Your adventure, then, is to repair the time machine and get back to where you belong.Accomplishing this is going to take a lot of running around, opening doors, picking up stuff, and talking to people. The family that resides on the island includes an elderly couple at imaginary war, a workaholic wife and her useless husband, a firey seductress, and a luchador. They each have their problems that you can help address, and often must help with to progress. The dialog is plenty charming between you and the strange players, though it's all kooky and irreverent without a lot of depth.As for the rest, it's as simple as can be. The controls are left and right to scoot around, up to jump, and down to interact. Enter opens your notebook with your inventory, map, and to do list. The map isn't terribly important as the game world is quite small, just a circuit around the island and a bunch of interconnected rooms in the building that you'll get used to soon enough. Your inventory is more helpful, with a slot for every item in the game, an indication of when it's been used, and a cutesy description that hints at its purpose.That's the game, running around fixing crazy people problems, scooping up items, and using them where they need to be used. I can't really say there's much in the way of puzzles, because items are used automatically when interacting with a point of interest. That means you can solve just about every puzzle by picking up an item and trying all the interaction points, which can also mean a lot of backtracking. There are a few brief platforming interludes but they're very much the exception and not at all challenging. The time travel theme at least is used to great effect, I won't spoil how but it gives a hint of cleverness to the simplistic puzzles.Once you grok the layout of the island and start digging into the tasks at hand, you'll be able to speed through the game in about an hour. That's not long, but it's an hour full of charm and levity. The excellent pixel graphics help keep things interesting, and the sound design fits the atmosphere well all the way to the adorable ending. You won't find much depth or story here, but Tick Tock Isle was a short and sweet experience that kept a smile on my face the whole time.Did you enjoy this review? I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope you'll check out more of them athttps://goldplatedgames.com/or on mycuration page!"

It's a short game, but I wouldn't consider that to be a bad thing since it's very well put together. The pixel art is gorgeous, and the music is excellent giving this little adorable island the perfect atmosphere. It is not at all a frustrating game either, just pure relaxing fun!I really hope they release the soundtrack as either a stand-alone album somewhere or here on Steam as a bundle or a separate 'DLC' so-to-speak.If you have any interest in adventure/puzzle games, or just time travel stories in general, then I highly recommend this one!

It's a time travel based game where you have to interact with the characters and environment to change the future.  The game itself has a cute style, and I only wished the game was a bit longer!  I was able to complete it in just an hour or so.A few things I felt could be improved upon:The map was a bit confusing, and a lot of the time spent in the game was actually me getting lost and trying to figure out how to get to a certain room.  While there was a map, it wasn't particularly useful.Certain interactions that are needed in order to further the game are a little random.  While some of the puzzles made sense, at times, some changes in the past or future didn't make much sense, which was a little frustrating.Overall, though, considering the price for the game, I certainly think it's worth to pick up!"

The artwork and character designs are very nice and the animations are well done. The characters you'll be interacting with and learning about are charming and their dialogue is littered with wit and humour. It's an heartwarming tale and kept me fully engaged.My complaints are only very minor. The title screen has a button to adjust the size of the game window and I had to fool with this multiple times each time I started the game to get it to be full screen. Tick Tock Isle is controlled using solely the arrow keys and it would have been nice to remind controls or be able to use the mouse. Lastly, the platforming sections were quite dull and I did not feel they added much to the game.As I said, these are very minor complaints in an otherwise heartwarming and thoroughly enjoyable game that is well worth your time."

It has charming music, characters and graphics. I personally really love the colors in this game, it gives it the right touch of bright and bouncy. The music is also amazing, I love every single track, and if the OST was for sale I'd buy it in a heartbeat.I have conflicting feelings on the game's length, clocking inshameless clock jokeat an hour and a half. The length fits this game well, you're able to absorb the the quirk and fun without being tired of the game. But I wish there was more. I want to know more about this world and about these characters. There are a lot of questions I have about what happened pregame. I'm also just a sucker for world building... Though these unanswered questions don't take away from the game at all.This game is built on multiple play throughs, as there are many sidequests and items you can find to help you along your very short, very silly adventure, so if you enjoy a game you can play more then once then this game is probably up your ally.for $2.99 you're getting way more then your money's worth9/10 Would take up arms against the Squid King again."

But, it's a small aspect)*Fixed window mode(It's better to play in window mode since all the graphics are sharper and nothing is cut off at the edges. But, when attempting full-screen by pressing Alt+Enter, the graphics were a bit blurry and at least the main menu was out of focus)*Continuity itch(It's a sweet, short, standalone game. But, there are a few aspects left unexplained, and it's such an enjoyable setting that I'd be very open to playing future entries if the developers decide to turn it into a series. Some may feel that 'continuity itch' in the end.)~.~.~.~.~.~.I really enjoyed the colorful pixel art (Unlike some other indie games, the colors aren't too bright or loud, they're very even), the relaxing soundtrack (flutes in an island setting, along with telltale tick-tock sounds are very fitting), and the endearing characters - each with their own personality and brief backstory - that change over time the more you interact with them in the hopes of improving their futures.In a way, I guess it could be compared to classic adventure games like Monkey Island meets Back To The Future, it was a delightful and fun experience!I'm actually a little saddened that it wasn't a little longer, because I wanted to keep exploring and know more about the characters - especially Strike, our time traveler, I'd like to know more about him and his world.Overall, it's a charming game and it's priced at an incredible bargain, it's a win-win!"

,Recommended,418440,34131663,Posted: 9 August,all,FirstHour,"Cute game that is just the right length for what it offers. Gameplay is pretty basic: explore an island with a big house on it and look for items to collect and people to use those items on to solve their problems. The time travel aspect gives the game a neat premise that is delivered on in the <2 hours it takes to complete. My biggest complaint is that there is quite a bit of repeated and sometime tedious exploration needed to find the right item or event to trigger the story to move on. On the other hand, there are a few action segments that break this tedium up quite nicely. I will note that when you first explore the house it can seem confusing, but if you pause and look at the map it will help you imagine the layout much better. Otherwise it feels like you're moving through a 3D space in 2D quite strangely."

I highly recommend it if you enjoy pixel art, which the game tackles beautifully, and simple puzzles. The music, while not particularly memorable, is also handled very well; I played this game on a lazy Saturday afternoon and it was so incredibly relaxing to explore the clock tower, sipping coffee and listening to the calming melodies.The game is, of course, very short, so this game may not be the best for those who would rather sink their teeth into meaty adventures. Mileage will vary slightly, but if you plow through everything at once, Tick Tock Isle will more than likely take you around an hour to complete. Despite the short play time, though, the characters leave an impression. They're all facing problems that are in many way familiar, yet these problems are expressed and/or solved in unique ways. The family musician, Melody is uninspired; Rod and his wife clash over his laziness; Rivet and Brazo, two other residents, lament their lack of skill in certain areas. Solving their problems are satisfying and the conclusion of the game, if somewhat abrupt, feels earned.Some other quick notes:1) It was lovely to see small references to other time travel-based stories in the game; I'll leave the matter of what's actually referenced a surprise, though.2) There's at least one secret/easter egg that I managed to catch on my game, which added an interesting little tidbit to the backstory (keep an eye out, near the very end of the game, of an area to use the cheese). And based on one item I ended up not using, I think that there could be at least one more. Just something of interest to mention for the completionists out there."

Getting through the house and island can be repetitive at times, but the mini level games are really cute and fun to play.Play this if you want some short and simple fun to while away the time."

Exploring can be a little annoying as navigating around the house can be a little confusing at first.There are some items that you collect along the way that isn't necessary to complete the game so if you are slightly OCD and need to finish things perfectly, take your time and search around properly. In saying so, even if you don't complete your inventory the first time, you can speed run through the second time and complete it within couple of hours :)"

The story is fun with lots of little jokes interlaced through it, fun puzzling and fantastic vibe to it. Loved the art style.The only negative thing I could say about it is that the Esc key closes the game or exits automatically so a menu screen would have been nice instead but it isn't a game breaking level problem. Just not what I prefer. Still, I enjoyed it a lot for the 1 and a half hours it took to finish it, really a very nice little game and you can't argue with a 0.99c price."

76561198155176136,Recommended,418440,31552163,Posted: 4 May,all,alissa618,Pop culture nostalgia at its best. This is a wonderful short game that will make an evening incredibly enjoyable and remind you of the days when SNES was out. It's an adventure game that's easy to pick up and a lot of fun. Plus the music is wonderful. You can tell this was made with love and all the subtle pop culture references were icing on the cake.

The story, characters, and puzzles lack substance. I'm giving a thumbs up as I want to encourage Squiddershins to go much further in their next game. On the surface, there's talent here. If you can and want to - dig deeper, dev."

,Recommended,418440,34140479,Posted: 9 August,all,SaibaX <Earth Dimension C-137>,"To start off, I bought this game for just under $1USD. Very much so worth it.First off, you start the game leaving a boat on your way to fix a clock tower, after fixing the clock the game really begins. Now normally I would complain about a game whos objectives require you to run some ways back and forth to accomplish a goal, but this game does it in an interesting way. You do have to figure out what goes where and where to find things but everything changes as you progress through the game between the years 2009 and 2010. This simple mechanic makes the fetching and searching exciting as you observe all of the changes both big and small.The 8-bit art style for this game is very fun to look at and are only a quarter of the charm. Each character has it's own personality, from the Elderly couple at metaphorical war with eachother to lovely woman in red who is absolutely infatuated with an accomplished luchadore. All of the pieces fit together in the best possible way in my own oppinion.The control scheme for this game is very simple but also awkward.Enter = InventoryArrow Keys:Left + Right = MoveUp = JumpDown = Context ActionThough this game is very small and not meant to have a complex control scheme I think future games should include at least 2 control scheme options:WASDFandUp, Down, Left, Right, EnterIt's not a complaint by any means, just a suggestion for future endeavers by this studio with these types of games.Overall, I would recommend this game any time of day for people looking for a short, charming game that's hard to put down till the end."

It lasted about 3 hours (probably could be done faster if you realise what needs to be done or realise that there's a MAP OF THE HOUSE... T_T ), but they were very enjoyable 3 hours. The graphics are super cute and the music is nice. The story is excellent and super funny too!"
