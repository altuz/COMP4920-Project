,Recommended,418520,29290750,Posted: 15 January,all,Alas I Cannot Swim,"I actually like this better than TiltBrush. In SculptrVR you can build a castle the size of yourself and then shrink down and explore it and build the details. I spent an hour making a little fort on the side of a cliff with trenches and underground passageways, chiseling out tunnels and building walls Minecraft-style with the block tool.And yes, the hang glider is as fun as it looks. The game comes pre-packaged with tons of huge destructible maps, and one of them is a massive tree structure. You can shrink down to ant-size and and hang glide between the leaves, each of which is as big as a church.Playing 3D Pictionary is a lot of fun, too.EDIT: I just realized you can export builds as a .obj file, which meansyou can 3D print the sculptures you make.That's freaking incredible."
76561198020764073,Recommended,418520,22367736,"Posted: 11 April, 2016",all,Derino,"As far as I can tell, SculptrVR is the first of its kind in that people can use it to build at vastly differing scales. I've dreamed of an app like this for a while now, so it's not surprising that it kept me busy for several hours. However, in case the developer is open for suggestions, there are a couple of things that can be addressed:There aren't very many options for tools; just sphere, cube, rocket, spraycan, and this one projectile-orb thing that I can't get to work (plus their eraser equivalents). I could think of a few tool ideas right off the bat that would certainly make building things faster (straight-line box fill, rectangular-prismic box fill, resolution of boxes in drawing spheres, cut/copy/paste, recolor, sunlight direction, bezier curve box fill, etc).Also, there are only 16 possible colors for boxes, all of which appear to have the same color scheme as wool blocks in Minecraft. This is really one of my lesser complaints; I can understand if 16 colors is for memory-saving purposes, because I can tell the program was made with space-saving in mind. (I'm going to take a wild guess and say that every heterogeneous block is defined by eight smaller blocks, some of which might recursively consist of eight even-smaller blocks and so on.) Despite this, a color palette that allows users to decide which 16 colors are used would be nice.Because this program is so new, I'll excuse these minor issues and say that I recommend this game, because let's be honest: creating worlds of vastly differing scales is an awesome and undervisited idea. I see so much potential as to what SculptrVR could become; in particular, I'm excited to see what you mean when you say ""Game inside the scupted worlds"" on the list of things that are coming soon.Edit: I'm not very good at actually writing reviews, so my bad if this was a little unfair-sounding."

Nothing else in VR lets you scale yourself down to the size of a bug all the way to a size of a mountain, with just the swiping of the thumb. Creating huge worlds is incredibly easy, intuitive, and satisfying. Very hard to describe, but even a non-artist like myself can space out in this insanely awesome app. Can't recommend it enough. I bought this when the vive first came out, and thought it was cool, but I had so many other things I wanted to try in vr. Four months later and I'm playing this more than nearly all my other 80+ apps. And with multiplayer, the awesomeness of this only multiplies...    imagine doing insane creations with your friends.  This is just incredible."
,Recommended,418520,29687462,Posted: 4 February,all,timawesomeness,"Super cool, but desperately needs an in-game tutorial. You have to figure out all the controls by yourself, which is not the easiest.New update completely fixes my issues with that.Super cools, controls are now fairly intuitive, and performance is improved significantly from previous versions."
76561198304997871,Recommended,418520,23480210,"Posted: 9 June, 2016",all,refsland,"So far this has the best combination of Modbox and Google Tilt design software I've used. As an artist, architect and UX designer, this one has the best blend of pure art design and standard architectural blocks akin to building in a VR LegoWorld. While the tools are extremely simple at the moment, the author's logic structure is the best so far I've seen, making it super fast to create whatever project I'm working on. I'm guessing with time this tool is only going to get better, but for the first iteration, if you're looking for something like a fast 3D conceptual tool, this is the one. Enjoy."

It has a completely different feel.As others have already pointed out, there are a number of things that could be improved.-more variation in color palette-undo/redo-ability to clone a segment and replicate it anywhere-ability to position avatar anywhere in space ( a temporary ramp could be created underneath to make it feel less strange)-a way to smooth an edge-additional brushes (or create custom brushes)-I could go on (this only speaks to the fact that this is so good)Honestly though, this is already amazing as it is. It is amongst the top VR experiences at the moment."

Tilt-brush's painting style mostly only works to draw 2d stuff in a 3d world, while this one is definitely 3d-driven. It still has several features that I would like to have (more than 16 colors is a huge one for me right now), but it is definitely really nice already. Would definitely recommend."

I really want to try some Multiplayer. Judging from so few reviews i dont think may people are on. I guess it still early days. Excited for the new tools coming and copy / paste will be neat. I notice the grip buttons dont seem to be used yet.I did notice some rendering issues, blue / pink over lays with different sampling modes, shadows However they go away depending on setting."

I have used a few other voxel based games/software over the years just for being creative in and this is by far my favorite so far. Makes quick work for alot of stuff being able to scale up and down which is where it excells over others. In others you can spend ages trying to make some big if you are stuck at same size but in this you just scale up create it in next to no time roughly and scale down to add details. This is a fantastic feature as you can scale down extremely small to add those hard to get to details. For alot of art and creative stuff, its the details that count so how this gives you the option to add as much detail as you want ....i can see some awesome creative screenshots and installations getting posted on the community page once people really start using it to its potential.  I've only had this for 2 days and already put nearly 17 hours in. So far i have'nt even tried importing any objects which i see others have. So huge options available.Pros: Almost too many to list.VRBeing able to scale up and downEditable Avatars is funCons:  Ummm be prepared to live in VR and lose days of your life.... altho its quite worth it.Ideas:   Maybe a palette of textures like wood, stone, grass, gravel, etc to add to give an even more real look to objects you create.Top marks to the developers of this. Its great fun and loads of potential. Worth every cent. Stop reading this and go get it if you dont have it and are a creative person. :)"
,Recommended,418520,24211570,"Posted: 9 July, 2016",all,Polecat Von Einzbern,"I would highly recommend this as a VR experience for anyone with some spare change lying around. The price is a bit steep for how basic it is (that seems to plague 90% of VR games) but the feeling of becoming a giant, making a structure, going down to normal scale, and walking on the thing you just made is amazing. This game gives you such an excellent sense of scale.If you've got money and are looking for fun VR experiences, go for this.If you're on a tight budget and looking for the most bang for your buck, I would hold out until a sale, especially since you probably already own Tilt Brush."

Grow into a giant to sculpt the big picture, shrink down to work on the fine details, then become a giant again to admire your work.Multiplayer is a bit confusing to get started, but worth persisting with."
,Recommended,418520,22781798,"Posted: 3 May, 2016",all,Killa_Kyle,"I like the game so far. Being able to build at multiple sizes and scale yourself is amazing.A few suggestions to improve it:- Expanded color palette- Undo / redo shortcuts (tiltbrush does this with a left click on the trackpad- Visual indicator of scale (sometimes it's hard to know what size I was at when making something)- Block snap, at certain block size / scale combos the snapping is more of a hinderance than a help when it doesn't line up.Looking forward to seeing future improvements"

,Recommended,418520,34672764,Posted: 1 September,all,Ax23000,"I've looked at this off and on for a while now, but only recently pulled the trigger after buying the daydream version on sale. After playing around with that I discovered that it supports cross-platform multiplayer, which meant that my daughter and I could play at the same time in the same world (one of us wearing daydream and the other the Vive). We've had a ton of fun throwing rockets at one another, playing ball, destroying everything in sight around one another, and changing scale so that one of us becomes a giant and another a mouse.When I play by myself I've found this to be a more powerful and easy to use creation tool than I expected. Right now I'm working on a house for my daughter. I love how I can change scale on the fly to make tiny details (like a bee on the rose bush under the window, or a birds nest inside the trunk of a tree). I really love creating things in VR, there's something incredibly satisfying about it and this game scratches that itch perfectly."

The ability to resize the user up and down is unique to SculptrVR and a must-have VR experience.

,Recommended,418520,26325558,"Posted: 30 October, 2016",all,Norgus,"First off, this is beautifully fast to get stuck into. The single player experience gives you a lot of space to play with, and it's fun to scale yourself up, built some mega-structure, then scale back down and add rooms to it, external detail, inner mazes or whatever!The copy-paste tool is great if you made something the wrong size, too, because you can make a copy, then scale the copy (and/or yourself) before pasting it back larger/smaller.The multiplayer seems to work okay in that it functions well, but there is a crying lack of proper communication between players (we need voice chat like in RecRoom!) and so the main method of communication degrades into destructive ""griefing"" activities (overwriting work, flinging rockets everywhere, etc).The game isn't ""early access"" but is in active development as best I can tell, so the game has my recommendation for a great singleplayer and hopes for the future RE multiplayer."

I still recommend it because it's really fun.PROS:- very fun to voxel sculpt with it.- fantastic that you can scale yourself up to the size of a giant, or down to an ant.- performs very well (no lag or anything).- can make good looking stuff without a lot of skill.CONS:- the controls are awkward to use.- tool options are lacking.- can't scale the world while you stand still (must teleport and scale yourself)- can't get rid of the basket ball if you click it by accident."
,Recommended,418520,33298778,Posted: 5 July,all,The Foot In His Mouth,"For what is there, it's very enjoyable. A couple of things I'd love to see: Easier scaling, in real time if possible, possibly using the grip buttons, and I'd like a Jetpack. The glider is cool, but if you fall it becomes a great pain the♥♥♥♥♥to get back to where you were high up without making yourself huge. A grappling hook would be nice too. And maybe Climbey-esque controls? I hate comparing everything to Climbey regarding locomotion, but they really do it well, and being able to climb the 400 foot tall phallus I just sculpted sounds hilariously fun. :D"
,Recommended,418520,32923937,Posted: 28 June,all,Zii'lyeh,"Most intuitive sculpting app so far for me, interface is a bit fiddly at first, but is generally well thought out. Allows for both additive and subtractive sculpting and scales to just about any size, symmetry features have also recently been added. The aesthetic is a block style similar to Minecraft or it's many clones, so no easy angled blocks (yet).There are multiple locomotion modes, so if you don't feel like port-port-porting around you can test your motion sickness tolerance with the (rather neat) Cubeworld style hang glider...Performance wise I haven't hit any issues on the demos or with my own crude structures, so even using something like the GTX970 you should be able to pump up the supersampling a little. More CPU and RAM bound than GPU.Essentially (early) minecraft creative mode in VR and with an interface designed for touch controllers. Excellent for playing around and building as well as breaking the ice for new VR users. Gameplay is nonexistent outside of creating, but it is called SculptrVR after all.One minor request would be the ability to load up a reference image of some kind, a scalable floating window with a one button file browser would be nice. Switching to Desktop mode to look at these things does break the flow a bit."
