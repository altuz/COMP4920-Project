It has these locations where the height of your jump is slightly too much but you don't expect that, so first you mess up, go back to a checkpoint, and next time you have to remember to jump in a weird way so you go right when you start falling. And that has to be well timed, too. Almost everything is based on perfect positioning but the way the ""character"" controls really sucks. Oh and sometimes you get stuck in the ground.This all happened to me on the first level. I gave up.★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆"

I'm using this space to update my review based on those changes. Original review is down below.They have implemented WASD controls and have now made wall jumping a tad easier. This makes playing the game more comfortable and with the improvements to wall jumping less frustrating.Fixed the music abruptly stopping after death. You can now finally hear the chill music track and I dig it.They've implemented a level counter. A small change but it's nice to know you've completed a level.Small introductions to new mechanics. Base game had no tips, more info about new mechanics is always welcome.Updated score 7/10.------------------------------------------------Original review:Pros:Price is on point - For such a simple game I feel they nailed the price point perfectly. If you enjoy challenging platformers, I feel you can get your £0.79 worth.It's challenging - Not a surprise there! If you're like me and like a quick challenge there's something in here for you.Simplicity - You're a square avoiding death, it doesn't over complicate things, it knows what it is and sticks to it.25 levels - 25 doesn't seem like a lot but having spent an hour on just 6 levels I feel there's easily enough content.Devs listen - They're very open to feedback and have proven to change the game based on said feedback. Fantastic to see!Cons:(Fixed as of 27/01/2016) - 1 Music track - Swiftly fails hard on the music front. I would like to say I've heard the whole track however when you die (And you will die a lot) the music instantly stops and starts from the beginning. Within just 9 minutes I hate to mute the game entirely and put on my own music! Extremely frustrating to listen to.(Improved as of 27/01/2016) - Controls - For the most part the controls are fine, so why is this in the cons section? Wall jumping. Yup. Wall jumping. Wall jumping is the most infuriating part of this game, it's not challenging, it's not fun, it's a wrestle with the controls and it sucks!Improvements:(Fixed as of 27/01/2016) - Don't restart music upon death, let that little sucker continue playing! The addition of 2 or 3 more music tracks would be extremely welcome.(Improved as of 27/01/2016) - Re-work wall jumping! I can't even put down in words how frustrating it is to mash up & left then quickly let go to mash up and right in the hopes it's timed correctly to achieve a wall jump. Make is so your square can stick to the walls for easier jumping or rework the whole wall jumping together!Achievements don't pop at the end of levels - They only pop once you go back to the menu.(Implemented as of 27/01/2016) - Add a level notification, I had no idea I had completed 5 levels till I exited to the menu. Once the player has moved to a new level and quick flash of level [number] would be welcomed.Simple leaderboads - Just to add a tiny bit of competitiveness to the game. Add a simple leaderboard of the top 10 fastest finishes. It's simple and could spur somebody on to beat that No.1 - adding a small amount of replay-ability.Conlusion:If you like quick, fun, challening levels I see no reason why you shouldn't pick this up. The game needs improvements there's no doubt about that. However, what we have now is still an enjoyable game despite some flaws. Overall I give Swiftly 6/10."

But this game just doesn't play well at all.  I couldn't figure out what the hitboxes of the wheels were, making the game not just hard, but also annoying.  It wouldn't have been bad if I could have set my own controls.  Using the arrow keys to move is meh, I prefer AWSD, but using the up arrow to jump just makes this game unplayable.  Also the physics are st00pid.Unfortunately I can't recommend the game, despite the low price.  Save your pennies, folks!UPDATE:  So I was contacted to change my review in light of recent changes that have been made by the developer.One thing I can give credit for is that the developer seems to care about constructive criticism and wants to improve upon what he has made and has as such implemented AWSD controls after my review.  Jumping however, is still a pain as I'd rather have a dedicated button that isn't part of my control pad.  Music doesn't restart upon death anymore, fortunately removing another layer of obnoxiousness.  Hitboxes are still eh.A small thing I forgot to mention in my first review was how the first checkpoint was stupid, because you need a run-up to do the next gauntlet, meaning you have to track back a little every time you die.  This doesn't make the game hard, just annoying.All in all, I'd say that maybe I was too harsh at first and the game is just unfinished and needs some polish.  This game does have potential to be functional, and I'm sure the developer can do it!"

You have to dodge all the spiked gears and use 3 different colored platforms (green = jump, red = slide, blue = walljump). The jump mechanics are quite evil, also the leveldesign which let's you die instantly at your spawnpoint. At least you can barely control your square at flight. Another mean element not to be underestimated is the deadly ceiling. But after get used to it you can even skip many gears by jump over them with full throttle or use the checkpoints that are spreaded in the levels. Some quality issues forced the dev to remove the achievement for the last level (level25) and also the lately added timer seems pretty broken. But if you want to get entertained for a few hours and enjoy raging moments this game is good. Also the neverending soundtrack loop is supportive to your raised heartbeat."
,Not Recommended,418610,28873971,"Posted: 31 December, 2016",all,yzuniversal,"Swiftlytells an exciting story with a deep message and a surprising twist at the end: you buy a game for 0.49€, and it turns out to not be good.It's not as obvious as it might seem, though. I gotSuper Meat Boyfor 0.69€ and it has since become a proof to me that ""cheap"" doesn't have to mean ""bad"". Even ifSMB's case remains an exception more than a rule, I refuse to treat uncostly games any differently from all the other ones. I expect, at worst, a fun distraction that lasts way too short, or something of this sort.Swiftly, in any case, is a non-descript, generic game in the hardcore-platformer-with-minimalist-aesthetics genre. It has no story, worldbuilding or joke to it. What you see on the screenshots — black square, spiky wheels etc. — is all you get. It's super basic, and nothing changes during the game either; no new mechanic appears, even the background and the music remain the same throughout. (In fact, the single music track is looped, and there are no other sounds.)If there's one distinctive element toSwiftly— and maybe the one thing that could have saved it somehow — it's the focus on physics. I should, however, put ""focus"" in quotes here because it really only is lip service. While the game makes the notions of having some very physics-y stuff in it (e.g. you ""add force"" by pressing move buttons, according to the help text), there isn't any actually to be found. What's more, you shouldn't even expect the most basic physics to behave correctly. Some of the things that happened to me when playing Swiftly:I strafed in the air.I jumped in the air. But I think it only works when you're falling.I jumped in the air when hitting a bouncy platform and got rocketed into the sky.I also got sent into the sky because I moved between two different-colored segments on a platform.I got stuck to the ground.I got locked in between two blocks with no way to restart from a checkpoint. (In fact, there is no pause menu; you just exit to the main one.)And many, many more surprising situations. Or, as one might call them, bugs.To make things better, the game explicitly includes wall jumping which I guess was added just 'cause it's cool — so much for the ""scientific approach"".For what it's worth,Swiftlyis relatively challenging, so at least one of its claims is true. (Although maybe I should say, relatively unchallenging, since while it was somewhat hard at certain points, the game doesn't come close to the difficulty ofVVVVVVorSMB, or many other titles.) At least it is short, so you won't suffer too much if you do buy it (took me 2.8 hours to beat). I can't recommend getting it, though."

Personally all this game really needs is better indicators around the spikes because it doesnt look the spkies are killing you, its more of the air around the spikes. for the dallor i spent on it, it was totally worth."

The game in itself is simple, navigate a black box to the finish without touching the black saws and across three different kinds of platforms (green=bouncy, red=slippery/no friction, and blue=solid/has friction).The game isn't just a physics game, but also a puzzler which is what I think frustrates a lot of people. And sometimes you might need a little dose of luck to get past a level.I can say, personally, that I though about giving up probably about ever 4 levels because I thought I couldn't beat them. But the more I played, the better I got and eventually I would beat the game and have all the achievements. If you want a  good challenge this is most definitely worth it.Pros:+Very Challenging+Fun+Different levels focus on different styles (i.e. one might be wall jumps, another hopping saws, etc)+You get bragging rights (trust me, you'll understand at the very end)Cons:-Some checkpoints are not in very good locations (i.e level 22....that level, omg)Overall, I rate it a 9.75/10"

This is even more annoying when how you speed up and slow down is awkward and clunky. The hitbox's are also poorly designed and fustrating. There are many times you think you'll not get hit, but you end up getting hit anyway.The jump button isn't mapped to its own button seperate for movement, so it gets awkward trying to get the right jump. Speaking of jump, it's always the same height, so it becomes stupidly difficult to get through some tight spaces, add the dumb hitbox's to that and...yeah.It also gets stale level design as for all the jumps feel similar. Checkpoints are poorly placed and take forever to get to. Add in the blind jumps and yeah, there goes your happiness.The music is forgettable, and there is only 1 soundtrack so...it gets annoying eventually.Never got to the wall-jumping, which according to other reviews is even worse than the above.I can't recommend this game.

Swiftly certainly is a cheap platformer, but even for £0.79 it was not worth it.A note to artists - there is a difference between ""minimalist"" and ""dull"".  This game is very dull to look at (and that's on the best graphics preset out of the six available so I don't really want to think about the lower ones).  You control a grey square as you make your way through levels consisting of blue, green and red rectangles and spinning spiked wheels...and that's pretty much it.  There is no variety there, either in terms of levels feeling different from each other or in terms of hazards.  The spiky wheels don't even move around at all.Each different colour of platform has different properties - blue ones are ""normal"", green ones bounce you higher as you jump on them and red ones are basically frictionless like video game ice (personally if I was designing a game like this I would've made the blue platforms the frictionless ones to conform to the ice=no friction thing that most games do, but that's a minor point).  These are the only surfaces you have in the game, with the hazards being the aforementioned spiky wheels along with the bottom and top edges of the screen.  That means that there are only so many different variations on obstacles to get past.  This is one of those games where 25 levels feels simultaneously like too few and too many.It's not much better when it comes to the sound, either.  As far as I can tell there are only 2 music tracks in the game - one for the menus and one for everything else.  They aren't even particularly catchy tracks (then again, hearing the same music over and over for that long is pretty bad, anyway).  There are also no sound effects whatsoever - not even a little victory fanfare for beating a level or the game as a whole.  I think that's a pretty major downside of the experience as it results in a lack of audiovisual feedback.  Frequently I have fallen into a pit or run into spikes because there's no easy way to tell how fast you're going; you can't judge this based on noise, because there isn't any, or on visuals because the backgrounds are so indistinct.Gameplay is very basic.  Functional, for the most part, but it doesn't feel very nice to control, again partly due to the lack of audiovisual feedback.  Also some of the spawn points are placed directly over a pit or a spiked wheel, which is in my opinion the sort of thing you see in those ""Kaizo"" romhacks that used to be popular.  It doesn't make things harder - only more annoying.I'm also impressed by how buggy the game seems to be despite being so simple.  The level timer seems to only record the time for the first level you play and then just freezes when you go to the next one without resetting or tracking time across multiple levels.  It only seems to reset when you exit a level back to the main menu.  This timer seems to be pretty pointless anyway as the game doesn't appear to save your time for each level, nor do any of the achievements seem to make use of it.The walljump mechanics are also some of the worst I've ever experienced as sometimes when trying to jump away from the wall, your...character, for lack of a better word...just goes straight up, completely robbed of any sideways momentum (admittedly it's very possible I'm just bad at it, but when this happens the square doesn't gain any sideways momentum no matter how hard I press the button - unlike, say, falling off a ledge for example).  According to some of the reviews I read before deciding to try the game, they actually used to be even worse than this.  I would hate to see that.Also sometimes when you attempt to move to a green platform directly after a blue one, the square will just stop stuck at the edge they share, even when there's no visible gap or bump in the terrain.Finally despite how basic the game looks, I occasionly found the game frame-stuttering which didn't help when I needed to input a direction at a prescise moment.There is trading card support, if you're into that.  I honestly think that these are the dullest-looking cards for any game that I have ever played on Steam.  One of them is literally the grey square you control in-game in front of an off-white background.  So a grey square on a flat colour.  Obviously a lot of people who care about the trading cards don't actually care about what's on them, but come on.I beat the game in under two hours and have basically no desire to go back to it at present.  I simply can't recommend this game, unfortunately."
