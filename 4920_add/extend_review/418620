76561198040837514,Recommended,418620,20956350,"Posted: 4 February, 2016",all,Brudda,"If you love beat-em-ups, nothing much more to say except that this game is a must have.The gameplay is pretty similar to the 90's beat em up game, I'm sure ya'll know which one I'm talking about.  You have your standard punch and kick combos, these can be mixed up a bit to perform a varied combo with a different visual effect; although very limited at the moment.  You also have jump kicks and punches, but there are not special ones as of now.  Then you have your specials where the character does a spinning punch or throws a fireball.  Lastly you have your standard grab and throw moves.On thing that is unique though is that you can pull out your pistol and shoot enemies, which I thought is a nice touch.  Ammo is not unlimited, you have to find them in crates throughout the level.I feel that the combat is fairly solid, nothing fancy, just go up to the enemy and beat the crap out of them.  I do have to say though that the character animations seem a bit stiff when performing the attacks.  Some work can be done to make the attacks look more fluid.Currently there is only one stage in campaign mode which takes about 10 minutes to beat, but you also have a survival mode with two different stages.  I feel survival mode is another thing which makes this game unique, it isn't too often you find a beat em up that has a stage solely for the purpose of beating up enemies util you're satisfied.  The way it is set up now is enemies will continuosly spawn and attack.  You are free to move back and forth within the level, which is semi big.  Scattered throughout the arena are ammo and health crates which are very limited.  The score is based off of how many enemies you defeated.Pricing as of now, 2/4/16, is $4.99 which is very fair.  There isn't much content, but it has a solid foundation to work on.  The only thing that makes the game justifiable at this price is thesurvival mode, without it I would have waited for more updates before purchasing.Also which I feel is important to note, as of now there is NO online multiplayer and NO local co-op, only singleplayer.  This may change in the future.  I know this is a dealbreaker for some players, so I would wait and see if these options will be implemented or not.Remember this is an Early Access game, so there will be bugs and glitches.  Overall though I see a lot of potential in this game to be a really awesome beat-em-up and I highly recommend purchasing this game and watch it grow.I will be updating this review as time goes on :D ."

Attacking enemies feels great, the art is quite good, and the character design is really solid.There is also a steep difficulty curve, but it can be overcome with practice, which is nice change of pace. I'm extremely interested to see how this project evolves and can't wait for more updates in the future."

It's the souped-up version.  There are a few problems.  1) moving up and down on the screen is realitly slow.  2) maybe the worst, is the attack-hit-line could be a little wider.  Sometimes, they are right in front of you and your attacks won't hit because you aren't 100% lined up.  2b)  they can hit you sometime, but you can't hit them.  Their attack-line seems to be a little wider.  3) when you grab sometimes there is a delay when you throw enemies.  Two and three can be irrating when the battles get a little tougher.  Final Note:  This is the early release version.  Even if they don't fix these problems its still a great game.  Fix those problem and it could be one of the best, especially if your an old fogey, and a fan of old.

This game is amazing for fans of the beat ups, not sure why developers don't make more games like this, anyway, I think the game plays well and would recommend it to people who enjoy this kind of game, it has all the feel of a classic with extra flare. I really like the music and the interactive backgrounds it's a nice twist. controls are great too. Fourth and fifth characters wouldn't go a miss, maybe a younger character, Skate type and another girl preferably blonde ha.

It really does capture the vibe of the Streets of Rage series, to the point it might as well be the long-delayed SOR 4...if it wasn't supposed to be in the first place. Graphics are splendid, a really great mesh of pre-rendered high-deph sprites and terrific 3D backgrounds (which worked without a hitch on my rig), the music is cool, and, most importantly, the gameplay is spot on! I would only add a sprint button, and maybe add a sidestep/roll as SOR 3 had to go up and down. Still, can't wait to see more of it and look forward to getting the full game!"

,Recommended,418620,28785309,"Posted: 29 December, 2016",all,Scoot,"Want Streets of Rage? Here's Streets of Rage. It's almost Streets of Rage. Game is very much in early access as of this review, but the game gets its point across well enough even at this stage. It's exactly what I was looking for.Combo system is interesting, as instead of a basic Attack, Special, Jump kind of deal like SoR, it's got a kick and punch button. They both have about the same use, but you can mix them up for different crowd control and such. No melee weapons so far as I can tell, (I've gotten to stage 4) but you DO have a handgun that you find ammo for in boxes among apples for health recovery. The handgun is really handy too for picking those guys you jump kicked off the screen... again. A very welcome tweak.Graphics are nice. They're kind of gritty, and remind me of old school Mortal Kombat. Although those animations may need some cleaning up. They look pretty stilted. Some enemies don't even have walking animations!There's only two characters, and they seem pretty much the same save the (I think?) special attacks. I've always played Blaze in SoR for her speed and I love chaining suplexes like the jerk I am. So I hope that they either make the current female character play more like her, or just make another character for that.Game could use a lot more polish, but that's no surprise if you're picking it up at this stage. It's definitely (even as of now) a must-buy for my fellow niche beat'em up fans if you're burnt out on Streets of Rage Remake."

76561198054790890,Recommended,418620,21039153,"Posted: 7 February, 2016",all,SpeckofDust,"The TakeOver appears to be a well made Streets of Rage clone, and as you play it, you will see that it is almost a complete copy of SoR, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.The 3D background environments are impressive, as well as the character models.  The gameplay is pretty simplistic, and the main character is a near-identical update of the original ""Axel"" character from SoR2, down to most of the attack animations.  This is where The Takeover begins to differ a little.There are separate attack buttons for punch and kick, which allow for slight variation in attack combos.  I'm liking the gun mechanic.  You always have a pistol and can draw it at anytime, however it take multiple shots to take down an enemy, which makes it good for getting out of a tight spot without feeling like you can spam it to be invincible.The game appears to be VERY early access, but from what I've played so far, the graphics and character design put it a step above your average Early offerings."

My judgement of giving this game in its current state a thumbs down is solely based on the gameplay- the heart of any arcade-like game.Pros:- beautiful visuals- great audio- simple but entertaining combo system- varied and interesting movesets- unique feel to the charactersNeutral:- slow- blatant ripoffNegative:- horrible key configuration- custom key configuration utterly bugged making the game almost unplayable- common issues with gamepad inputs- sluggish controls/ gameflow- slow menu navigation- intro sequence way too long, boring and not skippable(- lives would be a welcomed addition)While the game appears to be impressive, actually playing it yourself is a less fun experience. It is vastly polished in all aspects except gameplay. And that is the problem. It plays poorly. That is also not an issue linked to it being in Early Access. It's about fundamentals that can be fixed in a day or two. More so, it should have been the main task to work on in the early stages. I find it irritating that the game gets new content continously, but lacks addressing several mayor issues.I am a very forgiving player, but The Takeover just lost focus on the most basic and most important aspects.Yes, this game is shamelessly plagiarized from Streets of Rage. Calling it inspired is a sugar coated understatement. But since it's done really good and because of my fondness of the source material, I don't mind.While coming from Streets of Rage 3, gameplay felt horribly slow. But after some time, I got used to the slower speed. I do prefer more fast paced Beat 'em ups, so I am a tad harsh in that matter. In all honesty, the speed in The Takeover is just alright and reminds of several classics. Criticising the speed would be just arguing about taste.Despite the obvious love for detail (that trash hopping around when smashing somebody into the ground <3), I had to stop playing because of the numerous gameplay issues. Inverted directional inputs on an XBOX 360 controller is indeed a mayor turn off, topped off by unpolished general gameplay.I can't recommend The Takeover in its current state. To change my mind, the developer needs to fix the fundamentals. That is something that should have been the mayor focus in the beginning. It's evident that the goal was to make it all flashy instead.Don't let this harsh criticism fool you- I am looking forward to future updates, since this is a nice start."

Updates come every 2 or 3 weeks and almost every one has content updates. It's well-polished in many respects and ends up being the brawler you remember with the visual and audible fidelity you've come to expect out of modern games.Though the game only contains four levels at the time of this writing and has some fit-and-finish bugs, it still comes highly recommended."
76561198040987276,Recommended,418620,21170149,"Posted: 12 February, 2016",all,scifidude79,"Right now, the game is basically a playable demo, as it is in Early Access.  But, if you love those old school beat 'em up games that were in all of the arcades in the '80s and '90s, you'll love this game.  It definitely has very much of a Streets of Rage feel to it, which cannot be a bad thing.  It's not a copy, though.Right now, the game consists of one stage with three parts, the last part being a boss fight.  After that, the game goes back to the title page.  Also, there's a survival mode where you can basically fight endless enemies in a gladiator type arena.  I didn't do so hot in that mode.  ;)  But, what is there so far of the main game is fantastic.  It's that old school 2.5D side scrolling action game us '80s (and probably '90s too) kids love.  Like in most of those games, you fight a select group of enemies in a part of the map, then you continue on to the next until you reach the end.  If you ""die"" along the way, you can restart the part you're on, you don't have to go back to the beginning, and retries are unlimited.  Or, at least, that's how it is in story mode.  There will eventually be an Arcade mode, and I'm thinking that may have limited lives, to really complete the old school arcade feel.  You have the usual basic moves of this type of game; jump, punch and kick.  Though, your character can also shoot fireballs from his hands, damaging a number of enemies.  Take care when using that, though, as it drains health.  And, you also have a pistol, but you have to find bullets for that.  The game play is fun and intense, just like you expect from this type of game.  The combat is tough, but not unfair.  If you've played this type of game before, you'll likely remember some of the strategies.  If not, you'll pick it up as you go.The visuals are fantastic.  The game is 2.5D, but the backgrounds are all wonderfully done 3D objects, as are the characters.  The art itself has something of a cartoon look to it, giving the game a comic book feel.  The music is nice and doesn't get in the way, but it adds atmosphere.  The rest of the sounds are your basic butt kicking sound effects and whatnot.Anyway, I'm glad I voted for this game on Greenlight and I'm glad I bought it.  It still has a long way to go, I have no doubt the developers have much more in store for us.  What they have so far is definitely promising and worth the money for fans of this type of game."

With only two stages, the game already have a pretty good variety of baddies, the combos are limited but a lot of fun, the enemies AI are pretty simple but challenging (they're always trying to surround you and attack you from behind) and it really takes you back to the good old arcade times.The only thing i didn't like about this game is the lack of originality.

Really need escape mechanic like rolling or evading, at later stage it's become so annoying when you got surrounded by dozen of enemies at the same time.It's already in playable state, just need more polishing and balancing here and there. Hope to see it in finished state soon."

Simply put, if you're a fan of what made old beat 'em ups so fun, you'll find it here.While the game describes itself as taking inspiration from the likes of Final Fight and Streets of Rage, I personally saw more of the latter in this game. The movesets feel a little less fleshed out than SoR, but if you love that series you'll know exactly what to do here with the 3 playable characters. The only really new things are readily-available guns, which you can draw at the press of a button and fire as long as you have ammo. A lot of enemies in the game have their own guns, and I'd say it all works out pretty well in terms of balancing. Aside from that, there's a RAGE meter that fills as you beat on enemies without getting damaged yourself, and when you feel overwhelmed, you can pop it and become invincible and super-strong.That being said, I feel that, while the game does have a decent enemy variety in terms of their functions, the game often puts too many on screen, forcing you to use special moves or your RAGE just to try to get control of things again. It feels like the game sometimes cheeses you, but it allows you to cheese it right back; I don't know how I feel about this. It's probably the game's worst point, honestly, because I don't think there should be points in a beat 'em up that get so out of hand you need to use a super weapon to clear the screen (to me, that's the difference between arcade quarter-crunchers like the X-Men arcade game, and more well-balanced affairs like SoR). But it's there, and it isn't the lion's share of the gameplay, which overall was quite enjoyable.Controls have a slight delay, but are solid--you'll get used to them.Graphics and sound are quite good for this sort of game, especially the music, which was excellent. I found myself wanting to track down songs and listen to them after I finished the game!I say The TakeOver is a winner. If the developers can do a little work on the balancing, and add more characters, enemies, and other content, we'll have something all too rare, and really special--a truly good, modern beat 'em up."

The part that bothers me is that it lacks originality. I felt the first stage was a carbon copy of SOR2/Bare Knuckle 2. The special attacks were similiar to those in that game as well. If this game can become more original, it could very well become one of the best out of the genre.Pros:Combat was easy to learnThe story, although cheesy, was very detailed in the comic stripsThe music was top notchIt had controller supportCons:The controller set up is a headache. I had to restart the game about 10 times to get it where I wanted.Unoriginal copy of SOR2.I'm not sure I like the guns play in the game."
