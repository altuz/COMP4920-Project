I figured I would play it for an hour and that would be it.  I was wrong.This game is so incredibly simple but yet never seems repetative.. even if the waves are exactly the same every time.. it holds it's replay value insanely well.The different guns that you can select on the fly are so much fun and so situationally genious.  The shield and tether-style melee weapon are amazing concepts (I never go without a shield... ever).The best things about this game:1) Room scale allows you to dodge incoming fire2) Surround sound allows you to pick up on audio clues for incoming drones3) Controls are perfect and swapping guns is seemless4) Challenging because it seems to scale indefinitely?5) Real time leaderboards make for insane replayability6) This is THE game for parties.  I swap in and out with my buddies as we compete for leaderboardsDo yourself a favor and buy a waterproof VRCover.. you will need it on this one!"

The recent updates have given it enough polish to make it a 'always installed' app. I don't expect them to make any more large changes to the game, but it is more or less complete.I'm better at this game when I've recently imbibed brown party-liquor.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=847692793"

It is regularly getting updates, and is definately fun in short bursts. It makes me feel like Han Solo, which is enough in my book;)Essentially, you dual wield any combination of guns and shields, and fight waves of flying invaders.Obviously, skill is involved, and you do get better as you learn little nuances and cues about your environment.Pros:+In a sea of VR shovelware, this is a fun arcade experience that I like showing to people+It doesn't try to be bigger than it is, but what it does - it does well+You will sweat and pantCons:-Once again, this is pure arcade fun, so don't come looking for RPG-esque upgrades or tons and tons of weaponsYeah, even though this was an early VR title, it continues to stand the test of time and hold its own."
76561197968761535,Recommended,418650,22664470,"Posted: 27 April, 2016",all,AnD4D,"This is a lot of fun, although it is very limited and kind of overpriced for what it is at the moment. You'll pretty much manage to do everything there is within the game within the first couple of minutes.Beyond that, it's fun to compete with friends.WEAPONSThe weapons are kind of cool, but I wish I had more choice. You just have a pistol at the moment, but it has different firing types.Single Shot:This is just your standard pistol, but you have a laser sight (In fact, it's currently the only one with a laser sight).Triple Shot:You no longer have the laser sight, but you do have 3 shots fired in rapid succession when you pull the trigger. In order to fire again, you'll need to release and pull the trigger again.Rapid Fire:All you need to do is hold the trigger to fire an endless supply of shots. The only problem is that the longer you hold the trigger, the slower the rate of fire.Charge Shot:Hold down the trigger to charge it up, and released it to do a shot that will pretty much always destroy your target. The problem is, you have to be accurate to make use of it. Your sight will turn green when you're about to make a kill shot, so looking down the sights is pretty handy.Laser:Fire a low powered laser from your gun. When you hit your target, they'll usually be stunned and start to fall. After a constant stream of shots, they'll blow up, but it's the slowest way of destroying the drones. HOWEVER! You if you equip a laser in both hands and cross the beams, you form a very powerful laser beam. This does massive damage, but of course, limits you to one direction of attack, and no defense.DEFENSEYou start the match with 3 lives. So that's 3 shots and you're out! Even rapid fire from behind will end your match pretty quickly, but the game slows down when you're close to an enemy laser. It creates this pretty amazing Matrix feeling. I'm not sure if you gain lives after X number of waves, but I have a feeling that's the case. Usually I'm too busy fighting to count how many lives I have left.Reach to your back and your gun is replaced with a shield. This can reflect shots back, and with a bit of luck, can actually reflect them back to your attacker. On top of this, pull the trigger to charge up and release a powerful shock wave. This can not only force your attackers back, but can also deflect shots.LEVELSThere's currently just the one level... it's pretty nice to look around, and you'll mainly be attacked from the front and sides, but there's no variety.ENEMIESBeyond colours, I'm not sure what else there is. I understand there'll be boss fights soon, but at the moment you'll just be dealing with floating sphere drones. The look cool, and sound cool... but essentially repetitive.MUSIC AND SOUNDThis is subjective, but I get a lot of excitement from it. Fast paced drum and bass, and a great beat makes you feel pretty powerful and unstoppable... that is until you hear a drone charge up and shoot you in the back.The guns sound awesome, and suitable. Nothing seems out of place or underpowered.CONCLUSIONIt has the potential to be a great game. At the moment it's fun and easy to drop in and out of, but don't expect too much at this time.Hopefully we'll have a greater selection of weapons in the future (shotgun, please!), and a story mode would be pretty cool. It has a nice level of polish, and I look forward to seeing what we get in the future.Yes, I'd recommend, even at this current level."

I was pretty bad to begin with, but I have crept up to 40K score and am getting better every day.

,Recommended,418650,30498482,Posted: 13 March,all,Dan,"Space Pirate Trainer was one of my first Vive purchases. The game's reviews were extremely positive, and it made it onto everybody's ""Best Games for the Vive"" lists. My own feeling after playing was that it was well-done and fun for ten minutes at a time, and worth buying as a curious early adopter, but not worth keeping installed. The only thing that made the experience compelling was the immersion that VR gives games for free.All these months later I reinstalled on a whim to show my friends, and I can't believe how much has been tweaked and added since launch. A better system for switching from a gun to a shield! A melee weapon! A whip! Grenades! Probably a bunch of other stuff I didn't notice yet! The game was okay before, but now it's great. I wish every ""early access"" game got patched and expanded half as well as SPT has."
,Recommended,418650,26600623,"Posted: 14 November, 2016",all,Bassem,"(detailed review coming later)One of the earliest - and still one of the best - VR wave shootersMoving around is key, and the many varied weapons and defenses allow for loads of loadouts and play styles. You have to stay alert and aware of the enemies as they move all around and above you. This game hones your awareness, reflexes, and hand eye coordination, all while piping some sweet beats into your ears to get you pumped.After the summer update that came out a couple months ago, SPT went from being a great little minigame to a much more full-fledged wave shooter. It could still use additional locations, but that isn't essential to the gameplay. However, the added weapons, enemies and powerups, as well as the new options for wave selection and other things, really fleshed out the game.Anyway, it's very much worth the 15$ asking price. There are pricier VR games that offer less. This is one you'll keep coming back to, and demoing to all your friends."
76561197970866188,Recommended,418650,28509587,"Posted: 21 December, 2016",all,The Maddog,"I'm going to recommend this game!First...the bad.The game is shallow. It's the VR equivlent of Space Invaders. Point, shoot, dodge or sheild. Thats pretty much it. You're not going to get a storyline. You're not going to get any overly complex gameplay aside from tougher and tougher waves. It's a wave shooter (one of many for VR at the moment).Now the Good.It's probably one of the better,if not best wave shooters.  It looks great, plays very well, has spot on physics and has cracking sound and music.I've had Space Pirate Trainer since April 2016 (Vive launch date) and in that time I've knocked up just shy of 7 hours gameplay.So the question is, why am I recommeneding the game with such little play time?  Well..it's moreish. You pop in, play for 10 mins, see if you can beat your last high score then pop out.  As I said,  SPT is nothing more than a wave shooter. You stand in one game area and battle wave after wave of robots with the odd boss thrown in to the mix. Your guns have various fire modes, can turn into a sheild mace / space whip if you fancy and there are various powerups to be had. It's very fun in short bursts but once you die, you pop out and play something else till the next time.SPT does what it does very well. It's obviously been polished very well in the last 14 months (it got boring really fast back in April but has had considerable work since launch) and I can only hope the dev continues to add new content (which they are).  A couple more enviroments to fight in, maybe a power up that pops out a robot to fight with you, multi player or maybe even a turret / cannon  spawning (that you can control) would go a long way to adding to game play.This early in consumer VR SPT is certainly a very good VR demo title (and has remained so for most of this year) and a fun title to play intermittently. It's a go to title for showing newbies the ropes but I would like to see SPT progress beyond that tech demo / old school wave shooter feel and offer something with a bit more meat on it's bones.If it's on sale then grab it. If not.....still kinda worth the price if you consider the long term repeat play."

Its an arcarde style shooter done right! The goal of the game is to shoot (or Pew, Pew) the hovering, one eyed robots that fly at you from the front, sides, and above. Getting a direct hit on the robots is very satisfying, and the game as a whole truly makes you fell bad♥♥♥♥♥ The weapon choices are minimal, but you do have the option to choose how the gun will fire which gives an extra level of customization. The music fits really well with the game, and you will sometimes find yourself dancing along, giving a shooting/dancing experience. SPT does get difficult after getting far enough in the wave levels, but retrying over and over again to attempt to get the top high-score of your local games, your friends, or even the world, provides a great replayablitly level! The amount of content is fairly slim, but for the price, I HIGHLY recommend it. Not only is there lots more content coming in the future, but at its current state it is still in my list of must buys for the Vive.So get out there Space Pirate and pew your way to victory!"
,Recommended,418650,22681986,"Posted: 27 April, 2016",all,"Communist ""Joseph Ballin"" Layton","Space Pirate Trainer is the sort of game that takes a mundane concept and makes it exciting just by being in VR, and in that regard it's hard to describe to people. At its core, Space Pirate Trainer is a game where you shoot robots with two pistols that have multiple firing modes. It would be extremely boring if it was a desktop game, and I don't know that I'd even pay $5 for it. But you can't adequately describe how it feels to see shots flying by your face in slow motion while you do a 90 degree bullet dodge bend to avoid a shot, or diving to the floor while raising your shield in the same motion to fend off a barrage of bullets. Space Pirate Trainer went from ""that game that looks kind of dull on the store page"" to ""the game I show off to everyone who comes around wanting to see my Vive"" in just a few minutes of playing."

This is hands down the most fun game for the vive that I have played, so do yourself a favour and buy it.Pros- Work up a sweat shooting laser, grenades, and shot guns at flying robots whizing around your head.- Work up a sweat whipping said robots into the ground and beating them with a futuristic laser stick.- Work up a sweat diving for the ground and rolling to avoid lasers.- Also great developers that up until this point have devlivered on their promises and not added any paid DLC. Regular and timely updates seems to be a rare thing with early access games but SPT has not disappointed.Cons- You are a hazard to furniture, loved ones, and small pets while playing this game.Becoming one of my favourite games to play for a half hour break in the evening, including non-VR games.I only hope that the developers bring back the option to quickly switch between your current and last weapon by hitting the top button, I found this really helpful in past versions of the game. It may also be a better way to choose between the shield and laser stick thing, at least as long as there are only the two options for that."

Some of the attention to detail like the animation for the different gun types or the worn paint on the guns giving the impression they have seen some action is also a nice touch.I cannot recommend this game enough, in my growing list of VR games it still sits right at the top - I hope we see more from these guys."
,Recommended,418650,32503551,Posted: 17 June,all,Baphomet,"Battle wave after wave of combat droids and hone your blaster skills in Space Pirate Trainer, a room scale VR wave shooter with 80's retro-future aesthetics.This game sets itself apart from other VR wave shooters in that you gain a bit of ""bullet time"" by allowing projectiles to almost hit you. During this time your own firing is slowed, but so is the movement of enemy droids, giving you precious few seconds to score a killing blow before the next incoming volley. As you can imagine this will happen a lot, leading to some tense moments where you have to swoop and dodge incoming attacks from multiple angles while returning fire.There’s also a global scoreboard system with a separate ranking for each weapon preference, giving a decent amount of replayability for its cost, so that’s neat. Hopefully the devs will add some more content, but considering the average VR game cost I would rate an investment in SPT as “acceptable”."
,Recommended,418650,24430266,"Posted: 20 July, 2016",all,Zero Summ,"Pros:One of the best VR titles out so far. And in my opinion, the gold standard for arcade VR FPS.Well polished environment.Aiming and shooting action feels great.Overall graphics looks nice and crisp , particles and lighting are some of the best I've seen so far in VR.Simple concept that's easy to understand. However, as you play you see a lot of hidden depth. Eventually you'll develope specific strategies for troublesome waves. (Waves are static on each playthrough)Waves are different enough as you progress that it always keeps you on your toes.Inclusion of a local leaderboard is vital, as it makes SPT a great party game as participants try to one up each other.It's a damn good workout if you're in tryhard mode.Neutral:Additional levels, weapons, and enemies would be a welcome addition. SPT is an early access game, hopefully we'll see plenty of new content in the future.Lacks even a basic tutorial that explains the compass (with life meter above it). I don't think I figured that out until atleast 20 minutes of gameplay.Cons:The price/playtime might be a bit high for some people as it can get repetetive. That being said, I believe the $15 price tag is justified. Simply put, $15 is resonable given the current state of the VR market. Devs need to charge more if they're selling to a smaller playerbase."

So if you want to have a party to show all your friends your brand new vive then I would suggest showing them this game.One big bonus for me is the different firing modes for the pistol.

I dunno, for ambiance maybe?) and all these drones fly up in front of (and over and around and behind) you and you have to use your guns (Vive controllers) to shoot them down.   You can take 3 hits (apparently they seem to aim for my head only) before it's game over.  Enemies come in waves and they are increasingly numerous and difficult.The handle of the Vive controller becomes the gun's handle (if that helps you visualize how you're holding them) and of course the trigger is the trigger.  You can use the touchpad to select different firing styles from: pistols with laser sights that shoot bullets, a laser pistol that shoots bolts in bursts, a laser pistol that fires in a continuous stream of shots, a laser that you charge up and does massive damage when you let go of the trigger (sorta like a sniper rifle?), and finally you get a beam laser that doesn't do much damage but it's super simple to aim.Each gun has a sight on it that you can look down to help aim but most of the time you'll just be shooting from the hip (not using the sights).  Also, you can reach behind your back to turn a gun into a shield  and use that to block incoming shots.  If you're a defensive type you can keep one gun and one shield, and if you're rambo you can go ""guns akimbo"".Apparently the shield isn't wholly defensive.  you can ricocchet shots to attack the enemy with their own bullets, and if you push the trigger a shockwave forms from the shield and knocks all the enemies back (but doesn't damage them as far as I can tell).  It's sort of a shield bash.Things I like:Upbeat music keeps the energy flowingLots of fun arcade style actionWeapons seems fairly balanced so that the easier ones to aim do less damageIt's simple to learn so you don't need to study a manual before you go inThis is the kind of game that benefits greatly from a LOT of floor space.Things I didn't like:Since the enemies can go over and behind you, sometimes you REALLY need to duck and/or move quickly (I bumped the wall not realizing how close I was)the gun sights seem mostly useless... It's a nice touch, especially for the firing mode where you charge your shots, but it's really hard to look down the sights especially in the heat of battle.Having to reach behind you to grab your shield and reach again to restore your gun is cool, but I'd prefer a smaller shield that I could just bring up with a button press instead.I really had to struggle to find something bad to say about this game. It's probably the most fun full-room game right now."

It is a thrill to play and has a ton of reply value. Much more replay value than most of the other titles that are currently available.The game is very physical. If you want to get far in it, you have to dodge, duck and move your shield all around you. It gets more and more challenging the further you get. The difficulty progression is near perfect.The basic idea is to destroy all the flying bots that hover around the room and occassionally shoot at you with your laser pistol(s). A very simple concept implemented masterfully.The real thrill comes when one masters the mechanics of the game to survive through ten or more bots on the screen at once with multiple bots shooting at the same time! There are several things the developer implemented to allow one to survive such an onslaught.First, one has the ability to use a shield. This is most effectively used in a blind area where you know at least one or more bots are flying around but you are focusing on other areas of the room. When it gets really intense, you'll have to crouch down to really decrease your hit box size and also more effectively protect yourself with the shield. However, the downside is a loss in mobility in using the other main mechanic to protect yourself, simply dodging out of the way of the shots coming at you. When you are shot at, the game alerts you with a warning sound and also slows down time, so you have a real fighting chance to avoid the attacks.Additionally, the game makes excellent use of sound. The bots that are close to you sound louder and you can hear the ""hum"" sound they make at all times. The shots they fire also make a sound. This aids greatly in knowing where the other bots are and where to aim your shield or how to dodge when one shoots at you. There is also a map in the lower front portion of the room that allows you to get a quick visual inspection of where all the bots are at.Finally, when a bot is about to attack you, you can hear it power up and also see it glow as it charges its weapon. You have the ability to shoot it to stop the attack. If you hit it the attack will be disrupted. Further, when you destroy a bot, the explosion disrupts the other bots in the area, stopping their attack and causing them to fly about from the impact.The real thrill comes when you master the sound mechanic and efficient use of this map to protect yourself with your shield and determine when to crouch and when to duck and dodge. To master the game you'll have to use all these skills multiple times in the later waves.This game is a must purchase in my opinion for anyone who has the Vive. I like it even better than Audioshield. Audioshield is great and also has excellent replay value but it doesn't have the difficulty progression that Space Pirate Trainer has (and the thrill of overcoming an especially difficult challenge that comes with that), which is why I prefer it."

Not only can you dodge the incoming lasers, You literally pull a shield from your back to block them as well, the drawback being ofcourse that you only have one gun, instead of two by doing so. But if you want a shield that also has a bit of offensive punch, swith to the lightsaber fishing pole laser grabber thingy majiggy, Not sure what to call it but basically you can block the shots with a sword, that can also pull in your enemies. then you can choose to slam them into the ground, or blast them with your favorite choice of 6 types of guns, that are quickly accessible VIA Thumb pad. Bottom line, you'll sweat and have a good time doing so. You might even catch yourself getting pumped up by the great sound track and yelling at the dang drones that our trying to kill you.

I'm sure there are comparable games out there for Vive right now, but this is the one I played and I had lots of fun with it.As far as I can tell there are several ways to play this. One is the gun+shield way, which is what I'm most comfortable with right now (not quite confident in fast roomscale movements yet). Shooting around the shield, taking cover, ducking with your shield above your head, etc are all very thrilling and immersive. It makes you feel like a total badass.The second is dual guns, which really requires you to move around to dodge all the incoming shots. I'm not quite there yet (still a bit afraid of slamming into tables or walls) but this should provide a much more physical experience.Only downside is that, as far as I could tell, there's only really one enemy type. Would be great if there were some sort of variation: minibosses, other kinds of enemies, maybe splash damage or other kinds of area weapons, obstacles, etc.Strongly recommend for anyone with a Vive!"

If you like games like Galaga or Space Invaders, where there is very little variety and the game just gets faster and harder, you will like SPT. However, my problem with SPT, is that there is very little variety. You get the same robots coming at you round after round. There are more robots, they get faster, and they surround you. This game needs different robots, a variance of difficulty on each level, and reasons to use different weapons. Personally, I can barely make it to round 10, and by the time I get there, I'm frustrated and ready to play a different game. As I said, it is fun, but it gets too frantic too quickly. And without any variety, it just becomes an exercise in complete frustration and boredom. Add different robots, vary the difficulty between levels (i.e. not every level NEEDS to be harder than the last level) and this will be a winner. I'm recommending this game with the above conditions, hoping the developer will improve the game."

The graphics are great, it captures the arcade game style and the music is absolutely fantastic. The shield mechanic works well. But, it's repetetive.

You're stuck on the same platform fighting the same type of enemy robot over and over again, and every time you die you're starting all over again.This game lacks some sort of progression/boss/power-up system, and different environments. Just being able to e.g. shoot random power-ups to your gun or shields, or having boss waves or different types of enemies would serve this game well.If the devs end up expanding this game with more content like this I'll purchase it again, no doubt about it.

After playing several VR games and thinking ""Wow, this is cool!"", I finally tried Space Pirate Trainer and actually discovered what good VR looked like. Merely standing in the menu made me giddy. So for $15, do you get your VR hype rocket-ship? You most certainly do.However, for $15, do you get a good game? Well, maybe. As with all early-access games, SPT has potential for greatness. Swapping each hand between a shield and guns and assigning each gun a different shooting style while going TRON-Rambo is great fun.Eventually, you ask ""When do the enemies get harder?"". Much to your chagrin, they don't; just more of them spawn. The core gameplay gets a little stale once you've been fighting increasingly larger waves of the same two drones for 20 minutes. If this game were not VR, it would not be very engaging at all.As it stands, SPT holds itself up on a temporary VR crutch. Over time, it will likely evolve into a great game, as the developers clearly understand what VR should encompass. As for the time being, it's certainly worth trying out."

I bought this on sale @ 50% off for $8 and the graphics, gameplay, and overall feel of this game are exactly what I expected. This game is replayable in that it is an easy 5-10 minute pickup at the start or end of any VR session, and it never seems to get old (in and of itself, wave shooters are wearing thin these days, though). Great weapon options, music (not soundtrack though, its only 3 songs), and overall ""feel"" for a VR shooter.That said, this game is extremely limited in what it offers: identical waves of droids to shoot at with different weapons and a scoreboard for each one. While entertaining and replayable due to its great polish, the pricetag is steep for a game with such little original content. Recommended as an entertaining glimpse of what's to come, but without any additional levels or modes this game will surely be surpassed by the next titles of 2017."

My legs are killing me right now from ducking and diving around my room like I was in The Matrix.It's a fairly straight forward game. Wave of enemies come at you from nearly every direction in Galaga-esque formations. I could be wrong but I've only seen two types of enemies, currently. One is simply more ""tanky"" than the other. You also have a radar in front of you to help you get an idea of where they are and what to expect. Once you've been shot 3 times, that's the end of your Neo/Trinity masquerade.You get 5 firemodes for each weapon in your hands. Single shot (You get an exclusive laser pointer with this firemode), burst fire, automatic fire, charged single shot (one shots anything as far as I'm aware), and continuous beam fire. Also you can reach behind your back with either hand and swap out for a shield on the fly. I've found the best combination for me personally is using the fully automatic mode on both pistols.There is a visual and audio queue of enemies charging up before they fire so you can prepare to deal with them in quite a few ways. For instance, you can...1. Shoot and destroy the drones. (Obviously)2. Shoot and stun them, which prevents them from firing temporarily.3. Shoot the drone's lasers out of the air.4. Dodge the lasers. Time will always slow down when they fire at you.5. Switch to your shield quickly and deflect them.There's of course a leaderboard which shows some people with some ridiculous high scores. It makes me think they just laid on the ground with a shield deflecting bullets. But eh. Also, it's worth noting there's a couple options that I actually preferred changing in the menu, such as the barrel angle and sights. For barrel angle I found it more natural turning it all the way down as the gun naturally shoots upwards which feels strange to me. As for the sights, I chose the 3 dot sight because it's quicker to use in the heat of the moment.Overall, it's currently one of my favorite Vive games. Even as it is, it's worth it, in my opinion.. but I can't wait to see what they add in the future."

I got to demo the HTC Vive at a local gaming event where someone brought one to show off, and when I got a turn he fired up this game and handed me the controllers.  It was an absolute blast to play for the 5 minutes or so that I had to play it.  I was so impressed with the experience that two weeks later I have my own Vive and this was my first purchase for it.  I play it every day at least a few games.  It's a decent workout for a video game...especially if you go dual weapons and no shields and try to dodge all the lasers (which is incredibly fun to do).  Runs smoothly on both my desktop and laptop at 1x sampling with everything off (desktop is an R9 290X and laptop is a GTX 1060), but turning them up starts to cause stuttering.The weapon selection is great, and even playing entirely with unconventional weapons like the grenade launcher can be a fun challenge.  It's not a super deep gameplay experience, it's just your good old arcade wave shooter, but in VR, and really that's all I want from it.  It's fun to beat your high scores and change up your play style."

'Only 1k more and i got your score, Dave. Wait... why are all the drones gone? *turns around and looks up* AH, SCREW THIS! Stop laughing, Dave. Get out of my god damn house, you son of a female dog!'.What i also like is the fact that you have a 50% chance of getting your shield when you need it. But you always have a 100% chance of keeping the shield when you want to switch back.Play long enough and you will want to shower. Great work out when you have to dodge many bullets without that shield you swore you just pulled out.By the way even though you have 2 shields on your back, they do not protect you from those sneaky little drones that somehow got behind you. They are also the reason you will die right before that sweet highscore.Also Dave is a male reproductive organ."

76561198042105634,Not Recommended,418650,33600917,Posted: 16 July,all,Verdant Rapture,"Bug Report: Oculus Rift - Steam VR loses tracking ability very often.So unfortunately this game disconnects every 10-20 minutes of gameplay, seemingly randomly.  Sometime I can tell when an action is going to cause the Rift to disconnect from Steam VR, but often it's in the middle of heated battle.  This is the only game I experience this in.  The Lab, 5089, and Fruit Ninja have, thus far, not given me any connectivity issues whatsoever.  This is the only reason this review is getting a thumbs down.  It's not entirely fair to the developer, but I've also seen a lot of developers reach out when they see bad reviews, so it's proven to be a powerful mechanic in the past.Otherwise, this game is absolutely splendid.  I've only had VR for less than a week, and have been pretty picky about what is actually 'fun.'  Thus far, Robo Recall, KingSpray (unfortunately Oculus Store, because the Steam version doesn't work with Oculus), Fruit Ninja and Space Pirate Trainer have been the only games that have really stuck out as amazing expieriences.At first, the game appears to lack depth.  You've got a pair of guns, I believe the default are 2 machine guns, and a menu box that says you can change guns with the joysticks, or reach over your shoulders to switch to shields.  But there's a lot the game doesn't tell you.  I'm not going to spoil what that may be, but experimenting with different combinations of guns and shields is key to surving very far into this game--unless you're seeking a specialty leaderboard, like my favourite, dual shield.  Dual shield is by far the most gratifying 'class' I've experienced.I've had the game a day, have 5.5 hours of play, and rank in the top 3000 in a few of the global leaderboards.  Climbing from here take a lot of patience, but especially so, due to losing connectivity all the time.  Really, if that weren't happening all the time, I'd probably have double the play time.  But sometimes the bug goes so far as to force me to restart Steam altogether.So beware Oculus owners.  At this point, it may make more sense to buy this on the Oculus store; though I have no idea if the issue is any better over there.  However, I still do highly recommend this as being one of the most, if not THE most rewarding experience I've had in VR to date.And for the developers:I5 2500k24GB ram @ 1300GTX 1080TI FTW3Win 10Please, if anyone has any ideas to improve connectivity, I'd love to know and change this review to another thumbs up."

Sure you can change weapon types but you only really do that until you find the type that suits you (lasers all the way). Only 1 enemy, only 1 location. This kind of arcade game could have floated 20 years ago but we really need more gameplay.- This game is at most worth $5. Hence, vastly overpriced.If you still aren't convinced, buy it.

For that reason, the dodge mechanics become very important.Holopoint requires a fairly significant amount of dodging.  Part of what makes that possible is the single shots coming from bad guys that don't track your movement.  Something shoots, I see it, and move out of the way.  Eventually too many things shoot and I die, but the single shot mechanics ""work"" for me and keep me active.With SPT, I find myself standing still, and just blocking incoming streams of fire with my shield.  I dodge slightly, but because the fire stream tracks my movements, I eventually have a line of fire that intersects with my head no matter where I move.  I suppose I could continually try to avoid that line, but I'm either too lazy or not coordinated enough to do that.  So, I stand, shoot, and block.  and eventually die.  Less fun for me, probably not worth purchasing unless your goal is to exercise 1 arm.If there was a way to make incoming fire shoot single shots, I'd probably play a lot more and recommend the game to others."

Truth be told my knees are too old and worn to allow me the requisite free flowing limb movements essential to reach those high scores – my best performance to date is level 14. But I can hardly blame the developer for that!The ability to switch from shields to guns on either hand is great as is the option to switch a shield into an 'attractor' which lasso's the drone bot and allows you to throw it at other bots or simply smash it into the floor – rather satisfyingPre upgrade to beta, I thought this game was lacking too much to get out the high score flag. But as of now the price tag is looking rather more reasonable and I detect the first tingling of addiction.

Dodge the bullet from all direction and shoot back! But be careful, you can only be hit three times.The fame mode is simple, only dodging and shooting. There are 5 kinds of weapons available and all of them can be used by both hands. The gaming speed slowed down when enemy bullet comes, giving players more time to response, you can also use your shield to block the bullet.The unique movement recognition system is also the highlight. You can switch weapons by particular movement, for example when your hand reaches the backside of your head in the game, your weapon will be automatically switched into shield, as if you are carrying the shield all the way.The immersive experience is also important and Space Pirate Training did well on this. The UI style perfectly fit the gaming environment. Special effect occurs when you are hit by bullet, after that, the path of that bullet will also be displayed.The simple gaming mode is the only fatal weakness of this game, shooting enemies wave after wave quickly bored players.The game is now a demo, Looking forward to the better performance in the future.To talk, play and share your ideas about virtual reality, please join us:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/viriver"

Occasionally, drones drop powerups on death. Like the devs and many others will say, it's pretty much the VR equivalent of Space Invaders. This makes it very easy to pick up, while the scoring system gives players something to aspire to, and thus keep playing.The graphics of the game are very appealing: a cyberpunk tower overlooking a city as you blast your way to a high score, while your ship (presumably broken) lay behind you.The weapons are nicely varied, and gunplay is enjoyable. The melee weapons are also very satisfying, and slamming a drone onto the floor with twin Voltons makes you feel very empowered. The sound and music are spot-on and fit the theme very well: however, I personally find it more enjoyable to play my own music in the background.Overall, if you own a VR headset, and want an arcade-style game that is fun and engaging, I believe this is currently one of the best wave-shooters in VR at the moment."

The fast paced gameplay and James Marvel's fantastic drum & bass soundtrack are guaranteed to make players break a sweat and increase their heart rate.  It's the perfect marriage of classic arcade simplicity and VR immersion. The developers have successfully taken elements of Galaga, first person shooters and late '80s/early '90s bullet hell shooters to create one hell of a VR game.The game is simple, yet has enough nuance to keep you engaged. There are multiple weapon types, a shield, and even a lasso/melee type weapon to allow for a good variety of play styles. Of all the gun games I've played for the Vive, Space Pirate Trainer's guns are the most tangible; you really feel like you're holding pistols that can be best described as a hybrid of Han Solo's blaster and Judge Dredd's Lawgiver. The haptic feedback is perfection and the track pad selection method is quick and intuitive.The fast pace and initial simplicity make Space Pirate Trainer the perfect starting point for room scale VR. It's the game I use to introduce friends to the Vive."

But thankfully the controls are done just right. And it's got great play mechanics.What makes it stand out over the other shooter games is the ability to really dodge the bullets (similar to SUPERHOT but very limited) or bounce them back with the shield. The only cons to the game was the lack of multiplayer or social aspects of it.. Yes i can see my friends scores and try to beat there records, but i have seen some similar games starting to incorporate coop in there shooters (such as serious sam VR).

If you want something to see quality in the vive it is deffo one to try at least but the only problem is the type of game may not be for you. The game also not very intensive and you can actually run it easily even below the minimum requirements for running the vive.The game is extremely repetetive however they have started to add new more powerful enemies and sort of mini bosses in waves. I have not got amazingly far so I cant tell how many there are but it does get quite challanging in terms of new enemy types rather than just swarming you like it used to in the past.To be honest I see this more of a sort of party game/play every now and then game rather than a game I decide to spend hours after hours trying to get amazing at. Yes you can majorly improve but there is no progression as such. Yes you can continue from waves to try to get further but there is no progression as such.There is not a huge selection of weapons though most of the weapons are unique and you will very quickly finding yourself choosing your favourite generally or for situations.This is a quite active jump around to dodge game or use a shield to block everything.

Set your freinds up to play a couple of rounds without playing the tutorial - just let them blast away. Then In the next game tell them ""hey, reach over behind your back"" and watch their expression of awe as they pull out that awesome shield.It's almost worth buying for that moment alone.Back in the real world though, thumbs upBUTthis game is early access and quite limited for the £10 price tag IMO. It needs more levels, more vaired attack waves, and different environments.Great game to show off VR to mates though."

Controls are intuitive. Everything is responsive.I have don't have room for a room-scale setup, but I'm still thoroughly enjoying this game. My PC is also slightly under spec, but I haven't had any problems yet.I've seen a bunch of reviews complaining how there isn't much to do. I'd argue that there is plenty to do. Yes, this game is pretty much just shooting flying robots. I'd make a comparison to playing a sport. In soccer, pretty much all you do is run around and kick a ball. Both take a lot of practice. It'll get more interesting the better you get. I think that most people would think it's strange if someone complained that there's not more modes in soccer, or that it's lame because you only use one type of ball.If you think this game is shallow, check out the leaderboard and compare your high score to the top.The only negative I have of this game is that the soundtrack is meh. But you can turn the soundtrack off, so there's not really a problem there.Also, I guess this game is still in beta? Man, I'm excited to see what the final product is like.RAIL GUNSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS"

It's a very good way if you wanna spend some fun time in VR without having to finish a mission or find a saving point and its a good way to show your friends how VR works, like a quick introduction to VR.There's just one con about this game is that it can get repetitive, you know i'm just shooting drones, different kinds and difficulty levels, but still, drones. Maybe if i advance through some waves i will see new enemies we will see.All in all, good game, no glitches, fun gameplay, easy to pick and play, i like the weapons and shields, the powerups are a nice arcade-ish touch. Could use different weapons and different enemies.Thumbs up for now.."
