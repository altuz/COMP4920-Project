,Recommended,418670,32406780,Posted: 14 June,all,dschoon,"Excellent:- This game is gorgeous.Good:- As a platformer, the developers at least know their history and the fare is varied and skill-testing. As someone raised on Metroid, I did not find any of the levels excessively hard. Sure, you should think a bit. But look, I spent four lifetimes in Blaster Master and never even finished the second stage.- The bosses are somewhat clever. More is done with less.- Level design is actually quite good and varied. Complexity is layered nicely.- Yes, this means you're not going to find anything mindblowing or new (it's no Braid) but whatever. You're here bc it's vvvv pretty.Bad:- It's true the controls are more than a littel clunky. (Throw Sword rarely triggers on the first press. The charge-up special takes One Full Second of holding a button, which is wildly too long in a vigorous platformer.)- Many things are expressed as Well-Drawn Icons and there's no bloody way I remember what the hell they mean. I missed two ... blue yin-yangs? I haven't even seen a blue yin-yang! Wait, I've collected 7? OKAY GREAT I AM SURE I AM DOING WELL THEN.- Many things do not have help text. But you know of course there's extensive background on the lives and history of every blob monster. Illustrated background. Which is pretty.Oh Come On:- Ability text has typos. :POverall, Pankapu is fun and gorgeous: totes worth $5."

Looks like their dream to create a good game came true.Worth the money? Yes.NOTE:Episode 2 is not out yet. If you buy both episodes, you are pre-ordering episode 2. Something I think that should be denoted on the store page and the description. As of now the game offers 5-7 hours of gameplay.Gameplay & MechanicsPlays and feels alot like Trine, as its a standard platformer where you can change roles between melee/ranged/wizard type of deal. Episode 1 includes ONLY the melee and ranged forms, as well as two different weapon augments.The weapon augments change your current forms abilities to help deal with different situations.As far as I can tell, utilizing the abilities is not totally covered in episode 1, and will most likely be explored in later episodes.The level design is good, and usually offers unique challenges for each level.It also includes a good amount of collectables on each level. As well as having multiples paths to beat each level.It plays with a mario-esque type of map for level selection. The UI is great, and minimal. And the menu is a book that you can flip through for the map, info, and options. A nice touch.The controls feel great and fluid. Its really hard to find any fault with the gameplay at all.The game is also moderately difficult and isnt too hard or too easy.I would have to say that so far I have found the bosses too easy though.If I had to nitpick, some hit boxes seem a little strange when attacking something slightly above/below your swings.On top of that my controller would keep skipping dialogue boxes during any dialogue scenes.Graphics & musicThe soundtracks are superb. No wonder, two composers from fricken Secrets of Mana (1993) worked on the music.The artwork and graphics are top notch. You can see the talent of the developers come through here. Maybe its just me after reviewing tons of cruddy games, but it was nice to see a such a polished and stylised game."

If you like games like that because the 80's era of gaming made you a masochistic ♥♥♥♥ then go for it, you'll probably dig the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it. I hate it. Like, a lot because of that.I'm only recommending it for it's technical competence, concept and overall art style. Once again, Steams limited rating system isn't appropriate for my final verdict but whatever."

It's too frustrating to be entertaining.Advice to content creators:- If you're going to make a metroidvania style game, don't ignore the success of those before you."

The control are responsive, which is so important in these games. The characters are charming. There is a beautiful menu screen, including a map area. From what i can see, there are also collectibles. You gain different powers as you progress. Been playing for about an hour, and definitely love where this game is going. If you enjoy light hearted platformers, with charm and a nostalgic 90s feel- you can't go wrong with this. And at the price, its a steal. Just remember, there are two episodes. Currently only one is available."

Some times just to find some hidden collectibles that were previously unattainable, other times you'll be able to reach new exits that will in turn uncover alternative paths on the map.In this sense, it's less""Super Mario""and more""Shantae""- which isn't a bad thing in my book.On the technical side of things, the game is fine.The graphics options are limited, but that's to be expected given the nature of the game.It should run on a toaster and also does have PC-typical settings for high refresh rates, rebindable gamepad layouts and such, so nothing sticks out as sorely missing.All in all, the game is very enjoyable and absolutely worth a try."

Love.Those are the first words that came to my mind when I finished the last part of this first episode.In this 2D action Platformer, you will have the hard task to save Omnia from the nightmares invasion. However, you will also discover another story at the same time: the one of Djaha'Rell.Those 2 entwined stories are very well told. When you discover Djaha'Rell's story, you will be amazed at the gorgeous arts that you will fully understand only if you discover all the secrets this game offers.On the other hand, Pankapu's story is much more epic, but there are also very touching moments (Photo's character will bring tears to your eyes!)Pankapu is very easy to control. You can jump, attack, protect yourself, but you are also able to make some special attacks (great visual effects by the way!).And that's not all! At some point, you will be able to use another form: The Ardour Aegis. It's similar to a DPS class in RPGs, for it can use a bow, so you can attack at long range. However, you are going to use all of your abilities to get through all the different levels and defeat your foes! Some will be quite easy to kill, but you are going to face an entire army of enemies!As to the level design, there are some really challenging moments, but it's not extremely hard. There are some difficult moments, but when you pass them, it's very gratifying and you'll feel proud. Moreover, you'll feel even prouder if you find everything this game offers (memories of Djaha'Rell, the Mudjins to find...)Oh, and I have to mention the soundtrack. Kikuta made a great main theme for the game. And Ganae (the main composer of the game) will bring music to your ears. I completely fell in love with the final boss track. It's so epic and touching at the same time... Pankapu also has a narrator that will tell you the story and transport you in this both cute/terrifying world! Let's not forget the dialogues with Chii (your very talkative acolyte) that are very good and bring some light on this universe (including some jokes too!)As for the visual aspect of this game, Pankapu is very gorgeous (it's surprising to see an indie game with such high quality, graphically speaking!). There are some cute characters (Ohiti!) and some really scary (i won't say which for we're in spoiler territory) and when you finish it,you will be eager to go back in this land of dreams.I usually am not a fan of episodic games, but the developers at Too kind studio made this format Right for this game. I'm looking forward to episode 2, and at such a low price (the game is quite long to complete!) It's totally worth it! If you love platformers, or 2D action games, then you should definitely get this one!"

Well, there is the false advertising.  I bought episode 1, apparently, even though the adverts were not clear and the trailer shows three forms, but you only get two in this episode.  A bit frustrating with the poor advertising, but I forgive it because this game has smart platforming that evolves as you go and really, REALLY smart level design.  Every level has secrets, however if you pay close attention you can see almost all of them out of the corner of your eye.  The game leaves smart hints to help you find secrets.  Boss fights are pretty weak, though, sadly.  For the price, you can do much worse.  Pankapu is a lot of fun, well animated, pretty, and has great level design.  Play it now."

Most of what I wanted to say has been covered by other reviews, so I will note a few things besides.- The trailer advertises 3 forms and multiple weapon enchantments, whereas the first episode only provides 2 forms and 1 weapon enchant.- For $10 you get around 6 hours of gameplay including all the collectibles. Once you finish the main story arc, you can go through all the levels again in a more challenging Time Trial mode to earn Bronze, Silver or Gold medals, which can easily add 3+ hours, depending on your success.- The first episode concludes in a satisfying manner, e.g. I did not feel cheated financially or emotionally.- I experienced some motion sickness symptoms while playing this game. It may have to do with how the movement is done. For those of you with similar susceptibility, be warned."

Simple but solid platforming gameplay and combat open up into a challenging and only rarely frustrating experience.Though the difficulty ramps up- particularly in the last quarter of what is currently available to play- it never does so in such a way that I felt cheated or expected to perform with pixel-perfect accuracy. Impatience and lack of planning are your worst enemies in this game, and it certainly does punish both.Even for more casual players however, the game's atmosphere and beautiful aesthetics more than make the experience pleasant and refreshing."

I was pleasantly surprised when the difficulty started to ramp up. The music is absolutely incredible, and the artwork is clean and well done. The level design and execution was well thought out.The story is so-so, as the dialogue doesn't excite me much, but it's still pleasant. It was jarring to have a mix of modern vernacular/sass and high fantasy.  The combat is fun, but my key frustration was lacking the ability to attack straight up or at an angle. F**k those f**cking bats!  I liked the varying degrees of challenge with the platforming elements.Overall I really enjoyed the game, even though it was on the shorter side, and I'm excited for the next installment."

At first I was a bit dissapointed because, Pankapu seems like a slow pace platformer game and the movement feels a bit cluncky. But along the way when I get used to it, everything start to be interesting. The gameplay really tease our motoric and pattern recognition skill.Eventhough the narration presented well and lightly, unfortunately I'm not really satisfied with the visual presentation. Don't get me wrong. I really like the character and environtment design, but it lack a bit of visual effect polishing. There are still a lot of room for improvvement in this aspect.Good luck for the next episode! I'm looking forward to play it."
