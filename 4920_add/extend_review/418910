,Recommended,418910,19285521,"Posted: 26 November, 2015",all,Ryan Dorkoski,"If you like casual titles such asAdVenture CapitalistorClicker Heros, but may want a little more complexity, thanIdle Civilizationis certainly worth checking out.Its one ofthosegames. I generally feel guilty for enjoying some of those mindless clicker-fest titles where there is no end-goal, and nothing changes from day 1, except numbers getting larger. With that being said, I do like them, and the idea of having more complexity and slightly different stages of strategy sounds really good. This is whatIdle Civilizationis trying to do.Pros:+Idle clicker game that is trying to raise the bar for this relatively new genre+Its cheap+Has a welcome layer of complexity not found in other games like this+Addictive, like all the othersCons:-Some menus need work. Why not have all the options (or buttons) on the same screen? No need to scroll, and have giant buttons (plus the scroll is not linked to middle mouse button). Or at least give the user the option to have everything on the same screen. Its Early Access, so this is acceptable at this point, I suppose.-Like other idle clickers, it doesn't matter what new options do when they open up - JUST CLICK THEM. There is little strategy in early to mid game here.-I believe it has to be open to earn you stuff. I don't think back-calculates time after you open it up a day later (likeAdVenture Capitalist, etc.). This is fine, I guess, its just slightly different.Yeah totally worth it for me. But that comes with the caveat that you like idle clicker games.If you are not sure, just downloadAdVenture Capitalist(its free and on Steam), and if you find time flying away, then look at this title."

,Recommended,418910,26628022,"Posted: 16 November, 2016",all,Protoss,"What is Idle Civilization?Idle Civilization is an idle game that - ironically - can keep you busy.Whereas in most idle games you have only one resource you mainly spend, and then one reset resource, here you have five main resources, one complementary resource and one reset resource. The game simulates a colony, a settlement in the middle of rich grasslands, with forests and mines abundant. You use food mainly to receive more population (more on this later). Wood and Stone are used to build basic buildings, Metal and Gold are used for more advanced buildings. Sadly each building uses only up to two different resources - more depth would have been good here, even if it wouldn't change the gameplay much. The sixth resource is faith which has no real use beyond a certain income and can't be traded. More on faith later.I feel like the game is explained best by the order it unlocks its things, so let me try to give an overview here.At the beginning you have a settlement with two people - I assume they are one male and one female, and please don't make the incest jokes then as I will also assume that the population mainly comes from people immigrating, not from them having thousands of genrations of children.Starting out:So you have those two people, but no resources and no research. Thankfully the tutorial tells you what to do: You click ten times to gather food (if you go for all ingame achievements you will need to click on each of the three collectible items 10,000 times in total, while in reality you would need less than 200 clicks in total there for the entire game). After you got the ten food, you can do your first research, after which your people can be freely assigned to any resource you know - food, wood and stone at the beginning. So you should assign them to wood, build a hut, assign them to food to get more population. Now with six population, you distribute them equally, so you have an income of all resources. After about one minute you can build a building that generates food, wood or stone. Of course, you choose wood. After another minute or so, you build the first stone building. You keep on building more then, and when you have three or four you go for the next higher tier which takes like ten times the resources but generates a lot more as well. So you get more income, can build more huts and population.Exploration:So far, so standard. Now you can research writing, which enables you to do pretty much everything. It is a prerequisite to metal working, but also enables a random event system with only few bad events. I am not sure if exploration is unlocked now or was already from the start. On exploration you send up to half of your current population to explore the neighborhood. They are either sent on a 20 second exploration with no risk, or later on a 40 second exploration with some risk of dying (you will need drafted but not specialized soldiers for that, more on this later). Each exploration gives you the chance to see a strange event. NEVER click on no here - the strange events always have a positive outcome, and one of the first gives you even a permanent bonus that includes higher birth rates (which further down the road translates into a higher max population but for now only saves some food and time), a 50 percent production bonus, and much more.Metal and Coins, Reset:You unlock metal now which unlocks coins. This for now allows you to do further research. At some point you will have 10 colony points (125 civilization points) and you will want to reset the game, but not before having gotten religion. More info below. Invest the few points so you always start with writing, have higher income, By now you will think you never get to 100 colony points, but this is not true - things will soon explode.After the reset, things go a bit faster, you get back to the point where you were before, including unlocking religion. Things go slightly faster now, and eventually you can unlock wages which don't really do much now - the first few colonies take a while to set up.Wages will increase your income. Simple as that. You pay a percentage of coins produced, but the gain is so high that  you make more money up to a high extent, essentially multiplying all income. When you have enough resources to build the highest coin production building, you are in for that treat, if not before.Other activities:You will have access to religion which allows you to choose one of six deitys, each with five spells that charge over time and need faith to do so - the production will soon be enough to fill all up constantly. Depending on your playstyle each deity has its advantages, but the war deity is especially helpful when you set out to conquer the entire world for the first time. After that, you will have enough colony points to invest into a 100 colony points perk that reduces food costs for new population extremely, so you can always keep on drafting. For that reason, you will also invest some into the perk that drafts more people at once and the one that increases birthrates. At the end, I think Chrysantema is good to choose as she provides a bonus to colony points and free research etc. for the next colony. In fact, if you choose her for your very first colony and use all her abilities ten times (at least the three that stack), the second colony will get you greatly further in the game. But combined with the 100 colony points thing she is even better. The thing is just, you need all six gods for all ingame achievements, so you will want to do them in the early colonies to choose those later that you want to use.Anyway, eventualy you also unlock a tavern - possibly by choosing the perk - and can have a free hero thanks to the permanent bonus from the strange sighting. The hero is sent on adventures which makes him gain experience - needed to unlock more adventures - and find valuable items, at least in the sense that they grant extra bonuses. Selling them for a small glory price is not recommended, unless you already have one of the item or you are about to reset. The hero can't die, but he can fail the mission - resulting in him just wasting time. In roughly 2 of 3 cases he will succeed and grant a small bonus to your colony then.You unlock the keep later where you can get Covinari. Those are freelancers like the hero, but give a permanent bonus and malus to the colony. I prefer the 10 percent more production but 10 percent higher food costs for population. They level up over time and can unlock extra bonuses for your colony, including their main bonus - but not malus - being multiplied.Culture increases your happiness by using - but not spending - part of your civilization score to host festivals, which in turn raises production and later birth rates.The military finally lets you draft soldiers and specialize them. Unspecialized soldiers are gained by drafting or by losing specialized soldiers - a very beneficial system that makes sure you only lost resources but not population. You can conquer other cities - at the beginning you want to conquer the tier 1 cities, but after a few colonies you can have a military big enough to start with the best cities already and conquer everything. Specialized soldiers come in melee and ranged, where usually ranged deals the damage and melee tanks. You will want to only recruit the highest available tier, as the others just do less but cost less resources.There is a marketplace which I think is unlocked by a perk and lets you trade resources 50:1, but with some buildings this gets down to 1:1. This is pretty useful to create more buildings, which you should always do before resetting. Each building gives civilization points, and I think so also does each population.Unfortunately, my place runs out here. The game is played with the mouse, keyboard shortcuts exist, and I recommend it to any idle game fan!"

The thing I like about Idle Civilization is the lack of excessive clicking.At the start you will need to click for about 20 times to get a few starter resources, From then on workers do the rest of the work.It's got a great Event system and an interesting research tree for progression.Still, I feel that the world map and hero system could be improved a little.At the time of writing this review I have roughly 15 hours spent active ingame, Sending my hero on adventures and soldiers out to collect books or concur cities.The map seems to be limit to the point that once you've taken all the cities then all you can do is upgrade a few things and collect resources from them.Id like to see some sort of system where the AI tries to reclaim the cities, And you need to station units to protect them.Your main village also has walls that you can build, Only thing that really does any damage is Wolves that take down 1-2 walls every attack. These attacks are rare so if you build 100 walls then you can go 15 hours and only lose 3 walls.Other than that it's a great Idle game, Good for a few days of gameplay.Id rate this game 8/10 and recommend it to any Idle gamers."

Your civilization is hidden behind the crafting screen which I didn't like, and the early game consists of clicking on just a few resources and managing what your population does.Yes, I know this is what all idle games are about.  But I just didn't feel the excitement for IC early game like I did for others such as Adventure Capitalist, which is free btw.IC is actually free on Kongregate but the dev will be adding most of the love to the Steam version.  He needs to pay for new music and a few new systems.Later on you can build troops and attack npc villages.  This can be a bit exciting until you mis-gauge the strength of the village you're attacking and lose all your troops.  Unlike most online strategy games, IC doesn't tell you the strength of the village you're attacking.  This can lead to frustration as you lose an attack and have to spend another 10 minutes amassing an army again.In my opinion, the dev should spend most of the money this game has made on better presentation.  Right now, it looks like a children's coloring book and consists of just a few screens of UI.  The game is only a 17.8 mb file.According to steamspy, this game sold pretty well and has a decent player base.  I refunded though because I was just bored throughout.  A bit slow initially building farms and resources buildings.  Also listening to the same music track loop over and over gets tedious.  The dev says he will also be replacing that, which is a great thing.  I just dont think IC is worth 5 bucks unless you enjoy playing these idle games for only 15 minutes at a time while you scan the news feeds.  Which, is what these games are all about anyway."

It's a different take on the genre, while employing essentially all of the same old mechanics. It also introduces a few new ones.However, it is still an idle clicker. You're running a land by clicking on stuff to make numbers get bigger. Build more houses (by clicking on buttons) to get more people. Assign those people to gathering various resources. Use those resources to build more stuff.I'm a little undecided on the graphics, but there *is* a somewhat charming early-90s / late 80s style to them.I look forward to further development on this game and feel it was worth the five bucks for what is already there -- again, if you're the kind of jerk who likes idle clickers... like me."

It's slow at first, but it starts to stack up over time. It's not like the other ones, i.e. Tap Heroes, Clicker Heroes, or Sakura Clicker, it's more like Adventure Capitalist where you sit and gradually upgrade your mineral per second. I recommend this to those who want something to check on every now and then, or play while watching a TV show or binge watching YouTube.Edit: The music also sounds like old school Runescape, that's just my opinion.Edit 2: With the update that fixed minor things, it seemed to have gotten a bit better. I, honestly, enjoy the new wage system. Just be careful, if you type in ""100"", it'll get rid of all your coins per second.Edit 3: After playing over a hundred hours, I can honestly say this is the best clicker/idle game I've played, it's really quite enjoyable. It's not too clicky or too grindy, you can even restart every 30 minutes if you gain enough culture points (One Civilization Point per 125 Culture) in a short amount of time."

,Not Recommended,418910,29743012,Posted: 6 February,all,IIIStrife,"This game hasn't updated in so long, and honestly, it needs to do so.What you have here is a much different clicker experience. It's really like Adventure communist (which this came before btw) in that you have multiple different resources, but unlike that, each building costs a specific resource, but each one you can alsi immdeiately gather manually. Only, one resource you cannot gather, is population, which also must be allocated between each resource in order to idly gather it. Population requires food, and room, whihc is increased via houses.After building enough structures, you gain the ability to start building an army, which is used for exploration (random bonuses and resources can be gained from these, depending on how many troops or people you send exploring), and raiding NPC villages and towns of varying and scaling difficulty and strength, (for a special resource which you can use to build monuments).You can prestige by creating a new colony, after doing so, you have Civilization Points which you can use to spend on perks. Standard fare for the most part.The game itself is pretty good, it's a nice breath of fresh air from the somewhat monotony that clicker games essentially are suffering from (what with the clones of clicker heroes which barely have any difference and all).Things it could help to have added:- Multiplayer Raids- Some kind of Guild system where you launch joint-attacks on massive fortresses for special artifacts with help from other players.- Tougher NPC towns for when you have literally thousands of Templars- NPC Towns that scle based on the number of Colonies you've built.- NPC Raids upon your town, Walls are basically useless. Or more tougher raids.- Leaderboards.Right now, I can't recommend the game as I just have no interest in it right now. Sadly, it doesn't have much in the way of end-game content and is a bit incomplete for hte time being. With any hope, it'll get updated more with more content, features, but right now, just don't bother.If I gave a rating, I'd give it a 5/10 honestly.

It was a bit overwhelming at first, as I wasn't completely clear on how things related to each other. A couple of hours later, I was playing like a pro and already dreaming up strategies to get further and further.Play a little, idle a lot, idle a little, play a lot.One of the nicest things about Idle Civilizations is that it doesn't leave you idling for hours, waiting for things to do. If you want to setup a good idle build, you can do that, but you can also sit at the computer and do quests, raids, exploration, or just plain development, while you wait for resources to build.This is perhaps one of the best things about the game, is that it can feel completely like a strategy game if you want it to, or a clicker idle game if that's what you'd prefer.Either way, this game is definitely worth the very generously low asking price.A must buy for clicker fans"

There are too many resources, too many tabs, too many notifications, and the UI is cluttered and hard to read to boot. I found myself making comparisons to Anti-Idle, my first game of the genre. It too had a ton of stuff to do, but each activity was separate and had a lot more user interaction. Also, it was free.So to sum things up, there are better, free idle games that feel more polished and are easier for some quick relaxation."

However there is no real sense of progression as some basic expected functions are hidden behind a very expensive buildings.Graphics 4/10:Despite retro looks the game is actually quite ugly. There is something both in the colony map and in the world map, that puts me off - lack of colour, area design perhaps?Interface is clunky and cramped, research matrix is barely readable, tavern screen has popup covering some of your heroes making navigation difficult, etc etc.Audio 4/10:Apparently music was supposed to be next large update to the game. Right now it's just few annoying loops and whooshing sounds. Monotonous, boring, but there are  option settings for volume and muting!Gameplay 6/10:It's difficult sometimes to understand why incremental games are so popular.This one clearly has little to it, as the massive increase in amounts is not really offset by skills/techs or other things like that. I am not sure how on earth I would ever get 100 000 000 people without leaving game running with CE speedhack for weeks.One thing that is good however are somewhat nice Hero Quests and Rare Sightings. These are creative and fun to read, but their number is limited.Conclusion:Buy only on sale or if real fan of idle games. There is maybe like two dozen hours of action before you get bored to death like me."
,Not Recommended,418910,30273010,Posted: 1 March,all,DatrixTHLK,"Updated review: I quote this line that the dev said it was or should have been out:Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?“At most, two months. So sometime at the end of January, Idle Civilization should be out of EA.”How long ago was this game released? When was this information put out? Why is it still not out of EA? Where is the dev? I haven't heard anything from them in such a long time. I already have expected the worst. Sadly, this game isn't worth 5 dollars. It is worth 1 dollar at the most with how it looks right now.I can't say for sure that this is a cash grab, but until the dev starts talking to us and communicating a little more REGULARLY, then it is safe to say this is a cash grab game just like starforge, just like Turret Architect (only one or two updates then boom dev vanished), just like Runescape Idle Adventures (even though that was free), just like clicker guild (even though that game itself was free), just like Heroes of Might and Magic VI (because I couldn't ever get that game to work on my PC even though I have the correct specs for it and then some) Just like Sweatshop (because the dev their has abandoned that game since they don't know how to fix anything wrong with their own game). I could go on and on, but I'm not this is what happens when you pay for things in early access. My advice is to stay as far away as you can from early access games until they are fully released, then you'll know for sure if the dev has abandoned the games or not.Review: As far as I can see this game is still in early access when it should have been out of that a long time ago. It was fun for a while, but it gets boring after playing it time after time not doing anything different than the last time.I can't really tell what needs work, but since it has been 7 months since the last update on this game one can only assume it has been abandoned. Therefore, I cannot recommend this game until the devs come back and work on it until it comes out of early access. Don't buy this game whatever the cost is. Wait for this game to finish or come out of EA.Don't mind this: Unless you want to...Valve seriously needs to change their policy on how long games that have been in early access and abandoned should stay on steam such as a three month period of time and then after that point if the dev fails to put up an update on the game page saying they are still alive should delete the game off of steam and refund money that was paid towards the devs creating said game."

I regularly play grand stragtegy games and the like and  I'm constantly on the look out for 'kingdom/empire building games similar to this. I very much enjoy games that provide me with the extreme statistics that this game provides eg many hundeds-thousands-millions-billions-trillions etc. Of said resources. I'm enjoying the style and the UI is fine.It's a very simple game but has a lot to offer. It's simple but offers a satisfying amount of depth and/but with little complexity. It's very much a 'click game' as it's title suggests. Being early access I find myself being quite patient and still considering it's pros and cons.I love the adventurer/hero extention. Gives the kingdom building a more personal/rpg feel.The game for me is kind of reminiscent of 'kings of dragon pass' which was a totally  wonderful game but I had a few hang ups which I found lacking for the game I wanted to play.All that being said, I only have a few issues/wishes right now:1st: I would like the world map to be bigger... MUCH bigger.Considering the staggering numbers of people/tropps/resources etc that you can acquire, it would make for a much better kingdom/empire building game we could have a considerably larger world to conquer/explore/trade with.2nd: Although there is a quite deep research tech tree with many techs to research, I would like it to be bigger/have more options.3rd: I would like a slightly deeper/more indepth dimplomacy/trade system. Just more options really.Sadly, that's it for now. Still, great little game.I pray that future updates are not just tweaking and bug fixing but expanded content, similar to the above mentioned etc... Keep up the good work."

I stopped playing after I reformatted my computer and basically forgot it existed. And then I ran back into it on steam. I hesitated to buy it, because I could originally play for free on Kong - but I decided to go ahead and support the dev and buy the game. It's about 5 bucks, and really it's worth it to me.Yes, this is an idle game - but there is a lot to do actively, if you're willing to spend time on it. Moreover the game is being expanded pretty constantly - it doesn't look like much now, but as an early access player you can help shape the game into something even better.If idle and incremental games are your thing, this is quite a nice title that is still being expanded. It's different than games like Clicker Heroes - But that's part of its charm, too."

Expand to next city and get bonuses. Use said bonuses to help with next city. Fun part is just building up military and letting them crush other towns and pay you tribute. With it being early access right now it is great. I do hope that they toss in a couple more features for when the game is fully ready.Only changes I would make are that when you move to a new colony the cost for new citizens for food doesn't reset and that is a little annoying. Easy work around is to save and reopen. Secondly whenever you load up your game you military auto defaults back to 50. this back fires if you have the draft option clicks and it starts drafting people down to 50 when you previously had it set for something much higher.
