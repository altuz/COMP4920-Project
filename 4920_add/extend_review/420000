Yes and no. Read on for more info.Since they don't show you a full-screen screenshot, you can't see how badly the texture qualities are. Many of the textures go onto surfaces wrong and you can't correct it either. If you're thinking of buying this for fun, then you're probably better off just buying the Sims.Update: If you are buying it for fun (as opposed to professional reference and useage) then you would be better off to buy the game I mentioned. There are other tools like this one out there that you can get for free and this one in particular is also available on iOS and Android from what I've read.There is no denying the tools usefulness, but better textures and more customization items would be good too. But that's me being picky.Can you lay out a room plan with this product?Yes.You can work to accurate measurements based on your room. The tool does what it's for, but it could have been improved upon.There are 10 items in Home Design 3D which are unlocked via liking the Dev's Facebook page.And since a commenter asked me to suggest any other programs that do the same or better, there is  a program called Sweethome 3D. It's the only one I recall the name of right now, but there are android apps and according to one of the other reviews here, Home Design 3D here is a port from that app. Wether it costs on the appstore or not I can't tell you, but if you Google for home design or interior design apps, a few recommended apps come up above the rest of the results.If you're willing to do a few Googles or search the Android and Apple App stores, you'll come across programs much like this and save yourself some money."

The only solution is to close the program and re-open.I might as well usePaint.NETto draw my flat.Note: I didn't spend 8 hours on this program. I simply have it minimized for 7.5 hours.Edit: This program has a functionality to split walls under ""Create a new angle"" option. This can help with creating more complex rooms. The developers also seem pretty active in addressing concerns for now. I am willing to withdraw this negative review if the program improves substantially after a few patches."

Can't manually enter the length of a wall or window, so it's kinda tedious to set a wall to a specific length (14'10"", 15'2"", 14'11"",15'3"",14'8"", etc).  Can't copy items so if I want the same window in every room, I have to drag and resize each one separately.  Probably most important, there is no support for roofs.

Shift+click does not let you select multiple walls. Shift+move does not allow you to adjust an entire room keeping its original proportions. Instead you move one corner of the room regardless of which command key you press while moving a corner, making it impossible to easily manipulate rooms. You cannot place a room inside of another room, meaning that you have to put up individual walls, which also is not easy. You put up one wall with the intended length, and then the wall next to it magnet clips onto the INSIDE edge, meaning you have to add half the width of your wall to the length of the wall you're currently placing. This occurs irrespective of your choice of magnet clipping in the settings option. It should connect to the outside edge of the wall so that your inside measurement stays the same (this is particularly important for odd widths of walls since you cannot make walls through half inch intervals). To make matters worse, once two walls have connected against your will, they still have two different drag points, so moving the corner does not move both walls, once again making it impossible to easily adjust corners. Additionally, measurements do not update as you're dragging the wall, so you have to guess where the right placement is. Never purchase this program. Zero thought went into its production. Right clicking does nothing, when it could have added additional functionality. They obviously wanted the program to be highly flexible, but then don't make easy alternatives to painstaking and difficult modifications. Shift, cntrl, right click, any of these could have been utilized to successfully create a program that is both flexible and easy. They had obviously never used Photoshop or GIMP, which both have incredibly intuitive interfaces, from which these programmers could have learned. This program is a prime example of why you need not just UI programmers, but UX experts who design the program for the UI programmers to realize. 0/10."

Everything is scalable and movable but the stand alone walls and the lot itself. It's easy to customize textures and the walk through is a nice touch. I love how it goes from blueprint to 3d models. This is the building app I've been looking for my game/comic/book reference!Things I would like to see.========================More cabinets, especially upper ones. Not all overhead cabinets are the same size, some, like over the sinks are often only half, even with the top of them, allowing for plenty of sink room. I had to use a spice rack to stand in for mine.Seasonal decorations like a Christmas tree. When I was doing the living room I had to use a pine tree.Scaleable stand alone walls and lots.Exact sizing entry. I might have missed this but I don't see a way to say a room is 12x12 or a lot is 100x50 anywhere.Able to move the whole house around on the lot (or lot under the house) for precise placement.Microwaves and the like as separate props, with surface snapping. Not everyone uses counters as the microwave placement. I have an old desk, due to not having enough counter space.Multiple floor support.

Its done as though it was a rush port over from and android app and it works simular and it has absolutly no functionality in wich a personal computer was ment for.

I cam place it, I can change the size of it I can change the width of it and I can even change the height of it.. But I cannot change the view angle at wich it is mounted on the wall.. only good for simple design ideas only, this program has no fuacility to house any real architecture or blue printing capabilities, nor could it even be close to an engineering plan. you could make a rough picture with this, but it takes way to long to enter all the measurements to make it worth it becuase you cant enter fractions of an inch to be correct and in MOST designs- require much percision  or the whole plan will be changed. so its faster to draw it on paper and hand it to an architect. it has no facilities for electrical, plumbing, foundation, ventilation, heating, insulation, roof work, crawl spaces or attic accesses. does not take into account vaulted ceilings half doors, or trim/brickmolding or crown molding, light switches, electrical outlets, breaker box and cleanout drain or anything exterior. the selection of appliances is appauling and it is MOST certainly NOT worth to buy or the time to enter the measurements , in fact the The SIMS 3 ingame builder FAR more sophisticated and is cheaper to buy, easier & quicker to use.

In fact, that can be quite nice. My problem, however, was mostly in my work with scale.  I'd chalk it up to a lack of ability to learn this, save for having used similar CAD's in the past. A walkthrough as if talking to a toddler for a small, one-bedroom flat/apartment might have been nice, explaining the scope of size, especially. My projects had a tendency to be large and, if I'm honest, I wanted to add in secret passages throughout, too. I thought it would be fun.For what it is as a progrm, I give it an 7 because it DOES what it needs to, just not easily or in a very user-friendly manner.Audi: 0 - I can't recall audio at all.Graphics: 9 - They all looked wonderful, but like something out of a Homes and Gardes magazine. 10 other than that, though.If you want to try your hand at building a .... well, building, or your own dream home, this is a good place to start (don't expect professioal items such as electrical or plumbing options, where to place your frame work, etc.Still, all that negativity aside, it's still a bit on the fun side when in the mood for it.-Paladeus"

I assume everything is to scale, so there is some basic merit to planning out your dream home - especially if you are nowhere near the stages of building it. While THE SIMS has the monopoly on furnishings and whatnot, you can get a basic idea of dimensions, measurements and by the time you're ready to splurge on actual design software, you should have a good handle on both your ideas and how to operate the program.The program is simple, honestly too simple to use for my tastes, keeping menus and text to a minimum and having de/selection based around double clicking. Fine for 2D design, but when your software has a complex component like 3D building, your interface should keep up with the change in complications.Bottom line - Not worth the 10 bucks it usually goes for.

,Not Recommended,420000,35465316,Posted: 4 October,all,Fishbits,"While this is amusing for the purpose of playing around, it's plagued with bugs, poor coding decisions, and is a right mess. Command keys such as Delete will just stop working randomly, wall placement and movement will randomly decide whether it wants to move the wall, move the wall and everything attached to it, move the wall but angle everything attached to it, et cetera, and object scaling will randomly decide whether to scale only the side you move, or to scale both sides at once. There doesn't appear to be a way to manually enter the scale of objects, and speaking of scale, EVERYTHING in the menus for objects is dead wrong, in terms of scale. Cabinets do not fit standard scale for pretty much anything, every fridge is exactly the size fridges aren't, the doors are all wrong, the stairs are a waking nightmare, and I've yet to see a couch that isn't a bad joke. Wall height can only be adjusted in certain places, and there's no way to cap reduced-height walls, there's no shelf-fill, there's no ceiling option, and ""rooms"" properly ""Fill"" the floor and ceiling themselves only about 50% of the time, ultimately filling a floor that cannot be split, so if your ""room"" initializes improperly across multiple spaces, or a wall is put in after the fact, the wall you attach it to will split, but the floor will not.Ultimately I think this utility could be interesting. Maybe with a LOT more work, and perhaps a team to go over this sort of thing to ensure proper scaling, and proper fitting of pretty much everything involved(Including fixing the default wall thickness, as only masonry walls typically hit the 8 inch mark). But as it stands right now? It's a cesspit in dire need of a floor-to-ceiling rework.Assuming the ceiling even fills in properly."

Not sure about the £6.99 price tag but upon use, the application appears very sophisticated and easy to use. I use a mix of keyboard/mouse and touchscreen devices. Despite it being easier on a keyboard and mouse, the touchscreen use in this app still worked inuitively. The application is not for professional use, despite some reviewers writing reviews as if it was. Granted the application is not perfect and the choice of furnishings and objects is lacking heavily with minimal choices. However, this app is a life-saver when redesigning a room or a house and beats the old pencil and paper method as the digital version can be shared across devices through steam and screenshot images.I have used this application on multiple projects at redesigning rooms and at work and it has impressed many people."

Switching to back and fort between 2D/3D views is very smooth and fast. Navigation works. One other thing that makes usage even easier; language support. For Even Finnish.It has some issues with selection stuff though. Sometimes area screens down to red marginal and stays there. Something it shouldn’t be doing on it’s own. In 3D view sometimes the image angle bends objects into interesting abstract shapes.Wish there was variety of European windows and door types too.

,Recommended,420000,34435154,Posted: 23 August,all,EagleC,"OK, so first off this is not a game. It's not meant to be a game and if you want a game then try something else.If you want to redesign your kitchen, plan an extension or create a fantasy home then this program does the job. It's pretty easy to use and has a range of furniture and decor so you can complete your look. I created my entire house in this app on the iPad and used it to plan redecorating and other home improvement projects.Recently I have purchsaed the PC version and imported my ipad plans. I have then used it to plan out an extension and new kitchen - although we still needed to hire a professional to draw up the plans for the extension I was able to run through a lot of ideas myself before we got him in and it helped to communicate what we wanted. It also helped plan the kitchen units with my wife.One problem is that this app appears to be tailored towards the US appliances and building standards. Furniture common in the UK is not always available and sizes are not UK standards. It would be fantastic if there was a B&Q, Homebase or Ikea catalogue download.Also the last ipad version I used allowed you to set wall height and I have not located this option on the PC. As most post war built houses in the UK have a ceiling of 2.3m rathere than the app standard 2.5m this can make rooms look very different expecially when placing taller or wall mounted furniture. Also you can't build an upstairs.All that said, for under £10 this application is well worth it for any home improvement enthusiast looking for a way to plan and preview before starting a project."
