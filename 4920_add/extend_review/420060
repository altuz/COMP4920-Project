,Recommended,420060,30007822,Posted: 18 February,all,Lucky Shot,"Thank you,  Teku Studios and Daedalic Entertainment, for this masterpiece! That's what a good adventure looks like. The soundtrack and the music are extremely good and I wouldn't be able to choose better ones for this game. The puzzles aren't that difficult (moderate difficulty), but the problem was finding some items that were hidden pretty well (I'm not trying to spoil anything, but they were hidden in places you couldn't even think). This hand-painted game is extremely beautiful and never ceases to amaze you with its wonderful sceneries. The storyline is well-thought-out and educational, it can never get you bored, and it makes you want to find out what'll happen next. There's nothing to think about before buying this game - just buy it, because you can hardly find better adventure games these days. This game is a hidden gem!"

The artwork looks like Don't Starve and Machinarium, while the gameplay feels more like Limbo and Machinarium. Candle has a much more ""open world"" feel to it for a puzzler since you're not confined to one particular scene at a time to complete the puzzles and move onto the next. It has full controller support with very simple UI/controls that never feel frustrating unlike many of these types of games. As far as the visuals go, it's by far one of the best games I've played in terms of the designs/coloring/style. Definitely worth picking this one up."

This game is more frustrating than fun."
76561198135649740,Recommended,420060,33543236,Posted: 14 July,all,awakenedmind,"There's something really amazing about this game. A quality that extends beyond the art, which is truly astonishing. Hand-painted in its entirety, I cannot recall having played any other game with such an aesthetic quality and attention to detail. The story telling is masterfully crafted as well, drawing from South American (and possibly Latin American) folklore. For most western audiences these tales will hold a special mythic place, as there seems to be very little media drawing from these beautiful ancient cultures.Gameplay is of the standard puzzle-platformer style with movement and jumps registering well, once you become used to it, which can seem a bit ""laggy"" at times. I think this was probably a design choice by the team, as the protagonist of the adventure is not really a fighting type, rather he is a problem solver and storyteller.I really love this game, and expect I will probably play it several times over, if only to enjoy the artwork again and again.Having said that, I would caution anyone playing this game that the puzzles are unusually difficult. It's not really that the puzzles are unduly complex or anything, but many of the clues provided are so subtle as to be almost opaque, and very little context is provided to assist the player. I've prided myself over the course of 30 some odd years of never using guides to progress through games, especially when puzzles are involved. Having completed all of the additional puzzle content in Assassin's Creed 2 without assistance, approximately 95% of the Proffesor Layton puzzles, Zelda, no guides, Metroid, no guides, Zork, no guides, Portal Challenges, no problem, and the list goes on. When it comes to Candle, there was just no way I was gonna find/figure out some of the missing items or puzzles. A stain on my puzzle pride! LOL!There are points in which some items needed to prgress the story are simply not mentioned at all, and are very well hidden. This could be a strength for the player that completely explores each and every environment, but the platforming in this game doesn't really support that kind of gameplay. It might also be a strength if the exploration led to shortcuts, or additional content that simply added to the game (or story), rather than necessary for progression.Perhaps it is Candle's stroytelling that drove me to progress as quickly as I could, eschewing exploration becuase I truly felt the survival of my tribe depended on me. I've not considered it before now, but perhaps...I'm now 8 hours and 3 acts in, and will update my review once I've completed the game. For now though I gotta say I'm pretty amazed.Completion Edit: Candle's resolution is absolutely perfect and in alignment with the aesthetic and feel of the game as a whole. I really wish there had been more to the game, more art, more adventure, more of Candle. Nonetheless a great game overall, and I hope to see more from Teku Studios in the future."

The voice acting, of which there isn't a lot, is pretty good and the story is told in an interesting manner. I found the puzzles to not quite hit the mark for me. Some of them were in my view really esoteric which had me going to youtube after a while, while others were too easy. That being said I found some of them entertaining, but I won't go into spoilers.Candle sometimes require you to make well-timed jumps and actions which I found unfair to ask of the player due to the slightly imprecise controlls and especially awkward jumping mechanic. The cycles of enemies whom were to be avoided in order to complete a puzzle was often too slow, which left you just standing and gazing to the, albeit beautiful, scenery while waiting for your slot.If the puzzles and the controls were made tighter and more enjoyable, Candle would most definately be a 7 or 8/10 for me. Still recommend it for the views."
,Recommended,420060,33417831,Posted: 9 July,all,Queen Vakarian,"Wonderful game! Definitely makes you think (or use guides because who likes thinking =p). It's absolutely gorgeous to look at! The art alone made dying in this game something you could deal with. Normally I get frustrated with myself for making stupid mistakes, but the art kept me calm! Controls felt really good and it was enjoyable with not having any real combat throughout the game. This game is worth taking the few hours or so to play. Oh! And the story. It's certainly relatable and overall is quite dark for such a beautiful game. I enjoyed the story and lesson it gave. Great great game!"

The ca.10 hrs' gameplay to some extent cured my years of hand-eye coordination problem. Teku studios have done a great job :)"
,Recommended,420060,26604512,"Posted: 14 November, 2016",all,PhD.Q,"Stunningly beautiful hand-drawn puzzle-platformer and one of the loveliest adventure game I played in my life. I love the graphics, the music, the puzzles and, what is most important to me, rhytm and pacing. The puzzles were challenging at some points but never seemed too easy. It is totally worth full price and the only thing I regret is missing a chance to back this up years ago on Kickstarter.Thank you Teku Studio!Can't wait to hear from you again!"

Like an old school point and click adventure, with many of the frustrations of random clicking avoided. Best played with a controller."

,Recommended,420060,26688552,"Posted: 19 November, 2016",all,bagel.rabbit,"--FULL DISCLAIMER: I haven't played the entire game yet.--Candle is the type of game that could have only been created by a tiny indie game team. It has tremendous warmth and vibrancy, brought about in large part by its artstyle. The artstyle is the first thing I noticed and the biggest thing that stuck with me. I could talk about it for hours, but I won't. You'll just have to see it yourself. Sorry.This art compliments a world where carefully-crafted puzzles can confuse and delight. While the game became exasperating at times, it was never truly frustrating: the puzzles are difficult but fair, and the lack of time-limits and abundance of autosaves meant none of my hard-fought progress went to waste.There are a few nits I could pick - I found some occasional minor bugs, the character dialogs took too long for my taste, and the English translation had some minor stumbles - but these didn't detract from the core and the spirit of the game, and they didn't detract from my enjoyment. In a world of indie developers releasing alphas, betas, and DLC after DLC, Candle stands out. It is a whole game, a complete game, and a lovely game. Candle glows. Buy it."

76561198071061095,Recommended,420060,33652838,Posted: 19 July,all,FilthWizard,"Got this game in a Daedalic Publisher pack during the 2017 summer sale with the assumption it would be a Point&Click adventure game. It is not. But you know what else it isn't? Bad.This game is a platformer [note: I played it using a keyboard] that tells a story which rivals any Point&Click adventure. The game isn't exactly hard past the first half hour or so after you familiarized yourself with the drawing style. Yeah I jumped into one particular chasm a few times because I couldn't tell what was an eligible ledge I could jump on and what was just background art...but you won't encounter that problem often.The gameplay mechanics are basic platformer ones, jump from A to B and solve some puzzles. The titular candle will help you in this as it is used to reveal hidden puzzles, fight enemies and activate central gameplay elements. You could say it is about keeping your candle burning throughout bad conditions. Overall the storyline is fantasy-like with a vibe of tribal stuff like Aztec or made up Amazonian lore.If you get this in the Daedalic Artists bundle don't be discouraged! Even if it isn't a Point&Click adventure it is still a very nice story and easy yet challenging platformer. The puzzles should be hard yet fair enough for any Point&Click Adventure gamer and the platformer parts are easy enough even for novice platformer gamers. I'd say if you ever played a 2D Super Mario game you will be more than Ok in the platforming sequences of this game. On the other hand the puzzles are a tad more obscure and you may get frustrated if you have no prior Point&Click Adventure experience.Recommended at full price if the screenshots and videos on steam are making you itch to play it. Recommended on sale if you dig a good story, some platforming and puzzles...and the art style!"
,Recommended,420060,34355465,Posted: 19 August,all,kojul,This game is a great blend of a point and click adventure and a platformer. The puzzles are nice and the in game dialog is interestingly conveyed through pictograms. I bought this game for the aesthetic and stuck around for the gameplay.
