,Not Recommended,420070,20178753,"Posted: 1 January, 2016",all,kriptosporidium,"The idea is solid, and it looks alright, but it lacks polish. The controls are sluggish and unresponsive, the physics are pretty janky, and although these is somewhat mitigated by the fact that you can instantly reset a stage whenever you want, restarting can also screw with you because your controls sometimes just don't work for a few moments after you restart, which is frustrating when you get to some later levels that require essentially perfect execution to get a full score, which is hard enough with the game controlling the way it does. Predicting the Plumber's path can be difficult at times, because his timing seems to be somewhat inconsistent in relation to your position, although that might have been me not being accustomed enough to the game. The music gets grating after a while, too.Also, whatever you do, do not alt-tab the game (at least if you're in fullscreen). I made the mistake of alt-tabbing, which caused the game to completely lock me out, and after I had to shut it down and restart it, I lost all of the progress I made up to that point. This happened twice, because I guess I don't learn from my own mistakes.I'm not saying the game should be completely avoided, there's some fun to be had with it, and as I said, the core idea is good enough to carry it. But in it's state right now, it plays like a mess and feels unrefined."

The real truth about a familiar plumber is revealed in this game, but i don't wish to spoil it. Before i posted what this spoiler was in my review, and im sorry for this whoever read it.One thing about this game is it seems to short. Most of the ""levels"" involve one screen maps where you control the monster on it and try to kill the plumber in various semi puzzle situations. There are also secret endings..one of them is quite funny.I recommend this game for original idea about playing the baddies to protect the princess."
,Recommended,420070,20203980,"Posted: 1 January, 2016",all,Joys,"If you have ever wanted to be on the enemy's side on a platform game, this is it. And it works great.Save your kingdom from a maniac, princess-stalking plumber who's on a brainless roll. Control several different enemies, often more than one at once. Kill, survive, drop him off the screen, even be a big boss. You get to beat him in many different scenarios, and the faster you do it, the better rating (from 0 to 3 stars).Truth be told, this is a puzzle game. You need to figure out how to (usually) kill the plumber, which is solving the puzzle. You get lots of puzzles, each with a twist. There's a difficulty curve so you feel the progression. Controls have great response, the plumber always behaves as it should (nothing erratic), and the mechanics are easy to grasp. There are bonus levels in each of the three worlds that are a lot harder, and there is also a time-attack for all the stages in each world. Achievements are included!The game looks spot-on considering it's classic platformer theme. It's theme is a parody, so characters are easily recognizeable with their similarities. The interface does it's simple job efficiently, It's easy and really quick to go from levels to options to achievement room (it looks obvious when you play it, which is the point: it's well designed). Art style doesn't look too cartoony nor too stiff.I've been having a great time with it. I barely ever play single player games, but this one reeled me in. Some more bang to your buck than usual. If you like it's idea, killing the plumber in memorable moments, I deffinetly recommend it."
,Recommended,420070,33109260,Posted: 1 July,all,Tmast98,"Had a blast with this game.  Although sort, the conept behind the game is pretty hilarious.  The game is a nice mix between a platformer and a puzzle game, reuqiring you to utilize the enemies at your dispsal to kill the plumber.  The game only suffers from a few levels where collecting all of the optional stars requires some unintuitive use of the terain or enemies available.  For a casual player, you will likely not experience this.I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys platformers and puzzle games, while not looking for anything that requires intense levels of skills or a significant time investment."

You control the typical bad guy to get the typical good guy, but there is more to it than that.The game isn't super deep, but they have tried to create a retelling of the story that helps to keep things moving, plus the developers have included ""cheat"" codes from classic games that alter how it plays. These codes don't nessesarily give you and advantage, and play out more like easter eggs most of the time, but that is part of the games charm.The developer's also seem to be active on the discussion board, often asking for community input to make the game better.I really don't think you can go wrong with this one."

Ha 3rd world problems are apparently the most popular. I don't really suggest this unless you really want achievements and a quick fun game

Roy,"Kill The Plumber is a unique qucik reaction puzzle that has you kill the plumber with different minions in different enviroments. When you play the game you will have to react or be patient and wait for your opprotunity to strike. The only down side is this game is short, as in it only as a few levels. I will say that there is less than 4 levels or so and I was hoping the game would last longer, but it doesn't. The good thing is this game is a quick game that makes you feel like you accomplished it."

,Not Recommended,420070,20240548,"Posted: 2 January, 2016",all,Apoch Weiss | Apochs.net,"Quick Review: Obviously a Super Mario Bros parody with incredibly slow moving levels broken up into 30 small ""stages"" in four larger chunks per world (four worlds total). Best example is the game 'Spoiler Alert', but with a little more variety than just one character going backwards and having to avoid obstacles. 'Kill the Plumber' tries to take on modern slivers of gaming for those with ADHD when it comes to gaming, and it just turns the original successful formula into something sluggish, boring, and completely uninspiring, all for a higher cost than the original app version just because it's on Steam and has Steam achievements.I think Charlie Day sums up my reaction to this game about fifteen minutes in:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FYTc55nGEII can't say it's worth putting in for a refund over. Collecting dust in the library? Yes. Will I play it once in a while? Probably. Overall, another mobile app on the marketplace that had potential to be something good, but just doesn't deliver."

Some mechanics seem a little unpolished, but this gream is REALLY fun.Kill the Plumber takes a new perspective on platformer games, where the generic hero (Mario) is the villain, and you must control the minions on each level to kill him. It took a lot of thinking for some levels, and a lot of trial and error, but no level I tried was impossible.As it is now, a 9/10 for concept, 7/10 for art, 7/10 gameplay, and 6/10 polish.

Each level is short, although some of the more frustrating ones may take many tries to complete. It's a good game for those who enjoy striving for impeccable timing. I enjoyed this form for taking short breaks from work, as the game doesn't demand too much investment at any particular time.The controls are playable, although not optimal, and some of the challenge of the game comes from dealing with this imprecision. The game is also relatively short, and replayability seems limited. But still a fun one for the library given the price."

,Recommended,420070,33299893,Posted: 5 July,all,stufff,"I wasn't sure whether to recommend this game or not because it is very flawed, but ultimately I had several hours of fun with it and I only paid a few bucks so I feel I got my money's worth.The concept is great, play as the bad guys in a classic platformer. The execution is not so great though. Some levels are less about figuring out the puzzle and more about trial and error over and over again until you figure out the sometimes pixel perfect timing. There was one level in particular that I knew what to do in, but I literally couldn't press the correct sequence of buttons that perfectly in so short a time and it took me way too long.Frustrating moments like that detract from what is otherwise a really fun and unique game.The speedrun levels / achievements are pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t though. Do all the levels perfectly all in a row. Pass."
,Not Recommended,420070,34420377,Posted: 22 August,all,thelemster521,"This game cheats you.Most of its limits are within needlessly strict time limits and there's no chance of getting three stars on most levels unless you time things perfectly- spoiler alert, it'll be a certainly frustrating experience. Though its enemies and their unique playstyles are interesting and make for decent levels, the limits on time are beyond aggravating and it's mostly a mess of hoping you can make things work in time. The plumber's movements are unpredictable and janked, as are the physics. Most levels in general need you to move far too quick for your brain to register, and before you even realize you lost, the level screws you over again.Overall, it was a cool idea, but needs to get its controls and leisure in order; elsewise it's just a stress-heavy reset bonzanza that slowly wears at your mental health."
