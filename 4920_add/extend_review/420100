,Recommended,420100,30771329,Posted: 27 March,all,Z-95,"While nowhere near the masterpiece that Clannad is, the side stories are short glimpses into the characters' lives either before, during, or after some of the different routes of Clannad. Each story lasts about 20 minutes and has no choices (or even interactivity--they are more like a drama CD or image story) and focuses on one or a small few characters from Clannad.Worth reading for fans of Clannad for the extra insight and backstory (and after story for a couple); especially if you are craving more after finishing the main game."

Any fan of the anime or visual novel will love this. There is a ton of original content here that will help bring that world back to life and take you back home to the place in town where wishes come true.

This just scraches the surface, but the lovable individuals and charming dynamics are still there.If you loved CLANNAD, there's no reason not to buy this."

,Recommended,420100,30647650,Posted: 21 March,all,Enter_77,"ProsCharacter perspectives--- Stories narrated by characters other than Clannad's main protagonist is a nice change of pace.Sound design--- Quality sound effects and ambient sound enhance the atmosphere.ConsLack of playback options--- There is no option to advance or view previously displayed text. Instead, text advances as each line completes the audio narration Chapter select is available for each story,  but there is no save feature to return to a specific point.ConclusionThe collection of 16 short stories, each with a runtime of about 20 minutes, retell events before, during, and after the events of Clannad's multiple routes from the perspectives of various characters. None of the stories come close to anything presented in the main visual novel, but they do accent character backstories and even answer some lingering questions.Clannad Side Stories is a linear visual novel with a runtime of about6 hours, though it would be reduced with additional playback support. As a companion piece to the main visual novel, it's not an essential read. Only those that have finished all the routes in Clannad and greatly enjoyed the characters should consider picking it up. Even then,it should only be purchased when it's on salewhen it's heavily discounted orskipped entirely."

Personally, it feels nostalgic to see Akio-san running with Sanae-san's bread, bullied Sunohara, and so on. Botan's side story is so puhi puhi~For the background music, there is no new soundtrack introduced in this one. Nevertheless, it's Clannad-ish so you can expect the power of feels from listening to it.The only drawback is you cannot control the game flow. Once the start button is pressed, you can only pause the game (by using right-click). It's kind of annoying that the subtitle is sometimes stuck because of long texts and you need to click on the screen to continue the subtitle while the narrative keeps playing in the background.In short, ""Clannad Hikari Mimamoru Sakamichi de"" is one of the best collection of side stories out there. If you haven't checked the main Clannad VN, it's obviously suggested to read it before buying this one. Some of the side stories are branched from a certain route in its VN, so it may feel a bit strange if you have only watched the animation without reading those routes in the visual novel."
,Recommended,420100,28882446,"Posted: 31 December, 2016",all,Zakuro Enthusiast,"+ Great OST (most of it is from the original so of course it's great)+ Short stories provide a unique experience that puts you in the shoes of the original Clannad cast (not just Tomoya, there are ""Side Stories"" for everyone, even Botan)+ Characters were mostly written very well, each one encompassing what made them great in the original story despite the game being written by various authors+ The use of sound effects was improved from the original game, very well timed and hilarious+ The stories have a wide range of emotions, the most prominent emotion being heartwarming+ Each story is 20 minutes, so it's very easy to play them sporadically since most of them aren't connected (besides the Baseball and Hot Springs story)+ They elaborate upon some of the ""mysteries"" of the original Clannad and provide answers to those mysteries in very subtle ways, evident in some of the routes if you pay very CLOSE attention to some of the character’s surroundings- This wouldn't be as good of an experience if you didn't play the original prior, Kappei is a VN exclusive character and some plot points very largely unexplored in the original anime (sadly)- The lack of a Kyou After route really leaves a sour taste in my mouth, I would have also LOVED a route that involved Misae and Katsuki together in some form (preferably in the style of the Botan Side Story)- No SAVE function, you must play this game for 20 minutes no matter what and if you should leave, you must let the game REMAIN on if you don't want to lose progress- No CG gallery- The game is on Auto all the time, you don't click to progress, the game does it on its own, this is a bad thing if you want to rush a routeHonestly I'd give this game a 7/10 with only knowledge of the anime while an 8/10 with knowledge of the visual novel, I feel most of the routes despite being good aren't for everyone because they don't provide the same emotional heartbreak that the original provided. The technical flaws are also very noticeable as well as the lack of content (specifically the CG gallery) and the lack of more ""strong"" Side Stories feels like a big hit to what could have been a phenomenal love letter to all Clannad fans. This game is recommended if you played the original but if you're anime only, please play the original and come back to this, it's a worthwhile experience and elaborates upon a bunch of things that the anime didn't. I feel the Ushio route in this game is one of the best things to come out of the series, expertly well written and providing emotions that are extremely unique, putting you further into the mindset of a parent through Tomoya as he has to decide on whether or not he wants Ushio to ""leave"". This is a great experience, just play it if you loved the VN, it's awesome, even if it feels like a missed opportunity that could have been much more..."

I recently finished CLANNAD after story and all scenario's before i started reading this visual novel.The content of this visual novel is mainly just story telling and there aren't any choices, but the content is refreshing and except for the first episode in the visual novel this content is only available in the visual novel and has not been adapted into the anime.So if you are interested in learning more about the clannad universe you should definitely buy this visual novel. I do suggest you first finish the original visual novel or the anime adaptation before playing this however, since the side stories are meant to be read after having read the main story."

I was very excited to see that the side stories had finally been released in english because I've always been curious about them, there's so much content to expand upon from the original VN. I went into this right after my thid read of Clannad so that the story and characters would be fresh in my mind.I hated this. I only got through the first seven stories, but from what I've read the whole thing smells like a cash cow. There's no reason for any of these stories to exist, they don't add any depth to anything from Clannad and they aren't strong plotlines in their own right. They simply take small plot points from the original Visual Novel and draw them out into a half-hour audio drama. We don't need a story about how Tomoyo used to fight people at night in middle school, we already knew that. The only one that was even slightly creative was the Botan storyline, it's pretty fun seeing the Clannad characters from a boar's perspective.The art is amazing, so there's that, but it doesn't count for much when the stories themselves are so dull."

76561198312338619,Not Recommended,420100,29991096,Posted: 17 February,all,♜Poryg♔,"I loved Clannad. It has a great story, etc! So when I saw Clannad on Steam, it was a must to add to wishlist.When I saw that whole Clannad franchise was on sale, I immediately bought it! Clannad, Tomoyo path and this little one. I haven't read the Tomoyo one, but frankly, I have been quite disappointed with this one.First the technical side of the game. There is no main menu. No saves, but the stories are so short that it's irrelevant. Btw. Stories in this collection are so short that even chapters are pretty much irrelevant as well.Also, there are no CGs, so no music collection or anything like that.You have to remember who is talking from voices, since there are no characters shown when someone is speaking.Now for the stories.There are some funny stories. These are good for good laughs. But then there are serious stories... That are very harmed by their short length, because before you can get immersed in them, it's over. And then there are also some mediocre stories.The last thing that hurts the story are inconsistencies between the main Clannad and the side stories. I have found a couple of inconsistencies that seriously harmed the rest from the pleasure I have had reading the stories.Also, a new and unexpected feature, dubbed stories. Even though I don't hate dubbing, the way it has been implemented here is absolutely dreadful!I am very disappointed with the slow and zombie-like narration. It's absolutely annoying. Then there was this difference between Okazaki in Anime and Okazaki in this thing... I mean voice-wise. Pretty disturbing as well.And last but not least, the price. Clannad itself  is pretty expensive. But it's very valuable at the same time and it's worth even the full price. But this? For the price of 20€ it's a total rip-off. I bought this on sale for 8€, but I got something I can pretty much throw into a trash bin after I read it, since the stories have no replay value.Would I recommend it? From 80% sale onwards only."

If you don't love CLANNAD, I'm sorry, but I don't think I can give you an unbiased opinion on whether you should buy CLANNAD Side Stories."

The voices are easy to tell appart and notice right away for anyone who liked the show at least, the art is simple but gives room for the player to still have some imagination influance over the game as if it was an actual book and the chapters can all be accessed in or out of ""order"" from the moment you download the game. Boton even has his own chapter which is ADORABLE btw. If you are a fan or the show Id for sure get it and if you played the game and liked it it'll be a nice continuation to the story looking back on the charactors through the start of the story. (I am extremely bias because I loved the shows, but if you liked is and are thinking this game would be nice to read through I'd say go for it.)"

I'll play it.I was looking for something to fill a bit more of the story left to me by the Clannad anime, and the Visual Novel on Steam. And I did get what I was looking for... but I do have a few difficulties with this particular product.First off, I consider this to be non-canon. There's multiple discrepancies that don't line up with either of the canonical Clannad world, but if you're looking for a few more stories that you can consider optional endings (this is full of epilogues and prequels of stories you've made in the Visual Novel,INCLUDING AFTER STORY. (you can see the names of each of the stories and their narrators in the game preview)Second, it requires you to have already played the Clannad Visual Novel as it's designed for it, or at least have watched the anime, otherwise you won't have any background for the stories. (highly recommending the Visual Novel btw)Note that the first story is almost an exact duplicate of an OVA episode for the anime.If you liked the Visual Novel, loved the series, and are looking for a bit more to fill your heart or the spaces for the stories, I recommend this.Just make sure to keep an open mind,especiallyfor Ushio's story."

I really like the story of how Akio and Sanae met <3There are 16 independent stories, each is narrated by different characters ( including Botan ! ). Each story is short, about 15 minutes. From the technical side, that's a plus because this VN doesn't seem to have some features such as save games and pause between lines.Worth buying if you're really interested more in the Clannad characters, especially during sales ! ( got this at 60% off )"
