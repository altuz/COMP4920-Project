,Recommended,420110,32212467,Posted: 5 June,all,CanadianCannabis,"It's like Nekopara Vol. 1, except you've got more catgirls and less money in your wallet and the dirty sock pile is starting become a mountain by the washing machine and your parents are wondering what you're still doing living at home when you're 26 and the only valuable item you own is a Chun-Li figurine and a bodypillow and your whole life has been a miserable walk of shame being bullied through childhood and never finding your place in the world until you've come to the realization that the only way out might be to commit suicide and leave all the pain on the weight of friends and family who you never bothered to reach out to nor took the time the understand what you meant to them.And then you experience this and all the worries in the world become silent."
,Recommended,420110,21329095,"Posted: 19 February, 2016",all,cyrito,"(Acutal Review BELOW)Showed my parent some gameplay.Dad is proud of me. Mom is not letting me come closer to my little sisters and the cats anymore.10/10 - would make dad proud again.UPDATE: My dad increased my allowance after i patched the game.11/10 - would make mom love me again.Edit: Since most of you want an actual review, I'll give you one. I'm not a professional reviewer or anything, just a simple closet weeb :^)Nekopara is a VN that sets apart other VN on steam, due to it's animation mostly. To me, Nekopara is a nukige because the plots are pretty decent, but the H-scene are what we are here for. So lets break it down part by part.CG/Graphic - This is what makes this game a bit different than other VNs. You don't see many VNs that animates the sprites during conversation, let you pet them and make their ""coconuts"" bounce. I also love the E-MOTES system in Nekopara. The backgrounds and the colours are really lively and heartwarming in a way. So it's a plus in my book.Plot - If you like the plot from Nekopara Vol. 1, you should be fine with this plot but it's a bit shorter. One thing I find lacking in Nekopara are the plot. I understand making a harem + ecchi plot can be difficult because there's a ALOT of VNs out there have the same genre with the same-kind plot. My kind of plot that is to my likings are the Clannad, Grisaia type of plot etc, where they have proper routes and different ending. I think Nekopara is the nukige kind of plot c: . Anyway, I'm pretty sure you guys bought it for the ""plot"" am I right??Voice/Music - I'm the type of person who will go on youtube and search ""Anime OST that will make you cry"" while reading his manga. Yes, I think OST/background songs plays an important role to VNs. This is because the purpose for OST is to make the VNs to be alive, make you want to be part of the story. And Nekopara OST are pretty good. Not gonna lie, I like some of the OST from this game. The voice actor are all great and lovely, if you play Imouto Paradise or any loli VNs, you should be okay with some of the high pitch voice (Some of my friends don't like high pitch loli voice lol)H-Scene - All scenes are fap-licious c: You got to thanks Neko Works for making this game and releasing the patch straight after the game launchs. Animated H-Scene are my kind of game, like Ultimate Boobs War. I know some of you will get the patch without paying, but if possible do continue to SUPPORT the content creator <3Overall -  I have no complains for this game. Just another VNs added to my collection. I enjoy the VNs especially the H-Scene :^)"

Here's the real way to play:STEP 1: Buy the game.STEP 2: Download and install the 18+ patch from somewhere reliable.STEP 3: If you live with your parents, lock your bedroom door.STEP 4: Get a big wad of toilet paper or a box of kleenex. You'll need more than you think.STEP 5: Boot up the game, speed through it but read just enough story to know what's happening when you eventually reach the H-Scenes.STEP 6: Beat the Bishop, Polish your Mustang, Manage the Glue Factory, etc.STEP 7: Sit there like the pathetic waste of matter that you are, droplets of baby batter running down your stomach.STEP 8: Regret everything, put in a refund request for the game.STEP 9: Try to rekindle a relationship with a past love interest IRL and fail miserablySTEP 10: Out of frustration, flirt with multiple girls who remind you of the original one.STEP 11: Ruin your reputation with any and all females you were friends with.STEP 12: Go home and feel bad for yourself.STEP 13: Go on Steam and see Nekopara on the front page.STEP 14: Repeat from Step 1."

Two ""catgirls"" sneak their way into the luggage and surprise their owner in a ""we're too far from home so you can't get rid of us"" way.In the first part, you take advantage of legalized slavery to get Chocola and Vanilla to dress up as cute maids, which brings a lot ofcreeps and virginscustomers to the shop. It's pretty obvious that you wouldn't have any customers without them, yet you find the MC constantly complaining about them.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=758540098Eventually (ep5) they go in heat and you ♥♥♥♥ the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them.

I surely took my time to read this, in fact, I used a bit over 15 hours to finish it where on Volume 1 I spent over 25 hours just for not finishing it on a single session.As this novel is intended to be a eroge, I played it as patched version so I'm not sure how much shorter the ""original Steam version"" after all is. I would assume that the length of this novel is somewhere between 3-10 hours, depending on your reading style.The artwork and usage of colours on this title are highly detailed and beautiful to see, the story continues its predecessor nicely and is emotional like on Volume 1.It is really pleasant to read Nekopara thanks to almost continuously animated characters (E-Mote System) which bring the novel to a whole different level compared to the more usual ""standstill picture"" based visual novels.Translation at least to English seems to be pretty fluent since I didn't notice even a single typo on text.I'm on pretty high spirits that we will see Volume 3 someday, hopefully for next year if the sales are going to go well. Which shouldn't be any major problem with this title, so I'm willing to wait whatever it takes to see the stories of last two catgirls of Minaduki family, Cinnamon & Maple - or whatever we might be seeing in the future? Only time will tell us."

However, you can jolly well believe it is.You're probably coming here for a third time knowing pretty well what the goods are, but if by some accident you clicked on this store page and could not comprehend what is going on there, i am here to the rescue:1) Nekopara 2 is a sequel to award winning psychological thriller about a young man who eloped from his parents to open a bakery that costs at least several hundred grands by the look of it, and suddenly all of his antropomorphic cat pets with various chest size and his sister want his D, and no matter how much he resists, he has no option other than to give it. Apparently, in utopian society that's the pinnacle of existential crisis that you have to worry about.2) Nekopara is an eroge, which means that the gameplay consists of reading a story about fully voiced animated characters while music is playin and they're smiling and jiggling their breasts, to get emotionally attached to them, and then masturbate severely when the H scene hits. Yeah, that's about it.3) As ususal, steam version is half the price cut out with no sex, since volvo believes that community of steam will be traumatised for life after seeing a nipple, but developers offer uncesoring patch at theirwebsitefor ten more bucks, so instead of buying on Steam it would make more sense to either buy full game from Dlsite or go full YARR on the patch, but i just woke up with hangover and what's done is done.4) Sayori needs more noodles to keep drawing, so buy this.5) It's a sequel, there was also fandisc ""Nekopara vol 0"" which has no h, so if youre looking to play full collection, you have to go in release order.6) Game comes with three languages: english and two kinds of eldrich runes of the time before mankind.7) They still offer achiviements for playing with them, encouraging you to think you know chinese.8) Chest bounciness slider goes from ""heaviest matter in the universe"" up to that scene in high school of the dead where girl accellerated her melons to 295 mph to dodge a bullet between them for no good reason.9) High production values with full voice acting, animation and upbeat fruity loops soundtrack.10) You can disable h-scene animations. Yeah, for some reason that's an option.11) Azuki apparently has a weak bladder, some people were probably excited to see this, i was not.12) After waxing your carrot you can go to Steam and write in  review  how your grandma deowned you after seeing you getting hard for a cartoon and sent you into exile on a boat with one round in old percussion revolver, but powder got wet and you couldn't even kill yourself, because that's really creative of you.13) You can diss h patch and play it for chill slice of live story, if you for some reason ashamed of sexual content.14) But for what purpose?Steam patch has this disclaimers, so i figure you'd like to know what you get with this new steam version patching thing:・Any screenshots taken during the 18+ scenes as well as the thumbnails for saves during the 18+ scenes will be blurred out or otherwise replaced with pictures of All Ages scenes.・The game will revert to the All Ages version when you stream.・When beginning a stream, the game will automatically return to the title screen.・While streaming, you cannot load save data from 18+ scenes.So yeah, apparently a lot of people thought it would be a good idea to screenshot a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥s on Steam (not surprised tbh), so you have this. I don't know how it would work if someone decides to invite themselves into watching you while you already in a pickle of a hot man on  mutant-feline action, because i don't even have streaming enabled, but take note.Overall i give this game 100 horny pastry puffers out of 100 and encourage you to play this as soon as possible, but keep in mind that it's a work of fiction, so leave your little sisters and domestic animals alone."

Nobody calls it that. Everyone calls it Neko Paradise, because its full of super cute catgirls in maid outfits. The cakes are pretty good too. Last night though, I happened to walk by the storefront after they closed, and I could see into the kitchen through the window behind the register. The owner was screwing one of his cats. ON ONE OF THE COUNTERS IN THE KITCHEN!!! I couldn't believe my eyes. Those are food preparation surfaces! I was absolutely disgusted by this clear disregard for food safety.

,Recommended,420110,21559904,"Posted: 29 February, 2016",all,Jamfrost Jamiro,"Nekopara is back and Shigure is as weird as ever. Prepare to journey into the second volume of this kinetic novel series and submerge yourself in catgirls. The series maintains its high quality visuals, light animations, chibi art, Japanese-only voice acting, and adds some new effects to the mix. The Steam version will last only about 4+ hours because they put in a huge effort for the h-content side of things. On to other things!StoryThe game continues Kashou’s story and revolves around the development of Azuki and Cononut as characters. Chocola and Vanilla are there in the beginning, but the game shifts its focus to the other two catgirls. I definitely enjoyed Kashou’s comedic role as the straight man with the jokes and misunderstandings. He’s not going through a rough patch like in Vol. 1, so he’s mostly adding to the comedy and relationships. A story isn’t very interesting without any conflicts, so you can expect our characters to face a couple obstacles along the way as they bake their way into happiness.H-contentThe developer made it easier to acquire the erotic content for this game without having to go the two copies route, one on Steam and one on a website. People can go to the website (use Google) that sells an auto-patcher for $9.99 featuring over 2 hours of additional content if you leave it on auto-play (best way to keep the keyboard clean) and listen to all the voice work. The additional scenes are quite substantial and go full hentai with the shortest one being around 30 minutes. They use a mixture of stills, light animation (which can be turned off), and lewd sounds. They also made Kashou have a superhuman amount of “frosting” to give. The scenes seemed a little too long, but that just means that they’ll entertain others for quite a bit of time if the body is willing.There are some things to consider before purchasing the patch. The scenes cause a bit of a tonal change, probably due to the length of them as the sensual frolicking did last for quite a while. The game goes from cute to very, very sticky. The writing also shifts into porn territory with the lewd version of “come” and its conjugations being used frequently. At one point, I saw “baby bakery” with “man-batter” being used in a single sentence. There are also slurping sounds. If you want to maintain a lighter, perverted mood, then the patch might not be the best idea. Stick with the Steam version instead or be prepared to see them in a different light. For example, I have a hard time remembering the plot because the game ended soon after an hour long lovemaking scene. I’m pretty sure it was a happy ending. Oho! Lastly, the h-content has mosaic censorship in place and please make sure to stay moisturized with a clean towel nearby while playing this game.The BugIn my playthrough, for the whole experience, there was a frequently occuring auto-play bug that stopped the game from progressing until I clicked or pressed enter. This interrupted my relaxed state as I did prefer sitting back while reading what was happening. It went something… *click* like this. It never went away. I still see it in my sleep. Be warned! There were also a couple of weird graphical glitches happening with mouths closing and opening a bit too fast while speaking. They contributed to my impression that the game wasn’t as polished since auto-play is how I roll, but maybe other people will not have the same issue.-Nekopara Vol. 2 seems like a fine entry for the series. It double downs on the h-content if you want erotic shenanigans and has a proper story, unlike Vol. 0. As a reminder, this game isn’t a dating sim. There are no choices. It’s a kinetic novel. Have fun!"

Eventually, I journeyed out to my local Buddhist Temple and prayed for forgiveness,forgiveness for the sin of believing that 3D was superior to 2D, followed by praying that one day catgirls will truly exist.Other then what i've said above i strongly reccomend the Nekopara Series (0,1 and 2) and that it is a must try for all Moe Enthusiasts out there. 10/10 (They also improved the sounds :^) compared to the first volume along with some pretty good faces :^) )Also for those who were wondering, No Buddha did not answer my prayers."

I was excited for this amazing game because it lets me spend more quality time with them.What I didn't expect was for Coconut and Azuki to fall in love with me as well. I didn't think it was possible, but soon my heart began to beat the way it did when Chocola and Vanilla changed my life so long ago. However, I could never love Coconut and Azuki as much as my two wives. I am truly in love with them, and blessed to be married to such beautiful catgirls.My only complaint is that Chocola and Vanilla have been downgraded to secondary characters. 9/10EDIT: I awoke in a dark room, sprawled against the cold concrete floor. There was a dull throbbing in the back of my head, and my mouth was filled with the taste of cotton. I could barely move my body. I started to shuffle around in confusion, until I heard footsteps slowly approaching my direction. A familiar, monotone voice addressed me.""It looks like you've been spending a lot of time with our older sisters lately.""Vanilla's figure slowly emerged from the darkness, leading Chocola right behind her. The footsteps continued until they were close enough that I could smell the dried blood on their bodies. Chocola towered over me, staring down at me with a frenzy in her eyes. I could feel her breathing heavily as she spoke.""You didn't abandon us, did you Master?! Master, that's not true, is it? Tell me it's a lie, Master!!! MASTER?!?!?""I tried to speak, but no words would came out. Instead, my throat could only tremble pathetically.Vanilla just stared straight ahead with her arms behind her back, devoid of any emotion.""A promise is a promise, Master. You said it would be just the two of us, and no one else. Forever.""""FOREVER!""Chocola shrieked. She suddenly struck her foot down with incredible force, leaving a crack in the ground beside my skull. She continued to twitch in place, with a huge, toothless grin plastered on her face.Vanilla knelt down next to me, still avoiding my gaze. Her face was inches from my body, yet she looked at me like a distant object, like I wasn't even there. With one hand she caressed my body with her nails, while finally revealing what she had concealed behind her back: One long, sharp knife, absolutely corroded with rust.""It looks like we'll have to teach him the consequences of toying with catpanions' feelings.""She spoke with indifference. No sympathy, not even any cruelty. Just the cold matter-of-factness of something that had to be done.She traced the blade across my neck in a slow, agonizing motion. The jagged metal dug in and scraped my skin as she dragged it across. Vanilla pressed harder, while Chocola's breathing grew more hysteric. Just as I could feel the skin about to break, Chocola shrieked.""B-But Master loved us!""Vanilla stopped. She withdrew the knife, its tip still fresh with my blood, but held it close.""Of course...""She spoke directly into my ear.""Perhaps we could give you another chance, Master. All you have to do is warn the others not to cheat on their catgirls. And, of course, promise to never leave us again.""I still couldn't speak to give my answer, but she finally looked into my eyes and seemed to understand. She nodded faintly, and stood up.""This time, we'll make sure it's a promise you won't break.""She produced a scroll of paper with symbols written on it that matched no language I had ever seen before. Holding the moist tip of the knife like a pen, she scribbled a circle with my own blood.""It is done.""The paper immediately burst into flames, and I felt my entire body shudder violently. Chocola clapped gleefully and jumped for joy, her usual demeanor returning to her. She quickly pulled me to my feet and hugged me, squeezing hard enough to break a few ribs.""This calls for a celebration, Master!""Chocola reached behind herself to pull out a surprise. She raised an enormous axe above her shoulder like a baseball bat. I don't know how she was hiding that thing behind her back, but there it was, gleaming like it was the weapon of some RPG hero. Its size would have been comical if it weren't being swung directly into my head.""Goodnight, Master!~ ❤""My vision went black.~☆~☆~☆~☆~☆~☆~☆~☆~☆~☆~I woke again in front of my laptop, with a new pain in the recess of my head, and the Nekopara Vol. 2 OP playing on the screen.

So Nekopara is a animated VN that if you are on this page you already know about and at this moment in time is one of the top rated games on Steam. But what has changed from the first game and prequel? Well nothing much apart from the petting feature has returned and you can even pet the catgirl that you met in the first game now. The story now focuses on 2 of the different catgirls all though Chocola and Vanilla are still given their fair share of time.So I am a sucker for stories that can be emotional and surprisingly for what is considered a ""single player game so you play with yourself"" game that is what is you get, these emotional scenes typically come about after the 18+ scenes when the protagonist is bonding? With the catgirl who he has just spent the past 25 minutes inside of.Now the 18+ scenes that is what most of you are really here for.Straight off the bat there has been an official 18+ patch that can be bought which is a nice change from the previous games. And the scenes themselves are.. good quality? I honestly don't play a lot of VNs hell I rarely even review games. I started referencing Nekopara in an ironic way but then it just sort of became something that stuck with me.So should you buy Nekopara? Well if you don't mind appearing offline for the time you are planning on playing it and if you are prepared for any ""what the ♥♥♥♥ are you playing"" questions then yeah it is a pleasant little VN with an average but nice story with a few twists and turns which are predictable no doubt but still nice enough to not come across as too cliche, and the 18+ scenes are well put together as opposed to being crammed in without any warning.I can't wait for Volume 3 to be released so I can be a huge let down to my friends and family even more!"

,Recommended,420110,21351260,"Posted: 20 February, 2016",all,Kujar3Player,"It's been a long wait since Nekopara vol.1 first came out but vol.2 finally arrived, 2 months later than originaly planned but it was worth the wait.Nekopara continues with the amazing quality that you simply don't see in your usuall Visual Novel, the production values really show and I consider it being the biggest strenght of the series. The animations possible because of the engine these titles are made in really make for enjoyable experience, double that because of the really nicely done drawings, the artist really is talented. This VN is really pleasant to look at.The story kicks off where Vol.1 left off and I would strongly suggest you play the first title before this one to really get what's going on. You can skip Vol.0 if you chose to do so but that one being the cheapest of them makes for a good candidate to see if you'll like the style of these VNs. Overall I'd say the story is a bit weaker than Vol.1's, there's a part where you meet someone from the previous game and they promise to visit your place, I've been anticipating that moment but either they chose to skip it or forgot about it or are saving it for vol.3 (don't see why, when it really isn't that important) but it made me a bit sad that they didn't show up nonetheless. This is, of course, very subjective opinion tho and even this storyline made me care about the characters and made me feel all kinds of emotions so it definitely isn't bad, but it didn't quite make me cry as the first title did.Voice acting is, once again, on point and while I can't understand anything cause I never learned Japanese, it still adds a lot to the overall immersion, all the characters are voiced, except for the main one (essentialy ""you""), which makes sense I guess. You'll never notice anything unnatural in the voice acting and you can really ""feel"" the character's emotions just by hearing them.Also, what's up with this price? I know it's not a long experience (my playtime is a bit inflated due to leaving the game on background at times, like now, just listening to the soundtrack...), but damn, once again, the quality... it makes for at least 15€ title if not more. So I just went ahead and bought the R18 patch for additional 9.99 to support the devs, I could live without the R18 parts but whatever... It's like when porn tries to do story and it's awkward, I feel the oposite with this VN, might be just me tho. But if you'll like what you see and want to throw some more money at the devs, I encourage you to support them and not just download the R18 patch for free, because that's piracy and these guys deserve better.So is it worth it? I can't tell you, if you're into visual novels then totaly! If you're not... give it a go anyway, nekopara vol.1 was my first VN too and I am really happy that I gave it a go. One thing to note is that Nekopara is strictly linear experience, there are no choises, there's no reason to go through it again once you beat it, which might put some of you off, but I don't think that the lack of choise is really important here really. If you're not into catgirls, you'll be after reading through these titles. JUST BUY IT ALREADYI really want Vol.3 already! I am a bit sad that Vol.2 is over, guess we'll see ourselves again next year! Go strong nekoworks."

This is going to be a serious review of Nekopara Vol.2I guess you have already finnished Vol.1 when you read this. If not, this review might not help you much since i am going to compare both games.In contrast to Vol.1 in this game story focuses on Azuki and Coconut sister's of Vanilla and Chocola. We have some stuff about the relations in Minaduki's family and between them. It's often funny and chilling however the game also has a few serious moments. Personally I preferred Vol.1 story a little more than this one, but still it was really enjoyable too (I guess that there was a lot more of the moe stuff in Vol.1 lol).What has changed?The quality of art is as good as it was in Vol.1. There are also some new animations added in Vol.2, which is really cool.Going to the music, we have the same tracks as in the first part of the Nekopara series so if you played it you have your own opinion about them.The best Nekopara Vol.2 addition is probably the petting system. You can pet you favourite character all day, all night and listen how it purrs and meows... Kawaii.That's all. If you enjoyed the first part of the Nekopara series I sincerely recommend you this one. Relaxing, cute and entertaining game with an great art and music, great to read on rainy evenings."

He sets up on a small shop/apartment called La Soleli, sporting western-style flairs.While getting ready to unpack his boxes of cargo, he discovers two unfamiliar boxes in the open. He is then surprised to find out that Chocola (ショコラ) and Vanilla (バニラ), two of his family's nekos, followed him by stowing away in the boxes.After a lot of drama, Kashou decide to keep Chocola and Vanilla by his side and then later on makes the two of them, his maid employees at the shop and catpanions in the end.But Chocola and Vanilla aren't the only catgirls in the Minaduki family. Chocola and Vanilla got four sisters, Azuki (アズキ) and Coconut (ココナツ) (which is the central characters in Vol.2) and Maple (メイプル) and Cinnamon (シナモン), you don't get to meet these four sister cats much in Vol.1, but you get to know them a lot better, in the Vol.0 fan prequel that was released last summer, but I can tell you, that these four sister catgirls still live home with Kashou's younger sister Shigure (時雨), which is the person, responsible for taking care of and educating and training the catgirls, so they can obtain their bells.Catgirls will need to obtain a bell (also known as Independent Action Permit) to become independent, meaning the catgirls can go to public places without their master/owner, it can be substituted in place of the catgirl's identification papers and also allows the catgirls to enter establishments and events even when pets aren't allowed.To obtain a bell, they will need to learn to control their cat instincts and act like human beings to pass the hard examen.I think that should be the most important parts of the story in Vol.1 and plot in Nekopara in general, that you will need to know, to be able to continue with Vol.2.Actual review:This is by far, one of the best and most loved VN series released on steam, it's so cute and I guarantee you, that you will immediately start smiling as soon as you launch Nekopara.The story is great and especially for an adult VN, they sometimes lack a little on the story part, but that's far from the case in Nekopara, it's a short but well written story.and for a great story, fit a great artstyle and the artstyle in Nekopara is incredible and is made by one of my favorite artists and the founder of Nekoworks: Sayori (さより), a really talented japanese lady, she is also known for ""Muv-Luv Alternative Chronicles"" and ""Boku to Koi Suru Ponkotsu Akuma"", she currently lives in Japan, but is born and raised in China (from what I know off)and like everything else, the audio and soundtracks are astounding as well, it's composed by Nao and Haruka Shimotsuki, there aren't much information about Nao, but Haruka Shimotsuki (霜月はるか) is a Japanese singer and dōjin music composer known for her vocal themes in the Atelier Iris and Ar tonelico series, and those two did a great job on composing the soundtracks for Nekopara, you won't be able to get those soundtracks out of your head again, trust me, when I first read Nekopara, I was humming the soundtracks for atleast a week or two.The two voice actors for Azuki and Coconut, did a great job on their voice acting as well, but that's no real surprise, the japanese always master their voice acting and it's usually always in a really high quality, Mia Naruse (成瀬未亜) also known as Mio Nonose (野々瀬 ミオ) did the voice acting for Azuki and Tezuka Ryouko (手塚 りょうこ) did the voice acting for Coconut.I can totally recommend this novel, it might sound like i'm praising it a little too much in this review, but Nekopara means a lot to me, Nekopara Vol.1 actually introduced me to Visual Novels.Like it's prequel, Nekopara Vol.2 is released as both all-age and 18+, the steam version is of cause the all-age version and the 18+ version can be bought at Mangagamer and Denpasoft.But don't worry, you dont need to buy the game a second time, if it's like it's prequel, you will be able to patch the steam version to unlock the 18+ content, check out the guides under the Nekopara community page and I'm sure you will find a guide or some nice people who can help you patch the game.Some extra bonuses:+Good Price+Steam Trading Cards/Badges/Emoticons/Backgrounds+Achievements+Petting Mode"

Here goes.Picture a 20 year old man laying in his bed, laptop on his lap. This man needed to reinstill his faith in humanity as a whole and so, naturally, he decide's to play the newest installment of the Nekopara series.The game opens and the memories from long ago come flooding back to him. All Neko's being best Neko's, The protaginists creepy little sister, the protaginist being named after a nut.Many bodily fluids were spilled that night (especially custard....mmm custard) as lewd noises assaulted his ears and many feels were had as the man said such things as ""No Coconut, don't beat yourself up like that, I luv you~"" while crying like a lil ♥♥♥♥♥.He completed the game. Defeated and tired, as he checked the time only to see it was 6:30 in the morning. ""Did I beat the game, or did the game beat me?"" he thought to himself.This man was me. 10/10 would get rekt by neko's again.In all seriousness this was a really good VN. It does an excellent job at being a very stimulating read (yeah yeah I know what I said) with great visuals, and great music and voice acting. The animation in combination with the voices, puts this VN far above most silent ones in my opinion. And don't even get me started on the lewd noises ;) Really I was pretty suprised that lord Gaben let this by, it wasent anything explicit really, just some finger felatio and french kissing, but there was nothing of the sort in the first 2 installments, they were completely tame, I would like to take this as a sign that lord Gaben is starting to recognize that there is a serious market for VN now and have given developers a little more leeway with adult content , fingers crossed fellow Vn enthusiests.Little things like quivering eyes and tone of voice make such a huge difference. It really makes you feel like your in this wonderful utopian world where there is a bakery run by cute Neko's and a dude named Kashou. I would highly reccomend this to anyone who is already a fan of the series or just Neko's in general, as well as any VN enthusiest's like myself, but would suggest you play the first  2 titles to get a grasp on what is going on in the story."

If you haven't read the Nekopara series before, this is the third VN to date. Vol 1 starts you off and focuses on the main catgirls: Chocola and Vanilla, Vol 0 is a prequel, giving you some backstory on all the characters and Vol 2 mainly focuses on Azuki and Coconut, two of the other catgirls. Reading them in order is recommended but not exactly required.This is a kinetic novel (no choices or branching paths) that continues the rather cute story of yourself (a pastery shop owner), your catgirls, your sister and her catgirls all running the shop and it's presented along with Sayori's beautiful artwork. This game also uses the E-Mote System, a Live2D-like system of character animation that really brings the characters to life. Petting Mode also returns from Vol 0 allowing you pet anyone that appears in an E-Mote animated scene. Gotta pet them all! The production values are as high as you can expect.Also note that unlike Vol 1, Vol 2 has an official patch for turning the all-ages Steam version into the R18 version. The patch restores all the content that was cut from the all-ages version. It does apply censoring if you take screenshots or stream but while reading and not streaming it is completely intact. The patch is available on Denpasoft if you search around.The game length will depend on your reading speed, how often you take breaks to pet your catgirls and whether or not you bought the patch with it's added content but it should definately last about 6 hours or more. Well worth the $10 or $20 it costs."

Aswell as the whole series.So I guess this is my review of, not only this game, but the series as a whole.The first time i started nekopara vol 0, I was in shock.It´s not that I´m unused to games containing nudity, as a matter of fact I would consider myself a fan of them (yes I am a pervert). The feeling of the game was unlike anything i´ve experienced, The goofy way of portraiting the characters made me question my sanity. And in all honestly I hated it. However by the end of the first volume I had gotten attached to some of the characters.I thought ""hey, this may turn out to be pretty enjoyable"".However this volume contained little to no nudity.As the second volume begun (VOL.1.) I have to say (with great shame) that I was a bit excited.Seeing how it began I had almost no idea how the story would progress. In that regard the story is pretty hard to foretell until you get to a certain point. There is a pretty long time until you actually see any nudity at all and you really get to bond with the two ""starting cats"". Later onyou ♥♥♥♥ your pets. You litterally ♥♥♥♥ the catgirls you have helped raised since they were children.So the story progressen and by time you have recovered from the shock of♥♥♥♥ing your cats. The third volume has begun. VOL.2. This game. This is, in my opinion the best of the games. You get drawn in into cat drama which you resolveby ♥♥♥♥ing your cats!This time around the fokus has been moved from chocola and vanilla to azuki and coconut (my favorite <3, bewds).  However the ever so annoying flatchested starter cats are not out of the picture completely and you do have to♥♥♥♥ them aswell, again.The mainpoint of the game is deffinitly the nudity but you really get to feel a connection with the cats. And when they fall into trouble you can´t help but to feel bad for them.I would rate this game 7/10The BIGGEST con is deffinetly the lack of an uncensored patch, so you get to jerk off to pixel♥♥♥♥♥.I would not recommend this game to anyone with their sanity intact. Everyone else should find this enjoyable, it´s a well written porn.Now please don´t judge me :PI am looking forward to VOL.3. There is still 2 cats left un♥♥♥♥ed!"

And even though i have a preety good life (tfw u have a real gf) i didn't wanted to go back to the real world, you get me?So yeah, if you are one of the perverts that plays only for the tiddies, good for you brah, but if you look deep enough, you can even cry for the♥♥♥♥♥♥you once fapped to.10/10 will be playing again probably."

I played it at a relativ leisure rate and didnt rush through it or anything.As I played Volume 1 unpatched and patched I can say that this Visual Novel Series is something for everybody. You can either play it unpatched and enjoy the soothing, cute atmosphere while reading the lighthearted story. On the other side you can patch your game and enjoy the soothing story with the adult content and erotic relationships.Some might expect a deep story, but a game/world like this one doesnt need that. Not every game has to be super deep and make you thinking. Its totally okay to enjoy something because its cute and soothing.Despite me saying this, I was pleasently surprised by some of the depth they gave the characters here in follow up to Volume 0 and Volume 1. There might be some archetypes you recognize but it still has a few little twist that are interesting to discover as you learn more about your favorite catgirl. =3In the end, catgirls will reign supreme and surpass woman in everything =P. If only you could marry one... .In conclusion I recommend the game. =)"

However, Nekopara Vol. 2 added nearly everything I wanted from the first VN and more. Not only had the visuals and animation throughout the story seemed to be much better, they also ramped up the story telling with a pretty layered and well thought out charchter development for the new main characters. Coconut's struggle to accept herself was actually pretty well written, unlike most of the ham-fisted attempts making a clumsy character, she is given characteristics that also go far beyond being a cheesey cliché. I was also pleasantly suprised that the funny parts were actually funny as both the timing and animation where on point in this story. To be completely honest I was actually expecting another weebo click-n-fap, instead I got a heartwarming story about the value of family and the struggle of self acceptance.

It’s difficult to express just how huge and open this world is: verdant, rolling fields liberally dotted with swaying foliage of every shape and size fill the space between loosely connected, ramshackle townships where people struggle to scrape by. A full day/night cycle and dynamic weather pull it all together, cementing Nekopara vol. 2’s landscape as one of the most authentic-feeling open worlds I’ve ever seen. A handy minimap points you where you want to go, which might seem like a crutch, but honestly, without it, I’d have been hopelessly lost. That a world this size still feels so purposeful, and full of things to do is quite an achievement.10/10"

And Coconut suffers from lack of confidence and admires Kashou also calling him ""Brother"".It's the usual like in the first one you get to read, pet and have intimate releationship with the girls(Patch required!).Overall very well produced and delivered. I quite like it. Though I felt that the story didn't center around Coconut much. Felt like she was a subject to be had but a quick one. Skipping over to more favoured Azuki.

My happiness was tripled when I learned that in this installment you get to *ahem* ""play"" with Coconut and Azuki (Coconut more than Azuki due to Azuki's disposition and temperament).At around 4.4 hours in all, NekoPara Vol 2 about the same length as Vol 1 (which took me about 4.1 hours to complete), but a bit longer than Vol 0 (which took about 3.5 hours the first time through).  The nice thing is that the art stays consistently good throughout the series and the story stays lighthearted and fun in this chaprter, just like in previous offerings(even during the scene with Coconut's misunderstanding the conversation between Kashou and Azuki after their date).This Chapter, just as the previous ones were, is character driven - and you get to see both Azuki and Coconut grow, change, and evolve as characters while this story progresses and they overcome their own shortcomings and weaknesses(For instance; Coconut is big and powerful and thus she tends to break things when she tries to be gentle and use finesse rather than brute strength - and she is VERY self-conscious about it and berates herself mercilessly over it)I can hardly wait for NekoPara Vol 3 to be released and I get to focus on my favourite of the Minaduki Family catgirls: Maple."

It is also very well drawn. The intro and outro videos are also pretty great, with the music being very catchy!-----------------------------------------------Feature that I liked that wasn't in Vol 1 that is in Vol 2 (and 0): While this was in Vol 0, it hasn't been in the main series (Vol 0 being a fandisk) until now. This is the 'petting' feature. It allows you to pet your Nekos (and sister ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ) in a variety of places, including their head which makes them purr.This feature is used for some of the achievements - you need to pet them all.-----------------------------------------------If you liked Vol 1, I would very much recommend this one....What are you doing?

,Recommended,420110,32199127,Posted: 5 June,all,genkipro,"h1]OVERVIEW[/h1]Nekopara Volume 2 is the third title in the Nekopara series of anime visual novels from developer NEKO WORKs, published by Sekai Project.If you're not familiar with Nekopara already, the series is based on the Minaduki family: mother and father (as yet only mentioned, but not featured in the games); Kashou, a young man; Shigure, his younger sister; and Vanilla, Chocola, Cinnamon, Coconut, Maple, and Azuki, Shigure's six catgirls. (Catgirls are genetically modified human female / cat hybrids, who are partly treated as pets and partly as valuable family members. They are human-sized and with mostly human looks, but with ears, tails, and very feline personality traits.)The series begins with Kashou recently moved out of home and opening a new bakery, Patisserie La Soleil. He develops a special relationship with Chocola and Vanilla, who become his catpanions (lovers and life partners), but becomes so overworked and tired that he develops Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. At the end of Volume 1 as all six catgirls began working there and the bakery became known to them as Neko Paradise.Nekopara Volume 2 begins with the bakery doing extremely well and now known as the Catgirl Patisserie. The catgirls (and Shigure-as-nekomimi) are running almost everything, with Kashou working hard baking and creating in the kitchen. Azuki steps up to the plate and begins managing the other catgirls, and it seems that each of them easily finds her niche except for Coconut.When Chocola and Vanilla have to go away for a few days with Shigure, Volume 2 focuses on the large, strong, and slightly clumsy heterochromatic youngest sister, Coconut, and the small, bossy, and argumentative oldest sister, Azuki.GraphicsThe graphics are of the same high quality as the other games in the series, with beautiful paper-doll cut outs and animated models of the catgirls over deliberately blurry digitally painted backgrounds designed to ensure focus is on the characters. As with earlier volumes, animations are much more detailed and frequent than in any other visual novel series that I've seen.SoundThe music continues to fit the typical anime theme-song style, with mostly happy-sounding electronic instruments and some Japanese lyrics in the title song. It's well produced, but isn't anything remarkable; I can't imagine buying the soundtrack.Sound effects are good, but rare. They sound at appropriate places in the story, but don't intrude.The voice acting is very well produced and the catgirls' voices all seem to fit their personalities well.GameplayAs with the rest of the series, Volume 2 plays like a typical anime visual novel, but with no choices whatsoever. The story is completely linear, with the player's only involvement being to advance the text of the story.Volume 2 adds 'petting mode' and associated achievements, which are also included in Volume 0. Petting mode is activated by pressing the little hand icon button in the top right, which removes the normal interface and changes the mouse pointer to a small hand. You can then rub the hand over your chosen catgirl, eliciting a happy response. This mode has no bearing on the story or any influence on the characters, but the animations are good enough that it's a nice brief distraction.The script seems to have been better translated than the previous volumes, with much better grammar. However, some of the catgirls' speech seems to contain far more slang than earlier in the series, and it doesn't quite fit the game. It's only a minor inconsistency, though. There are a couple of funny parts, such as the ""Fining's Earl Grey"" tea, but as far as plot development is concerned, not much actually happens in this volume.The script also seems to be much more lewd than in the previous games, and even the non-adult Steam version, which I played, has enough innuendo and implied sexual activities that it's probably no longer fit for anyone other than mature players anyway.PROS AND CONSPros:+ Lovely catgirls+ Art and animations are excellent+ Steam Achievements and Trading CardsCons:- Relatively expensive- Adult patch doubles the price- No choicesCONCLUSIONNekopara Volume 2 continues the story of Kashou and his catgirls, and heads pretty much in the direction you'd expect. Once again, the lack of a free, or even reasonably priced, adult patch on Steam is a shame, and I feel it hurts this episode more than the last, given the increasing lewdness of the script.Ultimately, though, it's more of the same, as you'd expect from the next volume in the series. If you enjoyed Volume 1, then there's no reason not to pick up this one when it's on sale as well.AutosaveSaveSave for LaterPauseQuitRage QuitFor more game reviews, visitSave or Quit."

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)Update as of 20 hours of gameplay: My soul is being sucked out of me. I may no longer be of this realm any longer. Too much neko, too much lewd.Actual review: Good vn I reccomend it highly. But then again I've got a weakness for nekomimi. Touches on some actual nice concepts like family. Is sfw unless you got the patch which you have to pay for. Pretty good story a bit cliche but still gets its point across.

You have been warned.Kashou's thoughts before Coconut's /scene/Why is Coconut so perfect?Is it her cute and angelic face? Her ample bosom? Her long legs that just seem to go on forever? Her beautiful set of eyes? Her soft, lightbrown hair? The fact she looks stunning wearing that uniform? Her kind and tender heart? Her melodious voice? The way she puts aside her personal feelings for the sake of the people she loves?Whenever she appears, I just cannot stop my fantasies from growing wild. Can you even imagine it? Coconut being led to an empty bedroom and with you on the lead,you lightly pushed her back on the bed, pinning her in place. Gently, you unveiled your desires by leaning over and pressing your lips against hers. And for this, she answered by stretching out her tongue inside to dance with your kisses.As she savoured the deepest recesses of your throat, your hand instinctively reached out and slowly made its way under her the fabric of her or rather the shirt I lent to her. In response to your touch, Coconut closed her eyes and anticipated where your ministrations will lead. With a small smile, your hand slipped through her *** and cupper her mounds, caressing it at your leisure. At first, your fingers only twiddled with her ******* but as it goes on, your primal needs took in and you began to torment the girl by clamping it tightly and watched as how she writhe both in pain and pleasure. The heat of her skin rose as the libido coursed through her veins. Her undiluted moans echo within the room.Seeing how she reacted has filled you with delight but your heart still aches for more. Placing kisses on her cheeks, you slowly made your way down to her neck. Your hand crawled down to the valley that hides between the chartered area. She gasped upon sensing your fingers, as if inviting you to ravish her further and you accepted that invitation with glee.You descended down to your knees. And as if unwrapping a present, you moved her ******* aside and came upon the lovely flower that she gave for you alone. When you caught the captivating scent of her, you were unable to hold back any longer and you plunged right through the depths of her lovely garden. The essence of her love flowed freely upon your tongue, satiating your hunger with a flavour that is maddeningly sweet.What is it, gentlemen? What is it that makes Coconut so perfect?...Vanilla was right.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=628572893http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=628575581"

The game itself is not interactive, so don't expect any sort of dialogue options to influence events or endings; you're basically reading a book, but with jiggling catgirls.In my opinion, the plot is better than Nekopara 1, but that isn't enough to salvage my rating."

Well, calling it new is kinda wrong, as the function was first presented in Vol.0, which btw is a nice little background-story that I would totally recommend.Other than that the story pretty much continues with a hint of at least some time having passed since Vol.1. It's filled with comedy, drama and a lot of the story seems to be about the other catgirls (I'm starting to see where this is going...). There's also this one event where I can guarantee that any deep fan of this game will gain a minor emotional shock :)Now, enough of spoiling the fun here, check for yourself and get the H-patch for steam online, either by buying it or download it illegally, which many of you might just do :p"

(hoping for a Vol 4 as well >3<). I also want to say that I give Nekoworks a big thank you for keeping a somewhat steady pace of Chocola and Vanilla content (especially in the first chapter with that ""scene"" (¬ ͜ʖ¬) ) throughout Vol 2 as I expected Vol 2 to be entirely focused on Coconut and Azuki and ignoring the other Nekos but there were still many scenes with Chocola and Vanilla which I'm really happy to see because they didn't forget about the two best nekowaifus <3. Overall there's a lot of content from Chapters 1-6 but the only thing that I was unsatisfied with Vol 2 was the final chapter, Chapter 7 as I felt that they just completely toss Nekopara out the window because that Chapter was extremely short and it's 1 chapter off of Vol 1 since Vol 1 had 8 chapters instead of 7. I want more content in chapter 7 (I apologize for being greedy) instead of a complete goodbye for now because Vol 1 had 8 chapters and a fitting ending that was really touching to my heart and feels, in my opinion Vol 1 is the best out of the 3 avaliable volumes (0,1,2) atm, probably because i love Chocola and Vanilla the most <3. I just felt ripped apart seeing the difference between Vol 1's ending and Vol 2's ending as Vol 1's ending was really developed, thought out and it gave me the feeling that I was Kashou in that moment wanting to find my two nekos that love and adore me more than anything in the world ;w; (OK I CRIED AT THAT MOMENT IM SORRY CHOCOLA AND VANILLA ARE MY WAIFUS) tho like any other Visual Novel that has a male protagonist with no voice, i'm assuming Kashou is suppose to be the reader which is me xP, while Vol 2 was imo a simple goodbye for now as Vol 3 is coming obviously. 10/10 of course with the patch as always XP, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves Nekos and Visual Novels as Nekopara actually has the characters move in their Visual Novel which is the unique trait about this series since most Visual Novels just shows the characters standing in one place. I'm looking forward to Vol 3, the anime adaptation and Vol 4 possibly? Please? ;w; (I don't want this series to end after Cinnamon and Maple becomes Kashou's catpanions in Vol 3, I love Chocola and Vanilla so much ;w;) Anyway thanks for reading my long review of Nekopara, even though it may sound that I'm not apperciating Nekowork's creation of Nekopara by my criticism earlier of how I felt that they ""toss"" Nekopara out of the window by giving us a short Chapter 7, I'm extremely grateful that they gave us this wonderful visual novel that I will always revisit and never get tired of. (This is the only Visual Novel that I never get tired of actually kappa.) Chocola and Vanilla will always be the first and only true catpanions for Kashou, i mean for me of course >3<."

Think it's about time I updated my reviews a little too.After finishing vol 1, I admit I couldn't wait for this to come out. Was it worth the wait? Definately :)I loved Vol 1. It was the first VN I ever read, and it's still my favourite of all time. Vol 2 didn't dissapoint as its sequel, with the right blend of lovable characters and strong story (which isn't a given in VNs, to be frank - lets face it, most people don't read these for the story). Although I still prefer the first (by a very slim amount), Vol 2 still managed to keep me riveted until the end.Pros :Adorable characters (with unexpected depth, lol)Well-considered and occasionally beautifully heart-wrenching story (in other words, not on par with the usual VN style of just an excuse to get the girls naked every five minutes)Addictive as hell (which, okay, sometimes can be a problem, but meh :D)Cons :If I had to say one con for vol 2, it's that it didn't end quite as well as the first. Character gets with the two catgirls, fine, expected. But after the events with Chocola and Vanilla in vol 1, the plot continued a bit, and ended very well. This time, there wasn't really any plot afterwards, and it kind of just fizzled out. A bit irritating, but meh. At least the plot up to the final couple of chapters was beautifully written :)Also, as a minor point, Shigure's 'quirk' seems to have been taken a few steps too far this time. Think I preferred her in vol 1.As with the first, a good 10/10 :) Here's hoping vol 3 keeps up the trend... though I admit, I'm not fond of either Cinnamon or Maple, which vol 3 is set to focus on. The former's just outright, off-puttingly weird and the latter's probably the most 'flat' character in terms of personality. In short, she's boring. Guess we'll see what comes of it though :)Post Vol 3 Release Edit : Worry was for naught, lol... vol 3 is so damn epic I've had nothing but running since release. Someone just kill me now, lol. And I'll never be able to look at those two the same way again... Maple's gone from the second-to-last favourite of the catgirls to the 3rd favourite :)Oh, and ignore the playtime listed. It's more than it looks, lol. Had to disable it running through Steam because they seem to have made a mess of the adult patch >.> You'd think they'd have learned after doing similar with first one."

,Recommended,420110,32330328,Posted: 10 June,all,Sapremic,"Lucky for you, I'm a cat lover.Technically the 3rd NekoPara game. It does everything the previous games did, just better. Even betterer. The besterest.Improves upon the headpatting system implimented in Vol. 0, which is fantastic. Because dishing out headpats to all living things (that have a model anyway) is great. Just don't 'pat' their chesticals (do it.) also lets you poke their tummies for a mixed bag of reactions ranging from chuckles to confused and mildly angry sounds.In terms of its length (hehe) it's longer than the others. Especially vol. 0 which only takes like an hour to beat. Solid value for the price, especially if you already love the cattos. (Install the 18+ patch to increase its girth even more, since the scenes are both (partially)animated and fully voiced, adds some decent time)Keeping with the pacing of the last game (meaning vol. 1) you trick two of the cats into loving you with your devilish charm and baking skills. This one is Azuki and Coconut. If you hated Azuki before, you probably won't after this. There is some genuinely interesting and sweet character development for both of them, so enjoy shedding a tear before you whip it out. When Azuki finally breaks down from repeated rubbing (of her head, sicko), she goes from the worst cat to purdy gud.And of course, Sayori outdoes herself again with the beautiful, well drawn models and CGs. Though a few have some hilarious anatomy that probably just got over looked, especially poor Azuki's tiny arms and legs.Although Coconut is the star for sure, it's still very well balanced between her and Azuki and features plenty of the other cats, so expect to have a good juicy time with Count Chocola and Vanilla (best cat).Over all, I rate it 'why are you still reading this' out of 'they already confirmed the 4th game and the 3rd one just came out'."

Each of the catgirls have their own unique personalities and quirks that make them stand out, even possessing their own flaws that make them feel like complete characters. The visual novel style unfortunately makes the story feel a bit rushed at times, and unless you've played previous titles, there may be some established elements that are lost to you.
