While there are a couple of cut scenes that make use of primitive, almost cringe worthy, drawing skills, the story and game play are done well enough.  However, the need to perform time-based actions, that leave no time for error or disability, leave me no other option than to not recommend it.If the allowable time is extended or an alternative provided to skip this scene, then I would change my recommendation."

One or two segments can be a tad frustrating, and the ending wrapped up a bit quicker than I expected, but overall it's a great, enjoyable little game.  Well done on the atmosphere and humor...it struck a good balance between apprehension and comedic relief."
,Recommended,420180,31600764,Posted: 7 May,all,Adder,Chronicle of Innsmouth captures the spirit of the 90's Lucasarts adventures beautifully with a decent cthulhu mythos storyline.  Well worth the price of admission and its nice to see Chuck the Plant again.
,Not Recommended,420180,32955789,Posted: 28 June,all,Fillet Fighter,First half of the game starts out fine but towards the end it falls apart by making some items a real bad pixel hunt and having a terrible timed puzzle sequence and a strange chase scene that is controlled by mouse gestures.
76561198018680276,Recommended,420180,31797973,Posted: 16 May,all,ASBuddendeck,"Chronicles of Innsmouth is a good game. It remains pretty loyal to the source material and adds a good humorous twist to the typical Lovecraft theme. The puzzles can be figured out with enough hammering and trial and error, and CoI excels with these, and are usually humorous enough with enough things to explore that it may only get mildly frustrating. CoI does not fail in puzzles, it fails in action sequences, currently I am stuck on a particularly hard one, so difficult I had to look up an faq, and the answers are things I never would have guessed. There are others along with time puzzles that create a large barrier. The game is good, I would hope that the developers will continue to produce material, but also recognize that action sequences are very fincky with a point and click"
,Recommended,420180,31691470,Posted: 11 May,all,Starit,"Classic Point and Click adventure based on the works of Lovecraft. The influences from the Lucasarts classics are more than obvious, in tone, jokes, references, and if you're familiar enough with the games, you'll even be able to recognize some walk cycles and talking animations.All in all, the game can be a bit short, but satisfying nonetheless, most of the puzzles are logic and I didn't need a guide to solve them, and only a couple of parts almost got me stuck. The atmosphere of dread and creepiness is pretty well done, specially in the streets of Innsmouth, which is quite impressive given the limitations of the graphics. The only negative things I can think about, are that the old Monkey Island humor sometimes doesn't fit all that well with the horror tone of the story, and same with the electric guitar themes at some parts of the game. But that's nitpicking, the game is well worth it if you like old adventure games and horror."
76561198068085563,Recommended,420180,32159522,Posted: 3 June,all,Gilmaris,"I wanted to like this game, because a) I love adventure games of this type and b) I love Lovecraftian themes. However, while this is a passable point'n'click on its own, there is no Lovecraftian atmosphere to be found. Granted, I haven't played through the game yet, but so far it is very light hearted, all humorous and not a bit ominous. I hope it picks up, and if it does, I'll edit this review.Edit: Fortunately, the game changes tone when you arrive at Innsmouth. There is still a bit of light-heartedness, but not remotely as much as the first part. Once you arrive at Innsmouth, the game becomes much more true to form. Though it still can't hold a candle toShadow of the Comet, it became sufficiently enjoyable in a Lovecraftian sense for me to change this review from a thumbs down to a thumbs up.Still I have to criticize the historical aspect, however. It is supposed to take place in the '20s, but you wouldn't know it from anything in the game. Hair styles, clothing, speech (and the conspicuous lack of hats outdoors) all denote a distinct present day setting, and does nothing for immersion. There is very little in this game that suggests it takes place nearly 100 years ago.True, the original story (Shadow Over Innsmouth) doesn't really rely on the period setting, which is why the movieDagongot away with a present day setting. This game might have benefited from the same approach, because the '20s backdrop was a wasted opportunity here. Still a decent enough game, though."
,Recommended,420180,31580379,Posted: 6 May,all,BludStanes,"I've hardly played, but, so far so good. Great graphics, really invokes the old LucasArts games of yore. This game does seem to have a sense of humor, I was honestly hoping for something more dark and disturbing... more... Lovecraftian. But who knows, I'm still pretty early in the game. Gonna play some more and update my review, but as of right now if you like point and clicks, this is thumbs up, and if you like HP lore, this is thumbs up.Edit: It gets far darker as the game goes on and draws heavily from Lovecraft mythos. Overall a great adventure game with a nice mysterious element to it."

,Recommended,420180,31682207,Posted: 11 May,all,Kabal McBlade,"At the beginning I bought this game because I'm a Lovecraft fan, so usually I try any kind of game related to this author.But this game is more than a simply tribute to the author, it is a game which remind you the old fashion LucasArts point-and-click game (like Indiana Jhones, Dig, Moneky Island, etc...)!The graphics is amazing as the music and sound too! There are a lot of care in the dialogues and the atmosphere is superb!If you like old style point-and-click adventure, even if you don't know who is Lovecraft, this game is a must!"
,Recommended,420180,31767865,Posted: 15 May,all,seguso,"It feels like playing Indiana Jones 3. Great atmosphere and great gameplay, like the gameplay of that Lucasfilm game. The music is also good and atmospheric. The story is captivating. The flow is right. There are lots of animations that make the game feel immersive. The only downside: in a few locations, the perspective is wrong. But only a couple of them. I am enjoying this game so much. The nun puzzle is a bit difficult, but persevere!"

76561198283832325,Recommended,420180,31659516,Posted: 9 May,all,paintivity.8189,"What would a Lovecraft based game look like if made by LucusArts in the 90's? The answer is this little gem of a game. A retelling of the classic story ""The Shadow over Innsmouth"", this games invites you to solve puzzles all by using that old favorite menu (Talk to, Pull, Open, ect) What was surprising was how funny this game can be, from jokes and little asides. The creators obviously have love and respect for Lovecraft and the old point and click games of the past.https://youtu.be/nVKW-76QUgI"

,Recommended,420180,33295424,Posted: 5 July,all,Chaoticum,"If you're fan of H. P. Lovecraft go for it. I loved humor, storytelling and characters. Innsmouth athmosphere is really great. It's amazing somebody is still making games like this one.What isn't very good is occasional pixel hunting and final part with lots of poorly designed mechanics and some minigames which have nothing to do with classic point & click adventure game.I'd love to play more of this. And disregard my playtime since I spent few hours by creating complete achievement guide on Steam."

,Recommended,420180,34375508,Posted: 20 August,all,lordoftears,"This is an old style adventure. For sure it will be liked by those who loved the 90s point and click adventures. The entire adventure is permeated by that Lovecraftian taste I love so much.The soundtrack is very interesting, and also the main theme (mysterious with a metal taste) is great.Some full-screen pictures could be raw, but this do not affect the gameplay anyway. The developers are working for enhance some aspects of the game. Stay connected."
76561198162653297,Recommended,420180,34241107,Posted: 14 August,all,muffins4life,"A cool AGS point-and-click adventure that manages to evoke a Lovecraftian atmosphere while retaining a sense of humor and visual aesthetic borrowed from Monkey Island. The initial 90% of the game features some clever if easy to follow puzzles, leading up to a rousing, tension-filled escape scene. There's even an awesome metal song in the credits! I'd happily pay money for a sequel."
