It doesm't SEEM finished because the story it very weak and the game itself is incredibly repetitive.The best description of the gameplay is a very bad copy of the combat system in Endless Space, but you can never retreat after a battle starts.I am sorry devs but it feels as if I have wasted 10$ and 2 hours of my life. It is rather like watching a bad movie in the theater."

For instance; in combat it almost always the best to just target the enemy hull. I can't really choose which resources I want to get untill I can build colonies which just make the resource handling feel plain. Overall great potential but kinda lack real options, prioritries and the likes to feel intresting. Combat is a repetetive and boring, and since you sometimes can't retreat; you might lose the game to an unavoidable non retreatable combat. But maybe I'm just bad at the game."

While it has Great Idea for how the game should be it sadly falls far short. Your fleet from what I have played is 6 ships of your choice (when classes unlocked and buildable) from battlecruisers to your typical Super Capitals these types of games have.The Combat gets stale quickly as the same visuals are seen in near all the fights. Any Intense fighting it advertised I did not encounter in its Turn Based Combat. Issue Order to each ship individually as its turn arrives, choose which guns to fire, at which ships, click end, wait for next ships turn. Each animation has the ships turn the guns at each other.... Each and Everytime and then they open fire. After your 10th time broadsiding the enemy (all you do is Broadside) you would think the crew would keep the guns trained instead of aligning them back across your Bow. But, nope, Each shot... Guns turn towards the ship you have been engaged with for over 8 minutes... fire its volley, and recenters itself forward. Maintain Targetting solution does not exist in this game.While you can Colonize planets and take over bases, that is about as far as it goes. When you have Resources Click the upgrade on the Structure you put on the planet for mining, harvesting antimatter, farming, or Entertainment centers. Each of these assists in its obvious areas. You get One Structure Per Planet. Your Resources gather each day, click and forget. No setting up supply chains, gaurding transports that might get under attack, nothing further to manage. They might come under attack havent had it happen yet.Research and Manufacturing are Instant if you collected enough points. These are gathered from Raiding enemy fleets, bases, or probing planets. Once you have enough points, you click what you wanted and you have it. The same goes for building any ship, If you have the points Its Insta built.Fitting the ships is done in a few clicks. Drag whatever weapons onto the matching Colored box and you have it equipped, upgrade it if you can fit it. Each module has mass and power outputs. Get to heavy and respond slower in turns, Have to little power and you cant fire. Modules of course Exist to boosts anything from Damage to power generation. Larger classes can use fleet boosting modules.Your missions are a few multi choice questions, then go and enter combat somewhere. Use Autocombat (which cant kill anything quickly) or manually select your choices as mentioned before. After you complete the final missions you automatically return to base. You can return to base at anypoint you want, Even when low on fuel, your magically refilled and made the multiple refuelling trip back in a single click.This game could become something if it made the combat more exciting, expanded on planet management or even let you run multiple fleets. Some others have mentioned this game was a Mobile game and it would fit in well with those style of dumbed down content that exist on the mobile platform. But when you can get other games like this for cheaper or equal pricing that offer better, its hard to suggest to anyone to purchase this."

I have put about 10 hours into it and cannot get past the first part of the first mission.  The game reqires you to jump to a planet to put some sensors there and immedieatly the game tells me that a fleet is attacking and it then only gives me one option of engaging the enemy fleet.  But as soon as you win, it immediatley tells you that another enemy fleet is attacking and only gives you the one option of engaging the fleet.  after about 300 enemy fleets doing the same thing and not allowing me to do anything else, (serously not a single other button in the game would work other than to continue engaing the enemy fleets) I decided that there is something wrong with the game and exited out and renstalled it. have retried several times but it does the same thing every time.  this game is stuck in a loop of attacking an infinte amount of enemy fleets or until yours are wiped out and the game ends for you dying."

I posted on the forums about it. a DEV responded to my post saying that it did work...after trying again and again its clear that it does not work.  maybe this is just my client but i dont like being dismissed like that so im gonna have to change my review to a negative.  as of now the only way to replace a ship with a better one is to stratiegically lose it in a fight...and its hard to pick and chose which ships to lose in a fight.  save scumming is the only whay i can lose the ships i want to replace.

You need to constantly save your progress in order to make any progress. If  you end up running the same battle over again, you will get different results and different rewards/salvage after.  The opposing sides are unbalanced, almost immediatelly are your colonies captured and defended by battleships while you barely have battle cruisers. Resources are difficult to get, although I have a mining colony set up I have yet to see any ore created. Research is slow and the costs excalate astonimically to next to impossible levels after you  do the first tier or two.  There are random events that cause major impacts on fleet ability during mission, sometimes requiring abandoning what you set out to do.  Fuel cost are so ridiculous in some cases that even with extra fuel tanks one is forced to jump back to base when you have barely arrived in a new system. Ship design is not fully intiutive and very limited in expansion slots available on ship. Despite this the game shows some promise, but only if they fix the constant crashes and tweak the research and build costs a bit. At this time, however, I can not recommend this game to anyone for purchase.*******Update******The game still suffers from huge amounts of game crashes. Play is very frustrating as often you do not have the chance to save any progres before the game crashes. The game also suffers from massive imbalance making any progress very slow due to limited resources/rewards with horrendously high costs for developing and building new tech.  Still can not recommend the game at this time, despite it's potential.****** Update******The game is DEAD! No updates or development. Stopped playing. Devs are not doing any upgrades/support except by lip service. Game gets boring and is frustrating as very little progress can be made vs very unbalanced enemy fleets.  DO NOT BUY!!!!!"

No permadeath, but the ""universe"" is procedually generated, the missions are still the same every play, though.Monty Python references.Runs well on older computers or computers with out a dedicated graphics card... or on cellphones.Linux support.CONSCumbersome battles, pure old school rpg style (think Phantasy Star or the older Final Fantasy games), no RTS or TBS,not a strategy game.Battles are all about maths, what causes more damage and keeps the enemy from hurting back.And someone already did the math for us all.I can't stress how the battles are RPG like. Both fleets face each other, individual ships take turns to fire (depending on ""mass""), you can't manouver your ships, you can't flank or anything. Actually, you can't move any ship by itself, you control all your fleet as a unit in the galaxy map, and just control the guns (or ""defense"", a skip turn button that gives bonuses on defense and energy) on combat.Not a 4x game,you eXplore, you eXploit (a little), you don't really eXpand, and the eXterminate part, mmm... Would you call FTL or Battlestation Harbrigner a 4x game?I really dislike that this game advertises itself as 4x and ""Strategy"", no such thing, this is an RPG.Bottom line, get it if you don't have a GPU, you already played everything in yout library and are bored, or if you really, really like space sci fi.Get it on sale, it's hardly worth 10 dollars.9 Jun EditAfter 9 hours in the game, I can't say I want to keep playing. There's a bunch left to explore, but there's nothing in the story or gameplay that makes me want to keep on playing. There's nothing wrong with the game, there's just much better space rpg games out there. Battlestation Harbringer, FTL, VoidExpanse, Endless Sky, try any of those instead of this one, some are cheaper, Endless Sky is free."

Despite the many annoying popup tips, I couldn't get a battle to work and trying to do so taught me that the battles (even if they did work) would be very uninteresting to me in the long run.This is so obviously an iPad game converted to PC, the virtual buttons are tediously ""touchable"" in the same way console games end up tediously real-button-heavy when ported to PC.Read some reviews from people who actually figured this stinker out and played through the campaign before giving up completely, but if you want the honest reaction of someone who had hopes for this then move on ASAP.FWIW: NOT AT ALL an OSX alternative to No Man's Sky. Get Elite: Dangerous if you want a decent space sim, many people recommend it. I tried to save cash because I wanted a simpler game, but this isn't simpler it's dumber.If anyone knows a good space sim for OSX that will give me some of that new-age flying-through-space experience of NMS please leave a comment!"

Unsure why the poor reviews!Strong strategy elements, though the localization could use some work. Tutorial is somewhat spare and there's no real indication of what various numbers mean.For those that like to experiment this isn't a deal breaker, and none of the odd choices of phrasing make a significant impact on the gameplay or story overall.I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who really enjoys strategy games! Artwork is pretty good. Tech tree and concepts are interesting. The only con is that a lot of tech is poorly described and you have to try it in action to get an idea how it works. This is OK for some, and leaves some replay value!"

Spent 11 hours in a row in it since I bought it.I was a bit sceptical at first since I knew it was a mobile app, but no, it`s fine for PC)7 battlecruisers out of 10so, pros:- ship fitting, not a new thingy, but I like the depth of customising here, no imba-things.- tactical turn-based combat. You really wanna fit your ships the right way for this (hello grinder-of-orion-battles).- lots of temporary and permanent in-battle effects, sometimes have to change strategy because of high gravitation near the planet, where your ships can be slow easy targets, or some solar radiation tampering with ships capacitors.- kind of nice free roam exploring mode.- overall nice picture and ship designs.cons:- every faction in this game attacks you on sight, whereever you go, you have to wipe out everything in your way, no standings, no trading, no anything. Except main story, where you sometimes interact with other factions in text-quest style, but you don`t really have any choices there- no way to leave the game or load a save while in battle. If you cannot defeat an opponent and he cannot kill your ships, have to ctrl+alt+del, Or wait forewer till your ships health slowly melt to zero. I Had this kind of situation.- Not-so brilliant AI- You have to start a battle every 10 secons spent on system map. No way avoiding that, Every planet is patrolled by someone eager to attack you on sight.- I really do not understand what some of the icons mean. Temporary effects mostly, there is no point-and-read thing.- No comprehensive tutorial.There is some flaws, but the game is very addictive.Sure, the game is not perfect, there were even a gamebraking bug the first time I started campign - endless hordes of incoming fleets with no opportunity to even exit to menu, lol. But it was kinda fun))"

The parameters of ships are hard to understand and even don't know why the value has changed. For example, I can see the ""Reaction"" value of a ship. And... what is reaction? A high value of reaction is good or bad? And which part will change the reaction value? All of these answers should be given in the game, but not ask the player try and error.3. ...and I need some equipment or techbnology which can reduce the reaction... or the ""Anti-grav"" is just a trash."

This is Beta, nothing wrong with that unless your sold a product that has no business being on the market. Idea is nice, mechanics are boring and cumbersome. All that could be improved but the game has to work and this doesn't. Continue does not continue from where you left off, autosave does not revert you to last autosave (not even star date is correct). Every save outside of base on explore mode fails and leaves you with a ruined game. Auto mode hangs and forces you to restart which won't work becausse of the above. DO NOT buy this game if you are expecting production ready copy."

You build your fleet the way you want to, having to balance performance with mass and equipment. It feels like managing a fleet of starships.-Learning curve. This game does not hold hands, it gives a basic explanation of the menus and what you can do on them. You have to learn the rest by the seat of your wit.-Humor. I've stumbled across a few jokes and references that got an honest chuckle out of me.Cons:-Complicated. As any souls player might recognize the experience, the first time you start there is a lot of stats and you aren't quite sure what they do or how they interact. This is mitigated by time spent playing and experimentation.-Easy to get ahead of the diffuculty curve. It took doing all the optional missions in act one to turn everything I've done since then trivial. I'm willing to bet that scaling diffuculty up can mitigate this, but only delaying how long it takes to be OP.-The interface. The biggest drawback in my opinion. Likely a holdever from being a mobile game. It takes so much menu navigation to get to, well, anything, and the navigation buttons seem so far off to the edge of the screen.Overall: I like the game, and to me the pros outweigh the cons.
