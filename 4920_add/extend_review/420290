,Recommended,420290,32348116,Posted: 11 June,all,Solo,"At the time of this review (game is in alpha version 2.1, so hold your whining if you see some bugs not even beta you know).Criteria:Graphics: 10/10 - Simply Beautiful. Scenery is pleasing. The concept of sunset/calm sea is relaxing. (May not be 10/10 if you've played games in Ultra 4k settings, but from a mid-range spec like me, this is wonderful).Gameplay: 9/10 - Very Fun, Strategic, Teamwork, a bit repetitive. Objective (most people ignore it, few people actually do it which i put 9/10). Game needs incentive to go to the island, like more points, +15 ticket, or something. Repairs need more optimization (i would repair a spot, but won't register. However, if I'm like behind the cannon, then I can repair.) Spatially speaking, makes no sense.Computer Hardware: 7/10 - Needs Optimization, PC requirement said i5-2400/fx-6300, but frames still inconsistent (alpha, so fine). Needs some Optimization work, maybe have view distance as part of option to help stabilize Frames.Cost: 10/10 - for 20 bucks, it's great! Best non-AAA game so far.Theme: 10/10 - There Arrrggghhhh Too many zombie games, and world war games. Pirate theme is still fun and enjoyable.Griefing?: 8/10 - There is a vote kick system, so trolls/griefers will be kicked easily. Bad part? If an entire party of friends decides to kick one player to make room for another, that's just votekick abuse.Gamemodes : N.A./10 - More Gamemodes incoming.Possible improvements:Have customized weapons loadout.More audio customization.Rain map needs to be modified so that it doesn't kill frames.I'd love to see rank modes/competitive modes.needs crosshair in-game.Movement mechanics need work."

Aye, things were looking quite bleak for the Hoy HMS BootFawkin. Crippled and without sails we had thought it be the end, but nay, there she came, as beautiful as the first woman you see ashore after months at sea. The Galleon HMS Here'sWaldo! came out of the fog, lighting her eight port side deck guns, shooting over the top of her doomed sister. It was at this moment Captain Octosnake knew the time to fight was now, to rally his crew; he did just that. Raising his cup of tea the Captain shouted ""Tallyho!"" to which his crew replied ""Huzzah!"" Together the crew fixed the HMS BootFawkin's hull and saved her from a brigny grave. Captain Octosnake and his six man crew gave the Scervy Dog pirates what for, pounding them with grapeshot and grappling hooks. Sailor Otacon オタク single handedly worked the guns, loading the powder and ramming the shot home before letting loose a hail of hot death upon the ruffians. His boys threw their grenades and fired their blunderbus' before the good sailor Youngfreezybaby vaulted onto the deck of their foe. Armed with not but a single pistol and a broken bottle of rum, he took with him half the skally wags before his shipmates finished off the remaining briggands, ending the  battle for HMS BootFockin's life and that of her crew."

76561197963751377,Recommended,420290,30219272,Posted: 27 February,all,AgentSmith,"How to sum up this game? if you enjoy ye olde pirates, ships, gunpowder and old school weapons then this is the game for you. It's simple, effective and fun.There are a multitude of actions you can do in the game such as:-Take control of the ship by nominating yourself as captain to get votes from other players and then colour your ship-Load and fire the cannons with various ammo such as (Grapeshot, Cannonballs, Grapplinghooks)-Fix the holes from enemy cannons-Pump water from the ship due to said holes-Repair sails when they get damaged and shoot enemy sails when you get the chance with the swivel guns-Put out fires with buckets of water when one erupts on deck-Board enemy ships and watch hilarity ensue as you fight to kill enemies desperately trying to pump water from their ship-Grapple enemy ships to lengthen respawn timers and fight to the death with the enemy, when all enemies are killed the ship is downed and you steal their supplies-Equip varying ye olde guns of varying effectiveness-Drink tea or rum to heal yourself-Throw oldschool grenades and watch enemies blow up into pieces... or yourself if you hold the fuse too long.-Mutiny your captain if you don't like him then throw him overboard (I wish the last part was a feature for the pirates at least hehe)There is always something to do in this game, it might seem repetitive and it is kind of but you are always in the thick of action and there's always something to do which makes it less repetitive.There's nothing like blowing another man away with a cannon ball and watching his body fly away.There is a barebones level system and customization system that allows you to change your clothes and character which will be improved upon as the early access continues.The leveling system is for cosmetic items only so you can look a bit different as you level up, i think this is way better as it does not create any imbalances in the game system by including actual character buffs for the leveling system like so many other games do. (Many people might disagree with this but it's a fact that games that include item unlocks and other things in their leveling systems create an unfair advantage to those that are higher level ""Usually"")The game itself is simple and not ""too"" hard to get into but it's also complicated enough for it to be a fun learning curve.Fun Wanted Features: I am leaving this here in case any devs read my review, it's a list of features i thought might work with this game.- Walk the Plank Ability to make the captain walk the plank or throw him overboard after you mutiny him without a ticket loss just for a funny effect on the actual mutiny function.- Throw them in the Brig Ability to throw toxic players into the brig (And add said brig) by using the voting system for kicking people, if a person is being toxic on voice chat against his team and purposely being destructive and negative we should have the ability to throw him into the brig instead of kicking him you should force him to leave on his own accord.The Brig could basically take away all his rights and he would be stuck in a cage unable to use voice chat or do anything, a far more fitting punishment for somebody who is going to be kicked anyway.The downside of this is obviously he would take up a server slot but perhaps you could simply move him to an observer slot and allow another player to enter (Quick fix)You could also have the toxic players walk the plank as an option as well.- Bigger Ships - Boy would i love to see a Man-O-War in this game- Ship to Land Combat modes - A mode where we have to besiege an island with a fort or otherwise and capture the flag or something using the ships cannons on the fort and the fort has cannons as well. You could do a lot with this basically making a land mass that the ships can sail around and the enemy team has to defend and attack. Perhaps even having a larger map where you have to force your way into the land attacking with the ship at first, docking then pushing in with troops to take over the town/fort ect. (You guys ever watch Black-Sails?)- Small Ships Vs Big Ship Boarding (King of the Hill) - You could have a king of the hill mode where a team has to defend a large man-o-war type of ship from an attacking fleet and the defenders have a slower respawn rate then the attackers.- Sloop Race - You could have a sloop race mode where people race their sloops to the finish lines using any underhanded tactic to get to the end goal.- Rowing Ships - Adding some rowing boats might be fun as well although you would have to figure out what modes they would fit best into.- Explosive Barrels and Fire Ships - Adding a function to use a ship as a fire ship by lighting it on fire and ramming the enemy ship to spread the fire, Adding explosive barrels to the ships that we can throw into the water like mines that either have a fuse or explode upon impact with enemy ships- Breakable masts - Having destructable masts might bring more dynamic to the game as you would need to repair them like the nose when you ram, perhaps requiring a few cannon shots to actually break them (Maybe a 0/2 Repair instead of a 0/3 like the nose)- Rope w/Grappling Hook - A function would be to use the rope while you are in water to grapple and get aboard enemy ships from water (Sneak attack) this would be a very appreciated feature as boarding enemy ships from water now is almost impossible.Perhaps using the Rope to lock the enemy ship wheel while you are boarding them that they need to remove to be able to actually steer the ship other then forward.Maybe you can add a weapon to knock people out and take them captive with the rope as well if you added a brig.- Destructible rudder - allowing the rudder to be blown off so you can no longer steer the ship and you have to actually get on the back side to repair it.- Multiple Matchlock Pistols - Allowing us to go full blackbeard would be super fun although i guess you would have to balance that somehow in the end and it might be difficult. (Maybe a delay timer when picking up the next one).There are a few songs that pretty much sums up this game and that's the songs by the Irish Rovershttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGyPuey-1Jw(Drunken Sailor)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFUTHcjiZGo(Johnny i hardly knew yer)What will we do with a drunken sailor?What will we do with a drunken sailor?What will we do with a drunken sailor?Early in the morning!Way hay and up she rises,Way hay and up she rises,Way hay and up she rises,Early in the morning!Make him fire the starboard cannons,Make him fire the starboard cannons,Make him fire the starboard cannons,Early in the morning!Way hay and up she rises,Way hay and up she rises,Way hay and up she rises,Early in the morning!Put him to pumping water til his sober,Put him to pumping water til his sober,Put him to pumping water til his sober,Early in the morning!Way hay and up she rises,Way hay and up she rises,Way hay and up she rises,Early in the morning!Force him to repair the holes til his knuckles bleed,Force him to repair the holes til his knuckles bleed,Force him to repair the holes til his knuckles bleed,Early in the morning!Way hay and up she rises,Way hay and up she rises,Way hay and up she rises,Early in the morning!Put him in the crows nest with a musket,Put him in the crows nest with a musket,Put him in the crows nest with a musket,Early in the morning!Way hay and up she rises,Way hay and up she rises,Way hay and up she rises,Early in the morning!That's what we do with a drunken sailor,That's what we do with a drunken sailor,That's what we do with a drunken sailor,Early in the morning!Way hay and up she rises,Way hay and up she rises,Way hay and up she rises,Early in the morning!Way hay and up she rises,Way hay and up she rises,Way hay and up she rises,Early in the morning!Buy it, Play it, Love It."

76561198022465489,Recommended,420290,34269403,Posted: 15 August,all,Scruffy,"I strongly recommend Blackwake to anyone who's looking for a very teamwork-focused arena game. Although the game markets itself to casual gamers, there can be a lot of strategic depth in higher-level matches which is what has kept me around for almost 600 hours. Most of my hours have come from playing as a captain -- this role allows for the most involved gameplay, requiring map awareness, smart positioning, aiming and good communication with both your crew and your allied captains. The crew role is more under-developed and player retention has been poor as a result (it can be repetitive to load cannons and fix holes over and over), but this is something the developers are aware of and actively working on.As it is, the game is well worth the price tag and I'm expecting many good updates to come in the future."
,Recommended,420290,30277742,Posted: 2 March,all,Azralynn,"See written early access review belowor watch it here:https://youtu.be/jFEl8uPIjcoTL;DR: SKIP TO CONCLUSION!Blackwake is an online first person naval PvP game that requires good communication and teamwork to succeed. The game is currently in alpha.You play as either a pirate or as a member of the navy. As part of the crew out on the high seas, you’re goal is to chase down your enemies and kill their crews or sink their ships to drain their supplies and run the enemy faction out of respawn tickets before your faction runs out. There is no story, as the game is entirely based on PvP combat.The captain controls the ship, calls out orders, and even allows the use of certain objects like the grapple hook. Other crew members can contribute to the effort in a flexible manner since there are no designated classes aside from the captain.To be effective in naval combat requires everyone to contribute, communicate, and adapt when needed. Some crew members may want to focus on using the cannons or other guns, but if there’s no one keeping the ship repaired, putting out fires, or pumping out water, the ship will probably sink and kill everyone. I like how the reloading of the main cannons works, but I would like to see more physics implemented here so that you need to arc the cannonballs more to hit targets that are further away.Aside from the naval combat, you can also board enemy vessels by either swimming to them, or grapple hooking. The close range combat is fun, but it’s also somewhat chaotic because of friendly fire, and not always being able to tell your friends from foes. Due to the long reload times, melee combat is much more common when boarding.Pros:gameplay is fun, and requires a great deal of communication (via commands and voice chat), and teamwork to succeedall crew members can contribute to the effort in a flexible manner since there are no designated classes aside from the captaincaptains are voted into power, but if the crew is unsatisfied with their performance, they can always vote to mutinyrifles and pistols feel authentic in that they are very deadly, take a long time to reload, and not all that accurate at timesmusic and sound effects are good, and well suited to the pirate and naval theme; ambience is excellent (especially the storms)the water and ships look visually appealing, and the ship and character customizations are off to a good start (but it will be nice when more customization is implemented like maybe changing the colour of the sails with a custom pattern and colours)performance is solid for the most part (maintaining well over 60 frames most of the time, except during a couple close quarters encounters)Cons:character voices are extremely irritating (you can turn off the other crew members, but the captain’s volume doesn't lower at all)melee combat also needs the most improvement - when you hit people, it’s the same slashing attack, and it’s just not satisfying, and feels like you’re hitting the air still (more attack variation, and better melee feedback would help here)(nitpick) some severe lag issues on a couple servers (only a nitpick because most servers that I played on were fine, and didn’t have any noticeable latency problems)(nitpick) the character design and animations are mediocre at best, and could use some substantial improvement to bring it up to the same caliber as the rest of the graphics(nitpick) no support for thumb mouse buttons (other keyboard controls are mostly customizable though); only partial controller support at this timeAs far as long term replay value goes, I think it will depend on how frequently the developers release new content. According to the Steam page, they intend to add free additional content for as long as the game is alive to keep the game fresh and active. So, I’m interested to see what modes or ships they put in next.Conclusion:Blackwake reminds me of a naval version of Guns of Icarus Online, but with less content, less complexity, and less polish, which is expected given that it’s early access. Personally, I wasn’t able to really get into Guns of Icarus, and while I have enjoyed the gameplay in Blackwake, after a few hours, I’m finding it feeling a bit repetitive. I can’t see myself putting more than 20 hours into it with the current content, but I don’t regret the purchase. The game certainly has a lot of potential, and I’m looking forward to seeing what they do with it.If you like my reviews, please feel free to join my Steam group, and follow my curationshere.You can also see this review on my websitehere."

It has a lot of optimizing and tweaks that need to happen.PROS-Amazing pirate / naval gameplay. Immersion is amazingly done.-Skill based - spamming fire is not as effective as coordinated fire.-Game is beautiful, even in this unoptimized state.-Community is largely helpful and friendly.-Easy to pick up, but hard to master.CONS-Unoptimized means the game does have a bit of stuttering and glitches.-Musket and cannon ballistics feel too...bland. Because this game is hitscan, leading targets is unncessary making the feel a bit broken.-The amount of bunny hopping is insane. It might be a good idea to tie jumping to stamina, meaning the player will run out if they continuously jump.-Ship variety is relatively low (sloops and galleons only).-Weapon variety is low.The last two cons will likely be fixed in future updates.If you like games like Verdun, Rising Storm, or other types of gritty, non-arcade historical FPS games, Blackwake is for you."

If you intend to play this game, you'll have to follow a few rules which i believe are mandatory to make sure everything goes fine.1: LISTEN TO AND OBEY YOUR CAPTAIN.2: DO NOT APPLY FOR CAPTAIN IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO BE A CAPTAIN AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE A MICROPHONE. (You have several youtube tutorials available, and they will provide you with the knowledge necessary such as how to aim for an enemy ship and tactics. Also, microphone is absolutely mandatory to give orders.)3: DO NOT SHOOT THE CANNONS UNLESS THE CAPTAIN TOLD YOU TO.4: DO NOT TRY TO USE AN ALREADY MANNED CANNON. (Also, don't try to reload a cannon when someone is already doing it. You're getting in the way and that's annoying.)5: IF ALL CANNONS ARE MANNED, DO SOMETHING ELSE. (There are other ways of getting points: running supplies, fixing the ship/sails, anti-sail swivels.)6: IF YOU USE A CANNON, LEARN TO RELOAD IT QUICKLY.7: IF YOU FIRE A CANNON, IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO RELOAD IT IMMEDIATELY.8: ON THE GALLEON, ONLY TWO (2) MEN TOPSIDE; EVERYONE ELSE ON THE BOTTOM DECK.9: IF YOU CATCH FIRE, DO NOT RUN. (or you'll spread the fire to the whole ship.)10: WHEN THE CAPTAIN SPEAKS, SHUT UP.If you can't / don't want to follow these simple rules, you are not going to enjoy the game to it's full potential, and even worse: YOU'LL RUIN IT FOR EVERYONE ELSE. So please do not buy the game.Now, if you're reading this, it most likely means you are not someone who is the target (=kids who don't / won't take the time to read / learn / listen about how this game is played) of my perhaps apparent frustration with the majority of the newcomers to Blackwake. I'll give you one last advice: AVOID THE GAME FOR A WEEK OR TWO AFTER A SALE. The majority of the players online are noobs who just bought the game, and a majority of these noobs are the kind of kids i told you about and it's very difficult to find a great captain with experience, making it even less likely to have an enjoyable game.Once you've learned to be a part of a crew, you'll enjoy Blackwake very much.

,Recommended,420290,32379529,Posted: 12 June,all,jiminywinkle,"Blackwake is a fairly simple game focused on pirate ship combat, akin to other games like Pirates of the Caribbean Online and Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, only with the focus being shifted to a more in-depth look at how a ship is maintained in a combat situation by the way of fully-player-manned workings, in order to give the most realistic idea of how a ship runs. This means that multitasking, communication, and skill are much more important in this game than in those similar, as a well-oiled crew in this game can result in an astronomical advantage in a fight.GameplayWhen you spawn into a regular ol' server (across a widening array of gamemodes with a maximum playercount of 54), you are given a choice between joining a British fleet, or a group of pirates. You will then choose a ship to join on whichever side you chose, where you will typically be promted with a loadout menu that includes primary and secondary weapons, along with some special items with an array of uses (like health items, grenades, etc.) and a melee weapon. Once you choose that, you are free to move about your ship. It will also ask you if you wish to nominate yourself as captain, your previous experience will be shown in the public vote as a reliability %, and you can add a description if you so choose. Captains mostly just pilot the ship and issue orders using a command wheel or voice chat, regular captain-y stuff I guess.As a regular crew member, you are in charge of keeping the ship in working order by doing one of the following tasks:- Reload cannons using a supply box located near it (Powder>grape shot/cannon ball/grappling hook (if the captain orders it)>ramrod the contents inside>push it into position), and obviously use the cannons- Go to a predetermined spot on the ship to pick up and replace supply boxes if they are low- Repair holes in the hull (if left unrepaired, the ship will sink)/a broken nose (ramming, disables ship movement)/torn sails (slows the ship)- Pump out water at a pump- Smother fires using water buckets- Use side-mounted swivel cannons to destroy enemy sails (no reloading needed)- Fight if boarded or is caught in the act of boarding- Repair cannons destroyed by enemy cannon fire- Steer if the captain is not doing soMost of those tasks that can be awarded with a set number of points, leading to leveling up (and gaining cosmetics) and climbing the leaderboard. 4 special players are called out at the end of a match for extra merits (most deaths by cannons/ best captain (determined by number of crew hits on enemy ships)/ most repairs/ most ship hits).In the game there are currently 4 ships (2 more planned currently)- Hoy/Sloop (smallest ship, 4 guns on each side, 7 men)- Junk Ship (medium sized, new so info come later :3)- Schooner (medium sized, new so info come later :3- Galleon (largest ship, 2 decks, 8 cannons on the bottom deck (2 in the front and back) and 2 on either side of the top deck)The captain can choose the name of the ship and its colors when they are electedI'll be adding some more info in the future, but that's really everything that needs to be said for something thinking about getting the game. In conclusion, it's a very good game for someone looking for a more in-depth look into ship combat, and you do get what you pay for, free updates inculding (and still coming). While the playerbase in considerably smaller than other similar games, you won't have trouble finding at least one server per gamemode that has a good amount of players in it (if it isn't already maxed), so that issue is negligible. It's worth it if you think it'll be; there's a lot of good times to be had, mate."

This is one of the few games that I felt compelled to spend the time to do so.The game is not made by a large dev house. Mu understanding of the story behind it is two guys asked for $10k in crowd funding and ended up with like $170k to build the game.Regardless of the tiny amount of resources, the sheer fun / hilarity factor of the game is amazing. There are games with dev budgets into the tens of millions that cant touch this game with a 10 foot pole for pure fun and laughs.Sure, there are a horde of tiny bugs. It is, after an Alpha release.

76561197991772270,Recommended,420290,30473974,Posted: 12 March,all,Famine,"Overall, this is a really fun and challenging game. It seems to be entirely player-versus-player (PvP) and team based. Your 3 ships versus their 3 ships with cannons, melee, grappling, ramming, swimming, and rum.GameplayThe gameplay is pretty easy to understand. Sink your enemies or kill their crew. The only difficult part is how to manage your ship health, when to shoot, and of course, getting into good positions with your ship. Good captains work together, bad ones do their own thing. Bad positioning and no team work will kill the fun for you.ControlsThe controls are easy to understand. Captaining a ship is also easy to understand and execute on. The same goes for loading cannons, resupplying, and melee combat.GraphicsThe graphics are pretty good, at least on my slow machine. Rendering is smooth, effects look great and all that jive. The animations on swim are non-existent, but there is plenty of time for these guys to make that happen. The GUI behind the graphics seem to be rough, but overall, pretty great and will set the immersion level for you high.AudioThe music, sound efx and so forth are good. Takes a bit of tweaking to get levels right, but they all are decent. You also have in-game coms, which I feel would break the game if they did not exist. The in-game coms are controlled by a few keyboard shortcuts. The quality is great. You can talk to your crew, your faction and all players are multiple channels. Thus, if you have no mic, I would not recommend this game. YOU NEED A MIC!CommunityThe community seems to be pretty good thus far. Only ran into a few bad apples, but the ones for the US side seem decent if you stick to the US East or US West servers. You will run into bad crews and captains, but that's to be expected. Not everyone is good off the bat.DislikesThe GUI and some of the mechanics are still not that great. This is a EA game and I'm sure they will improve. Aiming cannons can be difficult for some at first because there are no crosshairs. There is also no indication of range feedback, but that also makes it more realistic too.Melee combat is what I hate the most in terms of mechanics, but it's fun to do. The feedback on melee is very weak. It's hard to tell if you hit or miss. There is also no clear understanding of how all the rifles, handguns, and melee weapons are different or work until you use them a great deal.Loading of the game is extremely slow for me. I don't have a great computer, but it takes a good amount of minutes to start the game. Once in, matches are fast. Loading in my context is getting to the main menu. Once your past that, it's smooth sailing into servers, respawns and new matches.Lastly, the game is going to be repeative. I doubt I will play forever. I would love more depth in the future. There is a character progression system with levels already, but would want more. Maybe even multiple lines for types of crew memebers such as one for Captains. That way people can know who are good and bad captains based on history and their progression in that line."

You need a good crew that knuckles down and follows orders, and a good captain who can call the shots with confidence, or you simply won't win. The game is worth a try just for the experience of being part of a good ship and absolutely dominating.With the good comes the bad though, you'll have bad captains and bad crew too, and those games can be frustrating and are generally not enjoyable.What I find most interesting, is how the captaincy mechanic plays out. As a captain you bear the weight of responsibility of not just the success of the ship, but whether or not your crew actually enjoys the game. You'll get blamed for everything, even when it's the crews fault, or no one's fault. For this reason though, good captains will get a lot of support from their crew, a crew will passionately follow a good captain from round to round. It's an ugly, yet satisfying job that will teach you humility. You'll quickly learn if you've got what it takes to really... lead. Despite being a fairly average captain myself, I've won games against much better captains simply because my crew likes me more than the enemy crew likes their captain, because my crew are fixing my holes and firing my cannons much more enthusiastically, and more importantly, faster, than theirs. It's not all just steering and aiming.Though it must be said, the game itself isn't very complex, has bugs, and lacks in content, and the experience is much derived from the community rather than the game itself. The game will constantly remind you its an alpha.On an interesting technical side, this game is actually 100% playable on 350 ping, and the lack of servers in Australia isn't a problem."

While it's still in early access, it still has plenty of entertainment to be had at the reigns of your very own pirate ship.PROS-------+Graphics - This game looks great, from the water to the chracters. The graphics are not very intensive, and it looks and feels like an immersive pirate world.+Gameplay - There is an endless amount of ridiculous fun to be had, whether you are the captain or a crew member. From loading cannons to intense melee battles, the possibilities are endless.+Developers - The tiny team of developers has done and continues to do great updates for their game. Just recently, they have added new ship models and fixed some annoying bugs. They can only do so much with their team, but they haven't given up, and this being EA, that means something.+Design - The ship design down to the muskets are authentic and immersive. Lots of care was definitely put into this aspect of the game.+Realism - While this game definitely has its silly moments, such as blowing people hundreds of feet up in the air to the hilarious voice acting, there is an amount of realism here that deserves to be appreciated. Loading cannons takes time as well as reloading your gun. It's serves to enhance the already immersive game design.+Optimization - I have a fairly high end system, but the game runs extremely well for me with no stutter or FPS issues. For an EA game, this is definitely a plus.CONS--------Content - While the ship battles are fun, there are some lackluster moments. They are planning to add new game modes soon, so this part of the review may be removed upon their addition.-Bugs - There are occasional crashes, and the server menu is currently not working very well (This is being fixed).Overall, I recommend this game to anyone who wants to scratch their pirate itch.

,Recommended,420290,34960359,Posted: 14 September,all,T-Murdah,"At its best, Blackwake is one of the funniest games I've ever played.  I personally prefer those moments where you have a crew with a good sense of humor than to just win the round. With such a crew, it doesn't even matter if your ship is sinking and everything is going down the drain, You'll laugh loudly in the process and have the time of your life. These moments have been fairly common to me while playing, but it all comes down to using the mic yourself and at least let out a ""yaaar"" once in a while.You don't have to be social in Blackwake, and it's possible to play the game without the use of a microphone. but the game is made with communication in mind so it's a must if you want to get the full experience. Other players are mostly happy as long as you're able to tell your crew that you need supplies downstairs, follow captains orders and basic stuff like that.To be somewhat effective in this game, you really need a captain that knows what they're doing and a crew that are willing to do the orders they bark out. Playing as a crew member you'll be spending your time scouting for eneny ships, firing and reloading cannons and repairing the ship, sails and killing erupting fire with buckets of water..The tasks are simple but when those cannonballs start flying through your ship and you run around working those holes, you'll be thankful for the simplicity, because it can get pretty intense, at least with a headset. There's also the possibility of locking down enemy ships with grappling hooks to finish it off and the other way around. Ths is where your weapons get usefulPlaying as the captain of a ship is different and in some sense more challenging than crew member. You'll need some ability to manage multiple people and tell them what to do and when to do it. And you MUST have a microphone and the will to use it if/when playing as captain on populated servers. Nobody likes a silent captain. Good captains keep the crew informed about their actions in time for the crew to be prepared and ready..You'll spend most of your time in one position steering the ship in position to fire the broadside cannons on the enemy as well as evading incoming threats by staying out of their range and the angle of their devastating broadside cannons. This is the easy part. The real challenge isn't that or the enemy ships, it's your crew and how you manage it. The difference between firing off a full broadside at the right moment and individual cannons firing off cannonballs at their own convenience is the difference between winning a round or losing it.  Take control and demand respect. Your crew should only fire the cannons when you say so.It's a type of game I jump in and out of for an hour or two rather than a game I play for full evenings and nights, but I fully recommend this game for its simple yet amazing gameplay and hilarious approach."

,Recommended,420290,34612763,Posted: 30 August,all,Purple Pomegranate,I'm writing this review cause my firend and I were recently talking about how great the newest patch was and he told me that there are only 2 people working on this game so they deserve at least a postive review. I'd highly recommend this game to anyone and if you have a few friends who are into a team based game you'll love Blackwake.I've only put 14 and a half hours but my friends and I have made so many fun memories already. All the aspects of the game are so simple and still very immersive. Nothing like the rush when you're captain tells you to get ready to board the enemy ship.Learning curve is simple and easy it took me a like 2 or 3 games to get the hang of it.Definitly worth the $20 and if its on sale its a steal don't think twice you like being a pirate just buy this game and get into a server.

You wanted to take your pistol & cutlass, jump onto an enemy boat, and ruthlessly murder the enemy crew. Maybe not that last part. Regardless, YOUR CHILDHOOD DREAMS ARE NOW REALIZED!Overview:Blackwake is the game many of us have been waiting for, a PvP first person naval combat game set in the glorious age of sail. Not only can you shoot cannons at the enemy ships to sink them, you can fire grappling hooks to pull your ships together, and then engage in a brutal elimination match between both your crews, with the surviving crew sinking the enemy ship (my personal favorite way to sink another ship).While the game at it's core is very simple, focusing purely on combat, it does so most excellently. The mechanics are solid, with the devs taking in feedback and tuning for maximum fun output. Below I'll make a hearty list of Pros & Cons that you can be the final judge of:ProsOnline first person PvP naval combat (The best of its kind)At the time of this review, 5 different ships to sail aboardSeveral weapons to choose from lending to different playstylesExtensive voice communication systemUnlockable cosmetics (no microtransactions, hurray!)Active development, new content being addedConsBugs: I've personally encoutered all of them. Some of them are annoying, some are hilariousNo skill trees, perks, or any of that nonsense. Take that as you will.No dedicated ground combat in the game as of right now.

You have to listen and co-ordinate with one another to be effective unless of course you have better skilled deck hands/captain the the enemy.Cannonfighting is dangerous because you are not likely to exchange well, its usually either a good or bad exchange of cannon fire, and it is extremely satisfying to lay into someone to watch them sink.Boarding! Somewhat buggy but the most absolutely amazing part of the game, you will flip your♥♥♥♥♥♥when you kill 3 people of a 7 man crew, doing most of the work for the rest of your team. Boarding is great entertainment for the fact that its the only time those muskets and swords really do anything (aside from ramming.)Visuals:Its easy to see that the visual effects are not top notch, I gotta say they are in fact somewhat hard to look at but, the models and the textures are pretty good. Theres some intricacies of the ships that were made to make sure they look quite like what ships of the time might, from bow to stern from port to starboard, similarly, you can customize your characters to some degree and while its not massive they do have multiple colors, hairdos and both sexes, so you can always mix it up a bit if you get bored.Now for the cons:Its early access, so of course there are some buggy things in the game, but usually they are patched so that they aren't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly annoying.People can be real♥♥♥♥♥hats (Yes, me. Hello Swellhell!) but sometimes that can also be fun, being a♥♥♥♥♥♥to your own team can be either good or bad, depending on everyones mood. Just remember its a game, don't flip out.Handling of guns feels really clunky and drinking tea/booze is glitchy, which really stops up gameplay when you are trying to keep yourself alive, expanded options should be included later on.Honestly, I've not thoroughly enjoyed myself on a game in quite some time, I often play Booty Bay sertvers and enjoy the time there.

,Recommended,420290,30152793,Posted: 24 February,all,ZonkyTheDonkey,"Been following this game via youtube/twitch lately and was highly intrigued.I pulled the trigger for $17.99 and dove headfirst into the game and found my role was best suited as a captain and immediately began experiencing pure chaos of trying to lead a 13 person crew in a galleon and coordinate with 2 other ships.Many people will say this game is very shallow in content - on the surface in its current state there's not a super deep list of features; HOWEVER, it is the interaction with your crew and the enemy ships that makes this game truly amazing. Every found I feel like I encounter some type of unique situation whether it's trying to conceal my self solo on an enemy ship only to snipe the captain every time he gets to the helm - or going on a kamikaze ramming spree with reckless abandon in my sloop.The two developers of this game are highly responsive to the community - And while there are only 2 of them, from what I understand they have contracted out some work to 3rd parties so it's not literally 2 people working on the game only. The game has sold over 100k copies and has a solid playerbase of around 2,500+ in NA prime time.I had such success as a captain and created a really fun experience that several people encouraged me to record my gameplay and upload it to Youtube. I have since done just that and uploaded 20+ Blackwake videos that include Captain/Crewman Tutorials, Highlight reels and more!https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQKazkUT_qPcsypE8RWBClg- One of my videos was even featured by the developers in the latest patch notes in the community spotlight for being so helpful to new players!I've dedicated a TON of time to this game and look forward to the upcoming ""CAPTURE THE BOOTY"" update which will implement the ability to land on islands from your ship in a Capture the Flag style of gameplay.10/10 would recommend."

Thats even more than I am sleeping.100 hours really takes a toll on you especially considering it just came out.All jokes aside, the really good thing about this game is the community.Gameplay wise it is similar to mount&blade warband, where you have long reload times(Napolean flashbacks) and melee block mechanics, albeit a bit simpler.HOWEVER, it is not as adrenline rushing as m&b where you respawn right back into the fight. If your ship get sunk you might find your crew half the map away from where the fight will be , resulting in 2 minutes of boredom.This is where the community kicks in, and with a healthy server population across all regions(even oceania, who can pretty much play with America) you are bound to find people to bond with, who you hate, who you troll, who you eventually become friends.With a high replayability, and mini competitions runnning between you and your online friends, you are bound to get addicted to this game.Note: I did not have any friends buying this game prior to me purchasing, I now have 17 friends on steam and play with them on the same server regularly.No I did not leave this game on and afk -.-"

But why is this good concept dying? Here's why:1. Gameplay gets repetive over time, and while it's in alpha it's early enough that very little aside the basic Fleet or 1v1 gamemodes. However with Capture the Booty coming along hopefully it can provide some variety to gameplay, but hopefully it doesn't end up like ""Of Kings and Men""'s Epic (Fail) mode that was promised and never came, eventually killing the alpha.2. Clunky melee and shooting that will hopefully get revamped.3. The globalized banlist is a joke, with a ""Flying Dutchman"" being able to ban you from all servers at their discretion. While this would be fine with well-delineated criteria for what constitutes a ban, but instead it amounts to reports with on-the-fly decisions often made from a Discord channel."

The sound of cannons in the distance, watching cannon balls wiz by from near misses and the utter chaos of trying to maintain the ship whilst in battles. The pure excitement of watching the nose of your ship steadily get closer to the enemy ship while you hold your sword waiting for that crunch of wood before boarding ..Blackwake is the first game in a long time that makes players TALK! With out communication, you wont get to far. You must load cannons, repair damages done to the ship, pump water out of your hull, refill supplies, repair shredded sails, put out fires and more. All of this must be done while working with your captain, who will be shouting commands on which side to fire, what ammo type to use, priorty repairs and more.Now being a captain... The joys and the horrors! If your going to be captain, you must have a mic, if you dont... prepare for mutiny! If you dont call out which side you are facing your ship for volley in time... your crew will miss or not fire at all. Ship is sinking fast? You need to tell your crew to leave cannons and focus on repairs and pump water. Everything you decide to do and the communication with your crew will result in victory or failure when captain, so lead carefully!If you are looking for a game that heavily relies on teamwork and communication, then this will be the game for you. I highly recommend this game because of this, if your a lone wolf... not for you.Pro'sTeamwork oriented game playAwesome sound effectsGood weather visuals and graphicsRum & teaConsSome toxic players will be metSword fighting needs small improvements"

A large majority of the game feels polished, considering it's an early access game. The game devs are proactive and are willing to listen to the community and fix bugs quickly. In addition, the community so far has been fantastic, they are competitive, whilst being kind (unlike games such as League of Legends, Dota 2, CSGO and Overwatch). These are very rare qualities to find in such a game and I would recommend all friendly gamers to join.However, there are still a few issues like any early access game, there are occasional bugs (however, they do not cripple the gameplay) and it can be frustrating if the captain doesn't have a mic or is unwilling to communicate. However,  this is easily fixed, as fittingly you can mutiny him (by pressing esc + mutiny captain)Overall, the game devs hit gold. The whole premise is mesmerising and I find it peculiar that the idea hasn't been put into practice after all these years. I am also additionally looking forward to the game's future, as the game devs have promised very captivating ideas.

You got cannon balls flying through the side punching HOLES in the ship, the guy on the cannon next to you isnt there anymore cause he ATE one of those enemy cannonballs and flew out the other side of the ship.

The gameplay is decent, with a lackluster community that screams commands through the microphone.  You kind of have to, but some people take it to a new level of annoying power mad losers over mic.  The playerbase has diminished to nearly nothing, and I'm uncertain it will recover.  Hopefully with updates more people will come back and variety will make the game more interesting for old and new players, but you never know with early access games.If there were more players I might still reccomend the game, but as it stands it seems like it is slowly dying which is a shame."

My main gripes are that melee combat feels slightly choppy and that swimming feels like you're basically not moving in the water once you manage to get stranded in the water, it honestly feels like you aren't actually swimming.other then that, tons of fun, voice chat system can get slightly annoying because there are alot of people just being really immature, the game could improve by adding some more quick action commands then what they already have, to make it viable for players like me who would like to just mute all the people complaining about the kid screaming racial slurs.teamkilling is also alittle bit of a problem, the devs added it in as a neat feature but most people end up abusing it and headshotting a piloting captain ""for funs lul""It's tons of fun, interesting, and the devs are still throwing out updates on a game that launched as a better and less buggy game then the vast majority of the early access games that have been in early access for over a year."

,Recommended,420290,30176621,Posted: 25 February,all,Calibrated.Core,"I do not normally review games, but given the incredible amount of work these two developers have done to create such an immersive game, I thought I would write a review to support them.TLDR; A beautiful game designed around solid ship and crew mechanics. Teamplay and VOIP is a must if you and your crew is planning to win the day! While graphically beautifully, the game does need further optimization, as FPS can significantly vary between different PC specs. At this point in time, definitely worth the $17.00 I paid for this game at the time of writing this review. (25FEB17)Pros:(+) - Teamwork - This game fundamentally operates on the principle of teamwork. If you don’t have communication; down to Davy Jones’ locker, you’ll go.(+) - Amazing Visuals & Animations - Reloading animation is one of the best I’ve seen. On par with WoR’s.(+) - VOIP - Crew chat, Captain Chat (Ship to Ship,) Global Chat.(+) - Ship Naming and Ship Customization - Once given Captainship, Captain can change the name and paint of ship.(+) - Complexity of Ship Engagements - Many ways to destroy enemy ships. You can sink them through ramming, blowing holes in their ship, setting them on fire, or even through grappling and boarding.(+) - Multiple Maps and Weather Effects - Game features multiple maps and amazing weather effects that vary from round to round.(+) - Character Customization & Level Progression - While limited, the character customization and character progression is great. As your character gains levels, he/she is able to unlock additional clothing styles and traits.(+) Price - At $20.00 this game was an immediate buy for me regardless if it’s in Early Access or not. The developers have worked hard over the past three years to deliver a robust and enjoyable game at a relatively small price and have succeeded in doing so.Cons:(-) - Optimization - While the game runs amazingly well for me, quite a few others have been complaining of significant FPS loss during engagements.(-/+) -  No Tutorial - No in-game tutorial. You either learn by playing or learn through your teammates. While this wasn’t much of a con for me, others have complained about not knowing what to do or how to deal with certain situations in combat.(-) - Melee Combat - Melee combat is broken, but the developers are well aware of this situation and are actively working on fixing melee for the next patch so this (-) may change in the near future.(-) - Voice Acting - The voice acting for the British is atrocious. This is my biggest issue with the game at this moment. The developers wanted the voice for the British to sound comical by giving the actor a high pitched whiney voice but ultimately, the voice acting is just downright annoying and needs to be fixed as soon as possible.Overall; I highly recommend this game. It’s an amazingly fun and addictive game to play and is $40.00 shy of a AAA title with less content and less replayability. If you’re on the fence about this game, take a look at the many Youtube videos and/or give it a shot. If you don’t like it, refund it. Simple as that!*Note - FPS issue has been resolved as of 26FEB17.

Your captain has to be a captain, not a random idiot ( you elect them and you can mutiny so it's okay )Roleplaying makes the experience even more hilarious sometimes.

You are a crewman responsible to fire rearm and fix the cannons; all while plugging holes, pumping out water, and drinking rum or tee.If you feel brave enough and have earned some trust by your fellow crewmen you can step up to be the captain of the ship too. But don't forget to communicate your fellow crewman have very limited visibilty below deck - a microphone is essential.Terminology you will need to know:bow = FRONT - front of a shipstarboard = RIGHT - when facing forward, the right side of a shipport = LEFT - when facing forward, the left side of a shipstern = REAR - back part of a shipFIRE!!! = SHOOT!!! -  ignite the cannons on the side mentioned abovebow chaser = cannon pointing forwardstern chaser = cannon pointing aft (backwards)"

Despite the lack of content, I have been able to put in over 20 hours in two days with the pure excitement and engagement that no other game with a lack of content can provide.  This is also not to mention the waves of free updates to come that will provide even more play time.  This team of two developers knew what they and the players wanted, and did not fail to provide.Content (at the time of this review):-  battles with up to 6 ships on each server, with 2 different kinds of ships, galleons and hoys-  realistic cannon reloading and firing-  great team communication mechanics-  teamwork based gameplay-  ship roles to help the crew (unofficial roles ranging from suppliers to sail repairers)-  amazing ship combat mechanics-  melee and ranged player combat-  ship boarding-  few others I may have missedPros:-  Great combat mechanics, both ship and player-  Fails to get boring-  Encourages good teamwork and communication skills-  Very few bugs despite what others are saying-  Plans for large content updatesCons:-  Slight lack of customization, but will probably be added soon-  Few bugs that can get annoying at times-  (personal problem)  If you have a friend that's a great captain, it's difficult to join back on the ship next round because the server floods their ship next time, a party system would be appreciated.This is one of the best games I have bought in a while and worth every dabloon.  If you are even slightly interested in this game, the videos and media don't do it justice, I highly recommend this game."

Having a Mic makes it all the better. Id say the only downfall is that there are not many american servers running and if you want to run a server its around 20 bucks a month.There is literally nothing more satisfying then getting a few solid hits with your cannons or driving the boat perfectly to line up a shot for every guy on your ship.

Its kind of a seafight simulation, where u can chooce between the Captain (give commands to ur crew, controll the ship, u can give ur ship a name and give it a color) or be a ship crew member (u can load and shoot cannons, repair the ship, repair sails, focus on resupplies, healing players, destroying sales from enemies ship).There are many things to do, to get the ship up, if ur crew dont repair the holes or pump out the water it will sink. If enemies destroy ur sails or ur nose, ur ship cant move until its repaired. On the other way if u dont shoot u will get rekt too, because they will board the ship and kill u.So u need much communication, good teamwork and a good tactic to get the win!It is still EA, but this game is way better then other games that are done yet. I have seen only a very few bugs that are not that bad, (one time i was glitching threw the back of the ship and was in the water but happened only 1 time) and performence is good too.

There is no way in hell you could manage a ship on your own.What is this?Blackwake is a Naval Team FPS focused on Navy VS Pirate combat in open waters. There are a plethora of modes, but the dominant one currently is TDM. (Team DeathMatch). There are many different weathers and even the time of the day will change occasionaly. You will be assigned one of many roles by a captain that you vote up at the start of the round. You could be running supplies to people, fixing holes caused by opposing ships, and even shoot cannons! Be sure to listen to the captain though, as he has the final decision on the ship and can kick you off if you don't listen.What stands out in Blackwake?The community and combat really give this game its name. They're always willing to help, and for such a low playerbase currently there is still full servers that are played on frequently. People love to sound like actual pirates and Navy men. The combat? Ohmyyyyygodddd it's so satisfying. Loading a cannon, and firing at an enemy ship, killing 3 people and sending the ship down. Ramming is done great and is filled with action. You could be below deck when you randomly here a big, powerful explosion of wood and water flying everywhere. Holes appear, maybe the nose of your ship breaks, and a storm of oppenents rush the ship. Everything about it really gives it fun.You really like to give the game a good name. Now tell me the cons.It's in EA. Infact, Alpha! It's very early in development, but the developers really work on their game to balance and add stuff. There's updates pretty much weekly. There is the fair share of bugs though, but the majority is clipping. You won't have to deal with it much though. I wish there were more players, and maybe larger servers for more ship to ship combat. A lot of the other modes aren't as populated, while they are a fair share of fun. The learning curve? Not too steep, but you still will have a challenge getting into the game initially.The Pros?I'm going to listen these, for the sake of your reading time.-Graphics (Very splendid, realistic.-Community-Combat-Atmosphere-Effects-Communication-Very Team based (Depends... Could be a con if you like to play solo)-Active Developers (They listen to request)-And a great future ahead.My rating?5/7 - Perfect score.Just kidding9.5/10 (Get it while it's on sale! Quite a steal!)Thank you for reading.See you on the water.~reRun"

And when all of the above falls into place and you successfully pummel a galleon to bits seeing the hull ripped open and splinters and blood and sailors flying in all directions, it feels pretty damned awesome (and equally terrifying on the recieving end.In the few hours I have played at time of writing I have had nothing but positive experiences, the game plays very smoothly (granted I'm way over recommended specs) and everyone was mostly polite, helpful, and cooperative."

,Recommended,420290,30420931,Posted: 9 March,all,MessyWetness,"Where to begin?This game is probably the best early access game on the market. Not to mention, it's really fun.PROS:- Pirates- Cannons- Putting holes in ships with said cannons- Server-based lobbies- Boarding enemy ships, slaying the entire crew, stealing their supplies, and taking their tickets- CCCCHHHHHHAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRGGGGGEEEE!!!!- Physics of cannonballs are realistic. They have trajectory.- Requires teamwork. There's no such thing as being a lone wolf- The games doesn't take itself seriously. When you're a Brit and heal yourself, you whip out a teacup (with tea) and a saucer. When you take a sip, you stick out your pinky. Either that, or you take a long pull from a bottle of rum.- The guns take forever to reload. So when you grapple an enemy ship there's a huge exchange of murder while everyone unloads their single-fire weapons into each other, then everyone goes ham using weapons that range from cutlasses to broken rum bottles.- The sailor banter is ridiculous- There's a bleed mechanic- Grapeshot + spawnroom = mass homicide- Grappling enemy ships is a last-man-standing fight. When the first person dies it starts a 2 minute timer before everyone respawns. So things can go really well for you, or really bad for you- You have to make shots count, so you can't fire willy-nilly. You're using muskets, flintlock pistols, and cannons; you only get one shot before you have to spend some time reloading- When you get shot in the head the screen goes black, all game audio is cut, and some white text appears in the center of the screen informing you that you have, in fact, been domed.- You can get headshots with cannons- Ragdoll physics are great. You'll either turn into a pile of red jelly, or be sent into orbit when hit with a cannonball- Weather effects can certainly make fights a lot more interesting. They range from clear, to fog, to snow, to thunderstorms, and rain. For example, during a thunderstorm you won't be able to clearly see enemy ships until they're almost on top of you, which makes for very interesting panic volleys. During low visibility weather the lanterns on ships will be on so that no one is truly invisible due to weather. There's also night and day- You can mutiny the captain (basically kick him out of the captain position)- Galleons. With lots of guns- Your ship can catch fire, and panic ensues (put it out with buckets of water found on deck)- It's $20 for lots of fun and free updates- Repairing sails with hammers- There's only a few maps, which is essentially open ocean to open ocean with rocks and sandbars- The maps are huge- Lots of different approaches to combat. Wanna grapple ships and sink them? Maybe snipe ships with your cannons at their extreme range? Or maybe ram the hell out of all the enemy ships you see? Or play it loose and dangerous with close-quarters ship battles. Lots of different optionsCONS:- There's no party system, so you and your buddies will have to spam-click the side you want to be on and hope that you can get in together. If you don't get on the same team, then it's fun anyway to fill your friends up with lead.- Graphics aren't super awesome, but it's still pretty anyway- Sometimes you'll get crew memebers without mics. That's a major pain, especially if it's the captain.- You have to commit suicide if you're ship sinks (resulting in a counted death, obviously) if you're still alive when it sinks. But I suppose it's possible to quickly swim onto a nearby friendly ship, or if the enemy ship is low in the water you can jump on and take as many of those scallywags with you to Davy Jones' Locker. Either way, it would be nice to have a spawn mechanic that automatically places you back on your ship if no ships are nearby- Sometimes the lobbies can be laggy, but that's more on the side of the owner of the server. Usually it straightens itself out in a few minutes when everyone is done connecting and whatnot- Sometimes I feel like the maps are a little too big, but the more I play the more I realize it's more for preparation and to reduce spawn sinking. You travel a large distance pretty fast anyway- There's this weird zooming lense effect that happens when you're not looking directly at a target with swivel guns that makes the target look closer than it is when you're not looking directly at it. Minor bug thoughIf you're thinking about getting it, just do it. You'll be happy, the pirates will be happy, and the rumbling of cannons will continue."

,Recommended,420290,30443521,Posted: 11 March,all,ThrashingLikeAManiac,"Great fun for anearly accessgameKeep these things in mind if you are thinking about purchasing:- The dev team consists of only 2 people who made it clear this started out as ahobby project, if you think this is a pro or a con I leave entirely up to you. Personally this heightens my fear of ""yeah we're going to abandon the game because...forever early access..."" (nothing of the sorts has happened until now!!)- Despite my negative fears stated above, at the time being these guys roll out patches and hotfixes out FAST to keep the game playable for all.- This game only has 1 gamemode at the time of writing: team deathmatch (3 versus 3 ships), more to be added.- The game is built on the Unity Engine. Despite the fact that Unity has somewhat of a bad rep with some people this game actually looks inbetween ""good enough"" and ""really good"" from the start.- The animations, for the time being, are a different point though. Some are fully fleshed out (insanely long complex reloading of guns, very impressed) whilst other basic things (swimming? anyone?) aren't there at all.- A mic is highly recommended for smooth teamplay (this is not a game for loners, nor do you need RL friends to play with).For now it's a blast in it's alpha mode.

,Recommended,420290,30172815,Posted: 25 February,all,Supersomething,"For it's price Blackwake is a delightful early access multiplayer title.  If you enjoyed Black Flag but wanted a more hands on experience this may be the game for you.  Currently there are two types of ships a smaller schooner type vessel and a galleon with smaller crew sizes on the schooner and larger ones on the galleon.  The game shines exceptionally if you get a captain and crew that works together, and can become significantly interesting in multiple ship battle modes with captains coordinating with each other.The crew are absolutely vital and have a number of responsibilities they must complete in order to be victorious and these include:  manually loading cannons with a variety of different shots, repairing holes and sails, manning the pumps when sinking, and manning the swivels.  The captain typically drives the ship and relays orders but can jump down and help out the crew if they need to.There are boarding actions which require you to fire grapple shots to hook the enemy ship.  Additionally, you can ram an enemy vessel, but this will immobilize your own ship in the process until it is repaired.Currently there is only one type of game mode which is team death match with a few different options to play it.  Either with just small vessels, or a mixture of large and small vessels.There is the beginnings of a progressions system in terms of different cosmetic looks the higher you go in levels.  Currently there are no better weapons for leveling, but there is a variety of weapons which include muskets, blunderbuss, a hand cannon that shoots bombs, varieties of pistols, and a variety of melee weapons.Perhaps one of the more interesting aspects is that the all the weapons have extensive loading times similar to how they would in real life.  The handheld weapons all have well done reload animations that justify why exactly it is taking so long to reload.  As a result of the loading time you essentially get one shot with your musket and pistol before needing to switch to your sword during intense boarding actions.Despite realistic loading animations there are some comically unrealistic elements.  For instance if your boat is sinking water will begin to flood the ship, but never fear because you can breathe underwater!  That's right, there is no breath meter so you can stay underwater for ever to repair and man the pumps.  Ships can still be sunk even with this ""feature"" so don't worry.As typical with early access games optimization is lacking in some areas, but overall the game runs decently and all of the major game functions do work.  The server browser needs some improvement such as better filters, but it is satisfactory for now.  Joining a server is confusing at first because there is nothing indicating what is happening until it either throws you back to the browser or actually puts you in the game.  Melee combat is a little floaty and will hopefully feel more precise and solid as the game develops.  There are no cross hairs on any of the weapons so you are pretty much eyeballing shots in many cases.  The only weapon which will let you aim to some degree are the musket type weapons with their iron sights.  Finally it would be nice to have some type of hit indicator for melee and ranged weapons to determine and something to see where the bullets are actually going.Overall it is a very enjoyable experience and requires a significant amount of teamwork to pull off victories at sea."

Even in the Alpha, you can see all the love the developers have put into the game, as well as the potential for future growth. At the time of this review, there are only a few game modes, as well as only two different ships, the Hoy and the Galleon. However, the mechanics that are there are incredibly solid, and more than ease my mind about the current lack of content. I am confident the devs will hold true to their planned additions, and will release a wonderful product that many will enjoy. However, be warned that if you do not enjoy the repetive act of loading cannons and muskets, you should steer clear of this game."

However, captains are motivated to communicate clearly with their crew and other ships, those repetitive actions can be honed and timed with tactical effect, and the effects add another element of depth that forces crews and captains to adapt strategies on-the-fly, making those tense moments where the ticket-tally flips at the last moment with a massive cathartic pay-off, so you can chase that catharsis into the next round and the next.Early-acess at time of reviewing, but a game like this is long overdue.

Looking forward to seeing what else they plan on doing as they move through early access, as it could use some features to more easily play with a group of friends or a party going into a server together."

I really loved managing and controlling your ship, firing cannons and boarding your enemy. Pretty original.Of course, it has bugs. But none was even close to ruin my game experience or even my match. I guess that this issue will be fixed over time as its updated.I conclusion i think that this Early Access game is truly one of a kind.

A good captain fills a ship fast with the same players.  A bad captain has empty spots on their ship simply because they cannot lead.  I think there needs to be some fine tuning on captains and how they are selected, because those people will make or break the game.  Or, I can see private servers with white listed captains being created.  I'll accept a newbie captain in the game, but I won't accept one that holds down push to talk and swears at everyone the entire round.  Again, some of the best ships Ive played on for 5+ rounds, others I've virtually shot the captain and signed out."

,Recommended,420290,30268569,Posted: 1 March,all,STORMBLOCK,"BEFORE THE REVIEW STARTS. THIS GAME IS IN ALPHA OF COURSE THERE IS BUGSSO SIT DOWN, RELAX AND READ MY DAMN REVIEW BEFORE SCREAMING ""OMG THERE IS BUGS U ♥♥♥♥ING♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Easily one of my favorite pirate ship games ever! (Even above Assassins Creed 4!) Here are just some of the many reasons as to why this game is so great:PROS:Ship Combat - One of the best I've seen so far! Each cannon has to be individually loaded and fired. You can load the cannon is less than 2 seconds if you are fast about it. The preferred tactic is everyone loads all of the cannons and fires at the same time (Shots called by captain) so the enemy can't repair. Just repeat volley after volley and seeing the kill feed and destruction of their ship is just great and satisfying to see!Teamwork - In my few hours of play time I have had many different captains. But my best time in the game is when I have a captain that is good. I had a captain that would call out when to fire cannons and call out what cannons to fire. He would explain roles to everyone and everyone would follow and stay dedicated to that role. This game is built upon teamwork. If you have a single person firing a cannon the enemy can just easily repair the one hole and keep raining cannon balls onto you. In short words teamwork is a must if you'd like to win!Sounds - The sounds of this game are beautiful! Hearing the clash of the waves against the boat just adds onto the immersive feeling. When you light the cannon you can hear the fuse going down and when it fires and does a boom so loud that I had to turn my game sound down the first game. The gun sounds are good as well because they match how the sounds would've been in the 1800s. Also crunching into another ship? The crunching noise that it makes is just so cool to hear and shows developers have an attention to detail.Graphics - Straight up this game is AMAZING LOOKING! There have been plenty of times where I've just stopped just thought ""Wow"" as I take it all in. Let me remind you this is in ALPHA freaking ALPHA! This is by far one of the best alpha games I have seen graphics wise. The water looks amazing and the attention to detail for the shis are great aswell! They even added high quality graphics to the clothing which makes it look that much better!Price - For 20$ this is a great deal. For an Alpha game developed by two people this exceeded my expectations and you should support them buy buying the game :)I could also mention other things like how the game does a great job of handling roleplaying and fantasy - delving you into a world of chaos and fear. You see your crew mates get blown into bits by a cannon volley, having lightning and thunder flash and crack in the sky as rain downpours on your head.CONS:Melee Combat: The melee combat in the game right now is a bit janky. You swing your sword but it just goes right through the enemy and vise versa so you just dance around like a bunch of idiots until a teamate shoots him. But in the recent patches the combat has been getting improved so no fear!Ranged Weapons: I know the guns are from the 1800s and such and don't have a long range but I personally don't like the range of the guns and they could be increased a tad bit.Overall score 9/10I only took off points for the melee combat but seeing the progress means that it will only be subtracted a tiny amount!"

This game is fun. It's not just another mindless first person shooter where all you do is grind for points and try to gun down anyone who comes in your path. This game is about team work, it's about strategy and tatics, it's about trying to repair as many holes in your ship as possible while it's half way underwater and the captain is screaming in his mic trying to keep the team in order. It can be chaos at times, but it sure does feel good when your entire team cooperates and you win the game.The weather system in this game is really immersive. When it's rainy and waters are rough you can feel it, as if you were on a real ship.All in all this game is amazing and I would highly recommend it for anyone who loves team based games or just someone who wants to try something new."
,Recommended,420290,30336027,Posted: 5 March,all,Gogfot,"First of all, get the game it's awesome.So here is the story of how I had my entire ship cheering for me. I was in a server where we had 1v1 small ships. Each team roughly 6 people? So it begins. First we charge towards eachother, firing shots at their sails. Eventually we fire the cannons as the two ships circle eachother. Then we ran. Our boat was sinking we were losing. We pump the water our repair as they are chasing us. We take a right behind an island and then a left to face them. And this is their downfall. As they come we fire the cannons at them and make them take a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of damage. We then turn around and chase them as they are slowly sinking. Our ait sail guns are on point as they slow down and we hit them. This is where the magic happens.I board the enemy boat as they are sinking while our ship moves away to repair and prepare grappling hooks. This is where i start killing every single one of them while my entire team is cheering. In the end their boat goes down and we win the game.My second favorite moment was when we spawned UNDER an enemy ship and rose up like a submarine and just took em down in less then a minute.So yeah this is an early access game. It is really fun and the combat naval and swordplay/gunplay is on point. My only wish is that it had some kind of testing range to learn how to fire the damn musket better"

In short, I will give it a 8/10.pros:GAME-EXPERIENCESAlmost every one in this game is delicated in their roles like captain and sailors, that is the most important point of this game. I've met a good captain, Jack Sparrow style. He even lined us up and gave us a lecture. Well, that's exactly what we come for, the feeling of being sailors. You have to prepare a microphone if you want to enjoy this game or you can hardly get involved to the whole team.GAME-TYPESAn FPS, yes it is. But not like the others. You die after getting shot. You keep bleeding until death if you are hurt. You fire one shot then unleash your blade because it takes a while to reload. These are far more different than other FPS like Counter-Strike.GOOD SERVERSI use VPN to connect other servers and i've never got disconnected or ""WALK IN THE AIR"" like some games even though my ping is kind of high sometimes.cons:ROLE-PLAYINGI've got to realize that the one of the most importance is the captain. Other people can be even replaced by AI because their jobs are quite simple. The developers should find some ways to keep sailors busy or ""UNIQUE"".GAMEPLAYS3 warships VS 3 warships is far from enough! We need more like 6v6! 10 vs 10!We want more kinds of ships!We want more kinds of sea areas!We want more game modes!We want more methods to invade or destroy other ships!BUGSPeople running in the water, people walking in the sky.MELEE WEAPONSYou feel nothing when you hit your enemy with your sword.

Immense applaud.Secondly, This game is absoloutely stunning. The Graphics are very well rendered, optimization is very nice, (basically any pc  can handle it at either the lowest settings or the ones with a bit better PC's at high.) Regardless, even low settings looks fairly okay.This game is based around Naval warfare, with the U,S Navy vs Pirates. Let me tell you, the Naval warfare is ♥♥♥♥ing intense and awesome. The way you battle ships, really depends on your co-operation skills with your team-mates, your captain giving orders, and your eye-to-eye coordination with your main weapon on the ship, the cannon.If the captain does not know what he is doing, sorry to say but unless you mutiny him and get a good captain, you're most likeley going to lose. The Naval Warfare is heavily dependant on the captain. One wrong turn, and you will be sitting ducks.Melee could be better honestly. It's in early access right now, so obviously the game will have its issues. The Melee and everything is completely fine, it's just that sometimes when an enemy is atleast 10 feet away from you and is not facing you, they somehow magically swing at nothing, and slash your face off. Yes, that has happened to me. The guns and everything seem to be working just fine though, so good job on that.Really nothing else to say, this game is just awesome. After being dissapointed with For honor and looking for new games to play, this game will definitely keep me occupied for a while.Rating : 9/10Reccomended : Yes"

The adrenaline factor is overwhelming and the gameplay is extremely satisfying.You work, in unison,  in a Battelfield 2/3/4 style GUI/metric .  You attack enemy boats and attempt to sink them and they do the same.  Or you can ram them and attempt to board.... Or you can do a quick four cannon burst and try to snipe the captain or other players to decrease ""tickets""..  You have to strategize to be a captain and the community so far is absolutely 100% about teamwork.I've played everything.  Ark, CS:GO, Planetside 1 and 2, Rainbow Six (all of em.) Mario Kart, Goldeneye... Tetris... All of them....This will be my next ""smite"" or ""ark"" or other go-to game to play.11/10Keep in mind it's a TRUE alpha, so there are weird bugs and the fact SO many are purchasing it due to word of mouth, it's causing an overload of the servers which occasionally (twice in two hours for about 10 minutes each time) crash.Still 154% worth it.

Theres 3 kinds of ship ammo, swirvels and you can climb the riggin to get into the crownest or repair the sails.Several means of customization - for the player and ship.CheapIN BETWEEN:Based on teamwork - like LoL, CS:GO whatever, being based on COOP can either be a blessing or a curse.Cons:Melee combat. Even thou you can block, it seems to make little difference as the best means of fighting is just going nuts.No binoculars - only way to tell a friend from foe is pressing Q or catching a glimps of their flag.Difficult to judge friend from foe (has to press Q).Its early acess - DAMN YOU DAYZ!Only two gamemodes: 2v2 or 3v3 AS OF YET! - Theres several upcoming gamemodes, such as capture the treasure."

You are instantly immertsed into the scurvy pirate way, and honestly to my surprise the community has been excellent. As long as a good captain gets voted in, and your crew has a basic concept of what to do you can prevail to victory. Thanks Devs, and thanks to the captains who try and bring the crew together. Nothing more satisifying than a well constructed attack to sink one of your enemies to the bottom of the deep blue sea. My first tip I was given in this game when asked was ""Talk like a Pirate"" 10/10 would follow my captain to the depths of the ocean."

It's pretty much ""Guns of Icarus"" on the sea, but way better, more players at one time, big ships and little ships, and super realistic. If you get hit, you'll probably bleed to death. If you ram ships, you may die if you're close to the side. Want to fire a cannon? Be prepared to get gunpowder, load it in the cannon, get a cannonball, load it in, spend a few seconds to stuff it in there, push the cannon to the front, get out your torch, aim, THEN fire ;) it's a big deal.It's HILARIOUS..... a lot of the game's hype level depends on who your captain is. Some captains be like ""....fire left........ cleanup.........."" but some captains be like ""WEEEEREE GOIN INNNNNN YARRRRRRR"" so it's quite community based. Very social. Very group oriented.

It's fun, not really because of the gameplay as much as the people you play with. If you play with strict WE GOT TO WIN people, find a new server 'cause it's much more fun to play with people that want you to EAT THIS POTATO while holding a bag of gun powder that does sorta look like a potato. I'm not gonna go into detail about why the game is good, because let's be honest, we all just go straight to the negatives in the Steam reviews, but the only real gripe I have is in a full server, why does it takes 10+ people to kick a griefer? Especially on a ship that only holds 7 people, we needed 11 people to Tab and vote kick the guy. If the 6 other people on the boat vote to kick the griefer, he should get kicked. But for real, the $20 spent on the game was worth it. It's a good game to play when you're burnt out from other games and just want to mess around with other immature adults without jobs or girlfriends."

They've made dying as much fun as killing, when you are murdered by headshot for the first time you will have a momentary pause.It's a race to keep your boat floating while also firing cannons.It is bloody fantastic. Devs are paying attention, fixes are coming out multiple times a day currently. (late Feb. few days after Steam release)It's the most fun I've had in a FPS/Multiplayer/Crew game since original Natural Selection. There isn't much room for trolling as captains get rated and voted in the start of the game and can be mutinied rather easily. Gun play works well enough. Melee is a focus point the devs have said but is passable for game mostly about naval warfare, but does need some improvement.Landing a slew of broadsides is rewarding as well as being below deck in your own galleon while enemy fire opens it full of holes. Patching decks, pumping, and putting out fires or climbing to the crows nest to fix a sail are all fun."
,Recommended,420290,30155112,Posted: 24 February,all,Carnivoris,"If you like pirates and the idea of doing battle on the sea, get this game.  It's a lot of fun on either the captain or deckhand side of things, especially if you have a team of people that actually try to work together on voice comms and a captain that can handle basic concepts (point the SIDE of your ship towards an enemy to fire your cannons at them!).  The ship combat is immensely fun and the man to man action is satisfying.  It's got decent ship and character customization options but I wouldn't be surprised to see that get expanded over time.  Bottom line, it's a blast to play.  Probably better with friends, but still lots of fun solo."

The british and the pirates. There is no such thing as advantage or disadvantage as every weapon and ship is the same. You will have 1 captain that navigates the boat and the rest are crew members. The crew members may get roles and has to do various of tasks. Repairing, loading the cannons, pumping the water an many other things. The captain is sending out orders and commands to the crew members what they should do and when they should do it. A good captain is the key to success aswell as good crew members. Crew members can't do their job properly if the captain is not communicating or for having bad navigating and the captain can't make their plays if the crew members are useless by not doing their work properly or walking around on the ship without a head.Has servers with a HUGE ammount of players (LIKE 30 vs 30).Has prestige which will unlock more costumes.Very good music.Outstanding Graphics.Teamwork based game.Has some stiff animations.Great lightning effects.Great Weather EffectsThere is a kick system and multiple votes are required to kick someone off.Has Realism (Beside being on fire while underwater).Different game modes.Game has potential already.Recommends to play on servers with friendly fire off as it has alot of trolls and immature kids.Other things.For an Early access game this is such a good. The graphics, The realism, the teamwork. The game has potential in this current state and they do keep updating the game and adding more stuff. This is my personal preference but the graphics alone makes the game worth your money. I usually do not get early access games but this game has sold me.Leaving/kicking a server in mid game will not give you any penalties. There are alot of trolls around in the game that gets a hard stick by teamkilling and ruining the game for others. I recommend to play on servers that friendly fire has been turned off.I do recommend to play this game with your friends to improve and have a better gameplay. Playing with friends or complete strangers in this game has a huge difference as there is alot of trolls or other game ruiners in the game. You are able to communicate better if you are playing with friends too.-------------------I Give this game a 9/10"

Reloading and firing the classic cannons, die and respawing again, become a crew and hanging together with fellow crews or become a captain and lead a ship full of crew, and drink rums and teas for victory.---- THIS GAME IS STILL IN EARLY ACCESS AND I JUST REVIEWING WHAT I'VE EXPERIENCED UNTIL NOW ----There is a lot of things i love about this game :- INCREDIBLY FUN- Challenging Multiplayer- Up to matches of 54 players- Can be the captain of a ship- Get that very satisfying feeling when you shoot your cannon or gun and you get a kill, or if you ram the boat into another ship and get a lot of kills- Honest and responsive developers that always ready to hear your feedback about the game- Some people are best with pirate or either British accents- In-Game soundtrack is amazingThere are still so many things i love about the Blackwake. However, there also many things to be improved :- There are occasional crashes, and the server menu is currently not working very well (This is being fixed).- Please make optimization for PC or laptop with old graphic card, there are many people out there with tight PC budget that want to play this game.- More content to addBlackwake has a lot of potentials to be dug in, and currently the developer keep adding new features to this game.RatingsGraphic     : 8/10Sound       : 9/10Gameplay : 8/10Overall      : 8.5/10"

The pros are that its a fully cooperative gameplay experience , it exceeds at that like no other games ive tried did. which can be anoying at times let's say you get a captain who is low level. Levels don't mean much in this game but it shows is how much battles/experience you went through.The COMMUNITY of this game is amazing , all em are people like me who also dreamt of living long enough to see this game come out Which will bring another big + of this game : ROLEPLAY. Its amazing the amount of Roleplay there is in this game, which is exactly what ive been looking for in other multiplayer games! It makes this game absolutly amazing and IMMERSIVE. I can already picture myself playing 300+ hours and that is , in its CURRENT STATE. The game devellopers are hard working and are listening ALOT to the players. The gameplay is highly easy to learn which makes this game easy to play but hard to master since its more about working with your crew than to try to be a hero. I believe there is some cons to this game like when I can board another ship and stay in their spawn zone and kill them the second they spawn , of course there is multiple spawn point on their ship but I still find it broken a little bit. When I should be in their spawn point nobody should spawn there , but we've all seen that in other first person shooters before. I recommend this game to anybody that has the same dream or passion of mine , the one to finally pick the wheel of your own ship and have your own crew listening to your orders. This game is absolutly a must buy in my opinion. 10/10 made my dream come true."

76561198055167547,Recommended,420290,30362408,Posted: 6 March,all,Crixas,"This game is absolutely fun! Working as a crew is an absolute must. The Galleon is alot of fun as 13 players work together on a ship with 2 decks. Shooting cannons goes like this: Theres ammo crates next to each cannon. You put powder in the cannon first, then the ammo (Ball, Grape, Grapple) use the ramrod, push, then aim the cannon and fire. You are doing all this while under fire of other enemy ships. When your ship gets hit, its really intense. Crew mates getting killed, wood splinters going everywhere, large explosions. If there are a bunch of holes in your ship from enemy cannons the crew has to repair these holes as fast as they can for the hull starts to flood with water. If you dont fix and empty the water in time then you sink.On the top deck you have to worry about sail repairs or fire. There are water buckets at the ready to put the fires out. Watching your crew mates catch on fire running around screaming is quite humorous and adds to the intensity of the battle. If the ships sails are damaged then you have to climb up the masts and repair them. Ramming your ship into the enemy is also a thing which damages the nose of the ship. If the nose is damaged you'll sit there unable to move while under fire. So the pressure of fixing the ship as fast as you can while being circle by enemy sloops is super intense.And of course to my favorite part! Boarding enemy ships. You have a variety of weapons to choose from. Different rifles, side arms, swords, grenades. I personally enjoy grenades as you throw them over to the enemy ships or into their bottom decks. To board you can either ram a ship and have crew mates jump over, or you can have a proper boarding action using grapple. When you hook the enemy ship, the ships start being pulled together. Now the enemy can cut the grapple or get away. But most choose to stay and fight. You need to kill everyone on the other ship in a time to win the fight and the boat to sink. If you dont kill everyone in time then they all respawn and the melee continues. There is something satisfying about the chaos of boarding. Musket or flintlock smoke, swords, grenades going off. The boarding action is pretty intense.Over all this game is in alpha stage but the gameplay is so fun that I hardly notice bugs or graphic glitches etc. Try it out and give them your support!"

First of which is a Team deathmatch style mode which pits pirates against the british navy. The second is Capture the booty which is a take on capture the flag in ships. This game is highly addictive and amusing!When you start the game, you can put yourself up for captain, a vote is taken to determine who gets the captaincy and then your plonked on deck and the match starts. As a crew Member you would do well to follow the captain's orders to form a cohesive unit when fighting the enemy ships... although sometimes the captain doesn't have a mic so he uses in game voice commands he can select which slows his order reaction time down some. in some cases, the crew mutiny and a new captain is selected. From firing and reloading the ships cannons to repairing the sails and ship hull, you won't be stuck with nothing to do for long once the ships enter firing range of each other. If your close enough, your ship can either load up a grapple into the cannon or can be grappled by the enemy...or even if the captain so chooses, ramming speed!  At this point you can jump aboard eachothers ships for the true pirate experience.All in all, I give this game 8/10. It reminds me of doing team death match on call of duty games which is great fun but it's just a mode. No story in this game but hey, who needs it when you just want to play something casual eh? :)  So pick up your guns, swords and...wallets I guess and treat yourself to this game because it's tons of fun!

It's creator(s) are very active and quite frankly, don't seem like they want every cent in your wallet. Micro trans free and a great pirate sim? what more could you want. While I say that this game is amazing, I should warn you that it is in Alpha, which means it is by no means complete. If you don't want to buy a game that is unfinished at the moment, then steer clear of this.

I bought it skeptically with no one to play else to play with, but it ended up not mattering. Freindly fire is usually on but everyone playing seems to be very coopertative and supportive of the mission and it ends up being a lot of fun!Couple bugs here and there, some things could be inproved upon such as the swimming aspect (I always find myself sinking quickly to the bottom like I hopped in shallowe water even though the water is ~40 ft deep), but with the suicide system in place that immidiately places you back on the ship its not too much of a annoyance."

I love that it comes down to a team/crew that can work together to sink the other team however there are a few things that still need improving such as server lag and game freezing which then causes myself having to exit the server lose my score and re join but in all I enjoy the style of game this has become.The open sea combat an map designs are great, very effective and dramtic for this style of game. Matches tend to be nice and quick i havent seem to have found a match being dragged out.I would like to see griefing touched on for example a player just firing cannos for the fun of it and it does have difficult interface for kicking a player. The scoreboards and scores should be adjusted per player based on the ship they are on rather than server based as being on the larger ship can yield faster shots and a higher score with the right crew. Also this game now feels like the community has left it which makes finding a lobby even harder.In all i would rate this game a soild 6/10 and I cant wait to see the different game modes to come."

Now, just before you get started just know that getting the canon fodder award is normal and every goes through this stage, its like welcoming you to the game. There is quite abit of stuff to do in the game and im sure the devs will add more.

Here's what happened on my first match on Blackwake:I join a late game but thats ok then I immediately load the cannons and start fighting. I immediately get a hit on a enemy plus a kill so I'm already smiling and getting hyped up. The next thing I hear is the captain giving orders, and so I listen and follow what he says. And that's pretty much what I did for the first 5 minutes till the game ended. I didn't do to bad got 3 kills died 4 times.2nd match I get nominated as captain and name the ship ""Gay Pride"" and paint it all pink cause I'm a immature 16yr old. My crew was already roll-playing so I join them and say I'm new at this sh!t tell me how to be a good captain. They say wing it and have fun. I did so and sunk 2 ships by the end of the game and my crew was proud of me. All I gotta say about being captain is that you must have a mic and communicate with your crew. My crew were the funniest people I've heard on a video game in a long time and that makes this game 10x more fun than I already is.Here are the pros and consPros:Funny crew or people in generalGreat graphicsEasy to learn gameEasy controlsHelpful communityEXTREMELY kind peopleGreat combatCons:Some people with no micsEmpty serversConclusion:This game already deserves a 10/10 and I give major congrats on the only 2 people working on this game they are gods and deserve more attention along with this game. That's the only major con is the player base isn't very big but you can find a few servers with a good amount of players. So ya that's pretty much it buy this game with your friends and you'll have a blast.Tips for new players:HAVE A F#CKING MIC PLZDon't be captain till you know wtf you are doing"

,Recommended,420290,30662082,Posted: 21 March,all,Necksus,"TLDR; Slightly arcadey for my taste, but there's nothing quite like it on the market.  I give this game two swollen missing heads out of two.Okay.  A bit less tongue in cheek.  Anyone who's played Guns of Icarus (or, frankly, watched guns of icarus) knows the formula for this game for the most part.  The lack of verticality and classical naval style is what makes this particularly appealing to someone like me.  I've always enjoyed great naval engagements and although I've stayed away from World of Warships, I've had a lot of fun over the years in the naval battles of the Total War games.As a captain, if I call out a ship, the gunners help me line up the sights so we get everyone a good chance of a hit.  The crew can get frustrated at times if I make a decision to try to help us survive as opposed to dealing damage because most of these can have the effect of allowing few guns an angle on the vessel (usually because I'm showing them the skinny side of the vessel).  It shouldn't have to be stated communication is key; when I tell the crew to get ready for a starboard broadside, they should all get ready to fire.  The primitive nature of the weaponry and extensive reloading procedures adds to the tension of the engagements, but the slightly arcadey nature of the sailing hurts the immersion.  I shouldn't be able to turn the entire vessel that quickly at that many knots.As a crewperson the intensity is ramped up.  You seem to be given unlimited bullets in your carried weapons on the philosophy that if you fire and successfully survive the reload process, you deserve to fire and try to reload again.  The physics are more amusing than realistic and the combat plays more like an arcade game over all, but many of the problems appear to just be band-aid solutions while the rest of the groundwork foundation is being laid.  I'm a fan of this game, and have enjoyed playing all the roles.  Highly aggressive captains make for wild boarding party excursions, many of which go very wrong some of the time to hilarious results.It's a partially built game but if the foundation is THIS fun, the finished product looks to be fantastic.  But, as always, buyer beware, as games with as much potential as Blackwake (if not more) have seen their potential stifled by singular decisions from amateur developers or greedy business models met with mob-mentality fans.  The future is bright, but far from certain."

Now my specs aren't the best, but they meet the recommended requirements, which is why im a bit disappointed with it.I would still recommend the game if you have a decent PC."

,Recommended,420290,30174717,Posted: 25 February,all,Monto,"Blackwake has an amazing feel and great community. Most people will communicate and games can become one hell of a battle, with both sides talking to eachother.The melee and ranged combat are a little clunky but nothing that can't be tweaked. Naval combat is on point, with cannons having 3 different shots (cannon ball, grapeshot, grapple hook)Boarding an enemy ship is so much fun, right now people aren't use to it so you end up walking through the enemy team shooting and slicing up everyone.It's risky to get a good Grapple because once a grapple is hooked, both ships get 2 minute spawn timers in order to take over the other ship. So if you grapple and get counter boarded, you can't unhook the grapple unless you jump on their boat. So watch out for this.Overall the game is amazing for early access and I'm hoping it only gets better with more customizations and boats to choose from.Maybe some new maps and gamemodes where you can go onto land too. Some ""Capture the Booty"" gamemodes and steal gold ;)Some funny moments and my time in Blackwake Episode 1 :Dhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTA8vtuOhU8"

,Recommended,420290,30350512,Posted: 5 March,all,ArchAngel2190,"I was among the priviledged few Sailors to work aboard the S.S. Auschwitz, and captained her smaller, sister ship, the S.S. Treblinka. A fine, 13-crew ship, the Auschwitz works just beautifully when the crew listens and the captain knows what he's talking about. If captain and crew work together, the machines have never been so well oiled, and while the ship may become holy (hole-y?), we can repair it.Of course, if the captain is a bag, and the crew is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, then it's not as well working and the ship will probably sink.Pros:-Democratic system for choosing captain-Captain names and colors ship-Ship names can be inappropriate, and as a result, sailor morale isn't crushed by the iron fist of moderation.-Extreme emphasis on VoIP talk, with dedicated keys for Squad (whole boat), Faction (whole team, all pirates or all Navy), proximity (for battle charging the enemy ships and plundering the boot- I mean crew), and all (rarely used and doesn't really have any purpose in my eyes, though still handy to have). It seems like overkill, but it's definitely worth it, and you use 3 of the 4 VoIP keys a fair bit.-Novel game that promotes fun playing, teamwork, less trashtalk of the other team (at least, not to their faces, though there is usually little time to do it; though, on the S.S. Auschwitz and its counterpart, we found time). It also encourages ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pirate accents, which is beautiful.Cons:-Some 11 year olds-If captain and crew don't work well together for whatever reason, you get ♥♥♥♥ing decimated-English voices (from British Navy) sound like they're all gay and just feel unnatural-Need a mic to play: basically no way to play without a mic, or very difficult. You simply *cannot* type fast enough to communicate effectively.-Small ships seem underpowered, and are easy to sink with holes that are hard to repair. No cover available on small ships. Teamwork is absolutely required on the hoys.-Can be hard to repair sails, especially on small ships, as if you fall in the water, you're done for, as cap'n won't come about to pick up your sorry rear.Overall: 5/7, will continue to support and plunder.

You must work together to succeed, or else you sink.Looks pretty good and feels like you are actually sailing the high seas. The weather adds a whole new layer of gameplay.A LOT of potential to become an even greater game. So much more can be added, but even right now is great.CONS:The game being just released has it's fair share of bugs.Sometimes with a lot of players on the servers, it takes a while to join servers and crashing occurs. (Took my friend 30 minutes to finally get into a server.)Server stability is pretty poor right now. Connection issues and lag/crashes sometimes plagues the servers.I have to give the game a thumbs up because it is just such a great game even in it's unstable current state. There's just something about trying to repair your ship that's dead in the water, all the while the enemy is blowing up your friends, that makes it that much better. This game really is fun, and can only get better."

For less than 20$ you can't really complain.Unlike the only similar game I can think of (Guns of Icarus) you as an individual can really change the tide of battle for your ship or team. A good crewman who is able to effectively kill enemies in ranged combat or while boarding can be the difference between you being sunk or the enemy getting a watery grave. Likewise, a good captain who can direct his crew to focus on tasks and not have tunnel vision is the key to success in this game.It's really the only game of its kind in the FPS genre of naval combat, and I think that's what had had me exited about it for years. Many developers these days are too afraid to stray from the path of 'generic game that makes money' like a cut and paste MMO with microtransactions - or a survival game; the market is so saturated with them it's getting a little stupid.The melee combat could use a little polish, but it serves its purpose.All in all I'd give it an 8/10 in its current state. If they build upon it, it could be one of the best games of its kind."

It is set with two factions one being Pirates the other being the British, this game has you working with other players, with one being a captain issuing orders and steering, while the crew obeys.Despite the games excellence there are flaws with the game. For instance the game revolves heavily around mutliplayer so if the game happened to lose population of players the game would practically die. The other flaw is that while i was playing i experienced many errors. The main predicament with the errors was how in the middle of a game it froze, causing me to either rejoin the server with all progress wiped (kills, score, ect) or for the game to stop completely. This has occurred throughout every game i have played, excluding my first brief 4 games.I am aware that this game is in alpha but that is no excuse in making it unplayable in the majority of games, making it virtually unentertaining.Overall i give this game a 8/10 in its current state. My recommendation would be for people to purchase this game in a few months, when the problem is cleared instead of now in its current state, where it has unreliable, and is still succepible to random errros."

It's a blast to play with friends and ultimately a very fun gamemode, but the game is severly lacking in content. I know the game is in early access, but I am reviewing the game in its current state. Being killed by cannons is fairly annoying because you don't have a chance to react to them - but I am unsure how they could best address this issue. When your ship eventually gets holes, it can be very difficult to find where they are so some form of damage map would go a long way. Teammates really make or break your experience. You must have a good captain and cooperative teammates to fully enjoy the pirate experience.This game has great potential and is a blast to play, but just know that you are stepping into a glitchy and unfinished game."

76561198042446636,Recommended,420290,30157094,Posted: 24 February,all,Heretical,"My rating is that the game is very good. It encourages use of the mic VERY heavily and something that i think is undermentioned is that good captain get picked again. This isn't a broken democracy, if a guy is a really good captain he is picked again by the people and the captain has HUGE HUGE impact on the game. You are the crew and the captain calls the shots. You make your own micro decisons such as repairing vs manning the pumps. If the sails are broken and no one goes to fix it, your ship isn't going anywhere anytime fast and the captain can bring attention to the problem and encourage people but whether you're that person or not, is your decision. You have to decide to man the cannons or to fix holes in the ship. You have to decide whether you want to jump onto the enemy ship with swords or chuck grenades and snipe enemies from your ship. You make the decision to man the cannon but the captain guides you. Is the game buggy? no. If framerate issues are really the only big problem in an early release game for $18, I mean is it a problem? I've seen early release games put out that hardly even run and have no reassurances that anything will be fixed or any apologies for releasing a broken game.The game has a framerate issue, the developer knows this and is working on it. There's a dumbass that said ""I told you about this problem last week before the release and that you should release a hot fix but you didn't listen so now you're going to get bad reviews."" Well yes this is true it's a known problem however the developers actually elaborated that this may be a problem rooted deep within unity and might take a bit to fix and not just a hot patch but the dumbass decided to post his comment anyways. The developers were really kind said we are working on this problem and it will get fixed and NO excuses. Nothing about how it's just two guys with a dream and not ubisoft or dice or equivalent corporation or complaints about lack of resources, just a promise and a heartfelt apology. That's ten times more than dice or ubisoft would do. That makes me want to throw money at them so they can do whatever they want, hookers and blackjack for all I care and makes me want to encourage you to do the same. But don't worry, it seems like they're too busy for hookers and blackjack."

You can tell the Devs spent the proper amount of time refining the core gameplay mechanics before trying to go crazy with features. I think the only reasonable compaint I could come up with currently is the lack of differing gamemodes, but the core game is so well made and enjoyable that is hardly a complaint at all. I'd rather play a well made game with 1-3 gamemodes, than a buggy game with 10 that crashes.I think more games need to be developed like Blackwake, and I'm excited to see the changes that the Devs bring to the tables in the coming months.Oh, and it has dedicated servers, which is something that shouldn't even have to praised anymore, its 2017, stop using P2P(cough boobisoft).

,Recommended,420290,30352859,Posted: 6 March,all,CBAR (GetS_ReKt)☯,"i can absolutely recommend this! reminds me alot of ""guns of icarus"" multicrew and the occasional roleplaying, drinking tea or rum in a circle together hehe. the only thing you notice is if your captain is using his voice-chat to keep his crew informed and on the tasks or not and if the crewmembers are just running around like headless chickens or if they get a position and stick to it to e.g. keep one gun per side firing and reloaded. rushing in with your ship as captain can also get you killed quite quickly especially if you re not in a galleon. constant log range sniping is also limited due to resources running low after some time, so no more powder and canonballs:) boarding can be confusing sometimes, so prepare to accidentially shoot some teammates in the heat of the battle, if you re new to the game, but you ll get into it soon enough"
,Recommended,420290,30356835,Posted: 6 March,all,Nick0Taylor,"In the current sate i would pay at least 30€ for this. It is better than most Early Acces games already and more compleate than games that have been in develoment for many years (*cough* Day Z *cough*) If the Developers keep up like this i can see this game competing with AAA games EASILY. Updates are frequent and content uptades will be free. IMO this game could be released in the current state but the developers really care about the project wich is rather rare these days. Buy it you will not regret it.And a little note to the Dev's if they will see this. Keep up the great work, this game is amazing. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for this game. I am sure i will play it for quite a while"

Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."

I only had to leave one match due to a guy continuously screaming in his mic. Most captains do a decent job and tell you what to do and what their strategy is.The future looks promising, as the devs seem very active and stated that there won't be any p2w microtransactions, which is really important for a game like this. So far there are only 2 ships, but as each battle is completely different I can't see it getting old anytime soon."

This is a very rare thing these days.Another thing is... PIRATES! ♥♥♥♥ING PIRATES! I mean, who doesn't like pirates?Anyway, moving on.

,Not Recommended,420290,34339870,Posted: 18 August,all,Kuuwahi,"Overview:Blackwake would be a fun game in a more mature and coordinating environment. However arming the cannons by inserting gunpowder, cannon balls then ramming and pushing the cannons starts to remove the satisfaction of firing them as you’re required to perform this tedious task over and over again, and even then somebody else could fire the cannon you spent time prepping before you.As coordination within your crew is essential all players must work together for a victory, however more often than not 50% or more of the crew spent most their time firing the same cannon and refusing to move to perform more important tasks.The heavy requirement of communication makes VOIP a very useful feature. This is negated by the continuous insults and racial remarks by immature players shouting down the microphone. If you manage to block everybody that is doing this, you’re still in a game where the ships names display the words / phrases you didn’t want to hear over VOIP.Performance:The overall performance was good with a few bugs throughout which didn’t break the gameplay.There was an issues with the UI not changing upon exiting the interaction with the object, which happened a few times, one of which was the “Pumping” overlay permanently being displayed on the screen. Alongside UI Issues that would display menu’s behind current UI rendering them unusable.The gun and melee mechanics felt clunky at the best of times. You’re unable to see how / where your shots are after being fired which prevents you from knowing how you need to adjust your aim for the next shot. Combined with lack of emphasis when successfully hitting a target, removed any sense of reward and left an empty feeling resulting in the gunplay feeling dull.Conclusion:Blackwake has the potential to be a great game. However it’s let down by tedious and clunky mechanics, immature / toxic players and a lack of progression, with no end goal in sight.Overall Score: 5/10Audio: 7/10Gameplay: 5/10Graphics: 6/10Performance: 5/10Replayability: 3/10Story: N/A"

Cannons used to auto fire on the range of the ship, depending on the waves rocking the ship.. Then we get a scroll wheel silly sight, and the next week and even worse sight on the cannons. I don't think the Devs have any understanding of how their game is played.  The best Captain wins.. everyone else scrambles around trying to do what the captain orders, without any sense of what the tactical situation is. You cannot ask people to aim when you need to fire all cannons on a side and you have a hammer in your hand.. Let me ask the Devs, um.... if you aren't on a full server what fun are you supposed to have? Do you understand how long it takes for a single person to aim and shoot the cannons on a gallion?Before this change I could join a server with 5 people on it and effectively run a ship, now you MUST have 54/54 people on all of the 2 full servers your game offers.. GOOD JOB WRECKING YOUR GAME.Before the aim change, having a 2v2 person battle was possible and entertaining...  Now it is IMPOSSIBLE.For a game with a total of 200 active online players at a time, I am surprised you decided to completely change the game mechanics.TLTR: The aiming mechanics made the game un-fun."

They really nailed this department. Everything from the sound of waves breaking on the ship to the creaking of a wooden ship clinging to a roiling sea for dear life! Cannon fire sounds great and when you land a hit it sounds/feels very, very satisfying! The music is something you would expect from Hans Zimmerman on a Pirates of the Caribbean movie, it just has that AAA Disney feel and serves the game perfectly.Controls: Keyboard and mouse function as expected, i can't comment on controllers since i haven't bothered to plug mine in and test it out. The melee combat definitely leaves something to be desired, but it has grown on me. To the point where i'm so used to it's clunky nature, that when they finally do get the chance to adjust it, it's going to throw off me boardin game ARRR!!! (I.E. you get used to it and it becomes a good kind of chaos)Performance: I didn't even want to include this since this is early access BUT, as of now iv'e had problems with FPS on the first day, it was patched in less than 24 hours... currently i noticed after a few games, the use of my mic lags the game out for a second and my voice comes out all garbled. After leaving and coming back it settles down but it seems to also cause a bit of lag. I would wager it's a memory leak and i'm sure they are working on it but it's a pain in the padded pantaloons!All in all this is a really good game, and a shining example of how to properly do steam early access! I have the utmost respect and faith in these developers and can plainly see their passion. Now start handin out tea matey, we be comin aboard YARRRRRR!!!!!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgZ9HDNfeU4"

76561198002567771,Recommended,420290,30473789,Posted: 12 March,all,Xenus Icelon,"Blackwake is a multiplayer naval game where the players crew ships and fight each other in often fast paced matches of positioning, skill at combat and teamwork.As an early access game, it mostly works off its basics- There remains very little in the way of content but what is there is enough to lead to many varied and interesting situations, often entirely different because of the reliance on player captains to steer the ships and individual tactics(Or lack of tactics) effecting almost everything about a battle.Currently, there is only what amounts to a deathmatch- Make the other team run out of respawns or cannonballs before they do the same to you. It is worth noting here that casualties are unavoidable at any range, as a lucky cannonball can and will hit people at almost any range, but this effect can be minimized by a good captain giving your ship good angles of attack while minimizing those of your opponent.Often it gets a bit hectic on larger ships, as everyone needs to get some information out at the same time- The rear sail is on fire while the captain yells to prepare for ramming and a gunner says they ran out of cannonballs and need someone to run supplies. Teamwork is surprisingly easy if people communicate, but with how the game and its systems are set up you will still need to try in order to do well. A few mistakes by the captain can put a lot of holes in your ship, which floods the gun deck and disables your cannons as they can't fire underwater.Many of the systems involved are simple, working well together to create the full experience. Flooding happens because you have holes, and water flow is not simulated. At the same time, supplies are a single resource, so you don't have a stock of regular cannonballs, gunpowder, grapeshot, and so on. Just supplies you can use. This is not bad, as the simple nature of these systems makes it easy to switch from one thing to the next- Load cannonballs and repair the hull without having to worry about the exact amount of wooden boards you have left (Repairing takes no resources), or the exact kind of ammo remaining.Although I personally enjoy these kind of details that the game leaves out, I fully understand and admit that they are not necessary for the game to be fun, and those with less of a mind for logistics and supply management may not enjoy them.As can be seen in the screenshots, it looks quite well. Several times of day and several weather types are available and make for varied looking rounds, with only two map variations that I've been able to find- Small islands and open sea. I've personally found the maps to be a bit small, but this is likely intentional to force confrontation so the players don't sail around without firing a single shot.All things considered, Blackwake is a very solid game already and seems to be getting regular patches. It currently only features a single game mode and two kinds of ships, but this is enough to be a very enjoyable experience already. At the very least, I would say it is worth the price."

,Recommended,420290,30217025,Posted: 27 February,all,Valhalla Awaits,"I stuggle to give this one a positive recommendation, it is indeed fun most of the time, and the ship combat is a blast with more levels of depth than you might expect. However the game suffers from ATROCIOUS fps combat in ship boardings. (Worse than anything I've ever played to this day.) The fps combat is unresponsive, imbalanced, and downright broken on every single level other than the the weapon killing the enemy (usually).Next up the game has a few poor game design choices (Not imbalances, just poorly concieved mechanics.) Such as cannonballs killing upto 6 players with a single shot due to them having a 30foot cone of death on impact. (There is absolutely no reason to ever use grapeshot, plain cannonballs are god.) Then you have respawn mechanics that make zero sense whatsoever, you respawn almost instantly, so healing foods are useless as they can take upto 15 seconds to fully heal you, so your better off suiciding every time.The game currently suffers some poor performance issues (to be expected) you will need a VERY high end pc to find this playable, the minimium specs for the game are actually a gtx 960, and thats if 30 fps is acceptable to you. My Titan Ultimate pulls in around 130fps (average not minimum) despite this game's very ancient graphics. (Think Halflife 2) Server peformance has issues as well.Animations are AWFUL, fps is dreadfully bad to outright broken, graphics are circa 2006 with exception to the water which is 2012 or so, and the game is obviously buggy as hell, but despite all this, I've had a lot of fun so far, this game won't have a long lifespan and will likely be a ghost town in 3 months, and I can guarantee will never see a launch date. But atm I feel like I got my money's worth out of it, I've laughed and cheered far more than I've cursed at the game, and thats a damn good sign.So I ""cautiously"" recommend the game, as long as you know what your getting into."
,Recommended,420290,30170377,Posted: 25 February,all,Tea,"There's a lot of great potential for this game, although at its current state it's very sloppy. The FOV slider past 90 is actually the Ctulhu slider and the melee is super weird. Other gripes too such as no tutorial, clipping through teammate models and smaller gripes such as being able to look around while you're repairing holes in your ship.It's very fun when things are going well and you're running a tight ship. There is a very exciting tension in the air when the captain tells you to get ready dockside and you are aiming your cannon waiting for the enemy ship.Communication makes or breaks this game. The community will be an important part of keeping this game alive.Without voice comms, the ship can get quite troublesome to deal with. As a captain, you don't know if your gunners think you should angle the ship. As a crew, you need to tell your captain what you need as well. As an experience, Blackwake will heavily rely on player communication.Unfortunately the game at the moment doesn't have that much content other than straight ticket-based 'DM' PvP. There are hats though so Dota 2 fans will feel right at home. The shocking female pirate customization is game-breaking though (only 1 hairstyle??)When you pretty much know all there is to do as a pirate, the flow can feel a bit too chore-y. Hopefully future patches will add more content and things to manage. This problem isn't as pronounced when playing as a captain, but in a TDM 3v3 game, only 6 out of roughly 60 people will play as captain.The point of this game is that the fight to sink each other's ships will create many tasks for your crew to manage and coordinate. Naturally, the game gets quite boring when you have a terrible captain or are stomping the enemy so hard because they don't know how to play.--The menus are barebones, to the point where the server browser doesn't have a scroll bar, but instead has a ""Scroll Up"" and ""Scroll Down"" buttons. As a first impression, the menus really scared me off for a minute, until I got into the servers.For the price, I don't mind this game at all. Don't be afraid to use the Steam Refunds system to check this game out - I was all ready to refund the purchase when I landed on the menu screen (it is an alpha though), but the game was actually pretty fun.This game will live or die by its playerbase though. So keep that in mind when thinking of buying this game."

Sword and gunplay, despite playing with 30 ping, are delayed and aren't fluid whatsoever.

The core focus is the naval warfare, which has been brilliantly excecuted via the strong mechanics. The community is great, the servers seem okay, and the developers are working actively with the game. If this game continues to recieve updates, and the developers continue to help make it a great experience, I would really highly recommend it to anyone who wants a game which finds a perfect balance between fun and serious.9/10"

76561197971015231,Recommended,420290,32380615,Posted: 12 June,all,Jaggy,"I write few reviews, but I wanted to put in a good word for this game.Firstly, this game more then met my hopes and expectations.  I was dubious because it tries to do many things and seemingly faces some huge tech hurdles for such a small team, but it does deliver.  I think it's the best naval combat experience out there, even in it's slightly buggy not quite polished EA form.But more noteworthy, it's the first game where teams have captains/squad leaders/commanders/whatever that really lives up to the primise of that feature/structure.  A good captain makes the game great fun.  A crew that all works together wins much more often then not, and crews where everyone ♥♥♥♥s off and does their own thing do fail and fail hard.Perhaps it's the fact that this game does not have the hundreds of thousands of players that Battlefield and the like have, and so it's a self selecting community of people who really want to give it a go, but in my first 4-5 hours I've had almost entirely crews that do work, and it's been great. I'm happy to man the guns and patch the leaks and help board etc.  I'll captain a ship eventually, but first I have more learning to do.  As it should be.So, if you are on the fence, as I was for a while, I hope I can nudge you to get on board, it's a lot of fun."

After he told me he was done he pushed the cannon forward, I looked away for 2 seconds and the ship rattled everywhere, I looked to my new friend only to find a wide open hole where the cannon was. I jumped off the pump and onto the cannon, I waited for them to get into my sights......FIRE! and must've killed half the enemy crew! soon afterwards we were boarded by the other enmy ship, and slowly sunk down to davy jones locker.game is super fun! 9.5/10some glitches here and there but wow you will look over those small problems because of the carnage on a ship with your crewmates."

Especially for an Alpha, seeing it's already very well done. Some may say that it's repetitive, which I can understand, but it's the kind of repetitive that you don't mind. It's very entertaining to get a nockgun and, as you are boarding with grapples, fire upon the enemy cannoneers. Or perhaps you're a stowaway, and you want to hide on the enemy galleon just to shoot their captain in the back of the head with your duckfoot pistol. Maybe you want to drink tea with your fellow comrades while repairing your ship and relentlessly firing cannons at a temporarily immobilized Schooner. Maybe you want to take the chance and board the sinking enemy schooner by ramming it. Maybe you want to hold Z and spam three (IE yelling an elongated charge).TL;DR, It's very well done for an alpha, you can drink tea, you get to shoot cannons, and you get to annoy your team mates by spamming a phrase.

As a captain, you must assign these tasks and command a crew of real people to keep your ship in working order while destroying the enemy ships, all whilst steering around friendlies and into firing positions.This game can feel like working a job, but it can also feel like winning the Superbowl. The variety of players you will meet and work with as a team makes or breaks your ability to win. Only by working together as a well-oiled machine, by doing what needs done for the ship over what you want to do, can you reign victorious in this game.PROS:- amazing community of players- intensely satisfying when played well- simple roles to follow / easy to learnNEUTRAL:- you should get a mic to play this game- lots of repetetive actions as a crew member- still an Alpha game, getting betterCONS:- if your crew / captain sucks, so will the game- some racism ocasionally observed- not many game variantsTLDR:Blackwake is fun. Buy if you want to play an intense team-based game!"

I love seeing some fly in the sky or be invisiable but right next to me... Capt is on the wheel but does not show him there...  I shelved this game and just tried almost a hour and wow so many stop playing this game and the ones left are cranky people and  people griefing others. Most captains have no clue what to do and so many people love voting to kick everyone... This game will never recover it is a doomed ship of toxic slime. The die hard people will be around scaring off the new people until nobody is left to play against.  The FOV is the worst thing about this game looks like i am looking through some beer bottles. I wish i can get a refund i am done buying early access games this one was the worst i bought and time will not change that.

The game allows you to perform your own roles and style of play (officially as Captain or Crew member, but you can decide if you want to focus on repairing, shooting cannons, etc), while also allowing different ways to attack enemy ships. You can also communicate with the other ships, allowing you to stragetize with other captains and seamen.In the current game mode, you have to choose to be the British team or the Pirate team. Each team has 3 ships (2 small ships and a large ship). You have to work together to maintain your ship and sink the other teams ships. If your ship is sunk, it eventually respawns. Once a team is out of tickets, they lose.The game currently has a levelling system that allows you to unlock apparels/cosmetics for your character.The devs have been really active on their forums, promising a great early access experience.The game is still early in development but it offers solid gameplay for such an early stage."

For other uses, see Dirt (disambiguation).""Dirty"" redirects here. For other uses, see Dirty (disambiguation).The inside of this computer over time has accumulated a lot of dust and has become dirty.Dirty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ a pub in Bishopsgate, London, named after a former owner, the notoriously filthy Dirty♥♥♥♥♥♥Dirt is unclean matter, especially when in contact with a person's clothes, skin or possessions when they are said to become dirty. Common types of dirt include:dust — a general powder of organic or mineral matterfilth — foul matter such as excrementgrime — a black, ingrained dust such as sootsoil — the mix of clay, sand, and humus which lies on top of bedrockContents  [hide]1	Exhibitions and studies2	Cleaning3	Disposal4	Health5	Neurosis6	References7	Further reading8	External linksExhibitions and studiesA season of artworks and exhibits on the theme of dirt was sponsored by the Wellcome Trust in 2011. The centrepiece was an exhibition at the Wellcome Collection showing pictures and histories of notable dirt such as the great dust heaps at Euston and King's Cross in the 19th century and the Fresh Kills landfill which was once the world's largest landfill.[1]CleaningWhen things are dirty they are usually cleaned with solutions like hard surface cleaner and other chemicals solutions; much domestic activity is for this purpose — washing, sweeping and so forth.[2]In a commercial setting, a dirty appearance gives a bad impression. An example of such a place is a restaurant. The dirt in such cases may be classified as temporary, permanent, and deliberate. Temporary dirt is streaks and detritus that may be removed by ordinary daily cleaning. Permanent dirt is ingrained stains or physical damage to an object, which require major renovation to remove. Deliberate dirt is that which results from design decisions such as decor in dirty orange or grunge styling.[3]DisposalAs cities developed, arrangements were made for the disposal of trash through the use of waste management services. In Britain, the Public Health Act 1875 required households to place their refuse into a container which could be moved so that it could be carted away. This was the first legal creation of the dustbin.[4]HealthModern society is now thought to be more hygienic . Lack of contact with microorganisms in dirt when growing up is hypothesised to be the cause of the epidemic of allergies such as asthma.[5] The human immune system requires activation and exercise in order to function properly and exposure to dirt may achieve this.[6] For example, the presence of staphylococcus bacteria on the surface of the skin regulates the inflammation which results from injury.[7]Even when no visible dirt is present, contamination by microorganisms, especially pathogens, can still cause an object or location to be considered dirty. For example, computer keyboards are especially dirty as, on average, they contain 70 times more microbes than a lavatory seat.[8]People and animals may eat dirt. This is thought to be caused by mineral deficiency and so the condition is commonly seen in pregnant women.NeurosisPeople may become obsessed by dirt and engage in fantasies and compulsive behaviour about it, such as making and consuming mud pies and pastries.[9] The source of such thinking may be genetic, as the emotion of disgust is common and the location for this activity in the brain has been proposed.[10]ReferencesJump up ^ Brian Dillon (23 March 2011), ""Dirt: the Filthy Reality of Everyday Life, Welcome Collection"", The Daily TelegraphJump up ^ Mindy Lewis (2009), Dirt: The Quirks, Habits, and Passions of Keeping House, ISBN 9781580052610Jump up ^ John B.

This game is however, plauged by trolls who try to sabotage and disrupt, and parties of hostile boyfriends that abuse the mutiny and votekick system.  The trolling can be so bad that it puts many players off the game.  It does vary from server to server though.  I noticed the Booty Bay servers are the worse for trolling and any American server in general.  The Night Watch server has good mods that take out the trash and the UK, and German servers tend to have a much better community of players.  Your ping doesnt have to be great to play this game so pick it up and join the European servers."

At the moment I have my issues and I guess I will be the black sheep amongst the 80% positive reviews.-The game is only really fun if you are captain as all other positions are typically mundane tasks with little to no satisfaction.  If you do not have friends who have also paid $20 you will not be captain. Like, ever.-No population.  Servers are just plain empty or half full.  Said population has been...undesirable.-Game is wonky as hell on so many levels.Long story short - Black Wake is a great game with some serious potential that simply falls short of its price tag at the moment.  At $20 bucks I have to go thumbs down as there are so many fantastic, already developed games in the Steam library at comparable prices."

Pour into prepared tin and smooth top. Bake for 1 hour or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Allow to cool in the tin. If not using at once, the cake will keep for about a week in a sealed container in the fridge. You can also freeze it uniced.When you are ready to ice the cake, slather chilled Chocolate Ganache over the top. Top with fresh raspberries and serve.Variation:To make chocolate cupcakes, preheat oven to 160°C and line 24 muffin pans with paper cases. Prepare cake batter according to the instructions for The Ultimate Chocolate Cake (see above). Spoon mixture into the paper cases, filling about two thirds full. Bake for 25-30 minutes. Cool before icing. For icing, beat 200g firm cream cheese with 100g softened butter until smooth. Gradually beat in 2 cups icing sugar until smooth and creamy. Add a few drops of food colouring to get the desired colour. Icing can be stored in the fridge in a sealed container for up to a week. Pipe onto the cakes and top with confectionery sprinkles.

,Recommended,420290,30464320,Posted: 11 March,all,λuzEll,"Blackwake.The naval FPS combat simulator that introduced one of the most original and exciting ideas to competitive gaming since Dead By Daylight. It's a brilliant idea for a competitive PC game that to be honest, took way too long to release.So in Blackwake, you are fighting for the side of either the Navy or the Pirates, the game places you on a ship in the sea somewhere near Britain with another 7 people (max) and you must take down the other team's ship(s). Gamemodes as of this time only reflect the amount of ships on each team. On your ship, one player is elected Captain, whose job is to steer the ship and give the orders. The rest of crew take control over the rest of the ship. There are cannons located on the left and right (and on some occasions at the front) which you can load with cannonballs, grapeshots or grapples. There are also swivel cannons (normally located on the front) which you can use to shoot out enemy ship's sails. Each player also carries a few items along with them. Generally the players are equipped with a musket, a pistol, a cutlass, a cup of tea or bottle of rum, and a repair hammer. The first 3 items are used for fighting, the drinks are for healing and the repair hammer is for the obvious.So there are a number of options you can take to bring down enemy ships. The cannons can be used to destroy and eventually sink emeny ships if gone long enough without repairs. Repairing the ship can be done by equipping the repair hammer to find and fix the holes notified, while the pump(s) located somewhere on the ship needs to be used to extract the water. Other options of destroying enemy ships include ramming into them. This deals damage to the ship while also possibly killing memebers of their crew. This also creates access to board ships allowing for players to engage in hand to hand combat against each other. Another option is grappling the enemy ship which puts the ship members into an elimination deathmatch to potentially set a game.Aside from the game's originality and combat system, one area where this competitive game shines is in its teamwork. There is never a point in the game where a crew member ISN'T doing something. The only way for a ship to escape victoriously is to have consistent communication and contribution to the team. Every member must always be setting themselves with tasks to reloading and firing cannons, repairing and pumping, resupplying, using the swivel cannons, all while the captain is the one with all responsibility, steering the ship and giving clear orders and game plans for pulling their team through to the end.Blackwake is, in my opinion a true masterpiece for teamwork-based gameplay and fitting into the competitive playstyle. Of all the games out there where the people who give guides on how to play state that a mic is necessary to success, Blackwake is by NO MEANS an exception. At the moment the only issues I have with it is its lack of servers. Especially in Australia, you'll only find about 3 or 4 that actually have players in them. There's also no matchmaking in its current Alpha, but I don't not to expect too much of an indie game that hasn't even been released for a month yet. Regardless, I would HIGHLY recommend Blackwake to anyone interested in competitive or heavily teamwork-based games at all. Or if you just like intense, original and/or fun playstyles, this is your game. I'd also strongly recommend it if you're a fan of Dead By Daylight. (A strangely large portion of Blackwake's playerbase is from DBD for some reason)Overall, Blackwake earns a 7.5/10 from me. It's strong in terms of concept, originality, playstyle and its comfortable fit into competitive gameplay. Weak in terms of servers and matchmaking. But even with the cons, the devs have been releasing patches and updates to the game almost every day, which is some serious dedication and support to their work. So keep it up, guys!"

,Not Recommended,420290,30946199,Posted: 4 April,all,The Carton,"Blackwake itself is a remarkably complete alpha with a refreshing concept horribly marred by an almost intolerable community. The awfulness of the people who play this game is exacerbated by the baffiling decision to let any player broadcoast their horrible microphones to everyone on the server. I'd guess about half of games have a ship named with a racial slur or some sexist tripe.The captain system is poorly executed. The player who steers the ship is elected and called captain. The problem is at the beginning of the game, often only one person runs. So what really frustrates me is that I never run for captain because I have no interest with talking to these people, yet since I'm fairly high level I often get appointed after the captain leaves since no one else ran. When this happens, I'm rarely given a chance to do my job.The most aggravating example of this is when I was appointed captain, mutined for being captain while the ship sank as I ran to the wheel, mutined twice more, and then votekicked because the mutinies didn't work. I was captain for less than 5 minutes. There's no way I could have done anything in 5 minutes to warrant that. Direct democracy is a terrible idea when the voters are on average ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s with no information and often trolls.Making a game about teamwork and then having no meaningful system to keep the trolls at bay is not something that can be fixed with later features. I hope I'm wrong because I want to like this game, but if you create a culture of sexism, racism, and troll-celebration now boarding pikes later aren't going to help."

If you're not the captain all you do is load and time cannon shots.  There is some boarding of ships here and there but not often enough.  Scrap the ships and make a TDM mode.  It'll be fun watching everyone reload for five mins after they miss a shot.

I jad 2 friends who bought it, they refunded it because of the same reason, and why would I keep a game that i have no friends playing it. I have high hopes for this project and good luck with it.

Wow.I almost just threw a ♥♥♥♥in haymaker through my custom gaming tower a moment ago. Basically I was on a ship with about 3 teenage ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dudes trolling below deck spamming cannons as soon as they were reloaded and I said something and all three broke out ""♥♥♥♥ YOU! YOUR THE ONE DOING IT! BLAH! BLAH!""Long story short the captain took their side and since this is the internet the home to ♥♥♥♥♥♥s and little ♥♥♥♥ boy ♥♥♥♥♥♥s♥♥♥♥♥muther  ♥♥♥♥ers I was left with rising blood pressure and no human being infront of me to murder with my bare ♥♥♥♥ing hands.

They sound like the type to read Barrenstien bears stories up until they're 20 years old.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Community needs to be rounded up, loaded into the back of a truck, and dropped off in the wastelands just outside of Detroit with a smudged almost unreadable map leading them to a bus stop that may or may not still be on a route. Need I say more? ♥♥♥♥in ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥little ♥♥♥♥ boy ♥♥♥♥♥ muther♥♥♥♥ers.Post Script -In solidarity with my original findings I will leave this a thumbs down. A few more detailed notes unmuddied with raw hatred follow.Gameplay is unique and fun but gets alittle old. You load cannons over and over again and repair holes over and over again and where this game really shines is BOARDING! But sadly this is a rare occurence and the combat mechanics are REALLY stiff and clunky and pretty bad. You can be captain if your into that but this community is so touch and go Idk if Id wanna put up with the headaches that would come with doing that and all you do anyway is sail and turn and sail and turn and say ""fire!"" or ""DID I SAY FIRE!? Seriously guys Im getting ♥♥♥♥ing sick of this and I swear Ill leave!"" (actual quote from a captain lol).Alot rides on having a good captain. This game can be pretty fun with a good captain but with a limp dicked beta male leading the crew with no microphone or idea on how to sail immediately ruins the experience. Turns will be too quick and the delay between lighting the fuse on the cannon and the actual shot will be a sure miss with a tard at the helm. Or you'll spawn on a vessel and captainency will get passed around like a drunken ♥♥♥♥♥ on the 4th of july in a rural BBQ somewhere in El Paso and you'll be left with your♥♥♥♥♥♥in your hands minus the motor functions to jerk it.Yes, there are alot of idiots in the community. Alot of weird racist/vulgar/political ship names and alot of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥preteens, little kids, trolls, and 17 year olds all bowed up thinking they're men becuase they saw their first pube that morning. Alot of people not loading cannons and just standing behind you and when its loaded they jump in and steal it or just slap it with their fuse and blind fire wasting a shot. I met ONE DUDE who seemed pretty cool and we were riffing in salty pirate voices and barking at eachother and it was actually pretty fun and not weird and akward like having a captain make a little 13 year boy sing assasins creed black flag songs in a sqeeky breaking voice non stop for matches.I have to give some credit though. There ARE a small handful of people who are good captains and another small handful who play to win and have fun while actually trying. Having at least 2 players with mics on one ship who are there to have fun but also win have a weird effect on the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and they fall in line. Now when I play it takes me 2 seconds to learn whether a ship is♥♥♥♥♥♥or not and if it is I suicide, jump off the bow, switch teams a million times, whatever I can do to stop myself from getting subjected to the fun killing madness inducing idiot retard ADHD♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥potty humor teenage virgin diaries of narcissism that makes me wanna chew glass until my lower jaw falls off.This games enjoyment level and cieling remind me of assasins creed black flag, it was AWESOME and dope doing the pirate thing for the first handful of hours but then it turned into a rinse and repeat. This one has alittle more variation but I can see myself getting real bored after 20+ hours.Anyway its early access so this game could be the best thing on earth 2-6 months from now but at the moment its a fun experience and its something new but isnt really fleshed out and the combat is weak. Something about the concept attracts alot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s so be ready for that."

Any possibility for teamwork, let alone functioning as a crew goes out the window in that scenario.There's no drowning in the game, I've stood on the lower deck of a sinking ship operating a bilge pump whilst completely submerged for minutes at a time.

,Not Recommended,420290,30208830,Posted: 26 February,all,CRUCIAL 000 - YT,"I've been playing this game for about 30 minutes and my opinion is that it's close to awful. I had a bit of fun playing, but the graphics are terrible, the fps is all over the place (low), and there's many graphical bugs and glitches.I was interested in the game and after reading the reviews I decided it would be a smart purchase, luckily I only lost $17 on this game or I would be immediately looking for a refund.LESSON LEARNED: The review section is full of shilling for the game, not worth $17 right now IMO, but maybe in a few months it will be.I won't be returning to play this game until its fixed.Edit: I was a bit hot yesterday when posting this review, I was so disapointed with Blackwake that I wrote a short review. Here are some more of my concerns with this game.My biggest gripe is the character animations, they are very poor and glitchy. The hit detection is awful and 90% of the time I can't tell if my rifle/gun is hitting its target. The cannon shots are bad as well, the damage when a cannonball hits the ship is glitchy and awful looking. The sounds and look from damage on ships or characters is just way way bad, I haven't seen something this bad in a game for a long time. And yes I understand this game is EARLY ACCESS, but its more like EARLY RIPOFF.I personally think the review section is full of shills or rationalizers (people who buy a turd and shine it up real nice and lie to themselves about what it reall is). After reading the reviews I thought to myself, ""Wow, there's no way this could be a bad purchase! Everyone loves this game!""Within 5 minutes I knew it was bad, and it only got worse. There is no rhyme or reason to what you are doing, just running around on a ship with 8 silent people, and 2 loud mouth idiots trying to imitate a pirate voice. The sounds are really bad too, and very annoying.I will load this game up in a few weeks, I plan to wait until some serious patches are applied. I don't have much faith this game can be fixed, its just SOOOOO BAD right now...I really don't get the reviews, the gameplay is ok...but thats it....so I DO NOT RECCOMEND BUYING THIS GAME if you are looking for an actual game to play...."

After the first few hours of playing it gets so repetitive just loading cannons.  The game is only a little bit exiting if you are the captain of the ship, but this happens rarely.  I also do not recomend this game because the price tag is too much, $20 for a game where you only get a few hours of enjoyment is not worth it to me.  Another issue is the progression system.  You do not really unlock anything by leveling up other than a few hats and uniforms, which are very similar to eachother.I hope you found this review useful."

That's sometimes after 30min+ of essentially stalemate, repeating the same exact actions over and over. (At least in 1v1, honestly didn't try 3v3 but I imagine other than for the captains it's more of the same.)You can literally just go AFK on the pump the whole game and get a top 5 score.If you don't like wasting time on dull repetitive tasks without anything tangible to show for it (except a number by your name on a score screen/server).If you don't like slow, boring, monotonous combat where it takes 30+ seconds to reload a gun.Also the voice acting for callouts is mediocre at best, nail on chalkboard annoying at worst...Save your money.If you love pirate ships and cannons (even if you very often don't get to even SEE what you're hitting).

I can't recommend it right now though.The gameplay is simply awful. All the weapons seem to have little enviromental effect. Ramming into another boat doesn't really feel like you've done anything. Many times you just suddenly die and you have no idea why except that it tells you. Get hit in the head by gunfire... *black screen Get hit by cannon fire..... you're just suddenly upside down and you don't really know what happened.Most matches consist of a usually obnoxious captain constatnly ramming his boat into other boats and yelling. The majority of the action goes like this: ram boat into opponent, repair holes, pump water out, repeat.The mutiny that everyone seems to think is awesome... Guess what, it's just a vote button on screen. Give the players the option ot actually attack the captain or throw him overboard. It's a pirate game for ffs and I never felt like a pirate. The only pirate like think about the game is everyone on voice chat doing their awful pirate accent.Bottom line, do not purchase this game in it's current state. It should be a f2p at the moment."

I honestly don't think it's worth over $10.Here are my ratings:OVERALL: 4/10Vehicles: 8/10- The boats are pretty dang realistic!Cannon shooting: 4/10- Realistic but not fun at all. There's no aiming up, down, left, or right. Just straight. Also the loading is too complex.Gunplay: 2/10- Really bad gunplay. Yea it's realistic, but you can't even aim in with half of the weapons, and they don't give you a crosshair so it makes it hard to shoot. Shooting in general is weird, it feels as if my arms are seperate from my body, which is not good.Graphics: 6/10- Really bad optimizations for such simple graphics. Boats look ok though.. I guess.Controls: 5/10- Honestly really glitchy sometimes. Picking up the chest is lame because once you pick it up, you can't drop it, nor can you be healed. So you basically bleed out.In conclusion, DO NOT buy this game for $20. Not even $15. Not only does the game have a dying population, but I'm pretty sure these developers will abandon the game once Sea of Thieves comes out."

Teamwork really pays off and strategic planning and shooting allows you to even crush high level players.

This is the main reason I refunded the game.Here are some notes to consider:1- More content!- Storyline would be great but isn't needed.- MORE GAMEMODES!- Signs to show new players what to do when they first start off- Maybe an ability to join a ship with a squad of friends instead of trying to join it separately? A enable/disable feature for   something like this would be nice.- Different ships, customization- Maybe even add customizable ships?- Animations when climbing up or down a sail- Animations for swimming in the water- Maybe you could add cannonballs that are set on fire?2- Bugs- Can't reassign VOIP keys to mouse keys.- Couldn't walk into the back of the small ship when it's lopsided; only able to do so when crouched- The game starts off in windowed mode with small resolution. The fullscreen box is clicked, but you need to reclick it to enable fullscreen.I had another point in the other review but I forgot.Overall - please know that this game is really fun! I loved it, but it got boring after a while. I know it is in early access, so for now I will be refunding it. Hopefully more stuff is added because I'm really looking forward to it. For now, I rate it 3/5.Thank you for the good game. I'll be keeping an eye on it to see how it progresses and whether or not I should buy it again.--------------------------------------EDIT 3/11/2017Please don't misinterpret my review. I'm not angry about anything. I had a lot of fun within the first hour of gameplay but it ended up being the same thing over and over again.I stated in the review that I know it's early access, and knowing that, it will obviously be missing some features.  However at the same time, there is never a guarantee that developers will continue with a game, as stated in the ""Early Access"" description.The point of early access is so you can get a feel of how a game will turn out. My review was only so developers could have an idea of what some people would like to have implemented in their game.Sadly, steam only allows you to recommend or not recommend a game. That is why I marked it as 3/5. The repetitive concept is something that deterred me from continuing to play.I'm looking forward for the future of this game. I've learned from past experiences to never get hyped up for a game, so that is why I refunded. As more content comes out, I'd be glad to check it out again. But for now, I will this game refunded in case I dislike it in the future. When more things come out that I would like, I'll consider buying this game again.I understand that people would be upset by this review -- but it was not written in any way to insult the game at its current state, nor the developers. It was simply written to encourage developers to think about more features, as I am sure they already are, as well as address other issues within the game.Developers -- this was a great game. Keep doing what you are doing. I'm looking forward to playing this in the future. I know I marked this as something I would not recommened -- but that is simply due to the repetitive structure of it, and so that you guys can notice what parts of the game you should improve on. Good luck with your developmental process. I understand it is a hard and tedious. For now, this game will stay refunded, but it will definitely still be on my radar."

It has some stability issues that I expect to get fixed. I had it refunded because I felt like I would quickly stop enjoying it after 2 hours. Right now the game is great if you have friends that own it but as a solo player joining a server is like playing russian roulette. You might get with a good crew, or not. You might get into epic naval fights, or just end up watching your captain sail nowhere close any action for several minutes and then proceed to ram into another ship and let you enjoy a whopping 10 seconds fight then you die, ship respawns, rince, repeatTL;DR: Too much waiting sailing around doing nothing, too much relying on 1 guy to set up a good naval fight"

What I am going to focus on is the things that most likely will make it into the final game such as the gameplay. The gameplay is quite honestly half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at best. All the guns take a ridiculous amount of time to reload. Now before you go ""Hurr durr its the stone age man what do you expect????"". Your character takes his sweet time slowly loading his weapon and if at any moment you stop or get stopped by something like water, boom you have to start all over again. It is actually faster to kill yourself, respawn, and shoot, than it is to reload your gun. And worst of all the hitboxes in this game are pretty dogshit. Most of the time if you line up a shot it just won't register at all. And most of the game just invovles you running around fixing♥♥♥♥♥♥for 10 seconds at a time and running back to fix something else, grabbing more ammo, or loading the cannons. For every minute of actual combat, 10 minutes have been used preparing for it. Your character movement is slow and clunky, jumps are a joke, and match lengthtimes are ridiculously long and repetitive.Only get this now if your dream game is to be a handyman that gets to shoot once a minute.If you have ever played Doom 2016 before, it is almost the exact opposite of this game. Doom is optimized, fast paced, satisfying, dynamic, has great graphics, and gameplay. Blackwake has none of that. Getting a kill has barley any impact, all you get are points that help you level up that gets you cosmetics. It's a game where you just ♥♥♥♥ around and let out your inner autist. If you go into this game with expectations of something like Goat Simulator you will be happy. Devs update basically everyday it's priced as an indie game and at times the graphics do look good. But if you go in after playing some legendary AAA titles, prepare for disappointment and get ready to ask for a refund.Anyways if the devs actually read the reviews, I will give them respect for updating constantly and addressing issues that the community highlights.

There is not much to do other than fire cannons on a captains orders or step back a few steps to pump water. The game is not engaging but more like a cluster of bs going on. If you manage to find a competent crew then you lose even more fun as the game now is monotoned along the lines of fire now and  then ship sinks *small yay's erupt* move on.  If you board gl hitting anyone as slashing and seing blood does not mean you have actually hit anyone. I would say if this game were 5 dollars it would be worth it but as it stands now you might get a weeks worth of enjoyment out of it. If that is worth 20 dollars to you then so be it but for 60 I can get many more weeks than that.

There is no cannon articulation here so you're 100% reliant on a captain when aiming cannons. Firing a cannon literally consists of lighting it and waiting 2 seconds for it to fire, then loading it and repeating. They've managed to reduce the role of manning a cannon to literally pressing a button and waiting two seconds in hopes that your captain can hold a 90 degree angle. Could have been great, really poor decision making ruins it. All anyone needs to do is load up (free on steam) Air Buccaneers to know how to model cannon gameplay. This is completely prostrated."

The fact that the devs are asking for such a steep pricepoint for this piece of trash game with no content blows my mind. Don't even get me started on the lackluster autistic community of yellow teethed British losers who can barely even role play a pirate (unless you count their teeth in real life), stick to playing quidditch at hogwarts you worthless beans.Also ignore all the low tier sellout reviews like "" I can beeez a pirate R) 11/10 ign (upboat me please)"" All these trash reviews are 100% buyers remorse so pay little attention to these feeble minded buffoons.

I HIGHLY recommend having some sort of tutorial system so idiots that first start know what to do instead of never learning until they are rank 10. People that were rank 12 still didn't know where the supply room was.2. When boxs are empty show where the supply room is for all players so they can easily find the crates (not necessary if a tutorial is implemented).3. Fire underwater is a big annoyance and I'm sure you all are working on fixing that.4. When the smaller ships are sinking you can get stuck in the door way to the supply room, another thing I'm sure is getting fixed.I'm excited to see how this game will evolve, had an absolute blast so far!"

I have gone games getting some nice scores of 6 or more kills and 8 assists. Then on some other games missed like 6 times in a row like a total noob. Weapons take a lot longer to reload as they did in the time period the game is set so it becomes less of an fps free for all.The good thing is the points given are based on participation not K/D ratio. Manning the pumps, repairing holes, repairing sails, restocking, etc.... every positive team based action gets you points. All weapons are unlocked at the start so you can choose your own loadout and everyone starts at an even position.The focus of the entire game is on teamwork but there is a bit of humour mixed in and lots of surprises. Your Captain counts down to shoot the enemy boat... 3... 2... 1... you're dead... they shot first...BAH!"

Its a game about Piracy, Silly accents in which every British person sounds like Nigel Thornberry, and intense multiplayer action. For an early access game, it runs really smoothly and feels well polished. The graphics are very nice and the combat is smooth and fluid. If you want to sail around drinking tea and sinking enemy ships, this is the game for you."
,Recommended,420290,30470552,Posted: 12 March,all,Linetrap,"All in all, great game that so far I am loving. If you are considering buying though, this is early access, remember you are buying a promise that may not be fulfilled, but I've already got my moneys worth so far.Pros:The gameplay is hectic and requires team play to really come out on top, a bit more in line with actual naval combat. If a cannon is going to hit you, you arent going to see it coming and it wont be pretty.The game is actually surprisingly fair and balanced, and while there are a multitude of weapons for your character it really comes down to how your crew operates on the ship.Positive roleplay is rife mainly due to the setting. Its hard to be loading cannons together and not get into the mood for the pirate life and living up to it.ConsThere isn't that much to the game yet, you are going to be using the same items and doing the same things game in game out for now.The none ship combat is rough, sluggish and outright awful. Swinging your sword is like dragging your arms through tar and the hit detection seems well off.The racism, oh god the racism. Yes I know, its steam, but with the games kick feature, you needan obscenely large number of people to vote to kick to remove somebody from your entire team, but 9 times out of 10 only your ship will be putting up with the person so nobody else can hear what is going on. They really need to give ships the power to kick individually."

As our ship collides with the pirates hoy the fps drops to 2 and i hold my breath, the frame rate returns to normal only for me to discover that I died.Its ok in a matter of seconds I respawn just as our ship sinks into the briney depths I try to climb aboard the pirate ship only to be shot while in the water.The HMS cumbucket pride of his majestys fleet respawns with a full compliment of crew and we head out towards the fight, one of my fellow crew members tell the captain to turn to the left so we can unleash our broadside onto the unsuspecting pirates, however the captains mind is set we will ram again! a hail of gunfire is unleashed upon us as we close the distance killing me again and several holes appear in our vessal just as i respawn we make contact I leap aboard the enemy ship and fire my musket however the game is so laggy and the sight so tiny I miss the shot! worry not I have a pistol, I fire point blank into a charging pirate only to have him nimbly lag to the left at the last second, as my shot bursts through the deck i draw my blade i slice at him but it takes me over 9000 seconds to swing my blade and he lags behind me chopping me in the back I try to turn around but my frame rate is dropping I make a run for it and pull out my trusty bottle of rum I take a healing sip just to bleed out a nanosecond before the healing bar is full. Our ship goes down and I wait to respawn.At this point we mutiny our young captain and appoint a new one we set sail again this time aboard the valient ship known as Ihaten*ggers. It takes us a while to get into the action and just as our captain lines up a devestating broadside upon the enemy galley everything freezes for about 10 seconds then the game ends the server says it is restarting, it crashes i'm placed back in the main menu.

A game that is easy to learn, and even easy to master if you only account for individual ability. But this game is all about TEAM WORK. It's just you, your ship and your crew; every player must do their part. Or sink to the bottom of the sea.Pros- A visceral experience. The sounds of crashing waves, cannons firing, seamen screaming orders and the ambient sounds of warfare in the sea. All this in sync with the incredibly dynamic team-oriented gameplay; makes for some of the most immersive online experiences in recent memory(For me).- Relatively polished for early access standards. In fact, in almost 10hrs of gameplay; I've yet to see a single bug. But it does have it's missing or lacklustre features, typical of EA titles.- Easy to get into. Many competitive games have the tendency to have steep learning curves, this game can be learned in a matter of minutes. But that is not to say this is a simple and non-competitive game; BLACKWAKE is one of the most team-oriented strategy games I have ever played.- Beautiful visuals. Glimmering seas, rain crashing on the deck, gentle snow in the midst of battle, thunderstorms complementing  cannon fire. It all looks great. Ship designs are very nice too, but I don't know♥♥♥♥♥♥about ships.- The game inherently lends itself to friendly team-play. This not like casual DoTA or pub Counter-strike, where one man can carry a team. If the crew is not in sync, you will not win against a competent opponent. You work together, or you lose.- Music and Sound. The music is fitting and a thrill to listen to during the heat of sea warfare. Sounds and voice acting also leaves little room for complaints. The British navy-men, in particular, sound hilarious. Though this may bother the more serious players.Cons- Character models and animations need work. Models(character) are ugly, in my opinion. And there are still many animations missing for certain tasks, e.g. using the pump, loading a cannon, steering the ship, and so on.- As of right now, there is no ranking system, so there are really no stakes to winning or losing. But I am sure this will be changed in the future.- Melee. The melee system is mindless. You board the enemy ship and awkwardly swing at anything that moves; that sums up the melee system. Awkward animations and no depth. Though this is easy to forgive as the game is in early access and melee combat is not central to the game.Conclusion: A gem among the early access titles. And even with it's early access hindrances, it still feels like a bargain. It is THAT fun. A game where team synergy, and competently executed orders is key; BLACKWAKE is the epitome of team oriented gameplay.8//10 enjoyment value7.4/10 technical score"

You feel like you're a part of a whole working together to defeat the enemy regardless of whether you're repairing/firing/reloading.

I personally prefer 1v1 Hoy (I prefer a duel-esque 1v1 setting and I find Galleons to require too large of a crew to be able to function efficiently in a casual setting) and I enjoy playing as the Captain. And no, it's not for the reason a lot of players pick Captain, (""ZOMG IM THW CAPTEN IM IN CHARGE NOU"" they say as they don't even try to steer the ship, don't say a word to their crew and forget they're the captain halfway through the game.) but because I feel I can efficiently command a good crew. While a mic is, of course, recommended, a Captain can still lead a team to victory with just the ingame voice commands. And the pleasure you get from leading a good crew to victory as they follow your orders is unparraleled.Even so, the joy of the game doesn't just come from playing Captain. Even as a simple crewman, the game is still amazing. As long as your Captain is competent and knows how to give orders, coordinating with them is extremely satisfying. You know you have a good crew when you tell them your plans and you can see them react accordingly. ""I'm pulling away for repairs!"" You say as all their crew immediately leave their spots on the cannons and get to work fixing the ship. ""Turning around to Port!"" And just like that, the crew dismounts their starboard cannons and, like a magestic line wave of bearded sailor men, they swing over to the Port cannons and ready themselves.You might have guessed by now that this game is very reliant on a good team. And yes, that's very true. While it's an amazing experience, it does demand that your crew be competent, and a bad crewman who doesn't listen to orders can easily ruin the fun. But fear not, for the majority of the Blackwake community is competent and eager to help you and every else on your little Canoe paddle their way to victory. I'm not a perfect Captain, I've lost a good amount of times from my own faults, and sometimes when I do, my Crew are quick to suggest strategies and ways of doing things easier, and I'm happy to listen. And when you do sail into victory after a long-fought battle of coordination, the humble feeling of your crew all voting for you as Captain the next round is probably one of the most satisfying things in the game.Also, the soundtrack. Lord, the soundtrack. After my first game, I immediately went to search it up so I could listen to it again. I would have bought it on steam if I had any spare money.So yeah. Buy Blackwake. Just don't be toxic and ruin the game for everyone else, please."

,Recommended,420290,30500024,Posted: 13 March,all,Long John Silver,"I can't say the game is perfect, because nothing is, but this game comes as close to it as I could imagine. I remember seeing it during it's Kickstarter days and thinking how amazing it would be, but was worried the devs would be of the variety most Early Access projects come from. Make an incomplete game, stack the player's cash, and then go sit on a beach somewhere instead of improving their game. Not these guys though. They took the time to put a hold on another game mode addition to improve upon the existing content. They will not be charging for DLC, it will come as free content updates for all players. There will be no pay-to-win items purchaseable in-game. On top of all of this, they've remained dedicated to this project and it's players from the start.As far as the gameplay goes, it is solid, smooth, and satisfying. I never thought I would enjoy watching an animation of a musket reloading, but this game accomplished that. The chaos creates a visceral atmosphere that quenches your virtual bloodlust. Firing a cannon shot that takes out half the enemy ship's crew, ramming a dying ship to finish it off, or grappling the enemy to board and execute in a first-person close quarters battle aboard the enemy ship. All the while members of your ship's crew will be expected to repair any damage sustained, and pump out any water you've taken on. You may even have to occassionally throw a few buckets of water on a fire that breaks out. It's non-stop, hectic, team-driven chaos... and it's amazing. You will find yourself amazed at the skill of some of the captains you encounter.The community isn't great, but it's good. Most people you will come across during a match are helpful, attempt to complete the objectives of the game, and are generally easy going(Pirate banter is frequently a part of crew or faction chat). Then there are some, just as in any game, that are disruptive, immature, or generally unskilled in any capacity. They in no way diminish the overall value of this game however, so I cannot even list this as a con. The only thing about the current system I would like to see a change in is the inability to join a server, faction, or ship with friends. You pretty much have to time a simultaneous mass joining, and then hope there's enough slots on the same faction, and at least one of the ships, for you all to join. I would hope the dead horse beating about Early Access Alpha's not being a complete version of the game will allow most to excuse things like this. Either way, the hardest part of public games is finding a server with open slots... they stay full almost around the clock.To sum up this lengthy review(I'm so sorry for those of you who made it here), this game is worth whatever price they charge for it. It's fun, exciting, and even competitive. I genuinely have not had this much fun on a game in a long time. Please show your support for it and join in on the fun. See you on the High Seas(or at the bottom of them)!"

This game is fantastic! Don't get me wrong, it needs a lot more actual content. Right now there is only one very generic game mode and 2 ships (one small, one big) but the gameplay itself is what makes the game so fun. As a bonus the maps and weather are very diverse and would be acceptable in most finished games. Ships have good graphics/textures but the general environment does not.The concept is a blast. Working together with random people on a wooden ship to keep it afloat as things blow up around you and bodies launch 100ft into the air while the idiot captain you voted for spends the whole game yodeling. If you get bored of loading cannons, pumping water, and drinking rum, you can play as the captain, which adds a whole different layer of strategy and skill to the game. Captains are forced to use diverse tactics since no techique is ""the best"". Some ships constantly ram, some snipe, some are raiders, some bombard and then ram, and some ships are perpetually underwater because the captain sucks. An easy UI/""captain's command wheel"" and chatbox makes being a captain easy if you don't have a microphone. The game has a leveling system but this only improves your characters appearance, which is great because the costumes are worth collecting so I look forward to leveling up AND leveling up doesn't give people an unfair advantage. All you have is your skill and teammates to win the day.NOTE: I HAVE TRIED MULTIPLE HEADSETS ON ALL SETTINGS FOR THIS GAME AND NONE WORK (THIS GAME ONLY). OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AND I SENT IN A SUPPORT TICKET. However, the game is so fun and the captain wheel/chatbox so easy that I can still get elected to be captain and do a good job without a working headset.I also like the plug and play for Xbox 360 controllers, makes life that much easier.All in all as long as they continue to actually develop the game and release it as a full game someday, I give it 8/10 (-1 for my headsets not working)."

,Recommended,420290,32710923,Posted: 23 June,all,FlamesofDeceit,"I was sold on that first video for the game. Even though I only have 3.5 hours of play as of typing this review, I can tell you that this is my 2nd most played game in my steam library. There's some cool pirate battle games that are coming out soon, but as of right now, this is the one you want. For a game that just got released within the past few months, the graphics are gorgeous. Nice water effects and I love how technical the weapon reloads are. It really requires teamwork. I've been in lobbies where the captain takes his job seriously and ones without, and it really makes a different. You can use default button presses or speak through the mic. On max settings I get about 100 fps. Love it. Menu music is dope. You can die at any moment, very thrilling.Every pirate game reminds me of Pirates of the Caribbean. Not a bad thing. It's awesome.Things that need work: You don't really get hit markers when shooting or slicing other players, so it's difficult to tell if you're hitting them at all, which ends up being that you're running around spamming LMB. Sound mixing needs work, sometimes it drops out, but, it is alpha. Little tweaks here and there, but i'm sure the devs are aware of them.Overall, I would absolutely recommend this game. Lots of active servers. Maybe introduce sharks?"

Captain Jack Sparrow takes control of the ship - ""SS Cumcauce"" with no crew he takes down a whole ship by ramming it in the rear while it is distracted.But seriously this game offers amazing gameplay, humouric deaths and bootleg pirates. Play as a captain or a crew member you will still have an amazing time on the ship. The naval battles are excelent and show that even one random shot can just kill you from a cannonball. The soundtrack is also nice and fitting. The gameplay mechanics are well done and solid.The only con for this game is that the combat mechanics are a bit wonky and needs a bit more optimization.A solid 8.5/10"

U should be able to shoot or mabey even throw grapples into the sail and swing from one ship to other or be able to capture prisoners from other teams like a PIRATE!! Mabey even a 2v2 match with no respawns and u have to sail to land to dig up and take the treasure b4 the other team and sail away. And Where is the debris from the boat? it just magically disappears into thin air? in other words it should still be in the ocean and u should be able to float on it to prevent drowning."

I can tell that the future of this game will be good as it is already fun but i know it will get better.The game contains a variety of ships and 2 classes for the crew members:- The Captain, he steers the ship and gives orders like telling the crew to repair the ship, re-arm cannons etc.  He is also elected by the Crewmembers- The Crewmembers, they shoot and re-arm cannons, repair holes in the ship and the sails and also commandier swivel guns etc.  You will automatically be selected as a Crewmember if you didn't sign up and get elected to be the Captain.However the game is not worth £14.99 CURRENTLY.  In future updates the game will be worth more than this depending on wether the developers keep on making the game better.I have played a few hours of this game and by far the top 3 things to do in the game is:1.  Boarding ships2.  Shooting enemy crewmembers with muskets, pistols etc. because they feel and sound powerful3.  Shooting other ships with a volley of cannons that you just re-armedI'm not doing an extended review like i do with other games because there's really not that much to say due to the game being fun but fairly simple (but i'm sure it was pretty hard to make).In conclusion you should buy this game but if you don't like it, don't play it for more than 2 hours and don't own it for more than 2 weeks so that you can get a full refund of £14.99 for you to spend on a different game."
76561197973373512,Recommended,420290,30257877,Posted: 1 March,all,VicNuggets,"Overall my experience has been very positive. For being Early Access the game is awesome. It feels amazing when you're on a ship with an awesome crew and a solid captain. The downside to that is it's equally as annoying when you're on a ship with a bunch of dumb teenagers who don't even want to play the game.Games are very skill based and very team oriented. If you have thin skin and are easily offended by ships with ""colorful"" names, you might want to steer clear."
,Recommended,420290,30255069,Posted: 28 February,all,OwO,"Picture this:You and 6 others are manning a small sloop. Wind whips through the sails, it's raining and you can barely see. In the distance, cannons ring out and you can see ship lights through the fog. Through the wind you hear your captain yell out, ""Galleon incoming! Portside cannons ready!"" You and your crewmates run to the cannons and ready your lighters. The galleon appears through the rain and fog, suddenly. She comes up alongside your tub, anti sail cannons firing upon your ship. ""Fire!"" the captain calls out. You all touch your fuses with the lighters, one after another. Boom, boom, boom, boom. Grapeshot fires from your ship and explodes into the side of the galleon. Bits of wood fly, intermingled with arms and legs. You look to your right and your friend has exploded into a fine red mist from an enemy cannonball. As the smoke from the cannon clears, you realize your ship has taken on damage as well. The captain calls to repair, and the 5 of you who remain rush to patch the holes. You're taking on water, and you rush to man the pump. Your ship, now upright, begins to turn portside to take another pass. You all begin loading the cannons, ready to do some more damage. The galleon however, is already upon you. You're not ready, and their cannons ring out. 6 holes, 7 holes, 8 holes in your ship. You all once again attempt to repair your boat. Even the captain has left his post to patch the holes. But it's too late, you've already taken on too much water.""The Cuck Bucket has sunk"" the text reads out as you and your beloved ship slip into the black, briny deep.Honestly there's no reason not to get this game. I can't think of a single con, aside from a few bugs. And even then, those bugs are incredibly minor. This is quickly becoming my favorite game and I can't recommend it enough."

I faced nearly zero hiccups throughout the sessions i have played, and other than some clipping issues or strange control decisions, seems to  be fairly well optimised.I would definitely recommend playing this game with a group of 2 or 3 friends to get the full experience. The inclusion of Voice chat in the game does help y ou communicate with other players, but nothing beats the experience of swashbuckling your way into the hull of a nearby navy ship whilst you try and shoot your friends in the head with a pistol.Get this game, play this game, enjoy this game, wait for more updates for this game."

Also its not just about ranking up in level etc. Its also totally about strategy an mastering your own way of playing the game, you can be that repair guy constantly, making sure you are afloat by fixing holes, or take the pumps an pumping the water out of ship you take on, or climbing the ropes high above the sea to repair your sails.Or you can be always reloading the cannons keeping em stocked an ready to fire, Blasting away at the enemy.Or Storming onto the enemy ship for close combat with musket, pistol, an sword for hack n slash the enemy to death.Cut the yellow out of the yellow belly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s on the enemy team.OR BE THE CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP AN SAIL AN ORDER COMMANDS, FIRE PORT SIDE , FIRE STARBoard side.So many commands, so many strategys to use, Ramming, chasing, broadsiding,If you havent got the picture yet, its that this game is simply a blast that wil not get boring even once you max level your player on either pirate or british side.

Graphics and sound are well developed and gameplay is simple to grasp. (I recommend watching some YouTube vids before jumping into a game so you get the basic concepts of loading cannons, repairing the hull  and firing reasonably accurate from the start - otherwise you will likely face the wrath from more experienced crews/captains,So is it worth buying now in early access?At €20,  i think its just at its correct price point for early access.Hopefully more is added to keep it as fun and entertaing as 25 hrs or so i have played..While the sea battles are a blast, it does get repetitive after a few hours and more depth is needed to keep it interesting.Blackwake has bags of potential to make it a God-tier game (As it stands its a damn fun game)Team Death match is where it's at for most,  sea battles can be a rush when you have a solid crew and captain and are sinking ships and cups of tea simultaneously...Treasure trade mode involves a capture the flag style game, but frankly it needs more depth at this stage. It would be interesting to add a Co-op PvE  mode or even  single player mode for when you have enough of listening to cringy grown man pirate role play...Pros:Fun and immersive gameplayPirates and ships are fricken coolMajority of the community are top seadogsTakes the absolute pisssh out of the Brits! Characterisations and accents will put a grin on your face!Cons:A little repetitive after a few hours of gameplay - needs more depth on some game play modesBeing early access, it can suffer from some bugs and being unpolished in parts (No ball breaking bugs so far ime)Like all online games, some will take it too seriously, while others will scream BS down the mic while friendly firing etc etc  (Usually hopping servers will free you from that sort of tarded behaviour....Of course, this is no fault of the devs, but rather humanities failure to expedite (manipulate?) Darwins theory and remove all buzzkills from society).On that note I shall end by saying "" buy the game and dont be a buzzkill"" .

I would rather the chaos of risk of being ""offended"" than have speech and thoughts impeded. Especially this day and age. Kudos for that.Cons: Newbs can be a liability and get you all killed.Newbs insiting of being on the top deck cannons of galleons are irritating; Many don't realize there are more skill points to be had in the lower deck, and top deck needs experienced players that know when to jump on sails, when to go to bow anti-sail, when to repair and when to use cannons.Getting them to listen to experience is the biggest Achilles heel of this game, but no fault of the developer.Overall: Awesome game with so much potential for development!"

Also, goddamnit scrubs who come to my cannon I am manning, messing my reload-fire cycle making me waste resources even though theres HOLES IN THE SHIP OR ANOTHER CANNONS NEXT TO ONE I AM MANNING THAT NOBODYS MANNING ARGH!For now I will recommend this game, though I might change that depending on how devs will manage Early Access of this game.I think this game needs way more ship customization and overall different kinds of hulls like in Guns of Icarus. Also, different maps with different landmarks would be nice (I honestly dont care if they go bit fantasy with this game, something like Pirates of the Carribbean, as long as its cool)."

Dev's are active in their DISCORD server and on other platforms for feedback/bug reporting.Some issues:-  Don't join a server if its nearly full.  If someone beat you to the slot, it will still load for awhile and eventually kick you back to menu.-  More servers are coming online.-  Stability is generally good.  A few lag spikes/frame rate drops, but not bad.  Game generally bounces back quick.  If not, you can wait it out or leave and come back and it's fine.-  User interface is a bit on for the server browser.  Single clicking on a server will load it.  Scrolling in the broswer is via buttons towards the bottom of browser.-  You still have your movement WASD keys, don't let the controls picture confuse you.This is quite a great game for ALPHA state.  Devs are dedicated!  I recommend finding a group to regularly play with if you want to get really good."

Blackwake is definitely a unique game in itself that depends so heavily on efficient teamwork, rather than individual performance. You're only as good as your ship captain, and your ship captain is only as good as his crew. There are a few concerns though.1)	You can only do so much when you’re confined to the dimensions of your boat 90% of the time. There are not many things you can do, but basically how well you can do those things about sums up this game. There are new gamemodes on the way, so this could change.2)	As expected, there are quite a few bugs like un-fireable cannons and FPS drops. The developers are aware and seem very responsive so no doubt they’ll get this fixed. Just something to keep in mind if you decide to buy this as an early release version."

Good job Frankie.(insert Thumbs up)Secondly, I have played only a few games like this.. I guess one of the most recent ones I bought into would be the other early access Naval title, ""NAVAL ACTION"". IF any of you have played Naval Action then you know that it is pretty sophisticated in terms of travel, and even ship function. Great game for what it is.Now on to Blackwake. If you have ever wanted to play the CSGO of the Seas, look no furthur! Games can vary in sizes, I personally prefer the 2v2.. 2 Pirate ships vs. 2 British Navy Ships, and about 54 people split up between the 4 to keep them running. Voip is a big part of this game, as the Captain will yell at you non stop w/o taking a breath for 15 minutes straight until you sink to a plunder. You will also die... a lot. You will also learn the importance of knowing your tool hotkeys, as your ship will be sinking 80% of the time you're aboard.This game is a great strategy building/team building game. All the while it does not compromise the great fun you should be having while playing a game. Yes it is Alpha, Yes it does have a few bugs/glitches/ a little lag to deal with, but that's what I bought this game for..ARGGHH how I love me laggin booty.-PS. To the guys whining last night that I was the worst Captain in the history of the game because we got rekt... It still hurts you voted me off the ship..

It's not so realistic that it takes the fun out of it--  but also realistic to fit the time period.  Balancing is pretty good.  And I could honestly play this over and over hours on end.The only reason why I'd think you wouldn't like this game is because your anti-social or lack any team cooperation skills.  Maybe your rig sucks,  your pings high,  or you lack any friends. It's early access so,  whatever you thought was bad.  It's bound to get better.

We then spent the next 8 hours non stop on a 2v2 Gally server where the tom ♥♥♥♥ery was unleashed and resulted in some spectacular piracy against the British.I would pay a hell of alot more than £13.50 for this game. This game is definitly worth £25/30 alone. Bring on more game modes or more ships. Maybe few more options for group vs group modes and it can't be beaten.PRO's: Run's smoothly and will give you hours of non stop fun along with making some life long friends on the high seas.CON's: Server list crashed once last night and took roughly 5 minutes before they came back online for me. (<< Petty but honestly the only fault i've found in the last 8 hours of non stop playing)10/10+10 = BUY THIS DAMN GAME! You will not be disappointed.

,Recommended,420290,30149073,Posted: 24 February,all,KiltInAction,"Noting that I've only played through 3 games so far, Blackwake is a solid game.It bears a lot of resemblance to Guns of Icarus.As a crew member, you will be in charge of repairing holes, sails, and pumping water out of the ship, as well as loading and firing the guns. If your captain decides to ram and board an enemy ship, you rely on your primary and secondary firearms and your trusty blade to repel attackers and kill the enemy crew.As a captain, you direct the crew's efforts using VoIP and keybound commands, as well as steer the ship to victory.Currently, the only issue I have is the relatively small number of servers, wich tend to be full, but I bet that will be resolved in the near future.There is also some degree of customisation of your character, including presets for the face, beard, hair, outfit, hat and face paint.Overall, a solid game, especially for an Early Access title."

It somehow was able to take whatever genre Guns of Icarus is and improve on it exponentially. Perhaps its the added boarding combat and ability to take pot shots at the other crew with your musket. Perhaps its the suprisingly good gameplay/combat balance in an early access. It can be a little choppy at times but no more so than any other half decent early access release. The future looks bright for this game so go ahead and buy it if you were on the fence. You won't be disappointed. Well worth the modest price they are asking even this early in release. Arrrgh! See you on the open seas!

,Recommended,420290,30152038,Posted: 24 February,all,[1RW] Z. Pearce/GeekSqueak,"A pretty good game! I enjoyed it thoroughly, considering the early state it is released in. It does have pretty high specifications, but the game played smoothly and was very stable. Considering the demanding multiplayer environment, it was exceptionally stable, and combined with the graphics ran with the sort of optimisation I'd expect to see from AAA+ titles. It was quite CPU and GPU heavy, so if your system has problems with overheating you may want to resolve that issue before proceeding. I can't really comment on network optimisation as I have very fast internet, but there were no complaints from my friends, some of whom have frankly martian internet.I felt that a higher degree of historical accuracy would'v been desirable, but the animations were pretty good and the muskets didn't feel like slightly smoky assault rifles (always a bonus!). Sterling work from the animation team. Ships had a good degree of functionality.Some issues:No premade teammaking. This makes playing with friends quite hard, especially as servers fill quickly. If you have a few friends and you want to play on the same ship, this becomes quite difficult quite quickly. A major issue I hope will be resolved.Poor character customisation. They've said they're planning to improve on this. I hope to see greater detail in this area shortly.No private servers. They've said they'll release server files, but the ability to create private custom games within the client would be great. Again, this only really affects you if you want to play with teammates. Team integration runs pretty poorly at the moment, which is a shame.Matches end too quickly, as ships move too fast. Again, a minor issue, and probably highly subjective. When ships move so fast, it's hard to embrace the tactical side of the battles.Altogether, a very good game with incredibly promising community prospects and even more promising multiplayer potential. It is clear this is a work of personal passion and pride. Highly recommend!"

,Recommended,420290,30150773,Posted: 24 February,all,Azreken,"First off, this is early alpha, so take anything that I say with that in mind.Pros:-Mechanics are solid. Loading cannons takes time and effort, but feels overall rewarding when you light it and it blasts a hole in the enemy ship.-VOIP is very good for communicating in proximity, within your ship, or within your faction. In my experience if you have a captain with VOIP everyone seems to listen to him. It's especially fun when you have a captain super into RP and everyone goes along. Really feels like you're part of a crew.-Muskets feel like muskets, and that's a good thing.Cons:-Some FPS issues as reported by others, but it does seem like the devs are aware and actively working on a solution.-Glitchy ship boarding sometimes, but overall fun.-Swordplay seems sluggish and can use some work, but overall works ok.-Level system does not seem to be working. I can get up to level 3-4 in one game, and then when I go back to the menu I'm level 1 again. Doesn't really detract from the fun of the game though.OVERALL:For $20, this game is a steal. Great dev team it seems like, and fairly decent community right now. Every server was full when I was playing, and I had a blast for almost 3 hours before taking a break on my first time playing."

In my opinion."

The game is just funny and doesn't take itself too serious and is fun to play.The game mechanics are nice. The idea that each crew member almost has a role, and everything has to be done manually forces teamwork.The graphics look rather nice, and there is a lot of enviroments and weather.The customization seems promising, you can change the colour of your ship and I'm sure this area will be expanded.ConsThe game is good, but its repetitive and I feel like there needs to be more content to keep this game alive, hopefully that will come.FPS Drops and other minor performance issues.The game doesn't seem to know where to place itself, some areas of the game feel very realistic and others are cartoonish and sort of ridicilous.Overall:I'd reccomend picking this up! Its fun even in its current state."

Now the part you have been waiting for... the combat ! the cannons are nothing short of fun and exciting to shoot. The pistols and muskets are effective and slow to reload which is good however the sword combat isnt the best but should be improven withing time. after surviving an incomming volley of cannon balls your ship will get holes and start to sink even cause fire to spread. and let me tell ya it is the funnest thing trying to bring afloat your ship whilst its half under. there is player customisation  with a leveling up mechanic, the higher level you are the better clothing you unlock and with constant updates and promise of more content yarrrrrhhhh! dat be de one 4 me! 10/10 so get your rum and peg leg and sink them ships!!"

The gameplay is involved and with the right Captain and crew, you really feel like a living piece of the ship. The long reload times for an individual's guns prevent person to person combat from overshadowing the glorious ship-to-ship combat they've created. Once melee combat is refined, it will add another layer of awesome by making ship boarding more viable in battles.There is still much to be improved on but the core idea is executed well and will only get better with further development."

The game mechanics work well, there is some room for improvement but it is definitely playable.If you have a good Captain who has a microphone and knows how to make good calls, but can also listen when members of the crew give suggestions, you become unsinkable. On the other hand, if your Captain sucks or is to overbearing, it makes you want to defect. Basically, this is a game that relies on communication.5/5 from me."

I have had matches where I was the top scorer on my team and I never made a move offensivly. Running supplies, manning the pumps, patching holes in the hull, feeding people rum or tea when they are injured, climbing the ropes and repairing the sails.The game has some performance issues, but I have not found them to be gamebreaking, and the devs have aknowledged them and are currently trying to fix them.Overall, I reccommend this title and have been having a whole lot of fun with it."

,Recommended,420290,30220026,Posted: 27 February,all,Potato McGruff,"Wow, for an Early Access game this is quite good and one of the few Early Access games I haven't felt ""burnt"" by.The Naval Battles are really satisfying and the game is heavy based on Teamwork. You will need to repair, resupply, load cannons, time firings with the ships movement, dodge cannonballs, not dodge cannonballs, musket people, stab people with broken bottles, drink tea, pump water off the ship, try not to catch on fire, swim, and blow up the other ships.Working together as a crew and as a fleet is a great feeling when everyone does it. You will vote your captain in at the start of a round (and if they suck you can mutiny against them). A good captain certainly makes a difference with guiding the ship and barking out commands.The game /is/ early access though. I've not experienced any game breaking bugs, but I have seen some hilarious rag doll bugs as people go FLYING from cannonball hits or bodies stick weirdly into the ship. My friend did ""fall"" into the ship and get stuck once. He suicided and we moved on. Graphics look good, although AMD users may experience an issue with ""Christmas lights"" in the water as the Devs described it, but they offer a workaround.There are more gameplay modes coming as well according to the Devs.You also level up and get a top hat. If you're the captain, you can color the ship neon pink and name it childish things.I do recommend this is you're looking for a fun Naval Battle style game. There's nothing else out there like this that I know of and it's a blast."

No disconnections, no lag, everything seems to work decently well. Even the controls are super easy to learn. My only negatives is towards players in specific:This game is awesome if you can get at least three friends to play with you.Maybe you will find some randoms who are cool and actually work as a team too, but playing this alone loaded with randoms is very bad. It reminds me of Call of Duty days where communication is non-existant. You are talking to a wall most of the time.Find yourself a group of people you can rely on and have fun out there.

ORRRR be in the navy and re-live the accurate life of a tea drinking seaman... all bloody good fun if you ask me.The game is beutifull graphiclly however texture modules on the characters themselves is pretty poor and the customization is lacking. Not that this will stop me playing. Gameplay is very magical, Communication is key and i love hearing trying to role play as a captain. its enough to make anyone cringe but laugh at the same time.Fairly priced however would like to see more content in the future. As at the moment you can get a few outfits and hats from leveling up. But in the early stages of this game i would say game play is more important which in this game it certainly is.Really enjoy blowing people up the the clouds when hit with a cannon ball.. this still makes me chuckle in game.The black screen of doom when youve been shot in the head is brilliant as.PROS- Gameplay. Really fun and enjoyable.- Communication on mic throughout the teams.- Fellow friendly players.- Graphics are reasonably good despite the odd glitch which i beleive is now fixed.- YOU GET TO BE A PIRATE,- Some very intence battles at times.CONS- Would like to see a party play option or clan/crew option- More customization objects.- More content in the form of game modes, Maps and weapons.- maybe a ranking system in the future... I know servers some what have there own but yeah.. you know what i mean.Other than that buy this game ull have hours on hours off fun... Ive not stopped playing... Litrally and i have to go to work."

,Recommended,420290,30154199,Posted: 24 February,all,deSelby,"First impressions review:I've played only a few matches, but I enjoyed every one of them.Of course, this game looks and plays as an early access game. There is still a lot of work to be done, but if properly polished and well maintained (as all mp titles should) it can be one of the best mp games.Pros:- Interesting concept with a great potential- Well maintained balance between complexity of mechanics and dynamism (I think CS GO is a paragon in that sense);Basic moves and actions are fairly simple to understand, but skill is required to be good, especially if you are a captain.Both mechanical and tactical skills are needed - one should be aware of the situation, communicate and be a good team player and a fighter.-Nice loudout system. There are no classes of anything like that, you just pick a weapon that would fit your style better ( in general - lighter or a heavier) and then you do what you have to do, or what your captain tells you to do.- And yes, there are ranged and melee weapons. Currently there are 3 or 4  types of each, if I'm not mistaken. You have your rifle,  your pistol and a melee weapon.You wouldn’t necessarily have to use them in a match, you can spend the whole time running around shooting and reloading cannons or fixing the sails, but deck fights are also fun when they happen.How often they happen largely depends on the situation and playstyle.- Fun character design and voiceover- You can customize your char. Hopefully we will see more fabulous beard designs)  And yeah, bring in the parrots!- So far community looks good, captains are smart and supportive of their crew ))NB: Can’t comment on graphics as my rig is far from optimal and I don’t pay attention to visuals. To me they are ok.Cons:- Early access and all that goes with it  - some bugs here and there, some optimization issues.- Deck fights need some polish first I think, they are fun but little bit hectic and sometimes buggy- Server history would be niceBug report button and social media links are nicely put in the main menu. I personally got the impression that devs are good about community involvement and are interested in making their product better.Let's pray it won't be one of those projects that is stuck in the early access limbo.P.S.Sorry for my grammar, English is my second language."

In its current state there are a few different game modes throughout the server list and some decent character customization / leveling. The gameplay is incredibly fun although each game is same same but different; basically it is comparable to something like CS:GO, Chivalry, etc. where each game is the same concept but will play out differently each time. The graphics are pretty good especially the lighting and weather effects. Running this game on a GTX 970 in 1080p maxed out I get around 90-120 fps although I prefer to play with V-Sync on. I do get frame drops that can go to around something like 30fps for a second but it doesn't happen often enough to break the gameplay / immersion. Seeing as this game just came out a few days ago I see it only getting better from now."

,Recommended,420290,30178920,Posted: 25 February,all,Dan Pretzelman,"It's not often that I encounter a game for which criticism is hard to make, but Blackwake is one of those games.All of the future potential of this game is in just that; potential. Unlike many other releases for which the first months are a slow grind of fixing release issues and balance problems, Blackwake has seemingly released in a state for which, a few minor bugfixes aside, the concerns of a thoughtful player are only with where the game can go from here.Pros:-The first thing anyone who plays it notices, even with a mediocre rig like myself, is just how appealing the game looks. Excelent water meshes and particle effects, combined with some of the best weather I've seen in a game combine to produce a very atmospheric experience-Balanced gameplay is hard to achieve on release, but the symmetry of the Pirate and Navy factions and lack of Pay to Win mechanics or any weapon unlocks at all for that matter means only player skill and crew coherency matters to achieve victory.-Prospects for future expansion of the game are numerous; everything from new maps, new ships, new weapons, new gamemodes, to the prospect of giant sea monsters.-Its fun as ♥♥♥♥, really.Cons:-Like with any team based game you are reliant on your crew posessing a modicum of brain cells and skills, which is as we know not always guarenteed. The system for team selection is purely voluntary beyond a basic numerical team balance. This means it's possible for teams of incompetants with good server connectivity to fill an entire team and leave the more skilled players to fill the other. There's something to the 'get gud' philosophy of gaming that means the lesser players will learn from these experiences what not to do, but at the same time it can be irritating when the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥patrol fills your team.-Performance at release is acceptable, but lag spikes and server lag are still common.

76561198308989114,Recommended,420290,30210445,Posted: 26 February,all,Richard,"After buying so many failed EA titles in the past, I was very hesitant to pick this one up. Eventually, I dove in and bought it to see what it's like for myself. At the time of writing this review, I have no regrets.I must say that graphic-wise, this game is not that bad. When you're in the crows nest of your ship looking over the horizon, the ocean/lightning looks amazing. Also, hitting an enemy with a cannonball and watching them fly 40 ft through the air also adds to the entertainment, so 10/10 for ragdoll physics.Performance-wise, the game is also good. I would have called it ""great"" if it weren't for the (subtle) drops in fps. With an MSI GTX 1070 and a i7 6700k @ 4.6ghz, I usually run between 110 - 150 fps on ultra, but those numbers fluctuate quite a bit. I have also yet to experience any significant ""gamebreaking"" glitches although I have heard reports of players getting stuck on cannons, stuck in loading screens, menu buttons not clickable, etc. But these are expected from an EA title & most likely will be fixed in the near future. 7/10Gameplay-wise, the game is FANTASTIC. It actually makes you feel like you're apart of the ship's crew. It's very exciting when you engage in an enemy ship, because you can choose to fire your cannons and slowly sink her, grapple and board, or even ram the side for that matter. From what I've seen, slowing the enemy down/injuring their boat followed by a grapple is the most effective method. When you grapple an enemy, it becomes a ""1 life elimination game"", causing the respawn time to increase to 100+ seconds. Your objective at this point is to kill all their crew before they kill yours, and you win. 10/10Extra Notes: One more thing I'd like to add is the voice acting done for the ""z"" ""x"" commands.

This is what an alpha should be, for developers to use for feedback from customers to improve the quality of the game.Gameplay wise, the game is unique in its own way, I see a lot of potential for future updates to make combat a bit more fluid, especially during melee.The atmosphere is amazing, some maps are snowy, stormy, or sunny, and the ambient sounds can really trigger some ASMRs if you are a nature lover like myself.Graphically, the game looks beautifully, and same can be said for how well it runs. I have an EVGA GTX 1070 and an i5 Intel Core 4690k.The mechanics revolve on team work more so than any other game I have ever played, and that includes CS:GO. The community seems to be inviting and very friendly. I see people help newcomers all the time. Every community has its share of toxic players, but I haven't encountered any so far. Elements of team work include voice communications with captain and crew, repairs, and coordination just to name a few. This game is impossible to play without working together with your team.Overall, for 19.99, this game is a must, and they aren't asking to much unlike many of the discarded alphas we have seen in the past. This game has my full support."

(With 2 variants each, Pirate and British)I have been following this game for about a year, and I am really excited that I finally get to play it.  Although it is a little rough around the edges in terms of general polish, I can forgive most of it because of the ridiculously small dev team.

Each game will be a totally different experience depending on your captain.  The one downside is the capatins that have no clue what they are doing. Reloading is slow which makes sence when using older guns. This game is highly realistsic. This game allows anything from ramming ships to fixing up your own. I for sure reccomend this game to anyone who wants $17 well spent! Get it while it's on sale!

The emphasis on teamwork is rediculously interwoven.A Captain can literally make or break a ship.I would say that this game is sort of a mix of arcade and simulation. Its got an almost team fortress esque look to it. But characters, movements, gameplay, and animations all feel more of a simulation. Its got impressive graphics and my GTX 1070 can only run its at 30-40 fps. Quite a demanding game to be honest, especially whith shadows and SSAO on high or enabled. Those are the 2 most impacting graphics settings it seems. So i stick to my 2K monitor for smooth 60 FPS.Boarding ships as they are going down as they desperatly try to repair their ship, while fighting off attackers is epic. Even though it may seem all is lost, its totally possible to turn battles around. It may look humerous and playful, but its actually quite gory and darker than its tone suggests."

,Recommended,420290,30291137,Posted: 3 March,all,Wolf,"Not kidding, this is the best naval action game published so far.I have discovered this game on Kickstarter a long time ago.All backers were invited to play the alpha, which I joined since the first day.I followed the game through it's development.Of course the alpha versions of the game were a bit buggy but the testers have pretty much gotten rid of every bug in the game.This is not a realistic game, the development was focussed on gameplay.When joining a server you can choose a team (if not unbalanced).Within that team you can choose a crew to be part of.Every crew votes a captain.The captain takes the wheel and controls the ship and sails.The rest of the crew has to do tasks like:Repairing the ship, using the hammer, fixing the holes in the ship.Hoaling supplies, going to the back of the ship to get a crate, bringing it towards the ammo boxes near the cannons.Reloading a cannon, put gunpowder in the cannon, put a round shot in there, ram it with the rod.Firing cannons, using the ignition stick, wait for the ship to line up and light the fuse.Repairing the sails, climbing the nets on the side, using the hammer to patch the holes in the sails.Shooting anti sail cannons, slowing down the enemy ship by aiming at it's sails.Shooting swivel guns, a gun with low penetration and a little difficult to aim but it makes one shot kills.Boarding, prepare your muskets, pistols and swords, as soon as the enemy ship is nearby or within swimming distance, board the ship and kill everyone repairing the ship.Currently the game offers 2 ships:The hoy, which is a smaller ship for about 7-9 players with 4 cannons on each side, the hoy turns quickly and sails fast.The galleon is the bigger ship that requires at least 7 players to have an advantage on a hoy, the ship has 8 cannons on each side (16 both sides), 2 bow chasers and 2 stern cannons. Being a little slower than the hoy, it can deal a lot of damage.The game has a few game modes:Hoy vs Hoy: 8 players fight 8 players on a hoy, deplete enemy reinforcements or sink the ship to win.Galleon vs Galleon: A 15 players fight 15 players on a galleon, deplete enemy reinforcements or sink the ship to win.2 Hoy vs 2 Hoy: 2 hoys with 8 players on each team, deplete enemy reinforcements or sink enough ships to win.2 Galleon vs 2 Galleon: 2 galleons with 13 players on each team, deplete enemy reinforcements or sink enough ships to win.Fleet: One galleon and two hoys vs one galleon and two hoys, deplete enemy reinforcements or sink enough ships to win.PROs- Completely debugged in closed alpha- Most stable early access release I've seen so far- Fun community- Skill based, no level advantages, only cosmetics- Game being updated regularly- Developers are actively responding to feedback from the community- Hilarious moments (example: see H2ODelirious on Youtube, Venalis_21 on Twitch)CONs- Not fun without headset- People might rage on the losing team- Not many ship models, these will be added in the future- No progression, only cosmetics have to be unlocked."

If you're boarding frequently, a musket is not a great choice. If you're firing from a distance, a musket is good. But yeah, people yell and have fun but it's also a lot of realistic fighting.

Play casually, smoke bongs and derp around on a galleon, or get way into it, captain a Hoy and master your ram, grapple, and board game.  Can't imagine someone not finding something to like about this game.  GET A MIC if you're going to buy this game.  Don't even bother if you don't have a mic.  You have to be able to scream sailor lingo into your headset.  It's intergral to the experience.Finally a good naval game where you really work together to crew a ship, and you aren't forced into roles by choosing a class or whatever.  You just jump in and figure out your priorities based on where you are on the ship.  But the game really shines in the close combat I feel like.  The devs are all apologetic about melee combat, but I actually thinks it's hella fun, lol.  Nothing is more satisfying than that white hit marker circle, that ragdoll, god, it's ♥♥♥♥ing great.  The long♥♥♥♥♥weapon reloads and how inaccurate a lot of the weapons are make scoring kills with them really really satisfying.  Capture the Booty, a mode with a center island, and thus a bigger focus on firearm and melee combat, is going to be a great.  Can't wait.Also try being the captain!  It's daunting, but the learning curve isn't THAT steep.  Ask your crew for help lining up the cannons.  The game needs some more even merely competant captains.  Getting good at navigating around the galleons broadsides, getting your crew together and getting off tight, quick shots as you turn past an enemy, damn, it's good.  Very fun.Small dev team, so content updates are slow, but new game mode should *actually* be in soon, and it looks like it's going to be a lot of fun."

No regrets! Blackwake has the perfect balance of humor and drama. One moment you're being pounded with cannons and sinking like a stone, hammering and pumping away for dear life, the next you're running around deck sipping tea with pinkies up shouting insults in a hilariously nasal british voice. Teamwork is essential to survival, but it's done in such a way that you don't feel pressured to work as a team: it comes naturally and enjoyably, and you are richly rewarded for being helpful. By far one of the best multiplayer games of this year, and certainly one of the best I've ever played.

People are generally very kind and not toxic. The on game mechanics are medioca. I would say that on the ship everything feels nice and smooth, however when you are raiding another boat, the mechanics feel very over the top and not grounded. This doesn't matter to much because most of your time will be spent on the boat.Please listen to the captain as he is usually experienced and knows what he is doing. Don't nominate yourself as a captain if you don't know what to do. Don't fire your gun at long range, it's useless. If you are given a job, let's say repairing the sails. Always make repairing the sails your priority. Don't go off and do anything else. It is amazing how one guy screwing up can destroy your ship."

Directors of the series include Gore Verbinski (1–3), Rob Marshall (4), and Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg (5). The series was most notably written by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (1–4); other writers include Stuart Beattie (1), Jay Wolpert (1), and Jeff Nathanson (5). The stories followed the adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). Characters such as Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and Joshamee Gibbs (Kevin McNally) follow Jack, Will, and Elizabeth in the course of the films. The fourth film featured Philip Swift (Sam Claflin) and Syrena (Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey), while the fifth film will feature Henry (Brenton Thwaites) and Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario). The films take place in a fictional historical setting; a world ruled by the British Empire, the East India Company and the Spanish Empire, with pirates representing freedom from the ruling powers.The film series started with their first release on the big screen in 2003 with Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, which received positive reviews from the critics and grossed US$654 million worldwide. After the first film's success, Walt Disney Pictures revealed that a trilogy was in the works. The franchise's second film, subtitled Dead Man's Chest, was released three years later in 2006; the sequel proved successful, breaking financial records worldwide the day of its premiere. Dead Man's Chest ended up being the number one film of the year upon earning almost $1.1 billion to-date at the worldwide box office. The third film in the series, subtitled At World's End, followed in 2007, and Disney released a fourth film, subtitled On Stranger Tides, in 2011 in conventional 2D, Digital 3-D and IMAX 3D. On Stranger Tides succeeded in also grossing more than $1 billion, becoming the second film in the franchise and only the eighth film in history to achieve this.So far, the film franchise has grossed $3.73 billion worldwide; it is the eleventh highest-grossing film series of all-time and it was the first franchise where more than one film grossed $1 billion worldwide.A fifth film, subtitled Dead Men Tell No Tales, is set to be released on May 26, 2017."

The developers are active, pleasant, and this is a fine example of what an Early Access title actually should be.That being said it is pretty clunky, it has that Mount and Blade feel; so I am sure many people will love it but you will need to expect that going in. It's very stiff, and hard to tell what is just the way it's going to be, and what is just an EA issue that will be resovled down the road.There is also a LOT of downtime, especially during grapple boarding fights. Respawns can be as high as 120 seconds, everything reloads slow, and so on. It all makes sense, it's realistic, but presents you with a lot of just doing nothing.Melee is 100% useless but they said they are working on fixing that.Has some online server/browser issues, you need to join on people whenever possible.Nothing is more frustrating than being one second from respawn, and your ship is grappled and it shoots up to 119 seconds.Still, great game.As long as they eventually fix all the server and UI issues my review will stay positive; even if a lot of the other things remain as is it's still good."

Graphics are great for any standard, and the polish is already there. Devs are quick to help fix things. This game makes teamwork hilariously enjoyable and I really haven't encountered anyone whose made gameplay bad.Whats Bad?Server browser is a bit clunky, sometimes things don't work. Have crashed once, but was already leaving the game, no big deal. Movement isn't fluid, a bit rigid and clunky. Sword combat isn't very exciting, basically hit them before they hit you a couple times. Guns can sometimes not hit even when you're aiming right at them.

If you and your mates are looking for a game to play I would highly recommend picking this one up. For 20 bucks you get a hillarious gameplay experience. I'll give you an example, my ship was sinking and half the crew was dead on my ship. Our captain turned the ship towards the enemy galeon and we boarded the ship. With 4 pirates we sunk the galeon with a crew of 13.In conculsion, if you like the idea of pirates vs navy ship combat, muskets and flintlock pistols, sabers and knives and loading cannons while being chased by a galeon and at the same being boarded. You will have so much fun is this game."

Most big early access games don't come out this well put together and the devs are highly active.The game is played in first person while maning a ship. The game requires cooridination between the captain which is steering the ship and the crew which is reloading guns (with diffrent shot if needed), repairing holes or sails, pumping out water and putting out fires. One person cannot be a hero in this game. To succeed you need to have a well coordinated crew to support the captian and a smart captain to support the crew - BOTH are needed.This game also allows you to have a good old fashioned musket, blunderbuss, pistol and sword fights. When boarding or sailing along ship side the tension is felt as one musket shot is your death. (Respawns are present)I only see this game getting better with time with HUGE potential for esports.BUY THIS GAME IF:- You love naval warfare- Can give and recieve orders- Enjoy team games the rely on coordination- Want to watch somone turn into red dust when hit by a cannon ballDO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF:- You dont like taking orders- Want to be a singular hero in a match- Like automatic weapons- Dont like first person- Your not a team player"

,Recommended,420290,30285427,Posted: 2 March,all,King Crazy,"TL;DR: Wish Guns of Icarus lived up to its potential? Love pirates? Have a few friends willing to drop $20 on this? Buy it. Stop sitting on the fence. Just try not to take the game too seriously.---------------------------Let me preface this by saying that you'll want friends to play with. If you don't have a group of friends willing to drop $20 on this game, then you best hold off. That being said, it's certainly worth the money.Blackwake is everything I was hoping it would be. I was very skeptical due to it being early access, but the developers' constant communcation and frequent updates helped me to get over that fear. I've been a sucker for early access ""bait-n-switch,"" and I was very cautious... But my love for pirate games pushed me over the edge to get this (that, and Hat Films' livestream).Blackwake has a fantastic balance of intense and comedic moments. Cooperatively sailing a vessel is addicting, every match bringing about its own unique moments. One second you'll be loading up a cannon, and the next you'll find yourself treading water as the hull of your ship was breached right where you were standing.However, your enjoyment of the game will largely depend on the crew you're with (which is why playing with friends may be the best choice). Try to find some people who don't take the game TOO seriously, while still looking to succeed. Those will often be the best crews. Take this game with a grain of salt: it's not meant to be a hardcore, boat simulator. The game constantly reminds you of its goofy undertones every time someone next to you gets eviscerated into a pile of chunky bits by a stray cannonball.If you're on the fence, and love games like Guns of Icarus (and were disappointed by Guns of Icarus' arguably squandered potential), then you'll love this game. Just be sure to have a good group to play with, and don't be a salty sea-biscuit who takes everything too seriously."

A recent update seemed to have added some major bugs though, mainly dealing with connecting. Once you get in though, you're good to go.The actual ship combat (cannons and whatnot) is really fun, and really depends on how good your crew and captain communicate. Gun combat is also pretty good, but seems like it could use a bit of work. Swordplay is pretty bad in my opinion, but from my experience you can usually shoot them before they get a chance to use it.Very few bugs, which is great for an early access title. After dismounting from a cannon, I got my head stuck on the upper deck floor, but could get out. Nothing gamebreaking so far, and that only happened once.I would highly recommend as of right now.

Sometimes captains who have been kicked out would go aroumnd firing every single cannon. and the game is set to require a dozen people to  vote kick you in case ytou missbehave.As a captain, i had people sit on my steering wheel. so i wasnt able to see aroudn me much. in turn this caused me to be in the wrong place facing wrong side...etc.As i said at the beginning. it is a really good concept. it just has a lot of issues to be worth recommanding.would be nice to designate more ranks. and only captain and first mate can talk for instance during combat."

Enemy ship is sinking and all aboard are panicking to fix holes and pump out water. I jump out of my ship and swim 100 meters and sneak on board enemy ship. Proceed to shoot 2 people fixing holes and gut the guy pumping water before anyone knows what is happening. Such a fun game I highly recommend.

I love ramming people too so it works out.My usual game:Applies for captain with ""DO NOT PICK ME,"" I say I'm an awful captain and just ram people. I still have a 100% captain rating for whatever reason.Gets captain.I suck at aiming the ship, so I ram everything.Get best gunner with 30 hits and 100% accuracy because ramming counts as gun hits.Most kills, best gunner. 10/10 would captain and ram people again."

The community is great, they listen to each other and work as a team, all while talking in pirate voices. It's like you took a bunch of teenagers and put them up to the task of colonial naval combat. I love it.Melee system can use some work as of now, and some optimization fixes to reduce lag during heavy combat. Otherwise, the systems work very well."

When you have a good captain (which is very often) this game truly shows it colors. The teamplay involved and the pure fun and enjoyment that you recieve is amazing. Not only this, but the graphics are very beutiful and is very easy to run. I have found that this game is most fun without playing with friends and that half the fun is playing solo with people online. Sometimes when my friends are not online, I will boot up this game knowing that I will have a great time. I Highly recomned this game to anyone, wether you have friends who will play with you or not. On top of all that, the developers are nice and truly make games for other people. They regularly update the game, patch problems, and listen to feed back (posive or negative) This is shown b thier willingness to understand if you refund the game or not. All in all this game is Amazing and the pinocle of not only PC gaming but also Kickstar and other crowd funded websites."

,Recommended,420290,32258842,Posted: 7 June,all,GBG|SarcasticPotato,"First off I'll start by saying this is an AMAZING game. Well worth the $20 especially with what they plan on adding. The only problem I have with it is the team balancing. Now i understand the need for team balancing, but there has to be a better way so i can play with my friends and not relying on luck that we can play on the same team and even less the chance the same ship. Maybe look at the way COD or Guns of Icarus team balances."
,Recommended,420290,32687572,Posted: 23 June,all,The Lost Dog,"I Love this game.Played it with a group of 5 friends and mayhem ensued.Whilst playing it is important to remember you are nothing. You mean nothing. You are a mindless cog loading and firing, loading and firing. Your life is your captain's to spend. you could be doing the most diligent supply errand in the world and suddenly a cannon blast will knock you overboard as your ship rams the enemy resulting in the entire of each team screaming at the suddenly alone captains to slaughter each other.Its balmy, but a bloody good laugh with at least 100 hours of fun multiplayer gameplay and what seems to be a dedicated team behind it who care and work tirelessly.If you like Pirates, Teamplay, Strategy and being a grunt with a higher purpose known only to the capain - get this game."
