,Recommended,420520,34138467,Posted: 9 August,all,William Shakesman,"I just love how this game came about. A Japanese dude made an empire war game. Another guy loved it so much he made his own module for it that eventually became this, and he loved so much he worked with the original creator to get that thing released here. This is like some guy's fantasy setting Dynasty Warriors Empires CAW roster, complete with backstories for various kingdoms, gone professional! He lived the dream!As for the actual game, the DW Empires comparison is pretty apt. You have a fairly simple kingdom management game where a wide variety of factions, a full suite of the Japanese-take-on-Western fantasy setting characters, elves, imperials, knights, frog people, demons, each with unique hero units all voice acted by Japanese voice actors, are all locked in a map and jockeying to steal cities from each other. As near as I can tell, there is no tech tree, each turn you can just buy troops or invade, with a smidge of diplomacy bribes on the side. Battles are top down, real time, Total War style. Not a lot of strategy but you can try to micromanage your casters and archers if it makes you feel more tactical. The entire thing captures the immersion of working for a kingdom in DW Empires, as well as the repeatable war-gamey ness of it. Also taken from Empires is the ability to be a wandering general... but you literally have no options in this mode except to attempt to take on a neutral kingdom by yourself to rebuild a kingdom or sign on with another kingdom and get brought along on battles like another unit. It's not an addition worth considering, especially compared to what Rot3K and the Empires games offer in officer play.Simming of battles is available, as well as letting the CPU do your turns, or just watching the entire game play out under CPU control.To top it off, some of the factions (Hopefully all eventually, if the game gets a decent following to justify having it translated) have story segments to go along with the campaign. You can play any faction, but only a couple have their story events translated. They don't get in the way of the main war game though.For the art and setting alone, this is worth your 3bux easily. The gameplay itself is pretty simple, but the addictiveness of it gets obvious as you play it. And you might find yourself wishing you had some mod tools to make your own crazy kingdoms as you get into it. I recommend this for anyone who has enjoyed Dynasty Warriors Empires type games and want to see that same sensibility applied to a more Total War-esque framework.EDIT: As I've played more, I can see more of the strategy form. For the tactical battles, there are quite a few magic skills between the various units, but apart from the ""expend all your summons and blast/heal/buff"" I don't see that there is much need for strategy in the actual battles. Those good at the game might see what I don't.In the strategic map, the game resembles a massive mexican standoff. Units that have recruited or attacked cannot be march to support defense, and can only defend if directly attacked. This means that unless you can be sure you are leaving only one province open when you make a move (Nearly impossible), you have to balance your main squads and your reserve squads ready to back up the main force when you get counter-attacked. Letting the enemy bisect your kingdom means they can easily prevent your heroes from escaping, forcing them to return to wandering.Most kingdoms are between two or three mortal enemies, with a few more belligerents who cannot be bribed on far sides of the map, so gaining ground without immediately losing it is very hard. In this sense, it is not like Dynasty Warriors Empires where nothing can slow your march to unification except maybe a Lu Bu cheese combo.In addition, Troops themselves level up, over time a bit when not fighting, and more in a successful fight. Troop levels are your main source of power beyond bringing sheer numbers to bear. If you have a troop of a certain level threshold you can actually pay more to hire troops close to that level rather than get level 1 scrubs again.EDIT2: These campaigns are not quick things. Taking down your enemies is like nailing jello to a wall and it is a lot of work to try to crest the hill into dominance late game and then take down your opponents. I imagine for strategy gamers this is just fine but the length of these games to me makes it a little tougher to replay."

BUY IT!!!!How dose it play?Kind of reminds me of suikoden mixed with a 4x game with a bit of fireemblem mixed in.Pro's- Battles are huge- Alot of characters with really great art work- battles are voiced ( jp voices)- The game has some 4x elements but its pretty strightforward and easy to pick up.
,Recommended,420520,34202760,Posted: 12 August,all,Jolly Rancher,"I've been waiting for a game like this for a long time.  One of my favorite games is Brigandine, and there hasn't been anything that's been quite like it that I've found until this game.   If you're unfamiliar with the type, you start out as one of several kingdoms on a map, with a few heroes.  Those heroes can recruit other heroes as well as more run of the mill soliders.  Each turn you can send teams to attack nearby enemy strongholds, with the goal being to take over the entire continent.  The fun, in my opinion, comes from strategically wearing down your opponents (by, for example taking out their most expensive units), while also maintaining and building your own armies.  (Shoring up chokespots, keeping soldiers on the front lines).  So far the game appears to have a lot of depth to it, there are many factions and many characters.   My only complaint so far is that the escape key closes the game, luckily the game autosaves at the start of every turn, as I have hit it accidentally at least 6 times so far.  But, it is what got me to take a break from the game for a few minutes to write this review.For it's price (or even at a much higher price), if you have any interest in the screenshots or the genre in the slightest, I highly recommend it."

There's a lot of depth in the way you mix and match units, generals, skills and formations. The battles can become very large in scale, chaos and mayhem ensuing, with armored knights charging into infantry and mages slinging spells of destruction from behind. There are sieges in the game, and its entertaining to formulate a strategy and watching it unfold as your soldiers storm the castles.This is a game I dreamt of playing as a child -it fulfills a lot of what I wanted to see in a fantasy wargame back then- but the game isn't without its faults. A better UI would have gone a long way and better graphic and resoution options are much desired."
,Recommended,420520,34750649,Posted: 4 September,all,DEVO,"+Fun game, reminds me of Dominions but 1/10 the price. Also quite similar to Dragon Force on the Sega Saturn. Elements of Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Nobunaga's Ambition. Good variety of factions to play as. World map seems to be well constructed for interesting play.-Need a better battle tutorial.-Please translate all factions! (story... they are ALL playable but only 3 have story modes so far)-Let us zoom on strategic map!-UI takes a little getting used to-More zoom in battle would be nice too."
76561198107412374,Recommended,420520,34133741,Posted: 9 August,all,Boargut,"A neat little simulation game with multiple layers you can be a faction ruler a general who rises up the ranks a vagabond or even spectate the world as a bystander and watch the AI fight it out. You can even spectate AI vs AI battles during the campaign so you can watch the major battles without being involved in the game at all.There is multiple factions each with there own diverse roster of fantasy races. However currently only 3 have the story segments and event scenes translated into English.There is no base building or empire managment economy is very simplisitc. However recruiting armies is easy and troops that level up don new armour and become quite powerful.Combat isn't amazing but i wouldn't call it not satisfying you have formations, weapon types different types of magic including summons and healing. Combat is fun to watch but don't expect any fancy animations.Overall the game is an absolute steal for the price you're getting an old school pixel grand strategy game for the price of a single £/$The only downside i have with the game is that it is a little fast especially when you end turns. The dialogue that pops up moves to quickly for you to read in English. I suppose that is the downside of not knowning the native langauge."
76561198045599334,Recommended,420520,34476909,Posted: 25 August,all,Aessidhe,"I have one simple thing to say about this game: where do I sign up and pay for the fully translated version of the game?In more detail: I wasn't expecting a lot about this game for this price, but I quickly found myself totally proven wrong. From the awesome anime style mid-combat speeches and interactions of characters who react to their surrounding and the flow of battle, to the amazing music score, and the surprisingly deep characters and their motivations.If I could improve anything about the game it'd be to give each unit multiple advanced class versions that you can upgrade them into. I'd make faction affinity more understandable and I'd improve officer mode so that rebelling against your faction is an actual option, because now raising your own flag can only be done in neutral provinces, and you never have enough money shortly after raising your flag to fight off established starter factions who are rushing towards conquering all neutral lands.Give this game a try, I promise you won't regret it, and the more of us who buy it, the more likely it is, that we'll get the full version, which would be AMAZING <3 <3 <3"

76561198158149244,Recommended,420520,34255377,Posted: 15 August,all,tuckboat,Very nice little package here. Dense and complex yet immersive and easy to navigate once you get the hang of it. It's a JRPG meets Tolkien stylized War Sim/Strategy Game that's closest big name comparison is Total War. It's an interesting concept and there seems to be a massive amount of content for a couple bucks. The Strategy element largerly takes place in the setup before the battles and could probably use a little tweaking to make in battle decisions feel more meaningful.Bottom line here is you have an excellent price for an interesting game that's biggest failings are probably it's complexity to depth ratio and the fact that only a small portion of the game's scenarios are translated.7/10

,Recommended,420520,34176259,Posted: 11 August,all,Ryou,"Incredibly addicting game which is absolutely worth the price. The game itself plays like a mix between grand strategy and your average RTS, switching between managing forces and your empire on the overworld and commanding troops by hand in battles. While I can't speak for the fact that all factions are balanced by themselves, the game is balanced pretty well in the grand scheme of things.One of the negatives I can list is the clunky AI and the lack of information on certain things. The latter can't be helped due to the fact that it's a Japanese niche game and most information simply hasn't been translated because of how much effort it would take, although I'm sure in due time that'll be fixed.Any strategy fan will want to pick this up though, and I highly doubt you'll find a game this good for such a low price anytime soon."

To provide yet another analogy, it's like Risk with hero units and storyline, and territory battles are short (1-2min) RTS segments.  It's only partially translated, there are little translation issues here and there, the tutorial says make sure to read the manual but the manual hasn't been translated, and some of the UI is awkward, but it's a fun game anyway.After the tutorial I tried the Lizardmen (1-star difficulty) campaign and was promptly crushed by the elves, but I enjoyed subjugating frogs and turtles in my castle's neighboring swamps.The music is great."

I thought I buy a fun little strategy game (which it also is), but the story behind and the characters are insanely well written. And are the main reason I recommend this game.You begin the game by selecting 1 of 11 factions, unfortunately only 3 have a (translated) story, yet (I hope!!!). The game comes down to 3 parts:1.) The ""World-Map"". Here you see the world and the various locations, you recruit Heros, Armys and plan your attacks. Its rather simplistic (but the UI is a bit messy/takes time to get used to), but you get some backstory on the locations (which can change during the game) and you can also get backstory on the many Heros you can potentially hire.2.) The  ""Fight-Map"". Depends on the location you fight in, each has its unique (I believe) map. Its Real Time Strategy, but you can pause. Besides the fact that the micro is a bit though at times, I really enjoy the fighting. All your units lvl up and there are a lot of skills you can use. Depending on your faction/heroes.3.) Story. In between the fighting youll get story, its textbased, but as I already said it is very very well written. And each side has their own viewpoint, issues, motivation... cant wait to play them all."

I spent easily over an hour just reading the information on the various characters and areas on the map, its all pretty alluring, while their were a couple typos I noted, mostly considering this was originally a Japanese game, its well translated. A few description of characters and places were a bit lackluster but overall its a fairly well defined setting.The only flaw I really noted was that the controls were not the most fluid, I felt that moving from menu to menu to not be the easiest to do, or heck when trying to manage your troop movement on the main map caused some problems, but still largely the game is solid and worth giving this a shot.I only wish the rest of the factions had been fully translated to English, their are various factions that looked interesting but would lack their own story at this point sadly it seem. I am really hoping that the Devs that made this game are going to make more games like this."

I've seen (and unfortunately bought) games that cost way more, that do not have nearly as much going for it as this game does. Don't let the cheap price make you think it is going to be a pile of you-know-what. It is worth way more than the $3 I paid. I just hope that the game gets enough attention that they translate the rest of the factions stories. Currently you only get 3 of the faction stories, but can still play any faction you wish."

,Recommended,420520,34141872,Posted: 10 August,all,skirtsuit angel,"give this game a chance. it's cheap. it has charm. it's a labour of love, clearly. it's a unique kind of strategy game - not perfect, a bit unpolished, but it makes up for that in charm.it makes me feel nostalgic for an era i wasn't around for. if you have no trouble adapting to japanese indie games, you'll appreciate it. i really appreciate the sort of chrono trigger era drawings, even if they seem to conflict a bit with the style of the world map and battle scenes - at the same time, all those styles are things i really like. something about the disjointed retro, 16-bitness with the 32 bit quality art is frankly kind of charming.if the screenshots put you off because you think it looks awkward - it's a unique kind of 4x-ish game. it gets me out of most of the things that 4x games do wrong for me. it doesn't feel like you're wasting turns just sort of moving about random squares and waiting your turn. and instead of just ""put these troops against  these troops and let the cpu figure it out"", you have a sort of rts with rpg elements and micromanagement battle interface. i love that.lots of things about this game are clunky. it's a big time mod of a japanese freeware game that was never translated to english. the interface is almost like a sega saturn windows port in some ways, you drag and drop troops into territory you want to invade. but there's a lot of really nice stuff, strategy wise, to play around with here, and it has enough unique hooks and controls and random rpg elements that i'm really, really into it. you can micromanage the way your troops attack in battles, you can make them all attack specific points to choke things off - at the same time, coming to grips with this system is hard. the tutorial explains how to control the game but gives you very little guidance on what you need to do to actually win battles.that's a problem - but the charm of the game, the cheap price, and the appeal strategy games like this have for me means i'm willing to overcome it. it's like 3 bucks. come on. i'm into this.this is probably impossible - but my god would i want multiplayer for this. the game is so cheap it's easy to get other people to get it. if 4D or nanaashi or whoever else is reading - please."

I started as Musket and was doing fairly well but the Knights generals are unstoppable and I imploded shortly after, lol.I haven't tried a kingdom w/the events yet, so I can't judge that aspect but the simulation/strategy part is right in my wheel house and I'm loving it.  Also, I did two battles then after that I skipped.  I less prefer playing the battles and more of the simulation part (I usually do that for games).My favorite feature is Observe (or watch after you doing playing etc...).  I love watching computers fight each other (I used to always do it in Romance of the Three Kingdoms 3 when I was young)!Without doing the tutorial it did take me a bit to figure out when I could and could not recruit a unit and how too (leader units).  My only other complaint is sometimes the menus overlap.  I wish when I select units from one territory to attack another, and click reinforcement it wouldn't stack menu on-top of each-other.Excellent price and very fun game.  Definitely recommended!"

The game is played in two modes a strategic management mode and a Real Time Strategy with pause mode. You can enter a battle and fight it and go back to the other mode on the same turn, you can also move companies after you fight, recruit high level characters once you have one, and put multiple hero units in one company allowing you to improve your army even in the late game. In battle you can also speed things up so battles resolves or progress more quickly.This is a great game at a crazy low price. A lot like Brigandine but a lot faster feeling company based combat like Kohan Immortal  Sovereigns but you can give orders to indivudal units.

Only a portion of the scenarios is playable in English, and only 3 factions have their story content translated (all of them are still fully playable though). However, this is still a decent amount for 3 bucks (I finished my first succesful campaign after around 10 hours in the game).If you want an uncomplicated (but by no means shallow), Risk-like strategy game with Total War-esque RTT battles you cant go wrong with this one."
,Not Recommended,420520,34230570,Posted: 14 August,all,Detrian,"tl;dr: Neat game. Maybe? Er...----I don't even know what to think about this one. Let's break it down so there's no confusion:- As a game I think this is REALLY interesting and deep. In a way it reminds me of Dominions 4 with how units seem to have a lot of stats and skills to them.- The world and lore seems really interesting with a ton of varied races that manage to deviate a bit from the typical fantasyt tropes.- Graphically battles are fun to watch and the style is appealing, despite the game not running too well and the UI being plain, awkward and at times confusing.- If we go by the developer's word then there's a ton of content in the game as is.Why the negative review then? Cause the game's distribution is kind of a confusing mess.As of the time of writing there's only 3 translated campaigns and the rest of the races have had their story mode pulled out of the game (still playable, just without plot). The reasoning for this is that the translation job is a very big task and so they want to see how the games does before commiting to it, with plans to release the rest of the races' plotline as DLC.This by itself sounds ok, considering the game is so cheap, but... there's just no information at all about the process and there's even some confusion about what IS actually in the game. How much could this DLC be? How long could a translation take? Will the game get patches aside from that? Will they finish working on the manual (which is as of yet untranslated)? Is there or is there not mod support? Because some info says there is but then some other posts say they had to take it out for ""copyright reasons"" which is... yeah. I've even had a couple windows come up with gibberish so out there somewhere there's still a couple UI bits that have not been translated.I'm just not sure what to think nor if I want to keep the game without seeing where it goes. As a game it seems like it has a lot of promise but the release leaves a lot to be desired and is frankly a pretty bizarre way to put something on the store. With any luck the developer will see this, they seem pretty active here, and can address some stuff that could potentially bring this into a recommendation.For now I recommend that you at least try it if you want a deep strategy game but be aware that the game could potentially never be fully localized."

This is a very well-thought out and fun grand strategy game for this time of price, in fact, it's a steal. Be aware though, not all factions are playable in story-mode YET, due to lack of localization in English in the game. There are indeed several problems that plague the game. However, I had tons of fun despite that. There's a nice little option to auto-battle or take control of the battle yourself, I usually almost always take control because I simply find the battles fun to watch. There is indeed an ending for all factions and perhaps an (alternative?) ending. So far, it took me a 10 hours to complete a campaign when I was rushing. Although, be aware, due to lack of localization, there are only a limited amount of playable story campaigns. But! You CAN STILL PLAY all factions EXCEPT [Crime] due to it being a Demon Lord-like faction.You could say that this is similar to Japanese Isekai Light Novels or whatever due to the very well-thought out storyboard and background. If you're looking for a fun strategy game with good story, then buy it! Only if you don't mind 2D graphics. The art is indeed wonderful though, to compensate for the pixelated graphics in battle.If you want to deeply invest your time in a 'grand strategy game' then this is for you! Usually it'll take 30 or so hours to complete a SINGLE campaign, and there are ALOT of factions in this game. From the dragon-rider factions to the 'Corrupted Empire' to the 'Aethesitic-Religion-in-the-Dessert' hell, they even included Lizardmen factions and FROG FACTIONS!Each faction has their own dedicated units, from healers to ranged units to close combat to stationary units to cavalries, etc but to add onto that, each one has their own teir as well. For example, an 'Enlistee' can be promoted to a 'Soldier' once he hits level 10. An Enlistee starts out as level 1 and only costs 100 funds, however, a Soldier which is level 10, would cost 1000 funds. Of course, there are exceptions of more powerful 'Enlistees' in each faction such as the Reinhalt Empire's.If you're not into RTS games then might as well play this game Turn-Based style! Yes, you can leave the fighting to the AI and have it skip the actual battle. Though, to RTS players, what's the fun in that? Different strokes for different blokes, this game allows for different types of play-styles and strategies. It's quite similar to the Total War series, albeit ONLY slightly. I believe if you had a blast with the Total War series and want a refreshing, quick-play. Then this game is definitely for you.A bit of a warning, at first, you'll be COMPLETELY overwhelmed by the information when you actually start playing, that's why there's a tutorial, please play that! This game's map is quite large and since it is quite large, there are often tons of factions that surround you and want to stab you in the back. As I've said, this game is indeed difficult but not too difficult that SAVE-AND-LOAD can't fix! Screwed up trying to defend your city? Welp, load and retry, try a different strat and use the abilities of your troops much more efficiently! Yes, there are abilities in this game and there are a ton. Buffs, special magic, lasers from dragons and such exist in this world. Mowing down infantry with a single dragon laser breath is absolutely euphoric. If you feel a bit lonely then why not try Diplomacy?A weak point in this game is its diplomacy. Everyone wants to kill each other and want your stuff, your land and your women. Thankfully, the AI isn't so bad that it disregards the alliance pact it forms. But, when it boils down to trying to make friends and/or enemies, it's just about funds. There's no such thing as 'negotiating' just give them gold and they'll♥♥♥♥♥♥off elsewhere. You can't engage in a talk with faction leaders either, which deeply disappointed me.However, don't let this turn you away! This is a grand startegy game in the end and what's more fun than conquering stuff? In the end, this game is a small 3$ game but plays like a 15$ game should and is weeeelll worth the price. It isn't some triple AAA game and you should look elsewhere if you're looking for a Civilization copy. If you lower your expections by a bit, you'll be greatly shocked at how fun this game can be.So far, I would rate this as a7.2for a strategy game.My personal opinion and fun-factor for this though would have to be8.4If 5 was head-ache inducing horrible achne and 10 was a plate of never ending chicken nuggets."

This heavily reminds me of Spectral Force Genesis on the DS.The controls are where this game fails at as controlling your army is weird at the best of time and down right uncontrollable at the worst. The formations that you create by dragging the mouse works well enough but I end up just selecting the auto function most of the time.On another note I'm not to sure this game is finished(?). Some parts of the story are yet to be included as well as some functions not there. If they keep working on it an improving it has the potential to be an AMAZING game but as of right now it's just barely ok and simply passes the mark for being the only title on steam at the moment that combines this sort of anime, grand strategy, rts.It's good enough for it's price and you won't be losing anything if you pick it up whenever. Recommended if your and anime and strategy fan.7/10 (Playing this game made me realize I really want a new pc version of a game like Spectral Force Gensis)"

A pity since you can miss the great level of detail and following your heroes in a battle can become a bit of a challenge.+/- The ai on campaign level seems decent, making treaties and invading, the battle ai is basic but will still keep it's archers behind infantry, etc. Seems to struggle a little with sieges both defending and attacking, but since total war still has this issue it's seems unfair to level much blame here.+/- There is a learning curve  (though I found the tutorial gave me what I needed to start me off), could do with a being a bit clearer about what certain abilities do and being able to view enemy stats and abilities would be useful as well.Overall really impressed with the quality of this, it's surprisingly fun and addictive and you can see there's a lot of heart and passion that's gone into creating it. For the price it's at (£1.99 at this time) it's an absolute bargain in my opinion."

If you loved Dragon Force, Brigandine, Ogre Battle, or want something a bit like a Japanese total war game I'd highly recommend Lost Technology. Yes, there is not a ton of strategic depth at the overmap level, but the combat itself is fantastic fun. For instance if you play lizardmen you can use the fast you move very fast on water to slam into an enemies backline and wipe out their mages. Elves move much faster in forests and allows for strafing style tactics.However, some characters are indeed much better than others."

76561197964112637,Recommended,420520,34161466,Posted: 10 August,all,PerfectDeath,"To sum the game in one sentance.  It feels like Anime Risk.There is more to it than that with unit leveling and real-time strategy combat like the total war games taking away the RNG of Risk.With such a cheap price it is certainly worth the purchase, just expect to be frustrated with some of the UI and Dialog.  It takes a bit to get used to the controls, interacting with the units, the map and the AI behaviour.  If you want to experience the game's Lore, set everything to automated and spectate everything you can.  Other wise you will miss out on a lot of character conversation during the battles.Of course, the game is only partially translated and the voice overs are all in japanese and some of the lore is missing until localized.  But hey, it is $3.00 which is pretty good even with missing content.As a strategy game... it is not the smoothest.  Walls block your view and units can have a hard time pathing with obstacles around them.  Unit commands are going to take some adjustments, there are some hotkeys that help manage units and you can create new groups adding to the default two Vanguard and Rearguard.  Adding new groups is something you need to do if you do not want your calvary acting like front line units.  Middle mouse button pauses the game btw.  Take that opportunity to sort everything out.The groups you make are saved but apply to every following battle including those of other armies other armies, you have to change them every time you use a different army since they are not compatible.The command grouping is pretty 'bleh' but things play out well enough without a polished alternative.Understanding what is happening to your units is a little difficult as well, you can track all unit HP and can see damage numbers.  Some character abilities are pretty obvious and very dangerous; however, I'm still scratching my head about why 1/4 of my army died instantly when attacking the elves in their territory.  I am pretty sure they dumped their special abilites, which I missed seeing because we are fighting in a dense forrest with numbers and status effects popping up all over our units.I have done a lot of early games to get a feel of the initial game; however, I do not know how the game plays out in the later turns.  It feels like snowballing can happen.  But of course with some pretty big abilities, terrain modifiers, defensive positions, squad limits on different maps, etc it can be very easy for a prepared defense to beat a snow ball force."

,Recommended,420520,34136668,Posted: 9 August,all,MrProfilen,"Started off with a 4-star difficulty nation on normal. Instantly hooked after I figured out how everything works. This game is 3$, and it's well worth it. If you have the money, buy it!EDIT: After playing a little more, I thought I'd cover what I've decided are the best difficulties. There are 4 difficulties.Easy - Self explanitory, there are no negatives to the players, and no boost to the AI.Normal - Same as easy, except player has Fog of War (recommend this in the beginning).Hard - Same as normal, except AI now have access to advanced units, instead of just the player. As the campaign goes on, via training, recruitment, and battle, the AI's troops will upgrade.Luna(lunar? don't remember the exact term) - I really like this one, a lot. Basically, you can only control your main squad/general. So, you get control over your general plus his/her/it's units. You have the ability to recruit vassals for more units/squads. You get to do this as you  rank up and recieve money via battles (plunder/spoils). If you go to a territory without the faction leader/higher ranking general, you can invade territories and command any squads that are in the territory you're attacking from. The  Faction leader (AI) can command you to attack territories. You'll often find yourself with just your squad and half a squad (4 units) attacking a fortress, yea good luck.All in all, I'm really digging this game, I'll add more as I play."

The game looks complex, but is very simple and somewhat uninteresting after about an hour of play.2. The battles are very blob oriented.3. The characters are very unbalanced. Some characters are overwhelmingly strong with AOE abilities and can crush groups of enemies, while others are limited to melee combat and just are not really impactful.I know this game is only $3.00 - when dealing with games this inexpensive I don't grade them on price, I grade them on time. I just don't think this game is worth your time. It doesn't really do any one thing well, and tries to front load a lot of ""stuff"" to make up for it. I really wish this was a $20.00 game that was good rather than a $3.00 that just seems like it doesn't do anything well."

The game starts with little screen mode.Player can't change to the FullScreenMode in the game.If the player want to change, the player should start the game by clicking  FullScreenMode.bat file in the game folder.Bad thing is that the time played is not recorded in Steam. (==> No Steam cards)I played more than 20 hours.2. During the battle, heroes talk.The character and the subtitle appears on the right of the screen.But it is hided byI can't even move aside 'the Units health bar screen'."
