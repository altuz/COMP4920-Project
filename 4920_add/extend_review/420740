Set up like a classic murder mystery story ala Clue, Agathie Christie, etc....only with the twist that YOU are the murderer and have to find different ways to murder your sister and then make it seem that somebody else did it. Because of the variety here, you will easily get many playthroughs of the game as you explore the possibilities. Each playthrough should take 30 minutes or so (+/- depending on how thorough and/or careful you are).An easy recommendation, and it also happens to feature a 50 cent price tag right now (during the Winter sale), but it's standard 1 dollar price tag is still a great price for this game. Fairly well a must own IMO."

After the first playthrough (which lasts for about ten minutes) you would roughly have an idea of what to do and what not to do to get the ending that you want. This greatly reduces the replayability of it. I have unlocked all achievements but really the process was not very fun.With that being said, I'll still mark this game as Recommended. I guess you can't ask for much considering its price. In fact, this game has a great concept and a good art style. Plus, I actually enjoyed it a lot during my first playthrough and I felt that that experience alone was already worth the money. If they are gonna make another game of this series I would probably buy it too."

There is a lot of replayability. Also worth noting, there are no tutorials, but the game is pretty straight-foward. There also are no options, and the game is a small window, but you can easily Alt-Enter to enter fullscreen. The lore is quite deep and the game goes into your history, for its length.Overall, a good buy, especially for the price it's at right now."
,Recommended,420740,32063569,Posted: 30 May,all,Paikia,"The Deed is a short, dark, atmospheric point & click adventure, in which you're tasked with committing a murder.Obviously, the goal is to do the dirty deed with the least significant consequences to yourself, meaning you're going to try to either frame someone else for the murder, or simply avoid getting blamed for it yourself (leaving it unsolved). While each single playthrough can be very short, the game does offer you different ways to achieve your goal, each with a different result, so the point is to have plenty of playthroughs, kind of like how it goes in Long Live The Queen, for example.The gameplay itself is very simple. During the first couple of acts, your job would be to talk to people, trying to lead the conversations in the direction you want, while picking up two items out of the junk scattered around the house. One item should serve as a murder weapon, while the other's function is to be a false, planted evidence, meant to lead the police to suspect the victim you'd like to frame.After doing the deed itself, you'll be interviewed by a police detective, having to answer questions perhaps explain your behavior. Again, just like during the previous phase, the idea is to lead the detective to the conclusion you're interested in. As soon as you're done, you're given the outcome of the game. Being consistent and logical, it's pretty easy to get to the result you want, but despite that fact, I've found the game to be entertaining enough, especially considering its low price.Don't expect anything special regarding graphics or music, as the entire focus of the game is the plot. Also, I did experience the occasional crash, losing my progress, but since each playthrough is so short anyway, there's wasn't too much progress to lose to begin with.All in all, this is a cute little mystery game, definitely worthy of its price tag, in my opinion."
,Recommended,420740,20248610,"Posted: 3 January, 2016",all,"Communist ""Joseph Ballin"" Layton","The Deed is a short RPG Maker game with a funny name where your goal is to murder your sister. You spend the first part of the game wandering the house and talking with your family while searching for weapons to use for the murder or for evidence to plant, and then after taking two items you move into the murder phase, in which you use the items you picked up to try to set up a murder that pushes the blame away from you. It's a simple game, but the different items and locations do just enough to lend a bit of creativity to it. If you just go for a successful murder and leave it at that you'll probably finish the game fairly quickly, but the fun of it is doing various things just to see what happens. You can challenge yourself by trying to get away with killing your sister with your bare hands, or see what the inspector says when you show up to the interview with things like your sister's underwear. It's not the deepest or the longest game, but for $1 The Deed is a pretty neat little diversion."

Basically your job is to try to engineer the perfect murder without getting caught. You do this by exploring the home for items you can use to implicate others in the murder. Who you choose to speak to, what you say, where you go, etc all have consequence on the final outcome.ProsWell-made- Good production values and plays well.Nice graphics- You do get a sense you're really in an old mansion exploring the rooms.Fun- Very immersive and enjoyable because you are eager to see whether you get away with things.Many different configurations- E.g. Choose whether or not to talk to different people, what to say to them if you do, what weapon to use, what evidence to plant, etc.Many different endings- E.g. Do you end up in jail? Or frame your father for the murder? Or maybe the maid? Etc.Fresh premise- How often do you get to play a game where the objective is to kill someone you've always hated and frame someone else for it?!Some good exploration- Interact with items to experience flashbacks on some.ConsGets repetitive- After the first play, it sort of loses its charm, and your sole purpose becomes engineering a different ending from what you initially got.Not very logical- Real-life murders aren't really solved like that; the investigating officer never considers that evidence may have been planted by someone else.The butler looks too young- He's supposed to be near retirement age for god's sake, but his picture makes him look 30 at most!Too short- 10 minutes. What can I say?Story too sparse- Could've done with more content, more characters, more possibilities.I grabbed this at S$0.67 (~US$0.47) so no real complaints. At least the quality of this game was good, and the overall experience was enjoyable. I wouldn't pay more than US$0.50 for this though, as it's just way too short. No doubt there are different endings, but once you've played it once through, you already know more or less what will happen with your choices this time round."

He is traveling to his home for his abusive fathers birthday, but the is also travelling there with a sinister plan, to murder his sister who is stealing his fathers business after he dies.The Deed has a very simple premise, once you arrive you have three tasks. Find how you're gonna kill your sister, get the tools and evidence to get away with it and do The Deed.Once you arrive you case the mansion getting to know about your sister to find weaknesses such you can use against her. It's all very interesting and it's fun casing around to look for clues and tools to kill your sister.Now for some of the bad things:The graphics and soundtrack are all very bland. I know a lot of these games are built with pre made assets and I get that some games are great, but it's still it's all very bland.Grammar issues are present. Some words are misspelled and a few are mushed together example He is gonnakill her, stuff like thatThe game is short. It takes 20 minutes to complete a single playthrough. But it has a lot of replay value. Multiple endings, multiple tools to kill your sister and you can blame people to get different endings. So you have at the very least 2 hours of content if you're planning on 100% the game.Overall The Deed surprised me on how good it was. It's not the best RPG maker game I've seen, but it's not bad and for the price it's quite fun, so get it on sale and have yourself a good time.Final Rating:7/10Pros:+ Interesting Concept+ Tons of replay valueCons:- Bland graphics and sound effects"

On my first playthrough I chose the love letter and placed it in the maid's room, and a leather whip that the father used to beat his children with and placed that in the storage room. This left me with no weapon so I had to use my hands and strangle my sister.  In the end I was convicted of the murder, but this left me wanting more.For the price this is a fun game with several ways the story can play out, but I'm sure once you have seen most of the endings you probably wont want to come back to it. Achievements would be nice and might keep me playing longer but for now I am just going to keep playing until I get away with murder."

,Recommended,420740,20980533,"Posted: 5 February, 2016",all,Dr. Mircow,"The Deed is a RPG Maker game with a traditional murder mystery setting. The story revolves around Arran Bruce who recently discovers that his abusive father removed him from his Will in favour of his cruel sister to inherit the family belongins. Furious about this, he decides to eliminate his sister in order to restore his own, rightful, inheritance.The gameplay is all about getting away with the murder of Arran’s sister and trying to blame someone else for it. The player has the choice of who to talk to, what topics to discuss in conversations, which evidence to plant, the method of murder and how to handle the interview when interrogated at the end. Consequently, the paths chosen influence the final outcome (e.g. the ending), and that is all there is to its very minimal gameplay. Generally, a single playthrough takes roughly about 20-30 minutes at normal pace with all rooms fully explored and every possible conversation exhausted. In other words, it is all about solving the one single puzzle: getting away with murder. As a result, the game has a replayability value until the player discovers all the possible methods of committing the crime (while being undetected and without people being suspicious) and various endings. Likewise, this is good news for any achievement hunters who want to achieve 100% completion as it is very easy to accomplish it.Admittedly, the writing is nothing terrific, and most of it is forgettable anyway, but it is enough to provide context for the puzzle. The very few set-pieces such as the flashblacks are a nice touch since they provide some backstory, aside from simply talking with other people, but that is as deep as the story can get, which is not a lot. Then again, the game’s length is extremely short after all, therefore there is hardly time to expand the story. Ultimately, The Deed is clearly not a purely story-driven game. As mentioned previously, it is all about solving the one puzzle.The visuals are on par with what anyone should expect from a RPG Maker game. Thankfully, the game does not bluntly rely on stock assets which makes it stand out amongst the majority of half-hearted RPG Maker games out there, but as a whole it is clearly not as stunning as something like To The Moon, as far as RPG Maker games are concerned. It does a somewhat effective use of the dark tone and browny colour pallet to create at least a creepy atmosphere, even if there is nothing remotely creepy or even scary about it. Furthermore, there is no voice acting (as per usual with most RPG Maker games) and the sound effects used are minimal and rather uninspiring. The soundtrack is unmemorable, much like the writing, but does an adequate job in setting up the mood.In conclusion, The Deed has a simple but interestingly fun little concept despite everything about it being fundamentally way too basic. The game has clear shortcomings which could have been easily avoided in the first place. For instance, the length could have been greatly improved through the use of more elaborate ways of committing the crime and the atmosphere could have also been enhanced by using eerier sound effects. Evidently, there has been a missed opportunity on expending the story due to both the writing and length letting it down. However, considering the price tag, all of these shortcomings are tolerable in this case since anyone can easily purchase the game for “free” by selling any marketable items in their Steam inventory, thus eliminating any notion of a buyer’s remorse. In actual fact, the game should have been (properly) free in the first place. For a fun fact, I bought the game for 7p during a sale by selling a Steam emoticon.If you fancy the concept at least and can lower your expectations, I recommend giving The Deed a shot as it can be fun figuring out a way without being caught, but also mainly because of its price tag. Possibly the shortest, yet forgettable, fun you will ever have in a game."

Adding to this the fact that the game is less than a dollar I'd say it's worth a shot to experience it for yourself."

Dunshiel House staff: one butler and one maid/cook.A classic ""who-dun-it"" from the murder's point of view.Storyline:  Estranged Arran Bruce returns home for his father's 50th birthday with the sole purpose to murder his sister, Jennifer.  Motive: Money, of course.  The father, Malcolm, is about to disinherit him in favor of his sister.  The question is: How to commit murder and still walk away a free man.  10 murder weapons, and 5 other people who can take the blame, assuming one does not get caught.  Of course, there is always the ""mysterious"" intruder too. (Lizzie Borden will have good company if one manages that.)One ending and multiple ways to get there.Basic gameplay:Start the evening by arriving at Dunshiel House and briefly chat with the maid.  (Remember everything one says to anyone, now and later, can and will be used against them.)  Keep the coat or give it to the maid.  Talk to the family or ignore them.  Talk to the servants or ignore them too.  Relive some memories or not.  Choose the weapon, find the evidence then go to dinner.  Make a scene, be cordial, make pointed observations.  All in preparation for the murderous deed.After dinner plant the evidence then commit murder.Note: Game mechanics only allows for one murder weapon plus bare hands and one piece of incriminating evidence to be planted somewhere in the house.  However, if the player choses bare hands the ""murder"" weapon will still be on their person.  Nor does evidence have to be planted which also will be found on their person when the Inspector arrives.During the interview, there is a physical search, so if there is a weapon or evidence still on their person there had better be a very good explanation.  After the interview the verdict is handed down, and the player discovers if they got away with murder or not.Two brief scenerios from my own gameplay:My favorite scenerio was having both a murder weapon (the fencing sword) and evidence (the tawse) on my person when the interview began and still framing the father for murder.  (I framed the father often and usually inherited everything only for Arran to somehow develope a huge conscious which made everything bleak and despairing.)  (Well murder is wrong and framing someone else even more so, so I guess the developers did not want the player to forget that.)My best and most apropos scenerio was the sister's ""suicide"" with a mirror shard.  Reason: unrequited love for the maid.  That was a bit tricky since if done incorrectly the unassuming maid was framed.Has all the makings of the board game Clue ,,, only in reverse.   A clever game with a clever premise and multiple ways to get away with murder.  Well worth the price."

This can either help or hinder you depending on what you said to who and where. I don't want to spoil anything but it may be seen as suspicious asking certain characters questions or being witnessed in a room where the murder weapon came from. If you forgot to plant the evidence or a weapon it could have interesting implications when the inspector finds them in your possession.For a price of less than £1 it's easily worth it, there are several endings and it's interesting to play a game where every conversation and action you take gets brought back up again."

I wasn't expecting much for a game made in RPG Maker and priced at 49p but I was absolutely shocked by what came out of it.The plot of The Deed is that you play a man that hates his family and decides to kill his sister. Your challenge is to carry out this deed by finding weapons around the house and deciding what might be the most appropriate and then you need to find a piece of evidence that might link to the weapon that you use. One thing that I don't like about this game is that it doesn't exactly explain why the d*ckhead of a main character is actually carrying out this deed, and even on his sister, the father I fealt like would have been a more appropriate character to kill as the father is a completely hateable character. What I will praise the game for is the way it's paced and how it punishes you. If you try and rush throught he game as quick as possilbe, choose the first weapon you see and the first evidence you see, it's gonna make sure you get the bad ending. However, if you take your time to converse with the people in the house, look around in the rooms, carefully planning out what you're going to do, I can guarantee you that The Deed will be carried out with success. And yes, this game has 4 different endings (although 1 of them can have around 8 variations but these variations are quite minor.)There isn't that much to say about the graphics, it's basically the typical sort of graphics you would expect from an RPG Maker game, bare bones but relatively decent but one thing that I'd like to bring up are the face models on the characters. Some of them sort of look a bit weird and out of place, primarily the main character.When there isn't much to the game, there isn't really much to talk about, is it good, yes but only for the price.

To do so, you must carefully consider which murder weapon to choose, what evidence to plant, and which aspersions to cast to create a cogent narrative of someone else’s guilt.Despite the overall bad reputation of RPGmaker games (and I myself have played some pretty atrocious ones), The Deed is a rare example of a well-made one: interesting premise, nice-looking sprites, and (most importantly) well-written dialogue. The game is short (around 15 minutes per run), but figuring out how to frame each member of the family gives it a fair amount of replayability. Given the low price and the short time investment, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone with even a slight appreciation for murder mysteries."

In fact, my only complaint is that there is nothing left for me to do in-game, and I haven't earned a single card drop. ;)I picked it up because, why not, it was 49 cents, and the idea of a Clue-esque video game tickled me a bit. Finding the right evidence to plant (and where to plant it) as well as the appropriate murder weapon can take a bit of tinkering, but honestly, the inspector gives away a lot of information during the interrogation. After two or three playthroughs, you'll have a pretty good idea of what implicates who. (Although, it was by chance that I found out that having something on you while you're being searched can be really helpful. You'll feel so smart when you figure that one out. -grin-)Obviously I wish that the game had a little more variance in dialogue, some much-needed mouse/WASD recognition, and a few other small things that would really add some polish.

There is a plethora of weapons to do just that - and a number of items of evidence you can use to pin the crime on members of your family or their staff. There are a number of endings based on if you were successful in your crime, and with what weapons you used and what evidence you placed.It gets to the point where if you rush (which is more likely if you're going for multiple endings and you already know the dialog) you can complete the game within five minutes. This is very short which I feel is this game's only downside; but for what you're paying it's no huge deal - it's still a bargain for what it is.

You play a guy who comes from a rich family and you have major problems with your abusive dad, and your psychotic ( and also abusive ) sister. Your dad cuts you out of the will, so on his fiftieth birthday, you return home to see him and celebrate. Only its a ruse. Since he cut you out, your sister is the one inheriting everything. So your goal in this game is to kill her, and not get caught. Whether you blame it on someone else, make it look like a suicide, or get caught on purpose either for the achievement or just for giggles, is entirely up to you. The actual game is only about 10 minutes long but its worth AT LEAST 3 play throughs for someone who will get bored of it quickly, and close to 3-4 hours for someone who wants to experience everything in it. The only real fault I see in this game is that you cant really get a good ending. It's a story where you're FORCED to kill your sister ( theres talk that you can have her put into an asylum, but I havent done this or seen anyone else do it. just heard you can so i wana mention that ) and no matter which of the endings you get and no matter who you frame your character always ends up sad and miserable. Wouldve liked one additional ending that was really hard to get but you end up happy because of it. He finally got revenge on his abusive sister. And if you frame the dad, He got revenge on him too, AND your mom who let the abuse happen for years, as she dies alone now. Not to mention the fortune and mansion he inherits. But thats really the only negative. For its $0.99 price tag, ( it's $0.66 on sale right now ) This is a damn good game. 8.5/10."

It is played as a sort of RPG from a top-down view in which you are given freedom to explore the large house and collect items. However, in the effort of keeping realistic, you are only allowed to pick up two things, and only the sort of items that a person would actually be able to conceal.It is a unique scheme that makes for a fun game. Unfortunately, after several playthroughs, it turns out that it's actually pretty easy to get away with murder. You'll discover what types of objects you need to combine to succeed.For example, not quite a spoiler but if you want a hint:If you hide a piece of evidence involving another person, and use a weapon relating to them, they will be successfully framed every time. One such choice would be to hide love letters to the maid in her room, and then use glass from her broken mirror to commit the crime.I would need to play further to be 100% sure of this, but I do think your dialogue choices matter. In example, I'm pretty sure if you threaten the family then the inspector will make you for the crime regardless of the evidence you plant. However, these dialogue choices are fairly limited and it is usually obvious which one you need to select to seem the least suspicious.Despite this game being very short, there is definitely a good amount of replay value here. Given that the game is only $0.99, I'd say it is priced quite fairly. I've played many indie games that are just as short as this one and have no replay value, that cost far more.I recommend it.

Yes, it's very short no matter how you go about trying to accomplish ""the deed"", but it's also very interesting in that there are so many different approaches and that the real story is an internal one that you have to work out for yourself so that this fosters a rare feeling of true roleplay. When I say ""short"" I mean that a typical playthrough can take about 15 minutes.

I wouldn't know by playing it except for the menu and stuff.You Pick two items and from each one has context. This will effect how you can plan to arrange to kill your sister! Example, the shotgun is your father's. Then there are non-weapons which belong to others too and have their own context. You can only pick two, which when chosen immediately goes to the Dinner section.The game has four stages: 1:Pre-Dinner Item Collecting, 2:Dinner, 3:Planting Evidence if you want, and killing sister 4: Post-Mortem interview.Throughout most stages all taking place in most of the same place you interact and this impacts your game. If you don't tell your father Happy Birthday it's not a huge problem but it is suspicious. Each conversation or lack of has some minor or major impact later. In the interview after you plant evidence if you want, and kill your sister [via weapon or hands] you are interviewed by police. I won't spoil this beyond it's funny if you forget to plant evidence or don't use a weapon.... Though you can sometimes get away with it.Great game, not long, though worth the price and some good fun replay value especially if you wanna try out specific plans in game to see what happens.Don't forget what you do! And remember that after you kill, depending on how, you get a limited set of seconds to go to another area and it might be a little difficult knowing where you are when the body is found.

Without giving too much of the story away, you're basically an heir to a rich family and you need to get rid of your sister in order to get the deed to the house.There\'s a few characters around the house whom you can interact with each one with their own dialogue and opinions regarding the main character and other NPCs.There are several ways to do the ""deed"" and inherit the ""deed"" and answering right or wrong during the investigation begins is a whole different story in itself as in you have to actually back up your story/alibi so you don't get caught.The game is very short, little bit more than 30 minutes per different story progression and you can get 100% quite easily.

The music is perfectly atmospheric, and since a single playthrough is so short, it never becomes grating.Speaking of atmosphere, there's something truly enjoyable about playing the bad guy in a game.

It's basically a murder mystery; only you are the murderer, and must create an alibi and plant incriminating evidence in order to get away with it.  There was a lot of fun in exerimenting throughout my different play-throughs: who will I pin this on?  How will I cover my tracks? Etc.  A single play-through can be done in about ten minutes, but all the different scenarios give it a nice replayability.While the characters seemed to go out of their way to be unlikable (including the ""protaganist""), I think that was the point.  It makes it easier to frame one of them, or if you are caught, that game over screen doesn't feel so bad when you know that ""our hero"" deserved it.  The overtones of the game are very dark, and you know that no one will get out with a happy ending.  Even victory has a bitterness to it.I really only have two complaints, the first being that some of the dialogue choices would get pretty old after seeing them so many times.  Some characters only have a few ways to interact with them, and you figure out which ways are most benificial pretty fast.  My other complaint is in the sound department.  A variety of creepy ambient songs would go a long way, however, since this game is meant to be played multiple times, repetitive music would get old fast.If you see this game on sale, or you just want a dark new experience, give The Deed a try.

,Recommended,420740,25742637,"Posted: 28 September, 2016",all,nobody,"This is a short game which requires a bit of preparation and planning. It is split into four main parts after the intro - first, you explore the house, talk to whomever you wish to (planting seeds for pt.3),  find an item to plant as evidence and an item to use as the murder weapon. Part 2 is Dinner, where more conversation is made and more seeds can be planted for part three (good or bad). This is followed by you planting the evidence item, committing the murder and alibi-ing youself by being somewhere else VERY quickly, before the final part in which you are interrogated by the polis. The prep & planning comes in as you decide who you want to frame (you can also get a suicide verdict) and how you want to frame them. You also have to talk about the right things during conversations if you want to really nail that coffin lid down! When you are questioned, you need to remember what you've said and where you've been/were, or it could all come unstuck for you.What I liked about this game was the replayability of it - due to the multiple endings (7 'who'/10 'how') and the brevity of it. There's a fair amount of depth for such a short game, although some of it does become quite repetitive and you can hit the wrong answers by flicking too fast through the dialogue. Well thought out game, with a little twist at the end.TLDR: Kill horrible sister, frame innocent people and inherit the world. Fun, short game."

It doesn't promise too much, and what it does promise it delivers quite well.I didn't replay it completely to get every ending, but I did get several endings, and I like the effort put into the various possibilities.What I appreciate the most--what prompted me to post this review--is the writing. Nothing award-winning, but compared with so many other indie RPGs, VNs, and gamebooks I've read and played lately, the writing here is refreshingly good. The characters don't go far beyond mere sketches, but that's okay for a modest tale such as this. The dialogue is natural, and the bleakly hostile relationships are well expressed; so too is the overall grim and creepy mood. And the writing doesn't have many technical problems (grammar, spelling, punctuation), another thing that puts it a tier above so many other little indies.For that, it deserves a recommendation."

But, it’s probably your typical murder mystery game.The game’s pretty easy, all you have to do is to murder your sister without anyone finding out that you did it, and you have to frame someone else to be the prime suspect + make the person suffer in prison rather than yourself. A li'l bit cruel, isn’t it?To be honest, I was hesitant at first if I should buy it or not. I even had to consult my best friend by asking him regarding the game, 'cause I’m quite curious ‘bout it. In the end, I still bought it. I’m really fond of Mystery & Thriller games, so this game really caught my attention.I completed the game, including the achievements (of course, with a guide) in less than three hours and 30 minutes. I’m actually satisfied with the game, and I was having fun all throughout the gameplay.The downside of the game for me is that whenever I press the F12 key, my whole game crashes.

You have to do this by using the correct murder weapon, hiding evidence in the right place and - most important - draw the Police officers attention to one of the family members by directing conversations into the right direction.The game always ends with you being interrogated by the police, and during this interrogation you get a lot of feedback about how the things you did and said during the game influence the outcome of the investigation. This information is vital to do things better the next time, until in the end you will be able to frame the person you want or even let the murder look like a suicide.While the playtime is very short (you could finish the game in a few minutes), you will most likely play it over and over to find out all possible conversation lines and to find out how far your different behaviour will change the things that happen later.The author has put a lot of work into the conversations and their impact on the investigations, and there is a lot to try out, provided that you are the type of gamer who likes to replay conversations to see how they impact the storyline.It took me 3 hours to find out most (or all?) of the endings and get all achievements, and they were well spent.So for this price I can only highly recommend this game."

Your goal is to commit a murder and get away with it, and the gameplay involves exploring a house and interacting with people, leading up to committing the deed.There are a half-dozen people to converse with, including your intended victim. Conversation is varied, includes multiple choices, and may go in any number of directions, all of which may have an affect on the outcome of your playthrough.Exploring the house, you are allowed to pick up two items to be used later. One can be used as the murder weapon, and one may be planted as evidence against someone else in the house.Once you have selected two items, dinner is served, during which you must choose whether to speak and how to respond to the various discussions around the table.After dinner, you may again converse with people, and may choose from a number of places to stash your evidence. When you finally enter the room with your intended victim, you commit the murder, and have an amount of time, depending on the circumstances, to flee the scene before the death is discovered.The investigator arrives, and questions you and everyone else present, and you must choose answers to his questions. At the end, the investigator announces his findings, giving some insight into how he came to his conclusions, and the ultimate decision of who he believes is the guilty party. A number of different endings are possible.Everything you say and do, from the start of the game to the finish has the potential to affect the outcome of the game. You can strive to simply cover your own guilt, or you can aim to indict a specific person in the house. The game has enormous replayability.The visuals, especially the character portraits, are very high quality, and the sheer diversity of the various scenarios make this a flawless game, and your enjoyment of it will depend solely on whether you are interested in this type of gaming experience.

It's a simple rpg-maker style game that feels more like a choose-your-own-adventure than an RPG. There isn't that much to do but for a self-contained 15 minute story it does a good enough job.You play as the villainous son returning to the family estate for the sole purpose of murdering your sibling so as to claim the inheritance. Each playthrough includes dialogue and a couple of choices (murder weapon, planted evidence), allowing for some replayability as pretty much everyone in the house can be framed for the murder (or no one, depending on decisions made by the player). I felt bad when I accidentally framed the maid. Sorry, hotcakes.But once you play through a few times to see how the choices change the ending it becomes apparent that there's not much variability. Also it does feel a bit icky to play as such a little♥♥♥♥♥♥of a character, even if some of the other characters are also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and he seems to get a bad ending no matter what.

,Recommended,420740,19263197,"Posted: 25 November, 2015",all,Evil incarnate,"*NON SPOILER REVIEW*The Deed is a great example of a simple but fun game, no deep epic storyline with twisting conflicting backstory or characters you're forced to give a damn about. The game sets itself up with the bare essentials and it is up to you, the player, to explore further into the game's story. Now what makes this game stand out is how this is optional and how it feels much like a board game such as Cluedo, or even a choose-your-own-adventure book. You have the characters, the premise, the 'clues' and methods. There's multiple ways to approach each event that takes place throughout the day.With this, The Deed indeed gives off a natural fruition of replayability and it's unlikely you will succeed in committing the crime the first couple of tries. You should note who you talk to, when you do and for what reason - but be careful - revealing the truth of why you did to any NPCs can alter your chances of being caught or not as they may seem suspicious of your behaviour. Given the natural conflict you have with your father, even being kind can give your purpose away. It truly, truly feels like your choices have actual, permanent changes to both the NPCs and environment.It's amazing how a game less than $1 can offer so much fun, replayability and investment from an immersive and interesting point of view and do so much right more than AAA modurn gaemz (especially from the overrated joke that is Telltale Games and more recently Life is Strange). This game proves you do not need top-tier voice acting, explosions, quest markers and a mini-map to spoon-feed the player into being artificially interested in the game's world.As I said, this brings me back to the days of board games and choose-your-own-adventure, not many video games can do that for me nowadays so it's refreshing to see one that does it - and does it right - for a criminally underpriced price. I strongly recommend this game to players who love choice and freedom, board games, RPGs and detective stories. I understand the simplicity in nature, the questionable 2D art style and lack of dudebro shooting will put alot of people off, but I feel given the price of the game it doesn't matter if you don't even like the game as you'll probably just refund it anyway.A couple of things I want improved however, is perhaps a real-time on-screen inventory system as opposed to the default JRPG-esque inventory menu, more original sound effects to boot and an in-game clock that you can view anytime. Perhaps with the grandfather clock. Aside from that, I would like to see more games of this nature by this developer - more scenarios in different environments?"

Unfortunately, this game isn't deeply designed enough to let you get really creative with your methods. In particular, you're limited to planting one piece of evidence before the murder, and using your bare hands is basically an instant fail, since you don't have enough time to get away.Considering that the whole premise of the game is finding unique ways to kill your victim and frame somebody else, and that there are only 14 items in the game, the fact that it can't deliver on every combination is a bit of a letdown.

Picture a story in your head of how she dies using the items lying around the house, and put it into action. That is defiantly the strongest part of this game, everything is incredibly logical and the game throws no off the wall curve balls at you. Your plan is not going to be sabotaged by some BS variable that seemed irrelevant, but instead by your own clumsiness, or the things you said. Due to the games incredibly short length, getting all of the endings is a very doable task and gives you plenty of room to play around.That said the game does have some faults. While watching the detective piece your crime together is fun, he is not very smart. It can be alarmingly easy to get him off your back on certain issues which should raise more suspicion. Like saying you kept your coat on to stay warm, despite it being drenched by the rain. Or accusing him of asking you a leading question about your behavior, yet when he asks a leading question about your father immediately you play along with it. It makes it kind of obvious that he follows a point system to reach his verdict.While the characters feel realistic for the most part, I did feel the sister's dialog was a little cartoony. I know she has a disorder, but she really showed no redeemable qualities and did not really have a reason to hate you as much as she did.I also felt the flashbacks were a wasted opportunity, they are kind of interesting at first, but only tell you things you already know.Despite the few nitpicks I had with the game, I did not regret playing this. The aesthetic reminded me of Clock Tower, and the fact that everything you say and do has consequences is truly impressive, and I will keep an eye peeled on this developer if they should ever construct bigger projects.Also the game costs as much as a bag of potato chips, so there really is no excuse not to try it."

Those are the obvious choices, but every little detail matters, every mundane conversation, and anything you say may be held against you.The deed is a minimalistic reverse murder mistery, and quite frankly one of the most genius use I have seen made out of RPG maker.A playthrough lasts about 10 minutes, but you probably won't succeed at first, and can get a lot more entertainment from unlocking all the endings. At the price tag of under a dollar, it's totally worth every penny.The writing is good and the characters are amazingly well fleshed out for a short game.Like a LA Noire interrogation, but in reverseThere aren't many games out there which let you play from this unique perspective, that of a suspected murderer trying to lie your way out of jail....apart from the deed 2 of course, which uses the same formula but with more polish and more content. Both games offer a unique perspective and refreshing gameplay experience; you can get the bundle with your eyes closed."

The atmosphere is there, the artwork is well-crafted, and exploring the various options for how to murder your sister and frame it on someone else, or make it come across as a suicide, is thrilling in a slightly 'creepy' way. You need to 'set up the pieces' correctly not only to get away with the deed, but to divert attention from yourself so that your father still leaves his inheritance to you. Not only your choice of murder weapon, but also who you talk to, and the directions the conversations go, are important, as a police detective will scrutinise your actions after your sister's death.The Deed is a short game, but what it delivers is solid. It also has some replayability value from the sheer number of possible actions throughout the game."

,Recommended,420740,19262681,"Posted: 25 November, 2015",all,Ambrosius,"Like many others, I found this game interesting, as well as unique. The prospect of the game is how and who do you have your sister killed and framed for, as titled,–""The Deed""–it's quite dark, bringing in the question to not only the main character, but you. Why? Was it worth it at the end?There are multiple ways in killing your sister, and a couple of people you can frame. The way you plant false evidence, the weapons you choose, and where you were. Honestly however, the game is quite short, with it only lasting around 10-15 minutes. But with the variety of ways to kill your sister and who to frame, I would say you would be able to squeeze out at most 2 hours. There is minimal dialogue because of this, so you don't really know much about the character and his ""life away from his family"" other than that they are dysfunctional and your sister is ""mentally insane"" (but for it's length it's a lot) which makes it straightfoward; find someone to frame, find an evidence to plant, find a weapon to use to murder, and run to a place.However! The dialogue is actually quite an interesting feature in the game. What I mean is, depending on how you plan to interact with your family, the butler, and the maid, may or may not bite your butt back during the inspection, which can consequently make you suspicious. Most games, tend to overlook this, which would of made the game more unique to you.Pros:Interesting genre of a gameAtmosphere is fitting and niceMany ways of doing ""The Deed"" resulting in multiple runsDialogue affects outcomeIt reflects on you at the end, was it worth the inheritance?Cons:I have not much to say, other than it being short and maybe a lack of voice acting.All in all, the game is an interesting experience, and for a buck for 2 hours is highly worth it.Edit: Added a gameplay video belowhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=562554689"

The choices you make when conversing with the other characters affect the questioning you receive toward the end of the game.Your choice of item to plant and weapon to use also affect the game, from framing another to the possibility of suicide or getting caught yourself.Navigating around the house can be confusing at first.  I was not aware that the doors in a room below your character will open and he will step through them (going south) if you click on them.  Perhaps an arrow pointing downward above those doors would help first time players understand how to get into those rooms.This game does have multiple endings.  It can be confusing which is the ""right"" ending.  I'm guessing there really is no ""right"" ending, just play the game and complete everything right to get the ending you're hoping for.I recommend this game if you're looking for something quick and simple to play.

That said it fits so well that I cant really fault the developer for using it in the first place. There are no graphics options which is a shame because not even pressing ALT + ENTER could get it to go fullscreen for me meaning I had to play it in a small window the whole time which would have taken me out of the experience if the game wasn't so engaging.

This game did none of those things!While you could argue that it sports the same graphics as every RPG maker game (indeed it does) I've always thought that art style was ok when working in a dark setting.It does have some humor but it's not random humor or memes like in a lot of other similar games. The humor comes from the laughable dialogue choices and actions that, if used correctly, can be used to your benefit. That's right, you can be a total♥♥♥♥♥♥and still win the game if you play your cards right.Instead of trying to shoe horn in combat or inventory management it opts to nearly completly remove those features to be a game that's a lot less like a typical RPG and more like an adventure game with more than one ending. Each play through is about 30 minutes max which really encourages you to play through the game multiple times to experiment with different outcomes. This is the only game that I have put forth the effort to get all the acheivements and I had fun getting every single one. That rarely happens with me.OVERALL: Don't be mislead by the RPG Maker tag.

I much better would like to play a RPG Maker game with this kind of cohesion and smart writing than long, pointless series of forgettable battles.The music well matches the mood creators were aiming for but the sound effects are pretty bad and could be easily replaced even with public domain files. The graphic is overall decent but the characters walk sort of alienish, what unfortunattely is a usual animation of this RPG Maker source files. It feels cheap... But for a 0.69 euro game it is completely forgivable.Some retrospections and descriptions are pretty interesting and I think it's good the game doesn't try to spell obvious messages like ""don't kill, killing is bad"" or something. I liked the suggestions that the actual deed is completely unnecesary and pointless - it's not a story about rightful vengeance, and more about a grown-up person who is blinded by his own immaturity and traumas.Basically it's a small game that doesn't offer anything it wouldn't need and is a great way to spend 1-2 hours with some dark, twisted mystery adventure."

You have to pick up two items, one evidence item and one weapon. Or, you could plant two evidence items and use your bare hands to kill her.Was the game worth the $0.60? YES. Would you say it is worth more? Yes, but not much due to its length. However, you can play it over and over again and as you do, you realize that the story behind the game is actually quite detailed. It's amazing how the creators of this game managed to portray every character's personality so well in the short amount of time the game takes to play.An interesting thing in this game is the fact that you get to see some flashbacks from your past when you look at/interact with certain items, such as the mirror in the hallway and the chair in your parents' room. It's a nice touch and it really helps you get a sense of what the main character went through as a child and why he has his mind set on killing his sister.And on to the best part: the weapons! Although this game takes place inside a house and runs a very short time, there are a great deal of weapons and things to choose from, such as but not limited to, a pool cue, a broom handle, a broken mirror, a shotgun and even a fencing sword! The variety in this game is phenominal and you can tell just by looking at it how much love and effort went into creating it - the atmosphere, the characters and everything.Overall, if I was to give this game a rating out of 10, 1 being terrible and 10 being absolutely groundbreaking - I'd give this game a 7/10 for being a good, simple, and creative way to spend 20 minutes and $0.60.

The content obviusly isn't immense but for some fun between others game or when for life reasons the play time isn't enough this game is simply perfect. Also the idea behind the game it's quite interesting and rarely done in games this way."
,Recommended,420740,32704547,Posted: 23 June,all,Krabs,"I picked this game up cheap, in a Humble Bundle or something. It's about $1 full price, and it goes on sale a lot.What is this game? It is a very simple murder simulator. You are a mean, nasty horrible person who heard his sister would be inheriting the family fortune, so you are coming to murder her. The game part of it comes in the fact that you can frame other people in the house for the murder, and you can choose other weapons. But you will murder your sister.A play through takes about 8 minutes, which encourages you to choose different weapons, and dialogue options to try to frame other people. There are three endings(a) don't get caught, but do inherit, (b) don't get caught, but don't inherit, and (c) get caught.There are achievements for each person you can frame, and each weapon you can use. You could achievement farm the game with a guide in just an hour or two, or you could spend awhile trying to figure it out all by yourself.The game is so short and so cheap , it is hard to be hate on the game. In fact, if you sell the card drops, it's probably less than $.50.  But there are very few likeable characters in the game (the butler and maid are ok, but otherwise every character is a terrible person), and I found it hard to care about the outcome. Really, I found achievement farming - how do I frame the maid so I get the achievement? Did that, now how do I frame the butler so I get the achievement? - to be the only reason to play the game."

And it was worth every penny, for certain.I've played far more expensive games that didn't make me feel half of what this one does.  It's a reverse murder-mystery, where you are trying to murder someone (who richly deserves it) and frame someone else.The people who review and say ""I tried all the combinations"" is not likely telling the truth, because there are a lot more combinations than it at first appears.  (There are a number of places you can plant evidence---including to be deliberately found on your person.)Memorable. Small. Makes you feel. I'd buy this guy's next one, if he made something similar.  It's small, but well-made."

Dont read anything about the game in case of spoilers, start and think before every action you do and think twice before you say anything. Because all of them will be used against you.Main story can be finished in a quite short time. but you can play more to see alternative endings like me."

,Recommended,420740,33127886,Posted: 2 July,all,hikari49,Interesting short game until you get the game mechanics and after that is just to get all the achievements which requires a bit of thinking for certain people you want to frame a murder. Pretty nice to spend two hours away from reality.
76561198031146781,Recommended,420740,33108616,Posted: 1 July,all,Aureal,"Fairly small but creative game, even given the limited options available. Fairly quick and easy to get 100% achievements, even if the butler is oddly hard to frame. Shouldn't the butler be the obvious culprit? :PProbably spent about 5-6 hours getting all 17 achievements, my playtime on record is higher due to leaving it on overnight for card drops before actually playing it. There's a few oddities that break the immersion a bit, like how nobody in the last act pays any attention to you at all as you walk around to plant evidence even though knowing you were wandering around like that would be pretty incriminating, and it's annoyingly easy to accidentally click a wrong dialogue option as you try to zoom through the talk that you've seen half a dozen times already. But for a game that's under $1, how much do you expect?"

The Deed might not be the longest game, but it is one of the few games I have replayed, and every playthrough adds more to the surprisingly great story. And if You are going for achievements you can skip most of the stuff you have already seen. Also the music is just fantastic, especially when you are doing the deed.SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The Deed might have somewhere around ten endings, but honestly it has three. They were all great tho when you saw them the first time, but it is extremely dissapointing to see that what You do does not matter that much. But at least if you managed to fool the cops, you get to see the real ending."

I got this game on sale under a pound, and I soon found out why. It's a very small game, short, but it makes good use of its time. A few different endings, some nice strategy aspects, and interesting combinations. I wouldn't call this a bad game, but I played three 10 minute games of it and haven't really been compelled to return to it, which says that it isn't a great game either.I usually follow the system of a game is worth its price if I get an hour of fun gameplay for every pound spent on the game. I got it for just over half a pound, so I'd say it was, but I could play a bit more. Pretty decent game, but get it on sale."

It makes the most of its graphical style to create an appropriate atmosphere, although it's sometimes let down by its writing with some words and phrases feeling out of place. However for less than a pound, it's well worth taking a look."
,Recommended,420740,34346237,Posted: 19 August,all,StrangerDanger,"The only reason I would recommend this is on price and concept.As other reviews stated, after the first playthrough or two it loses any intrigue and, unless you're an achievement hunter, is never to be touched again. The first playthrough will be to figure out the story, the second will be to try and get an ending you're curious about, and the third will be to see whats the weirdest way you can kill your sister, but they never get that weird because your options are extremely limited.What did this game teach me? Murder always leads to dark depression and nightmares. Not at all what I expected."

,Recommended,420740,35396591,Posted: 1 October,all,Ichigo,"It's...good.  It is!  For the price, it's definitely worth it.  You attempt to kill the sister that has made your life a living hell since childhood, and I'm not just talking stolen cookies, then frame literally anyone else in the house for it, my personal favorite being the dad, but...the murder was unjustified.  You're not playing a psychotic megalomaniac, you're playing a grown man who has finally made his way into the world, away from his abusive family (mother, father, and sister!), and is only coming back at this point because he heard he was being written out of his father's will in place of his mentally ill sister.  The motive, rather than revenge, which would make me feel somewhat satisfied, is greed.Plotting murder is great fun, but motive is everything.  This wasn't as fun to me as it could've been.  My recommendation?  Get this for a buck, then get The Deed: Dynasty, or get them together as a package deal.  That has 3 Deed games in one, and all three have stronger motives than this snot-nosed brat, so it's infinitely more satisfying.  There's more options and trials, as well, making things more interesting."
