And this is one of those games that requires precise timing of controls.  So that's kind of a big deal.The tougher levels just give you more obstacles and less time to react to them, and a single mistake means restarting the level.  So it feels less like skillful maneuvering and more like memorizing which buttons to press at which time.  More frustrating than fun, IMO.It's also really short, but that's understandable at this price point."

""Only"", because this is a very fast game, where levels should be finished in under 10 seconds sometimes. So 50 minutes is a looong time for playing this game and feels like 5 hours or so.Whether you are looking for a few minutes of distraction or want to try a speedrun after mastering all levels forth and back, this game is well worth its small price.Pro:- Each level is more or less easy to win, but hard to nearly impossible to master- I like the school grade measuring system for level success. Makes you want to try it ""only one more time"" ;-)- the retro-modern, cathode-ray tube, 8-Bit, pseudo-3D graphics- Support! The game creator/programmer was able to help me with a specific technical issue within hours. Double plus LIKE!Neutral:- the storyline. Not every game must have one. This one fits into the overall game look and feel, but I would not have missed it if it did not have one.Cons:- when playing for a while, the music may get a bit monotonous. This is my personal experience, which may not be applicable to other players.[removed]Cons: - possible issues with screen resolution in full screen mode. Unity does not remember the set screen resolution. This is a Unity platform specific flaw on some systems (like mine, unfortunately) for which the programmer cannot be blamed for. Windowed mode works fine, so this is no real issue.[Edit Mar 24th: solved. The game creator reactivated the Unity config screen which allows to set fullscreen in the correct resolution. Again: double plus LIKE!]"

I thought this game would be really fun but to be honest the controls with a mouse/keyboard are horrible. I have yet to try this with a controller if compatible and might if I remember in the near future. If I do, I will be sure to update my review with what I think about that aswell."
,Recommended,420850,25252057,"Posted: 30 August, 2016",all,Mr.Angry,"The concept of Cosmic Leap seems pretty simple at first, all you have to do it jump around a bunch of planets and make your way towards your getaway spaceship while encountering several obsacles and enemies. I would not recommend this game for people who lack patience as you will end up punching the table many times thanks to unresponsive controls. Over time I somewhat got used to them but they are very difficult to master. This game poses a real challenge if you decide to complete both objectives (finish a level in time and collect all the coins within). There are also a couple of bugs where the game freezes upon opening Steam Overlay and when you fiddle with the screen resolution. On the other hand, Cosmic Leap has impressive visuals and undisturbing but yet good soundtrack. Also, try and find a steam coupon for this game if you can. 7/10"

There is a plot so bad that the game would be better off without one, glitchy gameplay, finnicky movement and controls, and the ending is literally the game telling you to go back and do all the levels that were presented as optional in the beginning just so you can get 1 extra character. Yeah, normally I wouldn't have spoiled that, but you should know the junk you are getting into before you play this."

Make it ONE direction only for the controls, regardless the point you are on the planet."

Cosmic Leap is in incredibly fun game is which you jump from planet to planet trying to reach your rocket-ship. The game (haven't beaten it yet) I imagine will get a bit harder as the ways to jump from planet to planet should continue to get more complex. The puzzles of jumping to planet to planet are challenging but not to the point of being unfair, and the soundtrack is incredible. The game also gives you a wide variety of characters (40 of them) to unlock as well as 9 different rocket ships. It works great with a controller and has a very fun retro feel and style to it. If you're looking for a fun, colorful, slightly challenging game to play than this one is for you! Plus, how can beat a price of $2? 10/10 looking forward to playing much more!For those looking for gameplay before buying it, you can find my playthrough (1080p, 60 FPS) of the first couple levels here.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeGEkw00YN0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k1Xrrnp24Uhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWWZlNCz-rkEDIT: It's to bad the majority of you don't find my view helpful but I really do think this is a game worth playing. And no, I'm not a dev for this game in case you think my review is a bit over exaggerated. However when I see a game I think deserves attention I try to sell it as hard as I can. If you thought I oversold then I apologize but I call how I see it, and I see a great game here."
