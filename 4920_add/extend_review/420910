Developers promised in june 2016 major updates during 2 weeks time. It's September now and no updates. Do not waste your money on this until this updating issue is fixed.

I accuse players that have given it a negative review of overlooking the fact that it's not only early access, but also that itjustcame out. I played it for about an hour so far and if you're into Simulation / Management games, I'd definetly recommend buying it.8/10"

By this i mean, the game is too boring. It needs more going on but thats something for the developers. As my experience has been negative, i will have to give it a thumbs down but should the developers improve the game to a point were i enjoy playing then i will gladly change my mind. Sorry guys, this game doesn't do it for me."

Can't wait until the accesories update is reliesed!"

But with some more features, content, and UI fixes I can see this game being quite successful!I'll be publishing a review later down the line once this game has been finished, but I like what I see and I'll be following its progress! You should too!"

Super stoked it got on Steam so quickly!My only complaint is it just needs a little optimizing, runs great on my new mac but I tried it out on an older one and it was a little slow, still playable though.Looking forward to franchises!"

76561198017662077,Not Recommended,420910,20261533,"Posted: 3 January, 2016",all,McMannis,Do not buy this game. Knowing the game is in alpha I expect there to be issues .  What I got was a menu with no real game at all.  When you click new game you get a menu that explains the developers goals but no way to click through to start a game.  These menus take about a minute to scroll through each one as is freezes on every single window.  I worked with the game for about 5 minutes and still was unable to figure out how to start the game.  during this time I had to cntl alt del the game 3 times.  I have the hardware to run any game out there.  As far as I am concerned this was nothing short of theft.
