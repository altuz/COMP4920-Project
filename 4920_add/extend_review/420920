Windowing to be able to use the mouse is one, while occasional crashes, especially after you took 20 minutes making a character, can be quite annoying.The game does hold promise as an idea; I really do love the character creator and the depth you can go with it, though I'm sure it ends up in cookie cutter designs eventually, there would be quite a few winning combinations to be sure. The maze layout randomness is nice, and so is the choice of 1-4 characters and permadeath if you're into that. But I seem to spend more time making characters than playing the Labyrinth, but this might be a personal thing.I'd say buy at your own risk, it might be right up your alley, or it may fall flat. I'd like to see the game tinkered with some more, personally. But there's a huge amount of promise."

It has permadeath if you want it, but you can also start a non-permadeath game and save any time. I wish all roguelikes had this option. I'd buy a lot more of them.The UI is rather awkward, and the graphics very simple, but it has a ton of skills and even has multiplayer, which can be used to create a party to play by yourself.My only real complaint is that hunger and thirst are a little too intrusive.  It feels like every minute or two I need to eat or drink. And on my current game (level 6) I'm completely out of food and ""very hungry"". This could be a virtual permadeath situation if I can't find food soon.It's easily worth the five bucks."

Try it - it is only $5 and well worth the price if you like this type of game."
,Recommended,420920,19397952,"Posted: 30 November, 2015",all,Pythos,A very deep character customization sets you up for extreme replayability in a hardcore roguelike. Play it on full-screen and you are good-to-go. If you have set it on stretched window use the hotkeys to navigate to the video settings (press alt to see hotkeys in the menu)You can also change the settings in the settings.txt in the game folder. Go to the game properties in steam -> local files -> browse local files -> settings.txt

Want to be hand to hand combat only warrior? Sword and shield, or two handed axe? Take your pick. How about a crack shot bow wielder? A sneaky back stabbing assassin? Or a Fire Mage?  Water? Air, Earth, Death, Blood, Acrane, White, Druid, Death, Witch, Warlock, Paladin, Summoner….The variations are vast, and give the game a lot of replay value. And it only cost me £3 :)The game play itself does appear to be very basic at first [just walking through narrow corridors until you meet a creature, with no AI to speak of. But the game does open up with new features introduced after the first few levels. And there is surprising depth here.And MULTIPLAYER! Yes, I have not tried this, but I can imagine it being great fun with a friend or two.I did not notice any bugs or experience any issues with the game at all. Perhaps those have been ironed out by now.Admittedly, the graphics and interface are very basic [but functional]. I would love to be able to install some better tile sets, I think the game would really benefit from that. You can install some custom dungeons too. The game has a lot of potential if modders decide to add things.All in all, well worth the price."

Lots of viable character builds (This game shames nearly every other rpg in this aspect actually), and the random levels ensure no two playthroughs are the same. The non-extended version is available free from the developer's site, but I think the game is easily worth $5.Note: the game doesn't play well with certain desktop resolutions. I originally tried to play with my desktop resolution set at 4k, and the fonts didnt scale correctly. Switched to 1080p and everything was fine. Minor quibble."

The avatars that you can pick from are still cute so its not too serious. Another reviewer said the artwork wasn't consistent and that's so true. It's like a hodge podge. The detailed character creation is one of the game's high points. The game is fun playing with another person. Playing with another person reminded me of playing a speedier version of the classic Dungeons and Dragons board game because it's turn based. Worrying about food and water makes the game tough. There's even an option for being a vegetarian (if you choose this character 'quirk' in the character creation). I also like the little details in the graphics too such as 'arcane arrow' animated as a purple bolt. But it's true that it's kind of buggy. Still worth the 5 bucks.
,Recommended,420920,33277626,Posted: 5 July,all,Alessondria,"At the end of the Summer Sale I had a few dollars left so I picked through the $5 ones. I rarely even look at mixed review games but glad I did! The sale price of $2 put me off because I'm cheap and not typically into these rouge-likes but the presentation actually caught my eye. Reminded me of classic old games like the Exile series and the DOS game days.I then learned you can download the standard edition for free at their website so I played a game and I really like it. ToME is one of the few others that feel like this game in some core ways. Its very true to NEShack and Rogue. I find the art style nice and the interface welcoming. I like its not a very involved game and seriously has a casual feel to it. Character creation is outstanding! This is Daggerfall level CC cool easily, folks. Build pretty much any character you wish.Traps, bolders, poisonous monsters, fishing, merchants, skill books, alchemy, crafting (with perk), magic wands, scrolls, potions, crap tons of spells, secret doors... there's a lot packed into this game and its clearly well thought out. I've only played 2 games but man I really like this.Very old game though. If you're not old or into classic looking game you will instantly dislike this. There's also some issues with the mouse like dragging and dropping skills to the quickbar. Its unfortunate and super frustering to the point I will complain on the forums.Bottom line you can totally tell this was a late 90s project that started with a few friends that made it in their spare time, improved it over the years and eventually said 'hey lets put this on steam to make a few extra dollars!' And I am completely happy they did. Charming game. Difficult. Not super polished. Overall I would recomend it to people who enjoy these types of games and old school dungeon crawlers. I give this cool find a 4 outta 5!"

,Recommended,420920,19907158,"Posted: 24 December, 2015",all,pango,"The presentation in this game is awful: the graphics are all different styles and often have nasty looking borders round them. It gives the appearence of a game from the early 90s. There's low res pictures with visible jpg artifacts in them and the music is repetitive as heck.Having said that the game itself seems like it could be a good one: there's certainly a lot of scope for customizing your character at the start and there's a lot of spells in the game.If you wonder why you can only see the square you're in when you start, I think it's dark: you need to cast a spell of light of some kind (there's more than one).Will write more after having played more."

And make me uncomfortable besides.The thing that drew me to this game was the screencap of the equipment/inventory screen. I love stuff like that. If the whole game had had that aesthetic... well I still wouldn't of liked it but at least it would've been charming."

I remember being part of the community for the first versions of this game *ages* ago, and personally interacted with the developer quite a bit. He took several of my suggestions and really ran with them.What I'm saying is that the bad parts are probably my 15-year old self's fault."

There's not much left at that point.Note: I've spent a lot of time on this game since the free version has been around for quite a while now."
