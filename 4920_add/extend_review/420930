When I sit and think about this game, what CHKN has above all else is just that: personality. Where other games have caught my craving to design and construct a world made of blocks, none have quite captured the life and the heart, that can be found in CHKN's lifeblocks. CHKN embraces building a connection when building yourself a personal companion, and this sort of unique animation that comes out of such customized creatures is what keeps the game interesting and evolving."

You would most likely enjoy this game if you enjoyed any of the following-Minecraft-Spore-ARK: Survival Evolved-Or any other survival gameThis game is filled with tons of opritunities! You will be able to do things all the time! Their are some downsides to this game, but most of those are only glitches. I must say this game is filled with glitches, but it is only in early access, and from what I have seen developers are working on this game non-stop.Speaking of developers, I have seen myself how fast devs respond to you on the forums. I made a post on the forums about Troughs, and in under 16 hours a dev had responded to me telling me about the problem and if they will change it in the future.Here are my final ratings for this game:GAMEPLAY 8/10-The game has a very unique gameplay. One like I had never seen before. It has tons of hours of fun in the game!PLAY TIME 7/10-Currently the game has a lot to do, but just not enough if you are like me and play thousands of hours on games, BUT this will not stay for long. They add new stuff almost every week! You are sure to be able to get a lot out of this game, especially when it fully comes out!GLITCHES AND BUGS 3/10-The game has many different bugs and many different glitches in it, but it is still in early access.UPDATES 10/10-The devs work on this game non-stop. They bring so many new updates ranging from bug fixes to new creatures! It is absolutely outrageous.OVERALL 8/10-The game has its downs, but the game is mostly just pure fun! You can play for hours alone or with friends! This game is a must have game in my opinion. If you rage because of bugs I would hold off until the game is fully realeased, but for the rest of you I would get it now.Recomenneded!"
,Recommended,420930,32957696,Posted: 28 June,all,TheyCallMeGunny,"This game is witty fun.-The exploration is brief, but HIGHLY rewarding on a deep, emotional level. The wonder of the unkown is strong here.-The creatures are downright silly, in a good way. I look up at my wall to see a pair of eyeballs just staring at me over the wallon stalks. It's an herbivore I recognize, so I'm not concerned.. Of course, I had dropped a body part in my base and so what I didn't realize was that featherhose was about to eat my wall, eat the body part (only to spit it back up) and throw a 300hp temper tantrum on me for the terrible food he stole that he didn't even like... Then finally, after repeated deaths at his hoof, he decides to pick up my wall, and run off with it.. Hilarious. And I am still seeking revenge to this day.-The playtime is short. It has room for expandability, but at it's given state I don't expect to see it anytime soon. Although I do expect to see it at some point. It's a gaem best played with friends when you just want to have fun, and aren't necessarily expecting to get anything specific done."

And in my opinion, 90% of games like that are awesome.The best way I can desribe CHKN is the original Spore title mixed with either Minecraft or ARK. You are put on a large island full of wacky creatures, and you need to survive. What makes it fun is you can make your own creatures from body parts of dead creatures or eggs. And believe me, you can make anything. A chicken with arms that have crab mouthes for hands? Go ahead! A tarantula with octopus tentacles? Go ahead! Your imagination is your only limit. If you liked Spore and you like Minecraft, you should definitely give CHKN a spin!"

No more striking, more animal parts, caves coming soon, better loop audio for effects, stamina, sprinting? All totally amazing. the one game I can truly say that they devs are indeed listening. Talk about fast development. Good job on the game guys! Hugs to you all and thx for the hard effort and dedication towards this project. I'm sure plenty of people are really excited. I know I am. :DDCheers!!My recommendation:I have to say I posted many suggestions and so did many other people. The game has a dedicated team. This is a family orientated game. Imagine a santbox game where you can truly be your own version of franskenstein. No other game has taken it this far before. I totally recommend it even in it's current stage. Well worth the money spent. If anything it's too cheap for what you get already. You never have a feeling of being ripped off. Check out the news sections in community hub to see all the fixed and additions they add so frequently. Imagine the possibilities with a game like this. TOo many games fit into the block style genre but not many that stick out as unique as this one with the ability to make your own creations and bring them to life when you make a new creature. Imagine a floating or flying tutle or blimp animal that can hold your home? This game keeps evolving. I suggest it for families as well. The game looks amazing and handles well. The devs work hard and they listen. Truly an amazing experience. And with so much more to come! Stay tuned as it developes further! :DD"

I thought it was a bit easy at first until I got further into the jungle. There are some crazy creatures on this game! I even built one that immediately turned on me and killed me. Sad face. Your builds do get destroyed so that adds challenge, and in order to build stuff, you need a tamed animal to power the workshop. I'm hooked and am looking forward to creating more monstrosities."

Now, my computer is already pretty low-end craptastic so I didn't really expect to be able to play at all. It's a really good game depite me having to play on fugly settings (not that it matters because these animals are all equally scary even with graphics all the way up). I do though have a few issues.Yes, it's in early access. Yes, its probably not going to as cleaned up as a fully fledged games but having played for a while I've noticed just a few bugs... ok, a lot of bugs.The most recent one being that I had been running around for a while, I had built my house (with the wood) I had set up just a nice little corner for me to live in with my abominations who always turn on me. I made a bunch of stuff, a slingshot I wanted to test out and a bunch of food. After that I galloped away into the sunset to see how many animals I can try to kill before I come to the realisation that no matter what weapon I have I will always be at the bottom of the food chain. Ultimately, I died. Weirdly though when I went to respawn in the bed the bed and the house and any structures I had built were just gone. There were little bits of fencing and my abomination who had hatched another abomination and their nest was still there. So that was weird.I'm not sure if this is intentional but the animals I make and/or tame will only stay tamed if they arent attacked or try to attack something. Sometimes I can keep them tamed after they've ran off but a good bit of the time they just run off like ""YOU'VE BETRAYED ME! WE ARENT FRIENDS ANYMORE!"" and I stand there holding unicorn horns and cow bodies like ""ok"". All seriousness though this is really annoying and since my pc is craptastic, building animals is so time consuming for me.Speaking of making animals! I'll be in the middle of building one and the bar thing will be pretty low and as I'm adding parts they just pop off. Sometimes i can just dismantle and rebuild the entire thing and it will build then but sometimes I do it and rather than popping off the tail it starts rejecting mouths, ears, eyes, body blocks, ect. I honestly have no idea why this would even be happening.Honestly, I got my PC refurbished and it might be haunted because games are almost always like this.I will, despite bugs, keep playing and looking forward to updates because this is the only game out of many I've been able to play that I've wanted to play.Keep up the good work, proud of you.

The game itself is very pretty and I find it very calming making my little seaside animal sanctuary!The only downside to the game I have found so far is that it can be a bit laggy while recording, and I currently find the house building a little bit fiddly (mainly due to the lag). I put this mostly down to the fact that the game is in early access and I firmly believe that this will get ironed out with time.On the subject of the devs, they are very active in updating the game, with a new patch out just over a week ago that added a whole load of new animal types and caves to the terrain.

I would personally recomend it to anybody who enjoys games like Minecraft, SPORE, and just enjoy the Sandbox Survival Genre and want a breath of fresh air from the many, many copy past sanbox games out there.The Game: The thing that makes CHKN such a fun game is the fact that it's ""creature buulding"" aspect of this game. It really is a handsome feauture when you're a guy like me who just wants to build some wonderus (or sometimes goofy) looking beasts and plants.The Atmosphere: It's very childlike in nature. Beautiful looking little island filled with goofy species of monsters and critters. It's just fun to explore the place after a new update and see what waky beasts the devs (who are  super-nice) cook up in the lab.  Speaking of which...Devs and Players: This might be the nicest team of devs I've ever seen. They listen to the fans ideas and fix up those nast bugs, they fun, interactive and really sweet! I love watching their streams, go Cactus Man!Graphics & Asthetics: This game looks really nice. I have so much fun even if I'm on the same world, agian, agian, and agian. Now that is something rare out of me cuase I like new worlds and stuff. It's mostly beacuse of the fancy look the world has, the beast that reside their a fun and cool to look at. Sometimes I'll just make worlds just to look at the weird lifefomrs the reside there.Others: Whule this game might be the most beautiful ""ugly duckling"" (see what I did there) I've ever seen. It tends to be rather buggy with a crashy multiplayer (which I don't mind cuase I did not get this for multiplayer, I got it to build my Chicken-Octo-phanto-Suarus). But besides that it's got the blocky charm of Minecraft and the wonderus natsolgia of games like SPORE, Zoo Tycoon 2, and Venture Africa (games I grew up on) I'd say CHKN is goanna be a smash hit, especallly with it's one-of-a-kind crearure designer.BTW (to the devs) I think this game would make an awesome ecosystem/evolution simulation game.

Esc goes to the options screen, but all continues to happen in the background- Map feature- Mining/Digging- Armor Crafting- A larger selection of weapons (I know that the creature you build can take the brunt of the combat, but a bit more ability to defend yourself wouldn't hurt this)- A few more options in house building: alternate construction materials, some static defenses (spikes, etc.), and some eye candy never hurtUnderstand: I know this is not 7 Days to Die. It's 7 Days to CHKN.Did I just use CHKN as a verb? Maybe.Maybe.A few clicks of a few screenshots or a quick view of of a youtube clip will tell you what you probably already suspect and what many beautiful and brilliant gamers have already indicated: Minecraft and Spore had a baby. An adorable, engaging baby with a mean, unforgiveable streak. Let that sentence settle for a bit, I'll wait over here.Part survival game, part God game, part gotta-catch-em-all game, CHKN drops you on a beach surrounded by fruit. Near you are a couple eggs that you can either leave alone (for some reason), or crack open and scoop up (what looks like) a toppled bucket of Mr. Potato Head: Kentucky Fried Chicken Edition parts. With any of these in hand, point it at the sky, click, and assemble your first friend/pet/protector.Feed it melons or squash, just like any new chicken beast. And seek others. Others to subvert, assemble, eat, or any of the above in any order you like. The parts I have thusfar discovered are (in no order of discovery or assembly): Pigs, llamas, dragons, cows, beetles, tarantulas (SCREAMLOL), sheep, giraffes, elephants, goats, alligators, cranky hooded jerks with dart guns and two-legged robo-lizards, and, of course, chickens.There are several harvestable resources - nothing surprising or new there. Though, of course, there really need not be. The craftable side of things is simple and fun, though it is the lesser part of the game, or at least what I have seen so far seems to indicate this. Again, the standard constructs of stone, wood, and iron apply, but I think this may be intentional as it is more fun to build a chicken-legged, goat-lipped, elephant-tusked beetle-sheep than a porch....I re-read the above and it seems a bit unfair. Let me rephrase: the house/tool/weapon crafting side of things is simpler than the beast-building aspect, but it is not lacking at all. There.I have only found three types of non-beast made food: Melons, squash, and apples. The first two you can find in the wild and then plant their seeds in the ground with a hoe, the other drops from apple trees, (from which you can harvest seeds and plant in the ground with a hoe). All of these you can feed to herbivores to keep them fat and happy. This seems minimal, but it does not truly detract from the game.I think that will do for now. Come, chicken-legged, goat-lipped, elephant-tusked beetle-sheep. We have much to do."

Also sometimes everything starts walking in circles and apparently your charecter is frozen, But you dont know untill your friend says, ""Why aren't you moving"" Because you are able to move on your screen.- The lag is insanity, I put up with lag in a lot of games, but this lag is just unbareble, the frames drop really low, And the weird part is is that i have 8 GB ram and this game only requires 4 GB ramConclusionI give this game 9/10 because everything is great except for the unbareble multiplayer lag/glitches."

It is one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a population of more than 19 billion as of 2011.[1] Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food, consuming both their meat and their eggs.Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in Southeast-, East-,[2] and South Asia, but with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian subcontinent. From India, the domesticated chicken was imported to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the fifth century BC.[3] Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the ""bird that gives birth every day"" having come to Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[4][5][6] Of all avian dinosaurs, the chicken is biologically closest to feathered ancestors eradicated by the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.[7]"

Let me explain below...https://youtu.be/Kp5GJmipxUYCHKN is an amazing concept and it's pretty well executed, though buggy atm.It's fun, it's cute -in that kind of horrific abomination kind of way-, and works decently well in the whole ""create your own creatures"" and survival ways.The bugs hinder it though, and frankly, multiplayer is a fair way from being stable.(Hint: You may want to wait a bit if you mainly plan to play it MP)For example, I loaded a save game and suddenly an entire hillside (including the house I was building) had vanished... suddenly it was bare as a baby's bottom.Supposedly though, that's already been patched, a mere couple of hours after release; and that's part of why I hesitantly recommend the title. There's a lot of potential here, but you can say that about many things on early access. Seeing the devs quickly hop into fixing something and getting it patched so quickly gives me a bit of hope for the game's future.Overall though, given the fun to be had, and the price point for it, I'd say it's worth the money. And if not right now, then in the near future. If you can tolerate ""roughing it"" through the early access bugs, CHKN is a breath of fresh air in the survival genre that's getting all too stale lately."

,Recommended,420930,30503744,Posted: 14 March,all,☠BigBossReaper☠♈,"I really want to recommend this game between Yes and No because the potential and fun is there, but the game is very Laggy when trying to load the backgrounds. Now this is not a deal breaker for me, this is merely something that I am more then positive will be fixed. I can run Witcher 3 on max settings, but this game stutters when rendering distance? Seriously... what the heck! I want to like this game, but in it's current state, I can't. I may not recommend this game, but I strongly recommend that you  BUY this game, because I feel like it is going to turn into some bad A** monster creating survival game in the near future! Help out the devs, by supporting the game, not by buying it and requesting a refund after 5 minutes! It is stupid and repetitive to buy and request a refund for an early access game under $20. How about, don't buy the game until watching some gameplay on youtube or doing some research. Buying a game right off the bat and the refunding is just STUPID.. Now, let me get to the PROS and CONSPros:Creating creatures is awesome!!Having to actually care for your creatures and build with them is awesome!Crafting recipes!! There are a bunch and you actually have to make workbenches to get more recipesA huge variety of creatures, each with actual equippable parts! (You kill a creature, and use it's parts to make your own creatures!) ""This is the premise of the game""The game is cute and funnyCons:LagStutteringBugsNot enough explanation of how to play the gameThe game has many problems, but really, what game in EA doesn't? My final verdict for this game is a 5/10!The game is fun in it's current state and if you can get past the Stuttering and Lag, then you will enjoy yourself alot! Buy the game, help out the developers.This review is a mix of personal and Youtubers experience"

Like honestly, it was fun for a while. But it glitches and it's broken. Connecting is a nightmare, it rarely actually connects me and crashes in the process while I'm trying to play with my friend, even if it's on a LAN network. Then, once I'm finally in, I am constantly taking damage. Constantly. It's like, I join, not taking damage, my game crashes while I'm making  a monster, and then when I join back I'm constantly taking damage. I also can't see my friends building blocks.I'm currently trying a re-install, I'll keep you updated."

Needs tons of play time to handle controls and lots of devotion that will limit your ability to play other games. Dont play if your a casual gamer. Completionists would enjoy.However, I am a more devoted console player by choice. Take that in mind when considering my review of the game as a whole. It still is a great concept and as long as the Devs are devoted then this game will go far."

,Recommended,420930,22872297,"Posted: 8 May, 2016",all,loogi,"CHKN has a lot of potential. Right now, there's not much of an objective besides creating the wackiest creature possible (Octodogtula?) There's not much in the way of progression in the adventure mode, basically just punching chickens to make a bigger chicken, until it can kill a larger creature, like a giraffe. I've got two main gripes with the game, which are the controls, and the noises. The controls feel clunky and unresponsive at times, and your creature often pushes you around trying to follow you. As someone who is easily irritated by eating sounds, I usually avoid eating as much as possible, which is a problem because you have to eat constantly. The developers are also very helpful, having spent the time to help me resolve a crashing problem i've been having."

,Recommended,420930,25300656,"Posted: 2 September, 2016",all,Bilbo,The real plus about this game are the creatures - the ability to create any creature you can imagine (using the set parts provided) is what sets it apart from the other building/survival games out there - it has charm and heart in bucket loads - the graphics are great and the development team are wonderful - they do regular twitch streams and they really do go out of their way to keep the users informed as to what they are up to and they are the most accessible development team I have ever known - I know all the team by name and they know who I am too which really gives you a connection to the game and you feel it is a group effort - I would 100% recommend it to anyone. regular updates and so far new content and multiplayer is coming soon. Excellent game - best $15 I have ever spent

Iv reached a point in the game where every time I go out adventuring an I get attacked a friendly creature will run over to protect me an get stuck on top of me. An know matter what i do it ends up killing me whick starts the grind all over again to gather enough stuff to try again.    How ever if there is a way of fixing this I will be changing this review to recommend.
