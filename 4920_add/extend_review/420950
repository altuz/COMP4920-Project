Nor is it that the boobs grow about 5 extra cup sizes due to extra estrogen in such a short amount of time despite cells not being able to grow that fast even if they are cancerous. I seriously don’t mind it.My problem with this games is that as a visual novel the user should have more choice but this game has only two and only one choice effects the ending in any significant way. So little choices basically make this a book and there are so many better books for me to read than this one. If there is going to be so little choice it must have a good story, a good story would have nice no matter what amount of choices were given, or else it is rubbish. Another alternative they could have done was do what hunie pop (which had no story to speak of) did and have mini games if they didn’t want to wreck the story or to keep a user interested. Sure the girls look good but their animation is average seriously there is better art work out there, but I guess I shouldn’t be too hard since this is Silver Cow’s first game and hopefully they learn from this and make a better game next time which is a sequel to this game."

,Recommended,420950,19202056,"Posted: 21 November, 2015",all,ManaAlchemist,"So because I was bored today, I had a look at the steam store, which suggested this game to me. Being that I love big boobs and big boobs getting even bigger, I thought - well why not? As I found the art to look hot enough, even if it's not the greatest.And I have to say that some of the CG art looks a lot better (well at least to me) than what's shown in the screenshots here, but at the same time there are other pieces that look really bad (even worse than the screenshots).Obviously, I bought it, and after only about 1 hour and 30 minutes, i was done with everything in it. As other reviewers have mentioned, the game only has 2 choices where only one has a real effect on the rest of the game. So it's not a ""game"" for anyone expecting a visual novel or a ""game"" pretty much. More like just fanservice for those like me who like fanservice.There's not much to say about the story without ""spoiling"" it, short as it is. But simply said, it's pretty much just short and kinda weak. Though to be honest, it felt more like a ""demo"" rather than a complete game, with that sequel teaser at the end. But still, it wasn't awful, and with the CG images popping up every few minutes, it was at least able to keep me until the end.And the music was actually somewhat nice.In the end, as a game and visual novel, I think I'd say it's bad.But somehow, i kinda liked it anyways. I suppose that's because i found the two girls Kyo and Rose to be likable, and as I mentioned earlier, I myself found the artwork to look appealing.So would I recommend this to everyone? No.But if you're like me, finding the artwork to be appealing, don't really care if it's ""bad"" and simply just don't really expect anything from the ""game"", but still willing to pay like 10€? Barely yes."

But… It isn’t THAT bad? The background songs are really great, I’d buy this game’s soundtrack without hesitation. The art sometimes is nice, other times is weird and not… appealing. They should have kept the quality in all the CGs.Also this game has almost zero interactivity (which isn’t that bad, I like those kind of visual novels too). Characters are plain and there’s no much depth in their personalities. Background images suffer the same thing like the CGs: sometimes they are nicely done, other times are just… meh. The story was a bit more “complex” than I expected for a game of this kind. There’s a few plot holes, but it’s fine.6/10. I gave an extra point because of the soundtrack to be honest. The game could be better, but it’s still fun to play (or “read”, haha :P). Not worth paying the full price, get it when it’s on sale!"

Wasn't sure what I was getting into with this but I'm happy with the purchase. Some of the art is a little off (nothing too bad, but as an artist specializing in 'mature' things I noticed some stuff, mostly easy fixes) and it started out very anime trope-ish, and of course there is fanservice, but it does propose some interesting questions and choices later in the game with a nice twist and multiple endings. Was looking for a good fanservicey visual novel with a bit of story behind it, this didn't disappoint.Overall I'd say it's good, future games could be even better with a few tweaks."

(But, I would have really liked if there HAD been, you know, similar interesting consequences to the time-travelling on Tenshi... Something unique could have been explored there, is what I'm saying.)The quality of the art/pictures is pretty great, except for a few odd cases where the characters appear 'hand-drawn in a much lower quality'.One thing of note though, as several people already mentioned :The *severe* lack of choices, of being able to actually 'DO' anything- be 'involved' in the story. A lack of even simple ''artificial choices'', like being able to decide which girl to go talk to first/in what order you want to go talk to them(like in the beginning)... I seriously doubt this would have been something hard to implement, especially in such a game, yet it would have made a world of difference.So, yeah, a game that is easy to like (especially if you are one of the MANY people with a soft spot/weakness for charming characters), but it really didn't have the weight it definitely could had have, if it had offered more real or artificial choices (and not just *barely* 2, right at the end, which really hurt replayability).(Oh, and one significant inconsistency I found : In the beginning, it's said that Tenshi was at the hospital for about 2weeks, after the house burning/parents' death, to insure he was 'ok' all around, yet he later says to Michelle that his parent died '3 days' ago.)"

While I'm sure that many people scoff at VN's, particularly these kinds, they're also just looking at the cover for the game and making up their opinions from there.I would not call this the best Visual Novel I've ever experienced. It is very abbreviated, it's plot feels very condensed and there's only two choices in the game near the very end. However, this VN has a lot of heart and charm to it, the characters are likable, understandable and charming, it has a decent amount of humor and is aware of itself.When one of the characters, Kyo (The girl with the aqua colored hair) goes out to shop with Kenji (The protagonist) she wears what looks like a black lingerie slip, which is what she usually wears, and I thought to myself, don't tell me you're wearing that outside, and Kenji mimics my thoughts and questions how she can wear it outside as well.It is not just limited to being aware of itself in humor though, it also tries its best to address certain expected aspects of a game like this. While it doesn't do it in a deconstructive way or analyze it too deeply, it does go out of its way to make it so certain cliches are presented as realistically as it can and tries to address certain qualities of other VN's that people groan at. This doesn't mean it doesn't have its fanservice but it's clearly not supposed to just be about the fanservice, I've seen VN's that are, and I can certainly say that the creators of this game were not going for that.I recommend this game to people that want to support the creators. This is apparently their first game and I can see that they have potential to stretch out and get better at making VN's and that they do want to tell an interesting story while also having some goofy or fanservicy moments along the way. Most Visual Novels don't come over to America from across the sea and so I would be very happy to see more companies make them in my own country. But they need support to get to the point where we can get more complex stories and different genres. So please, if you want to see more VN's, give this one a shot, it doesn't cost much and its a pretty relaxed ride through the game."

,Recommended,420950,32121855,Posted: 1 June,all,Rain,"Lowest price on steam was $5.99Time Tenshi is an enjoyable western visual novel heavily influenced by Japanese VNs. The story is pretty interesting with some funny twists. It has an ecchi undertone that is constantly in the background of the story, however nothing really gets serious. It has no nudity but plenty of big titt shots and barely clothed ♥♥♥♥♥ monsters.Story 7/10The story is about a kid who loses his parents in a fire then goes to live with his grandfather that is a scientist that has created a time machine. He hires scores of young ♥♥♥♥♥ monsters to work for him so they can help stabilize history? It’s kind of eh, but this makes for the interesting dynamic of going to many different settings.  The game really does not have an ending so you need to get Time Tenshi 2 to complete it.Art 5/10It is not atrocious like some western VNs I’ve played, but its downfall is the lack of varying character poses and outfits. They reuse the same 10s of character art throughout the game which gets a little too repetitive for my liking. I could look past this if there was some voice acting to further convey emotions of the characters but sadly there is none.Music 7/10Very enjoyable music that has a vapor wave/jazzy sound to it with the tense moments having a dystopian sound, again just wish there was more variation.Mizuki best girl.Michelle a discount Poison and a thot.Rose a titted paladin knight.Kyo a big-titted gamer/crybaby.Takeaway from game: Never trust a thot."

Despite that being in your face at the start, it's really just a side-dish to the time traveling plot. I liked the story, though it had flaws. Some of Chrontek's plan doesn't make any sense and there are moments where the characters lose all sense of logic and I'm left scratching my head over where their intelligence has gone. Still, I enjoyed it overall. The plot carried some some surprising depth to it that one generally wouldn't expect while judging the cover. Questioning morality and putting a choice in your hands that I was genuinely curious to see how both options played out. The characters are cute, silly, and fun, and fit the plot well.While the story is nice, imo, there is a lack of choices throughout the game that makes this far more a true ""visual novel"" then say an ""Interactive novel"" you might find elsewhere. However, I've also read some VN's that just provide an illusion of choice, making all of their options but one a simple ""Game over"", thus keeping you on a linear story anyway. At least Time Tenshi drops the pretense and just gives you the two options that matter for your particular story. As this is Silver Cow's first VN, the more linear nature of Time Tenshi is understandable. I personally enjoy more choices and hope to see more branching story arcs in the future as they acquire more resources to evolve their methods. As for Time Tenshi, it gave me a laugh and I look forward to reading the sequel! There is definitely a lot of setup for a continuing story here. I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys a read of silly psudo-science and, of course, a view of heavily endowed anime girls."

,Recommended,420950,19185220,"Posted: 20 November, 2015",all,Lyridia Starwalker,"About as basic as a smutty visual novel gets. The story is fine for the most part, the serious bits are interesting and keep you intrigued, the silly bits are as ridiculous as you would hope, and the sexy bits do their job fine enough. The art looks fine, if a little limited (specifically the characters state all the time how their breasts grow and shrink dramatically to different extents at different times, but since there's only 2 sizes for each character, both huge, it may as well not be in the story), and the music, while basic, usually suits the mood fine enough, although having more variety for the serious moments would do the game well. The game's only MAJOR flaw is a near complete lack of choice. You are only presented with two choices, both very close to the end of the game, and the one doesn't even do anything beyond slightly alter a few lines of dialogue.In terms of less severe issues, one is that throughout the entire game, you are constantly praised for having the self control not to try anything with the girls despite the circumstances. The problem is that A. many of the times they praise you for self control you really had no opportunity to do anything if you wanted to, B. every situation was either so rapey you would have to be a sociopath to think what you did wasn't the only right choice, or so forceful on you that the only reason someone would decline in the situation is from genuine lack of desire, and C. the player has no choice in the matter anyway, so you aren't excercising self control, you're just reading text. It just ends up feeling like nonsense every time the characters bring it up.The other issues come in at the very end, so skip to this paragraph if you care about spoilers. The final part of the game revolves around you having the option to prevent the event that caused you to be involved in the game in the first place, creating a time paradox, and what would happen if a paradox is created. Pretty basic time-travel stuff, but the problem is that rather than your interpherance being what prevents the event, you somehow were always the one who started it, and you go back in time to either cause it or not cause it, which means there's a freaking time paradox anyway! How the developers couldn't see that making it so you go back in time with the option to stop it from happening or letting it continue wasn't the more sensible choice baffles me. If you choose to continue with the status quo, you basically get a non-end where it feels like nothing even happens. If you choose to create the paradox, all the pre-concieved notions of how time travel works (which were flimsy at best to begin with) fall to pieces and next to nothing about the ending makes any sense, teasing that a sequel might explain what the hell just happened. Either way, the ending is less than stellar.Overall, if you've got a thing for breast enlargement, or are looking for a funny softcore hentai to laugh at or take seriously, you can certainly do worse than this game, but it's nothing to write home about. Buy it if it's your thing, youtube it or ignore it if it isn't."

Lame. Great artwork though, I wish there were more of these games with mature characters like these rather than all the pedophelia in other games."

The characters are very likable which is a must for me. The one thing I didn't like was the art was inconsistant and there were a few bad shots or angles. the art itself is pretty good but there are times when the expressions on some images just didn't fit the mood. They only had 1 image large enough where the camera would pan down on its own, they should of had more of those. Overall, I'd give this game a 3/5. If the art was better, it'd get a perfect 5/5."

,Recommended,420950,20465121,"Posted: 11 January, 2016",all,Gamerhell01,At first glance it looked like one of the date like simulator but I figured what the hell right? I was bored and need to pass the time but after sympathising with the main character and getting to know the different girls and events I found myself reading every word and trying to figure out the plot and got into the whole story of it all and wanting to know the outcome of it all seeing as it makes you have some choice in certain parts which like time travelling can affect the outcome of the next scene. Granted art style did tend to very when it came to close ups but I found I ignored it and wanted to know the story more than the attraction they tried to play with and not much player choice was put into the game but i find it that with less choice there seems to be a big outcome which shows with little choice follows a bigger plot and story twist. All in all I enjoyed the game and hope to see part two with the possible outcomes i've tried to play at it.

SILVER COW STUDIOS let me tell you BRAVO BRAVISSIMO.I'm really interested about next chapter even if i figured out yet what and who is the shadows....By the way if you wonder about the value of this game....well it worth his price (well honestly half of it the game don't make you do much choice it's basically a fairytale more than a game)...good looking girls time travel with strange effects paradox in your hands....and a cliffhanger"
,Recommended,420950,28911731,Posted: 1 January,all,Sensei-tional,"First off: SPOILERS. SPOILERS. SPOILERS. Carry on.Also, since this is something I always want to know when buying a visual novel, yes, there are choices in this, BUT, there are only two (if I remember right), but they're proportionately big decisions that warrant their scarcity. Before you write it off though, the second game (and it's special edition) has choices out the butt, so I still say you should buy this as more of an appetizer to enjoy before the main dish of the second game.One other-other thing. They explain why their boobs get big. Yeah, I was not expecting that at all, but it's actually fascinating as f*ck that they didn't just write it off as ""Time stuff"", they brought up actual, real-life biology and body chemistry and scientific junk. Props to the writers.I'm going to be honest with you. I'm not so prudent or ashamed that I won't say the reason I originally bought this game was because, y'know, boobs. I'm a guy, so sue me. What I didn't expect, and what i'm sure you wouldn't have expected either, was the fact that this game actually had a LOT, and I mean a LOT of thought put into it. Sure the first thing that drew me in was the sex appeal, but what made me stick around was the fact that the characters had a certain degree of depth, they may have served as a visual selling point, but they proved to be well-written enough that they became characters that you grow attached to and feel the same concern for that the protagonist does.I especially like that the Protagonist's Grandfather, who is the mastermind behind the whole Time Machine deal, doesn't take a back seat to all the going-ons involved in the story, he maintains a continuous participation throughout and serves also as a teacher in making the player have at least some grasp of the technical nature of how the time travel in this story worked; what, did you think this was boob game and nothing more? so did I, glad I was wrong though.Overall I truly do recommend this game, not just for the whole sex appeal deal, but because it actually felt lengthy and filled with a truly shocking amount of techno-babble that makes your mind work. There were times where I actually stopped, ignored the overlarge breasts on the screen and sat there trying to map out in my head just what the f*ck was going on in time stream that one of the characters just tried to explain, and for the most part these explanations actually allowed me to connect the dots.Boobs."
,Not Recommended,420950,34557658,Posted: 28 August,all,rdeforest,"Poorly written wish-fulfilment.I've only played for 30 minutes but so far it's pretty bad. It seems like it was written by a sheltered virgin teen-age boy. So basically me 30 years ago.Specific example of poor writing: a character mentions the butterfly effect, then mentions it again two sentences later. There are also obvious typos like ""there as another"" instead of ""there was another"".Also, who goes shopping in public wearing a sheer teddy?"
