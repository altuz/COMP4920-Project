,Recommended,420980,31286506,Posted: 21 April,all,✩ Helenα ✩,"I think this is the best title by Dharker Studio so far. I honestly enjoyed more than I expected, and it was quite satisfying to get all the achievements. The three main girls are the highlight together with the diverse choices that can lead to lots of possibilities.The story seems simple at first, but there are so many possibilities here that it’s insane.You can literally have an orgy because of a magical fairy’s power and there’s also a f*cking psycho wanting to kill you. NOW THAT’S DIVERSITY.The girls are great too, even if the MC is somewhat blah with little personality. They definitely make that up with the narration and dialogues, and I found myself caring about the characters. It’s not a masterpiece, but definitely a good experience if you want fan service and lots of interaction.7/10. I wish that the MC was more developed (and had a face lol) to be honest. BGM can get repetitive after a while, and the art style is okay (it could’ve been better to be honest, but at the same time it kinda gave the game a certain charm. It’s like, that’s the “Army Gals style”. I don’t know how to explain). I recommend this title if you’re not only after beewbs since there’s lots of choices and dialogues. Also, the R18 scenes are animated."

76561198040702503,Recommended,420980,31948382,Posted: 25 May,all,DerEider,"Well, fellow Gamers, ARMY GALS really surprised me !  I was expecting a quick casual anime-Visual Novel with a few 'Chievos in which the guy tries to romance every gal in the story and be done with it.Not so fast there, Eider !  There is some meat on these VN bones !And just to make it clear that this is not a ""compensated"" review, I paid $16.99 for it in April.  That is more than the current price in the Steam Store !  And I do not feel bad about that.  I got more than my money's worth of entertainment from ARMY GALS !!This Visual Novel's story is worth your taking a look at it.  What I found in This ARMY GALS story is much more complex than the run-of-the-mill VN.  It has elements of  survival against the odds, a mad serial killer, tragedy, pathos, true love, murder {?} mystery, conspiracy plot, fantasy, and horror.  OK, it has its mandatory quota of sexual romps.  However, the overall story really iscompelling.ARMY GALS has 21 game “Endings” which take a while to sort out.  Including these, there are 30 Steam Achievements to earn.  The Dev {Dharker Studios} has been responsive to gamer comments in the Forum.  One ending would not work in the initial release.  Dharker figured out what was wrong and promptly released a new version to fix it.  Dharker also has responded to Gamer questions and has given hints on how to reach endings.Speaking of the Dev, Dharker Studios has on easy-to-install online Restoration Patch that undoes the Steam censoring.  Dharker are pros at this and have done an excellent job of providing an 18++ rated VN.The SETUP:	You become the Protagonist; Kyle, a male ""delinquent"" who was framed as being a Peeping Tom arsonist.  What a combination !!  You were sent here because they lacked proof of your “crimes”.  What role will you play as this multi-ending tale evolves ?You are met at a train station by the 2 Aggressive Rehabilitative Missionary Youth {A.R.M.Y.} Program counselors who will take you on a 2-day trip into the depths of a remote forest.   There you meet your fellow delinquents; 3Girls, of course !  You all are to camp out here and commune with nature whilst the Counselors work their magic upon your collective psyches.The next day, the head Counselor, of the famed {?} A.R.M.Y. Program, is found dead in a car wreck.  How did that happen ?  Was it an accident ?  Or was it murder ?  If murder, who “dunnit” ?  The only other Counselor left after a disagreement with that head Counselor, so she may never come back.  Nobody else knows where you are.  YOU don't know where you are.How can this group of misguided and leaderless delinquents possibly get back to civilization from where you have been abandoned deep in a vast forest when you aren't sure of even the right direction to go ?  What deadly dangers lie in wait for you if you try; Bears, traps, ravines, mountains, serial killer, fantasy creatures ?  Or should you wait for rescue ?  How long will your food last. ?  Can you carry what you will need to make it out ?Well … Enough of this doom-and-gloom stuff.  Let's spend a day skinny dipping while we {try NOT to} think about it !If you work through this VN without a “walk-through” to hold your hand, it should provide a challenge for several hours.  My Steam hours played is quite misleading.  You won't have to spend anywhere near that time to complete ARMY GALS.  I had the game up for days at a time while trying to put together a Guide, that now is available for your perusal.  Just right-click the game in your Library and select “Community Guides”."

76561198045390165,Not Recommended,420980,31208803,Posted: 17 April,all,Madiovas,"So after playing this game for a while, finishing one possible ending (#7) and scouting through other options after I've come to the following conclusion. Please don't take this too harshly as I really never play erotic novel games. Skip to bottom for tl/dr / conclusion.PROS:1. Let's start off possitive, this game brings a very decent variaty of possible endings. Some of them more interesting than the other but it feels like there is a lot variety which is good. Some storylines countain new characters that give an extra dimension to the story and feel a bit refreshing. I applaud the creators for putting effort into making 25+ storylines.2. The characters are cliché but interesting enough to keep the story going.3. Original artwork!4. The sexual encounters you do find are pretty entertaining although sometimes a bit too much.CONS:1. This is a big one in my opinion. Despite bringing original art work into a game which I truly respect, and find refreshing, the drawings were lackluster.There weren't nearly enough drawing of all the different settings (which were plentiful!) to support all the stories. I found a lot of drawing reused or simply mirrored for completely different settings. This was a big disappointment. Besides that the quality of the drawing left a lot to wish for. Weirdly shaped bodyparts, weird angles and sometimes facial expressions.2. Conversations were extremely long (actually some taking over 20 minutes to get through) and not interesting enough for me to actually read. Shame. There also aren't many options for you to interact with the story which made it even more of a stretch. Also I've encountered where the options you DID have lead to the same scenes over and over (sometimes even on different times in the story and in repetition!). Definitely could have used some more effort.3. There is no real way to go after any given girl. You just wound up in random situations with a random girl which can lead to some anoyance. Sometimes you spend hours trying to get to the specifics and end up nowhere which kinda defeats the purpose.4. A lack of sexual nudity if that is what you're looking for.CONCLUSION/ TL:DR:Although this game brings some original artwork and a big variety of different endings, the subpar/mediocre artwork, stretched conversations and mostly the lack of interaction in those, combined with the lack of nudity/sexual content makes it impossible for me to recommend this game. It has good moments and features but it simply isnt enough to overlook the obvious flaws. If this was free it might be worth a go but I wouldn't waste your money on it."

I thought this would be another one of those novelty ""have sex with everyone you can"" dating sims. I did not expect that the adventure tag would be so true. for this game truely took me on an adventure.when i think about the individual parts that make up this game, i feel like i should hate it, or atleast dislike it. there is a lot of tonal inconsistancy, but somehow it just all came together into a wonderful experience. (spoilers from this point on) a few examples of points that bothered me: badass smart girl can be easily provoked into going nude. And just in general how easy the girls are about being nude or getting sexual with the MC. Why is the shy girl suddenly down for skinny dipping or strip poker? why is tough girl down for the things she does? normally id just role with it but the way these scenes can be intersperesed with very serious scenes, and with the characters being in life or death situations, is just offputting at times. also why didnt we tie up reed or kill him or take his gun when we first dealt with him? seems like a dumbass move.but for some reason this vn has stuck with me far more than the dozens of others ive played. easily one of my top 5 vns. It doesnt have my favorite grills, or my favorite stories, nor my favorite art. But just god damn♥♥♥♥♥♥on a fat kid, somehow the way it came together was magical."

76561198021793898,Recommended,420980,31282888,Posted: 21 April,all,Cleerdence,"Army Gals is a story about a high school student Named kyle who due to unlucky circumstances, ends up attending a ""Delinquint"" rehabilitation camp. Set in the woods, kyle meets a variety of characters, the main three being edda, raen, and andrea along with several minor characters. The story progresses as the characters interact, face perhaps deadly challeneges, and have a little fun.Art 8/10 - The art resembled Japanese animation typical of a visual novel, but it felt more american. This does not take away from the good artwork of the characters, or the backgrounds of the game. This game does contain nudity, so please be advised.Gameplay 10/10 - The gameplay is very limited because it is a visual novel, but thats exactly what you would expect from a visual novel. It did it's job in telling the story, and it seems to have many routes to take which offered a wide variety of outcomes, and a good enough compliment of possible choices.Story 8/10 - The story was quite interesting and actually had me guessing and wanting to know what was going to come next. Some scenes were well put together with a nice compliment of erotic, emotional, horror, and thrilling scenes. The game also provides multiple endings to suite the tastes of the player.Music/Sound 6/10 - The Music for this game i found was nice, but also bland. While enjoying the game, i would actually sometimes forget that music did accompany the game.Overall 9/10 - Overall i really enjoyed the game, clocking in 12 hours of gameplay with all achievements completed. The amount of possible routes in the game made it fun and never boring, and well worth the 13.99$.A few last minute commentsthe owners of the game have put out an uncensored patch for the game containing adult video scenes, adult illustrations,Adult Scenes, Character Sprites, Animated scenes, Extra adult section in the gallery, extra animation section, and you get to unlock the steam achievment ""patched at start""http://steamcommunity.com/app/420980/discussions/0/135514231765617537/<== uncensored path informationAlso the developers of the game will also be releasing a new dlc scene with the deluxe editon some time this year.I highly recommend this game for any visual novel lover."

It all makes sense in the ending I got. It is not porn so if that is what you are looking for you may be disappointed. It does have nudity and sex. It is not appropriate for children.

The music was nice, I found it set the mood perfectly throughout the game.Story and CharactersI found writing and story quite enjoyable, I laughed felt anger and was on the edge of my seat the entire time! I enjoyed getting every end without fail. Far as Edda Andrea, Raen and Kyle, I felt Kyle was pretty much an average Visual Noval main protagonist. I enjoyed Edda as being a strong confident Female character, with a interesting background (avoiding spoilers) Raen the typical Lovey Female as portrayed in most Visual Novals with quite the twist! And last but not least, Andrea now I enjoyed her as a character as much as the rest, but I felt that the personality they aimed for her kept getting lost, with her going from one way to the next, now that's not a complaint, I enjoy more diverse character's.Pros and ConsPros:Good storyFantastic artGood patchGood musicDecent side character'sCons:Not enough artSaves are kinda confusingA very enjoyable Visual Noval which I am EXCITED for more Art like this from Dharker Studios and the future (I hope) DLC(s) for this game!

,Recommended,420980,34411167,Posted: 22 August,all,✪ H1tScAn_LΣO9999 ✪,"Army Gals is a Visual Novel developed by Dharker Studios.It has been a pleasing surprise to play this game.Let's see thePROS+Very well made characters. There are few, but they all have their distinct characteristics.Trust me, especially the three gals, are rendered astonishingly well, and you will end up loving them because of how they are more than how they look.+Very well written story, i actually enjoyed the story a lot, especially because of a very big secret and surprise that i won't spoil you. It'd be a crime.+Good character art. Definitely liked the art style for the three gals.+Lots of endings, some good, some bad, and you really have to keep trying to get the ending you want. Trust me, it won't always go like you planned.+Realistic? Yes. But they throwed up a few nonsense stuff inside that... Well... You have to see it...+The dialogue feels good and quite real, actually. These gals won't ♥♥♥♥ you randomly just 'cause you asked. At least, two of them won't.+The uncensored patch is a must. Bonus points for keeping it free. Noted.+Well written. Only two grammar errors spotted. Unless you're really paying a lot of attention, your brain will skip right through them.So, there are a lot of pros. But what about theCONS-The backgrounds are reused way too often. There could've been more of them, especially because they get reused in the same scene pretty often.-There is a particular scene being really awkward, where a night conversation will take place in the wrong location. Probably  a dev oversight, but it won't be easy to fix, as the game would need another entire night to be added.-Would've liked a bit more choices that could influence my reputation with the girls. Sure, the choices are solid right now, but sometimes they ask something and you're railroaded to one answer. Not a large issue, and went unnoticed for the first runs.-Less H-Scenes than how many there actually are, leaving those to text description.Since the patch is free, tho, i'll give this one less points.------------------------VerdictArmy Gals is a very good VN, and i whole heartedly recommend it.You' get affectionated to the characters, and the story really picks you up.A few hours of great fun.

76561198116379581,Recommended,420980,34203168,Posted: 12 August,all,mxi,"I've played through three endings so far, mostly the happy endings because that's what I'm in the business of playing VNs for. Happy endings, escapism, and metric tons of sex. Before the next paragraph turns you off, I'd like to say, straight out, that this was a great game, and I'm glad I got it.For this price, the game is worth trying out, at least. It's a bit rough around the edges; the UI is crude, there's no voice acting, and some of the H-scenes have no CG. The story straddles a border between heavy and light, and it's got a weird, outlandish feel.However, that's not a bad thing. If I had to describe this game using a cliche, I'd definitely call it a ""diamond-in-the-rough"". It's got all the qualities to be amazing (it even gives me Grisaia vibes, which I love) but everything just needs to be sanded more smoothly. Still, for this price, the game is definitely worth it. Despite all I said, the characters and story are memorable, and despite the awkward brevity with which they treat serious issues, there's still a sincere respect for it all that I can appreciate. There's enough reading, choices, and H-scenes that you don't feel cheated (again, for this great low price) and there's even a little animation at points for extra spice.This was a great game. It may slip out of my memory soon enough, as I play enough VNs to kill a horse, but the ride was totally worth it. I definitely look forward to Dharker Studio's future works and may even check out their past works. The Western VN scene is small right now and I love that Dharker Studio is blazing their way into an unexplored wilderness, taking some notes from Japanese success but bringing their own unique flair to it, with a HUGE amount of endings and choices, unique subject matter catering to Western audiences, and a cool original art style.If Dharker Studio is reading this, thanks, and keep up the great work! I look forward to the Poker Night DLC as well as the other games you've got brewing."

I actually found myself re-reading the dialog many times over as I went through each of the 20 possible endings.The artwork, while being standard Dharker fare for the most part, is at the higher end of their particular spectrum. If you use the uncensored patch, this game includes some pretty decent animated movie bits, and the H content is quite delightfully explicit, yet not over the top.The characters are definitely some of my favourites (Andrea is now my top waifu), and the dialog flows well through most of the game. There's a few rough patches in less-traveled branches of the story, but the rest is some good reading.All in all, if you like visual novels with sexual innuendo (and content!), this is a game for you.

The games story is about the main character ""Kyle"" going to a stupid program for delinquents because he was accused of setting fire to his school and something else i dont remeber right now...sorry. Anyway, you are being sent to this camp for other delinquents in the middle of nowhere, where there is 3 other girls who are in the same situation as you. To speed things up a bit, something happens that i wont spoil, that forces the 3 girls and you to find you're way back to civilization. The story isn't anything special, but it was certaintly enjoyable for me.2. If you like a visual novel with a lot of choices like me, then look no further. There is a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of choices wich allows for a bunch of different endings, wich are all pretty different from each other.3. A important aspect of a visual novel is the grammer, sooooo does this game have good grammar?...Yes...well for the most part. There is a few typos here and there but nothing special if you dont pay attention you might even overlook them, that's how minor they are so don't worry about the grammar and writing they are both decent ;)4.

And if you are wondering about the visuals...Just look at the screenshots.Final Verdict: The Visual novel is solid in my opinion and is personally worth the 13 Euro's its asking for. And if you can get it on sale and you like visual novels, this should be a no-brainer ;)BTW: There is a 18+ patch that adds a few more ""Adult"" scenes to the whole thing and there's even an achivment for installing it...Yeah...GET IT!

Although their writing usually consists of pairing the protagonist up with girls, and doing a bit of work to get towards 'certain' content, this goes well beyond that. At the beginning of the game, with Shelton's appearance, he infuriated me greatly.I figured his introduction would prove to make getting content difficult, because his attitude gave me that kind of impression. But after finding out what happens to him, then meeting Hannah, the game gets soo real. Raen is my all time favorite, with the chemistry the protag shows with Hannah being the only other relationship contesting that.For her to be so serious after meeting Reed, was just way too ♥♥♥♥ed up. Son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ got what he deserved. I was soo happy there was an ending where the girls all made it. This isn't an ordinary Dharker Studio game, as the content has pacing to it not normally found in others. Camping gone wrong though, is more fitting.Very replayable as far as I've seen, and I really can't emphasize how impressed I am how different the writing is in this one than others.It's very well done, and deserves every purchase it gets."

The characters, story, art, bg, and music I loved all of them:)I didn't expect Army Gals to be a long game and I'm glad it was because I had a lot of fun getting all 30 endings.Army Gals has lots of things that I didn't expect. Army Gals has comedy, romance, really hot scenes that some are animated;), creepy, and some horror elements.

Army Gals is mix of ecchi (or hentai with the uncensored patch) and survival/thriller (at least the endings I've finished so far).  The story is fairly simple, but with lots of choices, and the Gals are all cute with their own well developed personalities."

But I go so hooked that I had to beat it and do multiple playthrough.Characters are great and the art is great too. Sex scenes are fun as well. Personalities are very distinct. A great game and a must play I think for VN fans.NOTE: It's an adult game completely. Yes, there's sex but there are some dark themes.There's implied♥♥♥♥♥♥ sexual assault.

,Recommended,420980,33622247,Posted: 17 July,all,Hentai,"This VN really took me by surprise. I bought it mainly just because I'm a pervert but I was surprised to find a good story and interesting characters. I haven't played any of Dharker's games before, so I went in kind of blind but this VN definitely left a very good impression.The good: good story, interesting characters, and not-so-bad artwork. The girls are very unique in appearance and personality, but they all clique together well at the same time. Even the side characters that aren't shown much are well designed. Every character you meet plays a critical role in the story. Despite being a VN, it also has a bit of choose your own adventure mixed in, which is great! Different directions you go within the forest can yield wildly different results, so try them all out. There are tons of endings, each girl has at least 3 (4 if you count harem ending) and there are endings for some side characters and 'short' endings.like getting mauled by a bear or ""eaten"" by a witch.The bad: Some of the text doesn't really match up with the scene at all, but that's pretty easy to look past. The routes can be overly complicated, some might think this is good, but I can't imagine most do. I can't think of anything else.In short; it's a good VN and worth a read if you're into this type of thing. It's also worth trying to getmostof the endings you want, I found it hard to get a good ending my first go roundAndrea stabbed me ; ;"

Reminded me a bit of ""endless summer"" in term of tone, themes, and twists.  The art is pretty good and par the course for this developper.  The echhi is decent and really uncensored (with patch) but remains fairly vanilla (no real kink, no sm, no nc, no backdoor, etc.)  Characters are well developped and there is a lot of different routes and endings (I have unlocked about half I think, one of which was ending #21).  I felt unsatisfied after Bunny Bounce and Beauty Bounce, but this one is good."

It has a great story with multiple endings and thus allowing multiple play throughs. Some of the endings are not easy to discover which forces you to really pay attention and try different things. there are some great ;) adult scenes and some great artwork. The story itself has a few twists i didn't see coming and you may miss some of them unless you play multiple times.Theres a lot of content in this game, and i'm definitely going to try to find it all."
76561198033250948,Recommended,420980,33803745,Posted: 26 July,all,RikuoftheKnight,"WARNING; long review is long... I think. And spoilery.So I found this scrolling through my queue and was going to look past it, thinking it another ecchi game that I'd regret wasting the money on. However, seeing all the positive reviews for it I decided to install it and give it a chance.Now granted, the ecchi stuff is still present (thanks mainly to the efforts of a certain blue-haired character), but it takes second stage to what is a truly interesting and at times harsh storyline. The amount of ways to affect how the story plays out are also good, meaning your choices do matter and decide which outcome you'll get. And trust me; you will find ones where you die. I've achieved a good chunk of the endings but it took me til my fourth playthrough to get what many would consider a good ending.The characters are interesting. My one complaint is that I wish there could've been voice actors, even voice sound effects every now and then. That doesn't detract from the actual story though, and all three girls are well developed as people with layers of depth about them. The background art was fine, though on some it wasn't as good (like one of the instances you come across a cabin). The music was good, though I feel the tracks either weren't long enough or were used in scenes that might not match up, though that's my opinion and half the time I'm most likely wrong on audio stuff. As for the mechanics, it took me a while to find out how to bring up the menu mid-game, but otherwise it was fine. The fastforward button's a godsend when you're going completionist and don't want to wade through the same conversation a dozen times.Overall:This game may appear as just another fanservice game, but beneath the skin there's quite a bit to like about this one. A good story with multiple avenues towards endings good and bad, meaning choices suddenly carry more weight, carry this game more than the girls assets. There are some areas for improvement but the majority of my complaints are nitpicks as I found myself enjoying it and driven to get all the endings.7.5/10TD;LRComes for the boobs, stay for the story."

,Not Recommended,420980,34229588,Posted: 13 August,all,Rubigasm,"Edit: I've toiled through many endings, and I hate most of them. Why? Because I'm unrealisticly cornered into a lot of bull. Choices affect not only how people react, or my actions, but also apparently random things as well. Things that could not at all be related to my vocalizations. That's railroading, and in a game like this it's cheap and unfair.This game is awful.I'm not sure how this sort of game is supposed to work, but the story was decent until I hit the end.I got the Cheryl end, and equipped with the feeling that something went wrong, and maybe there are other endings, I feel dejected. Dissapointed. I don't even want to play again and see. I probably won't.And, sure there were♥♥♥♥♥♥ but all th sex scenes were blacked out and done through description. Isn't that an important part of games like this? Gert some guts and do it right. The fact that proportions were all wring also bugged me. No one has arms that thin and survives. Edda should have been toned. The one purple haired girl had asymmetrical hips, which anotomically makes no sense.The art as okay overall, but I don't know, it felt lacking. The backgrounds clashed with the characters, the text windows were out of place and had no borders.It seems like I'm missing a lot of the game, judging by the spoiler-filled community feed, but honestly I don't know if I care enough to go back and check it out. I give it a 6/10. Maybe I'll come back, and avoid Cheryl. Maybe not. The lack of explicit scenes is a huge downer."
