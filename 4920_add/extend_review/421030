,Recommended,421030,23572129,"Posted: 15 June, 2016",all,Perona,"This game is a burglary game, most similar in style to games like Monaco. You play a magician, out to steal riches owned by evil people, and have a set of 'props', or tricks, to distract guards with.The game is designed to be asynchronous multiplayer, like some other recent games: You go out and steal stuff from either the computer or from other players, and the other player can watch a replay of your attempts to steal their loot. They even let you leave notes behind for players to give your thoughts on their maze, leave tips, or taunt them if you so desire.Currently, the game has 3 different characters, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and special abilities.The developer is incredibly present, and always does his best to answer concerns and make changes. For instance, some people were getting tired of hearing their magician's quips, and asked for an option to mute voices on the forum, and within a very short period of time, the option was added to the options menu.The only real issues right now are grammatical in nature. Since the developer is not a native English speaker, some voice clips and text lines don't really make that much sense. However, this is relatively minor, and the actual gameplay relies very little on the text, so you can play for a while without really noticing.All in all, this game rocks my socks, and I'd recommend getting it now. It's completely playable, and is not missing any major features, which is more than I can say for a lot of early access games."

When i first saw this game i got it for its clash of clans like feel. not only that, but i love stealth games. So this game is right up my alley. I was not dissapointed by this game. It is very fun. Played for 4 hours straight before i ran out of other players to rob. And im going to play this more. for $5 this game is a must for any stealth fan, or tower defense, kind of. now I am going to list fun things that happend in game.1. I got to 200 roses in 1 night.2 i robbed alot of people.3. me and this guy got into a rob war, and left notes and kinda talked to each other.4. he slipped and lost the war. i won!5. made a amazing maze. went to rob some guy, came back to 2 guys being caught in my maze. 10/10.Now, There is only 1 problem i had with the game itself. and its not huge, but its something noticeable.1. After playing for 4 hours straight and i noticed it a bit in the early hours, i ran out of people to rob.2 THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IN THE GAME SO FAR, i am a level 3 maze, and have been getting level 6's and even level 7, 8, and 10. i cant beat thier mazes. and they are going to come back hard. I want more mazes around my level. i can beat the level 6's sometimes. but anything higher i cant beat. and this combined with the last one means that the only 3 i get sometimes i just too high for me to beat. meaning i have nothing to do. if they fixed this one atleast then the game would be so much better.but other than them. this game is just amazing and i really hope you get it. its very cheap and is so good for the mere $5 price. Thank you for reading this and have a wonderful day! Also, if i had to rate this game i would give it a 7/10, it would be a 9/10 if these 2 flaws were removed, or reworked.Also, if the devs are reading this. Then i have 1 feature i would like to see a way you can test your own maze, aka fight your own maze. you would not gain or lose anything. Its purely to test how easy it is to beat. If this was added it would be much more easy to see how strong your defense. Thats the only thing i think the game is missing. Thank you for reading this."

So far you can play as 3 characters, each built slightly different then the next... but I have one problem, the character Walter is the only character built for end game, his faster money taking ability is the main reason he is #1 picked...Then there is Perona, the Little Lady, her ability is to knock out the enemies with money, and it takes 300 for each enemy, and to make it worse it only has a 40% chance to actually knock them out... you will probably end up losing more money then you make if you try to use her.And finally we have Rosario... he is the default character, the only thing that makes him special is his strange ability that allows you to heal some health and mana by throwing out a pidgeon that cooks itself, the funny thing about this is it takes 10 mana to throw it out, and it only heals 10 health and 4 mana, so I guess that is that, and to make it even worse, when you throw out pidgeons you normally throw them far, so you actually have to go and retrieve the cooked corpse of the bird to even use his ability at all.now, I know this game is early access, so I am really hoping the devs can buff Perona and Rosario to make them viable for endgame. I am going to give a really good example.so Walter has this thing where if you put your rose points into Agility, it makes him faster at taking money out of safes, now what you could do for Perona is make it cost less money if you put points into the brain stat.and for Rosario, make the cooked bird heal more health when you put points into the Physique stat. This would be a perfect change, and would make all of the characters have some sort of endgame."

It has an old school graphic design which reminds me the old days playing arcade games.Basically I would say it's an arcade style HITMAN. You are a magician thief just like those guys from ""Now you see me"". And you need to sneak around and steal the cash in the safe. You can hire different magicians who have different passive skills. And you have quite a few choices of using props to distract and get around the guards.However, just like the newly released HITMAN, it requires always online as well, which is a bit disappointing. Despite some basic built-in tutorial campaigns (they called them mazes), you will have to design your own campaign which keeps your money in the safe from the other players and you'll be playing campaigns done by other players to steal money from them.Overall the game is great and quite interesting but there's still room for improvement. Some people are reporting their game crashes on start-up (but mine is fine). Some pictures and menus are not in English and some instructions are not that clear. But it's just been released and in early access stage so I wouldn't be worried too much and the dev team is quite responsive in terms of bug fixing and game experience improving. I would totally recommend this game to my friends."

This is a game that is easy to start, hard to master and yet doesn't take itself too seriously.

I recommend this game to everyone that's looking for a game in this genre, but doesn't want something too hardcore.Gameplay:  You have three characters you can choose and infiltrate other (real) player's mazes and try to steal as much money as you can.  To completely finish a level you have to loot all of their safes.  You are also able to equip 3 distraction items to help you get past guards.You will also have the opportunity to customize your own maze so that other players may attempt to steal your money.One issue with this game is always needing internet to play, if you have no connection or disconnect you can't play the game.  The developer has expressed some interest in singleplayer, no internet required, content thougg; so this could be a thing in future updates.Overall my experience was great, it will definitely keep you entertained for a good amount of time."
,Recommended,421030,23648719,"Posted: 19 June, 2016",all,Lain,"Fun and challenging game, perfect for quick and short bursts of play during the day.It's Early Access, but the game has been very stable for me.The only problem of note I can signal is the online connection the game needs (so you can rob other players): if there are problems with the network, you will get dropped out of the session and back to the loading screen.At the start of the Early Access a lack of servers for EU was creating problems but it was quickly addressed by the developers.The pixel art in the game is really nice and the animations are rather charming.The music is limited but fits the mood well and it's OK.I've been using mostly Rosa, so I can't comment on the other 2 characters, but his voice lines are cool. He does repeat them a bit too much though.The best part of the game has to be robbing other players' lair. The level of challenge varies, obviously, but it does make the normal mazes feel more like practice for those times when a player pops up on the map. It's also interesting to see how other players planned their maze, where they put the guards and the patterns. Makes for good learning.Robbing others and getting robbed yourself is part of the game, so the replay feature to re-watch your stunts or the stunts pulled on you is not only a nice feature but, again, a way to learn, especially when it comes to others players paying you a visit: you get to see how they tackled your maze, what worked and what didn't in your placements of guards, helping you tighten up your maze for the next incursion.And speaking of nice features, being able to leave a message for your victims is a nice touch.The current asking price, 5€, is nice and cheap and, in my opinion, fully worth it."

Mix that with random players which will appear as targets aswell...This game is absolutely amazing and will give you a lot of fun.The gameplay itself is simple but engaging. You acquire (or lose, after failing an attempt to steal another players) roses, which you use to improve your basic stats and you have your typical magician tricks (Doves, hypnosis...) to play with your enemies mind on your way to their safes.The fun point becomes in the form of letter, which you can leave to other players after the burglary, whether you succeded or not...I'm really hoping for this game to get big."

,Recommended,421030,30306214,Posted: 3 March,all,Baphomet,"Ever wonder what would happen if China made a game similar to the Thomas Crown affair but with magicians, mazes, and wacky guards? That’s Catch Me in a nutshell. This two-faceted game has you invading other players’ mazes to steal their money while building up your own fortress to safeguard your ill-gotten gains.On the attack, your goal is to loot every safe with the option of collecting coins scattered about the level along the way. Successful raids and defenses yield roses, a flexible unit that can be shifted to any of three attributes before the start of every mission. Over time you will collect enough money to upgrade your (maze) level and gain access to better guards and additional safes.Gameplay in Catch Me is very resource-dependent, with your character limited to a maximum of three different tools (out of a selection of six total) each having its own weight and MP cost. Carrying too much into one mission can slow you down and carrying too little won’t allow you to complete your objectives. Managing your MP is equally critical as you don’t have much of it, even at higher rose levels due to diminishing returns. Fog is another important element of the game since a lot of enemies don’t reveal their positions to you at the start of the mission and you must spend money and MP via flares to find them.For the first six or seven levels of mazes this game is actually really fun and you get to experiment with all sorts of different strategies to outsmart each player’s defenses. After that, it becomes impossible to finish a round without expending every single bit of MP in addition to using cost-saving tricks like deliberately getting caught in snares to lure guards or allowing explosive guards to attack you, “tanking” the damage. Parrot guards become especially annoying as they can be placed outside of the playable area and you will have to peek into a player’s maze, spend loads of money on flares, and then leave and re-enter the maze with their positions memorized so you can re-flare them for your actual playthrough in order to succeed. This gets really tedious and downright unrewarding, especially since the payout for high level invasions can actually be lower than that of low level players since it is dependent on the amount of money they have in storage.Is Catch Me worth picking up? As of November 2016, the developer posted a message saying that development would not continue, meaning that updates are a foregone conclusion. This game is still really addictive at lower levels for at least 12+ hours so I’ll give this advice: “Rob the developer and pick this game up on sale, it’ll be a real steal”."

I can tell the game will be improved during Early Access since they are constantly seeking answers from players to help improve the game. Unfortunately- Catch Me was not a game for me, but might be a game for you. I will probably come back and support this game, and the developers once they release the game out of Early Access. I hope to eventually see a fully fledged game with everlasting content avaliable.Replayability is key.I've been debating for the past 24-hours whether or not I should change my recommendation stance on the game. I must've changed my stance multiple times by now, but have come to the conclusion of positive reccomendation.I will recommend the game to otherssince my own experience might've not been the full experience the game has to offer. I have since greatly improved my review, since the developer took the time&effort to get into contact with me to understand my review- to help improve the game.This review is not final and is based on my short experience with Early Access. Hope some of the listed cons receive some much needed loving.A-ton of other ways to improve the game beyond what i've listed below.Pros/Cons - Personal EditionPros+Gameplay -It's fun to steal from lootchests, conquering the map, disappearing into the night with your money/loot.+Artwork -I love the art, since it reminds me of paper mario.+Audio -Music is fantastic, general sounds are pretty good.Cons-Gameplay -Much to be expanded and improved upon. Tons of potential and needs major expansion to keep players interested beyond 24H. Here are some gameplay improvement suggestions: Bigger Maps, Fake Lootchests, Alarms, etc. Basically more mechanics to overwhelm and challenge the player. I feel like the money you steal needs more important purpose in the game. Somehow.-Characters/AI -Introduce more burglars to play- or improve current existing burglars to be more exciting/unique. More AI to challenge the player/defend against incoming burglars, or when you are stealing from AI/Player. Here are some of my own suggestions: Units that cannot be stunned(hypnotized) and only distracted. Lootchests that move around on feet around the map. Swat?-AudioVoice acting in the game is off and could use some improvement. It would be nice to hear a scream reaction when you die- or when you're opening/stealing a chest a drill/banging noise of some sorts. Additional smartly placed audio in certain areas can only improve the overall experience.-Multiplayer needs improved upon.*Critical of the Description*""Catch Me"" is amassively-multiplayer gameof burglary and base defense.I never got the chance to steal from another player. I was lured in by the summary description which promised some sort of online connectivity with other players. In the short time that I played, I was unable to find a single player online. Population seems to be horrible on the United States, and you cannot connect to players outside the US. My suggestions for improvement: Deliver on improving the multiplayer part, to a point where even if you are lacking players you will still feel like the game is online (because it is online) and promotes online connectivity.Players rob each other in this world.Keyword: Players? Where? What Players?I would absolutely love for the multiplayer base defense part of the game to be expanded and improved upon.I'm pretty sure I didn't face any human players,otherwise the maps probably would've been more exciting and challenging. It may have multiplayer capability built inside, but is poorly executed and fails to show. You cannot choose where you want your castle to be placed on the map, and it would be cool to be able to choose. I think being able to rename your place and set a public message for players to see would give a sense of player activity/connectivity. I would even take it a step further and consider adding a chat box for additional multiplayer functionality. Improved multiplayer functions to help the world come alive- beyond what it feels like currently; which is offline castle storming.Catch Me is pretty cheap & similar to the price of a burger and fries.I personally would rather spend the money on burger and fries, since the game leaves me feeling hungry for more. This is my Early Access review and the game simply didn't appeal to me, and I ended up refunding(but also because of technical issues/stuttering). I think the game has potential- and with the developers actively engaging with the community is encouraging. It makes me wish I stuck around a bit more.I wish the developers/authors the best luck improving the game during Early Access.Here is some quick gameplayfor anyone interested.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W05Ci2bVijw"

It reminds me of a mobile game I spent a good amount of time on: King of Thieves. It's the concept and game mechanic of building and raiding bases that intrigues me intesely. There is, however, a few flaws that must be addressed.For instance - I noticed early on that players learn the value of 'overguarding'. This is to stick all of your gold and sentry/guards in one corner. This defense, though simple, is pretty much 100% unbeatable. In a way, this is good, but early on in the game, it ruins the cohesion of the tutorial and the multiplayer formula.It's a simple fix, but a small adjustment in the ability to place certain sentries could cure the issue until a permanent fix is decided.Other than that, the game is great. I haven't played much, but I enjoy what I've seen. There is a decent mix of customization and development put into the total build that is pretty exciting.To the developers, I would suggest working on the English a little bit. Here and there I get confused by what's being said sometimes. I don't know if it's just a miscommunication thing, or what, but I would suggest take a couple double looks here and there just to make sure everything's in shape. Great job, though.

Wrong, firstly from what I played there was a huge lack in what I could do with my maze apart from sticking a few guards in next to the safes and bam you've done it!The music sucks because most from what I've heard is stock/royalty free music and yes I have used these music on my old youtube videos so there is nothing really amazing here. Also the voice acting is awful, like really bad your character says stuff that literally makes no sense you can turn this option off but still it's really cringeworthy.My biggest gripe with the game is how lackluster it is, sure it has some ideas that could potentially be fun, but unfortunately it falls flat, In my opinion I just found this game boring.

The levels are quickly boring and slow as all hell to navigate, let alone look at. Hold up your hand and look at it and you will see more content and detail than there is in this game. I would rather stare at a black and white picture of the desert for an hour.

Since most of them are barebones mechanics, it sorta depends on the game whether or not that'll actually be fun to play in and of itself...I think I can safely say, I really like this game .,.Even though it's still relatively limited on terms of things you can unlock or purchase (other than guards, those are pretty well expanded already), those that exist already are helpful gadgets that are well balanced by the decrease in speed you get for taking them. The note system is, as far as I can tell, the best thing EVER. In relation to that, however, I can't help but wish I could leave tips for people to make them feel better about being robbed/be even more smarmy than just leaving a note.All in all, I am thoroughly entertained C:Whoever's reading this should totally go buy this game and play with me .,.Edit: I would pay significant amounts of money for the OST to this game."

But it still sticks me about an hour per day sneaking into various mazes of other players and collect roses to be stronger, just like these smooth episodes you'd really like to watch. And, furthermore, it's still frequently improving! 没什么新的意见，希望越来越好！"

The concept of taking peoples stuff is an easy one to pick up but the puzzles and underlying details of said puzzles are what makes this game a blast.10/10 Will keep playing.
