,Recommended,421040,32173562,Posted: 4 June,all,IFIYGD,"Overall Rating 6.5/10Not really worth full price, but alright on a good sale.Clicker game, clearly meant to by on mobile (phones or tablets). On a computer monitor, the trees, shrubs, garden plots, animals, butterflies, animals and birds are all huge, and very busy.Your mouse cursor is TINY.No way to set the cursor to a larger size either. Once you have any amount of activity on screen, the cursor gets lost in all of the patterns and colors and movement on screen. So you click blindly, hoping to somehow magically click what you are hoping to click.It is CUTE. So if you want a cute time killer, this game may be for you.It does get repetative and somewhat boring after just a short while.  Clearlly a mobile port to PC, and perhaps it should have stayed on mobile only. It would be a fine game for killing time while commuting or standing in line for concert tickets, or waiting for a doctor's appointment. But it is just too bland for really fun longplay PC time.Still, if you need cute in your life, and the game goes on sale for at least 50% or more,  it isn't bad. No performance issues on a toaster, no crashing, no hitching, no sound issues. Just aTINYcursor you can't see on screen. Like I said, not a bad game. Just not a great game for all the hype it got when it released.Hesitantly recommending it to those who adore cute, those who really love clicker games and for kids and young teens. I am not sorry I bought it on a deep discount, I am just sorry I am not able to enjoy it more. Perhaps you may?If you are looking for something cute to kill time with on your phone or tablet, go get it from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store. You may enjoy the game more there."

,Not Recommended,421040,21715498,"Posted: 8 March, 2016",all,Perrydotto,"I really wish I could give this one a neutral rating or something, because it's certainly not a bad game, it's just not exactly good, either.I generally enjoy cute clicker games and this one comes with legitimately lovely graphics and music. The production value is very decent for a game of its price, and I had my time of clicking and looking and just generally enjoying the adorable atmosphere.The real issue is that even for a clicker game, you just don't get anything out of it. There is no sense of progression and no rewards for longterm play. I like seeing numbers go up, but even for a skinner box it feels barebones. No additional mechanics are introduced and no new exploration can happen. Once you've seen the basics, you've seen it all, because there is nothing really beyond basics. And for a non free to play game, that just feels too shallow.I think the developer is worthy of support and clearly knows how to make a cute, pleasing game, but it just ultimately fails at really being much of a game. Unless this gets some substantial expansion to the gameplay, I can't really recommend it as a purchase. Keep an eye on the developer, but definitely be critical with your purchase. With this game, you're not getting a whole lot even for the low price of admission."

,Recommended,421040,24376574,"Posted: 17 July, 2016",all,Atarun,"DescriptionPlantera is an idle game, which means that the game will somewhat progress while you do nothing and even, up to a point, when it is closed.Idle games have to walk a thin line between making the player feel useless (in which case the game is actually a screensaver) and having very little idle progress (in which case the game is not much of an idle game). Plantera works that thin line rather well, giving the player incentive to interact with its colorful garden, but also progressing on its own.The point here is to grow plants and raise animals. You can reap the results yourself or let your blue workers do it for you. Critters (rabbits, foxes, wolves and birds) will try to snatch your stuff, though thankfully they never attack the animals, so they never take your progress back. You can either scare the critters away by clicking on them or invest in scarecrows and dogs.ProsCute graphicsSome nice logical interactions (like wolves appearing only if you raise sheep)Easy to complete, especially for an idle game (at least once you understand thatyou do not have to own 100 plants/trees etc, you just have to buy them, so you can trash and rebuy stuff to get the achievements...)ConsEvery upgrade is unlocked very early in the gameIdle mode is a lot more efficient than away mode (with the game closed) even if you invest in the clockNo reset mechanic, even though it has become quite frequent in the genreVerdictIf you've spent time on idle games like Cookie Clicker, Time Clickers and the like, you will probably like Plantera. Just beware that the game is on the short side.If you've never played an idle game before, I would advise you to try some of the free ones to see if you like the concept before buying one, Plantera included."

The game lacks customization features. I believe it could improve with having a quest system or more achievements. I know it's meant to be ""casual"" but it doesn't have to be a one time thing, especially when you pay for the game. The price is extremely fair for what you get, personally I wouldn't mind paying a litte extra because it is a unique game.  I feel it is fun when you are first starting out, but for long term no. I love the cuteness of the characters, the music is repetitve, but not annoying like other games. So, once I have all the achievements unlocked, I'll put my game down.  I  look forward to seeing more updates because  it has a lot of potential, I would love to see more content, so for now I reccomend it."
,Not Recommended,421040,21635093,"Posted: 4 March, 2016",all,TheCyberDruid,"Plantera is a nice (and cute) twist on the standard clicker game that eventually (after two hours) just falls flat due to the lack of 'content'.The idea of the game is really rather unique and the execution is solid. The music is pleasant (up to a certain point) and the graphics while being simple have a certain charm to them. The premise of the game is simply to build a garden/farm and harvest the crops. To do that you get little blue helper blobs that automate the process and have to fend off meanies that want to steal your crops. Otherwise it's the same 'click on something to get money' routine.By gaining more money you level up and get access to more plants (and some animals). You also have to extend your garden to have more space to grow more plants. Alternatively you can also spend money on some extras like scarecrows, guard dogs or a permanent gold multiplicator. One rather 'unfortunate' update that you can buy that way is the time that your blue helper blobs will work while being offline. It's a bit like the game knows that it doesn't offer much and artificially makes you come back to it more frequently until you threw enough money at an otherwise completely pointless update...The real problem of the game is the lack of variety. There are three categories of plants with five plants in them each and four animals that you can get. You unlock the lot within the first hour of play and afterwards you just deal with more of the same. There's one (overused) 'easter egg/cameo' special event, but there are no other specials to see or look forward to. The game play is bland even for a clicker. There no strategy or tactic at all. It's just waiting to get enough money to buy more things to get more money.It's a nice idea, but it's worth a dollar at best. You'll get an hour or two of fun out of the game until it becomes utterly repetitive.P.S.: I'm grinding for the last achievements that's why I have way more than two hours playtime, but I don't recommend doing the same."

I played a lot of them and I like when the game starts simple and as you play you unlock a whole ton of new features and mechanics so the game doesn't become repetitive and slowly turns into a complex game where you still have something to look forward to.The start of PlanetaraAt first I liked everything about this game especially the awesome music, cute graphic design and also the simple mechanics. Everything was perfect for me and  I was really happy about this game. I was really excited what this game has to offer.Getting repetitiveBut I was relly sad to discover that  after 3 hours of idle/active gameplay I still had the same features that were there from the beginning, well to be fair there were actually some new things but only 3 and they weren't even exciting at all, I am talking about: Offline time upgrade, Dogs and Coin multiplier. So because I still had the same things to work with and nothing new to unlock after lvl 20 (that's when you have all the plants and trees unlocked and they just get upgraded as you level up) It started being just repeating the same thing over and over (Plant some plants --> Idle a bit --> Plant some plants etc.) without any goal. So it kinda just developed into the classic watch the number and size of the farm grow.What does it need for me?So I really hope the authors will update this game and start adding new features to it. I don't know how it works on steam but I hope I won't be in a form of DLC or even worse if the game just gets left in it's current state. I really think this game has the potential to be one of the best, but unless it gets a lot of new features it won't cut it for me.ConclusionPersonally in the end I liked only the music and graphic, but as I read other reviews I think that people that haven't dived too deeply into the clicker/incremental games in general can really enjoy this game as well as casual people who like to relax and watch their creation grow in size."

A great majority of my time is just having it run in the background (like while I write this review). A good clicker game baits you in and gets you playing, like in the later stages ofAdVenture Capitalist. Its fun, none-the-less.The only caveat to my review is that you should know that I don't play free games (other than AdVenture Capitalist), so I can't compare to any of those.Three bucks is so little, that I am going to give this a thumb's up. Its polished and gave meat leastan afternoon of entertainment.Pros:+Cute graphics+Plays in the background+New mechanic of baiting you back - you purchase an upgrade for how many hours it will play before it stop and you need to come back to collect or production shuts downCons:-There is not enough dragging me into the game - I just need to let it run in the background after the first 2 or 3 hours of playing actively (I get that this is the basic premise, but it needs tweaking IMO)-Too simple like most clicker games; this could do with some complexity (seeIdle Civilizationfor how this can be done)-Music is great, but very repetitive-Could do with a lot more content if it is going to be so simple (I know they are still adding, so good on them)Nothing new here, but it is still a good deal of fun for three bucks."

,Recommended,421040,20886460,"Posted: 31 January, 2016",all,Lady Dawn (NeedtoKnow Gaming),"Plantera feels, in many ways, like an iOS port--but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's a clicker game, for sure, but it goes a bit deeper than that..Premise.This is your garden (though I suppose farm is more accurate). You put down crops and the only thing you need to do to take care of them is sit and watch. That's it. You can harvest fruit, vegetables, and various things from your livestock, as well as shoo off wild animals, but that's all option.You could ""play"" this game by doing nothing more than plopping down plants and animals when you've got the coin for it, because you have Helpers who do everything else for you. Albeit, slowly. It's very simplistic..Gameplay.You can do everything I mentioned above with a click of your mouse. There's no need for your keyboard here.-You level up as your Helpers (or you) gather from your garden and it's denizens. In the typical iOS game style, you can buy little powerups with in-game coin that extend the amount of time your Helpers work when you're logged out and the coin multiplier for your profits.-You can also buy little, panting canines that bark at garden invaders and scare them off. These pests will disrupt your animals or steal your crops, but are otherwise harmless. The leveliling up allows you to buy new crops and livestock and, since the catalogue is rather limited, once you unlock everything (There's five options for small plants, bushes, trees, and four for animals) levels add stars to what you already own, therefore making them worth more.-You can also expand your land, allowing for more Helpers, plants, and animals. Your little garden can get very cluttered, very quickly.-You can't see your entire garden on-screen at once after you start expanding. You can click-drag to pan or use the arrow keys.The UI is a little wonky when it comes to selecting plants: they are each on three different planes, one behind the other, and sometimes it's hard to choose something on the first plane. After you start expanding your garden and levelling up, there's a TON of stuff on-screen at all times, but I've never experienced any sort of frame rate issue..Atmosphere.I'm a sucker for cute, cartoony graphics, so this is right up my alley.The soundtrack is my one complaint. It's the same song looped over and over again. It was charming at first, but it begins to wear on you quite quickly..Longevity.At about 5 hours in, I'm level 55. Not sure what the level cap is. That being said, there was a patch released today that added 8 more in-game achievements and that's a definite thumbs up for me. I'm glad the devs are still adding on to this game because I enjoy it a lot..Bottom line.Absolutely adorable. It's a relaxing game that you can play for a few minutes or even hours. It's worth the 2.99 original price tag, but getting it on sale would be even sweeter."

For $2.99 there really isn't much on offer that can't be found in a similar free title. The game feels incomplete and a quick browse of other titles from this developer suggests that is a trend in their games.The plants and animals in Plantera can be unlocked within the first two hours of gameplay. All that remains beyond that point appears to be grinding achievements. Gameplay consists of planting an orchard and collecting gold by clicking on fruit, or by idling the game to allow workers to collect it automatically. The garden can be expanded but continues to get filled with the same plants and animals. It would have been nice to more fleshed out gameplay. Perhaps a greater number of units, or the addition of quests/daily goals to achieve.If you like clicker games and have exhausted the rest, or you're looking for easy achieves, you could probably do worse than Plantera. If you're looking for a worthwhile experience it would be best to skip this title."

Everything goes together very nicely. The only problem is that it's mostly a quest to complete the achievements, and then there isn't much to do. The garden gets maxed out. The upside is that it doesn't require micro-transactions (I'm looking at you, Clicker Heroes, Adventure Capitalist, etc) to ""complete"" the game.The idea is to build a garden with 3 layers of plants (trees in back, bushes in the middle, and vegetables in the front) to harvest, as well as animals to get ""produce"" from, such as wool, milk, eggs, and random stuff the pigs dig up. There are various critters that will try to interrupt the farming. Wolves and foxes will scare the animals, rabbits will steal vegetables, and birds will fly away with one produce item. Obviously this has minimal impact on the overall output, and they don't really add much except something else to look at.As the garden gets bigger, and more income is collected, various items will unlock, and the plants and animals will upgrade to generate more income. More helpers will arrive with upgrades and level ups, too. Dogs can be bought to scare away pest animals, and scarecrows can be placed to scare off the birds. Helpers will gather produce for you. As your farm gets larger, there isn't really any point on clicking anything. The main task becomes replacing the lower income plants and animals with higher income ones. Land expansions are purchased to increase the size of the garden.At the start, it may be helpful to click butterflies and ladybugs (one per level for those) to get some extra money. There's also the Loot Hero that will run across the screen. Keep clicking on it to get more and more money until it runs off the edge. It also will scare off any bad critters on its way across. You can learn more about these and other features in the game Announcements.Upgrades can be purchased to collect revenue while the game is closed. However, I've found that unlike other clickers, it's way more beneficial to just leave the game open overnight. With a large farm, I'd come back on a 16h harvest upgrade to find 30M. If I left it running instead, my helpers would collect 300M. This is mostly why I have 86.6 hours on record. It's important to generate greater sums as you progress because land expansions and items continue to get more expensive.Since it doesn't require in-game purchases, and it's only $2.99, I recommend it for people that like the idle clicker games and want a bit of variety.

Hope you like my guide!(FYI, This guide still has a lot of information, but a few other guides might be better than this)So this game is basically a cute little clicker game where you buy plants, bushes, tress, and animals to make as much money as possible. You also have little helpers that pick the Fruits / Vegatables off of everything so you dont really have to. There are also things that will want to take your plants, rabbits, moles, birds, foxes, and wolfs. You can also upgrade your farm starting at 750 coins. It is also possible to pick them yourself, but who wants to do that? There is also a loot hero that comes around every so often that you can click to get a lot of gold, Loot hero can also drive away rabbits, birds, wolfs, foxes, and moles.

,Not Recommended,421040,22549414,"Posted: 21 April, 2016",all,Gaffi,"I've played a few clicker/idle type games, and this one unfortunately is lacking quite a bit. As other reviews have noted, the game is not free, whereas the majority of my experience has been with free games.That being said, there are a few I'm actively playing, with elements that keep me interested. Namely, Clicker Heroes and AdVenture Capitalist. Both have events which keep up the variety, and both have long term, difficult to reach (without a lot of play time) goals. This keeps me engaged and coming back for more.On the other hand, Plantera has very low replayability. The review panel here is telling me I've clocked just under 50 hours. That is 100% actual game time, as I did not leave the game closed for any extended period. Sure, you can do that, and get your earnings when you come back, but there are achievements that can only be obtained while having an active window open. -- And that's part of the problem. With my ~50 hours of play time, I picked up every single achievement. That might be good if you are a completionist, but it was far too easy. There were no goals that I could see taking more than a month to complete (versus the previously mentioned titles, which have achievements that take a very long time to get to), and because of that, there's not much you're going to get for your money here.Also, in the 'late game' (which is really no different than earlier stages), the building upgrades are all passive, based on your level. So on top of the fact that the game doesn't change much over time, thus making it boring, there is nearly zero strategy to employ with regard to upgrade paths. There are some strategic elements, like how many dogs/scarecrows to use, but I found these had very minimal impact, especially if you were actively clicking all the time.Now, that's not to say the game is all that bad. The animations are nice/cute, the expandable garden is a nice twist on the genre, and this game rewards active participation more than others. However, for the lack of content/total active play time provided, I would much rather have kept my money, considering the free alternatives available."

There is no challenge involved what so ever. The more you click the more resources you gain and the more you can plant which gives you more things to click. Planteria is a straight forward time sink that comes with cute graphic and joyful music. Over all Planteria works fine but it doesn't offer entertaiment for long. It takes about an hour to achieve all the unlocked items and after that there is nothing new to gain.

There are also specials you can buy like guard dogs to chase away critters, a clock that lets you earn money for a set time while being offline (although it's more profitable to leave the game running) and a multiplier which increases the worth of everything. Later on you can also expand your property so you can plant more things. It's very simple and there's not much to it yet I found it addictive.

From time to time you’ll get more of the “collecting creatures” or your plants will be promoted, so you get more gold from them.What I really liked about the game is that your garden already got very lively after only 15-20 minutes into the game.If you’re looking for a little “idle” game.

I found this game absolutely adorable~ The music is fun and bubbly, and the characters are super cute :) I think the game is balanced well, and the time to 100% it is enough to be entertaining without getting super boring like some other games.

In most other clickers, this option is automatically avalible and it doesn't matter how long you're not playing for.

You can also buy some helpers - scarecrows, dogs, etc., and as you expand the size of your garden you automatically get some helps that wander around picking up produce for you to save some clicking.As your garden develops you increase in level which gives you access to more valuable crops/livestock, although everything's cost grows exponentially in clicker game style, and as you level up earlier crops get bonus ""stars"" which increase their value, so it isn't always best to switch to the highest level option you have.Overall it is a fairly relaxing and well put together game that can keep you occupied for a couple of evenings, there isn't a lot of depth here but it is fine for the type of game it is."

There is idling, but the rabbits, wolves, foxes, birds, etc will come eat your farm.

Every time you 'Rank Up', you unlock another one of those categories' products. Once you hit rank 18 or 19, I don't remember which, you've unlocked them all. But you can still rank up after that, and once you do, each production type gains a star, indicating a higher value of production, in the order the items unlock in.There are a couple extra things in the game, but honestly I think I have proven my point.

This game would be a 100% yes for free but as a pay for clicker game I gotta give it a no.  I myself will hold onto the game for a few more days before tossing it if the devs don't show that they have MANY more things coming for the game to help draw it out.Pros: the music is lovely and if you tire of it there is a muti button for either sound or music, though sound helps you listen for bonuses and stuff going wrong.Your clicking is always rewarded, when fruit is ready to be picked you can click on it to drop early and in turn start the next fruit sooner making you money faster, as well as clicking to fend off foes giving you a reason to keep clicking in this clicker unlike so many other clicker games.Everything looks rather cute... other than your workers but still everything else looks cute in the game.NO IN GAME FEES!  I know it's unheard of and I don't know why it's not there but yes for once a clicker that doesn't look like it's trying to make it's game impossible to beat without paying 50 bucks to win, looking at you AC!The cons: Level ups don't matter very fast, what happens when you get a new level but you've unlocked everything?  Oh they double the worth of your oldest plant, meaning the first plant that got  you one gold now earns you two but seeing as you'll have plants making about five gold at that point, there is no reason to enjoy said level ups anymore as your most expensive plant will still be making more.The guard dogs, I do enjoy that we have them but they are not dependable.  You can place them anywhere you like at first but at times they may walk off the map or never simply there to defend your farm even if you have ten of them because they all thought it would be best to head left vs right.  I'm all for them having to patrol but it would be better if there was a reasonable set amount of ground for them to cover.Paying for a clicker game, Sounds stupid after the pro DLC bit I know but I myself just hate spending money on clicker games, maybe a buck or two, heck the 2.39 sale may yet have me keep it.  I just never feel it's right to pay for games like these.#1 problem!  It's too short.  In this small amount of time you see logged, 1.3 hours at the time of posting, I've more than beaten the game.  Everything is unlocked I'm getting stars for my plants already and there is nothing to do other then check in every 11 hours or so now simply because of another con, you have to, in game, pay for how long you can be offline and still make money.(I could be misunderstanding that but it sounds like that's what it is.)Final verdict: I said it at the start I'll say it again this is not a yes review it's not a no review it's a middle of the road one.  This game just was released so I'm VERY hopeful that the game will fix it's largest problem, in which I'll be changing it to a yes review but till then it's a no.  Come on guys it's a clicker game with plant life I know you can find more fruits to add in, prep a valentines thing where you have to click flying babies, or even blue babies like your workers, away much like the crows.  I understand it's a better more complex interface than AC but it's still a clicker game you can give us a reason to push us to septillion other then achievements.*AC is another clicker game that I will not name as they are getting enough mud slung at them for poor choices in uploads right now."

I'm happy to pay for the games. As it stands now, this game is not a strong contender in these genres. It does not compare strongly against similar games.After maybe 30 minutes tops of active play and a few hours of idling, it looks like I've seen everything there is to see. There are a lot of achievements for longer play, but the gameplay and content just aren't in place to make that remotely interesting to me.What's there is well polished. The graphics are decent, the sound is decent. The UI is decent, controls and interacting work just dandy, and the game runs well windowed. It is cute, and it could be a good game for relaxing. On those technical aspects, there aren't any problems. Most of the foundation for a great simple game is in place.Ultimately, the problem is thatthere just isn't enough here. There is never any kind of ""paradigm shift"" that would help the longevity, or really even any strategy at all. You just plant the best things you have available.(If you aren't familiar with incremental games, this may be how all these games look to you. The difference is that better incremental games tend to give you more opportunity to make strategic decisions and strive for optimal play over a longer period of time -- choosing the buildings that give the best points per second for the cost, choosing when to prestige, etc. Plantera lets you make some small choices about what to plant, but ultimately those choices are inconsequential, because the game is so extremely short on content.)I'd recommend buying the game at a price that you find reasonable for30 minutes of playtime. There are trading cards, so that could influence your decision."

I tried this one because it had positive feedback and I haven't tried one for a long time.

Maybe it would be more satisfying if this had more plantable options to unlock or something unexpected happening from time to time. Or maybe there is and I just haven't playd to reach that point. Somehow this doesn't hook me that I would want to continue clicking and hope for the best.There is nothing wrong with the game art, sounds or music, except it is not that original in any way in my opinion. Meaning that this doesn't make me want to keep the game running because it's relaxing to look at, funny, creepy or somehow interesting.

The limitations on the game set by the dev (or incompetent game design) are just rediculous for an auto game. And therefore I simply can not recommend it.""The long, everyone is gonna disagree version.It's a fun, charming, super cheap game and for that it's probably worth the money. And the music is nice. Shame the soundtrack (like 1 song as far as I can tell from playing the game) is $5, and it has more content than the actual game.But at the end of the day, it's even less of a clicker game, than clicker games.Examples:Your idle money caps out when the computer is off- you have an actual max money count, and going over that means you stop gaining anything.The amount of content is extremely low.There's almost no need to click outside of speeding up the early game. The rest is just letting it run on your computer in the background. Don't minimize it because it pauses the game. The game runs at half speed when not the active window.The upgrades are basically pointless. Some to allow you to gain more money when the game is closed (except if you hit the cap none of it matters, and the cap is 100mil offline-money, and upgrades max out at 99mil a click, so you see the issue). There's a multiplier to get more money from each thing globally (click or not) but again, your max money cap is still a thing when the game is closed, AND there's still an in-game cap, so all this does it help you reach it marginally faster. 2x faster exactly. Which, isn't really noticable until you have 200x the money, 250, 300 etc. But it's still not SUPER fast by any means.This game got boring, fast. The limitations on the game set by the dev (or incompetent game design) are just rediculous for an auto game. And therefore I simply can not recommend it."

It has very cutesy graphics, the music is wonderful, if a little loud. There isn't an option to lower the music, I don't think - just mute it altogether.It's too harsh of a clicker, though. If you want to do things yourself, you need to click once to harvest the fruit of the plant, and then a second time to pick it up for gold. Things regrow insanely quickly, so you end up with a ton of fruits and such on the ground, turning into massive piles. The helpers are slow and you'll never have enough of them.All that being said, it's a cute, relaxing time-waster. I play for 10 minutes, then quit. Check back a few hours, I'm filthy rich! There's not much content - like others have said, everything is unlocked after level 20. Less than 1 full hour of gameplay, and I've unclocked everything.Still, it's a cute game, even if my hand does hurt after 2 minutes of harvesting my garden. Definitely worth the ~2 USD, if you like little farms and animals."

I'm really not one for clicker games but this one is surprisingly addictive and not as mind-numbing as a lot of other ones out on Steam. No microtransactions, so that's always a plus. It could also easily be expanded in the future to include more customizations and animals, etc.My only complaints are that it gets a bit repetitive after the initial unlocks and there's not much else to look forward to or work towards after that, that's why I think some more things need to be added eventually to keep people playing after the first few hours. The other complaint is that there is a small spelling error on the ""welcome back"" screen in the English version.Overall it's definitely worth giving it a shot at such a low price point even if clicker games aren't your favourites."

( mine all like to hang out together at the center of the map so i have a literal mountain of crops that havent been harvested(gosh darn cherry trees)) otherwise its a fantasticly deceptive game that is great.though i did buy it on sale i would still recommend this game so long as it remains under $10

The premise of clicker games are simple enough but Plantera mixes the simplicity of clicker games with a bit of strategy. As there is limited amounts of things to keep track of that all get out of hand quite eaisly as there is a limit on how much you can build until you expand and when to expand. Sure expanding gives you more gold but takes you a lot longer to fill your land up with the high tier money makers. Tier 1-2 money makers may overlap but the gap between Tier 1-5 is so huge that you sometimes want to save. My advice is always max out on land and slowely remove the low income tiers. Really fun

You can go offline and your farmers will continue to harvest resources for cash based on certain upgrades.  You can't go offline indefinately like every other idle game.  Initially, you have 1h of offline resource gathering but this can be upgraded for very little money.The trick initially is to expand as quickly as possible, which nets you more helpers to collect resources.  You'll obviously make more money clicking yourself but if you are lazy like me, you'll just minimize the game and do something else.But the game has a certain addiction to it.  You just want that one more upgrade or click and the music makes the game a happy experience.  Seriously, if you're having a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ day, just listen to the soundtrack for 15 minutes."

I would have to leave a note to remind myself of the near perfect game to bother.But I digress... The actual income rates of anything you are supposed to build are pointlessly low. So this turns the game into - ""wait for the shameless plug for another game to run across the screen.""I will perfect game this soon and then uninstall. Funny part for me is that once I ran out of things to do the first night... I took a <2 hour break and went a perfect gamed loot hero dx which I had never heard of.

Cute graphics and pleasant music, but as other reviews have mentioned after the first five minutes you're bored. This is where the workers really come in, while you're not playing it(I recommened just closing out, not leaving it in the background) your blue fellas are making money for you. So when you're ready to play the game again(I once had a month hiatus from it) you've got a bunch of money! But keep in mind how long they'll work for. You can upgrade their length of working hours to make it possible to avoid the game for longer.It is easier to enjoy the game when you're closer to 100% achievements, and if you're truly bored just sell everything and redo what your garden looks like. That's always fun for 15 minutes.Basically this is a game that you'd have the same attention span for as if it was a facebook game. It's enjoyable and cute, but not meant to take up your entire time.

After a while, you see nothing but acres and acres of the same crap going on endlessly.  The map can only scroll left and right.  There's no zoom, so you're pretty much limited in exploring the map with your left and right arrow.  As a result, you just keep scrolling and scrolling.  The more you expand your farm, the more you have to keep scrolling eventually.  If you want something like limiting the map to only farm animals, you still need to buy more and more land to raise the # of animals your allowed.The game is a hit the first few times you play it, but after the hype is gone the end game is just not up there like it was in the beginning.

There is next to no challenge what so ever and it tops off pretty early, You can pretty much reach end game in less than 12 hours then it is just a matter of expanding the area and populating it with the limited amount of upgrades. I bought this just because I enjoy clicker style games but this one should be called a Clicker Activity rather than a game. I would recommend it as a childs game. It could give a young child something to occupy time but they would even get bored rather fast. This does have a sort of relaxing charm to it just by popping vegetables out of holes or picking the fruit but the upgrades really need to be extended to give more substance to Plantera. For the price it is not bad and does have its limited appeal. One thing that would make the game a bit better would be to just make it a mouseover game so you dont have to consistently click, just mouseover the items to drop them to the ground then mouseover again to collect in one swoop. This type of game would also highly benefit from being modable allowing players to further extend the game and upgrades available.

,Recommended,421040,20919529,"Posted: 2 February, 2016",all,Caseman27,"Welcome to Plantera, and not to be confused by the Terraria boss, because this game has nothing to do with that.Ok for the review:Plantera is a ""click-a-thon"" game, where you own a farm of your own, and grow fruits and vegetables. Once they are grown, you click on them to collect them, and you get money to buy more crops for more money. There are 3 types of plants you can have (currently): Trees, bushes, and crops. The 3 types just produce different foods, with not much difference. There are also animals you can have, including (so far) chickens, pigs, cows, and sheep. (as well as a dog, but that works differently.) The animals also produce stuff for even more money. You are not alone however, because there are these blue helpers that, hence the name, help you collect the crops, even when you are not playin! Because the helpers also work when you are not playing, means that Plantera has a phone game sometimes, where you play the game in short periods, and come back every now and then.Note that Plantera doesn't have an end to it, and there's no objective to the game. You can also unlock everything the game has so far in under an hour, so that might put people off on that one.The game is for casual people who want to play a game that relieves stress. In my opinion, the way to get more enjoyment is to acheivement hunt this game. (meaning getting all of the acheivements.)Finally, if that last part sounded negative towards this game, theres this that might change your mind about it. The game is in early acess, and is being worked on a lot. It seems like the people who made this game are working, and releasing new, but small things every week. With the $2 cost, it seems overpriced, but if it get more updates, I think it's worth it, or if there's a price drop.I give it an 8/10 (right now)"

76561198056607636,Recommended,421040,25472045,"Posted: 11 September, 2016",all,Jan Quadrant Vincent 16,"IntroIf you enjoy the idle clicker genre that has been exploding almost exponentially this should definitely be a staple in your library.You could probably spend the majority of the time scrolling left to right back and forth all day dropping all the tree based plants while collecting the butterflies and still get some enjoyment rapidly increasing your profits. And that's less than 1/4 of the game.GameplayYou're put in control of a 2D space to plant fruits, vegetables, and ""manage"" farm animals. You start with a relatively small plot and work your way up. For such a simple looking game, it really isn't but not in a bad way. You have ground based plants, shrub/bush level plants, trees, animals, butterflies, ladybugs, and random encounter enemy animals who try to snatch your precious goods out from under your nose (magpies, rabbits, etc.). This is a lot going on when you have 30 or more plants spread out across your land each producing 2-5 crops each. Luckily you are able to purchase upgrades to your away collection time, a coin multiplier that keeps the game functioning, guard dogs to scare off the ground vermin, and scarecrows to deter those no-good magpies. This isn't the typical min max idler either. The game keeps all the crops relevant through a star system which increases the value received from each crop.End gameYour definition and mine may be different but after a few hours in I'm starting to see crops stacking up in spots that are a few crops high. Don't know what this will mean going forward, hopefully our little blue blob buds can keep up with the help of dogs and scarecrows keeping theives at bay.*One key thing I would like to note: the game doesn't have to be a race to the neverending finish line if you don't want it to be. Reap the satisfaction that somebody probably started a week before you and is a couple of hundred hours ahead of you playing at near max potential (potentially with some script it took an hour to set up properly) and there's someone who started 10 minutes ago and is level 4 happily clicking away at the 5 wide plot they own. You're never going to ""beat"" the game so trying to makes about as much sense as chasing a Bugati or [insert fancy car brand here] with an infinite supply of gas across the continental US.Pros+ Addicting to those who enjoy any other idle clicking game+ Multiple tiered levels leaving you to click like a lunatic to maximize your profits or don't, the game leaves this completely up to you+ The GUI won't be pushing your cpu or gpu to the limit, it's what you would expect from a game that costs about as much as a 2 liter of your favorite drink (or less)+ The UI. It may not be much but it gives you enough detail to make decisions on which plant to purchase next. In the long run it may not seem like much but if you like your plants segmented into sections that match or are in a pattern it helps to know how many of each you currently own.+ NO MICROTRANSACTIONS. Enough said... You're not going to come home to find out your kid charged $12k to your credit cards on virtual gems, coins, or whatever bs form of pay to win you enjoy (or don't) and not be able to refund them. You also won't feel the need to drop $1 or $5 into it to get that fraction of an increase to your margains.Cons- The only gripe I have after a couple hours of managing, leaving, and coming back is the limit on workers and their positioning on the map. Currently there isn't an option to buy more outside of expanding your plot. The game could also use a zoom feature and potentially a system to move the blobs to specific areas.

I don't know, but I believe the target audience is young children or maybe senior citizens.  It's really not meant for the teenage/college-age Steam crowd that enjoys fun stuff like sex and violence and PvP.  Some clicker games you can 'lose,' or at least reach a boss leve you can't yet beat without grinding; other games like Adventure Capitalist have no way to lose so long as you keep putting time into them: this is one of those games, where all that is required is time, more time, lots more time, and effort.It's a game that I wish we had a yellow stop light for, as it's not a thumbs-up or thumbs-down situation, but right in the middle.  I almost refunded it; I was torn and on the fence, but the lack of micro-transactions and lack of cash-grabs convinced me that this was just some truly indie game; eventually it grew on me.  Because it's sugar sweet.  But is 'sweet' the same as 'fun'?  Depends on your age...  So, if you're an old guy like me, then thumbs up, get this on sale when it's $0.99 or $1.49, and you will find it a fun little casual moment of relaxation.

Some people might say it's not worth the money but I disagree. Most of the idlers/clickers on iPhone are F2P and will purposefully nag you to buy stuff. Plantera is the clicker I've always dreamed of. For just a small entry fee, you can watch your gold increase, watch your animals hang out, pick which crops you want, and click on stuff. No ads, no microtransations, no distractions. The art style is adorable, too.HOWEVER, there are a couple of things that need to be improved.First of all, I think the game should use a different mouse. At least on my computer it uses the default black and white one. It's very easy to lose where the mouse is on the screen because it's so small. I think that adding a simple, cartoony mouse would really improve the game.In addition, there need to be more upgrades. I haven't even gotten to 100k yet (although I might when I get home and get whatever gold has acrued) and I have all the crops available. This might be because I was actively playing the game for a lot of the time, but still. If everything is unlocked by around level 20, what do you do from 21-100? I don't actually remember what level you get the last upgrade at, I'm just guessing. So, there need to be a ton more upgrades. You could even create random, exotic crops. Purple, blue, and orange trees would be crazy and awesome. Just keep updating with more crops and I will definitely keep playing. Thank you for making this game!"

,Recommended,421040,33419385,Posted: 9 July,all,Festive,"Plantera ReviewPlantera is a clicker game where you plant a variety of trees, bushes, and crops to collect gold and plant more. Throughout the game, various animals come to steal the crops, which means setting aside some gold for upgrades like scarecrows or dogs.It's pretty standard of a clicker game. In fact, it might be a little less substantial than other clicker games, but the adorable style and involvement the game offers is unrivaled. From other clicker games that I've played, it almost wants you to be away from your computer. Which is totally understandable, but Plantera gives you reasons to stick around.You could click on the various animals that come to steal your things, tap fruit on the trees so that it falls down quicker, and even click the magificent Loot Knight that runs across your screen from time-to-time! If you are active, you'll probably find yourself constantly upgrading your garden with better trees and increasing their plot size.The only problem that you'll find is that the game goes by incredibly quick. Hence the reason why I said it is much less substantial than other clicker games. Somehow, the world feels rather... lonely. Once you get the upgrades, there is very little use to stick around, save for watching your wallet grow bigger. Without any thing to by, however, it becomes quickly underwhelming.It would be awesome if they added more crops, but maybe some cosmetic items for your little helpers as a gold-sink. Maybe allow you to plant in different biomes with varying degrees of upgrades and infrastructure. It would also be nice to have a statistics page so I can see how much of my pathetic existence I spent clicking virtual plums!Overall, I'd consider this game worth the three dollars it is marked at currently. It's a cute clicker game that's a bit rough around the edges. If the developers keep on expanding, this game could be one of the best around!"

The unlockables last for maybe an hour or less, and then all of a sudden, you realize there's no new plants, animals, trees, or bushes to buy (Yes, there are only four main categories of objects plus some incidental items).  This game failed me as a clicker because there is no real reward to keep me clicking on the screen after 20 minutes or so of play.  If you read through the reviews, a lot of people leave the game on in the background and just check in periodically to get money.  The game controls are a bit clunky for me (editing your garden takes two steps, limited options for scrolling through your guardedn, etc).  The graphics and music are cute, but repetitive."

This helps the endgame, or at least those last few achievements, feel reachable.  But there is also a cap on overnight earnings just over the price cap. So still not quickly reachable.  ;-)Plantera is about the price and sophistication of a mobile game, and about as quick.  You're raising a garden of various plants and upgrades.  You quickly earn a cute round blue helper.  After that, you don't really need to keep clicking on the game, unless you want to get the various achievements.  More helpers come with levels you earn and new land expansions.In your first couple of days running Plantera, you'll have unlocked all the plants and upgrades you'll get, aside from land expansions that have to be bought, and will know if you want to continue to pursue the remaining achievements and max out the game.One nice touch is that, despite being well over level 100 now, I am still earning star upgrades for those plants, which increase the coins you earn from them.  One of the upgrades also multiplies the coins you earn.Plants fit only into preset slots in various game engine layers.  Trees in the back, bushes in the foreground, ground crops in the front.  But you can put plants in any relevant slot that's open, so you can easily have little fams and orchards of the different plants.  Or you can go for the top-paying plants in each layer to churn out the coinage.There's critters that will steal your produce, but also guardian upgrades such as scarecrows and doggies to scare them off.My only complaint is that offline XP earnings stop at the first level you earned off line.  At least those levels do come fast while the game is open, so this is a very minor complaint."

,Not Recommended,421040,35503287,Posted: 5 October,all,OK,"Too shallow even for an idle clicker game.Clicker games should be designed to scale numbers exponentially while drip-feeding you content. This game dumps what little content there is within an hour of idle time, and progress is very linear.Looks cute though, but it feels more like an atmospheric design experiment rather than a game."
