I play through the games and then 'read' them on my laptop as 'bed time' stories with the kids. The lack of dialogue encourages the kids to create their own description of the action. It's a treat to listen to them tell what they see as they see it through the eyes of children and not my tired old eyes.I have STEAM accounts for all three of the kids families so Iwill be buying this game three more times and it's well worth the money.I solved the four- card game to get the jack knife. That clever puzzle will really entertain the kids.Amanita Designs is one of my favorite studios so I hope they sell  million copies of this game so I can look forward to their next product. And take your time Amanita as the kids love to go through these games numerous times!Even if you don't have grand kids to share this game with GET IT!"

That game captured my imagination and left a very happy stamp in my mind. It was only many years later, when I found out about Machinarium and suddenly I realized it had to be the same developer, that I realized the game was in fact Samorost - that bizzare game I really liked.One can only imagine how stoked I was when I found out Samorost 3 is coming out. 30 minutes of playing have already taken me back to those places of mystery I frequented as a child. It feels as if I am reliving my earliest years.Samorost 3 is 7 times more vibrant and beautiful, and mystical, than its incredible predecessors. It's filled with fantastic imagery, beautiful scenes, vibrant soundtrack, peculiar story, and original and unique mechanics.I just want to thank Amanita Design for their originality and loyalism to such a unique genre, in the ever changing environment - that is the video games scene in general. Thank you for such a creative and thought provoking world, and for such a fantastic, amazingly produced game.If you liked Machinarium or played Samorost as a child like myself, or hell, just like games that see beyond the horizon, there is no reason you won't like Samorost 3, for it excels in what it does - portray a world the wildest of minds wouldn't be able to think of. I think the price is more than fair considering the amount of love this game got and how carefully and warmly it was handled by its developers. Thank you for a once in a life time experience."

A new Samorost game? A full length one? AND with 2016 quality? Samorost and I go way back, as Samorost 2 was a huge part in my childhood, as strange as it may seem. My family and I used to sit together trying to solve the puzzles, and back then, it was so much fun. When AD released Botanicula (which was awesome) and called it their last game, I was nearly heartbroken. Samorost 3, not only announced the revival of Amanita Design (for me at least), but also a continuation of a nostalgic experience of mine... I couldn't ask for anything better from AD. Now, it may seem like I love this game because of it's predecessors, but It's not true by any stretch. Samorost 3 is a beautiful, simple enough game with a charm unlike I have ever seen. I know some are reluctant to buy it due to it's cost, but believe me, it's highly worth it. I realy hope Amanita Design continues to thrive and produce those amazing experiences, and I truly believe they will finally get their well deserved recognition after Smorost 3."
,Recommended,421120,31929082,Posted: 23 May,all,krayzkrok,"A beautiful and magical experience from Amanita Design. They are incapable of making a bad game, and Samarost 3 is probably their best one yet. It's a gentle, non-violent and playful game of exploration, wonder and puzzle solving, starring an inquisitive little gnome who wanders wide-eyed (or so it seems) around imaginatively-designed little planetoids that are full of eclectic life. It's cartoon realism, and all the better for it. Everything is infused with so much character, from little incidental details to the tiny animals that scurry around and make curious squeaking noises if you try and interact with them. There's such an innocent sense of humour running through the entire game, it's the perfect escape from the world.Although the artwork is stunning - I'd describe it as photorealistically unrealistic - music infuses the entire game. Much of the time you interact with the world using a flute, prompted by a visual cue that appears as you explore or solve puzzles. The world responds both visually and musically, with Floex again supplying the tunes. His work on Machinarium was great, but here it's even more closely integrated into the game. The first time you're rewarded with music after solving a puzzle, and you see the timeless reaction from your little gnome, you're almost guarnateed a huge grin. The puzzles range from fairly easy to those requiring a bit of logical deduction, but all of them felt quite logical. There's a bit of to- and fro-ing required at one point, which could have benefited from a short-cut, but it never felt like a drag.The game ran for 7 hours, although at least an hour of that was revisiting puzzles to hear the music once more! Once you finish the game, the world doesn't go away. Instead you're given the means to roam freely around the places you've visited, and perhaps try and figure out all the achievements (all of which involve finding ways of interacting with creatures and objects).If you want more joy in your life, Samarost 3 is highly recommended."

I think to see the desires and histories of Items. I really like puzzles in this game. I'm not a huge fan of old, or oldschool type of P&C puzzles. You know, hundreds of items in your inventory and trying to use everything on everything. Puzzles are mostly based around some levers (but those are really creatively done!), sounds etc.Asthetically, it's totally amazing. It has really great quality in terms of visuals, but also whole artstyle is beautiful, just look at the screenshots, design of places is wierd and it gives really great charm to it. It's also cute at some moments, especially with protagonist voice. Locations are also pretty interactive.Sound is really good, whole game is kinda based around sounds and it's doing great job. Music is just amazing, Floex nailed it again!For storyline, it's simple, it's nothing really deep, but it's doing it's job. It's just a little story with cute protagonist, I have nothing against it.Overall It's really great game if you look for casual P&C game with great and wierd design and amazing audiovisuals.It's pretty short (probably will take you like 4-6 hours), but definetly worth the money."
,Recommended,421120,34201640,Posted: 12 August,all,alphyna,"This is a game about tiny things that has a big heart.Samorost 3is also about music, kindness, and quiet attention. Honestly, calling it a puzzle game is somewhat of an overstatement, because the puzzles are often illogical (like, say, to have a bunch of imps brew a bomb for you, you need to make them sing in sync... which obviously has nothing to do with brewing). It's more like an interactive screensaver, a meditation that throws a screen full ofthingsat you and suggests you just mess with them somewhat randomly.So you get to ride hairy asteroids, pluck moths' antennae, feed giant anteaters, climb termitary holes, and so much more. The plot is rudimentary; this is the story of a gnome-like guy who is attentive enough to hear the music hidden from mundane ears—and when he reproduces it with his small trumpet, magic happens.Turns out the world is eager to be witnessed—you just need to know how to look.This must have also been the philosophy that went into making the game. It's precisely due to the creators' shrewd and kind way of looking at things that the numerous creatures they've made turned out so lovely. They're not cute in an exaggerated way! But you're made to care for them due to how well their mannerisms are reproduced or lovingly exaggerated, like a dog making several circles in place before going to sleep, a chamois being tender and easily frightened like an insect, or a nuthatch being Determined Like An Arrow.The collage-like visuals are impeccable, and the sound design is simply incredible, with many ambient actions seemingly voiced by human voices, which adds to the atmosphere of a fairy tale being told. And, on top of all that,Samorost 3is also aesthetically original and does not really rely on overused tropes.A gem, all in all."

,Recommended,421120,34361677,Posted: 19 August,all,ᑎiᖴTყ,"This is one of the best feeling games I’ve played in a while. It just really brings a unique and lovely feel in an industry filled with AAA titles and games that just don’t feel like they were really cared for and used only as a money-making tool. This game feels like the devs put in the time and decided they would rather have a wonderful game than something that would be more marketable. Now I’ll start the main part of the review.The sounds and music in this game are some of the best I’ve seen. First the soundtrack really draws you in and makes the game 100% more enjoyable. The devs also spared nothing when it comes to ""voice acting"" and sound effects. They give the characters life and a kind of mystery as well as creating a magical environment. This and the music really make the feel of the game much more relaxed and interesting. Most or every creature and ""person"" (if you can call them that) has something to say when it/they are interacted with, creating an in-depth environment that draws you in and makes you feel like a part of the little world.Now we move into the art style of the game. First if you don’t enjoy this art you’re not going to enjoy the game nearly as much as it can be enjoyed. With that out of the way I’ll go into my opinion (because I know how much you wana hear it). I personally love the art and the characters wouldn’t be nearly as charming without the beautiful design of the game. Every area seems like a moving and living photo that you can interact with and traverse. The creatures of the game also have a very interesting look and will usually stand out from the terrain but not to a point where they look out of place. In fact, most of the creature’s match flawlessly with the place that they dwell and have a fitting ""personality"" for what they look like and where they live.Ireally love the art and it is really a key part of the game as I see it.The puzzle aspect of this game is somewhat lacking as most of the time they are very easy or do not have anything to do with the story or the situation. None the less they can be a lovely way to spend time and the music and art makes it so that it does not seem like your grinding. I would recommend using a guide or walkthrough to help if you’re stuck but that’s up to you and how much you want to do the game on your own. I will leave a few links to good guides and videos down below if you are looking for help.In all this is a wonderful game and I think it brings a type of play to the table that is very refreshing and magical. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested in the art and music/sound effects of the game. I picked it up on sale for around $10 or maybe $7 USD and don’t regret one penny. I hoped this review helped you and gave you an idea of what this game entails.Here are a few links for helping you get all those achievements and just winding your way through the game in general.walkthroughshttps://youtu.be/RNCJqbq819Ahttp://www.ign.com/wikis/samorost-3/Walkthroughotherhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=651760113https://youtu.be/Kx14K5MjxB8"

Amanita does the best adventure games in the world, period, and this masterpiece continues the tradition.Though I have to admit I was little let down about the length of Samorost 3. The game is too short for my expectations, especially compared to Machinarium and the bigger price tag. The world sucks you in and you'd want to see more. It ends kinda hastily which let little sad feeling about the ending."

So naturally, I was pretty excited for Samorost 3.After playing through it completely, I'd say that Samorost 3 is certainly a good game in its own right, but I didn't enjoy it as much as Amanita's other full-length games.Pros:- Gorgeous, detailed art- Great soundtrack- Several diverse, interesting worlds to explore- Some creative puzzles (such as the one with the animated cards)Cons:- Not very long, with no real replay value- Though most puzzles were fine, I found a couple of them to be a bit too obtuse. I got stuck at least once towards the end because it wasn't intuitive how to interact with a puzzle.- No clear reward for finding all 30 of the hidden ""sounds"" (for lack of a better name)- It wasn't clear to me at first which menu option was ""save game"" and which was ""load game"" due to the developer's decision to not use any words, and as a result I accidentally lost my first couple minutes of progress by selecting the wrong option.Like with many Amanita games, the story for Samorost 3 isn't particularly complex, but I appreciate how you uncovered more of it as you played rather than having it all spelled out at the start.Samorost 3 also uses some of my favorite elements and details from Botanicula and Machinarium. Most notably, it took its own version of the ""critter cards"" from Botanicula, where interacting with various critters and objects in the world gave you a little collectible card for them. Samorost 3 also has several situations in which your character performs an endearing little dance to music played by NPCs (which was one of my favorite little details of Machinarium).I personally didn't find Samorost 3 to be quite as charming or enjoyable as Machinarium or Botanicula. I think this was mainly because I found the story to be more difficult to get invested in and the characters to be less quirky and interesting than those of prior games.Don't get me wrong, though, it's still a good game and worth purchasing (especially on sale). I just don't think it is Amanita's best.I figured I should also note that I also stumbled across two minor glitches, but nothing gamebreaking:- The tea brewer inexplicably repeated the animation for putting the mandrake into the kettle, even after completing the action once.- Sometimes, I would lose the ability to walk after heading back down the staircase with a trapdoor in the tower atop the Monk World. Reloading the save restored normal movement."

I ended up going back and forth quite a bit and the walk times, though fairly short, still add up."

When I finally played and finished it, it left me a tad bit dissapointedRight off the bat, I instantly fell in love with the presentation. Like Amanita Design's previous games, the world is weird and wonderful, with all of the vibrant colours and impressive locations. The world is constantly full of life and energy; often at times, I just stared out into the distance and saw weird creatures in the background and observing their behaviours, and each time doing so felt like observing strange animals in David Attenborough documentaries. It is not hard to fall in love with the off-beat world of Samorost 3. The atmosphere is pushed forward with the beautiful score by Tomas Dvorak, the same composer for the music from Samorost 2 and Machinarium. The sound design, much like Amanita design's previous entry, Botanicula, is very bizzare and maybe even out of place at times, but that made the world even more weird and charming. The presentation is definitely where Samorost 3 really shines.The gameplay is pretty much what you would expect from a point-click adventure game. You explore a world by clicking on where you want your little gnome character to go, and solving devilishly hard puzzles. The puzzles, while cool, can be a bit vague and frustrating at times. There is sometimes some tedious backtracking, such as when going back and forth lond distances in order to solve a complicated puzzle. The hint system isn't much of a help either; it looks very vague and even looks more like a complicated scientific calculation than a walkthrough, due to all of the arrows going in precievably random places and the fact they tell you exactly what to do in a very complicated order. There are collectables, which will involve your little character to find sound vibrations using your trusty golden trumpet, which is sometimes used in the main game. They are surprisingly fun and rewarding to collect, which would make for something fun to come back to after you finish the main game. Overall, I liked the gameplay, despite there being some nit-picks and flaws that are hard to ignore here and there.VERDICT:While Samorost 3 is one of Amanita Design's weaker games, Samorost 3 is still a unique, wacky, and gorgeous world that deserves to be experiences by puzzle lovers young and old.PROS:+ Amazing art and sound+ Beautiful Score+ Colourful and surreal+ Fun collectablesCONS:- Can be frustating at times- Some backtracking- Poor hint system8.0/10It would be better to get this game when it is on sale.

So is Samorost 3, and this time it's a bit of a problem.Their previous major games, ""Machinarium"" and ""Botanicula,"" have fantastic puzzles, beautiful art, and charming gameplay.  Samorost 3 has charm and gorgeous art, but the puzzles are mostly guess-and-test.  There are a couple good ones in here, but most of them don't require much thought, and the remaining can't be solved logically, just trial and error.I had hoped they would make this game their biggest yet, and it might be, but it doesn't feel like it because there aren't enough interesting people to meet, fascinating puzzles to interact with, or unique places to explore compared to Botanicula and Machinarium.This isn't a bad game.  There's so much good in here.  The side puzzles are fun, and seeing all the cute things the wildlife does when you poke it is fun, but instead of adding so many of these things, they should have made the main story longer, with more places to visit, more things to do, more people to meet, more steps to take to discover and resolve the story.  As is, the story is over much too soon, and it's too easy.It looks like the team devoted most of their energy to the visuals and didn't think of as many interesting things for the player to do this time."

,Not Recommended,421120,33229331,Posted: 4 July,all,L.C.L.,"I bought this game mostly because of all the positive reviews and because I really liked most games that these developers put out in the past, and believe me, I really really really want to like this game. There's obviously a lot of love put into the audiovisual design of the game and in a way I'd almost recommend it simply to support the art designers/composers/animators etc.BUT- And saying this almost makes me sad - to me Samorost 3 completely fails as a puzzle game. First of all most puzzles are either painfully obvious (NPCs will literally show you an animation of the exact thing you are supposed to do) or so random that you can easily end up getting stuck randomly clicking around the screen until something triggers or you have to resort to either a walkthrough or the ingame guide that the game offers instead of a decent hint system in the sense of offering you slight nudges in the right direction when you get stuck. This is pretty frustrating on the long run there's barely any sense of actual accomplishment within the actual gameplay, and if design is the only selling point of a game, then to me there's barely any difference between ""playing it yourself"" and watching a lets play on youtube.Like most steam reviews this is just an opinion, and if it differs from yours, that's wonderful. I'm happy that other people can enjoy this game as much as they do. I really wish I could enjoy it more."

If you've read ""The Little Prince"" by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, I'm sure you'll be reminded of it as you go on this truly enchanting adventure. The backgrounds and the characters are a masterpiece, I've spent half of the game trying to figure out whether these are painted from scratch or using photos of real grass, moss and rocks, they look so real! There's no narration and just like in ""Botanicula"" the witty mmmms sounds coming from the heroes and the visual stories presented from the characters you encounter are far better than any words. The story and the environment are perfectly linked together by the mysterious music of the cosmic flute, you can feel a tingling down your spine every time you listen to it. Truly, playing this game does not feel like playing but living the story yourself, like turning the pages of a particularly inventive and beautiful children's book.

Fortunately the game lets you do that, I wouldn't want it any other way.What I heardThe music is just divine in some areas and sound FX are perfectly fitting - albeit sometimes nonsensical. At the time anyway.What I thoughtThe puzzles are too simple in places and frustratingly difficult (absurd?) in others, partly because this is such nonsense (figuratively speaking) that you have to step away from normality and think in the abstract (like, how would I NOT solve this puzzle).  More than intriguing enough to make you want to do it alone (don't cheat... no, don't. You shouldn't need to.)What I feltAbsolutely charmed. Nothing more needs to be said.ComplaintsIt will end.

,Recommended,421120,29409324,Posted: 21 January,all,Pretzelcoatl,"If any developer can evoke the spirit of an off-beat children's book, it is Amanita Design. Samorost 3 continues Amanita's trend of creating charming, peaceful, beautiful point-and-click adventure games with world-class visuals and music. But while Samorost 3 looks and sounds like only an Amanita Design game can, its appeal relies on aesthetics over mechanics.Like its predecessors, Samorost 3 is a modest point-and-click adventure game about a good-natured gnome who lives on a lush rock in space. There isn't much narrative to speak of, since the game contains no text or dialogue, but it appears that everyone has been generally inconvenienced by an evil monk atop a robotic space hydra. It's clear that you'll need to stop the monk at some point, but the gnome protagonist never acknowledges his quest. He wants little else but to fly his own spaceship and explore, which is appropriate enough in a game which feels mainly about exploring.Exploration is a common theme these days. We have an embarrassment of riches when it comes to atmospheric, aesthetics-first exploration indie games, Aesthetics-first games are controversial, but fans will say that they are all about the overall experience, even if the experience mainly consists of moving from point A to point B. While the same questions can be raised about Samorost 3's gameplay, the Samorost series predates the current indie trends by many years. When the first Samorost was released, the web was filled with oddball point-and-click Flash games, often designed as visual art showcases. Samorost fit in rather well with that sub-genre, as well it should have, as it was Amanita Design founder Jakub Dvorský's art school thesis.If you're wondering whether you would like the series, you can easily give the original a try; Samorost is still freely available online and can be finished in about half an hour. While most details have improved since the release of Samorost way back in 2003, the series has always insisted that world-class visuals and music are enough to warrant your attention. Samorost 3 maintains that philosophy while working to make everything feel more robust, from the puzzles to the music and the incredible landscapes.Nobody makes landscapes like Amanita Design. Every texture looks like it is taken from macro photography of a forest floor or a rocky wasteland. This effect evokes an ant's-eye perspective for the player. Samorost 3 combines photorealistically textured landscapes with digitally painted alien flora and fauna along with mismatched bits of scrapyard machinery. The combination feels rather dark at times, but it's buoyed by the endlessly cheerful protagonist. Altogether, the world of Samorost feels like a breath of fresh air amid a world of games which rehash the same visual themes in game after game. The same can be said of its music.Oh, the music. I've never played an Amanita Design game and not been impressed by the music. Amanita's composer Tomáš Dvorák has an immediately distinctive musical style. The music is moody and bare, featuring low woodwinds and a wide variety of percussion. Much of it sounds dark and lonely, with moments of nothing but the sounds of nature. The sound effects, recorded like foley from natural materials, work well alongside the photorealistic organic textures on nearly every screen.Samorost 3 doubles down on its music, indulging itself in musical sequences. I say ""indulge"" because the game often stops what it's doing to play out a musical sequence at length. The player gets to sit back and enjoy while the gnome dances along, one of many details that put a smile on my face. This game is nothing if not charming.This time around, the music is part of the gameplay. The gnome carries a horn with him that he alternately uses to listen to the environment or play like a clarinet. Samorost 3 seems aware that music is a major part of its appeal, so the game uses music as a reward. For example, whenever I unlocked an achievement, I also unlocked instruments in a little musical mini-game. After a while, I could conduct my own little orchestra. Even the narrative, what little there is, is about music. Samorost 3 has music deep in its DNA, unlike its predecessors which used it only for atmosphere.Samorost 3 is enjoyable, but it's easy to feel impatient with a game which suffers from the sort of pixel hunting of which old-school PC gamers have long since tired. I often found myself clicking on random bits of environment just to see if they did anything, much as I remember doing in the old LucasArts adventure games. Amanita Design rewards that behavior with little Easter eggs in the form of animations, sounds, and achievements which I wouldn't have found otherwise. There's no getting around it, though: some of the gameplay feels archaic.It doesn't help that Samorost 3's weirdness gets in its own way at times. I wish that there was a bit more method to its madness. I wonder, how am I supposed to know that I need to repeatedly click on a bug's antennae in a certain order to proceed? Presumably the game just expects me to click whatever I can and figure it out. Some puzzles made sense, but others kept me stuck and frustrated until I stumbled through. There's a particular puzzle involving an underground insect colony that still baffles me. I just couldn't reason my way through the loopy alien environments, which meant that progress was never a function of skill or reasoning. Still, the help system reduced the amount of time I spent stuck and kept me exploring the bizarre alien worlds.The gameplay flaws of Samorost 3 are normal for the genre. But unlike most other point-and-click adventure titles, Samorost 3 has neither text nor dialogue. Even the menus are text-free. (I ran afoul of that fact when I mistook the load button for a fast travel system. Oops.) On one hand, I like that this makes Samorost 3 accessible to nearly everyone in the world, and that it reinforces the strange, lonely atmosphere of the Samorost worlds. On the other hand, Samorost 3 has some trouble delivering nuanced instructions. Most immediate goals are given in the form of simple sketches. Even the help system relies on visual guides which aren't always clear.Can a point-and-click adventure title appeal to modern gamers? I think a game with this much personality can. However, I expect it to thrive in the world of mobile gaming, as has Amanita Design's first full-length game, Machinarium. Like Machinarium, Samorost 3 exists in an uncomfortable limbo between a full PC game experience and a lightweight mobile title. I played Samorost 3 on PC, but there was nothing about it that wouldn't translate well to a mobile touchscreen, assuming you play with a good pair of headphones. I suspect it will look like a heavyweight in the iOS and Android app stores. I have to imagine that the children's book vibe of the game would work quite well on a tablet.Mobile gaming aside, if point-and-click is dead in the broader gaming world, I don't think Amanita Design cares. Amanita has been making these games for thirteen years now without chasing trends or exploring other genres. Amanita has slowly carved out a niche for its unique brand of point-and-click adventure games, confident that these games will live and die on the strength of their aesthetics.Samorost 3 is a feast for the eyes and ears, but it won't be remembered for its gameplay. It evokes the feeling of a quirky, beautifully illustrated children's book without ever feeling childish. And just like a children's book, Samorost 3 is short, sweet, and shallow. Those who need mechanically compelling gameplay or engrossing narratives should look elsewhere. There isn't much left to recommend Samorost 3 if we set aside the incredible visuals and music, but why would we? Amanita Design leans hard into the philosophy that the experience is the game, and they always manage to earn my attention by sight and sound alone."

The game oozes charm and is a delight visually.  There's precious little hand-holding, so if confounding puzzle design frustrates you then you may want to seek challenge elsewhere.  Otherwise, Samorost 3 rewards patient and pensive puzzle solving - just keep trying and you'll eventually start to get a feel for what the game wants of you.  Don't do yourself the disservice of consulting a walkthrough - if you're stuck just walk away and come back to it later.  One thing that wasn't immediately apparent to me and could be helpful: the locked book on the menu is a hint system, and the lock is a rudimentary puzzle.  (Again, I'd recommend not using it if avoiding it is at all possible.  I wish I'd known so I wouldn't have accidentally spoiled one puzzle for myself early on.)  If playtime is important to your purchasing decision, Samorost 3 isn't long - I've 100%'d the game in around 5 hours of play."

The experience Amanita Design gained from making Machinarium and Botanicula is noticable right away. The interface is polished, the visual and sound design is incredible and there is a bigger focus on the plot this time, which is conveyed mainly through animated speech bubbles and enviromental details.The puzzles are logical despite taking place on alien planets, sometimes with different laws of physics and a very different flora and fauna. They rarely get too hard or too easy, and in case one gets stuck there is a hint book, although I never used it so I do not know if it's any useful.Collecting all the secrets gives you some reason to continue playing after the credits, although you will probably already have found most of them during the main story. This is not the kind of game you replay several times, but since it's relatively short (I beat it in 7 hours), you can always return to it in the way you would to one of your favorite movies, if you can't wait for whatever Amanita is cooking up next."

I played Samorost 1 over and over again when I was young and it has been fun to see Amanita evolve the visual style and feel of the game. This latest edition to the series is by far the best. It is cute, it is beautiful, it has one of my favorite soundtracks of all time (the volcanic vent planet theme is my favorite track). I would give it a 10 out of 10. One of the best point-and-click puzzle adventures out there.If you haven't played other Amanita Design games like Machinarium I also reccomend those. They also helped out with this really interesting movie calledKooky.Also you do not have to play the first two games to play this one although the first one is very short and isfree on Amantia's website.Also beware that while there is a guidebook in game that can be unlocked by a simple puzzle (and has no penalty for using it), there are some very challenging puzzles.

The puzzles can still be very interesting however, with most of them being the basis for a colourful animation or small musical scene.The overall experience of Samorost 3 however is a very positive one indeed, and one that I feel that most would enjoy very much.If you enjoyed any of the previous games by Amanita Design, or are just a fan of small, characterful and atmospheric indie games in general, then you should definitely consider buying this game.

I love Amanita Design and they have certainly lived up to their reputation for creating aesthetically appealing games. I definitely recommend it, with a few caveats:-Hearing impaired gamers will have serious difficulty with the game, as much of it relies very heavily on sound. There is no spoken language in the game, but if you can't hear differences in tone or match similar (but not identical) sounds, you won't be able to solve some of the puzzles. In games with dialogue, subtitles can make it possible for deaf gamers to play, but in this case, there is no visual alternative to hearing the sounds. As a hearing member of my local deaf community, I was disappointed that my deaf and hard of hearing friends would not be able to play a game which is so visually beautiful, and I feel this is something which should be made clear in the game's description.-Some elements of the design could have been better. In particular, when one of the cutscene-ish animations begins (usually triggered by talking to someone or playing a sound on your trumpet), you can't cancel or interrupt it. If you accidentally start a long story that you've already seen several times, you still can't do anything but wait. I couldn't find any way to skip them. Similarly, there are some areas where you have to solve a puzzle to get through (I'm thinking of one in particular where you have to use little birds as weights to pull chains to get safely across a gap). Even after you've solved the puzzle, however, every time you go through that area, you have to do the puzzle again. This was really tedious. If you know exactly what you need to do every step of the way to complete the game, you only have to solve the puzzle once, but as the average person will need to backtrack a few times to figure it out, it gets really irritating really fast. This happens several times in the game. Overall, there are a lot of long sequences you have to be patient with going through again and again as you try to figure out your next move. It almost gives the impression that the game wasn't tested by anyone who didn't know exactly how to beat it.These qualms aside, I do still recommend the game if you enjoy aesthetics and cute stories. However, if you haven't played Machinarium and Botanicula, I recommend playing those first, as I feel they are better overall in terms of design, and also a bit longer and more difficult, with more engaging stories."

I recommend to turn the volume up and enjoy the game!Pros:- atmospheric- easy controls- challenging puzzles but not too difficult- the hints are accessable if you cant figure out a solution- well-pacedCons:- I recommend saving a couple of times during your playthrough, because there is a gamebreaking instance during a puzzle (the one with the seeds and petals)7.5/10"

Visual storytelling at its best of course. I will say that the human sfx was a bit distracting when viewing such an alien world. I would have preferred more surreal sound design rather than the whimsical whoosh and whistle.If you know anything about Floex, you'll agree that he's outdone himself this time! Machinarium used to be my bar for indie game scores but this one is simply much more fanstastic!If you've enjoyed any of Amanita's previous games, this one's a no-brainer!"

I love all their previous games so my expectations were very high of Samorost 3 and they did not disappoint. The game has such a beautiful artistic style that you just want to sit back and watch in between solving the brilliantly designed puzzles. The sounds and music are so beautiful!

,Recommended,421120,23911771,"Posted: 28 June, 2016",all,Aequinox,"As with all Amanita games, the only major downside of Samorost 3 is its length. You can easily solve it in 4 hours, and there's virtually no replay value in it.But that concludes all cons, and there's a long list of pros to make up for them. The trademark artstyle is beyond beautiful, the atmosphere eerily charming, and the puzzles are in that ""just right"" zone of not too obvious, yet not at all frustrating. The story is simple yet has a lot of memorable moments that will make you go ""wow"" or ""aaaw"".Another forte of this title is its soundtrack by Tomas Dvorak. Maybe not an instant classic as the music of Machinarium was, but certainly on the same level.All in all it's more like an experience than a game, and most of all: true art. I'd recommend it with all my heart."

It's a chill point and click adventure game about a tiny man in a white onesie as he plays with his new (and super jazztastic) horn. You travel through the vibrant and, quite frankly, gorgeous world solving puzzles and saving the world.the first thing that hits you about this game is its art. The game is absolutely gorgeous. The fantastical aesthetic makes for a living world and each individual area builds its own personality out of the backgrounds. There's not much to say but that this game is one of the best looking games I've ever seen (especially the onesie. It's the best).In terms of gameplay, you're going to find that the game consists mostly of environmental puzzles with a few key items that can be pickd up and used. In other words, it's no Lucas Arts game where your inventory fills up. It tends more towards the Myst style, where you alter the environment to progress.Samorost 3 excells in letting the player discover the game. From the beginning, you know nothing about the tiny dude sporting a onesie and a horn except that he is very inquisitive (and a master jazz musician). Then, the game relys of the players own inquisitive nature to find the path forward. In other words, tiny dude's got good game design.And this is only scratching the surface. Samorost 3 also has amazing music and some really interesting puzzles. The first puzzle that I came across (the card game) was unique and truly a breath of fresh air after so many repetitive puzzle games. The puzzles also continued to be quite fun from then on.I cannot recommend this game enough. Between it's beautiful art, chill aestethic, and some truly novel puzzles, Samorost 3 truly deserves the onesie that it contains. Because it is just so stylin'."

Some puzzles can be frustrating, not because they're too hard, but because you sometimes have to go back and forth over lengthy distances which it can become tedious but this could be considered complementary to the game's unhurried vibe.It's an artful point and click adventure with a cute story, no verbal dialogue, and some relatively satisfying puzzles that can feel a bit tedious occasionally.

The artwork is beautiful and the animations are lovely but sitting through repeated animations just felt like a chore at times.For game design I think it needs more distinction in the hand-icon on whether an object can be interacted with and an object that can be moved.

With a good set of headphones, you really get immersed in the world with its incredible soundtrack. The graphics are outstanding as well, and featured some stunning bioluminescent aspects. The detail put into the environment, as well as the puzzles/achievements themselves, goes to show the care that went into the making of this game.It was a little shorter story than I would have preferred (mostly because I would have loved to had seen more), but a number of achievements can only be found after the game is completed anyways.However, the plot itself is actually a little weak. You're mostly just exploring and solving puzzles with no real motive for doing so. Your completion of the game has nothing to do with how you started it, so it feels more like just another completed puzzle rather than the game itself; I was surprised when the credits started rolling.Not having played any previous Samorost game, I had a completely fresh pair of eyes on this. Overall, the imagination put into this game blew me away. There was a certain child-like wonder that really enhanced the game for me. The sound effects alone added a bunch to gameplay experience.

This time his job is not to save his little sausage dog, but rather to learn the mystery of the fallen flute. After learning a bit about the past of the flute Mr. Gnome prepares his new Onion ship (*gasp* No sausage-can ship?) and sails away quite easily to the nearest planet.Throughout his about 6 or so hour adventure he discovers many-a unique puzzles, quirky and funny characters (also baddies!), reveals the past of the magical flute and even becomes a very skilled flute-player (Oh my!).--Keeping the art style, gameplay and music loyal to the Samorost series, I say that this game is worth every penny even if it felt quite short (~6 hours of gameplay, almost every achievement gotten).I bought the Cosmic Edition of this game. The soundtrack was worth the pay but I wasn't too impressed with the art book (Very simple concept art but you can't expect concept art to be always fancy, right?).The nature-inspired environments are a sight for the eyes, there are some catchy tunes in the game along with beautiful and atmospheric background scoring and the gameplay works great. A few downrights are that sometimes you have to go to another screen multiple times (ex. the infamously hard fruit puzzle). Luckily the game won't punish you for not understanding the puzzles; The Hint Book is there to guide you with clear pictures! The story's also a good one, resembling a kind of visual sci-fi novel.As a fan of the point'n'click genre and as a person who's been playing Amanita's games for a long while, I say that this is a wonderful game for anyone who loves point'n'clickers, creative puzzles, lovely visuals and amazing & calm soundtracks.8.8/10"

It is completely free from dialogue and subsequent awkward voice acting (although the characters communicate in some strange language), and instead illustrates what you must do in pictures. The puzzles are very clever and creative and the main character is silly in a loveable way. It's the first game I have played where if you get stuck, you don't need an external walkthrough because the game provides all the necessary hints without being blatantly obvious. Another thing that is great is that it's unlike other point and click games in that it doesn't make you collect a ton of random items to combine with other items and so on (which normally leads to convoluted and far fetched puzzle solutions), but instead focuses on interactions with the environment. Definitely one of my new favorite games, I strongly recommend giving it a go!"

The quality of its rich soundtrack is equally impressive, while fully original puzzles ensure there is nothing derivative about this title.In this adventure, you won't just point and click; you must also pull and hold and interact more directly with the environment and its wonderfully unusual inhabitants. A few puzzles had me briefly glance at a hint guide for brevity but not because they lacked sense.You play a charming little guy that goes out exploring floating microcosms in pajamas. His initial motivation is not entirely apparent but there's always a clear expected direction. All of this is intuitively achieved without words.Your little guy gets enthusiastic when he wins achievements and dances when completing major objectives. It's the cutest way to celebrate progression in a cheerfully naive manner.After the game's ending, players are free to roam the worlds in a sort of epilogue to complete missed and additional puzzles for extra achievements.

,Recommended,421120,34650683,Posted: 31 August,all,Pèpè Silvia,"One of the best indi games I've played in a looooong time. The art, sound, and overall concept, are unique and original, instead of the plethora of copy\paste trash that plagues the industry. From the second you start playing you know that the devs put all their heart and effort into perfecting the game. I came into this never playing the first two Samorost games, but it didn't matter.Instantly the art\animations jumped right out at me, and appreciated how detailed thier hand drawn, 2D world looked. Textures are crisp, models are intracately shaped, and every location is unique and detailed to the very last pixel. There is NO copy\paste in any of these scenes, which is pretty amazing. The ""2.5D"" art style adds a ton of depth to the scenes. Every time I'd switch to a new zone, I would move closer to my screen, trying to pick out every little detail.The sound design instantly stood out as well, it is truely unique. While it's typical to build the sound around the setting; in Samorost, the setting is built around the sound as well. Most (if not all) puzzles are designed around audio and visual cues to help you solve them. Once you do, random sounds will combine to form musical ""riffs"" to form a flowing track.Aside from the ambient music track, all of the sounds are voiced. They are made with a series of mumbles, coos, and grunts that create every sound. The ambient music was soothing yet haunting, calm but upbeat. Very hard to describe, but it helped set the mood even further.The only con I had was some of the transitions between locations takes a little long, but it gives you more time to appreciate the hard work that must have went into this game for such a small team.The game gave me ~8 hrs of play to complete the story and collect all of the achievements (I did use a guide to collect a few). There isn't really any replay value, but the game delivered 100% of it's value (for me) in the time I got out of it.If you have ANY interest in the genre, then you need to play this game. I bought it on sale, but I would have easily paid full price.9.5\10"

The graphics look *really* good, the sound and music are well done and entertaining, and I still got stumped by a few of the puzzles. FYI, the game is also available on android and ios if you'd like to play this on your phone."
