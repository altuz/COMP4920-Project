,Recommended,421260,20368020,"Posted: 6 January, 2016",all,FantasticPancake,"A charming, deceptively simple game. Easy to learn, difficult to master.You pit three random player-controlled units against a much larger number of weaker enemies. You have trickier and more powerful options, but a single mistake means losing 1/3 of your firepower.The game has an elegant tutorial and is very quick to learn.Its ranking system accomplishes two difficult tasks at once: motivation to get better at the game, and an effective difficulty curve. You'll probably blast through the first few ranks easily, but soon you'll find yourself in challenging environments that push you to master the mechanics. I can confidently say this regardless of your skill level or aptitude for this sort of game.Overall, a great buy for the price. You can play one of two distinct rulesets, either Light or Dark. Light offers much simpler mechanics, with units that jump and attack in easy-to-understand ways. Dark offers complicated individual pieces that do things like push other units, generate explosives, and warp across the edges of the board.I am excited to see how many hours of play this game offers me."

A simple ruleset with only one board but variable gamepiece placement makes this a very fun - albeit challenging - exercise in logic and planning.  Far less variety among moves and fewer pieces than chess leads to briskly paced games that reward focus on necessity and encourage a flexible tactical approach to achieving the goal: eliminating all the enemy captains.  I am so far (3 hours played) quite enjoying the smooth difficulty scaling, but can already see both the enemy quantity and type making my further progress hard-fought and well earned.  I have zero reservations recommending this at full price, much less on sale!  Militia is a carefully executed and interesting take on small-scale tactics that is well worth both the cost to purchase and the time to play."

The movement patterns are simpler with their limited range but those attack patterns, swap spells and refresh abilities of your units combined with the amount of enemies vs your 3 ones makes you think - or lose. This part makes Militia much more like a table top or the fight part of a classic RPG...with 1 HP units...Limited number of turns adds some additional pressure even though to me it seems at the moment that it is more of a rule to prevent endless fights - only have had 1 or 2 fights where i came close to the limit.More frustrating (but also challenging) is the ""3 wins vs 1 lose""-mechanic which means you have to clear 3 floors before it's a (real) win and you gain XP but every lose will cost you XP immediately. Those XP are only counted toward a level showing your progress and difficulty level - no upgrades or character progress or something like that involved.Oh, and the game swaps out your remaining 'support' unit if you lose your last 'fighting' unit to give you a better chance...or make your fine plan totally useless after that mistake..."

,Recommended,421260,29737024,Posted: 6 February,all,Ham Man,"Militia is a example of how you don't need fancy graphics to make a great game.The easiest way to describe it is ""Chess meets tabletop tactical RPG"". In Militia you control 3 random heroes against a big number of enemy units. To win a battle, you need to defeat all units marked with gold stars, or ""leaders"". When you kill all of them you win.But it's not that simple. To win a match in Militia you need to clear three boards with one go with the same units. Everytime you win you earn EXP and get higher ranks, making the game harder when you win. This way Militia is always challenging and as you get better at the game, it presents more difficult strategic challenges.The key to victory is learning the abilities of your heroes.For example the Warrior attacks three tiles in front of him, mage can move one tile and cast a X shaped spell or dash for two and attack one enemy. The Spearman/Horseman moves for two tiles and can move on a tile with a enemy unit killing it, and then can attack two tiles in a straight line. Paladin ""refreshes"" units around him when he attacks, allowing them to move again in their turn. Teleporting mage can teleport allies and enemies. He can't attack, but if he teleports a enemy on a tile occupied by someone else, he kills them both.With the enemies we have a different deal: Orcs can only move for one tile in four directions, Imps  move for three tiles diagonally, slimes keep cloning themselves, barbarians shiels units around them and archers have a strong ranged attack.And that's just the Light World. The Dark World introduces new heroes and enemies, and is a much harder challenge.If you want a game that will challenge your mind and make you feel like a master strategist when you win difficult battles against all odds (or rage hard because you lose 2/3 of your party because of one small mistake), this is the game for you."

The game play is emergent from a set of easy to grasp moves that each piece, yours and the computer opponent, can make each term.  Some have likened it to chess, and in some ways it does have that feeling. Mostly when you make a move you think is safe and realize it wasn't. But it doesn't feel like playing chess against a computer (which will generally kick your butt) but rather like an adventure game.  Imagine a tactics game where every move has to be given some careful consideration.The play is deliberate and quick. Once you clear a level, you tomble into the next, and it's one of those ""just one more..."" sorts of things and BOOM an hour or more has gone by!I recommend this game whole heartidly. It is an example of what really good game designers can accomplish with minimal (but very pleasingly assembled) production values.  To them, I say well done. To everyone else: if you like turn-based tactics of any kind, this is your game."

It reminds me a bit of chess. There's a 'Light' and 'Dark' mode, each with it's own unique units and enemies. It's a great game that I really recommend."

76561198027178139,Recommended,421260,24576998,"Posted: 28 July, 2016",all,Racocac,"A fun little board game. Actually, it's two games in one as there is a ""light"" and a ""dark"" mode with different unit sets and vastly different rules. Basically, you control a small number of pieces (1 to 3) against a huge horde of weaker pieces (10-20 is typical after the early levels). Your job is to take out a couple of enemy pieces - those marked with a star (typically 4-6 enemies are starred). The movement and attack rules for your pieces (and those of the opponents) seem very hard to remember, but after a couple games you'll be quite familiar with them, surprisingly enough, so no problem there! As you move up in ranks (the more you win, the higher your rank is, leading to harder setups - you can also lose ranks if you lose too much) you will have more enemies, while you will have to make do with 3 pieces at most. Yet with careful thinking, you can set up elaborate attack strategies and kill enemies without losing any of your pieces. ""Unwinnable"" scenarios are uncommon - I've yet to meet one, though technically I guess it might be possible.If there is any disadvantage to the game, it's that replayability is not necessarily endless - once you learn both rule sets, you're basically just doing the same thing, except in different setups. The fact that setups are randomly generated means the game stays fresh for a long while, but even so, eventually one might get bored. Still, it's a cheap and cost-effective game. If you get it on sale, it's almost free, and certainly worth it."

Simple yet elegant, casual yet challenging, chilling yet additive, this is definitely a sweet game that captures that simplicity with great game mechanics. Like one of the other reviewer, this game does feels like a chess-ish game. Your objective is to kill off enemy units tagged with a Star icon within x turns, using only 2-3 units. You have to wait 3 rounds (they call it 'floor') to win a match.I give it a + for the soothing music. Never gets bored. In fact, I find myself kept playing it late at night when I am suppose to sleep already!! :D"

You get some a random board setup and enemies either attack you if they can or move randomly (near as I can tell).It gets a thumbs up because it's a GOOD puzzle game, but I was a bit disappointed by the Steam tags since it led me to think it was more of a board game against an AI."

I was pleasantly surprised to find that underneath the minimalist presentation there is a game with a surprising amount of depth that has the potential to suck you in for hours on end. I found myself saying ""just one more level"" until 3 AM. It's also great if you just have a couple minutes to play.The leveling system is a great way to measure your skill, keep the game at just the right dificulty, and raise the stakes of a single player game. It feels like climbing the mmr ladder in Dota. The puzzles are procedurally generated, so the replay potential is really limitless.I haven't played much of the dark mode expansion yet, but it's basically like a sequel. It's the same game design,  the same objective, but a whole new set of units for you and the enemy. The units have more complex moves, so it's great if you get tired of the light mode.I'd recommend this game to anyone that likes puzzles, chess, or other strategy games. It's really a textbook example of excellent game design.10/10"

It is a very complex strategy game in to play well, one must look forward to what options each character has with the next move and the move after that... and the enemies and howtheymight move (not nearly as determistic as robots).It is a game that you can look at, think, and analyze and play at the rate you want to.

It projects a strange kind of attraction. It is by no means a brain-raker-difficult kind of experience. The mechanics are incredibly simple to pick up and apply. Oftentimes, I have caught myself thinking it is too easy. And yet, I do lose a stand every once in a long while and always keep coming back for more. It has already been noted that the game has a calming, meditative quality and it is true. It is great stress relief but also fun. The music, while every bit as minimalistic as the whole experience, it very good. And for all its simplicity, I do find my braincells stirring a little as I chase the orcs and imps down the dungeon halls. Something to reach for when you want an easygoing and pleasant experience that is more soothing than sophisticated. A good gin & tonic, if you will."

I've put dozens of hours into Axes and Acres and their latest, Minos Strategos.Militia is a fun game and I can somewhat recommend it. It has many of the features that I like in BrainGoodGames - simple rules but lots of complex strategies.The AI is very simple but the game is definitely a challenge. Unfortunately that is the one flaw in Militia and it is why it is my least favourite of the BrainGoodGames I've played. I reached level 6 after a couple of hours of gameplay and I really struggled to accomplish anything after that. In fact, if anything I got worse at the game, mostly as a result of frustration. The challenge ramps up too quickly for me.Nor sure what was happening with my game but I got quite a few erros. Reinstalling fixed an error that would sometimes occur when I pressed ESC. A few games later I got a crash after winning a game."

Although those always tended to be easy unless you were in the final levels of the minigame, at least the ones I played.But this game is like an improvement on that, with interesting mechanics, difficult but doable puzzles, and very out of the box unit abilities that makes great use of a 'wrapping around' affect.Seriously, when I grabbed this (And it literally only took like five minutes to download) I sat and played it for about three hours. It's that addictive and compelling. So don't be turned off by it's minimalist style, it's a fantastic game.The only con I can think of is the music, which is rather obscenely loud by default, but you can turn it down, so it's not that much of a con."
