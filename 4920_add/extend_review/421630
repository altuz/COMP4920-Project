,Recommended,421630,19186024,"Posted: 20 November, 2015",all,Loren,"Just finished my first full playthrough.  This is by one of the authors of Choice of Romance (Affairs of the Court), and if you enjoyed that writing style -- intrigue, drama, mysteries, complex plots with great payoffs, and deftly-written characters with a lot of emotional veracity -- this will be exactly the kind of Choice of Game/Hosted Game you're looking for.  In comparison to that earlier work Study in Steampunk is a tad more predictable if you know the basic outlines of the most popular Sherlock Holmes stories, but there are still a lot of other unexpected elements thrown in, and the characters are really fantastic.  For me this is the most important point: I tend to judge CoGs on good characters and good roleplaying choices.  This is a game where just about every time I wanted to say X to a character or respond in Y way to a development, there X and Y were exactly on the menu, which tells me it's been well thought out in a way some games just aren't.  It's also got a pretty good length to it -- some Choice of Games may leave you feeling wanting despite a superficially impressive word count, but this one is truly long and substantial.  This is the most enjoyable CoG I've played in years and I really can't recommend it enough.  The only real flaw in my mind is the lack of ability to play as female, but don't worry, you can still romance men if you want ;)"

It's got drama, action, deep and heartfelt relationships, mystery-solving, and lots of intense and even painful moments. You play for the highest stakes, definitely.I also cried a lot.Enter you, yet unnamed male protagonist, stumbling back into your old life after surviving a harsh partly robot/mecha war between your Empire and another country. There's plenty of choices to make -- be a faithful soldier, become a traitor rebel, pursue forbidden magics, and pick someone to give your heart to, if you want.The Good+ The general atmosphere of the novel (Victorian steampunk)+ Lots of murder mystery solving+ Great ""buddy cop"" story with your partner in crime+ Layered story with political intrigue, including spies and rebels+ The magic system that's introduced+ Action! Drama! High stakes!+ High replay value+ Save points (!)The Bad- Predictability, even if you're just a bit familiar with the stories this game borrows from (Sherlock Holmes, Jack the Ripper, etc.)- No skip option for replay purposes- ???Sure, I might be biased because I have a weakness for Victorian-style mystery solving and steampunk, but this game really got me invested and involved up to a point where I was genuinely nervous what would happen if I picked a certain choice. The stakes are quite high, and your choices have a huge amount on influence on your relationships with other characters, various story elements, and also on the endings.10/10 would play again"

Every choice you make feels like it has weight and impact on the story, while still flowing together to create a whole narrative. The character you play as feels like a real person and rather than making descions based on numbers or what will bring the best outcome I found myself thinking ""What would he do under the circumstances?"" I just can't recommend this game enough to anyone who enjoys story-based games."

An interactive novel, as with all Choice of Games titles, Choice by Gaslight revolves around you and the choices you make. The story changes heavily depending on your decisions, and especially so once you have to make a choice between three (technically four, later on) factions.Choice by Gaslight does a wonderful job at immersing you in a steampunk world. With giant mechs, passenger zeppelins, a bit of magic (which is prohibited to an extent, and can be used by you either for good, evil, or not at all), and a Victorian-esque setting, fans of the steampunk genre will likely find themsevles right at home. While I feel as though the earlier chapters do a better job at provoking imagery, the game still manages to immerse you later on as well.Whilst I have only, at the time of this review, played the game once, I can still say that your choices do indeed affect the story, so fans of RPGs will also find a lot to love in this game, which could even be described as a text-based RPG.Additionally, a main advantage this title has over other Choice of Games titles is that this one has deeper character relationships than even Choice of Robots, in my opinion. While I personally found the romantic relationships rather limited (as far as I could tell, siding with the faction that I did means you cannot have a romantic relationship at all), the friendships- or, perhaps, rivalries- with other characters are deep and make you care about your in-game friends.Altogether, Choice by Gaslight is an immersive steampunk RPG, that, despite being (almost) entirely text-based, will likely not soon be forgotten, especially for steampunk fans. Overall, 8/10."

Like with the rest of the games from this series, there lies an complex interplay of character relationships and political factions that provides a wide array of responses and skillsets to help create your persona.  For example, on my first playthrough I played the part of a pacifist medical specialist that chose to partake in the Resistance's efforts to create a more balanced government, but retaining my humanity by saving all my former allies and those that required help.  It felt like all my choices matter, and that there were multiple strengths to build your character across is a plus.  However, it would have been great for an option to choose the gender of your character, as the game automatically assumes that you are playing as a man, which can take people out of the narratice if using a female persona.Other than that, the story world of this game is great and encompasses many different morally grey areas. A central focus on the game's lore revolves around a group of people known as ""the sun-touched"", who possess the ability to drain or give life force to other people.  Through this ability, the sun-touched and the vampiric ""light-eaters"" have created a feudal society at the expense of treating commoners as nothing more than cattle and serfs.  On the other hand, your country Mercia has broken away from such worship and have ushered a technological revolution, with all the pros and cons that they entail, with constant pleas for labor reform and unions.  In fact, the situation can be viewed as so abhorrent that a Resistance has formed to express the discontent of the working class which amounts to a lot of vigilante justice, sabotage, and outright terrorism.  Of course, as the main character, you are one of the sun-touched in hiding, and it is up to you to choose whether or not to develop these latent abilities or master something else entirely.  The friends and lovers that you make, the factions that constantly vie for each other's power and influence, will certainly provide enough intrigue to last a good few hours.As a result, I would highly recommend this game to people who love a good story due to its longevity and cheap cost."

Needless to say, I was apprehensive.Now imagine an exensive 300+ page novel that is all about you and your adventure. That's what this is. It took 10 hours to finish it for the first time, and every choice I made, every flick of my head or slight wording difference kept me alive and exhilerated to the ending. Even the most trivial of choices contributed to crafting my own personal story; a story that touched, and scared me more than any first person shooter could.If you like fast-paced novels with biting mysteries and high stake choices, this is a game for you."

While it draws inspiration from classic tales, it succesfully weaves in creative and original storylines that keep you hooked. I usually just do a single playthrough of a game and go back to quickly change my choices and skim through the different outcomes, but I actually felt compelled to take my time and enjoyed replaying Choice by Gaslight. The characters feel real and their personalities and views make them enjoyable to interact with. They're people and have certain opinions set in stone, but they aren't as prone to flipping out on you if you do one thing wrong like a lot of the other games seem to do. The author was thoughtful enough to give you a whole list of dialogue options to choose from so you don't feel as penciled in or as forced into a strong opinion when you mean to be moderate like many other Choice Of games often do. The characters and story as easy to get invested in and fall in love with (i don't want to admit how many times i've replayed this to re-romance one character *cough* Alexandra *cough*) and the game gives you many chances to develop your MC. It also, thankfully, has opportunities to save your progress as the end of each act. It's a shame that they gender-lock your MC and have no character relationship meter like some other Choice Of games have, but I can't recommend this game enough and only pray that there's hopefully a sequel for it someday."

It makes reading a story very bitesize, and interactive too; a bit like those dice driven RPG books from the 80s... but without dice... or the book!I've surprised myself by how well I'm progressing through the game after just 99 minutes. Not sure I get the concept of ""sun worship"" and ""light eating"" but it's an insight into a weird steampunk world anyway. I've tried to choose overtly non-confrontational choices in the game and it seems to be paying off so far.Anyway, it's my first text adventure in MANY many years and this is a nice one. There's choices to be made on every 1-3 pages of the story and each page is very short and digestible. Good job, since I'm not good with reading lots in one go. I like this a lot."

The player has the ability to ignore important elements of the story and take their own path if they wish it.The only complaint I have is that the writer is obviously a Sherlock/Watson shipper and writes every scene between the two of them as if they are five seconds from tearing each others clothes off even if the players Watson is straight."

All the characters as well, from minor to major, are excellently written and often quite complex. Your relationships with all these people develop, deepen and evolve over time depending, of course, on how you interact with them and where your allegiances lie... And without spoiling anything the story is full of exciting twists and turns. You're never sure quite where it'll take you next but there are enough hints and clues that you can come up with your own theories; making it very satisfying to follow along with your character's moments of dawning realization. Something rare and delightful in stories of mystery and intrigue.As I've yet to do more than the one playthrough I can't speak to the branching paths though it seems like the story will make many quite drastic changes depending on how and what you do. In addition there are many sub-plots interspersed through the story that are (or at least seemingly are) also diverse and varied in their outcomes. There's probably a lot more I could say though at this point I feel my words won't do it justice.I'll certainly be playing through this again, and probably many times. I thought that nothing would ever be able to dethrone Choice of Robots as my favourite CYOA game, but here it is. I don't know that I've ever been so glad to be proven wrong.10/10"

What exactly that means is up to you.The mechanics of the game are choice based (as expected) but also stat based.

The story is intense, the characters are vivid, and the paths and endings are really varied. The different careers and characteristics available to my own character were fascinating and I found myself replaying, wanting to explore different branches of the story.There are lots of wonderful tie-ins to historical and fictional events of the time period, even though the setting is heavily fictionalized. I'd happily recommend it to anyone who likes thrillers, detective stories, science fiction, Victorian-esque settings, and really just excellent writing."

This was my first CoG game so I wasn't sure what to expect going in. What I found was a well-written story where my choices actually affected how the story would turn out. I thought that the story flowed very well from one moment to the next to create a cohesive narrative. Immediately after finishing the game, I felt compelled to go through it again in order to see what different choices would have. I would like to mention that you can only play as a male character, although you can pursue either males or females as romance options, if that makes a difference.If you are curious about the story or the type of game this is, I would recommend trying the demo to get a feel for the game.

Twice.It's a unique take on Sherlock Holmes in a world with magic and a war born of severe cultural divide. Unlike most Holmes stories with magic, it approaches the subject in a concrete way that doesn't trivialize the detective work. It isn't strictly a detective story, though - it's really more about deciding how your character views his own abilities, the political conflict in the world, and his role in the ongoing conflict.If you're looking for a game where you get to discover the evidence and come to your own conclusions, this isn't it, but if you want to see some very interesting world-building and make choices - often morally grey ones - about how you fit into that world, you should give this a try.Probably the element that impacted me the most, though, is one of the romance options. All games by this publisher (to my knowledge) allow you to pursue relationships with certain characters regardless of their and your gender. Unlike other games by this publisher, you can only play a male character in this game (in my opinion, the quality of the writing still puts this one head and shoulders over the others, but I am a man, so I'm probably biased). There is a gay romance option that occurs so beautifully and naturally that I became very invested in it. As a gay man, I'd love it if more games had relationships like this one."

The characters are quite personable and I found myself restarting each part, just to make sure the characters I liked stayed around another day. At one point in my story, the main character (you, sorta - it's written in 2nd person POV) goes through a depression and it truly felt as though I experienced the same exasperating situation and loss. It's certainly been a while since I've read a serious, quality choose-your-own-adventure novel, and I'm glad I chose this one.The immersion I experienced had my heart beating when things looked grim but turned out better than expected, waves of relief when there's a moment of safety, and the weight of the empire on my shoulders when a traitor or Vlaski spy is trying to ruin my perfect balance of action and respite.The only problem for me was there were a few more typing errors than I'd like to see, but honestly, it's 277,000 words with intricate branching paths and lots of replay value, so it's not that big of a deal. This is a book that captured the attention of a person who hasn't read for pleasure in years due to depression, and that includes required reading selections for courses. This is definitely worth the $3.99 USD, and I'd buy it again in a heartbeat if something happened to it in my game library.TL;DR: Quality writing, highly immersive, action, drama, romance options, worth more than some $15 books I have."

I've long been a fan of the 'Choice of games' games, and I've never yet played a game by them I didn't like. This one, however, was the best by far. Perhaps it is in part due to my partiality for the oldfashioned England, from the days described so well by (among others) Charles Dickens and Bram Stoker. This tale perfectly captured that setting, described the streets of London so well I felt almost like I was walking them myself. The narrative so well written, the choices I was presented with so heartwrenching and engaging, well... In short, there is nothing negative I have to say about it."

It stands up to the very best of the other choice of games, leaving very little to be desired. There are a few limitations to your customization, like you can't pick a female character, though that didn't bother me all to much. You also are thrust into the role of a Doctor, without any way to choose a different path that I've found. However, the role of a Doctor is more of a secondary, and the game derfinetely allows you to decide what you want to do with the rest of your character. All in all, one of the best written choice of games I've played thus far, right up with Choice of Robots in my opinion."

I just finished my first playthrough, and the first thing I did, just before writing this review, was to email the author to ask about a sequel. The world she has crafted is complex, interesting, and believable. The magic she has added to this world is minimal, but she has used it to astounding effect. What I enjoyed most though were her characters. Pretty much everyone I met eveolved to be more than just an extra to fill space. I have in fact fallen so in love with my own character that I hesitate to replay the game, as I feel I would lose the connection that was created. And because I was able to do exactly what I wanted at nearly every turn, and so that character really feels like me.
