Not enough time is spent on character development, so some arcs feel lacking, as if they shouldn't even exist. But♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan shortly after and most of it starts making sense, if you didn't figure it out by then, as the game's filled with predictable post-apocalyptic tropes. The ending feels a bit abrupt, but the epilogue more than makes up for it.Harmonia follows the usual key modus operandi and, despite its flaws, does not fail to punch you in the feels. However, you're not missing much if you've already played planetarian.It might also include:Great music, powapowas, military fanfics, one dimensional characters, high pitched voices, big-eyed waifus, sexual innuendos, half-naked nuns, no censorship.Oh, and the vertical textbox was a really good idea for an easier reading/eye-travel, at least to me."

Likeplanetarian,Harmoniais a somewhat short kinetic novel, but makes up for that with its enriched storytelling.$10 is a great deal to experience such a wonderful story that will leave you with all colors of emotions. As it may be Itaru Hinoue's final Key work, this is more of a reason to read this perhaps last-of-its-kind Key series with this iconic art style."
,Recommended,421660,30956164,Posted: 4 April,all,Akka,"The world in harmonyHarmonia is a kinetic novel (VN with only one route and no choices to make) from prolific studio Key. Having awoken from stasis, the robotic protagonist must learn to adapt to the clinging remnants of humanity present in a post-apocalyptic world.PlotI'll be addressing the storyline first as it is the most crucial aspect. While it does not start with the most creative premise, the story soon becomes more complicated and endearing. Unfortunately the story is too short to accommodate for much character development, so most people end up as flat as they started.Perhaps also due to its brevity, the game is riddled with pacing issues. Individual chapters retain a very sharp focus on only one character at a time. Also, for the majority of the story very little is at stake. Suddenly everything ramps up at the last hour but then each problem neatly and quickly resolves itself.VisualAnyone familiar with Key's other works will immediately notice a marked improvement on character portraits. The more contemporary art style is more soothing and pleasant than anything they've drawn before.SoundA handful of moving songs, and even one fully composed with lyrics. An impressive amount of work went into making sure everything sounded and looked great.Three stars out of fiveHarmonia has about five hours worth of reading, making it the perfect size to dip your toes into.Personally though I preferred their earlier work, Planetarian. The character's are more developed, the plot is more interesting, and there's a much more vivid sense of dread and suspense. If you enjoyed that then come back and play Harmonia."

I've had mixed feelings aboutkey's works in the past:  I loved Planetarian, Clannad, and Angel Beats, but wasn't so fond of Kanon, Little Busters and now Harmonia.The theme this time is feelings or emotions.  Our protaganist has awoken without his, and most of the early story is about how he rediscovers various emotions.  Most of these chapters end up feeling disjointed, often focusing on a single character, which ends up hurting the pacing.  The end of the story is reminiscent of Planetarian, but feels more like they just needed a plot device to get to the reveal.  Once there, I found that reveal to be even more contrived than the reused plot device.  I do recognize that part of my dissatisfaction here was related to my understanding of the philosophical issues that they're trying to use as the foundation of their story, so it's likely to not be as annoying to most people.Other people have mentioned that Harmonia reminds them of Planetarian.  We have the post-apocalyptic future with only androids and humans remaining, but that was the end of the similarity for me.  While the setting is certainly a match, the story and characters in Planetarian have more depth than was managed here.  Each character is pretty much limited to a single emotion for the entire story, which makes it hard to grow really attached to any of them.key's works focus on getting the audience to invest in the characters; so if you don't or can't empathize with the characters, the stories just aren't satisfying.The artwork was wonderful.  Most of it retains a slight pencil & watercolor look to it instead of looking purely digital.  They also added an subtle effect of moving pencil shading over the images, which I particularly liked for some reason.  The music was simple but sweet and generally fit the scene.  However, I didn't come away terribly attached to it.  Having the full soundtrack for DLC would be nice, but I'm not going to miss it.  The one thing that consistantly annoyed me about the music was that they waited unitl the very end of the game to use the main theme song with vocals.  Despite multiple scenes where it would have been applicable and could have been used to better effect.  Instead it was tossed in at the climax to try to make the ending as emotional as possible.  Disappointingly, we were not given subtitles for the main theme, though we do get them for the ending theme song.Overall, I don't think it was a bad game--I've seen much worse for more money--but it's not one I'd really recommend either.  $10 for a short novel is reasonable, but the story was just too weak for my tastes.Note:  Look in the Harmonia\bgm folder for an Ogg Vorbis version of the soundtrack."

Though relatively short (3-5 hours), Harmonia tells a story much more complex than it may seem at the first glance. That's actually a thing with all Key works: you have to read it all to really understand what authors meant, what ideas they were after. In that regard Harmonia is the same, since at the beginning I felt like main characters had very strange, unnatural personalities, and that kinda threw me off, but towards the end everything made sense. Good to see that after all those years at least some VN companies have that spark in them. Key is an example for the whole industry and I definitely recommend Harmonia to every VN reader out there: old and new alike."

,Recommended,421660,25673599,"Posted: 24 September, 2016",all,ＨＥＹ　ＷＡＳＳＨＩ,"This review has no spoilers.I've played Planetarian way back and oh boy I lost count how many tissues I've used in that novel. This visual novel has no choices so you just get to enjoy the ride in one way. Finished reading this. I must say I immensely enjoyed it.Story- Post-apocalyptic setting about a boy who wakes up with no memories. Yes, we know it's kind of tropey or not that unique but the way the story builds up definitely makes up for it. The pacing may seem a bit quick as there are little to no fillers for this novel. I frankly believe it's enough for anyone to digest what's happening in the story.Sound- Normal ambient music that accompanies whatever is happening in the screen. And does it's job well.- BGMs. I think this is probably the strongest part of the novel as it accompanies the scenes well. If you're familiar with previous Key games, you know what to expect as I think Key's in-house music people are the same people responsible for the music in this novel. I'd buy the BGMs as DLC if it were even possible.- Character voices is fine. I'm not really into voices but I felt the voices done here were done well as it kinda ties with what's happening. No spoilers but you'd kinda get it if you trek the novel all the way through the end.- It's not a Key novel if it doesn't have any orgel/music box in it. I'm a sucker for anything like those.Graphics- Well, graphics aren't really the main point of the VNs but I do like the character designs for it to fit in this novel. Itaru's doing the characters so there's that.Characters- I think this is the part where it doesn't shine as well as the other aspects of the novel. It felt like the characters weren't that fleshed out very well but nevertheless, it's just enough for you to know and care about them. I've mentioned how the novel has little to no filler so that may be a reason for it.Others- I don't think it's fair to compare this Planetarian as this one is more about feelings rather than Planetarian's tone of hopelessness (how I felt it). But they do share something common, I guess.- I remember Planetarian to be longer. Though that may be because I used to read slower back then.- No JP text. So if you happen to be an elitist or just take into consideration that JP text is a must, I'd advise you to skip this or at least wait if they will ever implement JP text in this novel.- Can't complain about translation as there is nothing to compare to. Except the voices. Some stiff and awkward translation of the spoken lines but it gets the point across. Most of the translated voiced lines are fine as it is.- Prepare some tissues.- Playing porn games? I suggest you use your fap tissues for your eyes instead.- For this price tag, I think it's fine for the story/experience you get. You'd probably avoid this if you're more into price per hour though.tldr;It's great, go get thisOrGo get this if:- You liked Planetarian- You want to cry- You want some easy reading- To know what is love (insert unfunny reply here)- Feel POWAPOWA inside"
,Recommended,421660,30888356,Posted: 1 April,all,Reimu☆rena~,"A brand new Visual Novel from VisualArts/Key which heavily focuses on emotions, mainly happiness, sadness, anger and love.Graphics: 9/10Harmonia has a very modern art style which is a step-up from their previous works; I’m mainly comparing it with planetarian and Clannad. The characters are all drawn beautifully, but the same cannot be said with a lot of the locations; they seemed “average” compared to the rest of the art work.Storyline: 7/10It is very much like planetarian from start to finish. It had a very similar setting (a futuristic, “broken” world where survival is a priority) and the ‘boy’ coming across a town full ofPhiriodsas does the main character from planetarian as he discovers a place where he finds a ‘non-human’. It’s all too similar and I find that VisualArts/Key didn’t try to come up with something a little different. But that’s not to say that the entire story was “bad” and “copied over”. Although, the first 5 chapters starts off slow. But it does pick up rather quickly from chapter 6 – 8; almost too quickly because a lot of information gets told in a matter of lines and scenes. I really felt like they rushed the ending. Nonetheless, the story isn’t bad, but it could’ve done a lot better.Sound: 9/10Simply amazing. It doesn’t have that much soundtracks when I checked, but I was still impressed on how they used those soundtracks in the VN. Each specific scene had their own soundtrack depending on the situation. It’s almost has if they were ‘themes’ dedicated to a character or location.Gameplay: 9/10Slight issues with the font settings from the start (I fiddled almost 20 mins trying to figure out how to make the fonts even show up, as they could not be read). But once sorted, it was smooth sailing from there. No lag, crashes or UI defects to report.Price: 10/10For £6.99 it’s a great deal, it’s not asking for a lot (compared to other VNs). Its guaranteed to give you an experience like planetarian with some slight improvements here and there. If you haven’t read planetarian, this VN will give you a completely different experience from all the other VNs out there."
76561198026191965,Recommended,421660,25835332,"Posted: 3 October, 2016",all,|STE|Thekill9714,"Harmonia is about a robot with the appearance of a teenage boy leaving the tomb of his forgotten brethren to find the outside world, as he does, he finds that the world itself is dead and barren. Overtime he reaches a town with people and starts living in the towns church. He attempts to hide his robotic nature so he can be of service to humans, but lacks emotions making it a complicated issue, the story takes you on a journey to discover these emotions and why they are significant while also showing us how to care for each other. It emphasizes good intentions even when it may not always seem to be, but the world heavily contrasts these emotional states. May it be caring for people of the town or strangers, the town gives this warmness, but the world shows only the reverse.Alike to the above mentioned Planitarian the reverie of a little planet, this story focuses not on the robots or humans. Rather the story is about helping one another. Alike to Planitarian the main character only wishes to provide the most help he can give, at times neglecting himself. As the story progresses emotions change and so does the town and its people as they all grow to some extent. Though there is not much interactivity for the reader being a kinetic visual novel, it's easy to see from the main characters point of view, which in turn allows not only just the characters to go on this adventure, but the reader as well. When in comparison to Keys other works this one is clearly one to grab. My other recommendations include Planitarian my favorite of Keys works, which is now also a film and anime. You also have their biggest and most popular creation Clannad and its addition Tomoyo After, which also have been made into multiple animes and other medias.  You also have Angle Beats and Charlotte which though are amazing are primarily animes.In conclusion, this game has the same impact that Key is known for with their Kinetic novels making you feel strong emotions primarily sadness which causes the Novel to be a great and fond memory for the readers. Along with the professional design of the stories many parts including the music, art, and voice. You are sure to have an entertaining and engrossing read that stimulates your mind to think and continue reading till finished. Lastly I would once more like to recommend Planitarian: the Reverie of a little planet, the shortest Key novel, but I think the gem in the rough. Alike to the others it carries the amazing story along with the above elements. Specifically I like to note that the music will never leave your memory after playing it. Planitarian though having no connection in lore to this game goes hand in hand due to their closeness in themes and their design.Thank you for reading this review and I hope that you will find as much joy as I did with this product.I also like to thank Key for another job well done."

Maybe in a few years from now I'll see it differently. ^^,The art was great, the music enhanced the experience, the voice acting was good, and I liked the characters. The story was... mmm, short but meaningful.I read Harmonia mostly because some of the illustrations drew me in and, given that I enjoyed most of Key's other VNs (I read Little Busters!, Clannad and Rewrite) Harmonia being released on Steam gave me a chance to support Key in their latest endeavors without buying something I've already read.Wrapping up I can say Harmonia was short, but good. It took me about 8 hours to finish it, but you can definitely finish it in less. It felt a little like a children's tale for the first 4 or so chapters, but then abruptly got a bit heavier. Should you buy it? If you like Key's works then yes you should, their stories have gotten me through some tough times. :) If you haven't read a Key VN/KN before, and you're on the fence, then Harmonia might not be a bad place to start, it definitely has a distinct Keyesque style and might give you an idea of what to expect from their longer works.That being said I hope this review was helpful to you in some way and have a good one."

Both are post-apocalyptic/dystopian setting and both deal with co-existence with humans and robots (Philoids in this case).Planetarian is way better. but that's not to say Harmonia isn't anywhere bad. Without spoiling the major plot points, Planetarian pulled a big irony on the reader, and that irony is heavily implied that it will continue after the interaction of the two mains. Oh, and how relevant that pull is in the dystopian setting. In Harmonia however the biggest pull they made is arguably irrelevant to the bigger picture of the dystopian world setting.Still I'm giving this a thumbs up. It did made me sit down for the entire latter half of the novel. My personal advice is that if you have to choose between the two, ask yourself if you want the beginner level (Harmonia) or the expert level (Planetarian). Oh, and visual-wise (since both titles are VISUAL novels after all), Harmonia is better hands down."

The story follows Rei's interactions and development of emotions (which he has lost) and his understanding of new feelings... but he can't help shake the feeling something is wrong, the towns people seem off time to time and Shiona seems to be hiding something, and then there is the lonely girl Tipi...The story essentially breaks into 3 small Arcs, Madd, Tipi and Shiona (though Shiona's and Tipi's are sort of merged into a close one, these 3 arcs also are the highlight of the game, for spoiler reasons i wont mention what is what with them but they are essentially your onion cutting moments. The ending for me was great, tear jerking and well told, you really felt like you was involved in the scene and if you have grown to like the characters, you will likely be shedding them tears here, the game does offer and additional epilouge which i felt was a bit 'meh', most commend it greatly and love it but i feel it ruins the previous scenes.The art in Harmonia is brilliant to say the least, especially the character designs, i can be picky at times over what i like when looking at characters but this game did an amazing job, this goes equally for sound, the sound commonly sets the mood very well and even when you are in no special situation, you get a feel for the world around you just by the sound.I wont deny, the game does get off to a slowish start, which it isn't bad, it doesn't really pull you in either, in fact, the Library was the first trigger to my attention as Tipi actually got me interested in her, especially when you see others reactions to seeing her. Needless to say, whilst the first chapter might not be the most interesting, don't knock the game, things get into full swing here and you will find yourself curiously addidicted to finding out what happens.As a whole, for the small price you pay for the game i would deffinetly recommend it, the game seems to average an average of about 6-8 hours gameplay (i have played it twice but don't let my time deiceve you, i had no net at first so it didn't log the hours) and the first was about 6-7hours with the second being a little longer (probably due to breaks) but it is 7 hours of great emotional story tellings you wont want to miss."

From the visuals to the music to the voice acting, Key is in top-form here. The concept and characterization are both exceptional.It's a shame that in the end, the story fails to deliver.Which is unfortunate, because everything preceding the story's conclusion is amazingly well-executed. Our main character, who is desperately in search of a way to fix his absent emotions, is a compelling, earnest lead whose desire to help those around him fit his background. The upbeat, yet level-headed Shinoa is a perfect compliment to this goal. The reclusive librarian, Tipi, and the grumpy owner of a general store, Madd, both provide interesting contrats and conclusions one can make from Rei's straightforward, earnest attempt at friendship. Better yet, the story takes several surpsing, yet well-foreshadowed twists that will catch even the most savvy of readers off-guard.However... The ending is emotionally tone-deaf. It has no respect for the events in the earlier portion of the story, presenting readers with an over-the-top resolution that is intended to be immensely satisfying, yet flies in the face of the grounded narrative the story tries to steep itself into.Regardless, it's definitely worth a read. Harmonia is an experience I won't soon forget. However, in spite of it's good intentions, the ending casts an unfortunate hue on everything building up to it..."

However last third is pretty good and epilogue even forced tears into my eyes a little.Art is pretty, but only 3 characters actualy have sprites. Voice acting is very good and music is fine.I didnt like how story was told in large text blocks over whole screen, having that pretty art covered by text blocks is kind of shame.Overall i liked the game even if it isnt anything special.However, because its new kinetic novel, i cant help, but to compare it to minori's kinetic VNs eden* and Supipara.Thats where Harmonia falls short. Even when you put it next to older eden*, which is closer to Harmonia both in scope and theme, you can see how mutch better eden* is both in storytelling and visuals. You cant even start comparing Harmonia to Supipara, because that game is in entirely another league.So this is positive review, because Harmonia is good game (mutch better then many other VNs with 10€ price tag), but you should also check minori's VNs ! :)"

Everything that was told in the story somehow didn't matter anymore and the conlcusion was just there, out of the blue.

,Recommended,421660,25687468,"Posted: 25 September, 2016",all,Enter_77,"ProsSoundtrack--- Memorable tracks that set the atmosphere for each scene.Art style--- Excellent and sharp. The art in Key's works continues to improve. Subtle movement of the pencil lines in the character CGs is a nice touch.Sound effects--- Effects play in scenes with some action that help enhance the atmosphere.NeutralCharacters--- There are three main characters, not including the main protagonist. While two of them are charming and well written considering the limited time for development, the other has a very disappointing presence in the story. Their arc is quickly resolved within the first half when they could have had a major and more appropriate presence in the finale.As for the main character, his limited personality is due to plot constraints. However, there doesn't seem to be consistency with how he acquires emotions. Some of his epiphanies are repeated which makes the whole process seem irrelevant in the long run despite it playing into the main theme.Writing--- For the most part great and up to the same standard as previous Key novels. In the final few chapters, however, when the plot becomes the main focus of the story instead of the character interactions, a certain group of characters' banter and the main character's internal dialogue is of noticeably lower quality.The main theme of the story is clear, but the message that the reader is told to take away following a certain event is openly repeated through the main character, who up to that point has remained neutral about the state of the world. It would have been best left to the reader to come to their own conclusions about that particular event.ConsOverarching plot & setting--- Not the main point of Harmonia. The main focus is on the characters. The plot itself is nothing new, and when it does become a driving force in the last half, it comes across as more extreme and jarring than what was needed to get the characters to their destinations.Pacing--- While the length on its own (6 hours) is fine, the story pacing suffers as a result, especially towards the end.ConclusionHarmonia is a short, linear novel roughly6 hoursin length. It has everything that Key is renowned for; introspective characters, atmospheric soundtrack, and writing.Harmonia definitely seems like a spiritual successor to Planetarian, Key's other kinetic novel that was roughly the same length. Perhaps too similar. The setting is the same: a post-apocalyptic future where robot servants are struggling to cope with the reality that the remnants of humanity are on an inevitable course for extinction. Even certain plot points are repeated exactly as they occurred in Planetarian.What sets Harmonia apart from Planetarian are the characters. Whereas Planetarian centered on an odd couple, a soldier with no hope for a future and a girl whose mind was stuck in the past when humanity's future still seemed bright, Harmonia brings together a small cast of characters who must come to terms with their limited set of emotions as they interact with one another.The missteps that Harmonia makes are a combination of short length and poor plot decisions. It might have been best to remove one of the characters entirely if only to give more time to the other two. The emotional impact of the finale is still there, just as it has been in other Key novels, but the events immediately leading up to it aren't satisfying and the resolutions to the characters are delivered in rapid succession.Overall, Harmonia is still decent enough to check out if you're a fan of the genre or Key's previous works. Those who played Planetarian may find it a retread and will want to base their decision on how much they enjoyed that story.Unless you're a major fan of Key who can't wait to read this story, it's best tobuy Harmonia when it's on sale."

,Recommended,421660,25683159,"Posted: 24 September, 2016",all,EisenKoubu,"Key's newest VN, Harmonia, has been a long time coming. When it was announced to be coming to Steam in English alongside CLANNAD's English release before being released in Japan, I was excited beyond belief. It was a very unexpected move on VisualArt's part, but a welcome one nonetheless. I knew I would be buying the game Day 1. But the game was constantly delayed due to various conflicts, until finally the game reached the quality VA expected from it.So was Harmonia worth the wait? Well, let's look at the story first. A young Phiroid with no memories of the past awakes from cryogenic sleep, and seeks out civilization in order to find humans to serve. He stumbles across the residence of one Shiona, a priestess who takes him in and names him Rei. Quickly growing attached to Shiona's infectuous smile, he decides to help her as she sings to the townspeople and makes them happy. But there are some in the town who are not as happy, and Rei takes it upon himself to solve their lingering regrets.I won't spoil the rest of the story, but while it does take some pages from previous Key games to make it more accessible to their audience, it does become something all its own. I can at least say that it's a shorter and easier read than Planetarian, although don't let that dissuade you from checking the story out. It's a hard sci-fi story that knows what it wants to do and accomplishes it fairly well, although personally, I've seen this same kind of story before on a few occasions.Each of the four principal characters leaves an impression upon the reader, setting up an allegory to drive the novel's message of cherishing the human trait of emotion. Shiona represents happiness and warmth, Madd represents anger and stubbornness, and Tipi represents sadness and loneliness. Rei is the vessel that receives these feelings and emotions, learning through his own common sense what is good and what is bad for these individuals. Out of all the characters, Tipi is definitely my favorite, and it's not just because she's a loli~ :PThe artwork is unique among Harmonia's elder siblings, as it has more of a stencil drawing feel to it. I praised Sepia Tears for this same unique take on spritework, but Harmonia shows you how the professionals do it. The pencil gradient adorning each character sprite moves subtly, giving them an earthen, sketchy feel. Considering that the outside world is very dirty and polluted in Harmonia, this makes sense storywise. Itaru Hinoue's art in general has always been beautiful regardless of how old the game might be, and while she left VisualArt's a few days ago at the time of this review, this could be counted as a fantastic swan song to her days with Key. I wish her luck in her further endeavors, and hopefully this won't be the last time we see her work in a Key game.The music is also worthy of note. With Key's in-house composer Shinji Orito and freelance prodigy Ryou Mizutsuki at the helm, the soundtrack is almost exactly what I expect from them. The music paints a picture of a desolate world that yearns to a single ray of hope, and it also captures every emotion Rei experiences while in the town or the outside world. I feel Mizutuski's pieces are much better composed than Orito's, and that's usually been the case even in Rewrite, but here it's especially noticeable. Not that Orito's music in this game is bad, but it pales compared to Mizutsuki-san's softer, simpler tracks.Harmonia is not a perfect visual novel by any means, but it's a pretty darn good one. It has every right to stand with its elder brethren in the hearts of many a Key fan, and I'm glad it was brought over to English-speaking countries, even if it took a while to get here. If you are a Key fan, you likely already have this game. But for those who have no clue who Key is or have any passing interest in Key, do I recommend this visual novel to you? Almost certainly yes. Be prepared to cry, though. This is one journey you will not come back from emotionally unscathed. :)"

It shares a lot of the same themes and was good overall, although it was rather slow for the first few hours and by the time it did get better, it was almost over. It's tough to say as to whether or not I recommend it because it ultimately feels like an inferior Planetarian. That could be just because I had finished Platerian first but that's how I felt. Overall it was a good visual novel that is fairly short and can be finished in a single sitting much like Planetarian, although in my opinion, it isn't as good."

Rewrite and Little Busters! are some of my favorite games of all time (despite them just being Visual Novels). I have played most, if not all, of the Key Visual novels (aside from the extremely heavy adult ones because playing the 18+ version of Kanon almost ruined one of my favorite characters.).When I heard about Harmonia, I was pretty excited to see that It would be getting an official English release on steam, not that it matters to me since I can competently read Japanese.  With English being my native tough, however, there are certainly times when reading a Japanese text can leave me a little lost (mostly due to slang and wordplay).  Unlike many of the Key library, Harmonia is a Kinetic Novel; you don't have any choices, you just read, look and listen.  Also, like Planetarian before it, it is quite short clocking in at about 3-6 hours depending on how fast you read.The music is quite amazing, as expected of Key; there are some extremely strong tracks here that are very memorable and really good at setting the mood.  The story follows the usual Key formulae of being a ""crying game"".  The first few acts are slow and mainly for character development. The final few acts are where the emotional &quot♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan"", as they say.  The voice acting is superb as expected and the art is very impactful with some panels being extremely vivid and memorable. Character design follows the typical ""moe"" style that Key is known for though don't be fooled; the characters are designed this way so that you will grow attached much easier.  Then when the story decides to rip your heart out of your chest and stamp on it multiple times you will be even more devastated.If you like Key and like visual novels then this is definitely worth it at 7 dollars.

I would recommend this to a first time VN reader.Harmonia is short visual novel with around 6 hours of read time. There are no choices to be made; it's simply a VN to read and experience. One thing I noticed immediately upon starting the game is that the UI seems rather old what with the overlay of text over the entire image. That's not something you see in a lot of VNs released recently. Thankfully, you can remove the text to see the CG or background simply by hitting the spacebar.The art in Harmonia is very pretty apart from one quibble I have; that would be Madd’s sprites. His nose is nonexistent and makes him look extremely unnatural. Everything else is fine and even beautiful, albeit it requires you to suspend your disbelief. For instance, how can Tipi have such long hair and wear such lovely clothes in this dystopian society? I know for sure that I wouldn’t want hair that long in a setting like that…it seems like too much work to take care of when I could be doing something else…but perhaps that is a sign of her true strength.Jokes aside, Harmonia itself is a somewhat sombre game. Whilst there are certainly slice of life elements, it's a tragedy novel at its heart, meant to make you cry. You'll probably be pleased to hear that the ending is actually happy, in a way that fits. It's not overly optimistic but it does fit the themes and it's at least somewhat ""realistic"", as far as realism can go.The plot itself is decent but feels a little too similar to Planetarian. There were plot aspects and scenes I could guess simply from reading that VN previously. And, after reading Harmonia, I can say that in my opinion Planetarian is the better of the two, but your mileage may vary. Some aspects that seemed very strange while first reading Harmonia make sense later on after finishing the story and understanding everything.The characters in Harmonia are competently written, though they don't have an astounding amount of depth and some are rather unabashedly cliche.The soundtrack is hit or miss. Some tracks were very beautiful and fitting to the scene, while I simply didn't care for others.Overall, Harmonia is a decent visual novel that is a nice read, though I personally think Planetarian would be a better pick even with its shorter length."
,Recommended,421660,35214531,Posted: 25 September,all,Kardar,Harmonia is one of those really short visual novels I genuinely enjoyed from the beginning to the end. Key always does a wonderful job at keeping pace and engaging the reader with great dialogue and story. Harmonia is not an exception. I highly recommend this for a short but emotional ride!
