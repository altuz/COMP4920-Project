,Recommended,421670,29598745,Posted: 30 January,all,CookieCrisp,"Cupid is not for the faint of heart. It's a dark, gritty, tainted look at love. It takes what we see, and throws it on itself. But is it worth a play?Yes, absolutely.The game is sick. And will make you feel as such, but still, I could not tear myself away.Highly Reccomended."

The content is deep, and really dark sometimes, and the topics goes from certain humans ideals to sexuality, friendship,Loveand self-conciousness, so this is not for everyone that not have at least a basicresponsibility of thinkingto explore the game and the differents routes.The english is a fancy and elaborated one, so be patience.The game is FREE so take a hint of culture and deep thinking and read it, because the Music is a classic and elite one.PD1: Don't mind my play time because i finish it in my vacations in off-line mode, like a pillow-book jejePD2: Para aquellos habla hispana que sepan ingles tendran que poner esfuerzo (o traductor a mano xD) para lograr entender bien esta VN, pero se las recomiendo, en serio te deja pensando hacia dentro. (y afuera dependiendo del caso)"

,Recommended,421670,30058499,Posted: 20 February,all,t3chnowitch,"I'm really not sure how to describe my feelings about this game.  I guess, at the risk of sounding like a paid ""critic"" from gaming mags of bygone years, I could only accurately describe ""CUPID"" as...compelling.  It's an odd sort of feeling, playing this game.  It wasn't comfortable or enjoyable in the least, but the story that unfolded was interesting enough to quell the repulsion.  Fortunately I am down with the Romantic movement and all things terrible and sublime, so this unsettling feeling was right up my alley.  Seeing that it has multiple endings adds a bit of longevity to an otherwise extremely short game.  The question is, am I enough of a jackass to pursue them all at the expense of the poor protagonist?All in all, a great game for those with a fascination for the emotionally grotesque."

When you first play through the story is a bit confusing, but that's what makes trying to get all the endings and the achievements worth it. Each reveals more of the story and gives you a better understanding of all the crazy going on. :D"

,Recommended,421670,29772034,Posted: 7 February,all,fey_elija,"When I saw that you could play this game for free, I thought it were just a silly romance novel that would keep my mind occupied for some hours and that's all I wanted really. In the end, though, this visual novel (don't expect a game, it's a novel as it clearly says in the title) actually had a deep and involving story to tell that had me enthralled and left me thinking about it hours, days and weeks later."

Aside from this warning, this visual warning is amazing!!!I cannot help but congratulate the people tha made this game! It is so well-written, so good to the eye, the music is terrific and the plot really got me addicted to this game. I really enjoyed it. That is why I strongly recommend it to people who want to get addicted to this twisted dark fairytale. :)"

,Recommended,421670,29401850,Posted: 21 January,all,Aria Theo,"Cupid is easily one of the best VNs on Steam, and free to boot. The story is engrossing, with tons of surprising twists and a cast of fascinating, believable characters."

,Recommended,421670,29950956,Posted: 15 February,all,vankasteelj,"I'd recommend this for a slow evening. Follow the journey of a shy girl with deamons, in a world where not everyone wants to be your friend. It's well written, beautifully crafted and with some twists. Go ahead, and give it a try !"
,Recommended,421670,29878774,Posted: 12 February,all,Staghoul 👻,"Well, this wasn't at all what I expected. The story is really, really weird. Something I never expected, and it was amazing. The story itself is so well put together and words can't really describe how I feel about it.I originally got the 3rd ending, which is REALLY screwed up. You'll know what I mean if you get it.If want to read something different, then this is definitely the visual novel for you, and it's free, so there's no harm in trying it. The soundtrack is great, and the way the game just throws you into some of the darker parts, in my opinion it's just really well done."
,Recommended,421670,29914745,Posted: 13 February,all,ledeir,"Seeing as how its Valentines day, I felt it was an appropriate time to review this game.I have yet to achieve 100% completion on it, having only played through once so far, but I indeed to do so.For a free visual novel its fairly well done. In fact, if suffers from the opposite problem of most freebies, its too long!The story is interesting, dark, and well done, but it really started to drag on after a while.Playing as ""Mother"" rather than any of the characters directly involved was a particularly nice approach that I haven't seen before.Give it a try, just be prepared for some disturbing scenes."

,Recommended,421670,30181823,Posted: 25 February,all,zeroliken,"Here's another interesting VN that got my attention. Certainly not for the faint of heart, this mature visual novel will leave you intrigued with its theme. Play it all the way through and see ALL the endings, secret ending and epilogue for the full experience.Really recommend this if you want to dive into the dark side of love."
76561198197896761,Recommended,421670,30155071,Posted: 24 February,all,trueangelcool,"One question why is this not a paid VN?I ask this question because this VN was really good to play through.Let's just say that I loved everything about this VN. I love the characters, art, music. BG, and storyline. Quite honestly it's tough to pick out which is my favorite in this VN. If I had to pick out my favorite it would be the very lovely soundtrack which was very good to listen too. I loved the parts where the music would get creepy as ♥♥♥♥ at times. They did a good job with the creepy soundtrack parts:)As others have said this VN is not for the faint of heart. This VN has a lot of dark themes.I don't usually play sad/dark themed visual novel's a lot but man this VN was just that good even for me to play.Oh I also enjoyed the bonus content in this VN. I wish there was more in the bonus content to play through.There is also a mature filter Off/ON which having in means less and off means more. Actually to unlock all images u have to play both mature filter Off/On.100% play this VN if u don't mind the sad/dark themes of Cupid."
