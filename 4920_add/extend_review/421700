I see no end to this spread of cancer as long as weeaboos and idiots like myself keep buying these titles that are simply copy / paste. They most likely have no intentions of improving their games, they rush these baztard babies out drooling as they think of the money they can make.Protip to the Developers: Move on to new things, not even the 10 year old weeaboos will buy this sh*t forever. At least go out with some bit of dignity before everyone else finally realize that they've been buying the same game every time, before everyone jumps on the ""hate"" wagon and start demanding for actual quality. You need to know when to back out, before this goes too far and you morons start releasing games for every season and for every holiday there is.I think that most rational people can see by now that these games are only giving a bad reputation for the Visual Novel Genre. Go buy Clannad for fifty bucks, might be five times more expensive but it's also fifty times better than any Sakura game ever.I can only imagine what the future of Winged Cloud will look like:>Sakura Easter>Sakura 9/11>Sakura kill yurself>Sakura suicide school>Sakura pls buy our games>Sakura please let this series die alreadyI mean, we all love waifus, breasts and butts but, just please..LET IT DIE FOR GODS SAKE, LET IT DIE.

With Christmas arriving in a week's time and no family member, friend or sibling to spend the holiday with, Koji decides to go out of his apartment to make an offering at a local shrine and wish for someone to spend the Christmas with. Afterwards, he will meet a fox spirit Akina who lives around the shrine and has heard his wishes, his middle school friend Itsumi who was handing out fliers for a cafe she is currently working at and Santa Claus's daughter who also goes by the same name of Santa Claus where Koji will help to find and recover her lost candy cane magic wand. Over the course of this visual novel, Koji can choose to visit the same or a different person each day before eventually spending Christmas Day with one or all of them.The story and plot is written like a romantic comedy with a share of humour and fanservice and has 4 nice happy endings, the background music by REN from the circle 'Bastat tail', artwork by Inma and Badriel and overall presentation are great. Reading through the storyline and dialogue and unlocking all CGs at gallery will take less than 10 hours. Highly recommended when at discount or bundle offer for fans of Winged Cloud who might be interested in collecting the titles in the Sakura series and the great artwork in the trading cards, badges, emoticons and profile artwork in this game and for those who are interested in showcasing a Christmas-themed background on Steam profile."

I'll admit, these games are super cheesy and serve one purpose; however, the previous versions in the Sakura series had steam cards, actual characters, real conflicts, decent (albeit cheesy) plot/story.I think one of the major complaints about the Sakura games was that the choices didn't really affect much, but in this one, you consistently have 3 choices that lead you onto 4 different paths. That sounds cool, right? Wrong. The paths are just as formulaic, uninteresting, and identical as the other.The artwork for this game was drastically different, and I did not think it was for the better. There were less scenes overall, and the human artwork looked way worse than any of the other ones so far.Sakura Spirit had mysteries to solve and each of the 4 girls had character. Sakura Swim Club was dark in nature and had much better dialog. Sakura Angels and Sakura Fantasy were a bit underwhelming compared to the previously mentioned 2, but holy smokes, they blow Sakura Santa out of the water.Definitely not purchasing any more Winged Cloud products that come out following this one if this is the direction that they're taking."

76561198123412640,Recommended,421700,28641664,"Posted: 25 December, 2016",all,Sam Lilly,"Sakura Santa is a visual novel by Winged Cloud for computers, available on Steam. The reason I'm reviewing this because it is available on Steam in the context that it is, in fact, a game. As this is the first one I'm talking about in the Sakura series, I guess I should explain a little bit about the series in general. Basically, this is an ongoing series of visual novel games, not necessarily related to one another, that seem to rely heavily on sexualized anime women and suggestive situations. They usually also involve some type of fantasy element to their setting and story. As visual novels, they don't have much in the way of gameplay, but they will often have sections where you can choose from branching paths in the story. To be honest, the real reason I want to start talking about these is because I tend to enjoy them far too much. Then again, this IS a Christmas game so the timely release of this review feels a bit more justified... even if it feels just as perverted. As it is a visual novel, the story is most of the content, but I'll try to keep from spoilers as best I can.In Sakura Santa you play as a university student named Koji. He's new to the town and doesn't have any friends there yet. It's almost Christmas and he has no one to spend it with. His family are all busy with their own plans even. So he wanders off to a nearby shrine. He helps a and elderly, injured priest there with the upkeep of the place before making an offering and making a wish. He wishes for a cure for his loneliness. He then finds himself in the company of a fox spirit named Akina, who also resides at the shrine, that wants to repay his pure kindness. She asks him to come back and see her again. Afterwards he goes into town and runs into an old childhood friend, Itsumi, that coincidentally works at a cafe in town. She also hasn't made much for friends in this place so she wants to catch up with Koji. She doesn't think she'll have the time with the holiday rush at the cafe, but Koji offers to help out there in order to spend some time with her. Also in town he accidentally bumps into a girl dressed up in some festive wear that claims to be Santa. She's trying to find her magic wand that she has lost. Koji helps her find it and as a thank you she offers to visit him when she's not busy getting ready for Christmas. Three girls in one day. Thus, the stage is set.The way the story unfolds after this introduction is up to you. With each day you get to select from three different activities, each one corresponding to one of the girls. You decide who to spend your time with on each day. The amount of time you spend with each will affect how the story goes. There are general models for each character, along with a few poses and expressions that will change now and then to fit the current situation and dialogue. However, there are also a few specific scenes where you'll get to see a specific image drawn, typically a quite suggestive one at that. So playing through multiple times with different paths can get you some new images as well as an alternate story. It's up to you to decide how you want to spend your Christmas. Only one thing is certain: You won't be spending it alone.My main interest in the game is pretty obvious. I saw hot anime girls. I couldn't resist. I do think their designs are quite cute and sexy. Beyond that, I actually thought the characterization was alright in this one. I mean, there are still times when the characters can feel unbelievable in some of the things they say or do, but they seem to act and react in a relatable manner. No one feels like they make no sense at all. I find this especially true of the protagonist this time around. Koji has moments of both strength and weakness, but always seem to be honest with himself about at least. I really appreciated it. It has a few nice features for convenience too. You can hit the skip button upon replaying the game so it will skip all previously read dialogue quickly until you get to something new or a choice. There's a gallery too, which has pictures unlock once you see them from playing the game so you can go back and gawk at them anytime you want. I also think each of the three main stories worked well enough to be entertaining. I also liked how easy it was to follow each specific storyline. If you want to spend your time with Akina then you pick the top choices. If you want to spend time with Itsumi then you pick the middle choices. If you want to spend time with Santa then you pick the bottom choices. It's simple. If you split your time evenly then you'll get another outcome and series of events.This story path is rather strained. The others all followed somewhat of the same story beats, but they at least worked well enough to seem relatively realistic to the context. In this one, however, it seems like all the girls start going crazy. Each one wants Koji's attention and also his love. They start saying things that don't feel natural even to their character, much less that of a normal human being. They turn mean on each other and are a constant struggle. The worst part is that the conflict isn't even resolved in any way. The story here just ends with the girls still fighting over an indecisive guy. Other complaints are probably more minor. There are a few typos here and there. You can tell what they meant to put but those are still a little flaw. It may not be the strongest story if you're used to more in-depth visual novels and are only checking it out for the story itself. A lot of the story has to repeated in order to see all the content, and sometimes it can feel a bit disconnecting because of that. There's even a red herring choice at the start of the game that DOES affect a small bit of dialogue but doesn't affect the progression of the story or the gallery completion. Doesn't seem necessary. And as I mentioned before, this is a visual novel so there's not much for gameplay. You just make choices and... I guess masturbate if that counts as part of the game. So on that front, it's a pretty terrible GAME.Yet, Sakura Santa is still a fun experience that I'd recommend. It's nice Christmas-themed visual novel that managed to keep the theme alive without sacrificing what you come to a Sakura game for. Besides, it's always nice to feel like you're making some type of connection with the girls you're fapping to. It makes it feel a little less meaningless than porn... even if it's about the same. A google image search just doesn't have the same feeling. It does what it sets out to do pretty well and I'll applaud it on that. Oh, so THAT'S the sound of one hand clapping. But seriously, it's not too bad of a time if you know what you're getting into and want to get into that. It's a bit like fap bait, except that once you're in you'll still have something to fap to. So the advertising is pretty honest. Get it on sale if nothing else. It's worth a few bucks if you're the type to appreciate it. Just... try not to feel too weird about wanting to bone Santa.https://youtu.be/bC0TB4SFKYU"

,Not Recommended,421700,20578385,"Posted: 16 January, 2016",all,Michael_SK,"Not as great as you would expect...After I played Sakura Swim Club (the hentai version not on Steam, giggity), I thought that the other Sakura games before it had so much to offer. I am beginning to really question that after playing the latest Sakura game: Sakura Santa. Unlike Sakura Swim Club, there are 4 different endings instead of 1. The problem I see is that it's way to simple to get these endings.You basically have to spend the most time with one of the three girls to get their ending or spend an equal amount of time with them to get the harem ending.The simplicity in achieving these endings makes the game seem way more cheap and under-developed it is for the price you pay.There is some decision-making... but no conversation decision-making, which is another disappointment. The dialogue throughout this game is also dry and unrealistic, making it a drag to read (especially out loud for a playthrough). I'd have to say the only good thing about this game is the artwork, which is as great as Sakura Swim Club's artwork. The music was okay for this game, but I prefer Sakura Swim Club's soundtrack. The character designs in dialogues are kind of weird in my opinion and seem copied from Sakura Swim Club. The stories were great and are even better if you enjoy child-like fiction.I enjoyed playing this game, but didn't like how much of a setback this was compared to Sakura Swim Club. It's a pricy game for how under-developed and poorly worked on it is especially without any hentai/nudity, meaning I don't recommend buying this game even if it weren't on sale. It isn't worth it and there are better stories to experience out there on Steam and on the internet."

This is either good or bad depending on your tastes I suppose. That said, the story has a myriad of branching paths so you can play it over and over to find new things... though I personally just used the skip feature to fastforward my way until I hit something new. I was pleasantly surprised at how many little nuances there are depending on how you choose to progress.Also it might be the funniest and cutest one of these games I've played yet. It's hardly a deep, maturely written novel, but I found it very charming in its own way.If you want this kind of ""game"" I'd say it's definitely worth it on sale, and maybe even at full price.P.S.

,Recommended,421700,19957920,"Posted: 26 December, 2015",all,Quibber123,"Two things first:1. This game now references objects that have appeared in other Sakura games which means that the ""Sakura Universe"" is actually a thing now with the games taking place in the same world. Incredible or terrifying? You decide.2. This game breaks away from the standard oblivious male main character to one who understands advances immediately then proceeds to reference itself by having the main character say he doesn't understand how harem protagonists are that dense. Hilarious or poor attempt at self-referential humor? You decide.Sakura Santa might be the ""best"" of the Sakura titles to date. It does everything you expect out of a Sakura game without insulting the player like the recent Beach titles have done, it thankfully doesn't use the same/poor/unfunny trope jokes every other line (aside from all three girls being shameless/oblivious/finding themselves in suddenly lewd situations) like Beach 2 abused, every character doesn't have a tragic backstory, the ecchi scenes aren't as forced feeling as they were in some of the previous titles (they still are of course it still is the genre after all), and like the other Sakura titles it ends on a light-hearted note with a message about the importance of friends and/or family or what-have-you.The artist in this one is Inma again (same as beach), but when the characters are wearing clothes the art is actually much better than in the beach series. Go figure.The music is decent too. The loops are still short and aren't seamless, but the overall ""listenability"" of the tracks is pretty okay.The choices do matter in this one changing large chunks of the story up, but since you can mix up the different parts of the story you're able to do almost all the choices in one route. A lot of smaller side conversations do change though depending on the order you take and they are all actually fairly well done and can be completely missed which is a huge plus from the previous titles. Genuinely fantastic work on that part I was impressed with it considering how the trend was basically ""fewer or  basically meaningless"" choices the last two games.The comedy is actually vastly improved in this one too with brilliant lines like:""I knew that foxes couldn't be trusted especially foxes with huge boobs and nice thighs.""""H.P. Lovecraft's stories all discussed Eldritch abominations, but did he ever contemplate the panties of a fox girl?""*Right after Sexy Santa comes in through your window in the afternoon* ""Why didn't you just use the door?"" ""I got nervous so I took the easiest route to your apartment."" ""Okay. That's fair enough.""And the best one of the bunch:""Dads always have the best ideas""Simply brilliant.It also ends with a nice Merry Christmas note from the devs so Merry Christmas Winged Cloud!Can I recommend this game? You pretty much know if you like this series by now. I can definitely say that this one is the best Sakura game if only for the ""Three Moe Stooges"" harem ending but is that really saying much? If you only like the Sakura games for being porn though (No one actually does or things that this is what they are about right?) you'll be disappointed."

It was A LOT more in the line of lovey-dovey than hot-and-stuffy like Sakura Swim Club. If your seeking a game that has ""great character and action"" I wouldn't reccomend this one.However, the story (or at least the one I played before writing this review) is actually kind of alright. I actually kinda got a little attached to Akina. Though I will say, one of her scenes are a MAJOR kick in the christmas magic from the developer. I'm gonna hold that against him for sure. I guess if your looking for attachable characters and an okay story then this games for you. Just don't whip it out during, you'll be disappointed. I guarantee it."

Actually being able to make choices that can change what girl you get was refreshing in the Sakura series, as for the girls in this game they are all top tier women. You basically get to choose between a foxgirl, childhood friend, and Santa. The Santa one is a little awkward though because you are running around calling a big breasted chick Santa. This new art style is pretty great too."
