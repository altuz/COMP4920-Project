It's the best game-playing I've had in a long time.On the plus side, the story is tantalizing.  As you find objects, clues, story lines, you just get pulled more and more into the game.  The story does not have much interaction with other characters but that, in a way, is preferable.  It lets you work at your own speed and explore the many facets of the scenes while you piece together the bits of knowledge and things you uncover.  You never know what item may be helpful so you really get a chance to thoroughly inspect the fantastically rendered artwork of the game.For me, it had some negatives, too.  It's a dark story in a dark setting.  I'm not a person drawn to death/dying/dark/sad games as I don’t think death should be fodder for entertainment.  No, I’m not a squeaky-clean member of the pep squad who wants all sunshine and rainbows.  It’s just that when I play a game, I want to escape to a better or more interesting place than where I am now.  The game setting is definitely interesting so I did enjoy the playing of the game.  I just kept hoping that there would be some sort of retribution, vindication, or salvation for the character(s) I came to care for.Overall, I am glad I played the game because it is beautifully rendered and thoughtful game play.  I may have to play something a bit lighter now to perk up my mood but I do recommend it for gamers who like to solve puzzling games and mysteries."

I finished the game in about 11 hours while following a walkthrough, and i must admit i found some puzzles to be on the difficult side of things. Many hints were not 100% clear and i kept having to refer to the walkthrough.The artwork is supurb, i really like the detailed enviornments both inside the manor, and in the other areas of the game. Especially when you move through the black and white photo worlds later in the game.The story is not straightforward, you must piece it together via your Codex. This again is where a walkthrough can come in handy.I do wish that the map had certain rooms labeled when you hover over them. It can get confusing to remember where everything is.The music was nicely done, but the game is saturated with music themed puzzles, and i found the organ puzzle in particular to be a royal pain.Overall, I'd give it an 8/10. It is a worthy buy if you like adventure games, and the price point is fair for the playtime you get out of it. Multiple endings are a nice touch.Well done!"

Despite its potential, however, the game quickly becomes muddled with overly roundabout puzzles, unnecessary objects, endings that didn't deliver, and reading points that, unusually for me, were too long and just not engaging.There's so much going for this game and if it's on sale, give it a go, but fair warning, it's a bumpy ride."

I'm a sucker for 'old style' point and click having started gaming with the Myst series, and this was amoung the best I've tried since then. I'm an impatient gamer generally, but found myself more than happy to take my time with this, absorbing the atmosphere, exploring the beautifully drawn settings and solving the many puzzles which ranged from fairly straightforward to  fienndishly tricky. In general, the puzzles are very satisfying to solve, although not always obvious - it often didn't dawn on me until later in the game that things were part of the puzzles - but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It certainly makes you think (and I admit to resorting to the walkthrough towards the end).I had no problems running the game; no bugs while I used it.There is a lot to read, and notes will likely help although most everything you need is stored for you in your journal and in the codex, and there's no voice acting (which might be considered a plus compared with some games) but that fits with the story and feel of the game.So - if you like point and click, relish a challenge, and don't mind putting in the effort, this is an absorbing, atmospheric and satisfying way to spend a fair few hours.

Everything is broken, dead, or decaying. How long has it been? What happened? Where is everyone? As it should be in any good adventure game, the story sucks you right in. Finding answers only leads to more questions at first, and you slowly begin to unravel the tragic tale of a town ravaged by war and a family that unknowingly brought on its own demise.A quick search on Wikipedia told me this: Goetia is a practice that includes the invocation of angels or of demons. And indeed, you quickly discover that these people have seen more than their fair share of supernatural beings.This is a pretty standard premise, and most horror fans will have seen it many times. However, it is so superbly done in this game that you won't mind. By the end of the story, I had no questions left at all. Everything made perfect sense. That's a rare and impressive feat.A great example of this is your character's amnesia. Amnesia is a condition we see all too often in games, and in many cases, there is no real reason, besides the developer not knowing how to explain things properly. That is not the case here. You don't find out until very late in the game, but you have amnesia for a very good, logical reason. And when you find out, many pieces of the puzzle fall into place. The many letters and journals you find throughout your journey are similarly well-written. You really get to know all the people who once lived here, because their journals and notes all show distinctly different personalities. For point-and-click games, the writing is arguably the most important part, and it was done very well here.Pros:+ A lot of value for the low price+ Excellent story+ Gorgeous environmentsCons:- No hint system- Puzzles get very difficult- Some backtracking is necessaryRead my full review here:http://www.keengamer.com/article/15207_goetia-review"

It was a real head-scratcher at times, and my husband would chuckle as he looked in on me at my computer with a notepad scrawled with a bunch of sketches and information.  I love a puzzle game that makes you get out tools in the real world in order to solve the mysteries.I can proudly say that I solved all of the puzzles with only consulting a walkthrough 4 times.  And in two of those occassions it was due to a mechanic of the puzzle that I didn't realize could be done (clicking on the text or drawings while looking at a page).  I will have to say that some of the puzzles are extremely difficult -- a lot of the in-game hints are highly obscure, and on one occassion with a puzzle I ended up solving it based on some hair-brained idea, and I still don't know what in-game hint would have helped me solve it.If you love games like Myst, Riven, The Room, etc., then this is definately a game for you!"

Visuals are good, suspense is strong, and to wander in a dilapidated manor can be creepy.It's difficult to decide whether to recommend it or not, but maybe I should give the development a chance to improve on their future works. The main problem with the game, is lack of clues.For example, in the basement of the church tower, you must input Anton's name. You can find out the symbols of A, N and C, but there is no where in the game you can find symbols standing for P, E and W. I guess you have to find more about the Rune on internet? And after relieving Anton, you must input with the same typewritter the name of the church founder. I am quite sure there is no clue in the game asking you to do that. This puzzle is out of nowhere. I make it through by referring to the walkthrough often. It is frustrating."

I have not ever been into this kind of games, but this one is unique enough to try it out. The graphics (or rather, photography) and the enviroments are amazing, with a gloomy, lonely feel. The puzzles are very well crafted, they have introduced me to code systems that makes Silent Hill 3's puzzle hard mode seem easy in comparison.I cheated a little at the end asking for help, but trust me that you that it feels extremely rewarding to do it for yourself. Also, one of the best aspects for the game is to do everything at your own pace, because once you advance 2 hours in the game, the map expands a lot, giving access to 4 additional stages and more sectors of the mansion, which you can all explore with little to no barriers...this is a thing that many lineal adventure games should be learning from : allow the player to explore freely.Oh, and it manages to do all that while being PEGI 7"

They're rare though, and they make sense in hindsight (unlike some of Monkey Island's...).

It is a simple ""point and click"" with a twist. You play as the spirit of a dead girl and can move thru walls...at least as long as they're not blocked by sigils or if you've possessed somethig that then makes you somewhat solid.The story is quite in depth and involved and spread out over several chapters. There is a Codex or ist of things you have looked at or taken which helps you solve some of the many puzzles. There is a journal that automatically tracks your progress and gives you some idea of what to do next without really giving anything away and also lets you know when you have completed a level. There's also a map that you can use as you progress to quickly get from spot to spot, otherwise there can be a lot of floating from screen to screen to screen, etc.  The graphics are very ncie and the music is simple and soothing. A few of the ""effects"" are a little cheesy, but does not distract from the story or the game. During the game you gather or read many documents so that you do have a reasonble idea of the story line.I only have one complaint. It has to do with some of the puzzles.  I've been playing these kinds of games since the original Myst came out so I'm really comfortable with making deductive leaps or conenctions to solve most puzzles. It's not that I never reach for the walkthru, but it's rare. In at least a couple of instances, I knew ""what"" to do, but not how to do it. I reread the information that I had and carefully looked at the environment, but in the end I had to go get a hint. After reading the hint, I was left thinking ""hmm OK, that sort of makes sense, but I guess I don't know why I would have assumed that was the way to solve the puzzle"". It's like the developer was thinking one way, but didn't, at least from my perspective, put forth anything that would have taken me down that same path.This is an extension of my original  review. I have finally finished the game. Unfortunately I had to use the walkthru several times in the end to solve some of the more obtuse puzzles. I will once again reitrate that I think the puzzles are one of this games best points and one of its worst. For example, I used a hint to solve the barrel organ puizzle.  Once I knew the secret of it, it was plain that I just hadn't invested enough time into the puzzle and it was one that I should have been able to solve on my own.  But a couple of others (sorry no spoilers) just weren't evident to me that the item that gave the solution went with that puzzle or that the solution didn't seem to make logical sense - in other words, I'm not sure I would have ever figured it out..While I doubt that I'll do a replay of the game,  over all I thintk it's a great game and would recomemnd it."
,Recommended,421740,29201029,Posted: 12 January,all,Mouse,"One of the most complex, innovative puzzle adventures of the last decade. In a genre which has largely given way to hackneyed point and click, hidden object and inventory combination puzzles, Goetia takes a step sideways and harks back to an era that did not play dumb to its audience. While frustrating at times due to some issues in puzzle design, Goetia should be on every puzzle adventure enthusiast's wishlist.The graphics and gameplay are simple but atmospheric and engaging. The audio is rudimentary, but is underpinned by a haunting soundtrack that adds depth to the mystery of Blackwood Manor. Particularly innovative is the use of object possession by the protagonist (Abigail, a spirit). The player must switch between playing as incorporeal Abigail, to functioning in the world as a physical object - each option changing the possibilities and physics of the game.The puzzles are satisfying complex. However, the game most likely suffers from a lack of playtesting. Many of the puzzles are practically unsolvable without brute force (or using one of the available walkthroughs). This is normally not the result of poorly designed puzzles (though in some cases the answers are too sensitive or bugged), but more often due to extremely vague hints and misleading coincidences. If the developers were to address some of the ambiguity surrounding certain puzzles, the game would run smoothly and without undue frustration for the player.The mystery of Blackwood Manor is certainly engaging. Set against a backdrop of World War II, the player is able to explore several extensive locations in order to piece together the whereabouts of Abigail's missing family. While the number of screens could easily overwhelm the player, the game comes with a helpful map (which flashes with Abigail's current location - a helpful retroactively added feature). The player is able to use this map to teleport to certain locations, removing the frustration of clicking through a large number of screens to investigate something new. However, objects are not able to be teleported.The number of screens and objects is seemingly enormous, removing the temptation to try each object with each hotspot (though you may feel tempted if stuck). Unfortunately, the objects are easily misplaced, and the game has no way of tracking them. With objects as small as pens and screwdrivers and no way of knowing which will be important down the track, this can quickly become a frustrating time sink. No walkthrough can save you here.Cut-scenes are seamlessly integrated into the game, momentarily losing control of Abigail in the presence of Goetia demons or other figures. The Goetia invocation itself adds another layer of realism and history to the game, using sigils and real demonology to underpin the puzzles. This itself lends a certain believability to the presence of the puzzles in the first place, and the neurotic privacy with which the Blackwoods guard their secrets.While decked out with a sophisticated and intriguing storyline, the resolution and final twist is somewhat of a let-down. The final scene happens in a rush, and the pay-off is not really foreshadowed satisfyingly by the lead up. Though heavy with emotion and themes of human folly, players may find themselves unable to sympathise with the plight of Abigail as the narrative comes to an abrupt close."

This might be due to the developer being French, perhaps it was translated into English. Some scenes contain many visual elements you can get a description of and I have seen instances where the order you view them in might have flowed more smoothly. So far the story is interesting, thought a bit terrifying. There is some question as to what happened to the children of your older sister and I am certain that will be central to the final story.At the beginning you are somewhat restricted in which parts of the manor you can visit, but it opens up in the first two hours of play. I like the way additional parts of the manor have to be unlocked.The game runs well. I can maintain 1080p at 60fps. The background audio gets a bit monotonous. In the end it is probably better to have the ambient sounds than music, but the game tells you at the beginning that sound is important. So far there has been only a single sound which was important to hear, and your character responds to it in text anyway.I can recommend the game if you enjoy point-and-click adventures and are not put off my reading a lot of text.

When she finds them (in pairs) they go automatically to the Nexus. After that she can go to a secret passage to confront Malphas, a demon that is a bird for the last time. Her soul can go through paintings and holes in the walls. The player can have access to the journal (key J) and the Codex (Key C), to see and read all documents in the game. The sound has an important role in the game. The creators advise the use of headphones. I think that is important that a player plays different kinds of games. Buy this game and be prepared to live a new experience, like I did."

I loved the dark theme, the music, and the very investigative feel along with the codex.   But, the puzzles level of quality varied a lot in this game and some are quite abstract without even a few extra hints of guidance that are much needed.   Also, I am not musically inclined and there are a handful of puzzles that require you to know the basics of sheet music.Overall, if the game is on sale and you are ok with a mixture of figuring it out and then using a walk thru as to not go insane, give it a try.

The majority of the plot revolves around dismissing several demons from your family's manor while piecing together what has happened since your death.

The game also does a good job of giving you several options on where to go, however it can become overwhelming when trying to remember what was where.The game does go on a bit too long, and you'll find yourself stuck on a handful of less-than-logical puzzles.

The storyline is interesting, but not interesting enough that it motivates me to push through the game. The controls for me, no matter what I do, seem to split between my keyboard and my controller. The puzzles aren't exactly hard, but I've had to run to a walkthrough more than once simply because of how convuluded and back and forth things are. Some puzzles I just don't know how you'd know what you objective was if you didn't use a walkthrough, unless you just sat there and spent hours on the same puzzle. There's a lot of moving back and forth through the same ""levels"" aka rooms in this game. I find myself fairly unmotivated to finish the game. Save system also doesn't always save and you can lose LOADS of game play and progress. If it's on sale and you enjoy puzzles then you'll probably get an OK bang for your buck.

Granted, he was mostly just derping around to check out the game rather than dig into the meat of it, but it prompted me to buy it.I was in love with the art, music, and overall concept before the game even truly started. What an amazing world these lovely developers created!That being said, the gameplay is rather straightforward - You play as the ghost of a young woman named 'Abigail'. The setting is around the late 1930's to early 1940's. You spend your time in the game doing puzzles to piece together an understanding of what has happened to young Abigail, and her family. As a ghost, you can 'float' through walls, and posess objects to further your quest.I will say one last thing before you decide to buy this game - make sure you pay the @#$% attention. Some of these puzzles are not for the feint of heart and require reading and understanding the notes and things that you find in the game. Abigail will also give you clues here and there in her journal, and hints as she 'speaks' to you about an area. Read everything, touch everything - more than once if you have to. One blessing in-game - all areas have their own puzzles. So you're not forced to carry objects from one area to another. One room to another, sure, but not to other areas.Everything leads back to the Blackwood manor...Will you discover the secrets that it holds?10/10 would pull my hair out doing puzzles again."

At first I wasn't sure if I was going to like the POV because it was a sidescroller and I had just finished playing a 360 degree view game.  But I got used to it quickly and really like how the character floats and zips through rooms and countryside.The puzzles are great and none to easy.  At times I found myself quitting the game so I had time to think through the clues and figure out my next steps.  At first, you are limited to a few locations, but after you solve some puzzles more locales open up.  I like that as I become claustrophobic when games have just a few locations to explore.  The character has no inventory but can use items by possessing them.  This works because the items are normally used fairly close to their original location.There is a journal that keeps track of clues and a codex that records all the various texts you encounter.  Both are useful to remind you or give the information t to solve a puzzle.  It takes a while (or for me it did), to figure out the family relationship of the various characters that have left notes and clues.  In fact, I think I am still figuring that out because I am hung up on one puzzle that uses that information.I've run across two problems of a technical nature.  One is resolved and that is related to getting one of my possessed items into a place I couldn't get it out of.  I found some tech help and got that fixed.  The other is that I have some background problems in that the scenes are broken up and I have a black tunnel across the screen.  Frankly, I didn't realize it was a problem as I thought it was an artistic device for certain locations to show I was in a different realm.  So far it hasn't been a problem and it is not at all locations. EDIT:  Background problems resolved.  Had to reload some files and it cleared up the issue.  Yay!I highly recommend this game to anyone that wants to think and work out answers to puzzles.  If you want HOGs or easy linear games, this is not the game for you.

It helps a lot that it has a non-linear structure, which allows you to disconnect and explore when you feel blocked. This creates an engaging world that sucks you in and makes it very difficult to stop playing.The story is interesting and well laid out.

It is evident that the creators put decient effort in storytelling, and if you do read everything on notes, you'll find that this is a delicately written,  engating story with twisted ending and siganificant indications for humanistic thoughts on warfare and the future of mankind. However, I find that the tasks and puzzles from the midway through started to be far-fetched and some (for sake of not spoiling the story, I won't mention those puzzles) unnecessary. This is particular true somewhere near the end of the story.There are some shortcomings of the game design not exclusive to this game, but very common to the similiar kinds. E.g. the repetition of characters' lines without updates after the progress of the story. This is usually found in the indication bubble of an object. Say, I found something for the first time in the game, and by clicking on the object, the indication says xxxxx, but after I solved the puzzle, and return to the same object, it says exactly the same line which is no longer relevant to the story at that point, and sometimes, the un-updatableness of indication bubbles caused some confusions to me as I did not understand if I still need it or not.I started to lose patience till 2/3 of the game as the puzzles were challenging but not in a logical way, and I couldn't go further with the story and got stuck by the puzzles.However, having said that, with the price I paid during super sale, I'm satisfied with the game, but not excited about it. I do recommend the game as the story is pretty deep if you really try to analyse it as literature, and I understand the creation of a game is far less as easy as writing a review."

I really liked this game.You play the ghost of a little girl that goes back to her family's manor. She finds it abandoned and she has to find out what has happened.Great soundtrack.Hard puzzles. Too hard. Ridiculously hard sometimes. Some requires knowledge in music theory and a musical ear.So many rooms and so many mazes, it's easy to get completely lost if you do not pay a lot of attention and make sure to take notes."

Overall the atmosphere is marvelous and the story very rich."

It's not one of my strenghts. Other than that I enjoyed the story, the atmosphere, the music, and there were a few nice puzzles.So if you don't mind having to give up and use a walkthrough in order to solve some of the more illogical puzzles of the game, I'd say go for it.  When it's on sale."
