,Recommended,421810,19704683,"Posted: 14 December, 2015",all,FluffyMikeB,"I don't do reviews for most of the games I play on Steam. But some games are just too special NOT to give an opinion on.OH! RPG! is a 'launch' title for the newly released RPGMaker MV. Because MV is new (at the time the game came out) the graphics, sound, music, etc, are fresh and the dev put a lot of effort into making it professional.This isn't your typical RPGMaker game. This isn't a cash grab done in 10 hours and released with no care.As I said, the dev put in a lot of work. The maps are full of life but nothing is wasted. The paths in the dungeons are never so conviluted that you get lost. The story is top notch. You can beat the game in less than 5 hours but the 'Heroes' are complex, the NPCs that you control are quirky in the right ways, and even the actual NPCs are more deep than ""welcome to our city"".The battle system is great. This is no button masher, where you just hit attack until the enemy dies. Each chapter's character has their own moveset that MUST be used with strategy in order to get by. The bosses especially must be defeated by thought, not by brute force.The Devs on this project are very friendly, take a look at the discussion forum for OH! RPG! and you will see they are active and willing to talk about bugs, story, suggestions for additions, or anything else you wish to shoot the breeze about. This is a quality I can't value enough. Many devs forget the player exists once their money has been spent.Weakpoints? As mentioned before, you can and prob will beat this game in less than 5 hours. So, take this game for what it is. It is a short but extremely fun RPG with replay value as you have a score for each chapter that you can go back and raise any time you wish."
,Not Recommended,421810,21282153,"Posted: 17 February, 2016",all,Auxkom,"OH! RPG! tells the story of a group of heroes after failing their quest to save the world, travelling through the game world back to their home places to experience the end of the world with their relatives and loved ones. You as the player will, however, not play as the heroes themselves, as their story has already been written. Instead, you take the role of various NPCs they encounter, which have their own business in mind. With each chapter you will take control over a different person in that game world. The story after the failure of the heroes is pretty much what you'd expect, without big surprises or twists. It gets close to being an actually sad tale, but it ultimately failed to draw me in at the end. I was pretty much left there with a huge question mark over my head before realizing that's all what I'd get.With that in mind, you will never play, level up and equip a character more than for maybe an hour before losing your progress and switching on the next one. It feels very dissatisfying that you only level up, gear up and learn those skills just to face a boss monster 30 minutes later and after defeating it, to start all over on a new character, in a new area, with a new story, and a new boss monster.The graphics are pleasing, even though at some parts of the game my frame rate dropped to around 5 for a few seconds. The sprites are very well done, the skill effects are cool and the soundtrack is particulary great. It fully manages to create the atmosphere it needs for certain areas, like a dark, demon-posessed forest.I have mixed feelings about the gameplay. For one, the combat mechanics are well done. You can upgrade your equipment and your potions to make them stronger. The RPG elements and character progression are there and feel very real, but this is the crucial thing I dislike about OH! RPG!: They aren't. Nothing you do is persistent. Potions and upgrade materials are very limited and are heavily required to face the chapters' various bosses, thus creating a very linear experience in a game of a genre that's actually known for player's freedom. There are no shops in the game, so you gotta stick to what you find in treasure chests.The essence of an RPG is to become stronger, to develop the character in a certain way, but these mechanics have no real meaning in OH! RPG!. Ironic for a game whose name consists for more than 50% of the term ""RPG"".The boss battles are also slightly flawed. The spirtes look cool, and the music is fantastic, no doubt, but some bosses (Yeah I'm looking at you, phoenix) are really tough. Not because the bosses are strong, but because some of them heavily rely on RNG, therefore at certain situations there is nothing you can really do but hope for the boss to not permanently lock you in a stun, blind or other CC while dishing out damage.Overall I enjoyed my time with OH! RPG!. The gameplay is flawed but otherwise well done, the story is interesting (not amazing but good enough to keep you interested), the soundtrack is amazing and the controls are very good, supporting both mouse and keyboard inputs. For three bucks it's definitely worth it, if you're not too much into meaningful character progress.But if I say it's definitely worth it, why is this review negative then? I mean, the overall presentation is pleasing at the end, but I am extremely disappointed that every chapter turned out to be a temporary experience.OH! RPG! has good RPG mechanics, but it doesn't utilize them at all. It's not feeling like an RPG, and most importantly, what makes me sad about this is the fact that it could have been (excuse me) ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. It had such a great potential, but in my opinion it's wasted.If the developer decides to make a prequel in which you can stick to your characters throughout the story instead of just one or two levels, I'd instantly get it, because this game shows some great qualities."

The atsmosphere is quite detailed and intresting. The combat, though at times a little slow, ie the groups of three rats, is intresting with many different abilities. The dialouge is well written and funny.

As I played through the game, I noticed different details that made it more amusing. For instance, as the story progresses, the characters you play actually go down in level.  The puzzles weren't hard, but required a bit of thought.  The various boss battles can definitely be a bit frustrating and require several restarts (fortunately, there is a Retry option which tosses you right back into the battle), but once you figure out the mechanics, all are definitely doable.  The soundtrack is very nice. The developer is active in forums and quickly pushing out bugfixes and updates.  +1 for controller support. That's always a plus in my book."

It needs no grinding as a good story and gives a new perspective.But really why can't they get a final boss right.Up to this guy you could beat every boss and enemy fair and sqare even without using your hero call. But nooooo. They had to take the ""let's make a boss that can only be beaten by sheer luck since he has an instakill move you can't really do anything against"".I tried to beat him like 50 times and he allways pulled out the instakill attack after a while. I even tried looking it up on the internet but all the tips didn't work so I can't get to the ending.In short great game but freakingly stupid last boss."

Well worth the $1.50 (and still a deal at $3) if you like the old Final Fantasy games, Chrono Trigger, Breath of Fire, et cetera.

What I got in OH! RPG! is short term character development that keeps resetting. This is not at all what I hoped to get out of this game.It is not a badly made game, but I personally did not enjoy it, would not recommend it, and am requesting a refund.

Turn based JRPG. But in this version, the epic heroes have already fought the evil doom of the universe...and lost. The narrative flows between several scenes of those watching the heroes flee from the villian, leaving people behind to fend for themselves in a world that is shaking itself apart.Even though you don't use any character long enough to get really attached to them, the hook is definitely set as we watched the routed heroes at each turn. There's no shops, limited items, very little chance to grind. This game has more challenge then the average JRPG because resources are so limited and you must find the strategy that can work.All and all, a fun game. Kinda short, but well executed."

There's a setup with a bit of a payoff  per stage but overall, it's pretty simple.The combat and map layouts are where I find the most frustration with this game.

The heros failed to kill the final boss, and now he will slowly send the world into oblivion. But that's where the game begins. Play as npcs and even a monster as you complete side quests and get that one last thing done before armageddon, and call on the special skills of the heros if you get stuck. But don't rely on them too much, they might not make it before you die, or they might just decide not to help you. And every hero call reduces your score."
,Recommended,421810,20415307,"Posted: 8 January, 2016",all,anti-magic,"OH!RPG! is a puzzle RPG in a similar vein to that of 30 Second Hero, but instead of time management it is more about resource management and exploiting weaknesses.Each scenario has you in control of a unique, often weak character and it's your goal to get them through various enemy and boss encounters to reach their goal. Since they are not the heroes, you will need to use their special attacks and carefully balance how much MP and many recovery items you use over the course of the scenario so that you are capable of defeating the final boss.It's a fun little game but it does verge on frustrating when you have to lean on unreliable mechanics (e.g. evasion, confusion, critical attacks...) and every boss has the potential to just one shot you out of the blue. The dialogue also loves to break the 4th wall which gets a little grating but the story is a fun little spin on the formula and I quite liked the ending."
,Recommended,421810,20551421,"Posted: 15 January, 2016",all,Tulip O'Hare,"OH! RPG! is a short (if you gun for all the achievements, probably 10 hours) love letter to the classic SNES JRPGs. Stiff difficulty curve, and gimmicks to some of the bosses and puzzles, just like in the old days. Lots of bizarre, funny moments, with gobs of references and meta-humor. It's a very entertaining way to spend a few evenings, definitely worth the money.One warning: when you save, TREAT IT LIKE A CARTRIDGE. The game has some autosave capability, but it's way too easy to accidentally lose progress via same capability. Save early, save often, and never exit to title or close the game unless you've JUST manually saved. (If you're in the chapter select menu, go into a chapter and save.)"

Its actually one of the better games that I have playedperiod!The story and characters are quite compelling, although it is one of the sadest stories I have experienced in a short game like this. You'll have to play to find out why!The gameplay is almost the exact opposite of what I expected, but in the best way possible. It is not meant to be played quite like the typical RPG game. It has great replay value though, and is more than worth the price.My only complaint is that the ending really leaves you wanting more, and they never really explainjust what the hell is happening to the world!!!. I mean, if there isnevera sequel made to this game, or if they don't come out with a full feautre-length film about what happened""after""(after everything fades to white)... then I am going to come back and change the hell out of this review some day...But anyway, this is a highly recommended game, and a must have for any fan of compelling stories, off-beat characters, antiheroes, secret rooms, tons of weapon/armor upgrades, great music,ridiculousboss fights, jealousy, betrayal, pure lunacy... and things that will have a lasting effect on your soul.Buy This Game!!!People complaining about the last boss fight... it isNOTluck-based.

Never played an India-pixel-game with more aggressive old ladies!?And just.. Why the sheep?However; and this is a -either you like it, or you don't thing- you have to play each map some times to completely get every achievement and unlock every secret. First you look for the tiles, then you look for the mapping-errors, oh, and before that you probably beat the game to up your score..Well, it kept me irritated and amused for 19 hours, so I guess it's an achievement for such a small game :D.

I really liked the break-up between multiple characters as well as the point system.

It's definitely higher quality than some other ones out there and has some more work put into it. I like that you don't actually play as the heroes, but as a goblin betraying his overlord FOR the heroes. Still, I did question this game a bit.For starters, at some points of the game, the screen would freeze for a split second and jump forward a tile. Kinda messed with my eyes a bit.The battles are kind of a problem for me. They immediately throw you into strong battles with just yourself and have to rely on summon skills to fight back which requires you to wait a few turns while the enemies get to beat you to shreds. There was a point in the game where I was left alone and the game didn't give me enough potions so I ended up dying because your character doesn't have an attacking skill that can hurt more than one enemy.Again this game seems higher quality than the rest, but the actual gameplay is lacking.Thank god I didn't actually waste money on this game, got a coupon when I made a badge so.

When I first started this game I was pulled right in, however quickly you findout the Main Toons you never get to play are winey little brats complaining about why no one likes them because they failed to save the world.Pros--Graphics feel fresh with each area, nothing feels repetitive.Enjoy the upgrade system ( this is also a hugh CON below)The smimations & sounds during the battles were not that annoyingYou can change the keyboard interface making the game easy to controlCons-nearly 100% of the battles are 1v1 (and they drag on)you can ask a hero for help & he might not help (you spend 5 turns waiting to findout your going to be repeating the battle when the hero arrives and moks you and flees)The crafting system is great, but the componets can only be used for one toon, and you only have each toon for no more then one mission. So it is either upgrade the starting weapon or the only other weapon you will have with that toon. (just a real missed oppertunity here)The game offers little in the way of comfotable difficulty, your weapon is either severly under/ over leved. you start each area with a low level weapon that makes fighting nearly impossible. then you eventaullay find a weapon (the only other weapon) that is so overleved you a briskly defeating each enemy. there is nothing in between.Game has no map ( I would have been happy even with a mini map)The user level that you get for defeating each area is never explainedThere are side quest but you have no idea what they are. I Completed the first one, and I could not tell you what I did to do it.Just feels like a game that should be in early access that could still be fleshed out to be a really solid title.If you found it on mobile port for 99cents grab it, otherwise dont waste your time."

But, the story is just too rushed, everything's happening so sudden, and the characters as heroes are not even interested in anything - spoilers - like, really, anything, not even saying something more to their dead friend after they see his ghost, not even in the beginning after he is been blown to shreads. - end spoilers - What I also found really outrageous though, is the gameplay and specifically the battle system.It's very bad and awful as a playstyle, the heroes are kinda never in your party, you play as random commoners who just happen to be there in the worst time, whenever you try to call for help with the magic command, the heroes sometimes just don't do whatever you asked and being waiting for in the turns, instead, they sometimes do something else, entirely useless, or they won't bother to help at all. The game expects you to lose and try again and again to win the battle with your wits, pushing and frustrating you.I don't know what everyone is finding in this game, I've played it for a while believing the best things, I gave up after I played a little with the Old Lady. If you like something old school classic and want to spend money on it, try an F.F. series or something else, anything but this game."

It's a short game, and yet has several moments where it's way too cryptic. Not to mention that the game still has many bugs that are to be fixed (to be fair, of course, they ARE getting fixed).So why on Earth do I recommend this?The game's concept is fantastic. The story starts out with the heroes failing to save the world, and the story focuses on different characters as the world comes to an end. This is actually a really great idea. The gameplay itself, which (usually) focuses on one character at a time. Your given a system where armor and even potions get upgraded. And this works very well. There's five chunks in the game, each focusing on another character who crosses paths with the ""heroes"" that failed to save the world. There's enough differences between the characters and their story to keep things interesting (even the best way to upgrade your character will vary depending on who you are controlling), and each chunk is small and repeatable, so a mistake you make won't be plaguing you for the rest of the game (but there are rewards for doing well, so there's still incentive for upgrading well).This is not a great game, but it is a good game with great, interesting concepts.

If you're looking for a short RPG that does something a bit new, this isn't bad on a sale price.  I wish it had been longer, though, and less linear.  It was an interesting setting and I liked the idea of playing as NPCs, but the game is very short (4-6 hours if you do 100% completion) and quite linear.  For $1.99 though it's worth checking out if you're tired of the more traditional RPG fare.  I wish there were a ""Your Mileage May Vary"" category, but overall I do recommend it at least at a sale price."

For the 59 cents I paid during the discount, I will just take as appreciating the world. Watch out for bugs here, just throw the penny if you're in for what a dev can do in rpgmaker despite not letting the players see it's content due to bugs."

It honestly seemed like it was getting fixed, but the more I look at it, the more it seems like it was too broken to begin with.The cover art is a lightly edited RPG maker wallpaper, the assets are unoriginal, the only thing that can't be done in vanilla RPG maker is the moving enemy sprites, which can be remedied with a 10 second google search.It's supposed to be an RPG, right? As in Role Playing Game.Well, the game is a old school final fantasy ARPG, but instead of managing several units, you only have one. And a slow loading bad. And that one unit is too weak to kill most tough monsters, with a few exceptions. So you wait for the screen nuke bar to fill, use that, boom. Done. In the overworld, you go through puzzles that consist of... find an item, use that item to beat thing that was otherwise impossible, move on. Or push button. Or shove block.The Role Playing part isn't much better. You play as a few assorted NPC's, all of which are either default RPG Maker MV, or a custom character made with their sprite editor, but it doesn't really matter because they all have the same personality. Serious and grim. They have unique origin stories, but when it gets right down to it, it doesn't change the game.There's an illusion of a bigger world going on, but we never see that bigger world. We never see the bigger picture. I'd prefer to play the lead up to the broken world than this, because then I'd get to see this illusiary would as it pretends to be- an epic quest with multiple unique locations. And I had reccomended this on the grounds that it would be fixed. It has not been, I rescend my reccomendation.RPG maker is a tool for novice game designers to create something awesome. This... Is one good idea, turned into a dissappointing cash grab. I'm not going to give my seal of approval to this. It represents the Cube Worlds among us- An Indie game with a concept interesting enough to get people invested to buy it, then the creator leaves it an unfinished mess."

I dont want to provide spoilers, but can say the story is unique based on the characters you play as and how the game starts after the heroes fail to defeat the villain and how the story/map progresses throughout the chapters."
