The ones that annoyed me the most is no shortcut keys and  a weird in-combat zoom in that would sometimes hide enemy movement. Oh, my mistake, there is actually one shortcut key: Enter allows you to move the dialog along when you have no conversation options (which is about 95% of the time), but ONLY once you have clicked it first. I can't explain how annoying it is to press Enter and expect something to happen and then pressing it a few more times and then realizing ""Oh, yes. It only works once I've clicked it.""-As a Shadowrun title-Don't get me wrong, there are some good character and story bits in the game but it is a far cry from any of the other Shadowrun titles. There doesn't seem to by any character development.  For most of the time that I played (which I'll admit is not very long) I have not seen any conversation choices and the few I have encounter you can't really call 'choices' because there is only one.  Everything has been boiled down to the most basic it can get. Anything that isn't shooting has now been reduced to clicking an icon that you find from time to time on you missions and cyberdecks now function just like a gun. You literally can shoot someone for real damage outside of the matrix with your cyberdeck, which is good I guess because outside of cut scenes  the matrix doesn't seem to be part of the game.  And as far as I can tell, all summoned creatures (drones, spirits ect.) share cap within the party. You can only have 2 things summoned at any time.I must add that I'm not entirely sure about the matrix thing as I have not played a lot.-=Conclusion=-If you are looking  for a turn based RPG, it's quite lacking and I would recommend looking elsewhere. I suggest any other Shadowrun title on steam, Blaggards or Wasteland 2.If you are looking for a Shadowrun game, it's utterly atrocious. I recommend you send angry letters to the developers OR pretend this failure of a Shadowrun title doesn't exist and move on with your life.PS.There is one other thing about the game I feel I should mention. It's a shared world, meaning it's like an MMO. You get to see all the other players running around your game and you can go on mission with them and so on. Now this is not really for or against the game but nobody wants to see a shotgun wielding, lingerie wearing, transvestite troll named 'Pen!s'.Edit: Really, Steam? I can't even say P E N I S. What if it's his given name?"

It took a while for the finished product to come out but I am extremely pleased! Those who are famiiliar with the old school pen and paper version of this RPG will find this computer adaptation very enjoyable. The turn based tactical missions are challenging and fun. There is plenty of loot to be found during missions provided your team has the skills needed to grab it. The developers left room for add ons to the content. Im still working on the main story but having a blast and hoping more content continues to come out for this game!
,Not Recommended,421900,30325561,Posted: 4 March,all,ilsa,"Edit:  So I managed to get stable enough connectivity to make it through the first chapter and am now at ""Infected"".  I don't know about playing with other players, but the game is now basically infuratingly unbeatable solo.  Even with their so called ""Easy"" missions, their idea of a mission is making you face off against never ending swarms of *armies* of very-high level enemies that you have no chance of beating.  I'm giving up at this point because the frustration now completely overwhelms the enjoyment.Unlike all the other Shadowrun games, this one is dependent on an external server to play.  The publisher ATTEMPTED to create some kind of multiplayer co-op environment where people could run missions together.What they PRODUCED is a steaming pile of crap that has made the game virtually unplayable.  Whether they simply arn't running enough backend servers to support the number of players, or if there are other issues involved, the end result is that the game is infuratingly slow, occasionally taking as much as MINUTES between clicking an action and having that action actually happen.  As of right now, I can't even log in to play.The gameplay itself is extremely dumbed down, with not even close to the amount of character depth and configuration normally available.  While I can understand why this was done (in order to simplify and speed up interaction between multiple players), it is definitely a turn off for anyone who has enjoyed the skill flexibility in previous Shadowrun games."

Think Xcom: Enemy Unknown, but with Co-op and RPG elements.Standouts for me are the soundtrack, which is excellent, and the cosmetic customization.Updating after completing the main game, minus challenges:Things I liked-Soundtrackcostmetic customization (so I can change my look without altering effectiveness)simple but effective controls and UIan interesting story (coming from a newcomer to Shadowrun in general)Things I didn't like-Limited class abilitieslimited gearrecycled maps and missions (understandable for side quests)The majority of the voice acting, which is oddly only present for about 1/5 of the conversations in the game.Overall, this game is excellent for the money (especially on sale) and very impressive considering the size of the team behind it. I've dumped a couple dozen hours into it and definitely have gotten my money's worth and then some. My largest complaint would be the way gear unlocks are staggared. Toward the middle of the third act, you unlock access to a myriad of new gear, but after going 15 or so missions since the last unlocks, you'll probably have enough cash to just pick up the best items for your build. It's not like it's a ""this thing has better stats in these categories and this thing has better other categories,"" as much as this is better than that. This takes a relatively large selection and narrows it down to a single choice (maybe two), imposing an artificial limit to your decision.There are a couple ""boss encounters"" in the game, but only the final Boston Lockdown story mission stands out as a ""real"" boss. The difficulty curve up to that point was pretty static: ♥♥♥♥ up a movement early in a mission and you MIGHT end up taking a couple extra hits. The final Boston Lockdown mission, the curve jumps up 3-4 notches. It took my buddy and I (who usually steamroll stuff like this) a couple tries to work out mechanics and strategy. Definitely a standout moment in the campaign and left us wishing there had been more of that than recycled maps, but again with such a small dev team, I understand why.A note for the future: If there was weapon customization, I think I'd have creamed my jeans."

I have played everything Shadowrun, including pen and paper. I don't know that I like the RPG mechanics of this as much as the Harebrained Schemes games but I love the action and shorter missions. The other games are written great but sometimes I wish there was a little less of it. Sometimes I just want to go on a run and shoot a bunch of corporate security without reading ten pages of exposition and character interaction."

It likes the XCOM more than the Shadowrun.No Heal, No trap spell, No overwatch, No Sniper, 1 attack per turn, No Cyberspace, ...Attacks are seperated to 3 types; Physical, Magic, and Tech.If you play it without Shadowrun title, you may enjoy it."

Not because of a bad story, or poor graphics, or even because it doesnt capture the Shadowrun feel. It has no trouble in any of the above areas. The reasons it gets a thumbs down: 1) Solo playability after the story. I know ""mmo title"" but I do not play games to socialize, I play MMO type games because of availability of larger selections of content that I can play alone. I do not mind helping someone who is stuck on something or is in need of help, but by and large I prefer the solo experience. Solo ends with the story so there is zero replayability for me. 2) Connectivity issues are a going concern with this title at the moment. I had a day where I was dropped from the server AT LEAST 6 times mid mission. Now, the game doesnt kill your character when the mission drops it just ends the mission. The problem here is repeating the same few minutes of a mission until the server stabalizes enough for you to actually enjoy the game. The most recent patch did very little to address this issue as it claimed to have done. 3) Like EVERY game released now days it is an incomplete title. I truly miss the days where you would receive a game (yes even an mmo) that was a completed game. Now it seems we are relegated to basic game frameworks with ""pay as you play"" patches, downloads, and endless unwanted updates. JUST PRODUCE A FINISHED GAME. If it needs a patch to resolve a bug or two after that, fine patch it but dont disseminate drips and drabs of a whole game when that is NOT what I've payed for. Anyway great gameplay, good story, good graphics; zero replayability."

Pick it up on sale, and only if you have played Dragonfall and the other titles, and feel like you just want more, and/or have a few friends that you really want to go shadowrunning with.It is important to note that the 'Director's Cut' is actually the original game plus the first DLC in one convenient package.The story is linear, the mechanics are oversimplified, and the customization has a few wonky quirks.  Still, you *know* you want to see how Boston is holding up in 2072.  The answer is, holy Landsdowne street kid,  Fenway is still standing!If you are a New Englander, the accents are done well enough, but the pacing will make you feel like you are suffering kids reading paragraphs aloud in 4th grade all over again.  Real southies running shadows would be talking about the Sox at least twice as fast, and with more cussing. There are enough fun culture references to crack a smile though.Overall, the game plays the way you would expect from user generated content - not a published, full price release title.  I do enjoy user generated missions and campaigns, so it's not a coffin nail.  The developers are still updating the game, so it may pay to keep an eye on it too.The big big redeeming cookie is multiplayer turn based strategy, so hopefully your significant other is cool rolling a decker to debuff your targets, or vice versa.You will want to play this if you have already played the other Shadowrun titles and want another good story, or you have some runner friends you trust enough to watch your back, or you have some *ahem* fond memories of adventures in the combat zone...."

The missions are dull, the story is poorly written, the voice-acting is spotty where it exists at all, and the mechanics are a joke.  Like with the XBOX game a decade ago, this is a slapdash money grab which adbducted the Shadowrun name and setting and is now wearing a suit made from its skin."

If taking on the world with friends is your goal, then you'll happily find captivating turn-based combat with cooperative multiplayer in the excellent cyberpunk+fantasy world of Shadowrun.It delivers exactly what it promises, and comes from a developer that's repeatedly shown that they respect their community and know a lot about what makes a turn-based cooperative game work!"
76561198069898970,Recommended,421900,24308625,"Posted: 13 July, 2016",all,divinevisitor,"Everyone compared this game to HBS' Shadowrun Returns game when it was released for it's similar turn-based stratagy combat. I'm sure the devs knew it would and I'm going to be pointing some of these similarities out the least I can for this review. I picked this up during the steam summer sale so getting it at a discount might be swaying my opinion yet when I think about the content I've played through so far(30 hours) the original $30 price doesn't seem too much. And there IS alot of content, or should I say missions. I don't normaly play MMO's but when I do they seem like all they are is just a bunch of fluff and filler to spend your time. Go here and collect X 20 times over. Boston Lockdown has very little filler and the exellent story keeps you going. This game really draws you in and makes you FEEL like a runner alot more than HBS' Shadowrun. This Shadowrun lets you taylor your character from look to cloths to archtype. Your character is yours, not some premade runner made by the devs or someone from the workshop community. When you enter the HUB you can interract with other runners(players) and go on combat missions with them. Combat is what you would expect with a turn-based stratagy game like HBS' Shadowrun or (more so) XCOM enemy within. I prefer this game over HBS' Shadowrun for acouple reasons. You can turn the camera to get a better view of the battle, which leads to more strategic positioning than HBS' Shadowrun. The ability to mold your character more freely also leads to more options on how you approach battles. The battles also seem to provide more of a challenge than HBS' Shadowrun but thats more of a skill thing from player to player. Other reviews have complained about the voice acting. I can understand why they would complain but for one this is not a AAA game so how can expect that much, second I'm one who enjoys some cheese now and then, watching Kevin Sorbos' Hurcules after a night of drinking is just good times man good times. It really is disappionting some people would let that get in the way of this exceptional story. This game is the closest thing to Shadowrun tabletop in a video game and I applaud Cliffhanger Games for thier effort. User generated maps is the best way to keep this game going and I so hope it keeps going, it's extremly addictive. If you like Shadowrun or just turn-based stratagy in general try this game!"

But my happiness is short-lived. The devs of this game have great concept and ample time but I am very sorry to say the implementation is pretty mediocre.Cons:1) Combat encounters is one-dimensional and boring2) Gun and gear avilability is short3) Weird disconnection error while having constant network connectivity4) Very small amount of RPG Elements5) No conversation options6) Skill/class system is not coherent.Pros:1) Good Concept2) Good Story3) Customization Options4) Good Visuals for Gear and GunsI plead to the devs please enhance and improve this game to reach its true potential if you can and please make sure there is no server issues. This is a game you did not love but still cannot put down.

The back-story profile you can pick for your character reads like it was thrown together quickly.  The summoning/spell speciailization feels sloppy.  There doesn't seem to be a good back-story like dragonfall.

Go figure, someone born in the 80's who is only just now being introduced to SR. Anyway, here goes.I don't know if it's just the fact I don't care enough about Voice Acting to be hypercritical about it in this game like some of the reviews I have read, or if I just haven't found any fault in it as of yet. Still playing the game, so I'll have to keep listening. Although, for me, the only thing Voice Acting is good for is to make it so I don't have to read the text myself.As far as the Skill system is concerned, I like the utter freedom you get when playing the Pen and Paper system, and yes the SR: Returns Skill system gives you a bit more freedom than the system present in this title, but I like the choices you have to make. It forces you to build a cohesive character rather than one that can be all things to all people. Why am I going to be this physical powerhouse that can at the same time finesse his way through the entire game. In a single player game, it's fine to max out everything. In a multiplayer game, you have other players to fill in the holes left by our character concept.As for the gameplay, it plays almost identically to SR: Returns. You have your allotted movement and actions. The only difference being you could perform an aggressive action and still move after in SR: Returns. In this you have to do your moving before any aggresive actions. So far, I am pretty enamored of the mechanics. I haven't come across the hazards others talked about as of yet.So far, I am throroughly enjoying this game."

This makes the movements of the characters jumppy.The enemy turn starts before your last runner finishes movement if they appear on that turn.There's no real storyline lays like the other shadowrun games.Some of the npcs in town are highlighted with orange names, but gives nothing in chatting. Their name remains orange even when the only option is ""Good Bye"" in chat.The game seems unable to be launched without server connection. I got this game several months earlier, but couldn't connect the server until now.

It has interesting character development, quite fluid and playable combat system, great theme. Sadly, for me its multiplayer system is completely off-putting. Everytime after a run, I go back to the base and my immersion is completely broken by random people running through my char and everywhere around the screen.If I knew beforehand that this is basically mmo, I would not buy it, as it really destroyes any sense of accomplishment from single player campaign. The game is advertised as indie strategy rpg, as xcom with magic. In fact it is tactical mmorpg. If it were clearly described as mmo, I would recommend it as the gameplay is sound, however as a single player title I cannot do so.If you want good single player RPG go for one of the Harebrained's titles. Or Witcher, or something, but beware - this certainly is not a single player title."
