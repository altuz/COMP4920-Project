The artwork style and magic reminds me very much of the mystery and imagination of Adventure Time, whilst still being incredibly uniqe and creating its own vibe and memorable characters.The gameplay itself is filled with creative ideas that are challenging, enjoyable and feel satisfying to beat. I definitely reccomend this game to anyone wanting an enjoyable timewaster. Being on a laptop and keyboard, I personally had no problem with the controls whatsoever, though they take a bit of practice to really get the hang of!"

It does have a singleplayer campaign if you want to play alone (haven't played it yet), but I think that the real worth is in bringing some friends over and having a great time. If that's what you wanna do, this game is for you."

76561198173899526,Recommended,422110,33857086,Posted: 28 July,all,Groove Wizard,"Wand Wars is a really polished game, and probably the best party-game I've ever played.While there's a clear Lethal League feel to it, it's clearly more accessible, because the game mechanics are so simple. The problem with Lethal League is that even though it's an excellent game, it has that fighting game aspect that makes it very complex. You've got to learn safe zones, angles of shooting, bunts, with or without jumps, special moves, etc... and consequently, when you hit 50 hours of playtime, your friends will be no match for you anymore.That's why Wand Wars is epic to play on a couch. The soundtrack and art are really cool too, and the storyline is delightfully quirky. It really is a shame to me that this game lacks visibility so much.Go get it guys. And if you don't have friends to play with, it's time to go get some too !"

Then I remembered how much I loved Lethal League for the fun, fast paced little gem it was and said ""♥♥♥♥ it"" and bought this game for 12 bucks. Instantly, I fell in love and realized that this game brings more complexity and flair to that Lethal League niche. The game is fast and blood pumping, the controls are responsive to match, the soundtrack slaps, and the character sprites are amazing. Granted, this game ramps up the difficulty pretty high at times, almost to the point where you'll want to put your fist through your computer screen, but its also super rewarding when you reach a personal goal or checkmark in the story. Of course, this game could benefit from online play, but the ""Endless Tirals"" mode gives a LOT of life and replayability to this game. Support the Devs. Pray for online. Give this game a shot. It's probably one of the best ways you can spend 12 doll-hairs on the internet."

There are challenging and very fun local multiplayer modes to try and play, magics to dominate and characters to unlock.

,Recommended,422110,25759715,"Posted: 28 September, 2016",all,Witch Cat,"BUY👏THIS👏GAME👏NOW👏FEMALE DOG👏Ok, but in all seriousness, Wand Wars, despite its corny name, is one of the best games I have ever purchased on Steam. It is the most fast paced, fun, heart racing, colourful, and unique game I have encountered so far. There is no way I'll ever be able to do this game justice with just one simple review, but I'll try anyway! (Warning: I wrote this review in the span of like 10 minutes, so forgive me if this is a little short. Also, English isn't my first language so feel free to point out any mistakes I made!)The Good:The SpritesThe pixel art in this game has to be one of the best I've ever seen, the art style really helps it stand out among other pixel art retro games with their, unfortunately, samey designs. Everything on screen is colourful and clear, it is obvious that a lot of love and attention to detail went into this game. I still find myself ogling at the wonderful art in between matches or games.The MusicA fast paced game obviously needs some fast paced music, and honestly, the soundtrack, while on the short side, doesn't disappoint. It is extremely catchy, well-made, flows wonderfully, fits the feel of the game, and it is just amazing. I even got the soundtrack, which I never do with any game, and I still frequently listen to it. It is just the thing to make someone really hyped for what's coming. However, some people may not like the rather short soundtrack, but every song is varied enough to not make you feel as if you're listening to the same song over and over again.The GameplayI'll admit, at first glance, I thought this was just an over-glorified Pong game with wizards instead of whatever those white lines were supposed to be in Pong. I could not have been more wrong. While it does share some elements with Pong (and by some I mean just one), it still manages to stand on its own as a game. The power-ups, characters, challenges, game modes, all that good stuff really helps to keep this game fresh and adds a lot of replayability. I honestly see myself years in the future still starting up this game to beat someone's♥♥♥♥♥atQuittichWand Wars. The game is also very faced paced but balanced. Anyone from the most casual to hard-core gamer can sit down together and have a fair 1v1 match. Or 1v1v1v1, or 3v1, or 2v2, and you get the idea. In short, there is a lot of poopy to do in this game, and I'm enjoying every second of it. No matter how many matches I play, I can never get bored of it.The ControlsWhile this may seem like a silly thing to comment on, you will not believe how many of these fast paced games I've played that have the most horrendous and awkward controls. Thankfully, Wand Wars doesn't fall into this trap. The controls in this game are very smooth, tight and responsive. Your fingers flow naturally over the keys and you're never let wondering what button does what. And it's even better when using a controller! To be honest with you, I wouldadoreit if I was able to change the controls. But that's more of a nitpick than actual criticism. If the Devs decide to let you tweak your controls, then yay for me! And if they don't, then eh, what can you do? The controls are still tight and responsive nonetheless.The Local MultiplayerAll I have to say about this is, YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS. FINALLY, A GAME WITH PROPER LOCAL MULTIPLAYER. HAVE I DIED AND WENT TO HEAVEN? THIS. IS. SO. YES. Just yes, you have no idea how it fun it is to be able to sit on a couch and duke it out with friends. While yah, lobby making is a thing in a lot of games. Lobbies will NEVER match the amount of fun and the intimacy one experiences when you sit down with all your friends together and play rather than playing on separate consoles/PCs.Now, we all know no game is perfect, and Wand Wars has a few problems it does need to sort out. As much as it pains me to be critical about this game, I really want this to be a fair review.The Bad:The Obvious ProblemLet's address the elephant in the room. There is no online play. Yah, that's right, no online matchmaking, no online tournaments, none of that. All local multiplayer. WAIT DON'T LEAVE YET! Trust me, the Devs KNOW that people want online play, and the Devs want to implement it into their game! Trust me, I talked to them. They REALLY would love it if they were able to bring all of y'all online play, but they can't do it right now. For one reason or the other, the Devs currently cannot add that feature into their game, but you and I know, they really want to. And maybe they will! We are just going to have to be patient. And remember, Wand Wars is Moon Radish's first game, and they are an EXTREMELY small team. I would appreciate it if you didn't constantly pester them with questions all the time, feel free to respectable ask about something that concerns you, but remember these are very busy people. They just realised a HUGE update, and they are very hardworking, you will get your online play, don't worry. But just not now.The UnfairnessI get it, these fast paced games have to be difficult and to present a challenge if they don't want to get boring fast. However, at the time that I am typing this out, the game is very unfair. The campaign can get near impossible at times, and it really could use a little tweaking. With enemies that catch the spell almost a 100% of the time, pin-point accurate enemies, hordes of the enemy teams constantly volleying the ball to the point where it's impossible to catch it. The whole game suffers from this, but the newest game mode, The Trails, suffers the most from this huge problem.Everything and everyone you constantly fight in The Trails are part of the same team, the opposing team constantly volleyed the ball to the point where it goes supernova without you touching it once, the AI is way too smart at countering and killing the enemy (Hell, some can predict where you're going to spawn after dying), the Knights always and only targeting the enemy. The whole thing is a cluster fook and soon it'll be impossible to see your own character as the screen fills up with the red sprites of the enemy team. Don't get me wrong, the game mode is extremely fun and creative, don't let my harsh words stop you from buying this game. I am being very hyperbolic here. But still, the game could use a bit of tweaking and maybe starting with The Trails first would be the best option.Perhaps make some trails a free-for-all, or always have a very small chance of a friendly wizard spawning to help you, or have the Knights and other random spellcasters (whose names I forgot) pick no teams and go after everybody. When most people can't get past the 7th trail, it's time for some tweaking.A few closing words. if any of you really want to help the Devs to make their first game a success, then I recommend you go out and spread the word about this. DO IT. The Devs had an extremely unfair start, with their game realising at midnight, the ""Add to Cart"" button bugging out, and having their game pushed down the new realises list by 50 open-world, survival, zombie crafting games. The Devs had an extremely rocky start and deserve all the help they can get. Please, do not let this well-crafting game be doomed to be forgotten. The Devs put ALOT of heart, hard work, and effort into this beautifully crafted game. And besides, who wouldn't want to turn their friends into chickens?"

BUT NO!!! instead you can only move with arrow keys, catch is C!, hex arrows are V! aim is same buttons as movement and spell gem is X! it is redulously uncomfortable. And you can't change them.Also it is a little unresponceive at times and it might just my device but it works fine on any other game so...And to add to that the AI can catch everything sweat free first time; ON THE LOWEST DIFFICULTY.There is a custom gamemode thing but it's just 'you all start with these items'. So if you don't like an item tough. And there are other gamemodes in the story and you might unlock them eventually but i don't think i'll play long enough to find out.1 more thing is the trails mode are a little too hard without 2 players and this is ultimatly true with the mad knights.All in all I want my money back and i feel as if my laptop does too with the amount of frustraition this has caused me and it brings a literal tear to my eye that this game could have been so much more but they screwed so much."
