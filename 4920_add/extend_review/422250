76561198042646749,Not Recommended,422250,29259342,Posted: 14 January,all,kris.aalst,"Shiplordis an arcade game. You control a space ship and need to collect as many white orbs as you can before the timer runs out. Meanwhile, a bunch of asteroids are thrown your way. To help you collect orbs while dodging the asteroids, your ship has three 'skills' (special functions). You can:raise a shield that protects you from the asteroids and even destroys them on contactslow down time for a few secondspull all the orbs on the screen towards your ship and collect them instantlyAt the end of each level you completed successfully, which means you collected a minimum amount of orbs before time ran out and managed to keep your ship in one piece, you get a score. A better score means more points to spend in a 'skill tree'. Here you can increase the duration of your ship's special functions and reduce their cooldown time. Every time you get a very good score, you unlock a new type of space ship that you can fly. Better ships reduce the cooldown time of your ships special functions a bit.Every 5 levels, you get served a 'boss level'. In those levels you're up against a bigger space ship that shoots wave after wave of bullets you need to dodge. If you manage to keep your ship in one piece until the timer runs out, the bigger ship is destroyed and you win.Shiplordis a very basic game that will only entertain for an hour. You may play it for two hours to get most of the Steam Achievements. If you're a completionist and want to unlock all the ships and such (maybe to get the Steam Achievement for that), it may take you three or four hours, depending on your accuracy and luck.It's not a bad game per se but there isn't much toShiplordand there are thousands of games on Steam, so I can't recommend it. This is a game that would get a 5 out of 10 rating in my book and this is one of those times where I'd take the easy way out and not click 'yes' or 'no' in reply to the question ""Do you recommend this game?"", if that were an option."

(more ships, levels and at least a few unique elements)ShipLord would never be a huge game with tons of followers but for what it's worth they should have added more effort into it.  The game is too repetitive and there isn't much depth which makes it a poor game. There are a few other cheap games like this on steam that are much better.Pass on this one and play something else."
,Not Recommended,422250,29976445,Posted: 16 February,all,coolRONz,"Calling it a bullet hell is not tue, its more of a lame flight sim of sorts.. All you really do is fly around picking up and dodging things. Its pretty bad, but honestly I don't feel ripped of for 50 cents either.. At first I was like where is the fire button on my controller? Then I figured out there is no fire button... LOL Achievements and trading cards are easy and a plus though."
76561197991819924,Not Recommended,422250,21624277,"Posted: 4 March, 2016",all,Sylian,"This is a short game that you can easily beat in a few hours. If you're going for Diamond on every level you'll be in for some ride, though... A ride that's not really worth it. The boss fights (on Diamond) are frustratingly hard, and not for the right reasons. In order to win, you need to combine skilled gameplay (good) with memorization (not that great) and some luck (bad). This would not have been so bad if the controls were better, but they are not suited for precise maneuvering. Many good bullet hell games will let you slow down your movement by holding a button, but ShipLord doesn't let you to that, which means that you'll crash into projectiles that should've been easy to dodge.A lot of the time I felt like I died not because of error I made but because of flaws in the game. Sometimes astroid formations are nearly impossible to dodge, and sometimes astroids spawn just as you pick up a point at the edge of the screen. Oh, and points sometimes spawn inside of astroids, making them hard to spot until it's too late. If you're unlucky they will spawn at the opposite side of the screen, thus not giving you enough time to pick them up unless you use ""Energy Collector"".The graphics, story, and voice acting are all below average, and there are a few grammar and spelling mistakes in the game. The game would've been better if it were in 2D and it would've been better without any story or voice acting, though that's a minor complaint.I give this game a 6 or a 7 out of 10. It is not entirely without merit, but there are so many better games out there, and unless you really like the genre I recommend you skip it. I had some fun with it, despite how frustrating it could be at times. It might be worth picking up on a game, but it's a very unpolished game that has a lot of flaws."

Imagine asteroids or gradius without the ability to fire, its beyond boring its beyond annoying and boarders on the completly stupid. Would have been fairly cool if you could shoot in some way. I think it should be catagorized differently, I think it should explicitly say that in the description. Any race that creates a ship for deep space tavel that is aware there are threats that will try and kill you and doesnt put some kind of offensive weaponry on its ships is more than likely going to be conqured by a race of aliens who only have nails in boards I.E the simpsons when all the guns are destroyed. 2/10"
,Not Recommended,422250,29955681,Posted: 15 February,all,Derpy -hnd-,"There are two major setbacks for me.1. The bosses lack a description on what each difficulty does, such as adding more projectiles and what not.2. The final boss appears to have a bug in which projectiles will randomly spawn around you, not from the boss. This makes the last level very annoying to finish and you have to be lucky that these random projectiles don't spawn and when they do, you are quick enough to get rid of it.Some tips:-Despite having audio at 0, some noises will still be played such as the explosion of your ship and voices of bosses.-Upon reaching 110 quasars for diamond, no more have to be obtained. Just survive!-Each upgrade goes up to 15 levels. You will be able to max all skills (although to be able to you would need to defeat the final boss on diamond for the last 6 points)-Try to use the quasar collecting ability when 3 quasars are on your screen. That's the max I was able to get.A cheap game good for people wanting to up their game count or for those who want fairly easy (I use this losely) achievements. I don't recommend this game for those who tend to get upset easily at ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t."

Instructions are not clear how to get different ship and 1st level boss is extremely difficult even on easiest level.   Got tired of trying to get past and shelved the game.

It surely is challenging, but gets pretty boring after a while.Some shoting would have been nice."
