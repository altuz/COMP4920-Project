76561198093265851,Not Recommended,422420,20939545,"Posted: 3 February, 2016",all,71,"As someone who doesn't particularly care about the Godus-related drama, I came at this simply hoping to see whether Godus Wars could be considered worth its asking price ($15 USD).My feeling from playing through the first 10 battles is that it isn't. There doesn't seem to be much to do beyond:1) Level the ground around your starting village.2) Cast the Build/Upgrade Citadel power as Belief permits.3) Throw armies at the AI's Citadel until razed.4) Dance around the Belief silo for 30 seconds.5) Repeatad nauseam.Perhaps there's more to it if you progress even further on, but the poor path-finding makes control cumbersome and the game was starting to have some serious frame rate issues toward the end of my playtime. Eventually culminating in the game completely freezing.EDIT: So apparently, after you defeat the first island (circa 20 battles), the game throws up a $5 USD paywall to unlock the next island.EDIT 2: Within a day of launch, the 2nd island is now free to unlock for everyone. However, it's still the case that future islands may require additional purchase to unlock, so be wary of that.EDIT 3: Having now played through the 2nd (and currently last) island, I can now say with certainty that steps 1 to 5 generally hold true throughout the entire game. Although the trebuchets do add a nice bit of wanton destruction to the mid-/late-game, they are rather easy toexploit.-------If you have $15 USD to buy a game on steam, there are much better games to be found elsewhere."

BUT as bonus difficulty you have to meet todays standards for RTSs, because now you want to be an RTS also.Despite being in development for a very long time now, the game is very light contentwise. It's a bit of a backtrack to the first version of Godus, although you have to do less now.You are there to level the ground, so that your people (which you can't control)can build their houses on plots(which appear automatically)to generate belief (which now gets collected automatically, one of the few positive aspects).When you have enough belief, you build a fort (out of your houses that merge together automatically to a chunk with battlements) where you can recruit soldiers.These soldiers are somewhat controllable, although their pathfinding is terrible and the mouse response is too, and you send them to conquer and destroy the enemy village.Also the animations are clunky and ugly, the collision detection doesn't work that great resulting in corpses hovering above ground and blood splatters spread widely although the corpse is already gone.That's it for the beginning, so at the moment the game is neither fish nor meat, as RTS it falls flat on its face because there are way better ones out there, and the god game aspect is mainly moving around dirt to make way for plots, not very interesting either.VERDICT:I gave the first Godus the benefit of the doubt, rating it positive, because it showed promise and I changed my rating to negative when the support ceased and the game died.This time I will do it the other way round, so it gets a negative rating from the start (because it absolutely deserves this), BUT this version of Godus also shows promise, so if it gets way better and deeper than it is now, the rating might also change. As for now, NOT RECOMMENDED.(PS: And dear developers, get rid of that cheap mobil-ish feel of the game, as long as your plan isn't to use PC gamers as beta testers for mobile AGAIN, this won't do you any good.)"

Since he is the one who did Black and White, he's getting a LOT of responses.Next, development is slow, and information is conflicting. Supporters get irritated. Molyneux keeps promising cool features, but at the same time the game is weirdly defective, and features are few.Supported get annoyed. Molyneux responds by making it a pay-to-win card game. Next, he removes the in-game store. For a bit.Supporters get angry. He says it's not pay-to-win, but keeps adding pay-to-win features. Finally, he admits it's pay-to-win, and moves over to a full cardgame.Supporters get angrier. Molyneux responds by completing a quick Android cash-cow, based on Godus, and development of the actual game stops for a bit. Months later, he sacks his entire team, but ""development is ongoing!"".Finally, he renames the game, which removes all previous reviews. He did add one thing he promised years ago; combat. However, it's available as a card-based mini-game. The original game is virtually unchanged.It would appear Molyneux was either out for a quick cashgrab. And he failed miserably."

,Not Recommended,422420,20943261,"Posted: 3 February, 2016",all,Frijoles,"You know, I actually didn't mind Godus. Sure, the clicking was annoying, but I did spend a fair amount of time in there building things up and exploring the lands. It wasn't terrible. But this? I don't even know what to make of it. There's only one reason I can think of as to why a company would release a game in this state, and that's money. They should simply call it, ""Godus - We Need Money"". Where to begin? I'm going to do my review backwards from what I usually do.The UglyWhy, in all the holy lands of Godus, does this application launch a second full screen application when I try to battle? I can't even fathom how this works. Are they using some sort of battle engine in Godus that they didn't want to port over to Godus Wars? What happens if I uninstall Godus (I may try this)? I'm completely flabbergasted on this. I wanted to ask in the forum, or maybe it's in the FAQ, but...The BadThe forums are currently locked. Any time a company locks the forum and allows no discussion, right away you know it's to avoid negative threads. And this game, AS IS, will only be negative threads. They knew this was a pile of ... going in to it, yet they pushed it out anyway. Was there no way to simply wait a few weeks until the engine could be fleshed out? They put up absolute garbage and praised it, despite it being several orders of magnitude worse than Godus.The battles themselves, when they work, are fairly simple. This (I hope) changes later on, but I haven't gotten very far yet because the game keeps crashing. Perhaps it's releated to it trying to run another process and getting confused somewhere inbetween. The few times it has worked, I had to manually select the second window it opens.One of the major complaints in Godus was all the clicking. The clicking is still in this game, but luckily it appears you don't HAVE to do it. It feels more like a bonus click now. The game generates points on its own, but you can still click the rocks and trees to get additional points. I put this in the bad section because I fear it's going to feel like I still have to click all those rocks if I want to stay ahead.Graphics-wise, the cards it shows me are blurry if I click on them. They don't appear to be very high resolution (I was running on 1920x1200). The rest of the engine in the battles looked fine since it was the Godus style, but the other windows that were tacked on for this just don't have a crisp look to them. I understand this is EA (very very early EA I hope), so maybe they can be bothered to drop a slighly higher resolution image in sometime during the EA period.The starting God Powers, sculpting land, seems a bit pointless so far. I can't destroy the land under my enemies and destroy their village. I hope there's more later on (at this point I wouldn't put it past them to not have other powers), but I certainly don't feel very powerful here. Esentially the first few maps are:  Click this building, build a unit, send them to the enemy, go to next map. If your map is going to last 30 seconds, why bother? Make it a bigger map. Especially if you're going to screw around with my resolution and desktop switching from application to application.The GoodLike Hearthstone, this game has a spinner at the start. Unlike Hearthstone, this one actually matters. It changes the battle from making items/cards cost more to giving you bonuses or debuffs. I like the random nature of this, and if it works right, it would add a lot of replayability.... boy, not much else to say that's good. I rarely do reviews. Godus Wars is clearly a cash grab disguised as.. I don't know what. If you still have Godus in your library, stick with that. It at least has a calming effect, unlike this that just causes anger."

It also has paywalls and DLC that are a complete betrayal to people who bought GODUS on Early Access and backed in on Kickstarter.This game wants to be an RTS but its scope and ambition is severly limited. It is not particularly good at what it does and brings nothing new to the genre. Lacking even the most basic resource system, like its parent winning is limited to how much clicking you can do.Why are there two windows for this game? Makes no sense. Why is the screen grab button the same as the troop order button? Who does these things?If you dont believe me read here:http://kotaku.com/peter-molyneux-releases-another-godus-game-1756857351The developers of this game absolutely can not be trusted and you should avoid this and any other title like the plague. If you think its worth giving a go because as an early access game it will get better, you need to read more about 22Cans. This very limited and flawed reboot of GODUS comes after a 12month period in which no major content updates were made to GODUS. The release of this game is the first meaningful communication from 22Cans in five months. As a potential customer you need to know they do not serve their community, they serve their wallets."

Instead this is just more highly questionable behaviour used to distort and twist things in a long history of shady practises from this company.Don't be fooled into thinking this is a positive step or signs of life.

It's something 22Cans have had a small sub-team throw together in Unity during the year or more of Godus development being dead and buried to try and bury Godus and the crap they pulled."

I would love to talk about the gameplay, I however, Can't.Upon entering my first battle, the game decided to crash (and then proceeded to take my whole system down with it).Also, weirdly, why why why in a million years was it a good idea to effectively have a game, within a game (two windows?) - it would seem to choose your battle, cards, god etc in one window, and then the battle opens in another window, keeping the last window open (and it didn't like my dual screens at this point) - who thought this was a good idea? I mean, really?EDIT: Managed to start playing, first thing I noticed was the looping battle track of 3 seconds...Then got stuck on the Victory screen! Literally cannot get off the victory screen -.-Ok, so, now back in the game, 3rd time's the charm right?!Had to do the same battle again - fine, it was quick - oh... oh.... How can a single set of archer units get split up due to pathing problems on the simplest of maps? - half my squad went where I told them,  the other half decided to go the wrong way around the castle, got stuck, went back again, then teleported to the main group...Hey! Atleast the victory screen worked this time!Next battle... oh dear, we need to clear land for this one. (I should note it is VERY much more suited for mobile - but that won't come as a suprise to anyone)One thing is for sure, the sound design in this is painful. I cannot listen to a single second more - it will drive you insane in a short period of time.So yeh, had to write this, it's simply GODawful.GODawful."

This was supposed to be one game; people dropped money on his promise to reboot Populus. And now I am so suspicious of early-access games; Godus has decimated my desire to help indie companies in fear that it will be their ""retirement"" game. The game they never finish, just collect enough money so they can go pension somewhere. The game's tagline is completely misleading.

First this was a horrible attempt to side step all the negative reviews for the original Godus by renaming the game to Godus Wars.  Even ignoring the train wreck from the first attempts at a free2play mobile game, this new game is just as bad but with new bugs and tech problems.  The game launches two windows, a strategic mode window with the world map and another that runs for the battles.  This second window is almost never in focus or even on fully on screen.  Furthermore, you can't fullscreen the second new window and end up unable to read parts that windows task bar overlaps.  Unity selection is flaky and often times ends up making you deform the terrain instead.There are new card and map mode changes to Godus Wars that make it feel even more like a free flash game.  Add to that when it was released they had paywalls for DLC content for a $20 unfinished game.  It really tells you what kind of company/developers they are at heart.

I couldn't get past the first 5 minutes without hating myself for wasting my money.First of all, if you're going to label this as a seperate game, WHY THE HELL put a choice between Godus and Godus Wars on the opening screen? IF I WANTED TO PLAY GODUS, I WILL HAVE CHOSEN IT IN MY STEAM LIBRARY. Sorry for the use of all caps but that was a point I wanted to make clear, and absolutely clear.When I get in the game, I was asked to pick a God, so I did. Poof. Game died. Restart:  I'm greeted with a globe and images of a God in red and my God in blue. When I spin the globe for some reason, little sprites of blue followers fly out for some reason (like you do, I nearly fell off of our planet the other day) and I don't mean 3 dimensional little people, but crappy 2D sprites, flying off in a 3D view, that you can view from any angle, and, as you can imagine, if you look down the middle then fortunately these thingies go. So after I spend a good minute wondering wth that globe thing is for I realise the glowing red continent is what the game wants me to go on, so I click it and click ""Next"".So I'm in. Or am I? It seems I'm in an overview of this continent, with my people, or whatever you can call them, at one side of the continent and the enemy at the other. Or, I assume they are. I mean with this game, who knows. I am then directed to send my people to some innocent people who are next to mine. So, I go to battle with them. WHAT'S THIS? I'M IN GODUS?? Oh yes, apparently they couldn't be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to package the Godus code and stuff into a different application so they just went and fudged it and linked it to Godus. Because I don't have enough applications open. So, I play along, and I have a village and the other village, the enemy village, is on the other side, simple. So I have to summon my archers through the ""Citadel"" and the send them to the village. I do so, and my archers are sent to massacre the innocent people of this island. They do so, and a house topple over on to it's side. But, guess what. When it toppled over, the underside of the adobe has a transparent texture, for christ sake.To finalise, do not buy. DO NOT BUY.

I even updated it several times so it reflects the latest changes to the game. But in the end, my opinion never changed: Godus was an epic failure. For Godus Wars I don't intend on investing a similar amount of time, it's just not worth it.Just as the original game Godus Wars has some potential, but, in it's current state, is not worth the asking price. The sculpting mechanics are still not precise enough and the tacked on RTS elements are very basic. Even though they claim otherwise the whole game screams mobile port.On it's own Godus Wars currently seems to be a nice 5-bucks time-waster. Neat graphics, simple gameplay and short missions are great for a quick session on your phone. As a PC game however, it still as a long way to go. There might be a good game here somewhere, but, given 22Cans history, I highly doubt that they will ever find it. This could have been the next ""Populous: The Beginning"" but at the moment it's just a shallow RTS with some sculpting mechanics clearly designed for mobile platforms. Avoid.And, for ♥♥♥♥s sakeit has micro-transactions in it! AGAIN!After you finish the first island, just a few battles in, you have to pay 5 bucks to unlock the rest of the content. Great!Update - 2016-02-08Okay, micro-transactions are gone now.http://steamcommunity.com/app/422420/discussions/0/405690850603772892/In the mean time, its been brought to our attention that the extra content being a premium add on really isn’t a popular choice. Whilst we think that it does represent good value, especially considering that Godus Wars has been delivered as a free update to hundreds of thousands of users and the lower purchase price of the main game we understand previous Godus owners frustrations with this.Therefore, based on your feedback, the extra content will be available to all free-of-chargeHowever guys:Content you promised would be in the game is not extra content. Technically this update is free, but given that the base game feels like 90% of its promised features are missing it is nothing you can charge us for.I know that not getting paid for your work sucks. But, from our point of view, not getting what we paid for sucks even more. And if you than add insult to injury by hiding the majority of your singleplayer-only content behind a pay wall you shouldn't be surprised that people get upset.This would have maybe been okay if Godus Wars would come with a procedurally generate skirmish mode that adds replayability to it. But since the campaign is all we get you really can't expect us to pay for anything past the first few missions."

But while it’s seems to be a game where you kind of do the same kind of war over and over, it also gives you a sort of relaxation that I don’t find in many games, especially in games that has to do with war of any kind. Now, with that said, this relaxation also gets replaced with stress that comes from a feeling of having to hurry op. Now don’t think this game is a time management type of game, it’s not. No the stress comes from never knowing when the game is going to crash yet again. A crash is extremely likely in this game.I am a very patient person in general. I don’t mind a game crashes once in a while. But there is 2 factors here that make my blood boil:1: this game crashes a lot. I mean really often.2: there is no way to save the game in a battle.With these 2 factors combined I get kind of angry. Because this means that when the game crashes, you will have to start a battle all over again. The game does sometimes notice a crash and try to compensate by giving you keys. Keys you get after each battle to open for a new area. I’m not sure if you’ll lose any temporary cards though - cards that you use in battle to get advantages.Because of all this I amnotgoing to recommend this game, unless this is going to be fixed.I have no clue if that will ever happen, because of the disaster around Godus – their first game.Now also please do notice that this game is inearly access.

I also suppose they will somehow combine both games into one to make it more holistic and the revolutionary game they initially wanted to create. At the moment this is only presented as a separate game to Godus. You are given a world map with continents and try to conquer each part of the continent one by one. There are cards you obtain and deities to choose from but they really make very little difference to the strategy and gameplay. One opponent is at one end of the map and you are at the other. Very easy to conquer and very long but overly linear to reach the goal. After you have finished one continent the same process is renewed with other continents. Not sure what happens after you have conquered all continents but, as stated, the game is too tedious to try to find out.On a side note (since I'm a graphic designer and feel the need to comment on it) the ""blood"" aspect is way too present : The title screen, the animation... we get it, it's war.

Although it's been a long time since last time I played an strategy game, this looks different and new. I liked the ideas this game has.What I didn't like:- It crashes. A lot. At least when there's a champion as I said. Being winning a battle and getting a crash is not really pleasant.- There's a lack of descriptions everywhere. I would have expected the cards to have more information when clicking them, but it just zoom them. For example, I got the Quagmire card and still don't know what is it about.- There are only archers. I would like to be able to build an army of different units. But this is an early access, hopefully they would be added before the release.- Some more buildings could also be good. I get bored of just having to improve one. But the same, that can be added later.- Sculpting is sometimes really slow. If I press on a ground level it means I want to expand that level, so if there's something over it, I would like it to be removed. And if I expand it over a zone in a lower level, I would like it to increase all of the layers at the same time. I don't know if I'm the only one, but there are times I find myself just clicking and clicking, what is a bit annoying.- The UI is really poor. I would like more information about the game. For example, I don't really know if the believers increase during the game, but I think so, as you can also kill them. I would like to know how many I have. And I don't know if it's shown elsewhere, but it could be good to have it close to the mana.I think this game was just ""released"" (even if it's an early access) before it should, and I don't see the quality I was expecting. I understand some of the problems, but things like the game crashing every other game it's not really aceptable. Hopefully, it will get better. But right now I don't feel like I can recommend it."

,Not Recommended,422420,20957100,"Posted: 4 February, 2016",all,Feindfeuer,"Godus Wars includes both the original Godus and its new RTS spin-off Godus War. Which takes the Godus art assetts and clunky controlls, adds some blood and a bare-bones RTS interface that is just as terrible as the basic landscaping interface of the original game. Which should come as no suprise, as the terrible interface was the inspiration for the RTS spin-off.To quote Peter himself:""We’ve always loved the landscape forming, changing and sculpting but quickly realised that it’s slightly more uncomfortable to do a lot of sculpting with a mouse. Really what it lacked was brutality, was war, was the ability to take on challenge and use your god powers and sculpting powers to fight, war and battle. And that’s where our initial concept of Wars started.""Yes, Mr. Molyneux thought that the interface was terrible, and his idea of improving on that was to do a completly different game with the exact same interface.The RTS content is lack-luster and in the first missions it's just down to whomever builds the barracks first so he can kill the enemy barracks. Which is not really a challenge as the AI is rather lacking in aggression. This might change later ingame, but with the minimalistic approach to the RTS genre I couldn't get myself to play for long enough to see more content... or if there is even more content at all.The game tries to freshen up the RTS mechanics by adding god-ability cards that you win in battles and than can use as one-time resource boosts or ingame abilities. Once used they are gone and you'll have to regrind them from the lower missions that you did before. You also get randomized extra-rules in each battle that might give extra damage for having a hight advantage or increase the cost of god powers... with all that thought going into how to 'freshen up the RTS genre' one wonders why there are so many basics just missing, like a mini-map for example.tl;drminimalistic RTS that may be fun if you just want to see low-poly bow-men shoot at helpless farmers for 10 minutes between loading screens but doesn't offer anything interesting. This might change later on, as it's still early access, but if the original Godus is any indication I wouldn't get my hopes up."

,Not Recommended,422420,20964468,"Posted: 5 February, 2016",all,[BS] Lol U Mad,"First of all I just have to congratulate the devs for this record-breaking game. I don't think any game has ever received such a high percentage of bad reviews compared to good ones. Godus: Wars has even managed to beat Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing. It is the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (Atari 2600) of our time. Seriously this is so bad it may warrant a new ""Do you recommend this game?"" choice that is lower than ""no"". If you can think of the worst thing possible to ever exist and multiply it by 2, you would have this game. It's like when you go see a live performance that is so terribly bad you feel embarassed for even being there to behold it.This game is a collection of gameplay elements that sound fun if done properly, but don't work well together or the way they were implemented. Some worked with Vanilla Godus, but some were still bad and were even worse when combined with combat.All in all you have to be a real masochist to enjoy this game. It is frustratingly punishingly slow and annoying to the point of actual outright suffering. I can't think of anything at all in this game anybody in their right mind would consider fun.There are so many annoyances in this game. I don't think there could be more annoyances if they were trying to pack as many in there as they could ON PURPOSE. I mean seriously, did none of this come up in the meetings? Did the developers even try to play this before they released it? It is so bad it is hard to say where I should even start.First of all I have never liked the terraforming. It has been implemented in a way that just does not work well with a mouse. You end up clicking and dragging the same spot 500 times just to make a tiny area of land. This might not be so bad if it weren't such an important part of the game and if it weren't combined with the need to get it done fast because now you have an enemy doing the same thing but he doesn't have to ♥♥♥♥ around with a mouse. The terraforming♥♥♥♥♥♥implemented as it is now does not work well at all for a combat-oriented game where everything is time sensitive. Leave it for the casual game, not the war game. If anything, let the NPCs do it.Secondly, the pathing is♥♥♥♥♥♥ The troops tend to run back and forth not knowing where they need to go, or run around in circles while being shot at. You are pretty much forced to control the warbands independantly because the pathing is even worse when you try to combine them into an army. They should replace the combat units with headless chickens, it would be more realistic.One of the most annoying things about this game is the lack of any way to navigate the map with any convenience. Your troops are slaughtered so you need to make another army fast but your base is on the other side of the map so you have to slowly scroll there while your armies are fighting and dying. I guess Godus is too cool for a minimap.Half the time when you add a new warband to your army it just sits there and doesn't bother trying to get to the rest of the army. I wouldn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥either if I were them, it's not like they will do any good anyway.When attacked by enemy troops, your army will shoot buildings and just let the enemy kill them. I guess I would be suicidal too if I were a character in this terrible game.When the enemy is standing on the mission objective you cannot target them. Even when they are sitting out in the open with nothing near them it is STILL hard as ♥♥♥♥ to target them. It's like walking over to this building is more important than shooting something that is killing you.You have to deactivate a god power before you can click on anything else. Very annoying, especially when you forget it is activated. One would expect it to be automatically deactivated when you try to do something else. God powers are pretty useless anyway. Might as well remove them completely. In fact remove the whole game and replace it with RTS elements that are already established that people expect to be in a RTS game becuase they work.You can still squish houses to your base even after it is maxed. There is no feedback at all letting you know if it is even doing anything anymore. I liked it better when I could just use gold to upgrade a base. ""Squishing"" doesn't make anything more fun.Each zone of each island is exactly the same. It feels like there is no progression at all. How can this game take up 3 gigs when there are only like 4 art assets?Reward cards are terrible. Really I just spent an hour so I could get 4 extra followers for the next stage? Maybe if they were PERMANENT it would be sort of worth it.If you alt tab out of the game and get back into it, the window is now slightly underneath the windows task bar. Congratulations now you can't see half your UI.WTF 2 game windows? How does this enhance the game again?It is a repetitive game of attrition. Make armies, go shoot houses until your armies have intentionally killed themselves, repeat (and hopefully you slowed down their army generation by at least 1%). How is this fun?Peter, if you are going to try to be innovative, why not do it with something we WANT to see like a sequal to Populous or Theme Park? So bite the bullet and pay for licensing, it would be cheaper than total failures like these. I couldn't even tell you how to save this one, it is such a big failure I don't think anything can be done.  The only way to make this game more fun that it is now is if it did everything itself and all you had to do was watch.Then again maybe I am wrong about all this. Maybe they were trying to make a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game on purpose to win some 'worst game of the'.. EVER... awards. Well, ""congrations, you winner !""."

Take the good aspects of Black & WhiteMerge them into a game.This is not what we asked for. Godus Wars, in theory, is a step in the right direction. However, this has absolutely no impact on the main game (as of yet), and to be honest feels rather pointless. All that work going into building your cities? Doesn't matter. All the victories in here? Doesn't matter.It's just frustrating. Many of us can see exactly what needs to be done, but the developers appear oblivious. The potential is through the roof, but nothing is being done with it.It doesn't need to be the next Crusader Kings in terms of complexity, but how about not producing such a dumbed down, casualised game? Add some complexity, make it have an impact in regular Godus, actually update and improve regular Godus instead of just dropping it in favour of this.Some communication with the customers wouldn't go amiss either.

It has been ages since it started development thus may never actually be completed.Godus Wars, formerly Godus, is two games in one. In one game you modify the world making yourself a colony more powerful than all others thus end up taking control of the entire landscape. In the other game you conquer the world using the exploration mechanics of Godus.. which I can’t figure out how to actually start playing.In Godus you sculpt the landscape thus making it easier or more difficult for your people to navigate resulting in either safety or increased migratory potential. You sacrifice your followers or even use the exploration features to conquer new worlds for resources. You also gain extra resources from treasure chests. These resources you may spend on your tech tree, gifts, shrines, settlements, or powers to give your people the greatest chance of survival.In Godus Wars.. I imagine you use the exploration feature available in Godus to conquer areas for keys, items, and other resources. After you conquer an area you gain resources to spend further upgrading your populace. I have no way to verify this because in its current distribution Godus Wars doesn’t seem to work thus this explanation is a more in depth explanation of the exploration features of Godus.Sadly, the creators gave up on Godus Wars for now and the main developer moved to a different project then left his game development company who owns Godus Wars completely… so the game is, in my opinion, unlikely to ever be finished. Its original vision is gone and the direction it will be taken if finished is probably different than the creator intended.Due to my previous statements I’ll have to give Godus Wars a 80 out of a possible 100. It’s a good game that will probably never be finished and I think that 80 is fair and would be a relatively average rating among those who review it. Godus really is a very good game and is bound to be great if ever finished.If you enjoyed my content don’t forget to like, comment, and subscribe! Thanks for watching and have a great day!"

They should bring back the need to harvest crops and mine for ore - making it a little more of a traditional RTS.While the game is free for people who already own Godus, I don't think this game would stand up as a purchase for newcomers, it is just too bare bones as it is right now.They should also find a way to eliminate the need for two windows being open when playing the game - it's just clunky and I can't think of many games that need this.To conclude, I would like to see the game build on unit and building variety and find new ways to make the game more strategic and less casual (maybe introduce a 'Hardcore' mode, for people who want a more traditional RTS experience - adding all the elements that fans of the genre have come to expect).I like what Godus and Godus Wars are trying to do (have clocked about 72 hours for both games combined) but I can't help but feel both games are only scratching the surface of their potential - POTENTIAL being something that this series has in spades."

They've made among one of the biggest mistakes that I've ever seen a gaming company make. In some ways, I hate them too.However, I'm not reviewing 22cans, and it would be unfair to let previous iterations of Godus affect my review of this game (or this part of the game). Lots of people are, so be aware. If I were buying this early-access game afresh with no knowledge of what came before, I'd find it very enjoyable. The content is a little bare, but it's great fun. Especially in the later levels, it's a real challenge, and you get a buzz from defeating all the opponent god's armies. I'd recommend it. Don't let your previous experiences tar your opinion of this game, and that goes for reviewers and people reading the reviews."

76561198030167683,Recommended,422420,20943565,"Posted: 3 February, 2016",all,Dermit,"The ever-innovative Peter Molyneux pulls another phoenix from its ashes with his latest award-winning blockbuster hit,The RevenantGodus Wars. And If you're an avid stategy-gamer as I am, you'll want this in your library. Why? Well here are four reasons why Godus Wars should be on your RTS wishlist this Christmas season:1. Challenging UI- How do you make the element of difficulty in an RTS unique and refreshing? Make the UI so cluttered and unnecessary that the main menu itself requires a strategy. Then, while the game has seemingly started, block out the ""Exit Game"" option in the menu screen.2. Pathing-  Pathing is a quintessential aspect of all RTS games, which is why Molyneux knew he had to reinvent it to stand out. His solution? Use minimal programming, blame any problems on dynamic terrain, and then make it so that right-clicking is both the unit position command and the only way to move the camera fluidly. Didn't hold down the mouse button long enough after you clicked? Guess where your unit is going.3. Buffer Overflow-  To give your games more close-to-home difficulty, losing even a single match inserts malicious batch executables into random string values in your client, disabling your Data Execution Protection and attacking your computer memory relentlessly.4. Dune II- Essentially, Godus Wars is a reboot of Dune II, one of the greatest RTS games known to man. Molyneux's reinvisioning of the classic strategy game incorporates only its best elements with new standards in visuals and performance not capable in the early 90's.5. Supportive Community- Important to every developing Early Access title is an active and friendly community of developers and moderators. Continuing the trend set by the original Godus, Godus Wars is host to exactly that. If the slightest problem occurs, your reported issues and concerns areclosedhandledefficientlyby 22Cans and its moderators."

Godus was a genius, if flawed game, beautiful to play - though with no ending and ""less"" than promised, even with hours of play.Godus Wars first release is promising, though buggy and unbalanced.  Get your archer's experience to a gold ""super archer"" and they just destroy everything.  Though controlling a bunch of archers is difficult, even tedious when they do their own thing and die.  Moving a group of archers sends them in all directions, probably just to die.  Better to control them individually.  The game crashes frequently for me too.Anyway, kudos to 22 cans for trying to release more of Godus.  This first release leaves a lot to be desired, but I hope they can do so."

Godus Wars takes everything I liked about Godus (the art style, the scultping) and drops into a much more exciting game that feels like it has a lot more purpose.  I love the idea of the belief vault so you don't have to spend all your time clicking to collect and if this is the direction the game is heading, then I for one am really excited.  Even at this early stage it feels like a Molyneaux game in a way Godus never did, liuttle touches like the funny messages before battles start serve to give it a lot more character.  It's early days, but I'm already enjoying what they have here, I can't wait to try out multiplayer when it launches.  Peter, as a long time fan of your work, from Populus onwards, I think this is brilliant and I can't wait to see what happens next."

Changing recommend *barely* to not recommended.______________________________I've played for a few hours now, so I feel like I can give an honest review of Godus Wars.To premise, I have play tested godus quite a bit back when it was actively being updated: about a year ago.  I put in 175+ hours, though probably 50 of that was leaving it on when I went to bed, since the first few interations had relatively slow belief respawn times.I've seen Godus when it was new - lots of bugs, but relatively fun.  Then, cleaning the slate and beginning again.  I didn't like the second attempt as much as I liked the first, but I still play-tested and reported bugs here and there.  And then *it* happened - i.e. the game was released on mobile platforms and that was when **** hit 22cans.  The production of the game basically died, forums exploded in rage, Peter asked if he was pathologically a liar, etc.Now, a YEAR since the last update, I can say I am pleased that this little game came out - *finally, something*.  I am going to base this game against populous, and against the previous Godus (which comes with this game if you want to play it).Against populous:  This game is very simple in it's current form.  On the first continent there is only 2 units: the villager, and the archer.  Another unit, the catapult, appears for the enemy on the second continent, but I never was able to use it myself.  Compare this to Populous, which had 7.  From an RTS standpoint, having so few attack unit types seems silly.  They do level up, which makes for some differentiation between the different units, but their movement and attack patterns are the same.In populous, you had a shaman who cast the powerful ""god-like"" spells.  In Godus Wars, you can sculpt land but your spells are limited to those you bring with you, in the form of cards.  You get 4 cards per match, and you gain cards as you progress through the continent. (I have completed second continent, so my review at this time doesn't deal with any continents after that).  I don't like this aspect of the game and I feel it needs work, or some sort of explanation or reasoning.  Why does a God have to choose only 4 spells?One big thing - the sculpting is much more enjoyable and comfortable in Godus Wars than in Populous.  Also, I like the updated graphics.  In most ways, however, Populous beats Godus Wars from an RTS level.Against Godus:  These two games are very different.  Most of the time you spend in godus is spent in a zen-like state or half-subconscious state where you are just doing things and clicking on things.  What is the goal?  It's hard to say... you are doing things for kinda whatever you want.  Back when you built roads to make settlement types, that was probably my favorite thing to do for some reason.  Anyways, Godus it's NOT a great revisioning of populous.  External threats don't present themselves for a very long time, and dealing with those threats is like dealing with pesky ants.  They are really just an annoyance, and can be very difficult to exterminate.(once you get into hub world, from building the boat on your home world.)You are limited in strange ways in Godus.  Ex. Your villagers are dependent on you for all resource gathering (wtf).Godus Wars does not suffer in this way.  Belief is automatically collected.  It is the only resource at the moment.  So, rescource management wise it feels much better and in-line with a god game for me.  I hope they re-add the resources for some purpose, and they are still auto-collected.  In general, more depth needs to be added to Godus Wars.General review of Godus/Godus Wars:  I truely would personally like to see a true God Game where villagers make up their own minds, and maybe your actions determine behaviors or characteristics of the culture within your people.  Gods do not manually control people or cause wars.  They influence belief systems and THAT can lead to conflicts within differing cultures.  I think 22Cans needs to really reconsider what they have going here in general.  For more info reference the predestination forum thread in origional Godus...So in conclusion:  Do I recommend Godus Wars?  I think it is close, but yes.  I find that when I finish a match I'd like to play another, and that is how I base if I am enjoying playing a game or not.It is a milestone between Godus and Populous.  The game does not suffer from the click-fest of resource collections that Godus had, but as an RTS Populous has more depth to the strategy.  However, it has a LONG WAY TO GO TO BE A FULL GAME, but also HAS THE POTENTIAL TO LEAD TO A GREAT GOD RTS GAME NOW.  I would only recommend it to people with patience, and who are willing to really wait on the game.direct issues with the game:So few unit types.I don't like the cards, also the cards are poorly explained.  Ex.  What does leech do?  Steal health? belief? I think there would be some better way to handle limiters.Did they take away screen rotation?ZERG RUSH FTW.Dev review:  22Cans -  All I can say is, Why? I playtested you Godus game for a very long time.  Checked forums on steam regularly.  I know you were getting lots of kick-back on the forums, but you can't just disappear like you did.  It may be tempting to abandon the community, but you know what?  There are people on there who care about this project.  You did a great dis-service to them by going dark like that.  You have to live above the vitriol.  Please. don't. go. silent. again.edit: mainly spelling issues, also there appears to be a second attack unit type on the second continent."
