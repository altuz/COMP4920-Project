,Recommended,422500,29932809,Posted: 14 February,all,gene357,First I see a ton of potenial for this game. The horse riding experiance was great.I see several areas for improvement but this is just a demo and the release could be aways out.I do like the experiance with the game and what is trying to do.If done right this could be a very good game.

76561198031008673,Recommended,422500,29933653,Posted: 14 February,all,ProfChaos2000,I love the idea. Some mechanics need a lot of work. The horseback riding mechanic is a good start but stopping the horse feels unatural. It would be better if pulling straight back stopped the horse rather than raising hands up. Also there should proabably be an easier way of turning the horse around when it gets stuck against a tree. The magic was cool but when I hit someone with a large object it should look like I hit them rather than them clipping through it.Overall I love where the game is going but I wanted to leave some feedback because this is obviously a prototype intended for the developers to gather information.

After selecting my locomotion option (teleportation, I known the limits of my stomache) I was faced with a small group of slightly blurry characters talking around a fire. After an abortive attempt to find a menu I could use to make them a little less blurry, I listened to their short argument and was invited to head back to town with one of them.On horseback.Horses in Emerhalt are controlled by manipulating the reins, but turning ones head to look around also seems to alter thier directing in a disconcerting, and nausea inducing way. By the time we reached the first corner I was starting to feel quite nauseus and hoping the journey would be over soon, unfortunately the town wasn't even on the horizon yet. By the time we eventually reached the town (which seemed like an eternity, even discounting the short break I took to ensure I wouldn't be physically sick) and I finally recieved the instructions on how to dismount from the acursed beast, I had well and truely decided that that would be the last virtual horse of Emerhalt I ever mounted.After a short walk through the town I was reunited with my former compatriots from around the fire, who had aparently been having a drinking contest. Between them they drunkenly came to the conclusion that we should all participate in a horse race.And so my experiences in Emerhalt came to a close.My susceptibility to motion sickness isn't the least extreme, but nor is it the most, and I wouldn't ask developers to leave features others might enjoy out of a game just because they make me feel sick. But I would ask that they strongly consider not making those features a mandatory, unskippable, part of the game. (I think there are probably some things that could be done to make horse riding less unpleasant, but it may be something that is always going to make some people feel a bit queasy, it would be nice to be able to play the other parts of the game anyway)."

There are a lot of cool things in this demo that could easily be made better with simple tweaks, like adding motion control feedback with the shield or striking anything really.  The hands felt slightly off to me too, like they were in my wrists.  The inability to turn was aggrivating on both track pad and teleport.  I hope the team continues to devleop this game and really polish it up.  Can't wait to see a final version."

Really wanted to keep playing but man, the movement is not so good, especially on horseback where I was getting quite nauseous. The turning on the horse is especially stomach turning. Unfortunately I didn't get very far because of this."

Although this game doesn't do it particularly well, at least it's doing it and that gives me some hope for the future. Check out this quick 25 minute demo and recommend it if you like it: that'll let developers know what we want, and hopefully put some polish on the barebones ideas like this to make real games."
76561198034652144,Recommended,422500,29972652,Posted: 16 February,all,spikeholden,"Pretty good for a demo.  I like where this is heading.  The magic was particularly innovative.  The horse riding is also a novel idea - but it made me feel the most sick any VR game has (I found keeping in a straight line helped).Like others have said, this does need some work.  The graphics are blurry at a distance and there is clipping around buildings.  Teleporting also seemed hit and miss."
76561198043447148,Recommended,422500,29926112,Posted: 14 February,all,FloppyPenguin,"It has a solid base to work off of and this could be the first story driven open world vrrpg like game that really takes off. That being said I have a couple of critiques. First of all the melee attack definitely needs haptic feedback, the weightlessness of the shield makes it seem as though you are flailing your arm around for no reason. Second of all the telekinesis doesn't have any proper way to throw back at an enemy other than moving your arm side to side, this is an issue that might not be able to be fixed since that's just the way telekinesis works (but it becomes frustrating trying to toss back at an enemy). Finally my biggest problem with the game is the blocky style of the graphics. Now don't get me wrong I actually prefer stylized graphics (overwatch) over realistic graphics (battlefield) but the character models are incredibly blocky and the non moving sky and the water textures are very immersion breaking. I wouldn't expect you guys to add lip syncing or anything but the faces definitely need a bit of an overhaul specifically the eyes. All that being said I would give the work so far a 7/10. I am very excited to see what else comes from this project."

I, like many of us I'm sure are dying for a good story driven adventure free roaming RPG to save us from the endless wave shooters.  This game seems to have a start in filling that void.  I like the option of trackpad and teleport.  I've really grown to like trackpad locomotion and have over come my motion sickness from it for the most part, but with this type of locomotion, where you move in the direction your head is pointing instead of where your hand is pointing,. I just would rather be able to point where I'm going and tilt the controler to slow down if I need to and look around while I'm walking.  The graphics are terribly blurry.  That really needs to be fixed.  The horse back riding is a nice mechanic even though I found that it was pretty touchy especially when you were walking and not galloping and had a tendency to make me feel a bit sick.  There were several bugs,.. walking into the town I must have dismounted my horse before I was supposed to and the controls for dismounting floated in front of me the whole time I was in the village.  there were serveral loud voices that seem to yell at me from every direction and that was a bit odd since there was only one person I could see in the village besides the group I met up with before the horse race.  The voice acting was a bit cheesy.  Also,. this is just my own personal preference here and I know many disagree and that's cool,. but when I'm playing as a character in a VR game it really kills it for me when the game starts talking for me.  That was my one complaint about Arizona Sunshine.  I'm the character, it's my adventure, let me be the character and don't tell me what I think.  The battle play was actually pretty cool.  could definatily use some force feedback or something and I would probably make it so the giant boulders don't just roll away like a basket ball when you barely run into them.  there was another strange bug when I walked into the fishery where a string of bright purple text that said hello over and over in a colum on the left side of my screen showed up and never went away the rest of the demo.   obviously I wouldn't reccomend this game in it's current state but that doesn't mean with a lot of work it couldn't turn out to be something pretty great.  but now it's just not"

,Recommended,422500,30108313,Posted: 22 February,all,Dozenbeer,"Love the idea of a grand scale RPG in Vr and it really feels good......with some downsides.Pros:+ horse riding was fantastic+ gaining magical powers really felt good+ exploration outside the given path+ teleportation and locomotionCons:- the voice acting was terrible, overacted and amateurish- I didnt like the graphics, very blurry even from afar, too cartoony- the story didnt feel as strong as it should beStill I would love to see what comes out of this. RPG in VR is definitely a good idea."

That being said I'll start reviewing it.GRAPHICS:+I like the level design a lot. Very fantasy like and it really immerses you in the game. Keep it like that!.. That's about it really.STORY:+The story was decent. Of course you'll be left out with more questions than answers. But the story is good enough for you to play through the entire game.+I did like them adding side quests, although there are only 1 or 2 it's something that could make this VR game more unique.-It is very cliché and most of it was to be expected before it even happened. I like stories with suprises though this one did not give me one.+-CAN SOMEONE SHUT THAT B* UP WHEN I AM NOT IN THE MOOD TO CONTINUE THE STORY! Thanks in advance :)MUSIC:+ It fits the environment and it is beautifully done!GAMEPLAY:Phew okay here comes the interesting one.+Horses. The horses were weird at first but I loved using it during my playthrough! Of course if you're sensitive about such movements then this game is really not for you.+-Your magical powers can sometimes be quite clunky.-The boss battle was terrible and confusing. It just doesn't make any sense. I even got him to glitch through a rock :OOverall it's a good start for a game. I look forward for the full version!7/10 + 0.1 for being a free game."

It's the first time a VR game has had this affect on me. Visuals are blurry at distance, so overall optimisation is an issue with this game as the graphics are not exactly cutting edge.There's some effort in the content, the horse riding in VR is neat. And there's a story and voice acted characters. But overall it's quite an amateurish prodction all around. I do still feel travel sickness queasy writing this review 5 minutes after quiting the game."

76561198111926404,Recommended,422500,30099082,Posted: 22 February,all,Ztolle,"Emmerholy its an amazing free to play game on steam It was recommended to me by a friend and it did not disappoint. It is everything you could possible want from a virtual reality game. First off, let me start by saying that this game runs so smoothly for being a new VR game. You do not know how disappointing it is to buy a new game on steam that you’re really looking forward to, then it continuously crashes while starting up or when you’re playing the game which is even more frustrating. So far I have had ZERO issues while playing this and I am sure that if anything would arise, it would be quickly patched. Now let’s move onto the graphics of this game. ABSOLUTLY STUNNING to play. You can tell that attention to detail was important to the creators and wanted to give the gamer the best views. Even the background scenery can be admired while playing through different portions of the game. When it comes to actually gameplay, this game gets even better. Each new area of this game is designed differently giving players new challenges at every turn making the game continuously fun and never boring. Overall I recommend this game to anyone who is new to VR gaming! It is a great first game to start out with and I cannot wait to continue playing."

All in all an exciting title for the Vive looking at the promised content for the game, just hope they deliver, thumbs up."

Dev asked me what happened, I sent him a crash file, few days later he messages me back saying im all set go have fun :) I like that, and this game.So is this in its infancy? yes.  Could the graphics use a little tweaking? sure.Overall, pretty promising for an early version. Looking forward to seeing where this goes.There's a shortage of open world RPG adventure games, and done right, this could fill that void.Will be buying this when released just off the demo :)"
,Recommended,422500,30142514,Posted: 24 February,all,War Machine,"Wow, this demo really impressed me. I downloaded because it was free and had a horseriding mechanic, which I have yet to see in any other VR game. All I expected was ahorse ridinggame and thats what is was for the first couple minutes.... but after that... what I got was a cool""supernaturalish""type RPG withawesome powersand story with good potential. I feel that any future promotion for the full game needs to focus more on the powers and abilities so that people like me don't write it off immediately.Now, this game seems like it could be really cool, but there are some things that bother me, especially the ""fuzziness"" of the enviroments. The graphics need to be much sharper.  Also as other have said, the voice acting could be better and the characters lips don't move when they talk. The direction of the NPC's voices was always off, every time they would talk it would sound like their voice was coming from behind me or the side of me. The horseriding was good, and I'm not susceptible to VR sickness, but I could definitely see how the turning mechanic on the horse could make people sick easily (it feels disorienting even for me). Lastly, the AI in the ""boss fight"" needs some tuning, as sometimes I'd be standing right infront of him and he would not attack at all. That whole fight in general needs some more direction for the player, bc I wasn't sure if I was supposed to use telekinesis on him or use the shield to parry him. His armor and weapon were sick though!Anyway, if this game has other RPG elements like weapons/ armor equiping and more powers then it would be an instant buy for me.  TRY THIS DEMO! It's a great and it's free!"
,Recommended,422500,30148975,Posted: 24 February,all,WhyKlef,"This game as got my interest piqued if for the least.The voice acting is overplayed, the very bland uninspiring graphics leave to be desired, often the ratio of the world vs. character feels off (or the developers are very tall) BUT, despite all that, the game takes a very interesting turn when you are given your powers.This is a prologue and it shows and the claims that this game make (written on stones at the end of the prologue) are vague and scary to be honest but if they do deliver on what they promess and have a good package as well as a reasonable price, I feel like this game could be the new VR RPG must-play title which, in my opinion, goes to Vanishing Realms as it is.So in summary, this game has very good potential. And when comparing this with some other VR titles, everything I've already mentioned can easily be excused and looked past, that is when the game truly starts to shine.I'll keep a close eye on that one. Looks promessing.On another note, I'd like to say that, because the developers didn't charge for that demo shows good faith. So I am willing to ""bet"" in favor of this game turning out better than worst. I feel like it's the kind of dev team that will put in the effort because they have an honest desire to put something good out there.Time will tell, if you've got 20 minutes to spare, give it a try."
