That being said, I won my first playthrough as continental army/patriots on default difficulty and I enjoyed the game.Interesting game mechanics - turns are random every round and your turn consists of 3 phases - reinforce -> move -> battle. You draw 3 random cards at the beginning of your turn and play them during one of the three phases depending what the card is. Sometimes the French/Hessians will show up to reinforce you, sometimes you will pull a warship movement enabling you to hit your opponent from any coast, and sometimes you won't get a movement at all. In my opinion this randomness makes you think on your feet and makes the game pretty enjoyable.I was worried this would be too much like Risk and it really isn't. It's fairly unique."

Simple to learn but suprisingly deep, it trades tactical and strategic complexity for a simple ruleset that accurately simulates the Revolutionary War without bogging you down in minutiae.  The 'Truce Card' is a brilliant way to reflect civilian morale and military depletion.  The AI for the single player is competent but not perfect; I think new players will probably be a little frustrated at first until they grasp the subtleties, but even experienced players can hone their skills."

I never played the physical verison of 1775: Rebellion but I imagine this game plays very similiar to it. I have been playing war board games for 20 years and this game is right up my alley So far I have played 3 complete games, 1 American and 2 British, and I feel that I could play many more before the game begins to lose it's replay value.Games typically take about an hour to complete against normal AI settings, playing the standard long game. I have not yet played the shorter game or the Seige of Quebec. Will probably play those after my current playthrough. I also havn't tried the multiplayer.I have found a few bugs in the game but nothing that will break the game or ruin your game."

I do wish that the combat resolution could be a bit quicker. Chhosing my casualties is quite slow, and I have to wait for execution after selecting every unit.Note to developer: The opening movie is pretty useless and low-end. On the next one, I wouldn't waste resources on this. Just a nice splash screen and music is fine."

76561198099086287,Recommended,422610,26276468,"Posted: 28 October, 2016",all,Drako,"I am experienced player of the original board game. I bought this PC version of the game when it first came out and the developers has done a great job fixing all the bugs. They have been very responsive. Currently at v1.05 I have yet to find any bugs. At its hardest level the AI can be beaten many times but not  easily. The AI is challenging and requires your concentration. However, the AI doesn't always make smart moves and on rare occasion, very ridiculous moves that would cost the AI the game. I have been beaten by the AI a couple times and in one game, it ended in a draw.I can't say anything for multiplayer because I haven't tried it yet. The AI is worh playing in a solitare game and preps me for the board game with friends when I haven't played it in a long time. This game is worth buying for both new and experienced players of the original board game."

In fact, after playing the computer game, I learned my friends and I were overlooking a rule in the board game regarding unit placement. While I prefer the board game over the video game, I nonetheless am glad to have purchased this game.  Why? Beacuse I can play and enjoy the game anytime."

,Recommended,422610,26049194,"Posted: 15 October, 2016",all,rpisarzjr,"Overall, 1775 does a great job in translating a good board game to the PC. If you don't mind playing an AI that is less than competitive --- even on the hardest setting --- or you just want to learn the rules of the game playing solitaire you will enjoy this title. I found the graphics and art appropriate.If you are like me and want to play the game with other people then that is where 1775 fails miserably. While the game states it supports multiplayer --- several types of multiplayer --- in it's current implementation it is not usable. The ""online"" multiplayer is really glorified play by email but worse. When it comes time for your opponents turn the game screen closes to the main menu --- you are not able to even view the board! --- and all decisions that are supposed to involve you are  handled by the AI (poorly?). In reality you are playing when it's only your turn or 50% of the time. Completely unaccpetable. Once I discovered this I decided to try the local multiplayer thinking the developers provided this option knowing that some people will not enjoy the asynchronous, let the AI make my moves during the other persons turn and during this time I see none of what transpires option. It works extremely well EXCEPT information that is supposed to be private --- the cards in the current player's hand --- are publicly visible with no ability to hide them. A simple click-to-show option solves the problem but is missing.For me the lack of a functional multiplayer option is a dealbreaker. Had I known in advance how multiplayer is implemented I definitely would not have purchased the game at any price let alone the $25 retail price. I am hopeful HexWar is planning enhancements to the multiplayer functionality, but they have not responded to my inquiries on this topic.[EDIT] HexWar has been extremely responsive and added a feature to allow toggling card visibility so there is at least one viable multiplayer option. Now, with a an optional multiplayer mode our group can actually play the game."

I haven't seen anything outside of the rules, and have had some rules clarified for my own play by watching the AI.  Game is enjoyable, but beating the AI is pretty easy on the hardest level.  I have played like 20 games and none have really been too close.  The longer the game goes the worse the AI gets beat.  Its only hope for victory is to get both truce cards played early and truce out, and that was maybe the only time I felt like I might lose.This AI needs a lot of work.  It makes underpowered attacks, which absolutely detroys its game, as the attack fails and the AI loses lots of armies.  The AI also make silly underpowered spoiler attacks that are maybe programmed to bleed the enemy but since the defender fires first, it jus bleed the AI with no loss to the human players.   It makes little use of the native armies.  Probably the only thing it does pretty well is to use the boats and ships.  AI also does not concentrate force to take a colony, it makes like 3 good attacks but since all in different areas without purpose to take a colony they inherently fail.Want fun for a few games against AI then this game will provide it.  If you have never played the boardgame you can gain an appreciation for some good mechanics here.  The designer makes sure your never really out of it in this game, as the dreaded problem of one side dominating early and the other side never able to catch up since resources are gained by early victory is avoided in this sim as reinforcements are pretty static, a few bonuses gained with card play.  Clever.Also the Quebec scenario stalls.  Either plays no turn or just one then sits...fix please."

76561198071724942,Recommended,422610,29367331,Posted: 19 January,all,Latios,"I nice little game based on the real board game. It includes some amature intro which shows very little, but explains what the game is about. The dice rolls are real enough.Although who the hell counts a tipped die!? I sure don't. Needs to be flat on the board to count.Gameplay wise the A.I. is decent at it's job, and it includes online play. My only complaint...the achivments don't seem to work at all. I recomend this small board game if you like such board games with very simple mechanics and Risk style play."

A couple of bugs in the game - I noticed the Injuns cannot command option out after a battle a couple of times.Overall - I am not sure I want to recommend this game. It is an OKAY implementation of the boardgame - but seriously slow. And, the funnest part of the boardgame is the human player interaction - which obviously this will not have."

Speaking of dice rolls, the computer seems to have loaded dice. I'll send my massive army only to have half of them run away, while the rest get cut down by the tiny army of the computer's - nine times out of ten, it rolls hits. It's like the Keystone Cops armed with plastic cutlery versus 1/2 a T-800. It suffers from the same the cheaty-mc-cheat-cheat dice from 2007's RISK."

The issue I have with this version of the game is that it's not at all like playing someone at the same table.  You can't see the opponents moves.  You can't even be in the game when your turn is done.  You get booted back to the main screen at the end of your turn.  If you want to play asynch it's fine I guess, but if you want to play someone live as if you're at a virtural table this version of the game is terrible for that.  Terrible.  Waste of my money."
