You hold m1 and alternate pressing A and D, there's no need to pay attention as there is no punishment for being hit by hazards as you'll continue to level up in-game regardless. The leveling system does nothing but unlock achievements and you'll reach Lv.329 easily in around 30 minutes.The most enjoyable part of Super Duper Flying Genocide 2017 is uninstalling it."

You aren't really making anymore money this way.This game is purely for achievements but honestly... if you want good achievements for a showcase then buy Lyne, Zup etc because the games are actually fun as well as it having pretty damn good achievements for your achievement showcase!"

(has 500 easy achievements)The screenshots on the store page show the game is horizontal, but it was vertical for me with massive black bars at the sides, i guess it's a mobile game. Also you can't turn the sh*tty music off which is annoying cos i was listening to my own GOOD music at the time.*Update (apparently it doesn't like resolutions above 1080p, it might be Horizontal for you)It's the easiest achievement bait game i've played to actually get the achievements though, and only takes half an hour. If you plan on buying it as an actual game (lol) and not for achievements then DON'T, unless you really like hoovering sh*t up while being forced to listen to sh*tty music.Lyne i enjoyed, zup i enjoyed to an extent, slash it i enjoyed to a far lesser extent, but one of it's modes was bearable. This one i didn't enjoy at all, i'm not giving it a thumbs up just cos of the achievements, come on third rate devs try sliiiightly harder than you are.

So if you are into that by all means get this game.The gameplay of this game however, is very stale. Variety is almost nonexistent, the only thing which changes is the background of the map.

,Not Recommended,422870,30549151,Posted: 16 March,all,ErickaUnlimited,"OverviewSuper Duper Flying Genocide 2017 is a 2D-style game that involves controlling a spaceship and abducting what appears to be “people” on a few artistically different levels to an obnoxiously annoying noise loop. There is no tutorial or means of being taught what to because, frankly, the gameplay is as nonexistent as it comes. When you start the game, you’ll be given control of a UFO spacecraft piloted by a “doge” avatar. Your mission is to abduct the three types of people in the time limit given to complete the level. If you still can’t figure it out [I don’t know how you couldn’t], there will be giant green arrows indicating what figures you need to capture.During the level, you’ll earn coins, which have no real applications other than buying new avatars on the main menu screen, making them all but pointless unless you feel the urge to change it. To earn coins, you abduct people, getting hit by enemies will deduct coins from your total. As mentioned, since coins don’t matter and you have no real health meter and ultimately can’t die, dodging enemy projectiles are pointless; just get hit by them.Essentially, you can complete the game and every achievement by just holding the right mouse button and occasionally moving the ship back and forth over the spawning civilians until you finished the level. There are power-ups you can earn which drop more people to collect, or triple how many tractor beams you have deployed; none of them really do anything and, while initially timed, if you hold right-click the power-ups never dissipate as intended.Aside from abducting people to progress each level, you do have a left-click ability that allows you to fire a laser beam or sorts. However, it serves no real purpose, making it entirely useless. You’ll never once have to use it during the game so just ignore it.Once you complete all the levels, which look strangely more and more similar as you play, you’ll reach level 1,000, buy the last avatar, unlocking the final achievement and ending a roughly 70 minute grind fest to completion.ProsNone. There are no positive aspects to this game.ConsNo real gameplay or challenge of any kind.The music loops constantly.Zero replayability.Overall, Super Duper Flying Genocide 2017 is achievement grinding garbage; it offers no real entertainment and bolsters its sales from targeting those that want to inflate their achievement counter or decorate their Steam profile with badge-labeled achievements. I cannot recommend this title as it has no redeeming features of any kind and instead it stands as a shining example of why quality control is such an important thing to have. If you expected anything else from this game, then let the grammatical errors on the game's own description page be enough to deter you from purchasing this. If that's not enough, then perhaps this review will."

Your task is to shoot at ""humunculi"" or suck them into a vacuum beam. In order to complete a stage you must hunt down marked targets and will be rewarded with exp in return and a massive count of achievements that unlock for each level you gain in the process. This game has 1002 steam achievements, which can be obtained by following one simple and very mindless strategy, that will do you no good, except activate your ""Monkey Trigger"". Thank heavens this game can be completed in less than 2 hours. Even though it is very cheap and suitable for people, who are looking to buy games that boost their achievement number count by just playing for a short amount of time, this could've been done a lot better. I recommend saving the money for a different game of similar sorts, which are already out there on steam.

Such as, Zup 1&2 or slash it as some prominent examples of this kind.This game is of this kind, too. Although here, the game isn't remotely interesting or satisfying, like in the partially challenging slash it! or the intriguing, satisfying Zup!. Yes, I played and liked those games and - I fully admit - I bought this game because of it's achievements and the fact they're very easy.But here, the graphics look like they were made by an unprofessional 9yr old, there is no menu, there is unfunny use of memes, hell, even the absoltely trashy name should be an indicator of what awaits you here. It's just an insult to the buyer and frankly, games like these shouldn't be on steam. But that's a different discussion, about Valve, quality control and a flooded market. In any case, we don't need ""games"" like these. It's needless, pointless and annoying you with music and heavily unchallenging, boring ""gameplay"".Everything in this game is an insult to the buyer. It just points the middle finger towards you - ""$!(@+'*- you, for playing this"" is the only thing that's stuck with me from this game. The only thing this game has going for it is a load of achievements. Then again, they're not really achievements. They are also not the reason I've started 100%ing games in the first place - for challenge and skill. Sure, not all games are that way, but again, different discussion. With games like these becoming more common, it also dawns on me why some people downright hate achievements. I could go on on a diversity of topics here, but I regard that as highly pointless.TL;DR: We don't need trash like this. If I'm going to pay to get insulted for half an hour, I#ll go to the studio where a good looking lady in latex will await me and at least do her job professionally and give me a happy ending. This game ain't done anything of this. Will request a refund, first time doing this, not worth a penny.Edit after update and refund:So, after getting the game refunded, the Dev just added more pointless achievements - and, of course, I rebought the game because my idiotic mind wouldn't let me ""destroy"" my stats with 171 easily obtainable achievements left locked, so I pulled through again.I extremely regret my decision to buy and ""play"" this insult of a cashgrab, this cancerous stain (of many) on the steam store. It also saddens me to see 3/4 reviews being positive.Buy this game if you like enemas with vodka, root canal therapies, listening to Cher's music or bullet ant stings on your ding-dong."

This game is wonderful for achievement hunters, and you will get a lot of achievements in a short period of time to bump up your profile. If you're here to play a crappy game for a lot of achievements, don't let any of these reviews stop you.SDFG2017 is an unimaginative, repetitive experience that lacked any form of tutorial early on, most likely because the developer agreed that this game is just made for achievement gains only. While the game is simple to play (you are an alien spaceship trying to ruin the lives of humans, so you either suck them up or burn them) - it doesn't explain how to fight creatures with red arrows. While you can figure out combinations to hurt a few, you will probably be stuck letting a lot of these invincible creatures live......It's not like it matters anyway.That's right, these creatures can't actually hurt you, in fact you can't actually die. You can infinitely stay alive, all that happens when you are hit by a creature or an element summoned to hurt you is that you lose a coin per hit. You can go into the negatives, and coins won't help you get any achievements, they are just there solely for cosmetic ship changes.Overall, it's a great game for achievement hunting and boosting your profile up, but that's it, it's a really crappy game, and I couldn't wait for it to end, even though I really wanted that 100%. If you want an alright game with quick 100%  achievements, try the Zup! series."

I first started playing video games when I was around 4, and this game is a new and innovative feature to my already vast library. I first began printing posters of this game, and I taped them onto my walls. Every single wall. However, this was not enough. I felt a lust for Super Duper Flying Genocide 2017. I searched for a custom body pillow sight, and alas I found none. I had to create my own body pillow. I bought ufo and doge plushies, and created an abomination. I had taped the two together to create what I had long been searching for. This was not enough. I learnt sewing. I learnt printing. I printed my favorite super duper flying genocide 2017 art onto two identical pieces of cloth. Sewing the two together formed something incredible.Little did I know this was only the beginning of what was about to be. I educated myself in the craft of carpenting. I had to create the perfect parquet. This was not enough. I learnt how to paint, so I could paint on my parquett.I painted 10 000 parquettes for my largest room. Almost like a puzzle, when all the pieces got put together properly it formed a face. The face of a god. The face of an extreterrestial being. The face of the undying.

,Not Recommended,422870,29427785,Posted: 22 January,all,Dramamine,"I'm going to say upfront that I'm not an individual who dislikes these games that hand out massive amounts of achievements. Instead, my issues lie with this games quality.I presume this game (and its achievement count) was created due to the success of Zup! The difference? Zup! is actually entertaining for the 15-30m you'll get out of it. There's actually some form of a challenge in Zup! since you can technically fail a level and need to restart. There's literally nothing that stops you from failing in this game, nor can you die either. You'll be attacked through several means and all they do is cause you to lose coins or temporarily be unable to use your tractor beam. As I said before, you can't fail at this game. There's a level objective at the top, but it's meaningless as not completing it has no adverse effects on you. It doesn't reset the mission, the levels you obtained, or take away all of your coins.Speaking of coins, their only purpose is to buy a literal handful of 'hats' for your ship; but said 'hats' usually bug out and don't let you use the one you selected unless the game bugs out again and gives you the one you selected.The achievements you get (over 1,000 of them as of the newest update) are literally obtained from increasing your in-game level which you get from beaming up the people on the streets. Considering the attacks on you don't really do much, you can literally go as low as you can and strafe around beaming up people. The game takes roughly an hour to an hour and a half to get all of the achievements. It's really only worth farming if you have a dollar you truly want to spare and want tons of free achievements; but there are FAR better 1 dollar games on Steam.To me, it feels like a cash in on the idea of a cheap game with free achievements; but the biggest sin for me is that this game has absolutely no challenge or personality. It fails where Zup! succeeds by not providing even some form of engagement or entertainment factor.tl;dr: Game has no personality or challenge, boring and uninspired. Only get if you want to farm achievements."

Each level has a timer within which you must abduct the correct targets, helpfully pointed out with a green arrow over their sprites. Abducting sprites with a red arrow or being hit by hazards subtracts money, abducting sprites with green arrows or no arrows will gain you money. The two towers on either side of the map will disable your tractor beam. Periodically, there will be clouds that will shoot lighting at you and you will end with negative total money that level. There might be a trigger for this, like abducting the wrong creature, but I wasn't able to figure it out, so it appeared random. Other times, whole swarms of sprites will drop from the sky, like a surprise pinata. Sometimes your beam will upgrade to a more powerful version. The coins have no purpose except letting you buy different skins for your flying saucer. The game doesn't work very well, is poorly designed, and is frustrating.I don't know why I wrote this out, because none of that matters.This game has3295001002 achievements, and they can all be obtained within about30 minutesan hour of holding down RMB and alternating A and D. You get achievements for gaining levels and you gain levels by abducting sprites.Like the rush of cocaine, the half hour flashes before your eyes, and you're left with one less American dollarydoo in your wallet, three hundred and twenty nine new achievements, and one more perfect game. If at some point you begin to wonder why you are doing this, take some time to reflect on the pointlessness of life and achievement hunting. This game is the perfect metaphor for cheevo grinding: you have to do something tedious, but you get rewarded quickly, and then it's over and you can uninstall. And when you uninstall you feel dirty, like you've just thrown away a used needle. You look at your spoils and ask yourself: is this worth it? Am I wasting my life? Is this all I'm good for? Your eyes glaze over and you look at your other games: the achievement progress bar on that other game isn't full yet. A fleeting moment passes where you consider doing something else. It disappears as quickly as a startled bird. Back to the grind.10/10. Got it on sale, and the existential crisis was worth the 80 cents."

Graphics are simple, not necessarily ugly but really simple.I actively played the game for about 1.2 hours (reasons will be stated further down in the review) and I could not understand a lot of things, there was nothing like instructions how to play the game, and there was no goal, there were a lot of buffs that seemed to be dropped on random occassions, a large group of humans fell from the sky here and there, sometimes there were some kinds of robots that you couldn't kidnap and so much more. Basically this game confused me so much that I don't know how to continue with this review. There were so many types of enemies that were affecting you negatively but there was no explanation why, you were gaining money that were nearly useless to you, you could only buy skins for your UFO that you would lose if exitting the game, the money were reset back to 0 every round and you could go to -1000 money without a problem.There are so many more things that were weird and I didn't understand but I think those were enough as examples, this game could have had some potential but it just feels unfinished due to the majority of the features just working weird-ly.The only reason I bought the game were the trading cards and the 1002 achievements you can get now (possibly more being added in the future).The badges allowed you to get some nice emoticons that are identical to steam level icons (level 20, level 50, level 90, level 100 and such), if you got the level 100 emoticon from crafting one badge, you would probably make a profit if you were to sell it on market afterwards.The achievements will take around 1 hour of active grinding and exitting and reentering the game if you want to get them all making it a good game for you achievement hunters out there.Conclusion:No for anyone who wants this game for gameplay, I don't think it's worth it even for being so cheap because after one hour of grinding the achievements I still did not understand many features and I really think some instructions would have been nice.Yes for those who are buying this game on discount for trading cards , badge crafting, booster pack eligibility and achievement grinding, because there's a fair chance you could make a profit, and 1002 achievements and full completion of the game in 1 hour sure aren't too bad for achievement hunters, right?Sorry devs, as much as I love the emoticons, the memes put into this game, the amount of achievements, I have to go with a negative review because I find this game unfinished and I rate gameplay as a more important feature compared to achievement grinding."

,Not Recommended,422870,29073236,Posted: 6 January,all,Sinful Sorcerer,"To be frank, I don't know if I could even call this a game...I've seen Atari games with more complexity and depth than this. But of course complexity is not everything; simple games can be very enjoyable too as long as they have a nice concept and they are fun to play or let the player feel something special, be it through story or gameplay.This ""game"" however, didn't really make me feel anything but boredom nor can I remember having any fun playing it at all. Your objective is simply to hold down your right mouse button and capture as many people as possible. After a set time period the game ends and then repeats, again and again, endlessly, only each time with a slightly different background. The levels always have the same music, which although pleasant, gets extremely repetetive after a while. And as far as I'm aware, there are no sound effects either. In terms of hazards or dangers there don't actually seem to be any. Some ""enemies"" will shoot bolts of lightning at you or throw daggers up into the air, but from what I've found you can't actually die in this game, nor do you suffer any consequences from being hit other than the fact that you lose one gold coin each time. These gold coins are entirely pointless in terms of gameplay and their only purpose is to unlock some alternate character sprites, letting you change your UFO's appearance slightly.Sometimes crates spawn that give you powerups, but from what I can understand only some of them give you anything at all and there is only one powerup you can get; an upgrade which gives you three beams instead of one, making your job of beaming up people slightly quicker. The people themselves have different appearances, some are knights, others look like jawas from starwars, and a few resemble South Park characters or well known internet personalities such as Minecraft's founder Notch for instance. At the top of the screen the game tells you which characters it wants you to collect on each level and how many of each, however it seems it makes no difference whether you complete this task or not. My guess is you get a bit of exp which is how you level up and get this game's overabundance of achivements, but I can not confirm this as I after a while gave up after not seeing any difference and instead simply went around beaming up any and all people I came across. Sticking around the centre of the level and going from house to house beaming up anyone you see appears to be the fastest way to collecting the achivements, which is what I believe anyone who bought or will buy this game is here for to begin with.The game has a few different weapons you can use with the left mouse button, and you can choose between them at any time, however using weapons also seems pointless at the moment and I would instead recommend sticking to your beam as it is the quickest, and only way, I found of leveling up and earning the achivements.I understand this review might have been harsh, but my intention is not to insult the developer. It is simply to inform the supposed consumer to rethink your decision about purchasing this game, and perhaps rather stay away for the meantime. I do hope that the developer updates the game and adds it some depth because I do believe there could be something interesting here, eventually. But as for right now the game feels extremely devoid of purpose and I would rather refer to it as a Steam Achivement Grind simulator, than an actual game.I hope to be able to change my review in the future, but as for right now I do not recommend this game at all and I urge you to stay far away from it. I believe it is very much an unfinished product and should not have been released in this state. If you want to earn a ton of achivements quick (500 at the time of writing this) then sure, go for it, it's your money. But for anyone looking for a fun experience, this is probably not it."

Why not 300, or 350? Maybe the developer's birthday is on the 29th of March? Who knows?)(UPDATE: The number of achievements has been increased from 329 to 1002, which I noticed on 22 January 2017. This means that it takes a lot longer to get 100% of the achievements; it's still easy, but just a lot more tedious to accomplish.)After a while, the game becomes repetitive, so it doesn't have a high degree of replayability.For most people, it won't be a game you will want to return to over and over again.But, if you are after a bit of amusement, or if you are an achievement-hunter, or a completionist, then this is a good game to get.It's not brilliant, but the cartoonish nature of it makes it somewhat amusing.If the game was expensive, it would get a thumbs down.But, in context of it being a very cheap game, it's ok.You can get heaps of Steam achievements, and another ""100% game"" to add to your list, which is a bonus.It costs less than a dollar, so it's a cheap bit of fun you can play for a short while.#AchievementCrazy"

I only got it because it has a thousand achievements.There are some interesting game mechanics, like different weapons, a tractor beam, and a currency system. However, the only thing you need to use for the achievements is the tractor beam. This makes the game essentially a vacuum simulator in which you just need to abduct as many people as possible over and over and over AND OVER.There is no story and no levels. You just abduct people for 2 minutes at a time and keep repeating that. You can customize your spaceship for coins, which you get by abducting people in the game.The music is annoying and there are no settings to turn it off.Overall, I only recommend this game because for achievement hoarders and not for its replay value."

If you're an achievement hunter seeking to get all the achievements on games, look no further than this little number right here.

I've already completed the game with all the achievements, and it took me 23 minutes.

,Not Recommended,422870,32969225,Posted: 28 June,all,The Salt God | Best Engi Hats,"I got this game with a 75% discount, hoping that it would now be at least slightly worth it. However, it proved otherwise. It'sVERYlimited. It loops. Over and over again. There's no real feeling of progression. All the characters are the exact same, both in gameplay and how much they cost. The achievements: Why make me go though such pain and agony of playing this game just to get to level 1,000? Why? The level-upsDO NOTHING. They don't make the game easier/faster or even make the game change at all. That goes against what a level-up even is. And there's no losing this game. Yes, you have a time limit, but that just ends the ""stage"". You don't lose anything for not being fast enough, which means usually you've been doing nothing at doing the so-called objective.Now for the plot/purpose of this game. The story is that you're trying to take over the world. However, it doesn't go any further than that.And that story comes from the description from the Store Page! It's not actually in the game! In fact, it would be no different if it didn't have that storyline. Now to point out the purpose of this game: To be a meme game. Yes, I understand most meme games suck really badly. But, this one is not even fun. It doesn't capitalize on the fact Doge is in it except for the store page picture. The only memes in it are the characters, which again, have no differences from each other.Now for the reasoning for the title. So, why is genocide in the title? You are ""killing"" certain targets. Not everyone. That's not what genocide is. I'm going to guess that the only reason why it's in the title is because of the overrated game Undertale. Also, this game isn't ""Super Duper"" good. Now we're left with Flying 2017. If Doge were to play this game (if he wasn't a dog), he'd say ""such bad"".Don't buy this game. Don't get this game. Don't emulate it. It's not worth it. Even if it were to be free."
