If you normally play RTS games by turtling, this game is especially made for you.  Build up a series of defenses to hold off literal waves of enemies.  Once you get the hang of it, it is a good chill-out game."

This game doesnt really add anything on to that.  Really.  Unless you just want more....  As as side note most of the levvels in the current screenshots arent even in this.  Also many of the levels in the current video are not as well.  But i liked it anyway.
,Recommended,422910,29235195,Posted: 13 January,all,sbszine,"If you're reading reviews of this game you probably have a good idea of what it is. If you've played CW3 and are wondering whether the earlier games are worth playing, the answer is yes. CW1 is very minimal, but it really drills you on the basics (efficient use of collectors, blasters, mortars). There are no nullifiers or AC, so you have to be able to put out a lot of damage per second to clear the levels.If you're new to the series, start with Creeper World 3, then come back to this."
,Recommended,422910,32751205,Posted: 24 June,all,Dave.,"I bought number 3 on sale a couple years ago, never bothering to understand where the first 2 came from (or were, on the internet).  Then low and behold the Steam summer sale 2017 comes out, and I happen along this, and the 2nd game, which had now been released, to my enjoyment.  The one negative review on here says play the 3rd because it is better (which it is), and don't waste your time with the first 2, which has been out for free, in a browser version.  Needless to say, $2.49 later, I dropped the 3rd one, and began this one from scratch to play the series throughout.  Great game."
,Recommended,422910,29281687,Posted: 15 January,all,JoshuaJSlone,"I started with Creeper World 3 here on Steam, and liked it a lot. So when the Anniversary Editions of the older games showed up, I decided to check them out too. And on first impression... I was going to give this game a thumbs down. Not because it's bad, but because to almost every introduced thing I would think ""Oh, like in 3, but simpler or cruder."" Since 3 has a bajillion stages, why not just play more of that?But then I kept playing, enough to finish all the standard stages and get all the achievements, and it's still just too much fun to give a thumbs down. And having every single stage be exactly one full square screen of size is more different than bad, really. Standard price is also quite a bit cheaper, so maybe it's a good choice for your first step into the series.The Chronom is also a pretty cool feature. It procedurally generates a stage based on a given date. You can then try to be the first to win the stage based on your birth date, or set a new high score for the stage based on some notable date in history. As long as you've got the urge to play, you won't run out of targets."

This makes experimentation and optimization more efficient and enjoyable.  Sadly, in the original Creeper World, you can do neither.  Therefore experimentation is practically impossible and any mistake can be very costly.  This probably only matters if you are worried about efficiency and competing against other scores on the leaderboards.I have spent hours optimizing my strategy on a single map in Creeper World 3.  In Creeper World, I just cannot be bothered.So... I recommend and enjoy Creeper World 3 much more than Creeper World 1.  But if you are a completist, it is fun to see what came before Creeper World 3."
,Recommended,422910,28764924,"Posted: 28 December, 2016",all,Pathborn,"Fairly fun game, especially if you played Creeper World 3 and 2 and wanted to see where it started. But if you're interested in these games I actually recommend playing the third one first, as it's the best, and if you liked it, then checking out the first two. Compared to the latter two, the first one's quite primitive in story and gameplay. The characters have no names, for instance (except for one, near the end). No portrait art either.I mainly played the game to get some background story info on the masterpiece of the third game, but was somewhat disappointed to find it didn't even have that much background info; the story was very bare-bones. Obviously this game was made much earlier, when the developer was still learning to program games, so some roughness is to be expected. If you don't expect a lot, it's worth the price (even if you can play it for free elsewhere, with some minor differences).The one interesting thing about this game that the others don't have is its upgrade system. Unlike the others, you can't just upgrade whatever you want based on tech points or whatever, instead, you have only 6 possible upgrades, and you need to collect, on each level/map, upgrade tokens to use. Often maps don't have 6 tokens, so you need to prioritize which to spend them on. This can lead to some interesting gameplay, although in practise it's so simplistic that you almost always will just spend them on increased tower range and firing rate (those advantages are just too good to pass), and then spend the other tokens (if any) on the less attractive four options. But overall this system of upgrading is interesting and I hope it returns in Creeper World 4 or perhaps in other games by other developers."

If you like tower defense or puzzle games, or if your favorite technique in an RTS game is to turtle up and play defense, you'll like this game.If you've already played the flash-version, there's not much difference, beyond somewhat improved visuals and the ability to deselect units using RMB."

76561197993331220,Recommended,422910,28033307,"Posted: 29 November, 2016",all,BanditRingtail,"A nice revamp of the original Creeper World.  While it's still a little rough around the edges, and much slower than later games, this is the one that started it all.  I remember first playing the demos on Kongregate, doing my best to outsmart the Creeper and figure out the best strategy to activate the totems and escape to the next world.Is it the best game out there?  No, probably not.  But it definitely is one of the best indie games I've ever played, and I've no regrets in picking it up in the Steam Autumn Sale.  I might get bored with it in time, even with all the challenge maps and user created levels (not to mention the feature which creates a map based on the date you enter in!), but it'll last me a while yet.  And I've still got two more games to go through!  Three, if you count Particle Fleet.I definitely recommend giving this game a try.  I don't know of any other strategy game out there like it.  Fighting creeps and minions is one thing.  But fighting a literal flood of pure destruction?  I imagine if it hasn't been copied already, it's only because doing so would require more effort than most shovel-ware developers are willing to put in.Give it a try.  Be careful, though.  You might find it a bit addictive.  You just might see the sunrise for the first time in years!  (Unless you play Civilization a lot.  Then for you, it's Tuesday.)"

The only reason why I DON'T recommend it is because Creeper World 3 is much better.I used to play the free online versions of this game back in the day. Good stuff. Honestly though, unless you're getting it as part of the KnuckleCracker Collection bundle, go for CW3 instead.Go here for a nostalgia trip back to the aftermath of the first Creeper invasion, before there were nullifiers, shields, digitalis, spore towers, or CRPL; don't go here if you're experiencing Creeper World for the first time.Just like the other games, though, there's tons of user-made maps and a random map generator (based on dates) so at least you won't run out of content.

,Recommended,422910,27036183,"Posted: 23 November, 2016",all,Aurek Skyclimber - Pie,"This is easily my favorite RTS of all time.  You face an endless foe with no hope of survival.  All you can do is hold the enemy off long enough to escape.  Build collectors to gather energy from the ground around you, then use that energy to power the construction and operation of your customizable network of structures: energy creators, weapons, network modifiers, and more.  Use more energy than you have available, and your operations will slow to a crawl, potentially resulting in the loss of part of your outer line of defense and valuable energy resources if you don't catch it quick enough.  The futher you move through the cosmos, the more tricks the enemy will learn to use against you and the more the terrain will be designed to work against you.  Keep to the high ground, and best of luck!I've spent a ridiculous amount of time on the original releases of this game and its sequels, this one in particular.  Glad to see the first two games have finally made their way to Steam!"

76561198052388186,Recommended,422910,28918051,Posted: 1 January,all,Aglet Green,"This is the best Creeper World game ever made.  It is worth it at any price, but especially worth it now if you buy it during the Steam Winter Sale as you can get it the Anniversary Edition discount price or as part of the KnuckleCracker bundle.   It has nothing in common with CW2, but if you've played CW3 you will recognize all the units instantly.  You can get through the campaign in a long weekend; it has 20 maps.  However, where this game shines is the replayability function-- every single day-- every single day has a new map.  And you can go back and play old maps regardless of when you buy it, so if you want to play the map for July 4th, 1976, that's in here somewhere.  And you post your best time online to compare/compete with the best times of others.Gameplay:For those who has never played Creeper World, it's basically a Tower Offense game.  In every map you have a base called Odin City, and you have to build outward from there.  Instead of random monsters, the bad guy is watery, ocean-like 'Creeper' that keeps rising; you have mortars and drones to beat it back.  However, they cost energy and so you will also spend a great deal of time building energy farms and reactors, all of which always have to connect back to Odin City.The game is fun, exciting, and highly addictive.  Plus it's got a new visual upgrade for Steam so it looks far nicer than the original version.  Well worth getting!"

If so, you'll probably enjoy Creeper World: Anniversary Edition.  It's a simplistic version of the CW3 as it was the first CW game.  It has a total of around 40 levels which are pretty straight forward, but still fun nevertheless.  If you are experienced in the CW series, you'll probably get around 10-15 hours of out this game if you play on double speed.  For $4.99 or cheaper it's worth the money in my opinion."

,Recommended,422910,34872036,Posted: 10 September,all,Chaoticum,When I first played this game on Kongregate I hated it so much. What's the point of shooting water with blasters I thought. Then I found myself few hours later still in the game. And that's how it all started.As a reaction on some reviews. You should definitely play this first. Because of story. Because later games have some features you'd miss greatly here (e.g.nullifiers). And maybe because this one is the first.Creeper World is simple yet very complex game. You will love it or hate. Nothing in between.
