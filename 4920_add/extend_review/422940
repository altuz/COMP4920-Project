Because  came into this game as a SWG vet which was sold to me as the "" unoffical swg 2.0"" I really wanted to love this game and go back to my gaming home as I and many others have very fond memories of that time.This game takes those feelings and slaps them across your face there is barely anything put into the game.The biggest reason I can't recommend this game to anyone is the devs. Ethan will laugh and make fun of you in game and on the forums for asking for any help as well as his rude comments on the steam forums. I have been playing games a long time and in m many years I have never had to deal with a more rude and unprofessional dev. It truly makes me sad that such a game that had so much promise being ruined by buggy gameplay and rude devs.Do yourself a favor and pass on this one."

I wanted to like this game so much and I did, for a while, but at the current stage you won't enjoy this that much you would recommend this to anybody.My 44 hours of gameplay mostly was playing running simulator, clickfest when using a gadget to find resources and sight seeing an empty world. There are professions, I was artisan which is pretty much a must, because you can't buy stuff (at the moment that is), you have to make it yourself. Artisan needs resources to build stuff, and leveling artisan makes you able to craft better stuff. This is cool and if this works it would be awesome. I like things going slow and not too easy.Too bad it doesn't work. It's too difficult to find all resources you need and because you can't even buy them from npc trader, you spent your time running here and running there and start clickfesting in a hope to find the resource you need. Too boring, I'm out. I just couldn't find them, and after 44 hours I won't give a duck. Games should be fun, not working simulators.There are other professions, but when there is no other players or fauna to be found, I don't know how would you enjoy being a medic, a scout etc.I saw one npc trader, two shuttleports which I accidentally found while running. I saw no other players, I know there was 7 according to Steam Charts. I don't know how many plays non-Steam client.There is no map, no wiki, no tutorials. You should watch some youtube videos made by developer.And for some reason some stuff you make won't even work. I made few weapons, managed to load the magazines and tried to shoot in the air, nothing happened. WTF!!! Tried to imagine a scenario where the other player magically finds you and you can't even shoot him. Roflmao.You should read other reviews as well and visit the homepageWould I recommend at this stage = NObut, there is a promised huge patch coming (when, nobody knows, not even a year) which propably would change my vote to recommended."

I snapped it up, eager to hop in an see how it played.  Keep in mind this is a review on the first day of release.Divergent has a ton of potential and is clearly made with love, but it's early. It provides no direction for the beginner, the character creation is buggy (All characters vanish if you click a certain race and you have to restart)  Buildings vanish at certain angles, the only moving things were other newbs and one large mech.  Despite being a MASSIVE Swg fan I don't expect to play with the same level of graphics that I had back then either.  My character looks like she had some pretty bad plastic surgery after being run over by a herd of Bantha.Overall, Divergent is buggy and I didn't find it playable at all.  The price tag is high for the current content offered and I'd say it'll be worth giving a go in a few months, but not now."

Second off, nothing is really implemented in the game, besides endless material grinding. You look at the trailer, but half that stuff isn't even in the game, also pretty sure he doesn't have permission to use that song, but he doesn't care.Also just go check out the forums. The developer of this game (of which there are 2) does not take kindly to suggestions, or criticism. He will insult people, tell them how they are so wrong, and completely ignore their point. I've seen some childish devs before, but this guy might take the cake. Most people like when the devs are active in the community, this might be the exception where it'd be better if he wasn't.Also performance. This game brings my i7 to its knees.

It looks like SWG just because thats where the code came from. That is about the only similarities.This is more closely related to Mortal Online. FFA open world full loot pvp, do anything you want to anyone and its ok game rules. After many suggestions, discussions about PVP / PVE toggle, or consentual PVP, the topic was locked and NO matter what, the game is not going to consider PVE players.The map is huge and looks great, I walked around in the desert, for 4 days IRL looking for aluminum. Finally found some to have my harvesters destroyed as soon as I logged off by some asshat.

Game will never be finished as he openly admits on facebook he has no money to do so. So he released a new game that failed within the first week or so. Do not buy.
,Not Recommended,422940,22074716,"Posted: 26 March, 2016",all,Cinnax,"I understand that this game is early access. However, I am not sure WHY the dev decided to release at this point in time. This is game is in pre-pre-alpha at best. I may have an hour on this game, at best, simply because there is nothing. Here are things that make the game too frustrating to play at this time.- The UI is broken. Some of the UI textures do not fully render. That is, the elements seem like lattuce in that every few blocks of pixels are transparent or missing. It looks as though someone tried to print on a window screen.Also, it is very difficult to get the selection reticles to truly activate. It took me 10 or more attempts just to open my survey tool. And when I was able to click ""Use"", nothing happened. After a few more attempts it finally opened.- I didn't find a single resource to harvest the entire time I played. I spent the whole time surveying with no results. Surveying is very time consuming. You must navigate through the menu of resources to select a single resource to look for. I spent a lot of time simply running around looking for metal and polymer so I could try to craft a pair of pants.- There are no waypoints, no map or minimap, and no compass. You have to constantly type ""/loc"" in the chat window to get any sense of bearing. Someone told me a location to find polymer and it took me forever to get there because I had to keep stopping to find my location in chat just to see if I was heading in the right direction. Make sure you have pen and paper handy. You will need it to keep track of anything.- I did not see a single animal, creature, or moving thing other than a single player. Just a few empty buildings and abandoned harvesters.- It is early access, not even alpha ready and they want $120 to try things like voxel building. Also a $10 monthly sub for other benefits.- It will take you many many many hours to make any progress. Unless you are someone who can dedicated 40+ hours a  week to a single game, then this game might not be for you. I might be able to give 8 hours - 12 hours a week, so I don't forsee this as being a viable game for me.I really hope this game turns out and becomes something great. But at this time, it is not not ready for play. I would advise anyone looking to buy this game to wait at least a year to 18 months. Summer 2017 or New years 2018. Check in then to see if the game is ready."

Not promising for an MMO that has been available for sale for almost seven months.From what I gathered from the few players on, there is nothing really do do besides harvest and craft, and there is definitely no promise of persistance yet.This may be worth looking into in a couple years, maybe..   at the current development pace it will likely be even more than that before this can be considered any sort of real game, and who knows what corners will have been cut in the process."

Take that as you will.Avoid this for now, and likely in the futureWhat Divergence: OnlineISN'T:SWG 2.0- If you enjoyed pre-CU SWG and want to recapture that feeling, this is not the way.  The only thing this game shares with SWG are inventory/menu/interface graphic assets and class/skill design taken verbatim from SWG, with a few ""kewl"" additions to the classes and skills (don't worry, you'll notice them - they're the ones with typos and immature, out-of-context references such as ""1337 h4x0r"" and warhammer's ""psyker"")A playable game.Right now it is a walking simulator with crafting and sloppy, unvalidated structure placement.A stable experience.Hitching, texture popping, interface lag.A game with developers who care what you think.Feel free to read the developers comments in the Steam forums to get an idea what they think of both their custoemrs and their potential customers.   This will give you an idea how well the future development of this game is going to play out.What Divergence: OnlineIS:A lark.Seemingly the product of two friends who thought it would be cool to download the Unity (Personal) engine and make some quick cash.  Developer interactions with customers is rude, condescending, and dismissive.Unoriginal.Other than what you can buy in the unity store, the mechanics and interface are primarily oncepts and assets taken from SWG, 95% of which are not implemented yet.  The race and class content the developers have added themselves is seemingly a mish-mash of concepts from other games and IPs, added in a sloppy and juvenile manner which does not fit well with those from original SWG.Unlimited, open PVP.There is no faction system, notoriety, or flagging.   You can kill/be killed and looted by anyone, anytime, anywhere (except right next to spawn areas).  The developers show no intention of implementing any sort of consensual pvp systems and show verbal disdain on the forums towards anyone who suggests or advocates for those features in their PVP.Barely Tech Demo.After several years and several cycles of crowdfunding, the game is 90% feature-incomplete.A game of placeholders.The skill tree was taken directly from SWG's client, but almost none of it does anything yet."

I could get past all the re-hashed stuff if the devs were just upfront about it, but the way they have been presented it is more like a ruse to trick the community into thinking the game is farther along than it actually is. The creativity behind the game is amazing, but most of thoses ideas stayed ideas.I rarely go for refunds but I couldn't be a part of this.

The community around the game seems pretty good as well. The game DOES NOT HOLD YOUR HAND. To understand how to play it, you might have to watch some videos, in fact, I encourage you to do so.The game is very, very grindy, don't expect to do anything significant in your first 10hrs in the game, it took me (a noob) about 2 hours to make some pants. The game runs well almost always 60fps, but given time I think a busy server will change that. Divergence, in general, is unbelievably boring ( in MY opinion) I would say 80% of the time you're just standing still clicking buttons in the menu. Like I said, it's very grindy and very slow paced, and the 40 dollar price tag for an EA game at the stage it's at now is unreal. Which is why I can't recommend this game, some people may love it more power to you, but I do not.If you're curious about the game I did make a video on it, give it a watch if you want.

When attempting to troubleshoot the login issue, the developer himself was rude and unprofessional.With a game of this size, being developed for 2 years by what seems like only two coders and a lackluster amount of GMs, I don't believe they have the resources available to even field their early access subscribers. Considering the only response after a week of waiting, to have my issue not even fixed, is sarcasm whe asking honest questions and providing detailed responses.The following links are the discussion. I decided to save it for fear of the developer deleting it.Developer support discussionThe last disconcerting thing I heard, and I repeat, heard (NO ACTUAL PROOF), was when I was in the game's public teamspeak waiting to find a GM for help. One of the players of a large guild in game had received a bonus to his account, by the developer, because he posted a positive review. Again, no evidence, all I heard was the player bragging about it in the public teamspeak.Judging by all that has transpired, I say, stay far away from this game. This is a toxic environment and this will cause the game to fail.I will shortly be asking for a refund after this review has posted.EDIT: For this review I was banned from Divergence steam discussions and the conversation deleted. The developer obviously doesn't want feedback and doesn't wish to improve on his actions. All he had to do was delete the original account on the first day rather than waiting a week to respond and not dragging it out for hours after he finally did. Just view the time stamps in the images above and you will understand.EDIT2: Developer continues assaulting this review. If he ever deletes his comment, I will post the screenshot I took.

Drops a bit when entering populated cities (my cpu is a bottle neck in this case >.<)Negative aspects- feature incomplete (this is not unexpected-it is an EA after all!)- steam community/forums for the game semi-toxic- PvE - mobs are currently bugged out, and are to be fixedPoints to take note of:~ Recreated SWG assets. (not ripped from the game, but modeled after and used in the game)~ Similar skill system to SWG~ Real time, third person view combat.~ Mining/Crafting Similar to SWG~ Full PVP worldLong versionThis review on the game is based on having played the game after 54 or so hours based upon steam's estimation.I will start by saying that the term SWG 2.0 is a bit misleading.  Because to say this implies to me that this game and it's price tag are just a product of a few people trying to cash in on graphically prettier version of Star Wars Galaxies, and call it a day.   The more fitting term that I would go with, as coined by those who described Repopulation would be a, ""Spiritual successor"" to SWG.Now granted, the initial experience of the game resembles SWG, down to the familiar UI and clicking noises for typing.  This may lead to the impression t that this game tries to be SWG. What with a UI that is very similar to what you'd have seen in SWG, the skill trees, and even how some of the classes are named.   The next point of similarity is the mining and crafting system which seems to be almost lifted out of SWG, which is not a bad thing mind you because of the complexity that this mechanic afforded.  After harvesting/mining though it is pretty much at this point where the similarities end.The races are at this point are as follows. A little lizard race that weren't intended to be playable and yet ended up as such due to player demand (which in my opinion reminds me slightly of the Geico Gecko) . A robotic race (the synthetics) which lack the ability to use armor but rather instead are intended to focus around the ability to a) modify your body to provide you more armor upgrade stats, or b) allow you to transfer into a new body , whether it be into a larger combat mech, another synthetic chassis that was just built, or the fallen body of an enemy sythetic that was killed (or a friend who died o,O) while leaving the old body lying there.  Your typical human race which is composed of different sub types of human with different backstories and appearances (genetic lineages?).  The Lokri, another human looking race that look a bit differently and are more adept and ""psychic abilities"" which will have some advantages for the magic like abilities and skills available in the game.  (not yet implimented).  Another psionic based race called the D-Tanix that are going to be some sort of energy looking guys (not in game yet).  And finally you have the Veli which I would say are akin to space ninjas, and a PVP required, ""alpha race"" who pretty much have the ability to teleport, and slowly lose energy over time and who are required to kill on of their opposing faction (Vindicator kills Verrator, or Verrator kill Vindicator) to extend their life, which are purposely going to be made to be in low numbers.Combat, and healing are done in third person/over the shouldver view akin to games like Firefall, Definace, Day Z TPV, H1Z1 TPV, etc etc.  And is real time combat as opposed to the turn based combat seen in SWG.  Same goes for combat healing of other players which requires the use of a medic gun for healing others, or stim packs to heal yourself.Housing is pretty fun, and comes in the form of either house parts that you craft and plop down yourself, prefabbed housing, or housing that you build using a voxel tool, all of which are tied to a hopper.  In this game a hopper being a central terminal that you can use to tie all your items to in an area which can then be packed up and moved with little issue if you want to find a new spot.PvE at the moment is broken with the presence of a few of the planned mobs in the game with an AI and attributes that does require  tweaking if you want to avoid a horrible death.  More mobs to be added once these issues are fixed.As far as work being done, it must be said that this game is far from feature complete and is most definitely a game you could call an ""Early Access"" title, despite the fact that the game the main guys working on this project started according to some sources as far back as 2012-2013?   Despite this fact, it's not unusual to see the content constantly being updated and nearly daily patches in an attempt to work towards bringing the game towards a more complete state. With an emphasis on *more* given that an MMO is truly never complete given the addition and tweaking of content as time goes on.The community is a mixed bag as you may have seen on the forums, or even in the reviews, or on the reddit page.  The forums seem to be more toxic in the way of community with people on both ends spewing vitriol at one another.  Whilst in game, things are a lot more sociable in my opinion especially for a PVP enabled world.  This being that as opposed to having players only interested in killing other players (you do have quite a few of those), you have those players more interested in working with each other to build things up and who just wish to craft, mine, and socialize.  Add to this, active staff who are on nearly at all times who are always happy to socialize and talk, and who jump in to make sure that nothing which has broken stays broken.The game's graphics are quite nice looking,but  the client itself does appear to suffer from lack of optimization.  An issue most noticeable with the Nvidia cards.  (Using a 980TI here, and having some performance issues, whilst better performance is being reported with those using ATI cards). As of this review a patch was done adding the ability to turn on and off some of the visual effects, I've yet to find out if this affects the game's performance in any way at this time.Another issue that I want to bring up is the use of assets.  This has been mentioned and will probably continue to be a bone of contention for some.  As it is now, the assets are *not* ripped from the SWG client or from SWG Emu.  They are in fact modeled after these SWG assets at a higher poly-count, and skinned from scratch.  And quite honestly, in my opinion (for whatever it is worth) I feel that it was a good choice, because the harvesters, and the assets used in the game fit in with the world/terrain.All in all, as you can see by the time I put into this game, I am still continuing to enjoy it and if things keep progressing as they are, it is one that I will hope to enjoy for years to come.*edit* Updated review because client is far more optimized than when I wrote the initial review."

Divergence Online and SGL are trying to recreate one of the most advanced MMO's of all time..  Anyone that has play SWG knows how much resources was actually in that game to try and re create..  Currently the devs are dropping patch's left and right, sometimes 2 a day..  Coming from games like 7D2D, getting a patch maybe every couple months if that..  Not to mention no one from the Fun Pimps has ever, spent time in game with me shooting the♥♥♥♥♥♥and exploring around as I have with Ethan..  Most people that have problems with Ethan, have no sense of humor and are obviously taking♥♥♥♥♥♥way to seriously..  To be honest he is a really down to earth dev, but if you come off like a troll or someone fresh from WoW asking stupid questions because the only MMO youve played your whole life is WoW clones and dumbed down versions that literally hold your hand all the way to max level on your quest for Epic Loots..  Then DO is most likely not your game, this game forces you to interact with other players to try and survive, the same way SWG forced you to interact with other players to make a living or even function on effective level..That said, the current state of this game is very playable..  They have a good portion of Artisan complete allowing to craft and survey a vast range of structures/harvesters/weapons/armor and survey for all materials you will need to build these things..  Currency has just been added adding yet another SWG inspired element to the game, have to pay for your buildings and harvesters etc upkeep.  Medic has a bit of work done to it allowing you to craft meds and also heal yourself and other people..  There is still a ton of work that does need to be done on Scout but they do have some basic functions at this time like building log homes and setting up a campfire, it has been announced they do plan to add more soon!!  Marksmen and Brawler are implemented but dont have any skills yet that come with them, and you can only level unarmed at this point for brawler..  Sounds as tho even some elite professions like Architect are going to make there way into the game soon as well..So all and all currently you have a open world pvp third person shooter with full loot and tons of crafting options..  Everything in the world that is crafted and collected by players is lootable/destroyable by other players, this game is pretty cutthroat and I think that is bad♥♥♥♥♥.  Like the old Jedi grind when they had perma-death..  If you are looking for a game that throws content at you and holds your hand all the way through the game then I would not recommend this game for you, but if you want to be apart of what could be the best game of all time then I highly recommend you support this game.  The more support SGL gets the more this game become a reality, if everyone just sits there and goes oh lets just wait to see if this game launches.. Then it might never will..  Come be apart of the future in MMO gaming and join our community today!!  SEEYA ON ROOK!"

Can't wait to see where the development of this game goes!It's fair to say there is a lot still to do but there is plently of stuff implimented! Worth supporting in my view.**UPDATE 2** I've updated to a 'Buy' again.. please read below:So, if you are really serious about supporting the development of a truely free roaming sandbox game then I recomend you stump up the money and help out by getting stuck in. However even this might leave you a little frustrated at the moment as there aren't any road maps or dev logs to see what is being worked on. Having said that the main developer 'Ethen' is constantly in game and working hard on stuff like NPC's new crafting stuff etc. The game feels like SWG day 1, completely free roaming and sandbox, all items are unique and can be dropped in the world so have a 3d model. The scenery is lovely and varied and you can walk for hours and hours across current land mass (others being added).I belive the game has HUGE potential but the dev team needs to work quickly to get some basics in place e.g. groups, maps, trading, professions, private messaging, and some story/quest content. From on old SWG explorer and resource gatherer point of view Divergence is everything you want it to be but that's only going to last so long without the other elements of a sandbox mmo. It could also use a combat flag option even though I have to say I am finding the risk element of potentially getting killed and my inventory looted quick exciting !It's got a long way to go but maybe it can succeed where others have failed, the dev approach is unorthodox but maybe that's what's needed, less corporate 'Build a game to make money' and a bit more 'build a game that is someone's passion'......let me know if you want more details :)**UPDATE 1**I still recomend this game however.... DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME if you can not deal with constant PvP deaths and the risk of losing all you have collected in your inventory. Currently there are no banks and no really safe ways to protect the resources you have collect. So if you get frustated by others killing you for your stuff or simpy killing you (you body is almost impossible to find so you lose your stuff anyway) wait until a few more game mechanics are implimented."

I began walking out of spawn and I was greeted by a small little lizard called Loky. He promised me fame and fortune as long as I helped him kill all humans so I did what any rational robot would do. I terminated him with 30-40 punches and went on my quest. After spending what seemed 1 hour in-game (Was actually 5 hours) I figured out everything basic like how to Survey, Sample, Craft, Not to drag item past inventory screen (Because said item will be lost to the void and take up inventory space), Not dropping medium power cells (Because you won't be able to pick them up) and to prone in bushes to avoid the suicidal human death hunts and the kill bots roaming the land. At the end of the day I have 5 personal harvesters and I'm bush hopping. I haven't died yet and I've killed about 9 humans so far. With just 1 working skill in-game I've put 8+ hours and I haven't even gotten to base building yet! So try the game out. The UI and controls are CLUNKY. But the game has TONS of potential. Its swaying in the right direction. It could become your next favorite game. Only time will tell and if you want to see the development progress and the drama you should definitely pick it up.

OK enough ranting about morons and there crappy reviews.My review is as follows:Crafting in game is amazing, and extremely dumbed down right now, what i mean by that is you only need basic stuff to craft high end items, I believe this will change in future.Game World is absolutely stunning, i cannot believe the amount of detail, even if its unfinished, it look like a highly polished product if you can see past the minor code in work stuff happening.Movement and mechanics are working well but i think a few things could be done to place items in world, the camera seems too close for my personal taste but i was able to make it work within 15 minutes of loggin on the first time, then i got killed lol which leads me to next review.Open world PVP, hell yeah, ♥♥♥♥ing amazing bring it on ♥♥♥♥ing crybabies, I am a girl and i will kill you if you start something thats all I am going to say!Vendors and currency, i have not experienced the vendors yet or the monies (lol) but i will get there, I am understanding the only way to get credits is going to be going to these vendors and getting credits and or buying other peoples stuff, neat concept, but I personally believe this will change just by reading some of the dev notes and updates.So amazing, look at this I have played the game under an hour and have given a review of what i believe the game is right now, i read up on the forums before purchasing, read every single review and posted my honest opinion, please stop the bashing because you cant do this or that because you want to the game is an open world pvp sandbox, you dont like it go away and let the ones who have been waiting for a game like this to come out for years...."

,Recommended,422940,20445075,"Posted: 10 January, 2016",all,BOOM HEADSHOT,"Let me first start by explaining much of the negative feedback I've seen. If you notice, much of the negative feedback comes from players who spent far less than an hour even playing the game. Why does that make the negative reviews unreliable? Because you can't even delve into the game at that point. Chances are those players aren't the archetype required for a Sandbox MMO, and would quit in the first 30 mins of playing a game like EvE Online. They're used to having their hand held through games with maps and directions, and seldom read anything. This game will route out those players fast, but it will reward players who want to experience a true Sandbox, where you make the rules, and you dictate the communties' actions.  So here's a quality review: This game in its infancy has some really nice elements. The crafting tool is great, and starting from scratch makes you humble in the sense that you have to watch your back as you establish XP in your professions. Combat, when you get to that point, feels fluid. However, there are many bugs that can turn away new players, but if you read - it isn't the final product. These guys need backing. I do sometimes feel that combat is seriously out-done by the amount of grinding you have to do when surveying and gathering materials, It sometimes feels like the resources themselves are very far spread out, you will spend a lot of time walking to find the right areas, and even more time clicking ""get sample"" for a small amount of XP and resource gain. So far that's about 80% of my gameplay. When you do get your first gun, things start getting more spicy. The game needs a good grouping social tool, and some of the crafting and combat bugs can get frustrating, but that's all to be expected within the first weeks of release. The best part, is that the GMs are right there in the game with you, and are willing to talk to you in their Teamspeak. They do, however, encourage you to read the attached guides before asking them questions about how the game works, because the more time they spend explaining how to play the game, the less time theyre focused on server concerns. All in all, I think this has great potential, and thankfully there is a developer out there that knows what a sandbox is all about. If you want your hand held, this game will not be for you.

I really enjoy it and feel like everyone who's looking for a game that resembles Star Wars Galaxies should definitely give this a shot.I think the skill system is on point and I like the slow progression that it presents to the players. It's a game that takes dedication and planning on how you want your character to be build due to the limited number of skill points you get in order to level up skills available in different profession trees.Also, the surveying and crafting system is amazing. There are a couple of problems here and there with the menus bugging out periodically, but its Alpha. The PvP combat is also very good as well and I like the way the gun system works. I am hoping to see more weapons in the future and can't wait for the mechs to be released into the game.The graphics are also very well done, and look good even on the lowest settings which really surprised me. As of right now the options menu isn't really that filled with choices of things to mess with, but of course that will also change in the future so it isn't that bad of a thing.I think the only thing I really did wish was present in the current state of the game was npcs so training professions involving weapons would be easier to level due to pvp being the only way right now to do that at all.In the end, this game is amazing and if your anywhere near the fence on playing this game or thinking about it at all just go for it.

However, i simply asked in game if theres any advice someone can give a noob and i received plenty of help from other players and mainly the Dev himself who always seems to be online! (or at least a GM). There is now a player guide here on steam to help get you started and some youtube tutorials, i strongly recommend you give them a quick look before leaping in!Once you're past the learning curve and come to learn the controls it becomes apparent that this is a world full of potential, you can envisage the NPC's, player built settlements, vehicles, guilds and all the other professions coming into play. But in it's current state Crafting is really the only option open to us, so if you're looking for a MMORPG where you can dance in a cantina for money, or skin animals for hide then check back on this game in a few months and see whats going on. But if you like the Artisan route it's a good laugh mining for resources, building bases and seeing the results of your labours (if you handle the grind), plenty of people always seem up for teaming together to try and build a home of epic proportions.This leads me to the community of the game, so far from the people i've met and interacted with i've found a solid base here. No doubt you'll always gets ""those few"" on games that seem like their only purpose in life is to troll but so far everyone seems helpful and reasonably friendly...  PvP is currently on with no opting out!, so at any time you could be shot or punched, which is worrying sometimes!. But so far i've had ZERO firefights, everyone i've met seems to wanna trade or team up to explore the world.I've had no problems running this at all with 60 fps and the one week i've been playing i've seen plenty of updates fixing bugs, unlocking new items and skills. To watch a game being worked on as you play it is awesome! (in my humble opinion at least)As with any Alpha game, it's a work in progress!. So if you want a fully polished, bug free, complete game with all the trimmings then please wait until release and never buy any alpha!!. Because it is an Alpha i can be forgiving for the lack of beasts to hunt and wildlife in the world, there are many many features yet to be implemented into Divergence but i have complete faith this project will come to full fruition as i see it being worked on everyday i play, and from an outsiders point of view i see very passionate people behind it who want nothing more than to make a fun game that takes the crafting and complexity of SWG and turning it into something new.I can't wait to watch this game grow and evolve over time!!"

Understand this is an Alpha game in rapid development due to the support from steam users, with open all loot pvp and continued SWG assets from the now abandoned ware Star Wars Galaxies mmo. Thats all that really needs to be said, expect patches regularly and a dev who's working his♥♥♥♥♥off to fix bugs as they show up, and Remeber it's Alpha Status.Keep at it Ethan, and the team in general."

THE PLAYER THAT THIS GAME IS AIMED FOR IS ONE THAT WANTS A CHALLENGE NOT JUST A STEP BY STEP WALKTHROUGH THAT WORLD OF WARCRAFT is.After that i love this game i was taken aback by the complex crafting system and with very little information on the game there  new challange to tackle around every corner.I am the Great Emperor Floky First of the Ennie who is waiting hungly for new places to explore and new stuff to discover if u deside to play join the games ts and know that even if the community is small the fun is endless.A new faction is starting witch aims to help protect the newbie area so that new players can learn the game relatively grief free.

It has some similarities ON PURPOSE, you jack hole. SWG was a great game that was systematically destroyed by the stupidity of developers.But, you won't allow a company to take [take = develop from scratch similar assets to SWG] what rocked from SWG and make it better so that we can play a game that has the good points from SWG and improve the  whole system into a MMO that we've never experienced before.What is wrong with you? This is early access, there are similar things to SWG ON PURPOSE, be cause SWG ROCKED!"

You look at your hands, you're trembling, the sound of gunshots in the distance give you the impression that you probably didn't arrive in paradise.This is the world of Rook, and the essence it captures seems unforgivable at first.Divergence Online is definitely what  could be described as a ""true sandbox"". Your role as a  player, whether you may be Ennie, Terran, or Synthetic, is what defines the experience for not only you, but the rest of the community.Here are some highlights that have helped me come to this conclusion.Voxel based building brings the opportunity to create custom structures anywhere.Destructible environments and open pvp make diplomacy important, but not necessary.Crafting is complex, the quality of your materials determine the quality of your product, no more cookie cutter stats.All of these factors have made this game incredibly immersive.I would recommend this game to someone who would like to become a part of the foundation of this completely player-run universe by playing Early Access."

Yes some people are upset about the Devs. Yes some people are upset there is a lack of direction spoon fed to you upon start. (Very helpful steam guide and youtube videos 1 click away) Yes it is very early access. But I'm still excited by this game. Huge world. It's not Star Wars but has a very SWG feel. Plenty of fun to be had right now and more evry day as they are rolling out the updates. I am more than happy that I put 30 dollars towards a game that is moving towards something I would love to see as a finished product.Devs keep up the good work.

This one seems a lot more fleshedout and polished which is probably because it was first. It took me a bit to find the in game guides but that may be because I didn't know what to look for but once I did it wasn't as hard to figure out as I had heard before. I feel like the thing it has going against it was being called an MMO because I didn't run into hardly any players but if I didn't expect players I would have thought it was a very good single player RPG instead. Regardless I have seen some goodlooking unity games before but this was by far the most beautiful ever. I'll be doing more exploring and checking back to see what's changed again for sure.

I played swg back when it launched in beta and i played until the server closed.  Now when i think about how that game was when it launch compare to this game i think this game has done an AWESOME job.  first i wanna say the game isn't finish but  progression it has made from lauch of earily access until now is Good. I think it's good that games do this and let you play so you can give feedback positive helpful feed back. alot of people say they did not like the change from pre-cu  well if you like the challenge of pre-cu then then try it before the pre-cu is done for a challenge.  Remember people  challenge does not mean easy just saying

That being said, this game has the old SWG foundation, so it is miles above other MMOs the way it is right now! I have been in game since I got it downloaded... played for about an hour while watching the videos from Eathan and decieded to sub right then. The two guys trying to pull this off are not looking to get rich, IMHO, they miss the real MMOs of old.. not these WOW clones. So download the game and see if you like it... if you do sub up and join me. P.S. it is a sandbox, no easy classes here!!"
