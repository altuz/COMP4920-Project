Instead of studying for actual finals, I played an interactive novel where my character *ahem* negotiates for a higher grade and bombs another class on moral principles. I couldn't have asked for a better time.(+) Most importantly, the novel is well-written. As in, amazingly well-written. If this novel was published and in a bookstore, I'd scoop the novel up for $20.(+) Fun and inventive characters. It was impossible to choose a favorite, but Tress is a L'Oréal goddess.(+) Lots of character customization. My costume was a hot mess. Also, I love the inclusiveness with options for ""asexual"" and ""non-binary gender.""(+) Lots of romance options. Hey Mob ;)(+) Did I mention this game is well-written?(-) The story isn't complete. You'll have to wait for Part Two, but good things come to those who eat their vegetables.(EDIT: This doesn't mean that the game isn't ""unfinished."" This is the start of a trilogy and there's enough material in Part One to whet your appetite until Part Two is released. The ending is doesn't feel rushed or ends abruptly.)I cannot wait to see what happens in Part Two. There are so many unanswered questions! The spoiler contains a semi-spoilerific open-ended question for the author/anyone who wants to answer.My character wished he had super strength as a kid, so when I knew about Mob's ability, I knew that was the RO for my character. However, there was one line that intrigued me. This line was around Downfall's final exam. Mob mentioned that he felt unusually stronger around the classmates and faculty, so is it possible that my character develops super strength despite not being a Z-Person? Or is it because of Downfall revealing her abilities? Or something else entirely? Who knows?10/10 Would accidentally rename myself as Captain Powerless again"

76561198035756561,Recommended,423120,19686268,"Posted: 13 December, 2015",all,amcjkelly,"I love the game.   The subject matter is something I am really interested in (Heroes and comics) and given how badly most comics are written these days (new 52,,, yuck) this is a breath of fresh air.    This is like the movie Sky High, which I also loved (wish they had made a sequel) I have logged a lot of hours trying to get all of the   sub plots (and trying to pick which one will be my starting point for the next installment).Be advised, this game is exactly what it says.   Text based, with only a few images at the start and no music.  Other than that, it is a lot like Long Live the Queen and Magic Diary.    I am impressed with how much dialog is included, it is like a Choose Your Own Adventure ... novel.   I think it (by in large) avoids the pit falls of the Choose your Own Adventure books,  if you really think about the choices and the characters... the responses make sense.   For the cost... it is a real steal.I recently got a little burned following Life Is Strange, but I think the developer of this game will come through with a lot of endings at the end that will please everyone.   I think the problem with Life is Strange is that producing a bunch of endings when you have voice talent, music, and graphical images, and a lot of overhead,  is very difficult.   I have really high hopes that in the end of this game, if you make the right choices, some endings may actually be very rewarding.  I wish it had a few more images, for key plot twists... but it is still fun to use your imagination."

Maybe not on the parents side, but this is the closest I've felt to losing a loved one in my life so far. I can not recommend this enough. I'm still crying from all the mistakes I made. I made all my choices carefully, I was cautious and I still ♥♥♥♥ed up.""You can not change the past but you can work towards the future""This story single handedly changed me from a wise-cracking detective with a heart of gold simply looking for love with apaper girl called Origamiinto a hateful, spiteful, Batman-like figure hellbent on revenge. And on a level of real emotions and passion, these choices were made with those in mind. I feel this pain, I'm griefing the losses and my mistakes and I just know, when part 2 comes out, I'm going to make many more terrible choices in anger and grief. Here's looking at youCrook. We'll ♥♥♥♥ Manipulator up, screw everything else.Here's where I'll take someone elses review format (griffit8 to be precise) and put in my own opinions.Pros(+)It is EXTREMELY well written. Very long if you consider the amount of hours you'll get out of it with a quite bountiful study system and skill variety that quite clearly affect the outcome of your actions.Protip, don't try to be a jack of all trades or you're gonna have a bad time. You know what, do do that, it's a part of the experience to play as yourself.(+)All of the characters are extremely memorable and unique archetypes.The best part is your choices of what you say will generally always coincide with their personalities and elicit a response in regard. The great thing about this is you will actually make friends and '?a love interest?' to match your personality.(+)The character customization is nice and is done over quite a few pages and kinda never really ends as you evolve tiny amounts throughout the story.(+)So much romance, so little time. I ended up alone, simply for making the wrong choices no matter how right they seemed, but it never felt detached and it always flowed perfectly.(+)The Price is amazing for such a well developed story. I would easily pay $15 for this.Cons(-)I would also mention the story being incomplete but as mentioned, it is a trilogy with part 2 currently being worked on. I love this story and can't wait, but 2017 is a big wait at this point.(-)This isn't really a con of the game, just a con in general because you made me really sad with the ending I got, BOO HOO!Final ThoughtsIf I haven't already said it a hundred million times. If you love a good story, like to read, like to choose your own adventure, love plenty of choice options, a bit of romance and making plenty of terrible choices that will affect and reverberate the entire outcome of the world around you then getting this is a no-brainer!For the Developer/AuthorIf you do read this, I would really appreciate a text document of all the characters personalites and appearances presented in the story. I'd go through it myself but I can't bring myself to read the story again at this moment, I'm still really shaken up.I'd like to use them for reference for some fanart I'd love to do. Consider me a part of this universes fandom! A self-insert addition would also be my wise-cracking, cautious but do all you can for your friends even at the cost of your life, studious but terrible at physical activities detective in a trenchcoat, Dusk, I really feel like he was a part of the story too."

Honestly, it took me half the first playthrough to get what was happening. I cannot wait for the next installments.Also, I never play these types of games, but the idea of a community college choice oriented super hero game attracted me to this game. If you are debating getting this game because you are interested, give it a shot, it's worth it.I'll also say this, some decisions you make do not change the outcome of specific events, but there are choices that influence the majority of game play. I hated my first gameplay and I played again with a new idea behind my super hero and did a 180 flip with my character and he's at a place where my first character was not even REMOTELY close to. It's very reminiscent of those old novels that you would make a choice and go to ""page ___ to continue.""TL;DR: It's fun. Don't deny it because its text based. It isn't completed, its a series similar to most episodic video games. Give it a shot, it's cheap, worth the money, go for it!"

But this story just isn't at the same level of quality as others that Choice Of Games has released. I understand that this is under the Hosted Games label, but it's not even close. I own almost all of the COG games on steam, and this is the only one that has regularly made my choices feel forced and meaningless. This is also the only story that has regularly failed to provide me with the choice that I thought was the correct decision for the situation.Things you need to know:- Part of a planned trilogy. Nowhere on the store page does it say this.- Incomplete story (Not even the story arc in this chapter is fully resolved and nothing is really wrapped up. It just...)- Inconsistent quality. (Some spelling and grammar mistakes. Most of the problems are strange writing problems like scenes that are out of order or contradict things stated in previous paragraphs in the same scene.)- Several choices require knowledge from previous plays to make the ""right"" choice.- Many choices have unclear consequences."

The fact is I have been waiting on a sequel for this game for over a year now. It's a little disapointing to not see a follow up for this game. However were not here to talk about seqeuls, Lets focus in on the game at hand. This is a very imaginitive game almost like a well crafted novel with important choices to make involved. If you are not up for a lot of reading and no graphical representation of whats going on then this is NOT for you. For those that have an imagination and are willing to do some reading this game i would highly recommend.

It's the first part in a series of who knows how many installments.There seems to be this intricate system in place of tracking how well liked you are, what your stats are, what your equipment is... It doesn't matter one bit. It's just fluff and doesn't do anything. Maybe it does in the sequels but for now it doesn't and that's all that matters.I guess if you're a fan of these developers, then you'll like this. It was my first experience with these guys and I'm not impressed at all.To give you an idea: imagine a school kind of like Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. Add in a Harry Potter-esque atmosphere, except with some adult themes and fanfic tier plotbuilding. At least the grammar seemed alright. And then at the end of this flaccid ride, it just ends. There's not even a big cliffhanger, it just stops."

It is as bare bones as it gets, plain old text but the storytelling, the characters, the atmospheric immersion of reading and the fact that your choices matter (up to a certain point) will make up for a surpisingly dark yet at times funny story which unravels as you click on the choices appearing of the screen. I can honestly say that I've spent significantly more time trying to decide for an otherwise simple choice in this game than any of AAA games of a similiar fashion.I have to admit that the entire premise of the game is reminiscent of the 1999 cult classic movieMystery Men, in addition from getting vibes from the now defunct MMOCity of Heroesand the same time feel like this could actually be a lostCommunityepisode. There's a near perfect mixture of seriousness, humour and meta humour, dark and mysterious twists and reveals, romance, resource management, entertainment, social issues, you name it. It is up to you to choose your own path and explore this fascinating world the author has created.There's a cliffhanger ending however there are supposed to be episodic sequels (like comic book issues) upcoming for the game as the author has mentioned, but even at its current state and current price, this is a brilliant take on the choose-your-own-adventure genre in a video game format. Definitely recommended."

A checkpoint system would be excellent for redoing chapters or single choices instead of replaying the entire game up to the point in question. At the very least, there should be an unlockable checkpoint system otherwise you end up clicking through the game without reading and tend to miss points or other choices.- The stats in this game are ridiculously confusing. The stats for your character have words like ""pow"" and ""woosh"" each signifying strengths and public image. Additionally, there is another stat menu showing four character traits.  Because of their confusing nature I never used them and ended up making choices through trial and error.As for all text choice games on steam, this game is text only. No music or images. If that deters you I would play the demo for free on steam and make the decision from there on. Personally, I don't find the $4 price tag too much considering how well made and enjoyable this game was. If you do find it pricey, you can always wait till a sale.Excited to see how the rest of the story plays out.8/10"

,Not Recommended,423120,19808435,"Posted: 20 December, 2015",all,ChristmasLlama,"This review contains spoilers. Major spoilers. My overall impression of the game is negative. While I do like the world they have created, everything else about this game is, in my opinion, pretty sub-par. On a site where the other CYOA games are much more well written and flat-out better than this game, i'm surprised by the amount of positive reception this has recieved. Maybe it just knows its audience. I mean on the offical thread for this game, people were talking less about the quality of the writing and more about how to romance Stoic. It should give you a rough idea of who this CYOA game is for.Story and charactersThe story doesn't really go anywhere. The only major plot point is the contrarian, but we know just as much about her at the beginning as we do at the end. She shows up, blows up a few things and leaves, leaving the characters just as confused, and essentially in the same place as they were at the beginning of the game. The school closes down and they have to study in a field somewhere which is interesting, but it's reopened again by the end of the game anyway which makes the whole ""leaving the school"" thing entirely redundant. In fact, most of the plot doesn't really go anywhere. The only real difference between the beginning and end of the game is the fact that Origami dies (a character who was fun, but with very little depth), Nil leaves and is replaced (a character who's entire purpose is to be mysterious) and Stunner leaving for Prestige. Everything else is the same. Speaking of characters, every character is a one dimentional caricature of a human being. The most interesting thing about them are the secrets that the game keeps hyping up, but I always just felt the game was just shortchanging me by making me fight for even a slither of character development that the secrets provide. They are things that really only work if there are other things that make your characters more interesting. But the secrets were it. I wouldn't disagree with people saying it is written like a fanfiction.Bad stat screenI have no idea what any of the numbers mean, and some of the stats just make no sense. The personality ones for example. They're all percentages but I have no idea what the percentages mean. Are they meant to represent the percentage that your personality is that trait? If so, why don't all the percentages add up to 100%? What about the relationship screen, what's that about? The game just assigns a random value on each character, but what does this value even mean? It goes higher when I kiss peoples asses but I don't get what the numbers for. It was even more confusing when i saw that the hidonist was -2 for me. So is our relationships so bad now that he's repulsed by me? I don't know, he isn't really treating me any differently. The stat screen for your skills aren't much better. They use onomatopoeia in order to represent the different skills. For example, strength would be ""pow"" on the stat screen, speed would be ""whoosh"" and so on. It was cute for the first ten minutes of the game, before you realised those stats are incredibly important and you'll probably be looking at them the most in the game. In which case you are soon left frustrated as you keep needing to look back at the ""Explanation of Stats"" at the bottom of the page.Combat system is awfulI have no idea what choices uses what skills, which means most of the time I'm just guessing what to do in combat, which usually leads to me losing. Does charging use the strength skill or the speed skill? Is it both? Maybe its defensive but I have no clue, the game doesn't tell me. Even things like punches and kicks, one time the game refers to a punch as a ""quick punch"". Am I supposed to infer that means it uses the speed skill rather than strength? Did punching ever use the strength skill? I assume it does but the game gives me no feedback. Do the numbers attached to the skills even have any bearings on the outcome of the fight? I have no clue. This is made even worse by the fact that there is no way to revert back to the beginning of a chapter or whatever. If you screw up, you have to play the whole game again.Annoying non-choicesThey are there solely to give the illusion to the player that they have more choice than they actually have. Some of these come disguised as legitimate choice options that reveal their true nature after you select something, the game explaining it away usually with a character shutting you up before you get to say anything or someone attacking you before you get to make a move. These are annoying but they don't happen too often. However, most come in the form of painfully contrived questions directed at the player asking you about how you feel about something. Things like ""How do you feel about Prestige?"", ""What is your opinion on the Hidonist?"", ""Do you regret going to the slumber party?"" and so on are so common in this game. My personal favourite asks you something along the lines of ""What do you think Tress is going to say?"" Really? In a true CYOA, the game would actually LET me choose what she is going to say, or at the very least, it wouldn't feel like it needs to ask those sorts of questions because there would be plenty of other choices in the game. This game seems desperate for actual choices, which leads me to my next point.It shouldn't be a CYOA, it should be a bookThis is one of those CYOA games that don't play at all to the strengths of the medium. It's so caught up in telling its own story that it forgets that it's meant to be a choose your own adventure, I mean it's the name of the genre for gods sake! Do you know how much better it would be if instead of the game shamelessly forcing you to interact with certain characters, you got to choose? I mean I guess it did that when you got to decide what things you wanted to study, but I never did that for the characters, I did it to get my skills up. There are scenarios where if you don't do what the game wants you to do, you are punished by being stripped of content altogether rather than given an alternate route. My go to for this argument is at the beginning of the game, where if you p*ss off Tress (aka easily the most annoying character in the game) and Stunner (aka D**chebag McDudebro) by losing the capture the flag match or leaving a bad impression on Tress, you don't get to talk to them outside of school in that issue. At all. Instead of being given alternate ways of interacting with the characters, Tress just flat-out blanks you at the supermarket and you don't run in to Stunner at all. This is a problem that is a lot bigger in the grand scheme of things. At the end of the game, you get to choose whether to run to be the team leader. If you choose to do so, each member of your team will vote for either you or Tress to be leader. On my ""technically"" third playthrough, I lost. I was confused because while I wasn't getting top grades, I still thought I was more compitent than Tress was. So I searched through the COG forums and realised that the only way people will vote for you is if their arbitrary relationship number was high enough. This immediately makes one of the most subjective things about the game (who you interact with and who you talk to) completely objective, where you are screwed over if you don't talk and build a relationship with the right people from the start.Overall, pretty bad IMO. Get Tin Star. Or something else other than this.EDIT: Grammar and formatting"

Some of the characters are interesting (the most intriguing aspect of the game is trying to find out each student's secret) and the game definitely has its moments, but writing is a bit ham-handed and there were two major issues that greatly reduced the enjoyability for me:- The plot is strictly rail-roaded. There are several occasions where you are offered various choices, only to see the game tell you that what you chose was not possible after all and some of the choices you did not pick occurred instead. There are several odd non-choices, where you are just asked to select an opinion that has no effect on anything. And the worst bit: none of the choices you make actually affect the course of the main story;.basically your choices only affect which relationships and skills are advanced, there are no multiple possible storylines. All these shortcomings are in direct contrast to what I'd expect from a quality multiple-choice game.- This does not feel llike a complete independent game. You start developing a character and following his/her story, but in the end everything is just left hanging in the air and you get an advertisement for the sequel – you are told merely the opening chapters here. In my opinion this should definitely be marketed as part 1 of <n>, so that it would be clear that waiting and further purchases are necessary to get the full story."

This story appears to be published under Hosted Games, where you can submit your story to Choice of Games, and they can publish it if they think it's good enough (Stories published under Choice of Games are commissioned by professional writers.) Hosted Games can be good. Zombie Exodus is excellent, go try it. But I recognise that these authors are not professional, so I can forgive lesser quality for more creativity.This story, however, is a disappointment on both fronts. There's no other way to put it: the writing is terrible. You can on ly play 3 cliched archetypes. I can't even immerse myself into the archetypes because the dialogue is awkward. I want to choose a dialogue option that fits my character but the lines are so bad I cannot imagine anyone saying them. The story introduces a whole bunch of characters without much characterisation at once. There are some scenes that might be considered technically good, like the early terrorism scene and the park capture-the-flag scene, but they're not worth it.The writer should not be charging money for this fanfiction-quality of writing, let alone charging more per-installment (this is only the first installment!) than the all-around excellent Zombie Exodus. Choice of Games shouldn't let this quality be published under their name. I bought this game without demo-ing the game because I trusted the company to do quality assurance, because they made great games like Choice of Robots, Choice of Romance, and Heroes Rise. I'm just... seriously disappointed.P.S. If you want a better superhero/villain game, try Heroes Rise or Diabolical. If you want powers in a school setting try Psy High. They are much, much better."

It's sort of like One Punch Man but you're only power is being the main character (which I definitely don't mean as a negative; you're just a normal person.)  You experience what any other superhero college student would: romance, friendships, weirdos in strange suits, evil villains and those weird classes you had to take to graduate.Now, that may sound pretty boring or just plain odd but the way the story is written makes it very engaging and has you wonder what can happen next (and how you can not get killed by it.)

That said, the game does not end on too heinous a cliffhanger, and I plan to buy the upcoming installments (and they better be coming)-It's kind of pricey for what they are offering. I got it on sale and thought that $3 was pretty steep for 4 chapters.That all being said, I very muched liked these features about the game-Top tier waifus. Would romance a ginger with movable hair again-Sets a tone and sticks with it. Some people may find this fact to be annoying, but as someone who has consumed much of the other media in the same vein, I find it refreshing.-Very lighthearted, funny, and optimistic-Until it kicks you in the heart, and this juxtaposition is beyond welcome-Moral choices that feel rather natural as opposed to something like a ""Good/Evil bar"" or ""Did bad things? Everybody hates you all of the sudden""So in conclusion, if you like these kinds of games, get it! If not or are just starting out in the series, maybe start with something more like the ""Heroes Rise"" series.If it's on sale, get it in a heartbeat"

But don't be fooled that just because its a text game doesn't mean it isn't fast paced and full of action. It's a real ""page turner"" and it can be hard to stop and take a break from it as you just NEED to know what happens next.It's a well written story that immerses you in a world filled with characters that you can connect with. As it is a game written solely in text, it lets your imagination create the characters and in doing so you make it part of your own. You can make choices and choose your story and it's more than just playing a game and completing tasks etc. Like I said before, it's more like a table top RPG with only your imagination to visualize the world described in words. A great deal of skill is required to bring a world to life with graphics, but it is just as skillful to paint it in words while still leaving enough mystery for the reader to fill in the blanks with their own interpretation."

There are no images, no animations just text yet the story is so compelling it doesn't matter.The general jist of the game is that you are a non-powered hero who got accepted into a community college made specifically for low level heros (or ""Zeniths"" as the game calls them). The rest of the game follows your hero as you make various choices that affects the plot in significant ways. Since the game is purely text based it relies soley on the story and how you connect to it and luckily this story is enganing and knows just how to pull you in. Your character is a blank canvas and throughout your story you can make your character react and do things that shapes your character into a very distinct person. You are also given a pretty good backstory that made me feel even more attached to my character and motivated to do well in my classes so I could become a kickass hero. Not only did the main character feel distinctly my own but the other characters in the game are also well crafted and have more depth to them then I unfortunately gave them credit for when I first meet them. This game definetely makes you want to play multiple times just so you can hang out with different people and find out their backstories since they are all so interesting (except maybe Uni; I hated her as much as Stoic who I tried to make my BFF in all my playthroughs-can't wait to get to know her better in part 2).As for the negatives there are a couple but they are more minor gripes than anything seriously wrong. The first one being the way you save in the game which for a little background on myself, this is the first time I've played a game that uses this program so I was pretty unaware of how to save in this game...soooo I restarted a LOT...yeah that 16 hour playtime is kinda streched out since I restarted so many times due to mistakes being made (yeah I wanted my first playthrough to be a success so if I got a D on a test I would restart or if I immediately regretted a decision I would be like NOPE and restart...I know I should've committed to some of my bad decisions but I couldn't xp ). I eventually looked up how to save and it isn't the worse thing in the world but it is a little convoluted and not as streamlined for a first time user like myself (really wish there was a save button in the menu or something rather than having to look through random files on my desktop to find it). The other gripe was how the classes worked in the beginning. You get to pick between 4 and I picked Acrobat hoping that would make me fast, agile, and one of those ""hit them soft but fast"" sorta bee-like I guess? Anyways Acrobat was just another hard hitter and not the agile ninja I was hoping for. I read he plans to get rid of the Acrobat class completely and just combine it with another class (I think it was Solider class but not 100% on that information) which kinda sucks but make sense because Acrobat doesn't seem distinct enough as it is.So to wrap up despite a couple minor gripes this game is great. If you are looking for something with a great story where your decisions actually matter than this is the game for you! I can say at least I look forward to Part 2!"

Overall, it was a highly entertaining text-based game that was kinda satisfying for me. You, first off, sort of create your own hero by what your real name is, your hero name, what you wear for your uniform, what sort of personality you are. You are given as a powerless sort of super hero (BATMAN!) but you can go above that. This is a big stats game, as your choices affect your personality (Joker, Brooder, Traditionalist, Charmer), natural stats you have (like strength, stealth and stuff), your relationships with your fellow students and teachers, and what your grades are for the exams. Yes, you take exams. You're really in a superhero school where you have to study and such. On experience, I was quite popular (tried to stay on everyone's good side), didn't date anyone although I could have (wasn't really interested in dating those type of characters, but that's just me), and did really well in classes. There, of course, is another story that surrounds this adventure, which is the villian that's against the school. Some drawbacks I had were that some of the choices didn't really affect the story (you'd choose things but there was no outcome - wasn't too sure why it was asked), you're not completely finished because this is a series of games so you will have little closure (especially that after the event in the fourth chapter) and some of the charcters have little background, but it might be due to your choices. It's definitely not the best CYOA, but for the price of this game (especially if it was on sale), the game play I got just from one story, the immersion you have in it, it was worth it."

The story revolves around your character as they begin their first day of a community college meant to train aspiring superheroes. I honestly love this story, this was my first time playing a text-based game like this, and was worried it would be boring and not keep my interest, but to my surprise it was the opposite. I was almost immediatly hooked and loved the story. The choices felt like they mattered, and i felt in control the entire time. I felt as if I was actually there. The game also supports LGBT for anyone who considers them selves that, which is a nice touch. This is part one of four, and is a great start to a hopefully successful series. Overall, I highly recommend this game, and is worth every penny. Thank you for taking the time to read my review."

The story rips my heart to shreds. :'(I've only played it once, and I don't think my poor heart could handle a second round.The choices are meaningful, and they have a lot to do with your initially picked strengths as well as the situationally implied logic. My one complaint is the lack of improvement in stats - by which I mean that there are rarely any opportunities for the stats to increase... I'm hoping this is on purpose as the story (time-wise) seems to cover only a little portion of what is to come.All in all, it's definitely worth a play-through.We'll miss you, Origami. I regret not getting to know you better."

I found it easy to put myself into the hero that I made and it only made it that much more emotional. Every decision leaves you wondering if your doing the right decision. The other games I've played by Hosted Games has most of the time had a decision that was the best or worst, but this one never has that. Every choice has both positive and negative effects, even the neutral choices. If you want a complete game, this may not be the one for ou YET. But if you want the best experience, this is the game. My hat's off to you Host Games."

Interesting storyline, lively characters and connections, good choice of words, well put together.the only thing that bothers me is the Zenith Grading ( based on x number of people one can handle? Sounds vague)apart from that, fantastic! would love to see the next one coming"
