Now is your time to change one of britains most famous stories.While it differs in quite some things  from the original (naturally), it catches the dramatic events of Arthurs way from ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ son to Ruler of the Kingdom in it´s war against the evil Saxon invaders.Offering a special treat, Pendragon Rising includes the option to change the whole main cast from male to female, which also presents a different take on the story itself.Will you strive to make peace via diplomacy wherever possible or be a revengeful ruler without mercy? An opportunistic coward or a true hero, who inspires your folk with brave speeches?The writing is also enjoyable enough to fit the theme, while friends of the classic adventure topic, where you rally your allies together with your close group of friends should feel right at home.Conclusio: This has to be one of my favourite CYoA books up to now, as the atmosphere is really enjoyable, the characters likeable/hateable and it has enough content, to play it more than once, and even get a fully different setting.Rating: 8/10"

Tried it out regardless, and I definitely do not regret these past 3 hours.It's very immersive if you do read it through, and definitely worth a second, or third, or fourth playthrough, to see what would happen if you were a pious madman, or a greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, or a humble ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ trying to avoid the throne.All the choices you make will affect the things that happen to you, how people will respond to your actions, and so on. Sometimes, if you think you're making the wrong choice for the wrong reasons, you end up making the right choice for the wrong reasons... And sometimes it's the wrong choice for the right reasons that ends up being the reason your potential ally is now your enemy!Great, short game, worth the money. Live through Arthur's fight for the Kingdom."

You've chosen to be a mighty Warrior thus far, then in the set-up for a battle you choose a solid not-too-crafty strategy option - come the finale for that scene you might be shocked to find suddenly your low Leadership and high Warrior scores have completely switched, meaning ""challenge their leader one-on-one"" puts you on the receiving end of a almighty whupping.It is - as ever - a robust game regardless, I just found this one quite flawed in terms of supporting role-playing."

The author obviously knows quite a bit about Arthurian legend and pre-Medieval Europe, and they have used this knowledge to weave a well-written narrative with compelling characters. If you enjoy reading and fantasy fiction, I highly recommend this. People looking for visceral and visual action should look elsewhere."

I will say that going into it I didn't expect much as my past experience with text based games was not great, however I am happy that Pendragon Rising was able to reverse that. It had some great reveals and for the most part delivered on the promise of the choices you make being something that matters. It is by no means perfect as sometimes I felt a lack of depth in the alliance building you can engage through diplomacy, but as I've only got 1 playthrough under my belt I bet that there is a lot I missed.Over all for the price it asks and the replay value I would suggest to pick this game up you won't regret it."

Against your will, you get caught up in the war with the Saxons, and unwittingly become the Warleader of your people. Will you be able to gather enough allies to help you stand against the Saxons? And what kind of leader will you be -- a fearless warrior or a more peaceful diplomat? But the most important question of all: will you eventually take the crown for yourself?Pros+ The atmosphere is fantastic; it oozes mythic warriors of long-forgotten times+ The author obviously knows a lot about Arthurian lore+ The relationships between the characters were superb; I felt really invested in my protagonist's friendships+ Despite it being shorter than most CoG games in length, it feels just as rich as the others+ You actually get to pick choices that are not ""canon"" in Arthurian legendCons- Despite the relationships feeling so real, there was no stat for them per character- No save points- Limited romance options (be warned of the famous incest relationship if that freaks you out)Great game, and I was invested in my character and their relationships right from the start. Recommended for fans of interactive novels with Arthurian themes!Note: choosing to play as either the male Arthur or the female Arta swaps all the main characters' genders around to match that of the protagonist (except for Morgan/Morgana). Playing as Arta, it was actually really cool to imagine all those massive armies of women marching through old Britain!"

It conveys the atmosphere of a fractured, post-Roman Britain quite well, and although it has some fantastical elements, these are quite subdued for the most part and maintains a more realistic approach.I found the writing to be engaging and enjoyable, and quite a few of the choices you make are recognized later on the in story, meaning that my decisions actually had some weight to them.SPOILERS INCOMING!I also greatly appreciated the fact that the game allowed you some flexibility in terms of the outcome. You do not have to stick to the classic Arthurian story. I actually deliberately avoided becoming king and prefered to work behind the scenes. You are not railroaded into taking the throne. You have the option of stepping down and supporting someone else instead, and this enhances the role-playing element."

,Recommended,423320,19541937,"Posted: 6 December, 2015",all,The Coltster,"This will be the first review I've written for a game on Steam. So bear with my rough assessment.Pendragon Rising an old style text-based adventure where nearly, if not every decision you make matters in some way to the story. Unfortunately I missed the age of Text based games, so playing this as my first pure experience was quite fun.As expected, the roughly 3 hours (per read-through) of gameplay consists solely of making decisions, leading to what kind of King Arthur/Queen Arta you will be. This consists of these main traits. Leadership, Diplomacy, Warrior, Compassion v. Ruthlessness, Bravado v. Cunning, and Old Religion v. Roman Christianity. But regardless of what kind of ruler you are, you are almost positive to get a rich story.Pros:+Great and immersive story.+Fun experimentation with choices. Each one truly feels unique.+Romances (Or flings) feel pleasantly tasteful.+Writing is very strong, I don't recall seeing any spelling errors.Cons:-Personally wish the read length was longer.-There was a choice or two I found were hard to understand what was meant in context.Taking everything I've said I strongly recommend this game, with a solid 9/10. If you've got a few hours to spare, or even more for several read-throughs, it's definitely worth the humble price of $4. I'm looking forward to more stories from this developer!"

,Recommended,423320,19563364,"Posted: 8 December, 2015",all,The Static Wizard,"Pendragon Rising is a super fun, super engaging interative fantasy adventure where your choices have a very real sense of consquence - that is to say, the effects of your choices feel meaningful, subtle and consistent. The writing is very good, the characters memorable, and most noticably the story is paced very well with moments of, yes, conflict and magic, but also intimate spaces where you explore Arthur/Arta's place in the rapidly changing landscape of dark age Britain.Choosing gender is also a matter of simply choosing which sex is the dominant one in Britain at that time. It is very well implemented, with consequences to being female that feel true to the nature of womanhood while also not diminishing it unecessarily. There are a few gender / name replacement typos, but they are little more than a distraction.The game lasted only two or three hours long, but at £2 it's still a steal. I was gripped thoroughly and played it in one sitting. Also there is some sense in replaying it - how would a less diplomatic, more violent Arta turn out? Ultimately I don't want to because I have a very clear vision of my version of Arta, but the choice is still there.One downside was the lack of sound. There isn't any sound at all - music or otherwise. I put on a Celtic music playlist and it sufficed, keeping in line with the lore.Fans of dark age mythos and history, or even roleplayers, should really enjoy this. I sincerely hope that I can continue Arta's adventures in the future."

My main gripe - No saves. There is literally no way to go back and see what a different choice would have done without doing ALL the choices over again. Which means in order to do everything, to see what your decisions do, you need to make your own flowchart, because you can make multiple saves to do divergent paths.2. My second gripe - Achievements. The achievements are listed as not just being something you successfully did, but as having a ""point value"". This implies that those points could be used for something. They can't. Period.3. While you *can* fail, it seems like you can only really fail at the end, or very close to it. Even intentionally making the stupidest of decisions will leave you alive for quite some time.Don't take these things as me saying the game is horrible, it isn't. But these are the main issues I have with it."

The characters are well-written, as their personalities are unique and have specialties that make them stand out. The story doesn't quite change much, but your choices influence the outcome of the endings. The ending is rather short, though. Like, really short. Kind of wished there was more of an exposition in the end, but the meat of the story was rather filling.Plus there a little bit of incest with a character. Why oh why..."

,Recommended,423320,28654390,"Posted: 25 December, 2016",all,altKiwi,"A very engaging take on the Arthurian legend that focuses more on King Arthur's ascension to power rather than the tales of him and the Round Table. Pendragon Rising frames the legend by having Arthur (or, should you choose, Arta) be involved in political intrigue in a time of war. Each character you meet is relatable and bears significant weight whether it be in that very moment or in the grand scheme of things. The story presented by Ian Thomas is well-crafted - it's told in such a manner that it does its best to avoid stepping on the toes of Arthurian historians while making it accessible to those who have no prior knowledge of King Arthur or the history of the Britons and the Saxons.Pendragon Rising differs from other ""Choice Of..."" text-based choose-your-own adventures in that it's more concerned with telling a story rather than asking you, the reader, ""what would you do in this situation?"" Rather than explore myriad choices and possibilities, Pendragon Rising asks you instead to be the best Arthur/Arta you can be. There are choices to explore and options to be had, but ultimately some choices are better than others. It's similar to a Japanese visual novel in that there are certain events you need to trigger for certain sequences to play out optimally - otherwise you find yourself at a game over screen.Overall, Ian Thomas's story is enjoyable and well worth the price. For those of you interested in text-based games, this is a very good addition to any collection. For those who are not but are looking for a good way to pass the time, I would still recommend Pendragon Rising for those interested in a medieval fantasy setting that incorporates magical elements."

If you choose to play as a heroine, the story is suddenly about amazon woman warriors with men being the weaker sex, who follow their leader women from the sidelines. Who wants to read something like that? I speak solely for myself of course, but I thought this change in plot was of very bad taste. Where was the part of princess? Medieval times!

(You can just skim it in like 30 minutes once you've played through it easily)I will give this game a thumbs up for it has tried to do a bit more with King Arthur than I expected it to, I do hope you enjoy it.SPOILERS if you're a fan of incest, this is the interactive book for you."

Fret not, for Pendragon Rising (And other games from Choice of Games) lets you use your imagination to power their stories. Pendragon Rising is a well written story that urges the reader to quickly come to grasp with the lore of the world, which there is quite a bit to learn on every playthrough. The romance system in the story isn't at all what you've seen in other CoG games, but personally I find it refreshing and a tad bit more relatable. My only complain about the game is how short it can be- it took me roughly 2.5 hours to finish it in my first run, shorter if I hadn't restarted it twice. But it does have high replayability if you're willing to read through some of the other mandatory texts."

As far as advantages are concerned, you can really enjoy the process of the game. It is like reading a new book (or even writing your own) and using your imagination to rule the turn of the plot and the minds of the heroes. There is a great plus because you feel free to choose what to say and do. One more advantage is that plot-based structure of the game develops your memory and attention. So, you have to think not only about your actions but also about their consequences.Among the disadvantages I can name only one thing. Sometimes the game ends too fast. On the other hand, the twists and turns of the plot are different and have several versions. So, if one choice of the steps brings a player to fast anding of the story, he always have a chance to build up a new story line and change the order of things."

Are you a fan of reading in general? Then maybe this is for you!It's rather straight forward, you got a written story that you read like a book and ocasionally the ""game"" will stop and let you chose what happens next. The story will change depending on your choices, this is an idea we have seen a lot of recently, however, since this is a purely text based game it is much easier to make the story REALLY change since you don't need to change any graphics or voice acting.I can't however personally vouche for how much the story changes in this case since I only finished it once - but I did get the distinct feeling that things could have been quite different, especially after reading other peoples experiences with the story.The story itself is interesting and well written, I got the same feeling I used to get when reading fantasy novels as a teenager. Is it worth the price? If you go by the old 1$/€ per hour formula, yes, it's currently 3,99€  as I type this and I got it at sale for less than half that - and I got at least a solid 5 hours of entertainment out of it and an interesting fresh experience.I had ONE problem with Pendragon Rising and I do not know if it's title specific or common to the genre as it's the only text based game on steam that I have tried, but I did not feel like I got a conclusive ending because I did not make the right choices. The game ended on a rather bitter note and I felt like it was basically telling me ""Game over, try again"" if I wanted the REAL ending.Since I don't know where I went wrong a second attempt would probably mean I took all the same actions  as I felt all of them were the ideal ones, and i'd change one or two things only in order to see if I could get a better ending which is by no means a guarantee, this basically means i'd spend hours rereading the same content multiple times trying to fish for the best ending which does not sound like much fun, and using a guide feels kind of pointless as i might as well just read a book in that case.In the end I had to be happy with my lackluster ending and move on. So will I recommend it? Im not sure as im typing this, I would definetely recommend text based games, and Pendragon Rising has a good story - but the issue it has is a big one to me.I will give it a thumbs up, it's good for what it is and it did provide me with an ending, albeit a lackluster one - i'd suggest to look at other text simulators before settling on this one to see if they have the same issue."

76561198168647573,Recommended,423320,33245968,Posted: 4 July,all,lachanshachak,"It's interesting enough, plenty of action and weirdness, but it's written like some history textbook. No humor (which I find to be the centerpiece of anything I read, watch, or do, and if it's not funny I automatically like it less).Another problem is that if you die - which I did - you have to start everything again. Also, I'm not sure if your choices have a long-term effect on the outcome. It seems that your choice will only affect what happens immediately afterwards, or maybe the course of one chapter. So basically, whatever you choose has no effect except whether you die.Now, after being a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ by starting with only the bad things, let's move to the boring part - the good things: the story was interesting, I liked the villain (sadly, not for her personality - only because she's really cool), the setting was nice (medieval Britain -who doesn't love it?), and my character was someone important, which is a nice change of pace from real life.It's pretty long - It took me 2.7 hours, and as I mentoned, I died. So I probably had, like, half an hour left minimum. I personally think that's a good thing, but you may have your own interpretation."

The game had me hooked from start to finish, and immersed me into a roller coaster ride of tough choices, interrupted with comical moments. I found that the more I played, the less I looked back on those hard choices made. Despite not ending up on the path to becoming the traditional Arthur, my experience felt richer and equally satisfying. Cons: Wished that there was more development of character relationships, reminiscent of BG I & II. Also, I just wish that the game didn't end so abruptly.I would like to have seen the Pendragon story continue for many sagas covering the whole life of Arthur.8/10"
76561198055369386,Not Recommended,423320,29228200,Posted: 13 January,all,Trolldrool,"I wanted to like this game, because I've played a fair number of text based games I enjoy from this company, but the stat system got too frustrating and quite honestly just take me out of the immersion. There's simply no clarity to what each action will lead to and at times make me feel like I am being punished for the choices I make. Face all my opponents singlehandedly and take them out? Does nothing for my close combat stats. Responding to an event with a shred of humility gives me a huge penalty to my warrior abilities. Okay? I guess the warrior stat is affected by more than just combat then. That's actually pretty creative.Few scenes later, make the smart decisions and plan ahead for an attack, rally my warriors and lead the charge. Somehow decreases my warrior abilities. Why? Because I had to charge off on my own apparently. The fact that I asked one of my battlesworn friends to assist me somehow made me worse of a fighter. There's no consistency to what actions affect which stats in which way. And the thing is that I don't have a problem with ability decreases in these games because they usually mean that another ability will get an increase. Which is the case here too for 3/6 of them. On the others, you get an increase or a decrease and no increasing one does not mean increasing the other, at least not consistently.With the cons out of the way, I suppose it's only fair I move onto the pros.In truth, the stat system has me extremely frustrated and the main reason for that is because it takes away the immersion and enjoyment of a story I actually enjoyed. I might have rolled my eyes on a few scenes, but ultimately I found the concept intriguing. It's a rendition that tries to appeal to chronological accuracy of the saxon invasion of Briton while at the same time keeping some of the mythology and mystery that make the Arthurian legends so fascinating.At times you must rely on the advanced medicinal knowledge of scholars trained in Rome while at other times you must rely on the native druids and their knowledge of the land. At times you must approach a mystery from a rational perspective, while at others that which seems like superstition is actually the better option. I really enjoy that, especially because most games (text-based or high budget) I've come across just do one or the other. Embarrass the silly priests with the wonders of science or silence the unbelievers with displays of magic. This game doesn't go for either direction and plays on the setting that both could have value. As I mentioned earlier, there are some moments where I rolled my eyes, mostly due to events that were no doubt meant to be shocking feeling predictable and clichéd, but I enjoyed the writing overall. I liked the pacing and the characters and I could immerse myself in their internal struggles. But the stat system just feels broken and prevents me from completing the game."
