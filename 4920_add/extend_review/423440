I wont give anything away but I will say that if you've ever played Jade Empire, and enjoyed it's style and storytelling, then Choice of Kung Fu will give you another chance to explore such a world again. Full of Kung Fu, Chi, Fox Spirits, Romance, and Rebellion; I was once again, pulled into the story of a single monk residing in a small monastery on the side of a mountain, seeking to learn from the fabled Dragon Sage. The breadth of play styles are impressive and refreshing as is usual in a Choice of Games/Hosted Games title. While the one ending I have gotten was fitting, it left me wanting more. Though, this is a testament to the quality of the story telling rather than the feeling of an incomplete narrative.A highly pleasurable title from our always entertaining friends at CoG/HG and the writers they help promote. I can solidly recommend Choice of Kung Fu to anyone who is a fan of, or has passing interest in, a Chinese themed setting that spans your life as a monk of the Order of the Peach Tree. Years will go by and it will be your choices that dictate the fate of the very nation you live in. Will you fight with honor and be as the Buddha would be? Perhaps you will dedicate your life to the pursuit of martial prowess and open a Dojo? Maybe you would just like to live happily with your thoughts as you create poetry with your lover? Maybe none of these things. That is the fun part of these games.It's all up to you!"

In the early game it is all about building your character's skills and the late game is all about using those skills. A bad decision can give you a bad result. There is a lot of veriety of skills you can build and use and it creates some very interesting experiences. What is even better, the overall goal of the game changes based off what the player wants to do. I actually ended up changing my goal the first time I played based on my character's experiances. That is a rare thing for a game to do, and I approve."

Interesting story well worth the money and play time.8/10 As Zhuge Goku made love to a fox-demon. Hoped to father a kid mixed of Gohan and Naruto. Didn't. Very disappointed.
,Recommended,423440,20776103,"Posted: 26 January, 2016",all,Octobig,"This interactive visual novel/text-based game brings you into a Chinese mythical world of monks, kung-fu fighting, fox spirits, wise teachers, and the Empire. Decide your own personal style of kung-fu and find your path while you rise in the ranks of your Order. Eventually, you might meet the wise Dragon Sage and ask them a question, but before that, you will have to make many choices -- about your stance with the Empire, your friends and rivals, and what to do with your strength and knowledge.The Good+ A great, somewhat mythical setting in ancient China+ Engaging characters, especially the teachers/masters and the fox spirit(s)+ As always, lots of different choices and endingsThe Bad- No save points- Limited romance options- Style of kung-fu not as detailed as I thought it would beAs always, if you're into Choose Your Own Adventure games and you also like mythical China (and/or kung-fu), then you'll probably like this game! The only thing I didn't like that much was the lack of depth in some of the romance options -- some of them feel more like side characters than actual participants in your story. But I suppose the whole game itself is more about your personal journey as a whole.Not my personal favourite out of the CoG lineup so far, but still a good one!"

,Recommended,423440,21656283,"Posted: 5 March, 2016",all,Very-Corny,"As someone who love old chinese kung fu movie and manhua, I would say this game is well made with some odd choice of wordings.In this game, the use of ""magic"" and ""chi"" are confusing for the first time player, if they are the same in the game, why not just use ""chi"".  I sure most people when they see the word ""magic"" they thought of stuff like throwing fireball which is clearly not here.  There are more words in the game that is somewhat out of place but is fairly easy figure out by the first timer.Also I like to point out is that some wording of choice the author use is very suggestive, believe me, you not going to fall for the demon fox trap on your first playthrough because the choice itself will tell you not to fall for her trap.Did I mention I love old chinese stuff earlier, because this game is clearly not one.  I would say the auther is strongly influence by the modern TV drama while writing this, you can tell by the setting it use.  One point there is dragon, demon, and immoral, which is great materials for old setting fantasy, then by the end, you probably will ask why even bother.Overall, this game is a good buy, the achievement part is very fun, but if you have a choice between this and other choice of game, I say go with the latter."

It allows the user to alter the storyline and choose their fate, this is also really good as it gives the audience a chance to choose gender (so the target demographic is bigger doing this and equal).I like this game as it shows stats showing how you're doing this is very good and vital for the game as the choices you make decides on the person you are and if you're really worthy as a monk and a teacher but the question is are you going to choose to be good or bad? ;)"

,Recommended,423440,23491251,"Posted: 10 June, 2016",all,RobbeJK,"DISCLAIMER: This review is more of a review of the entire Choice of X ""series"" than only this game - but I have the same opinion for all the games so this will work just fine for this. --------- REVIEW: Where do I start? This game - it's in a quick summary simply amazing. The amount of work put into this makes it such a wonderful piece of art. The thought of a text based game may be quite effective as a deterrent at first glance but if you actually decide to play the game itself - you will see that it is simply a conclusion you came to rather than a fair representation of the game. The game is essentially a choose your own story type of game (which I am sure you already figured) but with a nice touch to it - since there is no audio or graphics (except for the text of course) there are really no limitations - instead of the game lacking in depth but making up for it in graphics or audio for example (*cough* Battlefront 3 *cough*) this game has been able to focus all of it's resources on the story itself making it a wonderful game with such a great story. I would absolutely recommend checking it out - it's definetly worth it and if you don't like it - refund it! As long as you keep the time under 2 hours during the first 2 weeks you're set (And I seriously doubt that you'll need 2 hours to decide.) But all in all I'd say a solid 10/10 I really wish more people would check this series out. (By the way - if you like this game or are interested in another game like this I'd recommend Choice Of Robots - also really well made and was the first one I bought in this series haha)"

I bought this bc I am a Chinese and I really wanna see how English speaking ppl would write a Chinese story, and I have to say...well, hard to describe how I feel about it.HuliJing, the fox spirit, really??? I laughed at this lol. I thought this would a kinda reality-based game but I was soooo wrong. Seriously, it's funny to see they literally translate fox spirity as Hulijing.The story itself it's not that attractive to me, probably because it's not any Chinese story at all. But hey, it's not a super expensive game, so recommend if you want to kill time, otherwise, don't.Also, I really want to say: whoever drew the cover, I can't appreciate your art. Sorry, but pls, this cover looks like drawn by a twelve year old."

Unfortunately there are no do overs when it comes to your decisions. If you decide to alter a choice, you have to start all the way at the beginning, which can be frustrating depending on how far into the story you are.An important thing for new players to be aware of is the outcome of your decisions appears to be based on your stats. I got different outcomes to similar choices on my second playthrough, because I built my stats differently from the first run.  While this means certain playthroughs will require planning your decisions ahead of time, it also means there are multiple ways to deal with a situation both in success and failure, which offers replay value.I've heard the game is shorter than other Choice Of games, but it was fun for an introductory into their style, and I'm interested in other games they have to offer!"

While I find myself enjoying that game more, this was an engrossing story that kept me entertained and caused me to go through the entire story in one sitting.  Please note that this is more like a choose your own adventure book just presented in digital form (and with far more options that those books ever provided).  It is not even a visual novel, it is simply words on a page and the choices you get to make, with a series of stats behind the scenes that dictate the flow of the story and options available to you as well.  If you can find yourself engrossed in a tale like this without pictures to go with it or if you enjoy discover and text adventures like the incredible Analogue: A Hate Story I'm sure that you will enjoy this as well."

,Recommended,423440,20595590,"Posted: 17 January, 2016",all,FyriFloo,"While this is one of the shorter ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" novellas produced by Choice Games, I actually consider it to be one of the better titles. Alana Joli Abbott authored a story that is worth replaying on occasion, reveals a significant amount of research, has choices with consequences that make sense, and leads to several endings that feel not just rewarding, but inspiring.My few objections are that a couple of romance options don't seem to be romantic at all, the player's choice of fighting style doesn't have a lot of specifics, and there could be some more opportunities to introduce cause and effect into this tale.Highly recommend picking this up and replaying at least once a year for the story. Achievements are a bit on the easy side compared to other Choice Games, so mastery is quite probable within a few short hours if you pay attention and read quickly."

It's hard to say, but I think it has the best writing, a variety of empowering choices, and some cool achievements, both easy and difficult to get. The main reason why I like it over all the other Choice of games is that of the theme. I daresay you can never go wrong with a story about kung fu, but the author of this has done all the research necessary and has made the whole thing incredibly realistic, while not leaving out things like magic. As always, the writing is absolutely top quality."

As such, there is something to learn on top of an entertaining and varied experience. If you like CoG, this one is an easy recommendation."
,Recommended,423440,35148183,Posted: 23 September,all,Morrier,"A very fun little choose your own adventure tale, its definitely one of the best crafted; all the stats seem to nicely correlate with my play style, and I thoroughly enjoyed the choices I was given. If I had any complaints, it would be the somewhat abrupt ending; it felt as if there was at least another third or quarter of the game left when I got the ending screen. It wasn't a deal breaker, nor did it leave a sour taste in my mouth, but I would have prefered a little more closure or at least an epilogue.I digress; Choice of Kung Fu is a very solid title, possibly one of the most solid ones from this publisher. It never gets preachy or mired in exposition, and gives the player a good sense of being a martial arts protagonist."
