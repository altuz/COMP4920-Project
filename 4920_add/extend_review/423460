,Not Recommended,423460,23006874,"Posted: 15 May, 2016",all,Whiterabbit-uk,"If you have Trainz a New Era, you don't need this as it's just a cut down version of  it.  I used to buy Trainz because they  were  good  value for money. Previous versions of the game   not only gave you a fully functional train oriented  world, they gave you masses of  free rolling stock and  engines  that would keep most train enthusiasts  happy  for   hundreds of hours. Sadly  the developers of  this new version of Trainz have jumped on the Railworks band wagon/cash cow and    added hundreds of pounds worth of  dlc with more to come.    I can't recommend this to anyone at this time and I'm very disappointed in  the Trainz dev's for introducing this model  to their  world.  The main difference between   this game and it's  competitor Train Simulation 2016 (formerly Railworks) is  that Railworks has    a much larger  seelection of  trains and  new rail routes (that are also expensive when not on sale)  plus the graphics are  in my opinion much better.   Also,     dlc for previous versions of  Trainz are not forwards compatible with this new version, whereas all  dlc purchased for  any version of Railworks is forwards compatible.There's no way I'm going to re purchase   dlc for this game that I've already purchased for previous versions; shame on you  N3V games.   I think I'll be sticking with Train Simulator 2016  from now on.  Good-bye Trainz."

I am very upset I lost 20 I could of spent on another game."

It is poor, you are only getting a part of the game.  I was trying out the East Coast Main line.  Loading the drive option.  Sessions are extra money!After waiting what seemed like an age for this to load, disappointment followed.  Its the same as the 2012 version.  Slow, poor graphics.I' running this on a Gtx 970 and having 16gb of ram.  The dials in the cab of the Deltic don't do anything.  So New Era, same as before.The graphics, are flat and poor almost cartoon like.  Sounds are unrelistic, Deltic horns wrong.I actually play a lot more Train Simulator 2016, it's not the best. However that is a far more polished product than Trainz New Era.So lucky I never paid full price for this"

Thank you and have a nice day."

As an owner of two other Trainz products I can say that this newest instalment is far from disappointing. Graphics are fantastic and even though there is no Surveyor mode, trains can still be placed by the player and you can explore any map. Overall a great game and worth the money."

Then, most DLC's refer you to purchasing Trainz a new era! Or the DLC won't work. Whats the point of putting 2016 on the title if the sim is outdated already!"
