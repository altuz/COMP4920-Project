My biggest fear was that it would be like Heleborne but fortunately it's not that arcady. The controls are simplified vs a real helicopter but they still feel enough like the real thing to make you feel like you're flying.The graphics are really nice and the maps well put together, though some of them could be bigger, and it would be nice if there was a map view so you could see your location and have some idea of when you're going to hit the edge.The model of the Mi-24 is really nicely done though it does have some quirks. The nose landing gear retracts in a really odd manner though this is nit picking as it's hardly noticeable.The game runs super smooth, the maps load really fast and the only drop in framerate I experiened was when firing the podded Yak-B gatling guns over the largest city. That was earlier in developement and after a year it now runs perfectly smooth in all conditions.Usually I'm not a fan of combat in flying games, I just like flying around, however this games battles are really fun, especially the quick mission city attacks. It's actually quite challenging a lot of the time and I am really struggling to get to grips with the guided missles.Despite the name other Soviet/Russian helicopters have been added to the game which is very appreciated. My only problem with these is that the cockpits of the Mi-28 and Ka-50 are basically unfinished with little detail and many dead guages and screens. The Mi-8 cockpit is better though it seems to be based on some weird Westernised modification to the standard Mi-8 cockpit.Watching the game develope has been very satisfying. The developers have really listened to the community and I actually feel like i've had some input into the final product."

It's kinda like those helicopter sections from Ace Combat Assault Horizon, but without the setpieces, scripted events and fancy missile dodges.You control a Mi-24 Hind gunship, one of the meanest sight anyone could ever see in their airspace.You control your war chariot either with keyboard and mouse which I haven't used or a 360/Xbone pad which works surprisingly well and the controls, even on pilot setting, are extremely easy to master and effective. You'll be doing sideways strafing runs on opfor camps like nobodys bussines.The game, being in early alpha, is a bit prone to crash here and there. I noticed that if you enable steam overlay while the game is loading, it gets stuck once the game reaches the ""press any button to continue"" part, meaning you have to forcibly turn off the game from the task manager.There are also a bit of bugs, nothing too major though. For example, if you run out of ammo for a weapon like a gunpod for example, and hold the trigger down, the screen contiues to shake like it was firing.All the enemies look like WWII Americans. This is not a bug really, maybe either a developer hindsight, a place holder or we actually are fighing evil imperialistic Americans trying to invade the motherland.The game is loads of fun though, raining down death and hatred from your unstoppable war chariot.For the current price of 16 or so dollaridoos, this game was worth it in my opinion if you want some light helicoter combat simulator action without going too techincal or too arcadey, a perfect balance of both. It is kinda short thought, like you can play though the campaign in a hour or two short. There is instant action to keep you occupied too, but at 16 bucks you could ask for a bit more than 2 hours.Now go forth and become Mors, Mara, Izanami, Hel or whatever for you are become death, the destroyer of worlds."

After playing it however I realized it is mainly an arcadey game with no sense of simulation whatsoever. While I am fine with an arcadey game this game is just bad and I cannot recommend it. I played a few of the missions and I couldn't force myself through it. The sound effects and music are incredibly awful, everytime you kill a soldier on the ground you hear the same repeated scream. (Also, why can I hear the screams of the soldiers when I am inside my helicopter?) Helicopters are easy to fly but the handling of them is really awkward, it is really sad when helicopters in GTA V fly better and more naturally than the helicopters in this game. The only good part of this game are the graphics and they are ok at best.TLDR: don't play this game, if you're looking for a game to fly helicopters that is an arcade/simulation experience just play arma 3."

This game is the russian helicopter equivalent, possibly even doppleganger.  For an EA game, I'm impressed.  There is no way the authors of this game didn't borrow heavily - but that's a very good thing.The controls are excellent, even with a gamepad/steam-controller I can fly NOE, dodge, and shoot to my heart's content.Though I do wish there was head/eye-tracking support, (Apache:AA's shining implementation of the IHADSS was entirely too much fun - it also had a gunner AI)Framerate is pretty darn good. I'm running it in 4K on an RX480, so there's that.Sadly, there's also no VR support - which I kinda expect from flying sims.  But there's a cockpit view - so ...there's hope?...either way, this game is *great* fun, and seems to have a fleshed-out campaign.

It supports joysticks and gamepads, but the keyboard+mouse control implementation is amazingly well-executed too.This isn't a hardcore sim by any definition, but it's a perfect example of quick-fix air combat gaming. Give it a shot! The first two difficulty levels are perfect for new players, and the ""Pilot"" mode is reasonably simmy."
76561198121104012,Recommended,423490,31497498,Posted: 1 May,all,SolitaryHowl,"Excellent game, very fun to play.  Controls take a bit getting used to, but helicopters are hard to fly IRL as well so I find that to be okay.Pros:- Great graphics and effects- Fun gameplay. I especially love the rescue missions! More of those, please?- Excellent controls. Takes a while to get used to, but once you do you'll feel like you're actually flying a helicopter.Cons:- Singleplayer campaign is way too short- You don't have to land to rearm, you can just do it in mid-air. This makes it too 'arcadey' and detracts from the experience.I suggest adding a 'realistic' mode where you have to find a helipad (there can be a couple per map), land on it, and wait a few seconds to rearm instead.- The hitboxes on the missiles and enemies seem to be messed up. Its incredibly hard to hit an enemy (example: tank) with regular missiles.- Some optimization issues on certain maps, most noticable on the foggy jungle map & the arctic map.- Some minor bugs (a few foot soldiers will still be alive even though the mission prompt says you killed everyone)- Minor annoyances (After an instant action mission, you are taken back to the main menu instead of to the instact action screen.)Even though there are more cons than pros, I would still recommend as this is an excellent game despite being in Early Access. I look forward to future updates from this developer & will keep an eye out for any future projects they may create.Suggestion(s) to further expand on the game experience:- More opportunities to land at your starting position after you complete a singleplayer mission so the mission feels more 'complete'. Perhaps this can be optional."

Far from a good game, but I bet you didn't expect a good game when you clicked this one anyway, did you?Air Missions: HIND is an alright game, and it benefits from the current lack of any actual good helicopter-combat games that aren't crazy sims like the DCS-series. It's main competitor is stuff like Thunder Wolves, and it's... On par with Thunder Wolves, I suppose. Beats Heliborne, in any case.So uh, buy if you want a dumb, sort-of-fun, kind-of-okay helicopter game. Don't buy if you want a good sim, or an actually good game."

As background I loved Apache 2, Comanche, etc. some 15 years ago and had a HOTAS and rudder pedal setup back then, but no more.TLDR this is a 7 out of 10 recommend (buy on sale) for Xbox controller gamers looking for a bit of approachable helicopter ""sim-lite"" nostalgia but be ready to walk away or be frustrated.I really had high hopes for this sim. Finally an approachable helicopter combat game that can be played with an Xbox controller!Sadly the Xbox controls don't feel good to me. Anything beside Pilot mode doesn't feel remotely helicopter-ish. In Pilot mode I've tried multiple different setups, but nothing clicks. There's too much going on and it feels like you are fighting the controls the whole time rather than feeling like the game experience was optimized for the controller. I got stuck on the Jungle Air Support mission near the end of the campaign where you have to do lots and lots of manual shooting because the auto-gunner is too slow and aims at friendly troops. Ultimately I've had some fun with the game, but not finishing sucks.Close air support of friendly troops in particular is NOT fun. The Jungle Air Support mission is just torture.-- The auto-gunner targets FRIENDLY troops (WHY???) and there is nothing mapped on the controller to switch targets.-- Manual aiming is frustrating, particularly while zoomed -- the camera needs to pan to follow the manual aiming box when it hits the edge of the screen when TrackIR isn't in use. You do get this behavior in autohover & gunner camera view, but that's not always viable. The sensitivity needs to be turned way down to hit anything. Perhaps map the left stick Y-access to vertical camera pan when in autohover/manual aim?  Manually panning with the D-pad is a poor solution -- you need your hands on the sticks. Why can't tapping B switch weapons and holding B reload weapons? That frees up a shoulder button to act as a ""shift or toggle key"" that could remap the sticks and face buttons when held (or toggled), allowing ""pilot mode"" and ""gunner mode"" that adds more targeting functions that currently are keyboard-only and ""freelook"". Manual gunning outside of autohover is clearly what is intended but I have been unable to achieve the control necessary to beat Jungle Air Support mission despite many, many attempts even with all the damage settings turned off and on easier difficulty.Most of the reviews for the Xbox One version really trash it - and I can't argue with their objections. I bought it on PC pre-release and had lower expectations for polish; but I was looking a sim-lite that I could play and have fun with a controller and it comes close but ultimately frustrates. I imagine the PC HOTAS or keyboard/mouse crowd may have less to complain about."

Even in it's current alpha state this game has all the base elements you want in a flight game:  Great Physics & Graphics, lots of controller options, a variety of views including a fully rendered cockpit (my preferred view) and gunner seat, FLIR and several external views, great Co-Op, PvP and team PvP, Single Skirmish, Campaign Mode and Free Flight.  Add to that chunky explosions, rag-doll infantry, custom loadouts, and just the right amount of simulation without being over-the-top realism.I'm not going to dwell on the current lack of content because this is the first public early-release of the game and the missions that are included are a promising snapshot of the direction the content developers are heading.  From what I have seen so far I have complete confidence that the future content will only get better.I bought this game along with 2 friends and we got to play all multiplayer modes together, all were extremely satisfying.  We all use Logitech 3D Extreme flight sticks that were recognized, configured, and worked almost perfectly by default.  Every feature of the Heli fits neatly on the stick so no need for mouse at all.  Even the menus can be navigated using the hat and a few buttons on the stick... very slick!  If you like to cusomize your controls, no problem, there is a full suite of custom options  including both Primary and Secondary controller recognition that has rudder and throttle-stick pilots in mind.  I also tried the keyboard-mouse controls (in Pilot mode) and found it extremely accessible to the flight-stick challenged, so don't be discouraged mouse-flyers, this game is for you too!I'm happy to see this genre being properly resurrected and so far so good.  My friends and I are really enjoying replaying the current limited content and looking forward to what this developer will deliver in the coming months.

The Hind is rather agile in real life, in this game it takes a good 15 seconds to turn 180 degrees, which is ridiculous. It also does not fly like a real helicopter at speed. You can't bank it like a real helicopter.Devs, please watch some air show footage of the Hind in flight, it's not a lumbering boat like your game portrays it.The camera views and turret aiming are rather cumbersome as well. The field of view from the first person turret doesn't aim down, to hit targets with it you need to be in third person.I've unfortunately requested a refund for now.

This meant that when playing the game, I had to simultaneously fly the helicoptor AND aim the chin turret (which was very frustrating on the more realistic control settings.)Frankly I was a bit shocked by the lack of an AI to aim the turret and steer missiles because Hind 96 for Windows 95, made about twenty years ago, included an AI known as the silicon WSO to aim the turret and steer missiles. This made the game much more playable, more realistic, and even made the game feel less lonely since hearing the WSO tell you what you had locked onto or saying ""lock broken"" if you manuvered the helicoptor in such a way that he couldn't aim at the targets made you feel more like the leader of a team as opposed to a lone individual.I made a post to this effect, describing the problems I was having and articulating why I though the game would be improved by an optional AI to aim guns and missiles. Although the developer was intially down on the idea of an AI turret gunner, when other players chimed in and supported my idea, the developer listened and added an option to use a turret and missile aiming AI to the game. This made the game much more realistic (since most real helicoptor gunships have crews of two or more in order to make use of turrets, SACLOS type missiles etc.) and much more fun.Thanks to the developer's willingness to listen to the players, this is now a great game and one of my very favorites!

I have been flying hardcore, realistic flight sims for decades and thought that this might be too ""arcade"". It's not! You can adjust the settings to make it as you wish it to be. As a fixed wing guy, helos are strange critters to me but this makes it easy to get on to flying rotors. It's a good deal for the price and the learning curve to get started isn't steep. Great for those who don't have a lot of time to devote to mastering a sim. Even if there are no more updates, it's still a good deal.These folks hit the sweet spot between arcade and realistic. Perfect choice of ride because the Hind is the big bad boy of helos. Runs great on Windows 10 without a high end graphics card. You can tweak the eye candy for what looks best and runs most smoothly with your rig.Go blow stuff up and have FUN!"
,Recommended,423490,23269552,"Posted: 29 May, 2016",all,[ShRv] Galileus,"So far in EA, Air Missions: HIND lacks some polish, needs to change some fonts and get to do some serious work on the campaign aspect. Which is really not that bad for EA - especially since the hard part, flying, is aced. HINDs feel very good to fly. The line between arcade and simulation is set so that it's easy to get into - and yet you still get to enjoy helicopter-specific maneuverability. While you can play it like a ""tank in 3d space"" on easiest control mode, the highest one gives you enough realism to feel just right.As of now (v0.63) the value proposal as-is is lacking - as can be expected in NA obviously. Nevertheless the game has really good prospects - with just a few additions of more ""instant-action"" missions replay-ability would jump through the roof. A few more options here, a few difficulty settings there, some challenges and new missions - is all the game needs, and the framework is already there and working.All in all, while a lot of work and love is still needed, the game shows a very good promise and - more importantly - Dev team seems to be well within the ability to provide."

(personally I really enjoy using the the guided missiles and the primary auto cannon)-The campaign missions take up just the right amount of time thus never feeling long and tedious.-The game is simple enough that after playing for about 10 or 15 minutes you should have a fairly good grasp on how to play.-The mission editor is very easy to learn it took me about 30mins to figure out how to make a mission with 4 different objectives.-CO-OP because who doesn't love unleashing a firestorm on insurgents with a friend.Cons-Remeber how I said the missions are great because of how short they are well this creates the problem of being able to fly right through them (pun intended) fairly quickly and being left with instant action which is Alright.-Air to air can be some what grinding.-I've played for only 8 hours now but the maps already feel kind of dull now im not saying there ugly or poorly designed they just feel kind of boring now because of how many times I've already seen the same map but for the price of the game the amount of maps you get isn't that bad to be honest.on a Side note I have yet to play multiplayer and more than likly won't I tend to play steam games by myself or co-op with a friend also I havn't checked if 3Division released a road map or somthing like that but if they intend to release more maps via DLC or a free content patch I will gladly delete what i said about boring maps I really like this game I hate saying anything bad about it.

Sure, the campaign missions are placeholder-grade and the briefing is so bad it's not even meme material (it's text only, there's no voice acting as of yet), but at least the built-in editor enables you to create your own apocalyptic extravaganza missions.My main complaint is the in-flight rearming feature. It just doesn't fit within a game that allows you to manually aim MCLOS missiles. Having to land at a FARP to rearm should be included among difficulty options. Also, the helo models can get glitchy in some cinematics.Overall, 7/10 - Needs polishing, but still would recommend."

I was able to configure the joystick and thruster unit buttons perfectly. It took a little time, what i had.I find the helicopters really nice to fly and control. After a short while i was able to fly and shoot at the same time. I would definately recommend this game to any flight fans or war fans. For the money i spent i am happy with the nice scenery,  overall graphics, good gun fire and explosions. I also bought the 3 extra choppers which were DLC and part of the deluxe edition package. All in all it cost £11.00 for everything. I have not witnessed any bugs or glitches so far so all good!I dont care if its arcadey or simulation, i just really enjoy it and i hope you do too. 🚁"

I recommend a Joystick but even with mouse and keyboard it is playable.Weapons feel good, but guided missiles are a pain to use. This is my biggest point of criticism. With a joystick, the guidance is impossible and with the mouse it feels awkward and unresponsive.All the helos feel the same Imo and sound the same. A bit more bass in the engine sounds would sound more intimidating.Graphics are nice although they are very bright. I would like to have a gamma option.I also recommend you to turn off three collision damage. Because, in some missions you have to land and small bushes that would be no problem for the helo kill it. I nudged into a little bush, My helo exploded. That is ridicolous.A option to create your own paintjobs would be nice, or more skins in general.There is a mission editor and even though I have not tried it, there are a number of user made missions avaiable.I would recommend it on a sale."
