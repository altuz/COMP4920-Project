The music is also remarkable and the characters are quite charming, but sadly I had no time to empathise with them as much as I'd like. Anyway, this game is worth a try, and I'm sure I will play it again in a not too distant future, just the same thing I used to do with Don Bluth's movies when I was a child."

The major strength is the excellent voice acting, artwork and animation. The very short, and often disjointed, narrative is the largest weakness of the game.The Little Acre is a game about Aidan who, searching for his missing father, accidentally travels to another dimension. And his young daughter Lily who follows after him in her own attempt to rescue her father.The story is the largest weakness of the game. It is short, and it feels like many things were planned but never made it into the game. At the start you are simply tossed into the story and left to figure out the details from implicit references, as if you knew the characters, their relationships and what had happened. You don't, and therefore some of the early puzzles make little sense.As the game progresses, the second problem of the story becomes apparent. The mood of the story is light, but at the same time the story mixes in some adult elements, such as the fear of losing a child. This clashes badly with the with the overall mood of the story, and it becomes quite jarring when a character goes from what should have been a devastating blow to a friendly conversation within a sentence or two. It is as if the writer couldn't decide if the game should be serious or not, and while writing in darker elements constantly returns to the lighter basic mood.The end of the game comes far too soon, and many things are left unresolved. There is quite a lot of deus-ex-machina to achieve a happy ending. It leaves a feeling of wasted potential, and there are many scenes where I have a feeling additional puzzles where planned, but never made it into the game.Visually, the backgrounds and animations are a treat. There is the occasional odd clash of art style between the cell-shaded characters and the hand-drawn style of the backgrounds. But overall, it works very well.The difficulty is low and the puzzles mostly have logical solutions. Clickable spots are clearly marked, so pixel-hunting is avoided. The game usually restricts you to one or a few scenes, so there is a limited number of things to test and backtracking is almost completely eliminated. There is also a built-in hint system.In the end, it feels like a short little introduction to a world, that is never fleshed out. The presentation is excellent, and some of the characters (such as Lily) are memorable. It's a shame that the game is held back by the narrative."
76561198178876493,Recommended,423590,32812233,Posted: 26 June,all,alenjenny,"After completing this game, I felt compelled to leave a review. This is a classic, hand-drawn 2D point and click adventure games (much to the likes of monkey island, full throttle, deponia series, broken sword, etc) and these kind of games are almost extinct due to the higher demand for action packed 3D games like call of duty, battlefield, GTA, as such. This game does not disappoint its genre. It has a good, solid, adventurous plot, it's well-written, the game's quality is excellent (in terms of graphics, programing, music, sound, etc) and does not resemble a low budget and low quality game, despite the low asking price of the game. And personally, I really like how the game isn't overly complicated or practically impossible to figure out the puzzles/solutions without referring to a walkthrough, such as those classic adventure games that I mentioned above. This type of gameplay is no longer very practical (I'm looking at you: Thimbleweed park. lol) in this new era of gaming generation (whereby the only way you can solve most of the puzzles is to try everything you have in your inventory on everything around you everywhere you go). I'm glad I can finish the game without referring to any walkthrough, though I use the in-game hints once in a while.So, to sum up, if you're an avid point and click adventure gamer, you really shouldn't pass this by. It's a must-play title. A rare gem that's really hard to come by nowadays. If you're not an adventure gamer as such, you may or you may not like this title, depending on your personal preferences. But I really do urge you to give it a chance. It's a really good change of scenery among all those 3D action packed games and it wont take up much of your time. I manage to complete it within 2 hours.As for the downside of the game, as mentioned above, it's really short. I estimate it will take about 2 to 4 hours average for anyone to finish this game."
,Recommended,423590,28361097,"Posted: 14 December, 2016",all,Uncle Dad Touch,"This is a charming, immersive little point and click adventure game that's well worth checking out. The art design and animation are the clear champions here, with so many small details and adorable interactions that really help endear you.This is developed by a small Irish team, and it shows in both positive and negative ways.The story and world really feel like an Irish themed Disney movie, with lush visuals and fun characters. Especially impressive is the characterisation of animals, which show up a lot. All of them have their own personality and quirks, and this is all shown without them saying a single word. The colour palette is also bright and cheery, both in the human and fantasy worlds. I basically had a smile on my face the whole way through, and while the writing rarely had me in stitches, I chuckled enough to keep me happy.Then looking at the other side of things, this game is very rough around the edges. It's short, which is understandable considering the amount of animation work put in and the team size. Personally I had no problem with this; but if you're someone who buys games while weighing cost to length I'd plop this in the wishlist and buy it on sale.I also encountered a few minor bugs while playing, but they didn't disrupt play too much aside from one that forced me to quit and load back in. The artwork, while gorgeous, has some slight scaling issues with certain objects or characters being crisp in a slightly blurry background. It doesn't happen too much, but when it does it can bee a little jarring.Again, none of these were major problems, and the style and charm of the game helped brush these over for the mostpart. The puzzles are straightforward, which is part of the reason it's short. Most of them can be figured out with a little thinking, and I never felt myself reaching for a walkthrough. There's also a hint system, which going along with the general style of the game, makes this an absolutely perfect game to play with your kid.The story is one of the unfortunate letdowns of the game. The characters and writing is all pretty good, but the plot itself feels a combination of simplistic and confusing. By the end of the game, there are a lot of important questions unanswered, and plot elements seemingly set up that are never followed up on. It ends abruptly, and feels like there were some scenes missing or cut from the game that might have made things a bit more coherent.Despite all these gripes, I can't help but really adore this game. It's rare I see a game bleed so much charm that it almost seems to render any critical analysis pointless. No matter how I break it down in my head, I found myself having an unconditional, dog-like love for it. Speaking of which, the dog is worth the price of admission alone. Best videogame dog of 2016."

The whole experience is very smooth and I haven't had any major problems with the puzzles which I liked.The story is nice and switching between 2 playable characters adds variety. The game has fully voice acting which can be a hit or miss sometimes but in here it fortunatelly works great. The 2D animations are gorgeous and definitely are the selling point in here. So if you like nice art, 2D traditional animations, good story, nice characters I definitelly encourage you to pick this one up. Very pleasent experience and good time with the game. As a point and click game I give it 9/10.Very well done."

Best of all, it dodges the dull dead doggy dilemma.This is a game that's willing to be serious and humorous one after another and even simultaneously, and it works quite well! The story, of a father looking for his own father when his daughter follows him to somewhere neither should be, had plenty of work put into it!Of course, if you seek challenge, best look elsewhere. The only ""puzzle"" I needed help with all game was when I went in a window and failed to realize that I had to leave through another window without doing a single thing.Looking forward to future projects by the same developers!"

I found the insane items combos and convoluted, often unintuitive puzzle solutions to be a real wet towel on the enjoyment of what were usually otherwise very funny and heart-warming games.The Little Acre does away with a lot of nonsense, and retains the heart and humour, which is a winning combination.Every frame of the game and every animation is hand-drawn which is amazing to see (and makes me completely okay with the fact that the game is a little short) and is very reminiscent of the 50s era Disney cartoons. The amount of detail in the scenes and animations makes it a really enjoyable and rich experience while it lasts, and the price is certainly matched to the quality. Great value for money, in fact!The little girl, Lilly, is an adorable character, and you alternate between playing as her and her dad. You sometimes come through an area after the dad does, and it's hilarious to see how differently they view the same items in the world too.Some of the voice acting could have been a little stronger, but it's not bad (Lilly's is great, and she's the main character), and the sounds and music are brilliant!All in all it's well worth the money for a chilled out, funny, heart-warming adventure game to spend a long evening with."

,Recommended,423590,31067839,Posted: 10 April,all,Sofox,"A beautifuly animated and charming tale, though admittedly short.It's clear that the developers set out for an epic game on scale with a great Don Bluth animation, and seem to have had to compromise on game lenght in order to maintiain the quality.Set in rural Ireland, you control a pretty normal Irishman and his hilarious six year old daughter as they find themselves getting caught up in a relative's invention that ends up teleporting them to another world. Figuring out how to work the inventions, navigating the new world, and getting the two characters communicating with eachother represent the bulk of the challenges, though as they do so they also get a sense of hidden danger lurking in the new world that the grandfather also seems to have encountered.It's lightly challenging but not frustrating and it does feel like an adventure although you may wish there was more to it. For being so unique and clearly a labour of love, I give it a high recommendation."

And I sat through every minute of it thinking it might be some kind of credits-before-the-game-like-Monkey-Island-type-thing. What there is of the game is faultless (aside from the worst voice actor of any game ever going to whatever twit thought they could play the villain (no spoilers, because it's not at ALL obvious who the villains is... is it. Hmm.)... but that's just it. What there is of it. This is NOT a game. This is a demo, regardless of what it's billed as. And until the studio that made it fleshes out all the thousands of loose ends they left dangling after 'lovingly crafting' the initial strings it can be left on the shelf without a second thought.

Gameplay-wise, this is standard advnture game fare, with the puzzles all having logical solutions (a good thing!) that can reasonably resolved without too much head-scratching.Which brings me to my one real complaint: this is a very short game, easily completed within a couple of hours.  It would have been nice if there had been a bit more to it, especially as it creates an interesting world.  After I had completed it, I found myself wanting to know more about the characters and the story that are introduced.

The story is.... dare I say cute. Nothing super dramatic but it's much like a fairy tale, or a flight of fancy a child may have while playing out side. Where is game truly shines is the sound production. Everything from the wonderful voice acting, to the beautiful music. It's art is a very fluid traditional style where it manages to help bring the characters and world to life. almost everything seemed to have just enough animation to it to bring the world to color. The characters themselves while at first seem bland, actually have a pretty thuro depth to them despite never really learning much about them.The biggest down side has been stated, in that it's very short. there's nothing really in the way of multiple ways of doing things so, sadly not much in replayability. Many of the puzzles are simple to solve and if you are having trouble with anything the hints make things bluntly obvious.

It only took 83 minutes for me to complete, and it just felt like there were a few things that were compressed in the story. Some of the side characters felt like they got very little play time in the story and could have flushed out their parts a bit. The antagonist felt short as well and left a lot of holes that felt like they should be filled. Is it a fun, cute indy game? Yes! I did enjoy it. Artwork was excellent and the animation was smooth. A good chunk of it gave that classic kids cartoon animation vibe and I loved it. Felt like a story from your childhood without being childish. A tiny bit pricy for the amount of time and I would have loved to see it flushed out to its full potential. To me, this is a starting point, half the novel is here, needs some more oompf added. Loved it all the same, 7.5/10. Would get full 10 with more story."

,Recommended,423590,28972093,Posted: 3 January,all,Werepuppy,"I got to play the demo at EGX and I was so excited to play it. I have a love for hand drawn animation having grown up with that era, and Pewter Games have done a great job in bringing this game to life.Getting to play the full version, I loved every moment, but when I got to the end and the credits rolled... ""That's it?!""It was way way too short for what I was expecting, the demo I played at EGX accounts for around 1/3 of the game. The final animations also felt a bit unfinished and rough; which I was understandable when playing the demo, but did not expect it to be left like that for the released version.I am a huge fan of point n click adventures, so would still heavily recommend it to any of my friends, but would advise they wait until it's around the £5 mark as I would not rate it worth more than that for the content played."
,Recommended,423590,28974142,Posted: 3 January,all,Akuni,"Played through the game and have to say it's quite good. However, as others have noted, it's quite ""rough at the edges"" for some parts. Fair warning, there might be small spoilers ahead!Since I grew up with Daedalic games I've seen quite some different drawing styles. However, Daedalic always pays attention to wrap it all up - No matter if the style is hand drawn and scanned, drawn on a tablet or rendered: It looks like a package where everything fits together. With this game there are several different styles from scribbles (the cat for example) to the fully fleshed out style of Clonfira but nothing to really piece it together. Playing especially the Non-Clonfira passages felt rough as that's in my opinion the places where most styles clash together. This is definitely a point which needs some work.Also, the storytelling is rather quick and due to this often feels jumpy and disjointed. Sometimes, it's neccessary to take the time and explain things whole to make sure everyone has time to realize the gravity of the situation. A good example of this is the first meeting with Nina and their conversation: It feels very staged as there is no time for shock or other emotions (directly answers with ""oh my god, no! Let's go!"" for example - She might be quick thinking but that one just felt unnatural). Also that tombstone. Certain someone just walkes through a weird new world and encounters a stone with a name on it. Why does she exactly know what happened there? No one explained it. There's not even a rest in piece inscription. Throughout the game there were several of those small hiccups where I just felt ""thrown out of the story"". The next game should definitely make sure people are sticking to the story 'til the end.The voiceacting was all around pretty awsome, there's not much to criticize here - Everyone was in character and emotions are shown accordingly. However, some samples were a little louder or quieter than the general others. It makes sense if the character is visibly muffled to tone down the voice but looking at two things, in the same room, without much difference in distance should give the same volume.Character design and world building was all around great. No complains at all here. :)So overall? This game is very charming and is a lot of fun to play through. It is rough yes, but I'm positive that the developers can take the lessons learned with this game and push for a great game in the future. I'm looking forward to that! Definitely recommending this game to everyone who loves point and click adventures."

Point and click adventures are my favourite type of game, with the Monkey Island series being my ultimate favourite. I got to play a small section of Little Acre at Arcadecon in Dublin in July 2015, and I enjoyed it then, so I was looking forward to getting to try out the whole thing when it came out on Steam. It was a long wait, but it was worth it. The artwork is fantastic, beautifully drawn. The characters had real charm and there was a sense of humour to them that I really enjoyed, Lily particularly. It was a great game, the plot was great, the puzzles were good too. My only criticism is that it ended too quickly. I wished it were longer, so I could have kept playing! Please make a sequel!!!"

Lilly and Aidan are charming characters and I love the gorgeous art style, animations and music. The puzzles are straightforward but good fun and, although it's a fairly brief experience overall, there are lots of really nice little flourishes that certainly made it worth the modest price. I'd definitely recommend it, and here's hoping for a sequel to expand on the story and gamplay! Really great job all round by the team!"

If you’ve seen or played the old Dragon’s Lair games, then animation style will be familiar to you.Why should you check it out?The art design is very enjoyable and the small little details in the various areas were a nice touch in bringing those places to life. The main characters are a single dad and his daughter whom you take on this adventure to discover what happened to his father, are fun to listen to, especially in the case of the little girl who has a way of reminding us how we may have looked at the world once when we were kids and it was filled with magic and unknown places waiting to be discovered. I found the introduction to this story was very good at leaving quite a bit of mystery, while providing an interesting hook to draw me deeper into the game.I invite you to check out some of the gameplay here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0EEf61-LDcNote:  I did purchase the game when it released and managed to play through the game in just under 2hrs.  Was a fun game and entertaining, super cute and fun for adults and kids alike.  I did have to refer to the hints twice I think and once was because of a bug with the glove.  That was the only bug I ran into in the game and the Devs are already aware of it and looking into the issue.For more game reviews and podcast info:http://www.bammsters.com"

The artwork, in the style of Don Bluth, is fantastic as is the music. The story is short and sweet and very linear. Normallly I prefer an adventure game where puzzles can be sorted out in different orders but in this case, the general lovliness of the game overcame  that problem. The puzzles are not too difficult although I did not get all the achievements yet so some replay is in order! For a first effort, this is a great little game. Do keep in mind, the play time is short, but linger a bit and spend some time enjoying the love put in the game. You'll miss the speed achievement but you can round that up on the next playthrough!"
