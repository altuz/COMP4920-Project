It is like they got a writer from the ""Sakura"" series and choose to hire them to plot an entire game on.Now tell me if this sounds new and original like the ""Ajtilley / Dharker Studios"" is known for or yet another Sakura game...:The game is basically:  ""Two girls that sorta throw themselves at you to bone them, both having far larger boobs than anything reasonable, and with the girls - one of them is a smart girl but a loner while the other one is overly aggressive and into sports and the like.  A story that is weak on a plot and without a real purpose or goal other than to bone the girls in different ways.""Sadly, at least the game has a nude patch but if the ""Sakura"" games did that, they would be utter clones and this game is not original at all.  I guess like the Pixar movie ""Cars 2"", every company will produce a full out dud and this game will be remembered as the ""Dharker Studios - Cars 2"" is all.Even knowing I don't hate this game, I won't probably walk blindly into a ""Prepurchase"" again for Dharker Studios is all.  If we wanted to play a stupid and 'simple minded jock' targetted game, we would just play the ""Sakura"" game series again.  This company is capable of so much better and it would be nice to see them go back to producing Quality over Quantity in the future.----------------------------------UPDATE:  I fast forward through to see the end and it even finishes as I suspected all along.  I plead with whoever reads this to ask for a refund as well.  Hopefully from the lack of sales, Dharker Studios won't pull this ""Sakura"" garbage on us again in the future."

,Not Recommended,423650,25217779,"Posted: 28 August, 2016",all,✩ Helenα ✩,"Definitely not worth paying the full price; this game is really short, with only 2 girls to choose (plus a special harem ending). This VN gives a weird vibe that it was like the first work of a developer team. And I know it’s not their first work, so that’s kinda confusing? I don’t know, they surely have made better VNs than this one.I read that they’re planning on making a remastered edition of this game, and I wish them luck! Hopefully the final product will be better than this one. But unfortunately, for how this game is right now, I cannot recommend it.2/10."

I mean, i know there's always one losing, but did you really have to show this to the gamer? I couldn't continue to play this game, i don't want anyone to be sad because of me ._."

While I do recommend it, I only think it's worthwhile if you catch it very very cheap.Pros:+ Decent short story++ Uncensored fix available in the community (courtesy of me), no download necessary!+ The tiddies are quite big in this one, might be a con if you prefer them small I guess...++ Trading cards AND fairly easy achievements (with community guide available if you get stuck!)Cons:- Not worth retail, pick it up on sale.Play similar games?

76561198069159152,Recommended,423650,30990941,Posted: 6 April,all,wrb41977,"This is a short visual novel that involves you inviting two friends to your family's lake house for a weekend. You can be interested in either of them (at first), and perhaps start a relationship with your choice. After completing one of the girl's good endings, you can do a runthrough where you can decide to pursue both.Fun, good looking CGs (and trading cards) and a set of easy achievements (the bad endings can be harder to get than the good ones)."
76561197981356193,Recommended,423650,29992053,Posted: 17 February,all,fatcoland,"Summer Fling is an erotic visual novel released from Dharker Studios.  If you are familiar with DS, you can expect the same recycled artwork from previous and future titles.  This isn't meant to be positive or negative, just an expectation.  There is also an uncensored patch available on Dharker Studios website at the time of this review release.  With the patch, you can expect to see mostly upper female anatomy in more detail.  No full frontal.The plot and storyline are paper thin.  They did put in a little more effort for aftermath in the multiple endings, but still felt had little to no illustration to character development.  The erotic language was graphic in detail, but was barely par compared to most mainstream erotic literature.  Thankfully, it is much more detailed than the actual story.  The ambience would have been much greater if they had more illustrations to accompany the erotic detail.  Instead, we get about five erotic images per scene, most which are variations of the same image.I read all of the dialog offered in about an hour.  The whole game reads like it was a part of a bigger story at one point.  Obviously price is relevant to the buyer, but I would recommend buying it as part of a bundle package.  Personally, the $10 MSRP is way overinflated.  I'd recommend buying it for ~$1, just for the sake of supporting the developer."

Club Life involved picking two school clubs at the beginning to join, which would then lead you into meeting girls that you can end up with. While with Summer Fling, you run into two best friends, who you invite to spend a weekend with at your family's beach house, and possibly get together with.Not really sure if both games had the same writer, but the writing style seemed different. Might be because of the different scenario, I don't know, though I found that I liked the characters in Club Life more.I think the art was better too, at least when it came to the shape of the chin. Though both games shared a similiarity in that I can't get the last ending alone without a proper walkthrough. Seeing all the negative reviews though, most of which seem to complain about the lack of voice acting, which I think is irrelevant, I doubt that's likely.In spite of those reviews, I bought the game anyway, since I do like the games Dharker Studios produce, and do plan on still keeping this. But while Club Life didn't really tie up all it's loose ends, while this game had, it was fitting, and I still feel had a better plot then this. The writer did do a good job at writing a third wheel though.I just wish I could get some help on getting that threesome ending, even though the game has about only three or four nudes to really use as private 'material', not even counting the possibility of this threesome ending having nudes."

Without the uncensored patch, and wanting to see some H-scenes I don't recommend getting this. It is quite short for a Dharker Studios game, with a lack of characters, but what was there was good.I enjoy Dharker studio games so I knew what I was getting into, and this one was... okay.I don't think this was there best, I expected more from Dharker Studios, but while waiting for there bigger releases later this was fine. I recommend getting it on sale though because it's pretty short."
