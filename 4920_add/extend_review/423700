76561198119503580,Not Recommended,423700,29504128,Posted: 26 January,all,Norinia,"Okay, I will admit that I wanted to like this game. And honestly, The core of the game was fun. Its just that it was extremely broken. The Devs need to go back and fix the Frame Rate and the Crashes. And honestly, they need to make the game less confusing. The game may say you need to go to this location, but the game is so spread out there is no knowing where that location is.I finally had to request a refund when I couldn't figure out where the hotel was on my own. I stumbled into quest blind, not completely knowing why I was there. The controls for driving aren't laid out, and when I say that, I don't mean 'oh I don't know how to turn left and right' because that wasn't an issue. The issue was I couldn't get out of my vehicle on my own without a random quest being there. Since I'm sure there would be a point where there are no location quest but you have to get food for the hotel, that is a serious issue.The Frame Rate wasn't imposible, I'll say that. But it was slow enough that if I wasn't on my tactical game, zombies would easily come and munch me like a bag of chips. There are many players who would have flipped out faster and gotten themselves killed with that frame rate, So that despreately needs to be fixed.As for crashes, I only dealt with one before I requested a refund. I was in the middle of a hoard of monsters (not completely sure they were zombies) and I needed to change off my shotgun because I had like 3-4 shots left in it. So I press the convient O button to swap to my chainsaw. The game couldn't have crashed faster. I've read below that there were many more crashes in the game so I didn't put up with it.Alright, so why the heck did I buy a game with nearly no positive reviews to it?I really wanted to like this game. I am obsessed with apocalyptic and survival games, as any of my friends they'll tell you the same. So when I saw this, I got excited.I really like the mechanic where you constantly have to forge for food. I love how you craft weapons, ammo, hotel supplies, and food. I think that is amazing and the things on those list aren't really easy to get. Very fun for hardcore survivalist like me.I really like how in the beginning the devs give you plenty of ammo to help you get the learning curve. You essentially have no fear of running out of ammo in the beginning, with over 70-100 shots of shotgun ammo, around 200-250 pistol ammo, and 250 chainsaw fuel (I sadly never got to try out the chainsaw as mentioned above when I attempted) the weapons you start with are not top notch. It is a rusty pistol and shotgun. Still they are extremely helpful in the beginning when you are clearing out zombies from the hotel and maybe a couple missions before you actually have to start crafting ammo.The hotel was pretty nice, for an apocalypse hotel. There were so many issues in the hotel to fix that I got excited, thinking of the time I could have soon fixing up the hotel into a 5 star joint.Since many of you won't play this, I'll say this, Bruno is the most helpful companion in the game, my opinion. He'll charge zombies, bitting them to death taking almost no damage whatsoever. Very useful with the low frame rate, he'll keep you from being instantly swarmed when you load up the map.I guess in conclusion, This game would have been amazing. I'm not biased against it. But these errors were right at the start of the game. I had hardly finished my first mission when all this sadly came to a head. I wanted to love this game, But unless the Devs fix these bugs and add in location markers to help players get to places, This game will never gain positive ratings.One last thing before I go, Only play one day and night to see how it goes for you. The Devs do not give you a time skip button, and at one point try to 'recommend' you to wait it out until morning. Do Not Do This. There is no time skip button, so you are forced to sit there waiting for day to come slowly, which will Wear Down your steam time until the point where Steam will look at your time card when you go to request a refund for it, and they will think you a liar and deny you. Don't get caught in it. Keep to one day and one night to see if you actually like the game."

The bug would not let me play even one random mission without crashing. Unless they patch I dont recomend a purchase.
,Not Recommended,423700,28515032,"Posted: 21 December, 2016",all,HubertGunderson,"Not worth it. Neat game, interesting concept, fun to play, but game crashes due to persistant error about every 10-20 minutes. This, combined with the fact that you can't save except at the end of missions or when back at the hotel, makes it impossibly frustrating to play. Devs no longer supporting the game. Waste of money."

The premise is fantasticly fun and what little I got to play was great. But constant crashing and less than 10 frame per second playspeed just made it intolerable.

But it often crashes espiceally since the last update and the developer has no responded to anyones complaints. I've past the point where I personally could get my money back a long time ago. So warning about this before anyone else wastes their money."

,Recommended,423700,20769786,"Posted: 26 January, 2016",all,the elk,"I've played and enjoyed the other 2 games that this dev has put out and I'm so glad I've stuck with them to get to Apocalypse Hotel! I'm not a massive zombie fan generally, and it's creepy as hell fighting these guys at night, but I'm already too in love with what I've seen of the world and the species in it to give in to my fears! Being mobbed by loads of zombies by torchlight is super scary, almost as scary as the decor in some parts of the hotel itself! Haha! But I've upgraded some rooms and I'm making it work. It's retro!Anyway, I'm going to go back to playing now, but I'm loving the interplay between aliens, zombies, mutants, and humans - it's a totally refreshing take on this genre and I can't wait to get further into the plot! Running smoothly on my not overly-fantastic laptop as well, so yay!"

For example when you are trying to change direction then shoot the character will still be in the original direction.The screen frame rate should improve.The game has potential but these should improve before I would recommend people buying it.

In that short time I've been in zombie fights, run out of ammo and had to use my chainsaw, crashed my car, looted so many random items, and crafted some more bullets.... phew.Looks good so far and I'll update as I play.  I've played other games by these devs and liked those but it seems they've gone up a level with this game."

Given the game limits saving, this makes it unplayable and the developers have moved onto other projects and showed no interest in fixing this in over a year."

76561198010127431,Recommended,423700,29283258,Posted: 15 January,all,Oshkell,"I like this game.  I really do.But it is really quite buggy.  Every now and then, the game crashes because of one error message or another, which suggests to me that the level of playtesting involved is inadequate.  It wouldn't be quite so bad if you could save wherever you pleased, but the old fashioned ""save point"" method makes it pretty frustrating.If you can get past the bugs, I certainly recommend this game.  Don't let the RPG-maker graphics fool you - it's pretty good.  You upgrade your hotel in a manner that vaguely reminds me of how you upgrade your castle in Suikoden II, and you get to pick and choose to whom you rent.  The different guests offer different services, and there always seems like a LOT to do.  Even the little sidequests, which come and go faster than you can do them all, seem pretty important.  The game has more of a plot than its simplistic writing style would suggest, and the level of inventory management involved appeals to me.If you can pick it up on sale, it's probably a steal.  I could only recommend it at its list price if the bugs were ironed out."

Despite an apocalypse going on.There is plenty of fixing and crafting to do.  I have only played it for awhile so i havent gotten too far in. but so far im feeling good about it. Exept for the sprite bug (with can be avoided by making sure your companion isnt in combat while trying to exit the area). Would i recommend it? both yes and no. At a sale yes. After they fixed bugs i would recommend it none the less."

A top down hotel building, zombie slaying, alien wrecking game!!Only a few bugs that I have noticed. All in all its a fun game. Just when you think it is starting to get repetitive a random guest shows up at your hotel.Big con!!- Is that its very easy to shoot your z-dog when fighting a hoard of z's, then the dog is gone the rest of you trip which is a shame because he really does help!"
