,Not Recommended,423710,19487301,"Posted: 4 December, 2015",all,Frogge,"This is not a bad game, but in it's current state, don't buy it.First of all, I know what you are thinking, ''It's early access you can't expect it to be perfect!'' and I hear you, but to let you people know, this is more of a debug build than an early access. It could have been released as a free demo, because in it's current state, it's not something that should be commercial.Let's start from the very beginningAt the start of the game, you are thrown straight into the game where you name your character. No title screen, no splash screen. Nothing. You just straight up get thrown in, however, after saving there IS a title screen.One problem I had is, except when I did it the first time, I get thrown into a map where I am stuck on a bunch of barrels and can't move everytime I start a new game. Holding shift also skips text which I appreciate but also don't. It's really annoying trying to read a tutorial but then accidentally pressing shift and skipping it all. Also the food you get never runs out. If you get hungry you can just go to your menu and keep choosing the tin of beans, it will not disappear at all.I'm outside!One problem I really had with the exteriors is it's so hard to tell where you are going. You can't tell where the borders are and you just get teleported to a new area out of nowhere. About gathering party members, I didn't like this system much either. They are just randomly lying around and they join you immediately if you just tell them to. I hope that in the final version maybe they will not be in areas filled with zombies(who stands around in the middle of all those zombies?)and maybe you will need to gain their trust first, by doing something like a sidequest. Also there are no loots around at all. I feel like more loots and some more weapons could be added. I like the idea of getting attacked by large hordes of zombies. They are easy to escape at times, however one thing that's really bothering me is how easy they are to kill. All you have to do is keep smashing space-bar, they are no challenge at all. The only way they can kill you is if you are alone. With party members you are like indestructible. Maps are ok, they are not bad but they are a little too much stacked together. Your battle system also gets buggy when you get more than 4 party members. I can see that the developer wanted to make it so that if one person dies the other will fight instead, but the enemies are so easy to defeat, so something like that won't be happening anytime soon.I feel that this game has a lot of potential but it needs polishing. I am sure the final version will be better, but the early access version just isn't worth buying. It's nothing that stands out too much. It won't keep you thrilled, it isn't full of fun, but it has potential. Just, wait for it to get some updates first.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvqD3XbQIVg"
,Recommended,423710,19454684,"Posted: 3 December, 2015",all,Mario,"It's a good start and I like where this zombie JRPG is going, can't wait for it to be expanded on. Although there are quite a few bugs that will hopefully be fixed/improved on in the full version.-You can't reach the guy in the blue cap due to the bench and rocks blocking the way, so you can't recruit him.-You're more than likely to accidentally travel screens due to the border not being visible.-There's certain spots when travelling screens, where you would get stuck on an object upon changing screens.-Loot and survivors aren't randomised, they'll always be found in the same spot.-No options, needed to lower the volume and couldn't. Button mapping would be great as well.-The only warning you get for your hunger is the hunger bar, I had forgotten about it at one point and my character exclaimed ""I'm so hungry"", then proceeded to die instantly. (A pre-warning could of helped)"
76561198005271335,Not Recommended,423710,20250918,"Posted: 3 January, 2016",all,Pale Dolphin,"So I've spent some time playing this game, and -- well, what can I say, JRPGs and survival don't mix well.This game is basically a product of RPG Maker or a similar software, with some tweaks towards making it a ""survival"" game (gosh, we don't have enought survival games as is, now do we?). And while the concept may have it's potential, this game certainly has none. With the current gameplay, all it basically does is mixing the screens randomly, hoping for something good to magically happen in the process (spoiler alert: it doesn't).The battle system is dull and boring -- if you've ever played a JRPG, you know how it works. The battles are turn-based, turns are determined by ATB gauge. You can perform one action per turn: attack, defend, use an item, use a technique (aka ""special"" attack), which consumses your ""mana"" (at the moment, I couldn't find a way to replenish it, by the way).The storyline is entirely missing. You have your 10-seconds tutorial, telling you that you're immune to... a pathogen? Well, there's that. And this is all you need to know, evidently.Also, the game is *really* buggy -- enemies are glitching (the ""werecar"" monster is just terrible at passing stuff), decorations are glitching, your character is glitching and sometimes stucking irreversibly in obstacles... I mean, sure, this is an Early Access product, but come on, can you do *some* beta-testing before releasing the game?All in all, this is a very, very wonky game with foggy outlook. I'd rate it3.5 out of 10.0, and I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy it, as of now.(If the game develops any further, I might change this review later on)- - - - - - - -Yup, RPG Maker confirmed: game uses ""Horror City"" DLC for RPG Maker VX, so no original art is coming your way here either. I'm changing my rating from 3.5 to 1.0 out of 10.0."

I used an xbox360 controller, which worked fine (buttons X to select, B to backout).  Make sure you find and equip yourself with a weapon quickly.  There isn't a lot of text, so it didn't strain my eyes.  It was fun, I died and restarted a few times, and I got the hang of it.  But that's when the fun halted.  I'm not sure I understand what I am supposed to be doing in this game.  I avoid zombies, fight a few, find a rare healthkit or weapon or two, run out of medkits and die.  There doesn't seem to be anywhere really to go or do beyond repeat this avoid, fight-a-few, and eventually die.  I got 30 minutes of fun, then confused.This is early access.  First 30 minutes was 4/5 stars, then 1/5 stars after if that was all there was."

I bought it a long time ago on Early Access stage, and yeah, what should I say?I really got into the game. Even though it didn't have much of a story, I liked the hints they gave on it. Same with the characters. They didn't have much to say, but I found myself quite addicted to them. So I was looking forward to the future development of the game, I wanted to know more about the story and it's background. And I was confident, the game would provide me of it with further development.But I was so wrong. The last update was in April. Nothing changes since then... but the fact, it left Early Access. I wonder why? They didn't do anything with the game. There is still no story, no goal... and even worse, nothing has been done about the known bugs. You can't buy anything, even if you collect scraps, the games currency. You can't even fill up your AP, which means once you used up the initial AP, you're screwed.So even though it makes me sad, I can't recommend this game to anyone. It's not really a game.. It's something that could have become an amazing game... but was dropped and left in an unplayable state."

But the only reason I played for as long as I did was to try and get the achievements. However, this game isn't worth going the extra mile for a couple reasons:-No apparent way to restore AP-Scrap serves no purpose (Why have it?)-Dead characters can be found again through Re-Roll, but join your party dead-Enemies still move around when text boxes are up-Only way to get to certain places/characters is by using ghost skull-Kill count doesnt carry over on re-rollThis woundn't matter so much if character health/ap regenerated on re-roll or dead characters could be picked up again after re-roll at full health, but it makes trying to get achievements just an annoying chore instead of a fun milestone.I do like a couple things+Items, party members and exp carry over on re-roll+Use of hunger as survival mechanism makes it more engaging+Humor. Because I'm trying really hard to make some good points.+Oh, and you get Trading cards. Basically the reason I played it at all.Final appraisal: Don't buy as is.

,Not Recommended,423710,21122510,"Posted: 11 February, 2016",all,Chernobog,"Currently, the game is very rough. It's extremely simple to get wiped out early on if you get a bad string of luck where you can't find any companions. You can, however, have a full group of six running around. You'll need them to tackle the heavy amount of wandering hordes hunting you down (to say nothing of a 'were-car'). On your own, your life expectancy might be a few minutes at best. Characters are individually quite weak- you must search the city to find people and perhaps a little equipment, although the game is very thin on the latter right now.There's no goal at this time, other than just to survive as long as you can. If you can manage long enough, you can reroll the maps to a new area with your levels and companions. Additionally, the zombies also level (and rather quickly, too).Again, this might not sound like much, but there's an interesting idea and an experience here. I want to see Invasion turn into more of an in depth zombie survival rpg experience, with a goal and nuances. Maybe that won't happen. I suppose we'll see. So you might want to hold off until there's more of a game under the hood, but with the extremely low price, you probably won't be hurting just to try for the challenge and experience of the concept.At this time, the game is rather buggy and crude. There seems to be a little too much emphasis on references and quips, which didn't really work for me, as well. Characters could stand to have more abilities and personality. And to really flesh out the zombie survival experience, the game needs far more equipment.This used to be a Recommended review, as I cited there was potential here. But the developer doesn't seem to be doing much of anything with this title. As of this writing, he hasn't updated any meaningful content and the developer has gone silent on the forums. By itself, the game is overly limited even for an Early Access. Not sure why the title is seemingly being ignored into a state of barely functioning limbo, but I can't in good conscience recommend it, even for a dollar's value. It's one of those greenlit titles that has a kernal of a good idea in it, but it apparently isn't being helmed by anyone willing to make it work."

It does not pretend to be the new and improved Resident Evil. Even taking the above into account, I can't recommend this game at all.On the plus side, it does have some graphical customisation and an extremely corny intro. Oh, and some ideas have been tried.On the minus side? Where to even begin? You'll need to reboot/keybash to get it to play in fullscreen and forget about using a controller as the controls are... iffy at best. All challenge vanishes from battles as you get guns and recruit party members. At least until you hit the bugged were-car miniboss battle. Once the 'boss' does run-over, you are dead, but you can't hit him properly due to a large number of Blank Slate invisible enemies and zombies also in the battle.Area transition is atrocious, you end up in trees more often than not, movement is constricted and some buildings let you walk all over them. The environments do not feel like a real urban environment, more like a box fort. The music, such as there is, borrows heavily from other games. In addition to these points, you are also hampered by a hunger bar. For the entire party one hunger bar. IT DOES NOT ADD TO THE FUN, being a boring chore.In short, avoid this game like a zombie-apocalypse. Even at 80+% discounts."

I'm now sharing these notes with you to help you patch up and see how a new player experiences your game. Spoilers may be present for those thinking about getting this game, but in this stage I don't think spoilers are possible, nevertheless this is mostly for the developer. Warning: this will be lengthy, but hopefully helpful.Gameplay NotesCombat gets dull, ZZ, wait a sec, ZZ, wait a sec, etc. (but then again it's early-game)When do I get techniques? Why don't I start with a simple one?? Even the zombies get ""Endure6"" or whatever it says (what does that say? and what does it do? I'm very curious)Real-time should stop when you're trying to read or just picked something up: I picked up a health pack and then got attacked by a swarm because I couldn't grab and runKilled a huge swarm in front of a store because I figured I could go into it, but it's not even interactiveTook me about 30 minutes total of aimlessly wondering and fighting to find first survivorWhy doesn't food for hunger also replenish health? It's food...First survivor I find is at least 4x stronger than me, not a problem just strangeActually really cool that you can die and then just continue as a survivorGets hard too fast, only seen one survivor, no store no other NPCs, nothing, and it's already like my last standMovement's too slow and stiff for a real-time game where you have to avoid zombiesImpassable objects hidden behind buildingsNo way to tell which survivor is attacking, or if there is it's super subtleToo many zombies right off the bat, the game needs a difficulty progression, and it starts with getting swarmed by 20 zombies a screen, it's just too muchStraight up don't understand the hunger bar, does it get smaller the hungrier I am? If so, how do I know just HOW small it is compared to how big it could be?The only part that feels like an actual game is the very beginning, with the dialogue, secret health pack, and scripted zombie attack. Once I leave the building I feel like I'm stuck in limbo between what I just did and the next story point/NPC/etc., only problem is the next action never comes. I found a newspaper that talked about the emergence of the zombies, which was neat, but only unique discovery I've found thus far aside from the survivorsIs the Tiger Defence Academy bit designed purposefully so I get attacked while reading it??Survivor's just have like a one-liner, then start following you around. Why not some back-and-forths or something?I would've said the Shotgun's technique that shoots every enemy is OP considering it has barely any damage reduction as opposed to just shooting one enemy, but then again the swarm one shot me anyway because each zombie hit's around 100, there were at least 10 of them, and I had 500 health max, but like 250 at the timeIn the entire time I've played this I've only found one other building to go intoAesthetic NotesNicely decorated but for gameplay's sake perhaps too decorated? Or be able to pass through more thingsTakes a second to distinguish character from zombies, and in a game where screen is changing alot and it spawns you not always right on the edge of the new screen, I can loose the character briefly which is not good in a zombie gameThere's a zombie type that looks almost exactly like the survivor Peach but with her arms out: it's confusingNeedless to say that stock effects/graphics/sounds were used, which is very unappealing in the long-run: there's SO many RPGmaker games out there today, it's clear that the ones that are fully customized and no longer look or sound like RPGmaker are the ones that are successfulTechnical NotesCan't minimize game without it breakingStarting the game flashes the screen fullscreen back to windowed repeatedly for a minuteMy hunger went down even though we couldn't open the Tin 'O Beans (but then jumped way back up a minute later??)Enemies respawn way too quickly, I leave screen and come back and they're back, what if I left screen on accident? There goes all my progressNear the park there's some car that seems like it's franticly trying to run me over but can never succeed even if it's directly on top of me; it follows me to neighboring screensApparently if you hit Z you can fight this (zombie?) car. It looks super glitchy and this is probably a bug what I'm seeing; I targeted it and I shot the pond behind it, and it's name was all messed up but I can't check what it was since it one-shot me (like I said, difficulty is insane for this early in a game)Why can't you walk over bushes?DO NOT HIT F12 ANYONE. For some reason it immediately quits without saving...The combat system is strange, I like it because it's different but much more thought should be put into it to balance it out and make it a bit more concrete, I'm mostly talking about the fact that you don't necessarily take turns, but you just wait for your ATB to fill up, then you make an actionIt was still raining inside a buildingWhenever I try to ""Shutdown"" the game from the menu, the correct way, it goes unresponsive, a window comes up saying so and I have to tell it to give up trying to recover...Overall, I like this game, it has tons of flaws and I found a bunch of tiny knit-picky problems with it but that's what Early Access is for. I hope to see this game improve consistently and look forward to the official release! Hope I helped, have a great day."

Doing screenshot end with the game crashing (both f12 or prtscreen button)2, I seem to be unable to walk out the doors unless i back up an then go straight forward.3 its not possible to play the game in window mode (no options to choose).That being said; its an ok game considering it was 90% off and i get tradingcards. I found it amusing that there where some sci-fi referances like Doc-Brown in it. Gameplay like Final Fantasy 6 with zombies (this game is waaaay shorter)"

,Recommended,423710,22900830,"Posted: 10 May, 2016",all,Ninja™,"When I first bought the game it was not very great. But now that the developer has spent time updating the game (and I would really enjoy it if development continued), I actually like the game because of many reason (my opinions). I am huge in to zombie games such as CS:NZ, L4D2, Zombie Panic Source!, etc. and when I played this game I found that it promots cooperation. The key feature in a fun zombie game is when you have fun playing it, this game currently does not have a lot of places to go but I believe in time Invasion: Brain Craving will be a really awesome game. Another reason it is good is that it is balenced in gameplay, the zombies are not to easy and not to hard and there is the right amount of zombies in each area. Now let me point out a few things that I do not like then go over them at the end :) First: Only two enterable buildings (only one has loot). Two: Not really any items added in besides cans of beans and health packs. Three: Can not see zombies when moving behind buildings. Four: Not a lot of areas to go to and there not progressive in difficulty (besides the area with the werecar). And Fifth: I really would like to see if the developer does want to continue updating this game, if so I will play the game a whole lot and tell my friends about. Conclution - I suck at writting reviews but I enjoy this game as a person who loves zombie games and I will continue to play it ever update."

76561198026447716,Not Recommended,423710,26563085,"Posted: 12 November, 2016",all,osherono,"Got this as part of a steam bundle. Would not recommend at any price.Lets see:- Active time battles? As in wait for your timer to fill then pray your attack hits the zombie before they all kill you in a multi hit combo (see next line).- Any zombie nearby enters the battle when you touch one zombie. Yes, this is ""realistic"" I figure. However, given that the game gives you no incentive to play (I only played it to see what it ws about after getting the bundle, then quickly lost interest after 1 minute) and the fact that a group of 3-4 zombies can end your game less than 5 minutes of starting it, its no good.- No incentive whatsoever to play. This is worst thing a game developer (or aspiring one) can do. Making it challenging and making it so that the player just does something else are two different things.- Bad map design. Whenever I read randomized, I ten to just read an eyebrow. I mean eventually things just tend to be variations of a set of rules rather than really randomized. In any case, this game would hve benefited of some actual scripting and writing and true map design rather than the developper being lazy and going for arbitrary rules just because  it seemed map design was too much of a hassle (that is the impression I got).This game feels like a school or university assignment that the student got bored halfway through, then decided to release it just to see how mch money he could get out of it. This highlights the need for some sort of QA on steam before indie games get released on steam.Again, NOT recommended even if it were free."
