,Recommended,423770,20460179,"Posted: 10 January, 2016",all,genoforprez,"A pretty decent homage to Harvest Moon and the closest thing to a true Harvest Moon type game I have seen on Steam so far. (EDIT: This review was posted before Stardew Valley existed which, if I'm being totally honest, is 10,000 better than this game and you should buy that game first.) If you've played the Harvest Moon games, you more or less know what to expect since there are a lot of similarities, but there are some very signicant differences that Harvest Moon enthusiasts will want to prepare themselves for going in:Some of the major differences include a total lack of seasons, months, or days of the week. It is a land of infinite summer, where each successive day is just one more day. In some ways this is disappointing, since the changing months and seasons of Harvest Moon tend to keep the world feeling fresh for longer, but in other ways it's sort of liberating, since---for example---you don't have to worry about how soon the season change is coming in regard to planting/harvesting. You just plant and harvest without any concern for losing the crops.Our Love Will Grow is very liberating in other ways as well. In Havest Moon you have limited inventory space, but in this game you have infinite pockets, so you don't have to worry about the size of your backpack or upgrading your shelf space. You are a walking Mary Poppins bag, so pick up as many things as you want! Another thing that's liberating compared to Harvest Moon is that you don't have to tediously select which tool to use, running the risk of swinging your pickaxe at your horse because you forgot to select the brush or whatever. Instead, you just stand in front of the animal or thing you need to maintain and press the interact button. The proper tool/action will be auto-selected. In the event that there is a sequence of things that need to be done, the game will auto-sequence as well. For example, if you stand in front of a patch of dirt and tap A, the game will automatically till it using the hoe, plant using a seed, then water using the watering can. And all you had to do was tap ""interact""! It's so nice to not have to fiddle with tool selection so much.There is one huge difference with planting/harvesting that I *hated* about this game at first, but in the larger scheme of things I am now kinda on the fence about. In Havest Moon, you have a huge field that is a grid of squares. You can pretty much plant anything on any square in that huge grid. But in Our Love Will Grow, you have a huge field that just has a few squares on it that are specificallly for planting, but you can't use the rest of the field. It's more like farming out of planters than out of the ground. This feels REALLY annoying and arbitrary at first if you are used to Havest Moon, but the longer I played it, the longer I realized that this is also sort of liberating in a way. Whenever I play Harvest Moon games, I have SO many squares on which to plant/harvest, that I get intensely focused on farming and can't bring myself to waste precious hours of my day running around town and doing other things. But since Our Love Will Grow puts a hard limit on how much you can plant (especially in the early game), it really forces you to do more exploring and gathering instead of being an anti-social bean farmer all friggin' day. And hey, maybe that's not so bad.Speaking of exploring, there is definitely more nature to explore in Our Love Will Grow than in the typical Harvest Moon game. It's not the size of a Zelda overworld or anything, but whereas Harvest Moon typically has only 2 or 3 screens that are not town or farm, Our Love Will Grow has two or three times that amount. So it's good that you have more time to get out there and explore. And you'll want to get to know the lay of the land, since---perhaps on a more negative note---the game does not provide you with a map of any kind.There are parties and town events just like in Harvets Moon but thankfully you aren't forced to participate in any half-baked and janky mini-games like in Harvest Moon. You show up, interact with the towns people, there is a judged contest of some kind involving no mini-games, and then you all go home. Nice.Yes, there is the usual wooing of girls to take as a wife. Sorry, female players, but there is unfortunately (and perhaps unsurprisingly) no option to play as a girl who woos boys instead.There are only two significant criticisms of this game for me:1) Collision checks are huge and bizarre.There are huge collision rectangles around everything and--even worse--there are invisible collision walls drawn in some places where you wouldn't expect them (e.g. you can't walk around the sides of your house, even though it looks like you obviously can). This is definitely not ideal, but it doesn't take long to adjust yourself to it. There are occasional collision errors where you will be seemingly blocked by an invisible wall that was never there before and which disappears if you leave an come back. For example, I once found that I couldn't walk up the path to the mayor's house because something invisible was blocking the whole path. I had to exit the screen and come back. This has happened more than once, in different areas, but is not common. (I expect is has to do with an error in how NPCs teleport around during the day.)2) Poor energy economy.Just like in Harvest Moon, performing actions costs energy. In this game you get an actual energy meter, so your energy is much more quantified than in Harvest Moon, which is good. But what's bad is that Our Love Will Grow docks you energy for a lot of things Harvest Moon doesn't. For example, picking up a mushroom off the ground in the woods costs nothing in Harvest Moon but costs energy in OLWG. Therefore, you run out of energy very quickly in this game. To make matters worse, there is no good way to recover your energy. In harvest moon, you can take a dip in the hot springs or eat some food that you prepared. But in this game, the only way to get any energy back is to buy yourself a snack at the tavern, which costs 100G (in addition to the time expense it takes to walk all the way back to the tavern), and the amount of energy you get for the expense is not really worth it. As a result, the only thing you can really do when your energy runs out is to just call it a day. (And since there are no seasons to worry about, there is no real harm in blowing off a day like this.) This leads to the absolutely ridiculous situations (but which you'll get used to) where you will sometimes wake up at 6am and end up using all your energy and going back to bed by 10am. Such a thing is unthinkable in Harvest Moon, but it will happen regularly in OLWG.Overall, I'd say the game pales in comparison to an actual Harvest Moon game. It's a much more simplified Harvest Moon, which in some ways is good and in some ways not so good. But if you like Harvest Moon, I might recommend this game just for the experience of a game that is MOSTLY like Harvest Moon, but is much different in terms of how the economy and pacing work.7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price.6) A good game that is worth the full price.5) A pretty good game worth checking out--especially if discounted.4) A fairly good game, but I'd recommend buying it discounted.3) Not great, but a few redeeming qualities. Only buy if heavily discounted.2) Only worth checking out if you are dangerously curious.1) Avoid at all costs."

You'll get better game play, more interesting characters/story and a more rewarding experience.However, if you want a simpler, bare bones Harvest Moon-esque experience, I'd reccomend this game.  It pretty much IS Harvest Moon, only much less in depth and with faster progression. It's fine, it's just nothing special and at times feels a bit hollow.Pros:Fast progression, it's easy to accomplish a lot in just a few hours of game play.A decently vast world that adds a bit of exploration  to the gameCons:While the bachelorettes each have a few character traits to make them each unique, there is no way to build relationships with the other NPCs. The bacheloretes frequently have moments that completely kill any charm they had and suck the fun out of courting them. It's also hard to tell when they actually like a gift or not, since there are no facial expressions and their dialogue can be very odd and unclear. ""This is nice. Thanks."" could be taken as earnest, or forced and polite, or sarcastic or passive aggressive. ""WOW! I love you ten percent more now!"" Awesome, I'm not only dating a robot, I'm dating a very shallow robot.There are lots of little things about the game, from the map layout to the menu interface (particularly the inventory system) that are inconveinient and frankly tested my patience. It's the sort of thing where the game isn't taking more time to complete because of a challenge, but because the inventory system is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥A lot of aspects of the game become completely pointless further down the road because you'll run out of things to buy and you're just killing time until you can win the love of your chosen lady, marry her and ""win."""

And I mean hours, at at time... Lovely!Things to note: The game displays in a small window, which can be made to a slightly large wondow, but not full screen. It is keyboard controls only, rather than keyboard and mouse, which took a bit of getting used to (though console controllers are an option). There also appears to be no way to save during a day, so you just have to keep playing! These are all minor things though and just things to be aware of rather than discourage you from purchasing."
,Not Recommended,423770,22529105,"Posted: 19 April, 2016",all,Libby,"Honestly, after playing this for a little while, it's a lot more clunky than most games of the genre/type. The controls are clunkier, the fact that certain things require tools to get and it's automatic instead of organic in nature is a bit annoying.It's an okay game for something made in RPG Maker (yeah, I know the engines quite well having used them for the last, oh, 15+ years) but it was always going to be clunkier than anything made in a more versatile engine. I mean, you could actually make something more like Stardew Valley using RPG Maker but that would require a lot more effort than just making everything automatic based instead.I'm not sure I like this game much, sorry, but eh, I've played a lot worse. It's decent, just the whole lack of feeling like you have any control bugs me a lot. I like the HM and RF series and this is pretty inferior in comparison. Not bad but not good either."
,Not Recommended,423770,32671225,Posted: 23 June,all,DatGamingGuy,"This game is alright for the 50c that I paid for it, but it's only a half-baked harvest moon ripoff. I've only played 5 hours so far and about 35 days in and here's some things to say about it:1. The first problem is the map of the place, like seriously, how big does it need to be? It took me nearly an hour to learn how the map is laid out and where all the shops are placed, way too long.2. You barely get to farm. At the start there's like 6 places where you can grow plants and you have to upgrade your hoe to be able to farm in the other spots.3. You can't name your own animals or pick up your chickens. This is something that makes me sad, part of the reason why I loved Harvest Moon is that you could name all your animals and you could pick up your chickens, adds to the emotional attachment.4. You can't hatch your own chickens. I really liked being able to hatch my own chickens.5. When you buy chickens you have to wait until they start laying eggs. Like, really?6. You can't move the animals at all which makes things annoying when they're standing in literally the only exit of one part of the enclosure. I once had to sit there for like 5 minutes waiting for the damn chicken to move so I could get its egg.7. Energy usage is weird and you don't get enough of it. So you don't use energy for watering your plants, but you do when you pick up mushrooms? And by the time you've picked up all the mushrooms you've used half of your energy which will only last 3-4 stumps.8. Mushrooms are randomy placed. Just a nitpicky thing, I don't like it9. Nothing to do. By the time you run out of energy it's like 1pm and you can't do anything more so you end up going to sleep at like 3pm every day. I find that a waste, you should be able to restore your energy more than just the one burger you can get at the restaurant10. I don't like how the mines work. There's multiple mines in the map, all of the stones are placed in exactly the same place and once you've mined them you have to wait a couple days before they regenerate. I much prefer how Harvest Moon does mining11. Popups every time you do something. You get the same damn popup every time you pick up a mushroom, drives me nuts12. Only 2 cows. Even when you upgrade your barn you can only have 2 cows and 2 sheep, I want more :(13. Instantly upgrading the cow barn. Like seriously, I bought the upgrade and I walked home and it was upgraded. I'd prefer it if it took a few days at least, makes it more realistic and forces you to play some more.14. There are areas where you think you can walk but there's no actual walking space there.15. You can't die or faint from over working, but if you dare to harvest honeycomb without spraying the bees then you're as good as dead.16. No seasons. This is something that I really missed, having different seasons where you can grow different crops and you collect different items from the ground.17. The heart system is weird. First you have to get them to 5 stars, then you get blue hearts, then green hearts? or is it red hearts? I can't even rememberI've barely even started this game, I'm only 35 days in, upgraded my barn and barely got a girl to like me and you can already see how many complaints I have. I only got this game for 50c though so I don't really care but I don't recommend buying it at full price when you can download Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town for free and it's 100x better."

One of my biggest quirks about it is that you can only save when you sleep. If you have to leave the game and you still want to do more with the day, too bad. You either just quit and redo the time, or you sleep and erase the rest of the day. Overall, it's a good game that is pretty accurately priced."

It's a very minimalistic game, with the time limit being mostly negligible and without there being any seasons in the game. Despite this, it still remains fun. It's nice upgrading your tools and unlocking new crop seeds you can buy. There is a good bit to explore and you progress through the caves as you get better tools.The music is pleasant enough to last you through the game, and while the artwork is weird and ugly, the in-game graphics are simple and pleasant as well. The characters are very immature, childish even, where sometimes they will act like you would expect, but then others they will act like a 7 year old and say something outrageous. It's kind of off-putting when even the girl you end up marrying starts acting like a spoiled brat. You usually run out of stamina much sooner than the day ends, so you'll find yourself going to bed around 12 in the afternoon not too long into the game. The gameplay gets a bit stale and becomes a repeditive task after a while...yet...for some reason the game draws you in and makes you want to see it all the way through. I have almost a full day of playtime put into this game, and if you enjoy games that you shouldn't take too seriously and have a weird unintended sense of humor, you might end up enjoying this one. I did, and recommend it to anyone with an open mind, especially for how cheap you can get it."

After they create their character (which has absolutely no customization whatsoever). they're thrown RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE of the town. The opening cutscene is OK, nothing flashy or fancy or even interesting here. After the cutscene (which lasts all but a minute), you're thrown right into town. One lady greets you ""Oh, welcome, the other owners left in a hurry. Good luck"" And that's it.  She gives you a starter pack consisting of three tools (sickle, hoe, and watering can) and three seeds (Strawberry). There is no map, or atleast one I've found, so the first day is a struggle trying to find everything (the map is huge and consists of several areas of forests and a beach). The first person I talked to said ""I'm bored."" Not ""Welcome to the town!"" or ""How are you doing?"" just ""I'm Bored"". Really? I'm bored of this game already.Some of shops and buildings open at certain times. If an NPC is supposed to be somewhere they don't make their way to the building, THEY ♥♥♥♥ING PHASE OUT OF EXISTENCE. Either a bug, glitch, or intentional but either way, it's awful. Most of the townspeople lack personalities. Seriously, it's like a Generic Town simulator. I found a few cocky NPCs but their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ attitudes made me not want to talk to them ever again.Farming was way too simple. Press the button to hoe, to plant, and to water. There's no switching between tools so I guess that's useful for lazy people.The day seemed to drag on, painfully. Literally, running around the whole damn town talking to everyone and visiting buildings took till 7pm.Pros+Farming is easy (no switching between tools, just pressing the button will automatically use the reccomended tool)+Huge town to explore+Item customizationCons-Dull scenery-NPCs are very generic and lackluster-No map-Doesn't feel like a true farming simMaybe I didn't give this game much of a chance.

To be completly honest I'm very impressed.So far I've only found one bug which is when entering the workshop and being able to walk around in the black area around the workshop but if anything I found it more amusing then annoying.I'd recommened only a few things that would make the game better.Of course a gender option would greatly improve the game because many people don't like playing games if they can't choose the gender and it was one of the reasons I wasn't sure on buying the game.More animal options. For example horses and cats, these are common farm animals and I'd love to be able to have a cat on this game. Despite the fact that horses have no way of income it would still add something to the game and can even be used for parties.I think being able to hire workers would help because most of my time spent playing the game was going back and forth collecting materials and I'm constantly running out of energy quickly which makes it repetitive and slightly annoying. Especially since it takes a lot of resources to upgrade a tool or make something.The workers would also help when it comes to actually running the farm. Of course you've hired them though so you'd need to be paying them.Now I'm not sure if you can have children in the game. If you can then that's awesome. If not then I think its something worth adding because when they're old enough its more people to help take care of the farm, go fishing, mining or collecting logs.These changes are simple and I honestly wouldn't mind sitting through an update for these because they could greatly improve the gameplay. The game is great without these but I think that these would make the game more intresting and less repetitive."

The reviews were quite iffy so i was expecting a not very great game, I have played about 20 different harvest moon games so I have lots to compare to. It is a simpler version but of course it would be because its a cheap game (i got it on sale for $4). My thoughts: If you like Harvest Moon, you will probably like this to."

Its too bad the story bit isn't very detailed. Anyhoo~This game is addictive and do I recommend it? YES

Overall so far it is pretty good, I would add running into the game and the choice of being female. The buttons are a bit annoying sometimes and multiple times now I have accidentally quit the game. The game would also be better if it informed you more about what buttons do what, as I had to figure out that 'X' brings up your menu. Lastly I would like a save function, as the game autosaves everytime you sleep, but if i want to stop playing the game in the middle of a cave I lose all that progress. Which I found out the hard way because the game does not tell you it autosaves when you goes to bed and only when you go to bed (or maybe there is some way to and I just have not found it out?). Over all it is good, but could be improved upon."

This game isn't great, but it's not bad. It's surprisingly glitchy for a final release. There are a few that are game-breakingly bad.If you play with the dog then give up and go find the ball as your character, YOU TURN INTO THE DAMNED DOG. You can't interact with anything, and there's no way to turn back into the player character other than closing the game. Even if you try to load your save you can't interact with the 'save bucket' or whatever it is.Speaking of reloading saves, everytime you relead, your chickens have layed less eggs. Not sure why, as everything else seems to be consistant.Last major glitch, DO NOT walk behind the fences as you are switching map screens. You will get stuck and have to reload.The controls are clunky but not attrocious, I play with my Xbox wired controller and the only problem I found is that it needs to be plugged in before I open the game or it doesn't register.All in all its a decent time waster, I'll give the sequel a go and pray to the farm gods that it's more polished than this one."

I would recommend getting Stardew Valley if you like Harvest moon, but if you want something simple to play this is it.  While I do enjoy farming like Stardew Valley, if I just want to play simply then Our Love will grow is easier to play.  There are problems, First, there appears to be no sound control, which is annoying especially since it has window mode.  The save system is unclear, which is just the last time you slept.  I do like having every tool just assigned to one button.  The story is alright, to the backstory you should read the manual which does have maps and tips in it.  The npcs are not the best, there do appear to be secrets, I found a Genie and she granted a wish.  Is it the best no, but for the price definately worth the play if you like this kind of game."
,Not Recommended,423770,32782326,Posted: 25 June,all,"But it was me, DIO","I'm sorry but the game is bland in both graphics and gameplay. The point of these kind of 'farming & dating sims' is growing to love the characters and feel sucsessful as you upgrade your farm over time.I find the characters, incuding the marriage candidates, unintresting. Rather than feeling like people they just remind me that their NPCs and this is an RPG Maker game.The farm is pre-built (i.e barns and chicken coops) which can be upgraded but only to hold a one or two more animals. This takes out a lot of the feeling of progression.And there are no fields, just pre-set spots to plant on.Something else to mension is that the world is very large but a lot of it seems unnecessary. Bigger does not automatically mean better.World's Dawnis a RPG Maker farming & dating sim that could use polish but is otherwise very good and I would recomend that over this weak attempt."

,Recommended,423770,33725774,Posted: 22 July,all,YPRPG,"Our Love Will Grow is a farming simulator with RPG elements. In a typical day, you will first plant, water, and harvest crops, and tend to your animals, then leave the farm to explore, mine, fish, chop wood, or go to the town to buy and sell various items. You may upgrade your four necessary tools: hammer, hoe, pick, and axe to gain further abilities, but this will require building materials, which are obtained by collecting resources (wood, iron, silver, clay). You have a limited amount of energy to spend each day, which is used for your various activities (mining, chopping, etc.) You can replenish some by buying lunch in town, or finding a magic fruit. Your max energy can be increased by discovering certain secrets. When you run out of energy, you must go to bed and start again tomorrow.Every few days, there will be a party, which means that while you may tend to your crops for the day, once you leave your farm, the party scenario will play out, where you talk to people, sometimes play a game, win a prize, or recieve a new ability. These scenarios are only mildly interesting, but are a refreshing change to the same old gameplay.You may upgrade various structures on your farm, such as your barn, chicken coop, and house. Upgrading your house will allow you to cook and with later upgrades, your future wife can move in.There is a romance component to the game. The five girls can be spoken to or given gifts which increase their friendship with you. When a girl reaches five hearts, she can invite you on a date/outing of some sort. That scenario will play out for the day, in the same fashion as a party. Afterwards her heart count is reset, and you must build it up before getting a second date. It takes a number of dates (I haven't gotten past two with any girl) to reach a point where you can propose marriage. The storyline for the romances is not very developed, so if this is the main draw for you, you might be disappointed.I am far from finishing this game, so I can't say much about the ending, but after 12 hours, I am still not running low on things to do."
