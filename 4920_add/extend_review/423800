I got to try a demo of it at PAX South a month ago, and I thought it was a cool concept, but I wasn't sure how well it would actually work as a strategy game. I can now confirm that it works rather well indeed!It's very different from any RTS I've played before. Instead of issuing orders to individual units, you're trying to shape an every-shifting pattern into something resembling an army. And, seemingly inevitably, the whole thing grows out of your control: you can't be everywhere at once, and if you spend a minute focussing on one side of the map you're likely to find that your monsters on the other side have mindlessly spread out and populated whole areas.The standard ""WAR!"" deathmatch mode is pretty easy once you've learned some basic tactics: just flood the map with your units and you'll probably win. The other modes introduce some interesting twists; I've tried Capture the Flag a few times now, and every time I think I've got it figured out the AI does something unexpected and ruins me. The AI seems quite clever; it's pulled a few sneaky manoeuvres on me.I can't wait for multiplayer! Will this be the first RTS I'm actually good at? (Probably not.)"

Takes a bit of time to get the hang of it, definitely one of those 'easy to learn, hard to master' experiences. Main gripe is the music track, there is only one, repeating track which while quite nice, will destroy your soul after half an hour.Game modes, difficulty settings, customisable number of AI per match, even an autoplay mode where you 'do not' play, but watch AI duke it out. Needs multiplayer, but apparently it is coming.Game seems to be worth the price all in all. Defininitely recommend assuming you like the genre."

I'm sure with the inclusion of multiplayer, the game will soon grow into it's own!- - -Bear with me, you'll enjoy learning about the system behind the game:I'm very familiar with cellular automata, and there are tons of different formulas in which the ""Game of Life"" can be played. Some are made for creating interesting patterns, others can run for hours on end and then fizzle out suddenly, but designing a formula requires balance.Too many ways to reproduce? The entire screen will be choked out by rabidly deviding cells. Too few and the system will fizzle out with nary an interesting pattern.This game's problem is with the former. I can literally put one road out of my tavern and overtake 3 AI's on the hardest difficulty, simply because the AI thinks about how to position it's forces, when all I do is let them breed and overtake the enemy with massive numbers.It's a great game, it's unique, and clever, and frankly I'm impressed with how natural it is in almost a ""factory designer"" sort of way as you build roads to transport your troops, arm them, and then send them off to the enemy, but like I said, no one is going to need to do that.How do we fix this? Well we need to take a look at the formula, and I'm sure in time the developers will change it, but as it stands, the game is broken.For example:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=667120850if you take a look at my other screenshots you'll see what I mean.Great idea though guys, keep it up!"

Hopefully some of the issues I have will be addressed soon, at which point this review may switch to positive.The concept of this game is excellent. They basically took Conway's Game of Life and turned it into a competitive RTS, which is cool... Unfortunately, what jumped out at me right away is that it's lacking any of the metagame to make it really work. When you click ""Play"", you're just given a few options to setup a custom game. There's no campaign. There's no progression. There's no gradual introduction of concepts. You're just thrown right into the deep end, and the only way to learn the mechanics is to read the help documentation on the main menu.Further, the UI is rather poor. To select what to build, you click on a tool bar on the left. But I couldn't find a way to dismiss your current ""tool"", and any click on the toolbar also counts as a click on the ground behind it. If that space happens to be a valid place to build whatever you've got selected, well, you just built it! I ended up with some really badly placed extra taverns early on before I realized I had to be careful about how I clicked on the toolbar.Finally, in my first game, after playing for about 10 minutes and feeling like I was finally starting to get the hang of it, the game just ... stopped. The music was still playing, the monsters were still doing their look bounce-in-place animation, I could still scroll around, select tools and initiate building, and bring up the menu. But the monsters weren't moving anymore. There was nothing to do but quit my game in progress.Overall, this feels like an early access game. It's full of good ideas, but it's painfully under-developed."
76561198071531076,Recommended,423800,30836692,Posted: 30 March,all,iseeall,"An interesting and unique RTS game which is somewhat hard to grasp. You have an army of creatures which move around and multiply in a way somewhat resembling the rules of Conway's ""Life"" game.  You build roads, walls, taverns and other buildings, but all this only controls the army indirectly and in non-obvious ways.The good:- intersting basic idea to use game-of-life like principle, I've never seen this anywhere elseThe so-so:- I found the graphics cute and appropriate for the setting, but I can imagine that many players will find them too simplistic.- sounds are functional but not much more- the map is really big. Completing a single battle takes ages because the enemies spawn new and new taverns and you need to cover the whole map with your soldiers until you finally win. Or at least that's my impression so far.The bad:- the music gets pretty annoying after a while because it's too repetitive. Also, the plain piano track feels very low-budget. I understand it's there to fit the ""automata"" setting but still I could imagine a much better soundtrack- everything in the game takes too long. In fact, you could let the game simpy run, go grab a coffee and come a couple minutes later just to see that not much has changed. The basic feel that ""you give an order and something happens"" is missing here totally. At the same time, a lot of things are happening in the game, all at once, at such fast pace that you'd never be able to fully predict what will happen. This may sound like a contradiction but it's not: you have zillions of small objects moving around but since they can't respond to any commands it all feels like an uncontrollable mechanism which runs mostly on its own according to its arcane rules. You don't have the feeling that you are in control.- there is no tutorial. Instead, there are several lengthy pages with text and illustrations. The only real advice the game gives you before starting is that you need to build ""feedback loops"" but how exactly that could work isn't really clear. Even 1 example with 1 picture and an explanation why that works as a feedback loop would be enough, but there is nothing like that. I tried building just a lot of taverns but it's not clear how exactly the microbes move around them. Sometimes I saw microbes strangely disappear even though they weren't too big.My overall feel of the game is mostly confusion. I wouldn't expect a player of an average intellience to be able to fully understand what's going on here, even if he's patient enough to read thru the instructions. What this game mostly misses is a proper tutorial and maybe a few very small introductory missions which would show how all this exactly works. Despite its interesting core idea, this game seriously lacks accessibility. This is the obvious reason why its multiplayer servers are empty and why it didn't get many reviews (or sales, i guess). I'll still give it more tries and will maybe update my review if I like it more.I'm really split on whether to recommend it or not, but well, since there is no ""don't know"" option here, i'll give it a ""yes""."

I was on the steam store and just happened to buy it the day (or maybe day after) it released and I was extremely pleased. The cellular automata idea is really a cool one.That said, there are a couple things that need mentioning if you're thinking about buying it.1. Knowledge of Conway's Game of Life would benefit you greatly. I've noticed a couple people saying they're confused by the mechanics, but it's just a modified version of Conway's Game of Life, turned into an actual game.2. There are ways to annihilate the computer player easily. If you destroy all your buildings, your cells will propogate into the world quite well. That said, I don't think that's a problem. The idea of the game is to use strategy to defeat the opponent, and that's really fun to do. Letting the game play itself doesn't even benefit you. The value of a victory in this game is that you were able to outplay the opponent, so if you didn't play at all, you gain nothing from a win.Neither of those are bad things, Just maybe something to keep in mind if you're thinking about buying it.Overall I like the game, personally I think it's fine as it is, but I'm excited to see where it goes."

Overall would definitely recommend to anyone that enjoys strategy games and having to think a bit, although there are a few of things that would make the game even better:1.training mode: So that new players can quickly grasp the main concept of the game alot better (abusing feedback loops/disrupting enemy feedback loops effectively)2.map editer type thing: would absolutely love creating unique maps with quircky game play from map design. Such as there being death pits everywhere, or lots of mountain ridges and setting up interesting zombie maps. With maybe the option to set preditermined spawn points + more AI players on these maps3.in game time controls: personally I think the the current speed of the game is fine and all, however having the option to slow down to 1/2 the speed or even pause at times to plan out your next moves would greatly be appreciated, as well having the option to go to 2x when you own 60% of the map and youre pretty much guaranteed to win."

,Recommended,423800,22328583,"Posted: 9 April, 2016",all,ClearCryptic,"Simple and basic once you get your mind wrapped around the logic loops. Most certainly trying to follow the Othello game mindset, ""easy to learn, life time to master"" kind of thinking. Initially, I had some misgivings about the game but as I play I begin to really understand the way the game should be played. At least I think I am.The first thing that you need to know is that taverns don't spawn units. Even after reading how the game worked for some reason I saw taverns as spawning buildings. Although they do facilitate spawning they don't create units. Logic loops are the only form of spawning you can do, which requires at least 5 units. Once you wrap your mind around that, the game makes more sense. The taverns will keep units in close proximity to one another which increases the amount of units you can potentially spawn.Due to the logic loop system used to create new units, some basic math skills is a must. For the love of God.  Find out how to setup a basic logic loop where you're units feed into themselves but have some kind of release valve. If you have too many units in one place they ALL die. Usually a well placed catapult will do as an output.The game form where the AI plays against itself is BRILLIANT! It lets you focus more on how the AI plays which gives you insight on how to play. What happens when you place a building somewhere, when and where they spawn roads/catapults, etc. Very useful when learning the game for certain.I know I've only put one hour into the game, but I know I can easily put enough time into this game to warrant the price. Once mulipayer goes live, this game could easily be worth $10 to $15 depending how vibrant and fun the multiplayer scene gets. The current price is worth the entertainment value you can expect from this game, so long as you have some basic math skills."

76561198079069915,Recommended,423800,22347876,"Posted: 10 April, 2016",all,Ekonant,"Cellular Automata is a fun strategy game about, well, automatons which you will attempt (and miserably fail at first) to control.Unlike in other strategy games you cannot directly control your units, instead you can influence them through buildings such as roads or catapults, meaning winning is as much about ""engineering"" as about fighting. The ressource system in this game is that each building costs units, killing said units if they are nearby or otherwise failing to be built which adds more difficulties to building a massive wall for instance.You can (and will) indeed kill yourself without all the help from anyone.The principle of the game makes for really fun and interesting gameplay which is quite unique.There are 5 game modes, war (annihilate the enemy), capture the flag, king of the hill, fort (defend a fort and protect it from enemies) and my personal favourite migration (you have a huge horde comming at you from the bottom and all players have to scramble to flee them while killing each other)At the moment it does just have singleplayer which despite various gamemodes may for certain people not be worth it.However if you are a strategy fan you should at the very least follow this game and wait for the multiplayer, which should be great fun."

This game seems to be more on the casual side. The enemy AI is not that bright so the game is very easy with little effort to strategizing a winning victory. I found myself just building random catapults (exactly 2 so it's not too many so they continue to multiply) to take the guys out of the initial town and then made them stay put to multiply near the landed spot by building taverns. Then built 2 catapults again to move them elsewhere and a tavern to have them multiply there. Then just rinse and repeat. Not too much strategy to it. Just multiply your guys like crazy as fast as possible which isn't too hard to do. As of now without multiplayer, the enemy AI is way too easy even on the hardest mode. I managed to beat the game on easy, medium and hard all in a row, my first 3 games. If played with other players then might be more of a challenge. I'll change my review if I see it's fun to play with others. I'm not entirely sure if playing with others is fun though since there's really not much strategy to it, but then again, I was never forced to use any strategy fighting against a really dumb enemy AI.Content is very very lacking for a $9 price tag. You can get litterally 100x more content from games that are about $15 ilke Fortress Craft or a more similar game like Plague Evolved, Inc. which has a great multiplayer dynamic with much more interesting gameplay and truly a game difficult to master the strategy to. Or if you want another strategy game that's as simple as this, there's a ton of Casuals out there at $2 or less.I'd say for the amount of content this game has, I would categorize it as Casual and I wouldn't pick it up for more than $1.99 as it stands now."
