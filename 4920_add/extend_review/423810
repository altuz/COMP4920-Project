,Not Recommended,423810,26758187,"Posted: 22 November, 2016",all,Challak,"Shallow, repetitive, and really just not much fun.Play 10 minutes and you've experienced all this game has to offer, and it's unlikely it'll be enough to compel you to return for a rerun.- The sudden shifts between activities feels gimmicky, abruptly ending the action and feeling frustrating rather than the ""sense of random chaos"" the game boasts. There's no fun in splitting up an activity into pieces that are played out in  short sprints.- There's comparisons being made to Mario Party and the like but this game doesn't offer that feeling at all. Imagine playing a Mario Party mini-activity where halfway through an activity it suddenly switched to another activity, made you play 1/3 of that 2nd activity, and then swapped to a new one, only to return to where you left off in the first activity with no sense of progress, accomplishment, or the build up of excitement.- Now imagine that eliminated players could still repeatedly hit you and remove the points you've earned in a game, in a ""juggling-style"" manner where you can't escape their onslaught because they're invincible, making it impossible to win as the skilled player, instead leaving it to the player's (grudging) personal preference in who should win.- Even the activities feel unfinished. This game feels like an early access game, with activities having visual appeal but no polish to the gameplay. Each activity feels rushed to production, guided by attractive art alone, without thought to what makes an activity fun. 12 players at a ""party games"" event and not a single one of them enjoyed these activities. The agreement was they were shiny turds that were equal parts frustrating and boring.- The sounds are annoying. Imagine the high-pitched voices of cartoon characters repeated endlessly in every activity, making the same ""hit"" noises over and over until all you hear is ""oof ah eeee oh umf eh eh oof"" for the entire duration of play. The music might be tolerable (at best) but combined with the SFX it equals nothing more than noise.- It just doesn't cut it as an enjoyable party game, would never work as a ""take that"" competitive game, and just all over reeks of bad design and ineffective (if there was any) user experience playtesting hidden beneath an impressive (and grossly misleading) art budget.Pass on this one. Full out not recommended."
,Recommended,423810,22025268,"Posted: 24 March, 2016",all,Vaelsh,"It's a really fun party game with little minigames similar to some of those you'd find in Mario Party. The point of each one is to get as much treasure as possible. There are 4 characters now (at the start of Early Access) with a variety of colors to choose from. It's still in development but plays great and the visuals are fantastic!Basically how the game plays out is you play a minigame, but partway through it, you switch to another one. If you die in one minigame, you are out of that one but will still keep playing in the other ones. There will sometimes appear a really big treasure idol that's worth a ton so it's worth trying to get your hands on.You can play Local, With Friends (this is how you can play with your buddies), and Online with other random people. The matches can be longer or quick but are usually around 5-10 minutes on average.Overall, a ton of fun and easy to get into! Also the devs are awesome and very quick to respond to questions about the game! I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great family friendly party game for all ages! 10/10"

Only issue is that the online is dead. (It's like 10x worse then mean greens)They gave out a free key if you won at the marooners Pax East 2016 booth, and a few months later if you played an hour you got a key to give to a friend. The game left early acess and had ""Play with Devs Day"" Saturday. Online was still dead after all of that.85/100The Devs are very devoted to the game"

76561198085189433,Recommended,423810,22055552,"Posted: 25 March, 2016",all,Azeal,"Currently quite limited given its early access state but still relatively fun.The game is basically a party game that throws together a bunch of minigames. Instead of playing each game through you have a set amount of game modes that you will randomly jump between (every 20-30 seconds or so). Progress is saved in each game mode so when you jump back to a previous one you will carry on from where you left off.At first this mechanic was confusing and irritating, however I think it has potential to be fun. Either way I would be surprised if in future versions alternate game mdoes aren't available.Some of the issues include poor balancing in one game mode, limited game modes and limited diversity of game modes (all of them are about collecting coins).Usually these isues would not concern me in an early access however the Early Access FAQ says that it will only be in early access for “A few months max.” I expect we will see some balancing changes and maybe, at most twice as much content. The game, unfortunately, needs more work than this to reach its full potential.That being said its still a reasonable game."

If you want to get it you should have a friend get it to play with you. Also it's a little hard to move somtimes and you can get stuck but that really only happened a few times.

It plays best with lots of people, but unfortunately, it appears that there is never anyone playing.  I won a code for a free game at PAX East in 2015, and purchased a second one in order to play with a friend, but it seems that we're the only two people who play.  It could really use a lot more people playing.  It's actually a really fun game!  Reminds me a bit of Mario Party mini games."

,Not Recommended,423810,28911706,Posted: 1 January,all,Bangos,"I watched the videos and thought it would be a fun little Mario Party type game but after buying it and playing it with the family it went stale very fast.  Very few levels/variations and the only bonus right now is if you play for 2 hours (so you can't refund it) you'll get a free steam key to give to a friend.That is the single player part, the multiplayer part is completely unplayable.  The camera is never focused properly and it is very rare to see anyone online.  For a game I wanted to be fun for the family to play, I was absolutely let down and in the end just refunded the game."

I foiund it rather fun and enjoyable, although the minigames were too few and far between. I'm thinking if we got more players online, we'd probably get more minigames. This is definitely one for Markiplier, Bob, Wade, and JackSepticEye to play on their channels. This is the kind of multiplayer game that's right up their alley!If anyone wants to play this, don't forget to notify me. I'd love to play this again."

You don't need to memorize a ton of controls and the mini-games objectives' are easy to understand.  This game is playable by 5-6 years old and up but is enjoyed by all ages.  I find it hard to find games which I can play with my family and have fun doing so, but Marooners fits the bill."
,Recommended,423810,26109380,"Posted: 18 October, 2016",all,DRDeshotel,This game is pretty fun I was kinda reserved about buying it due to price and the fact that I read the games switch before finishing. Turns out that is part of the design and what keeps it from being boring you have to remember where you were when the last game stopped off so when it switches back something bad will not happen. For instance the lily pad level if you forget where your character was while cycling through other mini games you may just walk off the edge. I think the game mode switching is a positive thing for this game. What I would like to see is maybe more variety in mini games and maybe option to select which ones are in a match. Also I'd like to see something different with the capture the relic mini game.
