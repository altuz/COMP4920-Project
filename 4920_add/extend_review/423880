,Recommended,423880,29602548,Posted: 31 January,all,Whiteswart,"Very short freeware visual novel, with a single achievement attached. That achievement is quite fun, by the way. Just like the novel. I liked the amount of different languages I can read through...Generally, I suggest this Carpe Diem piece to all people who don't mind reading some short novels about social relations... And to all achievement hunters, for a quite easy complete game.And I suggest Carpe Diem as a motto to all people who are spending time like me now. Seriously. What am I doing with my life?! Oh, gosh, that's too pathetic.Mark 9/10."

,Recommended,423880,29604996,Posted: 31 January,all,FatBatMan,"The game's only achievement asks the exact same question you will when you finish this...Story is pretty generic, but has a decent twist at the end (though not unexpected).[Played as part of my Visual Novel experience]"

Beware.Pros+ It's free and short so you won't lose anything if you try it out+ Decent art, nothing amazing but okay+ Easy to 100% if that's something that's important to youCons- Lack of variety in art, you'd think that in a short game there would've been time to focus on giving more than what was delivered- Takes arguably tasteless jab at its target demographicFinal Verdict:☆☆☆☆☆★★★★★5/10 - AverageWhat starts out as seemingly cute VN about a couple out on a date ends up using the classic “none of this is real” gimmick on you toward the end when the VN your character is playing crashes and he is left to ponder his life choices. It's understandable that people would be offended by how the game decided to address its target audience by directly shaming you for playing it (even in the only achievement of the game) and it does reek of an attempt to be smarter than it actually is. For this reason I can understand people being angry but I personally wasn't as I like that sort of twist, and the length was so short that you didn't feel like you lost anything by going through it. Admittedly if this had taken up more time to make the same point, then I would have definitely rated it lower.I don't recommend this per se, but Steam has yet to implement an option for you to remain neutral so I decided to give this a thumb up."

,Not Recommended,423880,29716288,Posted: 5 February,all,edemerzel,"I mean.. it's not bad at all for someone's first attempt at creating a visual novel, but it could have been better executed. There's hardly any plot, the twist is not worth it and there is no build-up to it because of how short everything is. The characters are uninteresting - well, I mean, how much development can a character with the short life of five minutes even get - and things that could have been visually conveyed through simple drawings were not, so laziness was a thing at work here as well. How can you be lazy with a game that takes ten minutes to complete? If I made a game that was ten minutes long, I'd want to make it the fullest game I can. This is mostly the reason why I put 'do not recommend'. This is just hardly an experience at all. As I said, dear developer, you can do great things but you just didn't this time."

I was so dumb and such an idiot that I didn't realizethe female's name, AI, was actually A.I. as in Artificial Intelligence. Until it was explained to me by a friend.Although this game has no different endings it definitely had a twist I wasn't expecting.Which I would've if I just put two and two together.In the end, it's definitely worth a try considering it's a free visual novel.7/10"

The girl is your stereotypical anime female (bad cook, loves cute things) which might be nice if you like that kind of thing.  There is a meta-twist at the end which is kind of neat, but getting there is tedious."

It's worth penny and you will not regret getting in.CON: There's not much wrong with this game if you ask me, but one thing that is bad about it is how short it is. I was getting really into it, the story had me hooked till the very end and all i could ask for is a sequel."
