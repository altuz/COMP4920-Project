,Not Recommended,423890,29632017,Posted: 1 February,all,Bwash,"The sims in space but with less to do.at the start of the game you get something that apparently is ""supposes"" to be a tutorial, but saying it's unhelpfull would be an understatement.- how to move the camera? [check]- Instructing the player to build a planet in an unoccupied system? [check]- Instructing said player on how to actually find an unoccupied system? [nope]have fun manually visiting every star looking for a free system.- Instructions on how to actually build a planet? [also nope]- ooh good you found an unoccupied star, now click this button to start building your planet.- Tada, here, have a floating rock with meteors flying towards it.""Hey game, can you tell me what I'm supposed to do with all these meteors?""- Naw, not really feeling it.your created planet will have 3 stats that each govern the production of basic resources, they can range in value from 0 (I dunno, I didn't do so bad) and 100.if a stat is 33 or below you will receive a penalty towards that respective stats resource based on how much below 33.above 33 and you receive a bonus..This would be a perfectly acceptable gameplay mechanic if it wasn't for the non-existent explanation on how you effectively create your planet.I asked chat a few questions, how to find unoccupied stars or how to create a decent planet.The answer to the first question was a link to a website that showed the galaxy map that did nothing to help me find a star that didn't already have squatters.The answer to the second question was ""open steam overlay and look for the new-player-guide or whatever it was called""which mind you, is NOT how you want to educate your new playerbase in how your game works.and to make matters worse, both questions were answered by what I believe was an Admin.(Yeah I'm looking at you Karma, you were chill to talk to in chat but this is not how you handle new players)You can build anywhere on your planet except for the poles, which sounds cool.. but being able to cover every inch of ocean with warehouses and tree farms kinda break the immersion, and there is no penalty to it.You don't influence your civilization into taking the path you want them to take.You have to straight up micromanage every single thing they do.They will strip mine your planet till the last grain of freaking sand.Or drain your oceans untill not a drop remains on your command.But they will just sit on that stockpile for all eternity unless you give them very specific instructions on what to do with all of it.your population is needlessly split into men and women who are apparently incapable of working in the same room as you must appoint workers of a specific gender for each building.if you have 150 vagrant male workers and 7 vagrant female workers and appoint female workers to your refinery those 150 men will not do a thing.When people think of gods they think of beings who manipulate, nudge, and then play the waiting game to get what they want.not guys yelling commands down from the sky through a megaphone.They will not solve their own problems, when you stop playing your population will continou to grow and they will continou to gather resources.but if halfway through the night your population grows to the size where you don't have enough food, they will starve untill enough have died so there will be enough food, after which the population will grow again and everything starts over, and instead of doing something about it they will wait untill you log back in (which could be tomorrow, in 2 months, or never) and they will demand you solve their food shortage.Last I checked I was supposed to be your god, not your errand boyYou know in TV shows there is always that Landlord and people do everything they can to gather the rent because they are afraid the Landlord will break their legs or at least evict them? (maybe I'm remembering that wrong)anyway, You are not that Landlord.You are the passive little maintenance guy who gets called when something clogged to toilet with a big♥♥♥♥♥♥and obediently fix the plumbing"
,Not Recommended,423890,29771802,Posted: 7 February,all,Trekster,This game looks like it could be very fun but it still needs a lot of work with the tutorial and what you can do in the game. As of this moment I do not recommend this game but I would keep an eye on the game.

,Not Recommended,423890,29600505,Posted: 30 January,all,INahGood | Mufark,This game looks like it has quite a lot of potential. The scenery from what I could see were quite nice. However it would not respond to input from any of my wireless keyboards.It does however respond to wired keyboard.When there is a work around for wireless keyboard I will give the thumbs up.
76561198025676319,Not Recommended,423890,29554227,Posted: 28 January,all,Nugglet,"Spent 30 minutes looking for an empty star system.  Once I found one, I created a planet. Moments later I decide to move away slightly to build a second planet with better stats. I accidentelly fly away from my system, only to realize I have no way of returning to my planet. I understand it's early access, but I feel like something like game start is pretty damn important to the game experience. Could not recommend to anybody at the time being, maybe I'll give it another try a few patches later."

Yes, they're very controlling the irony is they beg people come play their games. No wonder this game has such a high negative rating. This game might as well have been created by the Trump administration. If you want a game that gives you more freedoms, look elsewhere. This game is a dead end."

,Recommended,423890,30050570,Posted: 19 February,all,terrathedragon,The game is pretty good as a God simulator type game. Just don't reset because you can't start over again
76561198154934986,Recommended,423890,30089354,Posted: 21 February,all,StRiCtLy_sKiLLz,"Pretty neat game even with what is available as of now.   Interested in see what else gets added and implimented.  As of now I would personally rate it a 6.5/10.    Probably not for everyone but test it out for yourself.   Pre-Alpha 2017,Feb,21st"
76561198028586243,Recommended,423890,30063845,Posted: 20 February,all,gamerking52,"I have seen very few server issues in the last month or so that I have been playing. The game has limited tasks to accomplish but it can keep you busy for a good ten hours or so just learning the best ways to manage your planet and build the best balance for your resources.If you are unhappy with planet stats you can always start over. This doesn't penalty you except just losing a little bit of planet work. In its current state as a game, this is more interesting because PVP is not yet implemented so you can freely restart without fear of reprisal from other players.but based on what the game developer has in mind, combined with what has already been implemented, I feel the game has a lot of potential. Right now it is just a ""farm simulator"" if you will with building to increase production for the sake of building more to increase more production. But once you look at your production lines and realize that the future of this game is to use those to build massive fleets (and protect against massive fleets) then the potential for the game shines.And although production on the game was taken back to rebuild and reform the game by the new developer, there are still clips of fleet battles here on steam. And if Jatt makes the battles look half as intense, I think the game will really be a fun play.The galaxy is huge leading to endless amounts of potential for exploration and planet destruction.You can also zoom out so far that the whole galaxy that the game resides looks like a little blip on your screen...random but strangely satisfying (and perhaps this empty space could be used for something?)"
,Recommended,423890,29421002,Posted: 22 January,all,Hornedfox,I think that this game is very promising. It has a beautiful concept and has been developed beautifully. Thumbs up
76561198332210336,Recommended,423890,29513111,Posted: 26 January,all,Huskey172,"Considering that Gods and Idols is still in it's alpha stage I can't write a full review on it. But what I can say is that the concept sounds awsome on paper, but at this point in the games development cycle there isn't all that much do in the game itself. So I would recommend downloading the game, but wait until it gets farther in it's development cycle."
,Recommended,423890,29527518,Posted: 27 January,all,femrost,It is a great game minor bugs but it's still early access
,Recommended,423890,29498073,Posted: 26 January,all,doom2286,this is a very good micromanagement game it reminds me a bit of civilization and spore space stage with a side of godlyness. game is super alpha and lacking in content but its potental rivals that of minecraft. hope to see the community grow and the devs put out.

,Recommended,423890,30179233,Posted: 25 February,all,Cinco,"2 hours in and I didn't feel like I accomplished whatever I'm supposed to accomplish. 3/5When I first got the game I had to ask in the chat menu how to even create my own planet. After I somewhat figured it out, I spent a lot of time building factories and buildings trying to figure out whatever the objective of the game was. 2 hours in and I didn't feel like I accomplished whatever I'm supposed to accomplish. This game seems like it has potential but it's in a VERY early stage."
