The main idea, using environments to survive in a zombie land, is enjoyable.  The story is acceptable for a zombie entertainment.However, as other reviewers have already pointed out, the game requires improvements in its controls, and this is why I do not recommend this game.  While people says the controls is better than the older version and I have not played one, its control is poor, especially with a keyboard and a mouse.  The hero, Mr. Wayne, can move faster than ordinary humans, though he cannot make smaller steps to stand where you aim to.  This is critical for an action game.  However, if you can think Mr. Wayne's movement traits as a reflection of difficulty of living in a zombie world, this game can be still enjoyable.*1 Its environment is drawn in 3-D, but you can only move to up, right, down, and left."

So i decided to not bother, until i found out that a remaster was coming out, apparently fixing the controls, updating the graphics and new fluid animations.That was a lie. Within the first five minutes i was already in a ♥♥♥♥♥torm of♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game has so many issues which meld together to form an orgy of awfulness. The controls aren't terrible per-se, but it's tenfolded by things such as the unrealistic animations of Batman (Mr. Wayne is his name) and how if he is above or below making a grab his body just teleports or deforms into the correct position as well as the uncomprehendable environment which you cant see for♥♥♥♥♥♥ Since the game is 95% black, inluding Batman, you cant distinguish the foreground from the background to the level ground. Because of this you get stuck in random parts where you dont know if you have to jump up, run jump or ♥♥♥♥ing parkour wall jump to grab a piece of bloody fabric poking out of the darkness like a chode.The dialogue is Wattpad worthy as Batman's cringe worthy performance + the script that a 12 year old autist made makes for some hilarious pointers and cutscenes. If you try to take this game seriously you will be upset as many times the immersion is broken by Batman pointing out the obvious.I swear to god there's this cutscene where the black guy dies (first) and he points out he's dying 6 godamn times whilst coughing as Batman is interrogating him to where his family has been taken ""I have to save my comrades. Where have they taken them?"".The plot of the game or what little of it i could find is that a ladder breaks splitting up Batman from robin, catwoman and black commissioner Gordon forcing Batman to find them at a safe point while grumbling about his missing family while more capable survivors are killing the zombies and dip♥♥♥♥♥ like black cop who drives a ♥♥♥♥ing camper van through a zombie infested city. That is literally it.In all honesty i didnt even get 2 hours through this mess as i didnt want to lose my refund legibility, i've heard that the game gets worse after the Rat maze of ♥♥♥♥ery so i gave up sludging through this mess as soon as the Rat congratulated me and offered me some of his meat."

This “directors cut” version claims to have improved graphics and animation but as far as I can tell nothing has changed, if anything the platforming is even worse, with multiple glitches. The survival mode is a nice addition consisting of one level where you fend off hordes of zombies.Although not much has changed from the original version, calling this a directors cut is an insult and nothing more than a cash grab by the publisher. If you played the original  don’t bother with this."

But as soon as my progress InGame was again disturbed with some of those Bugs and Glitches that are still left in the Game I so far in the end more time with trying to work around all those issues instead of enjoying my time with the Game.The Game is just broken and nobody at the Spanish based Studio or even Deep Silver gave a single damn about it..May it be the InGame Camera that does now and then just move into an position where half of the screen is just a huge black window or where the complete Level isn`t being loaded at all and you spawn right in the middle of somewhere and die when you do a single step or just a hole Chapter not being playable since I am always dropping through the map right from the start when I take a single step Tequila Works proved that they have absolute no scruples of releasing an broken Game and then just move along to their next project without giving a single damn about it at all.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=907833002The Game is even so broken that Tequila Works/Deep Silver had to remove the Steam Trading Cards from theDeadlight: Director's Cutsince those already didn`t worked too many times in the Origin Build of Deadlight (which is still buyable on Steam!) and partly were not fixed till today too!.http://store.steampowered.com/app/211400/This wouldn`t be such an big deal if Tequila Works/Deep Silver had in the end realized that there were no Steam Trading Card in the Director's Cut but as you can see with your own eyes theDeadlight: Director's Cutlaunched with an freaking Trade Forumhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/423950/tradingforum/also the Game doesn`t have those Steam Trading Cards included.This all is just madness since if all those Bugs/Glitches wouldn`t be there in the first place theDeadlight: Director's Cutcould be actually an solid Game..It`s all there. A pretty decent story, a nice and solid Prince of Persia/Limbo Gameplay Style, an Endless Mode,.. it just doesn`t make any sense why you would work so hard on a Game to just left it afterwards in such a broken state and do nothing at all. To make it even worseDeadlighthad already all those issues too so it`s not like nobody at Tequila Works didn`t knew that there are a couple of issues still with the Game while it was still published by Microsoft.Conclusion:TheDeadlight: Director's Cutsadly is as broken as already Deadlight was too when it launched more then five years ago and since then neither Tequila Works nor Deep Silver seem to give a single damn when those two agreed to release theDeadlight: Director's Cutalso it still remained as broken as you wouldn`t even dream in your wildest nightmares.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=908356690It breaks my heart since below all those technical issues a pretty solid Game is hidden beneath all those issues that should deserve much more polishing then it had gotten.I`m deeply sorry but as far as it goes at the current moment I therefore can only leave a bad Rating for theDeadlight: Director's Cutsince I currently have to even force myself to keep playing it after I have played through half of the Game to get through the rest of the Game to just get over it and don`t have to come back to the Game.Thumbs Down.That´s it.

But gameplay and storywise it's not anything to write home about. Same old zombie survival story that's everywhere these days. The game fails to even try anything original in terms of characters and story, so you won't really care much for the protagonist and the other characters, if care at all.Gameplay isn't that good either. They do try some interesting gameplay concepts with how you deal with zombies, but that's about it. The puzzles are quite easy and uninteresting aswell. Also I found myself dying way too many times because of movement glitches, zombies grabing me out of thin air and so on. Also the animations aren't too smooth, they feel very rough and clunky.I wouldn't really suggest this game to anyone unless you're a die hard zombie fan, but even for fans, the lack of originality this game has can make the experience quite boring."
,Not Recommended,423950,23701913,"Posted: 22 June, 2016",all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"Deadlight was originally released in 2012 for the Xbox Live Arcade marketplace, and PC. The post-apocalyptic 2.5D zombie platformer received a wide mixture of criticism over in-game issues that the newly released Director's Cut edition has supposedly set out to fix. So the burning questions in all of our minds looms like a dark cloud overhead; is Deadlight: Director's Cut worth the extra $6.00 over the regular version, is the game improved enough that you should buy it again, and if you don't have either one which should you purchase?The short answer to the above is no, go with the original one. This Director's Cut edition has done nothing to solve the previously identified problems with the game, and in all reality the controls are worse now than before; not to mention the game will freeze up and crash during a specific scene in the third chapter if you die. If you exit while you're in the middle of a scene, you will also return to the very beginning of the chapter rather than whichever checkpoint you managed to make it to; you must go into the Scene Selection screen and pick up as close as you can to where you left off. The newly implemented Survival Arena mode is nothing but an excrutiatingly poor cash grab attempt; it's one very small map, with hordes and hordes of zombies that pour out of nowhere... you're lucky to survive over five minutes with the shoddy controls. It's a very bad and horribly executed idea for a 2.5D title.The story takes place during 1986 in Seattle, the zombie apocalypse has begun and playing as ex-park ranger Randall Wayne you must survive long enough to find the friends you were separated from, along with your wife and child. You were heading to a Safe Point when you got separated from your group, and you continue in that direction in hopes to find your family along the way. It's going to be a long and rough road, with all the ""Shadows"" on the streets waiting to nip at your heels. The plot is further explored through finding secrets, diary entries, and clues that are scattered throughout the maps, as well as cutscenes that are done up in a conceptual graphic novel art style.Visually, the game is stunning and impressive. The upgrade from 720 to 1080p has made a moderate difference in the appearance of the title. You will explore vast areas of the Seattle region, and even get sucked into the underground sewer system which is lain with many deadly traps. You'll also get to traverse areas in both the rain and sunshine, night and day time. The city looks like how you would expect one to look after it has been ravaged by apocalyptic war, violence, and zombies. Overall, the game has a great look and atmosphere to it, along with excellent voice acting and story telling to keep you immersed at all times. However, I did not notice any new animations which is apparently one of the perks to the Director's Cut.The most challenging aspect of Deadlight is its platforming sections, particularly the areas that if you do not move quickly enough you will be crushed. The only reason that these areas are so ferocious, is due to the absolutely abhorrent controls. I'm not sure how the developers managed to make them worse in the Director's Cut, but they have... I do not remember having as many issues with the original game at all. When you climb a wall or fence, and need to traverse to the opposite side of it, you need only push up; however, this results in Randall spasming around like a lunatic as he hops across repeatedly until you find the exact pin-point axis with the thumbstick that makes him stop and actually maneuver properly. Since this issue exists, it creates a chain reaction where if you believe that you are successfully performing the action and proceed to jump, you will cross back over to the wrong side and jump and potentially (most usually) land to your death, or at least a horde of hungry enemies.There are extra additives to the Director's Cut version that include an in-game digital artbook and developer diary videos to go behind the scenes. These small inclusions are again, not enough to warrant the price hike that this version comes with. I doubt that many people will even be interested in these features, but if you are trust me when I say they are not $6.00 extra worth of content.While Deadlight itself is a good game with a great story that will have you compelled to continue to the bitter end, the Director's Cut is nothing but a mediocre cash grab attempt; do not be suckered in like I was. Deep Silver have recently reissued a few of their titles, all the others having come with a hefty price discount for owners of the original versions; this game does not, and even the 15% release discount isn't enough to warrant a purchase. I'm still in shock and awe on how they managed to screw up the control system even more, it really makes some areas nearly unplayable and utterly frustrating. If you watch my included video long enough, you will see more than a few deaths that were the result of controls not working right. The verdict? Deadlight is a good game... if you buy the original one instead. Stay away from this poor excuse of a cash grab.Rating:3.0/5.0- Average, can take it or leave it.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"

Only survival mode and better graphics, which I didn't recognize, is new (I bought it for 3 Euros on sale). Otherwise for the new players, it's a good arcade with great atmosphere and zombies. It's not so hard and I finished the main story with all achievemnts in 3 hours. It's a very nice game but I would not pay the full price for it. Still recommend."

,Not Recommended,423950,29797966,Posted: 9 February,all,Lobobear7,"This is a game with a lot of potential, but falls flat due to careless voice acting, bad controls[my steam controller won't work, using a keyboard is a horrible idea], short length, and a bit pretentious at times. This game would of had more impact for me if it wasn't for the voice acting. The graphics options are a joke, even when I use the config files. This game needed some major anti-aliasing. ""Superior Controls"" and ""this is how survival was meant to look"" are lies. I fealt absolutely no impact with this game. The ""plot twist"" was predictable and kind of made no sense after you think about it. Ammo isn't scarce at all. The melee combat is iffy sometimes. Just play Limbo, Inside, or some other game like that and not this. Full price is a bad idea considering the lack of support after release. If this game had mods, I would turn off the voice overs, implement AA, and make the controls sharper."

Well too high and there's no ""loyalty"" for prior owners, so I can see that being a stopping point for a lot of people.

I still find it a step away from the usual ""zombie survival game"" out there, as you piece together the story you find you're ""not the hero typically found"".Do I recommend it?  IF you've never played or owned the original, then YES.However, if you own the original, then unless on serious sale then NO.

I bought the Director's because I enjoyed the game and having not played it in a couple of years I was happy to do so again. I also wanted to support Deep Silver who were involved with S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Clear Sky which is one of my all time favourite PC games.I know that's not a valid reason for buying a game but ever since the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. trilogy I've kept an eye out for games I might like from THQ, bitComposer & Deep Silver.While I expected this to be the same game what I didn't expect was bug's that weren't in the original version.I can play an hour or so and pass several autosaves (you'll see a saving icon on screen ) but when I then comeback to the game at a later date all the progress I made in the last session is gone and I'm back where I started last time.As well as the save issue I'm unable to start a completely new game. I've tried, I've even deleted the game and reinstalled it, The problem is with the hidden item's. As I progress I'm finding that item's that I should find in game are not there.Another thing is that there seems to be some sort of connection or sharing of data between this and the original game that I own but haven't got installed.I've made a couple of threads looking for help in the discussions section but as expected Deep Silver have no interest in the games condition, After all they're not game dev's they're publisher's, The thread with the saves issue I mentioned has regular posts from people having the same problem,As it stands I can't give this game a positive rating and as it stands my advice is if it's still available buy the original not the Director's cut."

Side scrolling games are what i like and this one has so much to offer if you like that  genre.Pros: - The setting of zombie apocalypse is nothing new but it is presented in new form of side scrolling platform which is huge plus at least for me.- Visual design is excelent and proper to the atmosphere it needs to describe. Everything is grayish and its place, There are no bright or vivid moments after all there are 1% humans left right ? :)- Animation of main protagonist is excelent and very fluid and zmobies look very good also.- Arsenal is not so important and its very huge plus to me that you are not one man army that can kill everything that moves wihtout breaking sweat. If you wait too much you die. End of story.- Story is intersting and ending is decent. Diary is nice which describes Rendals life.Cons:- Controls. Thats the only thing i didnt like here. There are moments where game doesnt react to what you pressed and acts in her own way. It can by annoying sometimes especailly when you have time limit levels like the helicopter level and you die and the truth is that controls are clunky. But after some time you get used to them and its ok, but still remains that they can be better.- Very short game. On average the players that dont want everything to collect can complete it in 3 hours max. For completionist it can last about 6-7 hours for 100%. But for 3 euros i cant complain here thou.- Dont like that they make it almost frustrating to play on Nightmare mode. I just dont know how 1% of all players can complete that wihtout dying.

Most of the people who are talking trash about Director's Cut are mad they didn't recieve the game for free since they already owned Deadlight. I'm just glad I didn't buy it the first time around or I might be mad like them. I bought Director's Cut for $3.99 on sale and it was worth it. I finished the game under 4 hours.

,Recommended,423950,28296225,"Posted: 10 December, 2016",all,B!,"Great game with a great story, and a rather sad ending.I've never really been one for side scroller games, and I think this game has swung me over. It's quite amazing to see how much detail they've put into it. The graphics are quite impressive.I enjoyed all the extra content as well. The artwork, videos, diary, mini games, and the book with all the stuff you found really made the experience complete. I haven't tried the leaderboard game, or replayed the game in hardcore mode, but they are there is that interests you.The campaign is about 6 or so hours long. Can't really complain considering how much I got it for on special. I wish there was more though!My only gripe was the occasional hiccup I had with jumping over walls. Sometimes my dude kept on switching sides all the time, when I wanted to jump off. I used an Xbox controller to play through the game, so I'm not sure if that had anything to do with it. This always happened in time critical situations, so there was quite a lot of French spoken, and many do overs.I don't quite understand all the hate some of the other reviews have, but oh well, to each their own :D I have spent more and gotten way worse.For me though, this game was worth the buy."
,Recommended,423950,33446252,Posted: 10 July,all,Silent Hightimes,If you are a fan of Platformers than you probably would like this game. The art while playing is Great until you get to their cheap ugly cutscenes just plain ugly. Deadlight is just a platformer with another bland zombie story and mediocre gameplay but it's beautiful to look at.

The control is easy but a little bit tricky like everyone else says.Story line is good although I keep asking myself, why he has to be a hypocrite in the end?p.s.: there is an alternative ending in this game, you have to complete the nightmare mode, but it's not worth it, just check out the YouTube for the alt. ending."

,Not Recommended,423950,34369609,Posted: 20 August,all,NecroZombie,"I remember when the first Deadlight came out in 2012, riding on the back of the popularity of Limbo, a game that exhibited a similar style. I still consider Deadlight as a game that triumphed this style by painting a thoughtful story narrated by a brooding and pensive protagonist. However, the Director’s Cut despite its promises falls flat. While it’s still the same game, but the vow taken by Tequila Works to provide updated graphics still remains unfulfilled in this new edition.Whatever improvements have been done to the graphics to make the game more visually stunning is simply hard to notice. Perhaps one of the most crucial things missing from the game is that the game developer has made no efforts to improve the weaker parts of the game. One might pause in the beginning of the game to take a look at their surroundings and admire it for a bit. But, after a while, the mundane and repetitive structures somehow start resembling the terrible bleakness of this world.For a side-scrolling platform that relies heavily on a graphic novelesque narration, the story lacks depth and is predictable at best. In fact, one of the weakest elements of the game has to be Randall Wayne, the protagonist who struggles to express himself throughout the game and character growth is conveniently thrown out of the window by the time you start thinking about taking the game seriously. Finding journal entries of the protagonist in parts of the world where he has never been is downright silly. With all the realism that is part of the game, the inclusion of this strange feature in order to boost character growth does not sit well with me.It took me a solid 4 hours to finish this game, and needless to say, if you are looking for games similar to this one, there are far better ones out there now. The gameplay felt fun in 2012, but not anymore. The control scheme is still pretty indifferent and sometimes you are just dependent on pure luck to survive. It would be unfair to say that the game is completely devoid of tense moments, though. During the very best moments, it will still make you anxious, as you clutch onto your dear life for survival. But, in the end, this does not justify a new Director’s Cut release. A desperate cash-grabbing move of a game that is only meant to be picked up during a sale for the lovers of this genre and the original."

76561198041552449,Recommended,423950,35249510,Posted: 27 September,all,Vareness,"A brief description of the game:Side-scrolling platformmer set in a zombie apocalypse and your dude is vaguely searching for ""his friends"" (I assume the people he randomly voluntarily split up with in the opening cinematic of the game??).It's a very short game and potentially not worth the price; however, I enjoyed it enough that I would recommend it to people who I think would like the art style or who enjoy platformmer games. Fair warning: this game wasclearlydesigned for a controller. I played it on a keyboard, which was a mild nuisance.I played throughDeadlightin about 4 hours (the amount of hours you see as my time played is a lie - I left the game running for awhile!), and that includes reading most of the diary pages (collectible items in the game), playing the 3 mini-games (more collectibles), and hunting down every ""Secret"" in every level for 100% completion (again...more collectibles). I think the game was a bit too short for my liking - they had so much room to work with! why is it so short?! - but it's not a bad game for what it is. I recommend waiting on a sale to pick it up, if you ever decide to pick it up at all.The Good:The game is short and relatively easy to complete with few annoying timed platform eventsThe collectibles are generally easy to find and do add some flavor to the game (especially the diary pages and some of the ""secret"" items)The scenery and level design is AMAZING. I loved the lighting, the model designs, the sound ambiance, the insane details in the background of every shot...If you look at any of the screenshots I posted, you can see just how detailed and gorgeous this game is!Simplistic weapons/fighting. This comes with the game being a side-scroller, but I still like that they kept it simple.Fighting zombies is not a huge part of the game. In fact, I suspect the developers were actively plotting that Inotfight zombies and try to avoid them as much as possible. Rather than fight zombies, I was to avoid them and progress through the levels and storyline. The game is about telling a story. I like that in zombie games. I'm tired of all the zombie-shooters and zombie-survival games that are a dime-a-dozen.The Bad:There were enough bugs or glitchy things in the game that I can't ignore adding it to my ""Bad"" list :( I had zombies occasionally warp through objects or seemingly appear out of nowhere (like they were warping off-screen directly next to me). I also experienced what I can only presume were buggy audio files. When I was going to previous scenes to complete the collectibles achievements, I would get stuck in sound loops for other scenes - not the one I was currently playing. I can't recall hearing that happen when I played through the first time, but it's also possible it had the wrong sound file and I wouldn't have known it on my first playthrough.A few annoying timed platform eventsSome of the collectibles are easy to miss, so it's obnoxious to see you have 90%+ completion playing through the game without assistance, then feeling the need to use a guide to go back to individual scenes to find whatever you missed. Maybe this isn't a problem for most people, but it annoyed me to see I had 98% achievement on my own unassisted playthrough. I understand collectibles are meant to be fun little challenges, but I didn't feel that all the collectibles (or even most) added anything to the game except to annoy me when I saw my completion rating. It just feels like the company was trying to come up with anything that kept you playing their short game an artifically longer amount of time.The mini-games and Survival mode added nothing to the game for me. Again, it feels like the developers were scratching their heads, going, ""This game is a lot shorter than we planned. What can we do to beef up the amount of time they can play the game?"" and decided to add several mini-games. I don't know why these are here. Spend more time making your main game better and less time on the side stuff :((Contains spoilers)The storyline kind of sucked. I saw the ""big reveal"" ending a mile away. It wasn't particularly well done, either. And why would he voluntarily stay behind and let the girl sail off in the boat on her own? That makes NO SENSE. In the story, he saves his allies and chooses to stay behind TWICE - once at the start of the game and again at the end. Why would he do that?!?! He could just as easily save himself. The dude is a parkour survivalist GOD, so I don't buy that he couldn't find a way to get himself out of trouble in either scenario. Makes zero sense."
