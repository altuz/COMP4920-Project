,Recommended,424280,29758678,Posted: 7 February,all,Bacon,"Simple fun game, good to kill time, I guess if you wanted to it would be a pretty easy game to play while jerking it with one hand, simple up, left, right down button movement some enemies you bash others you avoid and then attack. It's got achievements and two levels to choose from and 2 modes. It might not seem much but one mode is fairly easy and then the second mode where 1 hit means your dead sure isn't as easy at first. Best of all its 11mb and its free and not graphical heavy for those who are still running lighter stuff.Things I hope/might be coming anyways - Steam Cards and more levelsFor now I recommend this game, but hopefully adds more features (which I'm fairly sure the dev will)."

WHISPER,"The pig beat-em up, ‘Iron Snout’ has you playing as a piglet that is about that life, on a colorful and brutal fighting adventure for your life.Iron Snout is a free game on steam and if you have a couple of minutes to spare the game is a blast for short bursts.Gameplay - simple, arrow keys only so it leaves your other hand free to do........ other stuff.Creativity - simplistic in nature the game is pretty creativeImmersion - after a few rounds it loses its grandeur if you willReplay - in short bursts only - perhaps after rage quitting from something elseFun factor - definately a laugh and perfect to let go of some ""steam"""

,Recommended,424280,29707170,Posted: 4 February,all,John Hadley,"Very cool little casual fighting game with a fighting pig as the main character.  The feel of it reminds me of One Finger Death Punch.  Enemies run at you from the left and the right and you can use the 4 direction keys to duck, jump and execute standing, ducking or jumping attacks which can damage or disarm enemies allowing you to catch their weapons and use them briefly for melee strikes or to throw at enemies.  You probably won't get a whole lot of play time out of it, but its free and its well done and worth a few moinutes of your time."

Paralellisms will define my behavioural cortexes for the next millenea. And thus endeth the reign of dysgraphia and its love-child with autism. Only can decadence truly be there tomorrow to experience the economic strife of yester-year. *Drop mic.

I know its still in beta, but I can't help to ask why the controls to pick up items aren't in the controls menu. I had to figure it out the hard way. The controls sometimes feel very fast and very sensitive, and if an enemy is near and I'm whinding up for a punch, I find that I swing too early and end up punching too fast. This could be fixed by adding full animations (or you could hold down a key to build up the attack). But, all in all, this game is great! It feels like a mini flash game, and I like it that way! It has great co-op, multiplayer, and single player. 5/5."
