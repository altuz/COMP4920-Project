Granted, that is a pretty big downside, but the rest of the game is awesome.  I've been playing farming simulator for years, and this game fufills what I think is missing from that game.Hopefully, the bouncing vehicles will get fixed soon, otherwise I may not be able to overlook it at a certain point, but for the moment, it only happens when going over 30 km/hr.  So driving slowly, like I would a tractor on a road in real life, and in the field, I see the physics as pretty good.I love how you can upgrade buildings around the farm and the deformable terrain, along with the particle animation.  For the longest time I've been so let down by the dust in the fields in farming simulator, it is a big part of realism for me, and this game nails it perfectly.The bottom line is if you can trust Silden to fix their problems, or overlook the bouncing vehicle thing, this game is a must buy in my opinion.  For $19.99, or for the $17.99 intro promotion pricing, this is well worth the money."

The game brings all that we originally wanted in all the Farming Simulator 20XX games, like tough terrain, insect control, pestiside control, ext. The time system is particularly different with it's by month system, but gives a good sense on when you should work on what. The help system is different and in my view a little better, instead of just getting to hire a hand on the spot, you can hire a ""contractor"" instead, to plow, cultivate, sow, spray, or even harvest and not for outragious prices neither.There are some down sides to any starter indie game, but not bad enough to disgrace it. Like some video glitches from the trees in the distance.  I have played over 4 hours of the game and yet have found a bug that has been stated in these outrageous reviews. It does need to be tuned down in some areas but for the most part there really ain't any problems that I have noticed yet.With that said, if you are a young impatient kid looking for a quick game that you can just rush through, then this isn't your game.  It takes patients and understanding to enjoy a game like this.  If you like farming Sims and have been looking for something different, then I recommend trying this game out.P.S. : If you are complaining about not being able to play a game, because it gives you crashes or video problems.  First check your specs with the games recommended specs to see if it can play it, even if you play games that you think are more demanding.  Not all games are the same, and some are more optimized than others.  Just because it looks lower to you, it might not be.  And to the others saying the graphics look like crap, then I suggest you turn off the blur, it will give a different look at things. (Also if you are having trouble with bouncing then SLOW DOWN! Try doing that in a real tracter and you will find the same issue, even with empty trailers.)"

The physics for driving on the roads are not perfect, so just drive carefully but the rest of the stuff in this game makes up for that. All the crop and fruit planting are far more realistic than FS 15. It will really pay you to do All the tutorials. As for the wingers out there FS 15 has still got bugs example: turn on your lights and game freezes.. I think it's great what these Devs have done with this game and wish them all the luck for the future. We do need another farming sim. If the devs stick with this I think it's the recipe to be an alternative to FS 15. Am not knocking FS 15 as have hundreds of hours in it. Also the price at the moment makes it worth giving it a go."

Some of the auto features don't work everytime yet, like getting the AI to bring in the crop for you.Overall, this game is like a cross between spin-tires and a farming simulator, (because of the soil dynamics), but the vehicles are very buggy just now, (one week in from the release date). In gear 2, your tractor leaps into the air and floats like it is filled with hot air!If you want a fully working game, then wait a while and read more reviews, but don't listen to people who have only played this game for five minutes and given up! Farming is about patience and if your more of a GTA, COD of BF nut than a farming nut like me, this game will put you to sleep!Personally, I cannot wait till someone makes a mod like CoursePlay for this game! I love farming simulators, but I also find it boring going up and down the field over and over again. The next best thing the devs could do, is to let more than one AI work on the field at once, like in the big G's FS13 and FS15. Its a pain in the 'A' waiting for plowing to finish before you can start cultivating, etc.I have played Farming Sims since early 2000 and started with John Deer Farmer et al. Check out Farmer-George on Youtube orTwitter.com/FarmingSimsI will probably make a few videos for this game!"

That version was really a big mess. The developer of that and this game made some fixes to FE16 that solved some heavly problems, also some of them stayed in the game.. That made the game just worthless and no any chances to playing it again.. They also promised to still improve that game.. But because of FE17 i dont think they dont really have the time for it to do that. Because this silden team is not very huge. And i think they have to much to do to improve Fe2017 instead..Do you expect that it would be a big change from FE16 to FE17. I would say no, because its still the same looking game with the same type of graphics. But this FE17 game should actually called FE16. But the view on the commercial side, FE17 sound newer and need to be more actractive to buying the game.If you look on the features side, it is still a sort of improvement.-Loading times are sorter, no heavy gpu load with the game is loading, the in game map is improved, there is now a garage for maintance, the helper is improved, tractors doesnt slide anymore, doors and gate automatically goes open when you standing in front of it. And also the verhicles are improved on the looks in the store, there are more brands now and so on.But there are indeed still some flaws in the game.. Its not the same game as farming simulator (i own from FS 11 to FS15) but feature wise it has much more to offer then farming simulator.Some things works a little shocky, game performance is a little down. But if you only look to the features its a nice addition against farming simulator.I would give this version a 6 / 10 when they would fix every flaw that would still in the game.Is it worth 20 euros? I would say no, because quality wise i still let it a bit down.I would say if you can get it for 10 euro perhaps 15 euros, i would see go for it."

The controls are wonky and often confusing, at first.

Rebooted the PC and was able to launch.Controller support is lacking badly at this stage. Mine (Logitech F310) wouldn't let me configure buttons for various tasks.

Despite the bad reviews i bought it and its amazing.I dont know if the devs fixed most of the bugs but i havent experienced one bug since i started playing. There are so many aspects of this game that other games in this Genre didnt event think of. You start with only a silo for wheat you then have to build and upgrade them. Your tractors need servicing. You loose traction on wet terain. Needles to say i am looking forward to Farm Expert 2018
76561197970703997,Recommended,424590,25401049,"Posted: 7 September, 2016",all,Siofna,"When considering this game, one should also consider it's price tag. What do you expect?Yes, the game has a heap of bugs. Yes the game's physics are a bit weird.Basically, what SILDEN trys to do is to provide a little more realistic spin on farming than the rather arcady market leader while being enjoyable as a game (ploughing at 15 km/h? Not in this game. Although, you could - it is only very hard to control).Machines get dirty and decay - but can be fixed. The ground is dynamic (ploughing feels like ploughing, not like painting a surface with a different texture), it has greenhouses in which you actually have to 'work' to get something and orchards - both with their own set of tools.It has a detailed field 'health' system - herbicides, fungicides, manure, fertilizer, lime (which is missing atm).The farm can be expanded with a set of different buildings, like larger silos, gas pump, etc.The major downside of this game is the multitude of bugs. It is very clear that de dev had to release to beat FS 17 to get at least a tiny market share. But it IS playable. It is fun. It is different.This game, bought at 18 Euros has given me more enjoyment thant a recent space exploration game costing 60,--. If nothing else, it is a nice 'filler' until the other one comes out. Will I keep playing it after that? Most probably not. But still - it is a nice game and certainly not as bad as the reviews might suggest.It has flaws like not explaining much, not too many 'real brands', etc. It's still fun.If you want some footage of the game, check Arthur Chapman's Channel on YT (english). He played through the tutorials so far and that should give you an idea."

I saw devs working on the game so i gave it a positive review and decided to come back to play it when its in finished state. Sadly devs stopped working on the game a couple weeks after that, which they have a history of doing before with previous games. Therefore i feel obliged to change my review. This game is not worth the money in its current state. It is an unfinished product.I'll boycott these developers in the future aswell. They keep releasing half-finished products and never deliver."
,Recommended,424590,25511419,"Posted: 15 September, 2016",all,Col.Skipper [DAIR],"Yes it is a bit bumpy around the edges, but feature wise this is miles ahead of the FS series.If you just look at crops - pest control, fungal control, weed control, as well as the usual fertiliser.The range of products you can grow is staggering compared to FS's 6 (7 if you count trees...).There are more animals, and the breed, workers are much better coordinated, and don't cost STUPID amounts of money. (Not sure I'd pay €100 for an acre of ploughing.. Maybe half that - but not like $1000s in FS)Like I said, it is a bit rough at the moment, but the devs are active on the Steam bug pages, and are responding and fixing the bugs.Should probably be Early Access, but it's a good game!

After finding what after starting to play at evening I stop playing only at dawn I started to plan my time for fun more carefully :)Looking at other reviews I see game will not leave you impartial. You will either love it much or hate it much. Give it a try. With a title price usually worth 20 hours of gameplay you'll either don't like it and will not lose much or you'll find experience you will like very much. But please note, I think 12 hours a week is bare minimum to have some fun from game.Game is simplier and brings less variety in many aspects than market's leader. But sandbox experience is no less enjoyable when you invest enough time into building it. I even think it is not correct to compare this game with any other, because I tink it brings its own style."

With that said the vision here is great and for a game I spent 17 bucks on its pretty amazing.  I know that the dev will work out the issues and refine it..  I would like better wheel support for sure.  If you download this game expecting Farming Simulator just stop now because this game is completely different.  If you liked FS with MR mod you will like this game.. granted its not nearly as refined but I am looking forward to the devs refining it and this will be a good game.I can not give this game a thumbs down .. its not perfect but no game is perfect.. could it be better refined .. yes for sure but its not a bad game at all.

Consider the game a mixture of Spintires and FS15. It also has some repairing vehicle features similar to Farm Mechanic Simulator 15.This game needs patience. If you don't posses such atribute then you better avoid the game or any other farming game for that reason.The machines are runing smoothly and keyboard driving feels right.

Therefore I do not write often reviews, only when I feel that the game needs to pick up reputation. And this is the case. All those negative reviews are based on the fact that the game is still in development. On the contrary, I see a very promising game with developers actively communicating on the forum. Example: Dear developers, I ask you to fine-tune the braking system, as currently it is not very realistic. On the second day followed an update in which braking characteristics have been improved. Then I gave another suggestion that in any administrative farm should be a dog. Answer: Dog is a neat idea as well, we'll think about it!Who does not like unfinished games, dont buy this game, but be sure to check here later and reconsider the purchase."

But I chose to take the risk and purchase the game with the knowledge I could refund it. After I started the tutorials my view on the game changed. It was on par if not better then Farming Simulator and I am so glad I bought it. I feel as though this is a complete different game were as the farming simulator as just copies of the last one with new maps and vehicles. Though it has a few rough edges right now with tractors and machinery bouncing around a bit to much on contact with terrain and a couple other items it is a great and well worth game that I would recommend to my friends.For $20 this game is a good purchase for all those who want an indepth farming experiences that requires you to really do the work. For me I have worked on a farm with pieces of equipment like this so for the tractors to have gear ranges and the ability to change the wheels, ad the jack on the front, and have to worry about your machines break from use adds such a nice reality to the game. Also the terrain control is awesome, though it needs a little work yet it is still amazing to have to worry about your machines getting stuck in the mud, or bouncing along when you plow a field.Another plus for me is that you can upgrade your farms buildings, the silos only store so much so you have to upgrade them ot store more or sell as you harvest, its not just infinte size were you just wait to sell when the sales goes on like in giants. This game has such a wide variety of items to do and I have yet to get to the orchard and animals in my adventures of the game. The choice of animals is much better in my mind when it comes to what you can raise and how you can raise them.All in all I would gives this game a 10/10 with a vast room for expansion of items to buy and things do and choices to make in the world of farming."

The realism side of things as i said is a step in the right direction and i brought this due to farming sim 17 just looks like it should be a DLC not a game they have added hardly any new content at all in its near enough the same as farming sim 15.

,Recommended,424590,26189039,"Posted: 23 October, 2016",all,Whitehaul,"I absolutely love this game....and Ive been playing ""the other farming"" sim since 2009. To me this is in another league, it is more a simulation than a game, your actions dictate your crop yield, if you skip a stage your yield is reduced, I actually feel like I am working the fields, my tractor struggling for grip and slipping the ruts etc thanks to the clever deformable terrain. The game is full of nice little effects, Increased black exhaust  smoke when tractor under load, little birds that fly off just before u run over them, Aerial spraying, realastic dirt modelling and a clever calendar advance system with a stunning 24hr environment cycle, watch the sun set and the moon rise and wake to the sound of the church bells...seems real enough to me.The developers have tried hard do do somthing special with this and for me at least it works, sure there are a few problems but those who know, Fs was full of bugs when it came out often relying on clever 3rd party modders to sort them out. Whats more the developers are very active in the forums which is good.This game deserves to succeed so ignore all the negative feedback from those that have played it for only an hour or are trying to run it on under spec machines its not expensive when you think of all the effort put in to get it this far, so if your on the fence..give it a go. Hopefully the farming simulator community will see its potential and 3rd party modders will come on board and we will get the farming simulation to beat all.I was waiting for FS2017 to come out, but after playing this for about 50hrs I know it wont feel as real as this does so with this I will stay...keep at it devs..!"
,Not Recommended,424590,25474594,"Posted: 11 September, 2016",all,MacPlatters,"TL;DR - Game is far too buggy to recommend, unless you really want a hardcore difficultly version of FS.The feature list of FE2017 looks great. Unlike Giants Farm Simulator, this game strives to be more realistic. There is an actual calendar that determines when you can grow crops, the game differentiates from fertilizer, herbicides, and fungicides, many of the tractors have actual gearboxes instead of CVTs like FS, and of course there's the deformable terrain.On top of that, the game doesn't start you like FS with every single piece of equipment needed to do every task. Contractors will have to be hired at the start to do certain activities before you can afford the equipment to tackle it yourself. While the game does have sheep, cows, and chickens, it also has features not in FS like orchids and greenhouses (that you interact heavily with that is). There's even the ability to damage and repair tractors and modify them with front loaders and dual-wheels. When the features are all listed out in a bulletpoint fashion, it's easy to see why many were hoping for a farm sim game that actually knew what the word sim means. Unfortunately, the lack of polish in most everything makes all that amazing possibility lackluster.With the game being developed by those who don't speak English, much of the text in-game is a copy-and-paste job from the previous version of the game. This is a big oversight, as the game is rather complex and the only source of helpful information is via the in-game help, which speaks of features (like winter crops) that aren't actually in the game. This makes the help as reliable as a random forum posters comments. These bad translations really bring down the overall experience with the game. It took me far longer than it should of to figure out how to sell a vehicle as, when I went into a seller's GUI, I assumed ""Sale"" was actually where you'd get a better price on a particular equipment. Also, the place you sell grain? Why that's on the map under ""purchase grains"". Yea, it's something you can figure out and get around, but it's this lack of polish on something so simple. Also, forget trying to compare equipment in the store pages. Unlike FS, it's hit-or-miss if a certain type of equipment has stats you can compare between. I would think knowing the working widths may or may not be shown depending on the type of equipment you're trying to compare and.. as far as I can tell, little to nothing is translated here.If you've seen any reviews or watched any gameplay videos, you'd know how bad the tractors bounce in this game. The game seems to make the ground bumpy by default everywhere but doesn't do anything to smooth out the ground around say... bricked or paved pathways. The result is a tractor that's far more difficult to control on the highway that it should be.That's not to say the game is bad at its very core. I'm certainly not saying that. The land deformation tech is fun to play with and I feel like FS is far less impressive now that I've played a farming game with it. Having to work a tractors gearbox to get the right speed to plow/cultivate adds a certain layer of interaction not found in FS's ""hold w""-only take to driving a tractor. Having to sell cows once they get of age so they don't die on you shows how simple FS take on husbandry is. All the little things that separate this game from FS just shows how little depth there is to FS. If you want more complexity to your farming simulations out of the box and are willing to live with some bugs (that may or may not be fixed, lets be real here), the game is certainly cheap enough to scratch that itch. I myself though wouldn't recommend it to anyone, personally."

A tractor's suspension absorbs impacts and softens the ride rather than bouncing around like its on cobbles - I feel the reslience of the ground and suspensions are not taken correctly into account - also I thought that most tractors today and four wheel suspension, not fixed rear and floating front axle.Given that, the ability to plough a field guiding the tractor with the wheels in the furrow left by the last pass is fantastic and low speed driving is much better than in any other similar game except spintires.Driving on roads is appalling at anything above mid-speed range especially with a trailer, the physics of hauled trailers is poor - they hunt and overspeed too readily.The farming and farm management is better than any other farming game and FS15 only comes close with several additional mods loaded.  Seasons is a thing in this game and it is essential for farming realism - it takes time to grow a crop and you do need to manage insects and weeds and you cannot just leave it in a field as a money reserve, you must harvest it before it rots and the weather does affect this (actually getting your tractor bogged down in the field is possible in wet conditions).I have had the situation where I have left a harvester parked on the edge of a field, saved the game and come back to it to find the machine partly buried in the ground jumping about as it tried to rectify itself - resetting back to home cured this but in other occasions I have found the rear suspension permanently compressed and the rear wheels partly embedded in the bodywork.So in summary I would recommend this game if you want to manage a farm but not if you want to just drive farming equipment.  It is not perfect by a long way and there may be some more serious issues to come but if you can live with them the running a farm aspects go a long way to offsetting these issues."

Many features and text are missing, for instance trying to sell your crops at the silos bring up empty text boxes and the game does not tell you how much you are selling for. You also would in theory have to drive to the different silos to just see what the prices were, if it even told you. 2 hours of gameplay was on the tutorial, the rest of the 4 is on growing a crop, selling it, and experiencing these things. Furthermore, textures and lighting is poorly done, and flickering can be seen commonly; to skip say, 100 days for your crops to mature, you have to go to the calendar, go to the last day of the month, then skip a day, then repeat for the next 2 months. There is also missing text at the place where you store your grain, you don't own a combine from the start (you are forced to take a loan or hire help), meaning before you even start the game you're at a disadvantage, and the wear and tear of your vehicle doesn't really mean that much. For instance, I ran my vehicles for an entire planting, fertilizing, and harvesting season, and ran into many things due to clunky controls, but I barely damaged the tractor.The game should be advertised as a early access as the game is not yet finished. You cannot tell this within the two hour time frame that the refund term gives.Original review:Just finished the tutorial scenarios and have a decent idea about the game.Positives: The game plays pretty decently. I have it on the max settings and it doesn't go under 60 fps. Furthermore, the asthetic of the game is just that, an asthetic. They weren't trying to make it look realistic or anything. The controls are fine, and from what all you can do (buy and upgrade buildings, plant and havest other kinds of fruits like berries other tree fruits, ensure that your machines are taken care of, etc etc.)Neutrals: The soil physics are iffy. They look alright, and they are a fun feature that isn't present in other games, but they kind of get in the way sometimes. Should the wheel of the plow make a 4 foot deep hole? probably not. But it isn't the end of the world.Negatives: Minor bugs. Some of the textures are popping through others (can see small patches of grass through fields, streets etc. Nothing to write home about (but enough to write in here!)) Also it seems like some of the machines were rushed. The last tutorial was of the beets, and the beet harvestor looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥ The treads on the front of it doesn't look finished at all. The bumpy roads. Bad? Sure, but again, its not a game breaking bug. And finally, apparently you cannot switch between tutorials without fully exiting the game, or at least I couldnt figure out how. Again, this is easily overlooked, as its only 2 hours of the game.But in the end, there isn't anything better or worse than FS15, and I believe it will be better than FS17, as it seems like they've just added a few new toppings on an already aging game engine. The devs will need to patch some stuff, and there is mod support. For $15 less that what FS17 will be, its a worthy contender even with its flaws. As I play the game more, if I find issues that cant be ignored, I'll update my review. The game's tutorials took me 2.1 hours to finish, so I could refund it if I wanted, but I probably wont. I believe after a few updates, it'll be a fantastic game."
