Some of those cubes contain explosive material (the 'mines') which you need to identify and pick off.  The same principles as Minesweeper apply: the number on the cube indicates how many mines are in adjacent cubes (and the contact can be cube faces, their edges or even just corner to corner), so if you unveil a cube with ZERO on it, every other cube that makes ANY kind of physical contact with that cube is safe to unveil.  The unique style of THIS game (besides its 3D) is that when you've identified where an explosive cube is located, you can remove it, after which all surrounding 'clue' cube numbers drop by one to reflect its removal, further helping you to solve the remainder of the puzzle.It's both fun AND tricky at the same time.  Getting used to Minesweeper in a 3D space takes some adjustment, and I found the mouse controls a little clunky at first when trying to navigate around my mass of cubes.  This is a game that seems to have been designed for tablet8/phone first which might explain this to a degree, but once familiar with the various clicks and how to switch viewing angles easily) it became a joy to play.Quite honestly, this is the best £0.71 fun I've had in ages.  Yep, that's right: an enjoyable game that costs less than most postage stamps, is the third of the price of a Starbucks coffee or McD burger.  Honestly, the devs should really consider a Hexcells indie price because it is worth that."

It's a game that allows for a lot of customization of difficulty (after you beat the story mode.) I'd say as a whole the story would take 3-5 hours depending on how well you catch on to the puzzles.StoryThe story surprised me by actually being interesting for a minesweeper game, which was a nice addition to an already cheap game.AchievementsYou'll perfect the game a few custom games after beating the story, so in whole it'll take roughly 5 hours to perfect the game.ReplayabilityAs I said the custom levels allow for a lot of replayability in the sense that you get to pick how many blocks, what shape and the dispersement of the mines for the level. You also get to pick which (if any) aids you want to have during the level. This means that you can play this game for as long as 3D minesweeping is appealing to you."
,Recommended,425070,24374088,"Posted: 17 July, 2016",all,ChoNammoth,"Loving the idea of this 3D minesweeper, truly! Two points to be mentioned though:1. It seems that I cannot use the ""R/T+right click"" to eliminate the ""0"" cubes even in a row smoothly. They are always erased too much like deep to another layer or just stuck in halfway, maybe still several left to be clicked again. It would be nice to have a check mark function with shortcut keys or a dragging function for an easier elimination of all the tagged cubes simultaneously (different from""C+right click"" for the adjacent cubes detected for no mines).2. Who else is confused as me about this stochastic/random machanics for the begining of each game from the section B? Sometimes I get not even a digital clue in a discrete model, and sometimes up to 5 figures (usually ""1""or""2"") but all seperately on the surface of a cuboid. Not always do I know where to start with +_+       or maybe I'm just too stupid...ps,sorry for the bad English, hoping I have expressed the meaning quite well."
,Not Recommended,425070,32213626,Posted: 5 June,all,Phlosioneer,"Camera and controls are sufficient to play the game. However, the game makes no attempt to prevent situations where you have to make a random guess. The same was true in the original, but the levels in this game take a lot longer, so there is no instant-retry like original minesweeper. That, combined with some levels having 5-8 random guesses to complete, is unacceptable."

,Recommended,425070,30596104,Posted: 18 March,all,BlazingSniperHeels,"I personally love minesweeper and I am almost always ready to try out variations in minesweeper. I would say that this version is by far, THE BEST! I could play the conventional minesweeper without having to think at all but this one needs more attention. I would definitely recommend this game.It takes a while to get a hang of it- especially toggling between reveal and sweep mode, and the camera. But since there is an option to place the camera on any tile, I change the position on the camera often. (However, that might be the difficulty since I do not have a touch screen.)I was not sure if I would enjoy it when I bought the game but now I am glad I did."

Especially the music was nice and ""chilling"". So the game itself gets a positive rating. What I rate it negative for is the forced online mode. You can only play as long as Steam is in only mode. I have seen this nowhere mentioned. I prefer to play with Steam in offline mode. And I also don't see a reason why this must be online. Thus a thumbs down for bad communication and a ""useless"" feature."

Price set at 0,99 €/$/whatever places this game in the same price tier with shameless Plants vs. Zombies rip-off and some other terrible games I won't mention here. This makes it easy to overlook this little gem. It's exactly what description says - minesweeper in 3D with few twists here and there. So if you're minesweeper fan, most likely you'll enjoy this game."

I do have a couple of complaints. You cannot mark bombs which is annoying, although this increases the difficulty its still very irritating above all. I beat the first level, but the game did not realize i beat it. So i am basically stuck on the first level even though i beat it. Fix this and easy profit."

,Recommended,425070,25486214,"Posted: 12 September, 2016",all,Strelec,"Minesweeper in 3D.Achievements are simple and straightforward, save for the final ending achievement. 100% in less than 5 hours.The game plays like minesweeper, but in 3D, and adds a few more mechanics as you progress. Things such as flags of how many mines exist in a column, or color-matching frames to indicate the same type of block (mine or no mine) add some flavor. Best of all, there is complete replayability in the game, since you can customize random levels that utilize certain aspects.My favorite option to use in a random game is the shifting of cubes: it effectively shuffles unrevealed cubes around by one block every few turns. However, this appears to NOT work in conjunction with the color-matching frames option, so BEWARE!"

,Recommended,425070,26364500,"Posted: 1 November, 2016",all,Bob Spigot,"Remarkably easy to control and fairly nicely polished 3D minesweeper.It involves a few different mechanics that can help you out, and can generate all manner of different level styles. There is even a short sinister story line to follow.Some issues though,There are no independant sliders for sound effects and music which is a shame because I found the sound effects grating while the music is excellent. (You can get around this by playing the music direct from the installation directory and muting the in-game sounds.)It appears to lack a windowed mode. Which seems to be a constant and infuritating issue with a lot of small games, over two decades of window mode games, there is simply no excuse for ever leaving it out.There is also an odd but fairly rarely encountered glitch when you reach the apex of the rotation up or down where it ends up flipping you. Not sure if this is some gimbal lock issue, or some such, but it can confuse things.Ultimately these are fairly small problems with an otherwise addictive and good quality game."

Plus, it's cheap. The mix of a 3D element and new mechanics made the game definitely worth buying. The messages, though. XDOh, and I'm glad that they made an update that allows you to reset the game when it had the template levels and got you still ""earning money"", because I had to delete it in order to grab the Ethics Fail achievement. Props to them.If you have some time and money to kill, give this game a go. The music can bore you, but it's that calming pace that makes the game enjoyable."
