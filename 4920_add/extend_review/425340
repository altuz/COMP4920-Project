,Recommended,425340,20705555,"Posted: 23 January, 2016",all,Ravenwild,"The game is pretty good, at this price it's definitely giving a try if you like scrolling shooters.It is a huge ripoff of Cave games, it's up to you to decide if that's a bad or a good thing, but you'll be able to tell right away that you've fought every single one of these enemies before. Except for the bosses, those are original as far as I can tell. Coincidentally the bosses aren't all that great.For difficulty, I only played a few credits so far and haven't beaten it, but I'm under the impression veteran players would consider it too easy. Can't say I've had that problem before.Scoring is pretty simple, you shoot stuff with the shot, when they turn black you finish them off with the laser, they call this soul drain and it gives you a set bonus per enemy. There's an audio cue when the enemy turns black and they will still have a good chunk of health left at this point, so it's not necessary to memorize how long it takes to kill each enemy like you would on ESP Ra.De. or Ketsui, it's a lot more lenient. There's also a 2x bonus for killing bosses on the last 2 seconds of the timer, point pickups hidden around the stages, and bullet grazing. Save for bullet grazing which is more fluid, all of these are very discrete mechanics, you either get the bonuses or you don't, and it's not all that hard to soul drain every enemy in the stage. I imagine it's very possible that a good player could with enough practice come very close to the theoretical max score of the game, which is weird.Anyway, it probably won't keep you interested for years but it's a good game. I've never heard of 1CC Games but I hope they make some more."

Has a lovely, hypnotic, trancey, laid back feel to it.Has a really good scoring mechanic where you ""soul drain"" larger enemies by hitting them with your wide/rapid shot until they turn black, and then finish them off with your laser to score higher.soul drained enemies become more aggressive, firing out more bullets, so it's a lovely risk/reward system.A lot of bullets home in on you in this game so you can't just be flying all over the screen, you have to stand still when you need to.Nice bright, chunky, primary coloured graphics take you back to playschool.Some great, tricky bosses, especially that final one.Really good game, though some of the bosses can't be good for my blood pressure. I'd like to meet the guy who thought up the final boss and shake him by the neck. Finally beat it today though :D"

Fairly unique looking, to be honest.It is fairly fun, and the altering the large enemies, making them more aggressive, but also providing more points. That is fairly neat.If you have a phobia of butterflies or moths, like my sister does, stay the hell away from this, haha."

And if it isn't enough, the music makes the game even worse. It's boring and it doesn't fit into the atmosphere of a bullethell-shooter (if it is supposed to be one). I've also tried DX-Mode. I didn't see you effort put into the hard difficulty, it's just Normal-Mode with after-death-bullets coming out of enemies.And i have to tell you, that this is my first bad review i've ever given on steam. I am always fair and give even better reviews than the game deserves. And i'm also a big fan of Shoot' em' ups. Sorry, but this game has no effort included, and the prize for such a game is too high. It seems like i've wasted 8€ here. At least I should have waited for another Steam-Sale..."

76561198047290897,Recommended,425340,33364793,Posted: 7 July,all,Shar Wolf,"A surprisingly deep game given it's low price.Not overly tough given the genre, but a genre that glorifies in being hard to beat. Possibly easier than most, given the numerous complaints of it being boring, but I found it about average (Again, given the genre.)A surprising fact, insects and other similar creatures make my skin crawl, unless presented in such a manor that they little resemble their parent creasture (such as Caterpie from Pokemon) and I almost didn't buy this because of that.Hasn't bothered me yet.Edit:Also, you can rotate the screen (which does not change the controls) so that you can play it sideways or UPSIDEDOWN! WARNING! The controls do not adjust! If you chose to play at 180 degrees, 'up' will move you toward the bottom of the screen, and 'left/right' are inverted! In other words the controls are relative to the direction the moth is facing. This can make the game MUCH harder, but also more fun."
