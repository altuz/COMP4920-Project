The Room 2 builds upon that foundation with slightly less frustrating puzzle design (no painstakingly tiny hidden switches, better hint system) and better graphics as well as atmosphere.The Room is a game series as unique as it is awesome and beautiful. A true masterpiece and due to the suberb art design, it deserves to become a timeless classic for years to come."
,Recommended,425580,24107593,"Posted: 5 July, 2016",all,LimEJET,"Another fantastic remaster of a great gameLike its predecessor, The Room Two is an immersive first-person puzzler of the Myst-like variety where you follow a trail of clues and tamper with eldritch mechanisms. Failure to solve a puzzle doesn't mean you don't get it, it just means you've not looked everywhere for clues.The game is about the same length and difficulty as The Room 1, but the environments are bigger and more detailed, which is a nice touch.Where the first game has you focus on a central setpiece, moving around it to examine every detail, this game incorporates several such setpieces in each level and allows you to move freely between them (Perfect for roomscale VR, eh devs?). That doesn't mean you can solve them in any order, however, as they are usually interconnected with eachother.This leads to a minor issue where sometimes you're not sure what has changed since you're looking another way, but this only happens once or twice and is mostly avoided by the camera moving automatically to focus on what changed.While I think the controls probably feel better with a touch device, using a mouse works perfectly well.All in all, a brilliant title made gorgeous on PC.And it has nothing to do with the movie, stop asking."

If you played the first game, all you may want to know is that 'The Room 2' is more of the same. Yay! The only differences are: environments are more varied and there is a little more story (but only a little).'The Room' and 'The Room 2' are the best puzzle games I have ever played and I've been playing them since the 1990s. It's puzzling in its most basic form. There is almost no story being told. Chapter after chapter, you just tackle one big puzzle. In order to solve each puzzle, a number of tasks need to be performed, ranging from solving mini-puzzles to spotting hidden compartments in the puzzle and coming up with a logical way to open them. Solving the puzzles feels exciting and rewarding, and it's just a lot of fun. I think a large part of the reason is that in 'The Room' and 'The Room 2', the puzzles feel very 'physical', as opposed to just seeing a board of some form in front of you like in most other puzzle games. It almost feels like you could reach out and touch the puzzles and solve them that way.To conclude, a few short additional notes that may help you decide whether to buy 'The Room' and 'The Room 2' if you're still not sure:- both games are short: about 3 to 4 hours each, so you may want to buy them when they're on sale, although I think the quality of both games certainly justifies their full price.- they're not very difficult: for me the games were just challenging enough but if you're the sadistic kind of puzzler who only likes being challenged to the point of migraine, you will not find that here. On the contrary, there is a hint system in the game so if you feel stumped at any time, you can click a button to give you some pointers.- the Steam Achievements are the most basic: one achievement for completing each chapter of the games.I would recommend this game to everyone, not just to people who like playing puzzle games. It's really that good."

If you're unfamiliar with the series, The Room firstly came out on mobile platforms, and was then fully remastered for PC. The original Room was released back in 2014 and The Room 2 released in 2016. The game's quite simplistic in it's concept. You have a safe, a box, or just a lock, and the player is supposed to open it. To do so you're gonna have to solve all of the sub-puzzles before cracking the big one.While I do get frustrated a lot of times in puzzle games, I feel the difficulty for The Room games isn't too hard but also not too easy, it's perfectly balanced and is able to be satisfactory throughout the entirety of the game. It lasts about 3.5 hours total if you don't rush through it, just like the first one. While some people may not like the short length, I think a short game fits the genre better than a longer one. There are 6 chapters in this sequel, one of them lasts a minute and another one is a tutorial, so in the end we have 4 chapters with challenging rooms to crack.I was quite surprised by the creepy atmosphere in The Room Two, it certainly felt darker than the first game while the main objective is pretty much the same between the two. However, there's a slight difference in this installment, instead of being focused on just one safe or table, now there are multiple places in the room to explore, so moving around with the mouse is possible now.The port is really well made but I did have some slight annoyances. Sometimes I wanted to move a drawer and the game decided to move the camera instead. Also, it should be possible to type on the typewriter with the keyboard. It's nothing game breaking or too frustrating, just little details I'd like to point out.The Room Three is already out on mobile, but I do hope it is ported to the PC just like the first two games have been. This is two of my favorite mystery/puzzle games of all time and having to pick between which one is the best is a tough call, they stand on equal ground in terms of quality, challenge and entertainment, two phenomenal games I'd recommend anyone to check them out, even if you're not into point & click / puzzle games. 9/10"
76561198067002281,Recommended,425580,33756455,Posted: 23 July,all,Myantro,"In my opinion ""The Room"" series is the best of the simplistic puzzle games or ones that you can play with one hand. This is of course excluding games with full controls like Portal, Myst, or The Witness.The ambient noise as well as the sound each switch, cog, & lever make set the mood perfectly. The torches, lamps, & candles all light each room as I would expect them to in real life. Plus this time the puzzles encompass the whole room & not just one puzzle box like it's predecessor making you think just that little bit more. Story is a little naff but I came here to solve puzzles primarily so this is forgivable. Replay-ability is also at a zero as you will already know all the answers to the puzzles. Apart from these factors I would still pay full asking price just on the intricacy of the puzzles & level design.The Room & The Room Two give me hope that games CAN be ported properly. They're fun to play on your own or with your girlfriend and/or kids. They make you think for once instead of shoot and/or kill aimlessly & I will most definitely be purchasing their third game whenever they decide to port it across to PC."

,Recommended,425580,27561479,"Posted: 25 November, 2016",all,Frozen Ray,"This is a good game. Want to see any pros? Read any other review. I'll list cons just to help you make the decision:* There are no high-quality puzzles that you actually have to solve with pen and paper. Nothing is more complicated than ""monkey see, monkey do"", and in the majority of the cases it's even simplier than that. If you want a real challenge, this is not the right game.* A lot of things you have to do are too random and make no sense whatsoever. This is a big downgrade from The Room 1, where most interactions were a lot more ""explainable"" (""because this is a big puzzle box with hidden compartments"", etc.)* Your greatest enemy is your monitor's brightness setting. Thankfully, you can adjust the brightness of the game in the options menu.* Sometimes game uses creepy flashes for the atmosphere. Not quite as bad as real jumpscares, but if you are sensitive to such things (or you are playing with an easy-to-scare kid), beware, and play in a well-lit room. In my opinion, this was completely unnecessary for a puzzle game without a real horror element.* Some parts are just tedious and annoying. There are quite a few ""puzzles"" that will make you repeat the solution several times, probably just to make the game a little bit longer.* Despite everything, the game is super short. I guess it can take longer than 2 hours if you just got stuck and don't want to use hints, but it's not something good, because most likely that means that you missed a tiny barely-visible thingie somewhere, and you will just sit in frustration till you'll finally notice it.Other than that, this game is quite nice, and it totally worth the price if you just want a short nice atmospheric mystery experience."

,Recommended,425580,33599837,Posted: 16 July,all,dotHacker,"Hot off the heels ofThe Room, this direct sequel picks up where the last left off. It follows both in story and gameplay to deliver more of what made the first one great: manipulating all manner of improbable mechanical contraptions to win your freedom.Pros- Sharp, high-resolution graphics. Has settings to support low end, too.- Ambient music that fits the mood and is never intrusive.- A hint system that you can disable at your own pace- The creative touchscreen inspired controls are back, and are a breeze to use- A variety of locations, unlike the first installmentCons- Quite short. 2-5 hours tops.- Virtually no replayability, since the puzzles and solutions are all the same.- Being a direct sequel, it largely is more of the same, so if you're looking to be amazed, you might be disappointed that there aren't too many new ideas in this one.- The next to last chapter isn't a room or puzzle at all. I believe it is there to set up the ending, but it really serves little purpose.In case you aren't familiar withThe Room, the story follows you, the unnamed protagonist, in search of a vanished researcher who was chasing after the legendary element ""null."" You are stuck in a series of rooms, all belonging to different places and times.The Room Twobrings this short tale to a conclusion, but it's still a delightful time if you enjoy working with your hands. The game involves ""safe cracking"" all manner of mechanical wonders to try to escape the room. What makes it particularly unique is that it was one of the first on mobile devices, so it has a realistic feel, since you need to turn keys, flip levers, and so on, using touchscreen gestures.If you're new to the series, do pick up the original first, although it is not necessary to enjoy this installment. And much like the first, I still recommend picking this up on sale. It's quite short, and there's no variation to the content on replay, so much like a fine wine, savor it while it lasts.If you are reading devs, please bring Room Three to steam as well. Fullscreen PC versions bring it much more to life.Achievement hunters: This is an easy 100% (simply complete the game)"
,Not Recommended,425580,32797599,Posted: 25 June,all,Phil Blank,"Honestly a step down from 'The Room'. Puzzles are much less satisfying and you spend the majority of the game clicking/dragging various gizmos so the game can reward you by zooming in on the next gizmo you need to click/drag. I'm glad their gizmos are fun to toy with, but I'd prefer if they were attached to actual puzzles.Speaking of puzzle design, this game seems to forget a lot of the design rules for puzzle rooms. At one point you're forced to solve the same puzzle four times in a row. It doesn't even get harder, it's just the same puzzle four times. Some of the elements you need to click aren't properly lit or are designed to look like background elements (I'm looking at you, poorly textured jar on the final level). I feel like I spent most of my time searching for puzzles instead of solving puzzles, especially in the final room where nearly a dozen puzzles are displayed at once despite only one being solveable at that time.It's not a bad game, but it's a disappointing step down from 'The Room' and it doesn't deserve its 'overwhelmingly positive' rating."

But again, it isn't without some head scratching and problem solving. Also, it seemed early on that it was going to have a bit more length but ended up almost exactly the same length as the first. Those were my two biggest knocks against The Room; Short and only a mild challenge. The Room Two delivers the same in those departments.It also brings back everything good about The Room as well. While The Room Two features a little more of a ""creepy"" or ""spooky"" atmosphere, it is still as pretty and sleek as the first. Great style. I've never played the mobile version but things are clearly cleaned up and ported well here. Runs as clean as a whistle and the simple mouse controls are smooth. Sure I wanted more of a challenge but its still a very clever game that is cleverly designed. The developers know what they're shooting for with these titles and they execute it well.

It is both simpler and more complex than the Room was, and it is still a highly recommended puzzle game.Long version:As its title suggests, The Room Two is the direct sequel of a clever little puzzle game calledThe Room, both released originally for mobile devices, before they were remade fully for PC.This time around the title bears more meaning, as the mechanical boxes of the first game have been replaced with entire mystery rooms, where several small “stations” serve as pieces of the current puzzle—and usually only of them can be considered an enigma box.Broadening the playing field like this adds a variety in gameplay, but it also means that all small segments are a lot simpler by themselves. The result is something that is more tedious, yet strangely not as challenging as the original, but even these drawbacks couldn’t take away all the excitement that makes The Room Two a highly recommended game for anyone."

The puzzles seem way more simple, as if you can easily intuitively know where to go and what to look at next, and how to solve it. The largest example I can give for this is a part where you must navigate a map, and instead of cunningly making it some kind of riddle, they just laid out how to do it. It felt like I was just following instructions laid out for me, and this was not the only part that contained ""clues"" like this.Difficulty aside, one other thing that really tugged at me was the buggy controls when interacting with some objects. There are specific parts where you must precicely control levers or dials, but cannot due to the fact that when you grab hold of it, it decides to flail around in every direction possible at mach speed. I'm not entirely sure if it was just my game personally messing up, or if it's everyone. If it is the later, I hope they release a patch for it because messing with certain objects took such a long time that it added about 45 minutes onto my playtime, and the extra time was certainly not enjoyable.In the end, if you really enjoyed The Room and want more of it, go ahead and grab The Room Two. It's only five dollars, so there's not much harm even if it's not as good as the first game. If you didn't care for the first game either way, then maybe you should save that five bucks and use it on something more useful."

The story again was subtle, which could be followed by finding and reading letters placed throughout each room.There was a different sort of presence as well, which felt more spooky and less friendly/hopeful than before. At times there was an eeriness that felt like there was someone else keeping watch from a secret place, as opposed to chasing after the hope of company in the previous game. Again, the change was good.However, I did find some of the puzzles to be more complex/difficult than they needed to be.

But - nothing wrong with that its still very interesting and fun, just, not really what I expected after playing the first game.Now - I`m bad, very bad at puzzle games, and I was struggling with the first game, here - I did everything just fine with out any help - I think this part is really easier or more intuitive, took me less time to figure it out on my own than the first game with guide.Still, very recommended but not as much as the first Room."

I'm glad I waited. The graphics are so crisp and sharp you could peel an apple with them.While I found""The Room Two""to be much easier than""The Room"", this may be simply down to now understanding how the general mechanics of""The Room""function and the nature of the game within its own little universe. It took me about 3 hours to beat both games; however, this one ""felt"" much faster. Perhaps it's the residual effects of the euclidean horrors. We may never know.""The Room Two""is much spookier than its predecessor, and I greatly enjoyed that. While the first game felt a little more disjointed in its locations, this game seems to have a bit more reason to your placement in time and space; however, this comes with a slight change in gameplay. Instead of focusing on one heavy-handed puzzle box at a time, you now must switch through several locations within an area.""The Room Two""resembles that of a ""room escape"" more than a ""puzzle box"" game.This isn't a bad thing, per se (I am an enormous fan of room escapes, both real-life and digital); however, I feel that the enormous novelty of the hideously complex, singular boxes in""The Room""became dumbed down to the point of it almost being like ""every other room-escape adventure"". Don't get me wrong. This is a nitpick.""The Room Two""is just more of what I enjoyed about""The Room"", and I will never damper on a well-made adventure game (which this is).That said, there was just something very unique and special about the novelty of the singular boxes in""The Room""that did not quite carry-over to this very deserving sequel, no matter how I continued to ruthlessly devour it.

There were very few instances where I really had to sit and think about (or hunt around for) what to do next.  In some cases, that's because the solutions are often very ""literal"" (or perhaps ""intuitive""), in the sense that objects do exactly what they appear to do, and in many cases you're explicitly told or shown what to do and you just have to find where to do it.  Perhaps my experience in The Room prepared me for The Room Two's puzzles, but I believe developers (especially those of puzzle games) should design sequels that presume the player has experienced the games that came before and ratchet up the challenge accordingly.That said, I still enjoyed the 3 hours it took me to complete The Room Two.  Even if it wasn't a complete brain-twister, there's the same extreme level of polish found in the Steam release of The Room.   There's defintely more ""rooms"" in contrast to the previous game's ""boxes"" and it's all gorgeous to look at.   It's obvious that the game was originally designed for a touch interface, with an abundance of handles to pull, objects to spin, knobs to twist, and secret panels to slide, but those interactions still give a sense of weight and presence even when using the mouse.If you enjoyed The Room and don't go in expecting the sequel to tie your brain in knots, then you'll probably enjoy coasting through The Room Two.I'm eagerly anticipating the Steam version of The Room Three, whenever it's ready."

If you are thinking about getting ""The Room Two"" do yourself a favor and play the first one ""The Room"".The Room and The Room Two are both really cool and interesting puzzle games. The environment you are in, to the way you play and the puzzles you solve really puts you like you're there and it’s like if you where the one to do the challenges you are faced with. All the puzzles use different elements and a wide variety of props and machinery to really make some unique and special ""Room's"" of obscure and interesting tests to overcome. The biggest difference from the two games are that the new Room Two are more open and the environment are bigger. That means you are faced with more set pieces and areas instead of less very detailed sets. That doesn’t mean though that it’s any less interesting or any less of a challenge, it simply means you have to think a little different like how the big picture fits together with all the small pieces.The graphics of this game looks truly outstanding, from the puzzles to the individual pieces as well as the cut scenes and the environment. Every single piece have an immense amount of details and there is an extensive amount of small pieces that no matter how little meaning they have are with great detail and structure. The story also have a great flow and you feel intrigued about the whole situation like what is happening? What this place is? And why am I here? The biggest downside and maybe in my opinion its only downside is the length of the game because even though the story and the puzzles are great it feels like it is over to soon. When I first saw that, it had more achievements I thought it would mean more content since in both games the achievements are an indicator for how many chapters there are and it got me thrilled. Sadly, it turned out that that even though there were more chapters the length of them were shorter as well.Therefore, my conclusion is, this is truly a unique, well made, good looking puzzle game and it is in my opinion worth every penny but with that said it is a little short but that’s primarily the only downside I can see with this game since I really enjoyed it and I think it’s a really great title.Have a nice day hope this helped another plus is it’s a really easy 100% game :)"

,Recommended,425580,24975229,"Posted: 17 August, 2016",all,JacquesLeSauve,"Only two games in and this is already easily becoming one of my favourite series to play on Steam. Little under a year ago, I posted myreview of the first gamewhere I sang its praises as a puzzle game about discovery and atmosphere more so than about testing one's knowledge or skill. Everything I said about the previous title largely stands true for this outing as well, but this time they've taken off the kid gloves and upped the scale, along with the challenge.The biggest change this time around is we are no longer confined to studying a single, increasingly sprawling contraption in each chapter. Now, each one consists of an entire room with multiple points of interest for you to live out your Sherlock Holmes role-playing fantasies to. You're still kind of rooted to the spot, but you can zoom in and out on objects and view them in detail from most angles. Tap on suspicious looking panels or mechanisms, uncover an object or key, find the next device to use it on, then rinse and repeat until you open up an exit and move on to the next room.It's the rooms themselves that I like so much more than that last time around. We seem to be taken on something of a history lesson of the origins of the discovery of the mystical world we're trying to escape from and the people involved in acquiring that knowledge and the dark paths it took them down. One moment we might find ourselves below the deck of a ship, the next might be in a parlour as the setting for a séance, or in a laboratory experimenting with reanimating the dead. And, thankfully, it still maintains the high production values as the first game throughout.The increased challenge doesn't necessarily come from the puzzles (though they have been ramped up), but more from how much more deviously things are hidden. It may test your patience a little bit more, but everything still seems pretty fair and more often than not your next step will be signposted, albeit subtly.There are six chapters to complete (well, it's really more like five real ones and a short build up sequence to the final chapter) and little real replay value beyond that. But even clocking in at around three hours, I think the price is fair and I was left more than satisfied with my final experience.I can pretty much only echo my verdict of my review of the previous game for this one - a great puzzle game that could easily be recommended for just about everyone, ""casual"" and ""hardcore"" alike, and I'm really looking forward to future titles hopefully coming to Steam, too."

The Room taught me the mechanics, while The Room Two took me through the motions. You make faster associations, you have a better idea what you could interact with and there's a fair amount of repetition as well. I enjoyed going through the motions, but The Room is the more challenging game by default.I've always thought it would be great to selectively wipe my memory clean, just so I can watch The Game (1997) for the first time, a second time. I wish I could also wipe my memory of experiencing this and the previous game, just so I can enjoy The Room Three more. What I'm saying is, I can't view these puzzles objectively and even though it feels like they're easier puzzles regardless of my previous experience, I can't say for sure.In real life you have ""escape rooms"", which are more and more popular these days, though I've yet to enter and escape one myself. I haven't played The Room or its sequel on a tablet or a phone, with the tilting and the zooming and the turning and the swiping and honestly, it makes more sense to play them that way, cos on the PC it turns into another point and click game. Not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just not as unique here. I suppose they can make the rooms even more interactive and I doubt a VR game is that far off in the future, but seriously, how long can you keep this fresh and interesting?I would love to play a set of VR puzzles in rooms like these one day, cos real life escape rooms have their own limitations. These sort of games seem like a perfect fit for VR. There's a surprising amount of story in The Room Two, with cutscenes and everything, though I rarely paid attention to reading the letters and notes. If you enjoyed The Room then you will pick this up sooner or later, cos it scratches a rare itch, if you will, so it feels really good to scratch that itch."

Solutions weren't intuitive.I didn't use the hints at all in the first game because no matter how stumped I was, I knew there was a reason behind every placement and item. Nothing was superfluous. In this game, I had to resort to using hints frequently because some things were completely unrelated to one another.

With no real story arch to keep you fixated on the end, it starts to feel like you're running through an endless dungeon maze.So while I did not find this game to be playable for more than 2 hours at a time, I would still recommmend it for the beautiful scene design and the intriguing puzzle construction.

And it does so in the most wonderfully magical way.I have played through The Room 1 more times than one would think strictly necessary just to admire the artwork and design, and I suspect I'm in for a similar fate with The Room 2.Granted, I still like the original better than the sequel (not quite as gloomy, and more emphasis on the physical safes) but I'm still enjoying the hell out of The Room 2.So do yourself a favor.

It's hard to say if is better than the first one, but I can say for sure that it is, at the very least, just as good.From the first one, they improved it's atmosphere, it's graphics, the controls, which are more fluid, added more levels (3, IIRC), and the complexity of the puzzles, in which most of them uses the ""whole"" room.

That said, it's a great port and the only glitch that I encountered turned out to not be a glitch, but instead me doing something in the wrong order and it didn't work the way that I thought it would.The puzzles are solid with enough clues spread into the levels that you shouldn't have too much of a difficulty working through everything without having to use spoilers. Just make sure that you twist, pull, and push everything in the entire level, including anything in your inventory (The only time I had to use a walkthrough was when I forgot that you can change the items in your inventory as well).In my opinion, it's worth the full asking price, but for those with a bit less budget to play with...

Along the way, you learn about the story behind thetreasure, which typically sheds some light of both the importance and dangers of what you're after. The unraveling of each room's story with its eerie environment provides a great sprinkle of horror into the game, to the point where any door opening or strange sound is enough to send chills down your spine.In terms of mechanics, it's a point-and-click game with mostly physical and mechanical puzzles. The point-and-click mechanism works very well as it allows the player to focus on the important areas, diving into the central element of the game: the puzzles.The puzzles are challenging but well designed: you'll be forced to keenly observe the environment, come up with insightful ways to use items, and figure out how different objects fit with each other. In return, you'll be faced with balanced puzzles with no cheap solutions, that will provide inmense satisfaction once you figure them out. The game also provides optional hints if you get stuck, so the game never becomes frustating.I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzles, and to horror fans who prefer a creepy atmosphere over jump scares.Here's my playthrough of the first chapter:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5xudLMCBxo&index=1&list=PLI-TR5iFiKtD2OG-2b69VVpvCz7-kzxDq"

,Recommended,425580,24364243,"Posted: 16 July, 2016",all,genoforprez,"TLDR: If you played the original, expect some new additions that may or may not be to your liking, but the essential fun of the first game is still here and still fantastic.The Room Two is a pretty good sequel to the original game. It has a lot of the same flavor that I loved about the original, but it also tries some new things. However, the new things are kind of a bittersweet addition.As for what stays the same: You are still locked in a room trying to open weird puzzle boxes with hidden compartments and complicated mechanisms. The puzzles and their solutions still have that inimitable Myst-like quality that is so hard to find in other games.As for what's different:1. Instead of trying to solve one hugely complicated puzzle box in a single room, you are instead moved through a series of different rooms. Instead of each room having a single puzzle box to solve, there are instead different ""points of interest"" around the room that serve as sort of puzzle stations. This gives The Room Two much more of an ""escape the room"" or point-and-click adventure flavor than the original game. Some will consider this a positive, and in some ways I agree it adds an interesting newness. But it also introduces certain problems, because....2. Due to the shift to a focus on ""puzzle rooms"" instead of a huge puzzle box, The Room Two introduces some classic point-and-click frustrations that it mostly managed to avoid in the original game. The biggest frustration of all is the dreaded pixel hunt. The Room allows you to click on points of interest to zoom in and interact, but you can't interact with things until you are fully zoomed in on them, and it is not always clear whether a point in the room can be clicked on to zoom in or not. Sometimes a point in the room is not a place you can zoom in on at first, but then later you can. Sometimes the ""hit zone"" of the area you have to click to zoom in can be kind of small. I won't say that it happens in every room or every puzzle, but there are definitely a few places in the game (and DEFINITELY on the last puzzle) where I felt like the game was only ""difficult"" because I was tediously clicking every pixel on the screen trying to find something I was missing rather than the more interesting difficulty of trying to solve an actual puzzle.3. The Room Two introduces a ""viewing lens"" which functions as an eye/lens of truth (i.e. certain things are only visible when you are looking through the lens). I don't really mind the lens of truth idea in certain games, but I don't think it was a great addition to The Room. It just compounds that frustrating pixel-hunting feeling. Yes, you've searched everything, but have you looked at everything THROUGH THE LENS???? It's one more thing that turns the game into more of a ""hidden object"" type experience than a puzzle type experience. I wasn't super into this new idea.But despite the new twists on the old formula being bittersweet, and despite the last puzzle room in particular making me especially grumpy with the level of pixel hunting, I have to say that all of the Myst-like things I loved about the original The Room are still there. 98% of the puzzles are fun, intuitive, and compelling.If you played the original, expect some new additions that may or may not be to your liking, but the essential fun of the first game is still here and still fantastic.7) A classic, essential, and/or must-buy game that is worth full price.6) A good game that is worth the full price.5) A pretty good game worth checking out--especially if discounted.4) A fairly good game, but I'd recommend buying it discounted.3) Not great, but a few redeeming qualities. Only buy if heavily discounted.2) Only worth checking out if you are dangerously curious.1) Avoid at all costs."

In The Room II, there were multiple puzzles in a single room and the object is to solve them all to move to another room. It's a great concept and it worked really well most of the time. When moving from puzzle to puzzle, sometimes the camera wanted to focus somewhere I wasn't expecting it to. This sometimes got a little dizzying when getting pieces of one puzzle to fit into another puzzle. The only other downside was the length, but for $5, I felt I got my money's worth from it.

If you look at the trailer and think it looks good then you should have a good time. It tackles story perfectly by being completely optional and something to read though if you'd like as the main point of the game is to tackle really really interesting puzzles. Like puzzles?

The scenery is a bit more varied this time around and the rooms a bit more tricky. The puzzles themselves are fairly simple like the previous game and really are more a matter of finding the right part than figuring out some complex behavior (save for a few exceptions like the skull coin game).Additionally, like its predecessor, the game rewards exploration and you will very quickly run into a proverbial dead end if you do not thoroughly explore every room both with your own eyes and the included special lens.For me, this game was worth the $5 and I’m looking forward to playing the next (final?) game in the series, whenever they get around to porting it to PC."

The puzzles don't try to be head scratchers, they don't have multiple solutions, they are just rooms of well designed boxes that slide and twist and open to reveal morre puzzles. You can play each chapter or even the whole game in a sitting and aren't punished for using hints or rewarded for not using them. It's just a fun, relaxing game with an honestly pretty sinister storyline.I've played each of the three games mobile first and then bought the first two a second time on Steam just to be able to experience them again in higher fidelity and give more support to Fireproof Games. I'm really happy they decided to bring this one to Steam and hope The Room Three's port is in the works.

,Recommended,425580,24147968,"Posted: 6 July, 2016",all,Caustic_Apathy,"Review with No SpoilersI'd like to begin by saying that I highly recommend The Room Two to anybody who enjoys puzzle games. I believe that this game is one of the few games that does puzzling excellently. Never have I played a game quite like this, and I'm somewhat sad that I've already finished it. That being said, there are some things that I absolutely adored about this game, some qualms that I had with it that I feel the first game did better, and a few things that I believe the creators could improve upon. As such, I've decided to divide this rather lengthy review into three parts with a nice TL;DR at the bottom.What I LovedAmbiance: The Room Two is a work of art. The atmosphere in The Room Two is inquisitive. You're surrounded by all sorts of trinkets, most of which you can directly interact with. The mood is somber, just the right amount of eerie, and simply perfect for the story found scattered throughout the various notes you encounter. There is no background music, and I find that to be perfect. The quiet permits you to concentrate as you tinker around looking for the next secret compartment. That being said, the game is not entirely silent. Sounds will play upon discovery of new game elements, or simply to alert you during some key moment.Story: The story is only just present enough, and just detailed enough, to keep you completely hooked without distracting you from the main focus of the game: the puzzles. I am a big fan of the scattered nature of the story, keeping it confined to the notes you find here and there left behind by the mysterious AS. There are some other tidbits of story left behind by other unknown characters in letters and notes that provide you with only enough information to keep you guessing. Honestly, the story in The Room and The Room Two is an excellent implementation of the policy Less is More.Puzzles: Unlike in The Room, the puzzles in The Room Two are not confined to a single box. Instead, you can explore the entire area and mess around with various puzzle units that must work in unison. I loved how the puzzles had to work together to get you from one room to the next. Just like in The Room, the puzzles are very satisfying to solve, and every little secret uncovered is a reward. The difficulty of the puzzles is perfect. I am not a big fan of hints, so I deactivated them, and I was able to solve the puzzles just fine. An important aspect of a puzzle is that help be available when wanted, but help should never be needed. I could go on forever on how excellent the puzzles themselves were, but you'll have to experience them for yourself to understand what I mean.Interface: One of the simplest I've ever seen. There's not much to do. Literally everything can be achieved with the mouse, and all of the controls are very intuitive. Furthermore, a lovely tutorial is provided that explains the mechanics clearly and succinctly.What The Room Did BetterI actually preferred how The Room confined the puzzles to single units rather than to several units spread throughout a room. I feel that spreading out the puzzle to several units watered down the units themselves. One of the things that I loved most about The Room is how intricate the puzzles were. They felt as though there were infinite compartments and keyholes. The level of detail was simply mesmerizing, and the sheer impossibility of the spatial dimensions felt like part of the magic of the game. By spreading the puzzle to various units, I feel that the magic was lost. There are few spatial violations in The Room Two, and the detail dedicated to the units was lost.That said, I understand that this is mostly personal preference, and I don't feel that the game should lose any points because of it.I further felt that the shift in focus from a single puzzle box to various made some of the puzzle elements required to advance a bit difficult to find. Some parts didn't feel puzzling so much as they felt a tad frustrating, and upon finding them I would find myself thinking ""ugh, I just didn't see this thing in that dark corner"" or ""I had no idea I could interact with that.""QualmsMy biggest qualm was how some messages couldn't be repeated. This game requires a lot of rapid clicking, and sometimes when you click on something you'll get a message, but you'll accidentally skip it because you're clicking so much. You then cannot replay the message. I think the easiest solution would just be to not allow the player to skip messages. Considering that they only play once, this shouldn't be annoying to the player. That said, this was only an issue with some messages, not all.Another issue was that sometimes when trying to move the camera, you'd just accidentally press on a knob or something and instead activate some small cutscene or transition rather than getting the camera to move. Simply put: I wish the camera behaved a bit better.Overall, I feel that this game was amazing, and I honestly believe that more could be done with this concept. I really wouldn't mind seeing something bigger come out of this. Perhaps a game in which the story is fully fleshed out. I'd definitely pay for that.TL;DR: Excellent game. Excellent story. Some things I feel were done better in The Room, but The Room Two is a game that I wholeheartedly recommend."

It had rich details, the puzzle mechanics clicked beautifully, and there were plenty of ""oh why didn't I think of that?"" moments when I hit the clue button.This game, unfortunately, only really nailed the rich environment.  The puzzle mechanics moved away from ""figure this out"" to ""figure out where this thing goes.""  The idea to expand from a singular object of focus to multiple areas in a room gives it an ""escape the room"" kind of feel to it, but detracts from the overall experience.  Too much space to explore, and far too much detail.  A player should never be left wondering ""Is this part of the puzzle? Or meaningless background detail?"" The clue button in this game was less of ""why didn't I think of that"" to ""I would never EVER see that connection"" or ""I didn't even know that was supposed to be part of the puzzle, isn't that background?""The puzzle design here feels like bottom-of-the-barrel.  There were no moments where you had to figure out what path to take when multiple were presented.  The first game had many puzzles where you had to navigate an object past obstacles or through paths, and you felt really good when you solved it, sometimes backtracking to find the correct path.  This game only had one such puzzle, and the physics engine and the control scheme interfered pretty hard with executing the solution.  Nearly every puzzle in this game was a case of ""I found an object, let's spend the next several minutes finding where it goes.""Clue no. 1: ""You found object X.  Where does it go?"" Thanks, game.  I hadn't figured that out </sarcasm>Clue no. 2: ""I wonder if object X could be used to do <thing>?"" Thanks, game, that was already obvious.Clue no. 3: ""Use object X on thing Y.""  Greaaaaaaaat.Pursuing the whole ""find where this goes"" mantra of design, I found myself just rapid-clicking on every thing of even remote interest in every room.  I found it especially infuriating when I saw something that appeared to be part of the puzzle, and couldn't click on it to inspect it more closely.  I would then discount the thing as ""not part of the puzzle because the game clearly won't let me look at it"", only to find out later (from one of those brilliant clues) that I should have gone back to it, only to find out that the object is NOW more closely inpsectable, now that's it's important to the puzzle.  That was a grave injustice in this game when compared to the last one.  It was impossible in this game to make serious notes about what stuff to return to with new info, because the game literally wouldn't let you look at things until you needed them.The use of the lens also felt really underwhelming in this game as well.  There was little to no meaningful usage of it, and in one case, was used only briefly to notice the tiniest of features that could be easily missed, but was absolutely mandatory for a puzzle solution.  The first game used the lens to help the player find things that would be obscure without it, but this game uses the lens mechanic poorly.  Was this even the same design team? I finally just brute-forced the final puzzle answer in the last room, instead of waiting for the clue to tell me where to find the last piece of hidden information.I got this game on sale for just under $3.  I feel like it was wasted.  The tutorial showed promise, with the potential for multiple simultaneous areas of investigation and the creepy vibes foreshadowing an interesting story, but quickly became nothing short of intense, repeated frustration from the puzzles of the first level onward.  Save your money and take a pass on this game."

Played The Room and The Room two back to back and was only dissapointed once, when the second one was over. Puzzles where quite a bit more challenging this time as they opened up multiple puzzle surfaces at once so you had to figure out what was held where, what was useful where, what step was next, etc. Alot more atmospheric in this one in my opinion (especially in the first and fourth levels, had me on edge the entire game).

They never take me very long (1.5-2.5 hours), but they're always worth the price of admission during a sale. These puzzles are well constructed, thoughtful, and most importantly: satisfying to solve. There are only a few occassions where the solution made me react with a ""Oh c'mon, really?"", but I can count the number of times this happened on a single hand. I'd consider these few occassions sigh-worthy rather than annoying or unfair; these events made me heave a sigh and then continue onward. These games never drag on with achievement and since they're impossible to fail (unless you quit or need to rely on hints), it's great that accomplishment never takes attention away from the gameplay.Controls are just as fine as I could ask for, but I can't help but hope for a VR version of The Room, someday.Finally, there is a surprise at the end of the game, and while it's super interesting and unexpected, it is excrutiatingly laggy. I can't help but imagine it was crafted for mobile or something, but while running the game on highest settings with a 970 and 4790K, I really cannot see how this ""surprise"" ending made it past playtesting, it's so horrendous.All that said, I have to recommend this game, but definitely wait for it to drop to its sale price of $2.49.

That's less than a typical movie, and it took a few hours to complete. I recommend it at that price, but you'll get a great deal in a Steam Sale.It has a lot of great puzzles, making you take a moment to think about the next step, and in some cases a single revelation allows you to steamroll remaining puzzles in the room.It does have some problems, mostly due to being a phone/tablet game ported to the PC.- The mouse-only controls can get annoying when viewing items; some sort of axis modifier/holder would greatly improve this- What can be interacted, and how, is too often guessing/random clicking. As an example: one puzzle was started by rotating an existing knob, but the knob resembled previous puzzles where you had to find the missing half of it. Randomly trying to interact I somehow missed being able to turn it, and it took a hint for me to try again and move on.- Some interactions were repeated multiple times in the same location and became tedious. One puzzle sequence requires you to type out words many times, and is made all the more annoying by forcing you to type with the mouse (rather than allowing you to just use your own keyboard to type it out)If there's a Room Three, it would be great for these to be addressed."

It's nothing terribly complex if you played similar games before, but each of the main chapters should take you up to 1 hour.It does have the tendency to end up with you clicking and pulling the mouse in different directions on everything to see what you can interact with. But since there is no real context clues on what is clickable and since the controlls are not 100% responisve all the time when you try to move things, this can get a little frustrating.

The interface is as smooth as the previous game too, and the atmosphere is slightly creepier (which is good)!This time, the puzzles are more challenging, and more diverse.A major departure from the original that adds to there are multiple puzzle pieces spread throughout the room that you can interact with (these are usually lit up in the otherwise dark rooms, so you can identify them easily.Graphics are excellent, and pushed to bolder uses (usually strange and disturbing supernatural occurences).I'd strongly recommend buying this, and I'd also recommend buying the first game and playing it first (not that you need to in order to understand the puzzle mechanics- a brief tutorial runs you through all you need to know in each game and the interface is really easy to use)."

The Room Two on steam.I am not sure how this connects to the first one, but if you enjoyed The Room, you might like this one as well. I managed to get through The Room Two by only asking for help twice. But that is not to say the puzzles are much more difficult to solve. They're just more obscure, which slows the flow somewhat. You'll spend most of the time looking for pieces, and the puzzles themselves does not feel as intricate and clockworky as the first installment. However: instead of having just one box to solve in every chapter, there are now several, and pieces found in one box might be needed to open another.All in all, The Room Two is not just a repeat of The Room.

There are more levels in this sequel, and the ""rooms"" are more fleshed out. You're not focused on a single object; instead, there are multiple points of interest in each room that you'll bounce between in order to make progress.It took me a little longer to beat this one than the first, and that's not just because there are more levels. The challenge has been upped because of the additional areas used to figure your way out. Fortunately, hints are still there to give you a helping hand when things seem like a dead end.The only level I didn't like was the fifth level. It is purposefully short, and completely underwhelming after what I went through to get past the fourth level.I've heard there's a third game in the series for mobile devices, and the developers are waiting to see how this one does before they consider putting the effort into porting over the next one.

However, this episode has got much less exposition and is far more mysterious - the ""what the hell is going on?"" kind. Although the level variety in this sequel  is much more diverse (many different settings), the progression did feel a bit disconnected to me as a result of jumping though space and time after each room.Regarding the puzzles: The possibilities are multiplicated in the sequel since you switch between locations (e.g. from a table in the center of the room, to a chest in the corner). It might lead to a bit of confusion at times, but it does make for some interesting circumstances. The difficulty felt slightly lesser than in the first game, paired with slightly more direct (in pointing the player in the right direction) compared to the first game.One other thing of note is this game comes with a fair amount of creepy/disturbing vibes. The more faint hearted may feel a shiver or two at some points - but horror is obviously not a main point of this game and the player needn't worry much.All in all, I do wish the sequel is a bit longer with more content, but I did have a good time playing through all the chapters and at this price the purchase is more than worthwhile.

It doesn't. It actually made it far worse. The biggest issue I have with this sequel is its attempt to be creepier. The atmosphere of the first game was far more inviting. But what makes this even more frustrating is that when you look more closely, a lot of the horror elements of the sequel are pretty empty. You open a drawer or solve a puzzle and suddenly there is an adrenaline-inducing sharp noise that is supposed to freak you out. And it does. But for absolutely no reason. So much of the game relies on this manipulation of the player's emotions through sounds and music, but the game lacks the substance to back this up. And of course, my other criticism is the same as it was for the previous game - the puzzles are not puzzles. There was the potential to make things more interesting by opening up the room to other areas, but unfortunately, no thought is required to solve anything. It's simply finding objects, and it becomes pretty dull after only a short time."

Altough the game is very enjoyable and the story that connects the levels is rather interesting, unfortunately it has a little/close to none replay value, at least for me.Still I highly recommend it! Keep up the good work, I'd definitely love to see more!"

,Recommended,425580,29301261,Posted: 16 January,all,MatsuoBasho,"The Room Two, as the title self explains, is the second installment of the series, gradually being ported as PC version.Be aware that there is no chronological succession, you can play them in any order as they take place in a different contextual environment.I played the first episode, therefore my review will be highly influenced by both gaming experiences.There are many similarity with the The Room One as well as differences.The game mechanics are obviously preserved. You will need to find your way to solve the puzzles through levers, hidden mechanisms, and a lot of wit. The enthralling atmosphere of mystery with its beautiful soundtrack is very familiar, and it really helps to get in the mood of the game. The puzzles may appear to be a bit simpler than the first title, perhaps due to the fact that the player already knows what to expect and how to operate the mechanisms. However, here come the differencies.The Room Two tends to be more story driven. While The Room One focused on puzzle solving, this episode has a very good story behind, and acts as a glue that keeps every level tied. This feature is translated into the game through the introduction of different types of puzzles that detatch from the original pattern; through the addition of numerous lore-based items; through a distinct division among the levels.I will avoid any kind of spoiler, as part of the experience is the feel of awe when you discover how to progress in the game. What you may want to know is that every stage of the game presents a wider area of play, with multiple puzzle structures (if they can be considered such) entwined. Some puzzles could be hard to grasp or notice at first because they may not appear objects that require invisetigation. You are really required to lok out of your schemes!Personally, I really liked it; I can't say I completely love it. My recommendation has a thumb partly up. The only small flaws I noticed are mere subjective opinions.The recurrent hints given when you are stuck pondering appears to be too recurrent and too helpful. The best part of the game is trying to find every small detail and see if there is a small hidden button to press; sometimes the final hints clearly tell you what to do (thankfully hints are optional, so don't look up them unless strictly necessary!), rendering the game in a very linear experience if you decide to rely on them.Another small observation concerns the game pace. At the very begin I perceived it was way too easy and it required a couple of levels before things actually started being interestingly complicated, and considering the few amount of stages, I can define it a slow start.This title is a turn from the previous installment, therefore its perception could be welcomed either positively or negatively.To everyone reading: Play it! That's the best advice I can give. Reviewers will either love this game to death or dislike it according to personal tastes. Even when not on sale (and it usually is) is extremely cheap. Fun is ensured, and even though it's a 2.5/3 hour experience, I can reassure that it is extremely worth it!"

I didn't do the usual path of checking reviews, watching the little videos and then debating with myself for ten minutes about whether or not it was worth the money. This developer makes excellent, high-quality games.Not surprisingly, I found the game to be fantastic - but I was a little surprised to find that I like this so much more than the original The Room (which i had enjoyed immensely).  There's an obvious progression in the storyline, which they've done an excellent job of building depth and mystery around - giving you the sense that what you learn about ""The Room"" is just the beginning. However, there is also a definite progression from the original game in that you're working each ""stage"" in a larger environment.  Instead of a stage being a single object, it's now a whole room with multiple objects and machinery to work.  My hope is that the trend continues so that The Room 3 (or 4) has you working a full location."

They're ports of iOS games, but the PC editions have had some extra work done graphically and the controls work pretty well. The gameplay is somewhat like an Escape the Room game, but all of the puzzles typically revolve around various centerpieces in the rooms that work like puzzle boxes. Compared to the first game I had more issues seeing things in the dark lightning, but that might've just been my gamma settings.

The rooms are interesting to explore and have expanded to include more stations that need to be solved.

His father had quite the collection of games on floppy discs, and there was one in particular that we went back to time and time again.  It's name was King's Quest.  It made such a lasting impact on me that the adventure genre quickly became one of my favorites, as it still is today.  Over the course of time, I watched with dismay the genre dying, and I thought it would be dead forever.Thankfully, I was wrong.  There was a resurgence due to evergrowing independent gaming scene.  Tim Schafer and Ron Gilbert were back in the limelight.  But even before their reappearance, there was the advent of escape the room games that began popping up on the web to play.  I played a lot of these, most notably the Submachine series.  These types of games were very popular, and it didn't hurt that they were easy to make.With the advent of mobile gaming, many of these games were made for smartphones, which made sense for you only needed to use one button.  When I learned about The Room I was excited, as it seemed to be an escape the room game with an atmosphere reminiscent of Zork: Grand Inquisitor, but I was disheartened as I don't have a phone capable of playing games.So I happy to find, one day, The Room 1 on Steam.  I had know idea they had ported it over to the computer.  I quickly bought it, and loved every minute of it, and it didn't hurt that it was a good price.As for it's sequel, I enjoyed parts of it, but not like the first.  It didn't really do anything new, just felt like you were playing an expansion of the first.  If you played escape the room games on the web, you know that some developers churn them out, all of them feeling the same or having a huge amount of pixel-hunting with the mouse.  While this game didn't feel churned out as much as those, I did have the feeling I was pixel-hunting at times or clicking on things that I thought should be viewable.  Also, most of the puzzles follow the same logic as the rest, which is also prominent in escape the room games - I knew exactly what the screwdriver was going to be used for.The one area where the game definitely improves on is the graphics, atmosphere and ambiance.  It's just great.  Even though I only sort of enjoyed it, I can't recommend it on a purely ""is it good"" scale.  It's mediocre.  However, if you liked the first, or the genre, and don't mind more of the same, you won't regret paying the five-dollars for it.  Even knowing you will burn through it in one sitting.  If it wasn't for the super low price, I wouldn't recommend it.With all that said, I am still hoping for The Room 3 to come this way as well, as it's supposed to be extremly good.  The reviews for it have all been outstanding, such as IGN giving it a 9.0, which you don't see much for mobile games.  If you want that to come to Steam, it might not be a bad idea to help the developers out with buying this game.As it stands, I'd give this game a 6/10.  For more expensive games, such a score would usually not earn the recommendation from me, especially knowing how expensive games get now a days."

Also some levels even have interactive set pieces(like a crossbow on the 3rd level) that you need to use to advance in the puzzles which was just super cool.I also love the feeling of goosebumps, and this game sure gave me that feeling throughout the entire thing.

The puzzles aren't THAT hard to figure out, and as there are no randomised elements, there is little replay value aside from playing with the switches and dials.The controls are okay, not as immersive as touch controls on mobile, but still a reasonable amount of interaction with the pieces.Instead of the better controls on mobiles, we get vastly superior graphics, which really enhance the atmosphere of this game which is eerie, borderline horror (though hopefully tame enough that those of a nervous disposition should still enjoy the thrill), and there are a few notes throughout to give a bit of context to the story although it's still quite mysterious up to this point.Overall, it is basically an extremely high quality 'escape the room' type game.

There is no logic or realism to the puzzles; it's just a matter of clicking on things until whatever arbitrary combination that the developer though of is accepted.

Definite improvement over what I had seen of the trailers for the original release.Audio yet again is also brilliant.Gameplay is more of the same which is not a bad thing.

The graphics are a lot better than I would have imagined a remastered mobile game to have; and the lighting definitely helps set the eerie vibe that runs throughout this game.The puzzles in this game have a good amount of difficulty and excel at challenging both your memory and ingenuity.  If they prove too difficult, however, there is a progressive help system that can save you from mindlessly clicking on every item in the room, hoping for a solution.  Not that I did that...  Anyway, the game is fairly episodic in its gameplay and can be tedious if puzzle boxes are not your thing.  This game is all about them.Lastly, I read some reviews that were angry at the seemingly missing story.  Although it is sparse, there is definitely a story in this game.  It is the final puzzle that ties everything together.  If you can piece together everything you’ve experienced over the course of this game, you will start to unravel the mystery that is The Room."

Really enjoyed the game but not quite as much as the first one.  Flitting from table to table in this one was a bit of a pain, I prefer the more contained approach of the first game.  Keeping all the action confined to a single table makes you less likely to miss small details.  Also I don't care for parts where the devs want you to find things in the backgrounds like a column or whatever, it might be easier to spot the cues that something's amiss in the background on mobile where the textures are less detailed but on PC there were a few spots I never would have found if not for the hints system.  Controls are still a bit wonky but I'm not really sure how they could be improved as long as the devs want to keep the odd camera system that's in the game.  As for the positives, atmosphere's even better than the first game, some really fun puzzles, great visuals, and a very nice ambient soundtrack.  Overall, a very fun adventure game and I hope that The Room Three gets ported a bit quicker than this one did."

There are maybe one or two levels where it's bearable and where the chain of ""puzzles"" still feels somewhat organic, but otherwise this is just a drag.When you have to rely on the hint system to actually have a sense of flow and not hit a wall everytime you make progress, there's something wrong with your game design.

It seemed like this one was more focussed on looks and setting than the last and the puzzles were not as difficult/interesting.I picked this up for $2.49, I don't think I would recommend it for any more than that though, especially following a dollar per hour content standard.Perhaps my fault with this one was comparing it to the first, and not letting it stand on its own, but I bought it knowing how much I enjoyed the first, and it is a sequel. I suppose I was just a bit disappointed.Pros:- great hint system- nice polish/ambiance- decent puzzles- One of the best of it's kind that I can think ofCons:- Not as good as The Room- Puzzles seemed easier than The Room- Shorter than The RoomPerhaps if the puzzles were just slightly harder, or there were just a few more chapters I would have been more satisfied, but it ended waaay earlier than I expected and I felt like I was left wanting more."

The Room Two's theme is more deeper, darker, scarier and more mysterious. I have played the first game, and I absolutely loved it. After the first game leaved me with a lot of questions that needed answers, i couldn't resist the urge to play the sequel. And I don't regret playing The Room Two, i loved it more than the first game.Pros:+Graphics were amazing and stunning. I specially loved the detail, those made the game look even more gorgeous.+The Sounds were amazing. The sounds were very effective emotionally also. Specially when you advance to a new chapter, the sounds gave me chills down my spine, just like in a horror game. And the music at the menu is very relaxing and feels a bit mysterious.+New puzzles, no puzzle were similar to the first game, which was very good indeed. The mechanics of the puzzles were more complicated, which i really liked it.+The Story. The story is amazing, it feels like you are a part of it. Specially when ""The Craftsman"" writes notes to you. Kind of breaks the forth wall, at least it felt like it.+The milieu is more complicated than the first game. You litearly go through space and time, which is cool.+A very good game for it's pricetag.Cons:-After i played The Room Two and went trough the ending, I was still left with questions (I would give examples but I don't wanna give spoilers to new players). Hopefully the devs make a sequel to this game.-The game was relatively brief. Make it a bit longer.In conclusion:The Room -series is not only a game, it's art. This, is something we gamers don't see everyday.

76561198307733544,Recommended,425580,31715574,Posted: 12 May,all,ardkore1992,"I absolutly loved this game.  It's not as Hellraiser as the first game as this one doesn't follow one puzzle box / table per room but rather the entire room becomes the puzzle.  This game references different movies such as Indiana Jones, The Ninth Gate, The Goonies, and I'm pretty sure I'm missing others.  Level 3 is especially Goonie-esk with its Rube Goldberg like devices and skull key (simmilar to Chester Copperpot's bone key).  The first game was quite easy as I ran it with the hints so for this one I turned the hints off.  The last 3 levels were the most challenging of the series.  The ending of the game reminded me of the Johnny Dep movie ""The Ninth Gate"" which was really cool.I would like to see in this series death traps like in Goonies and Indiana Jones.  I think it would make each puzzle more challenging as each time you die, you have to play the room over again.  Traps like ""Play The Bones"" in Goonies and the ""weight"" trap in Indiana Jones 1.  I think that would be a neat element.Probably the only real problem with this game is that the developers are mainly making this for the tablet.  The same problem exists for Pinball Arcade.  They take way too long to bring the game to Steam and these games were never released for the game systems.  I would rather see simaltanious releases on at least both the tablet and the PC.  Now I guess I have to wait a year to play The Room Three and two years to play The Room Four.  This really stinks as I really like this game series.  I think this is the most interesting video game I've ever played in recent years.  It's really something."
,Recommended,425580,31766361,Posted: 15 May,all,-NN-,"While the second game doesn't live up to the perfect crafting of the first because of its more cumbersome and less intuitive exploration of items, in some ways it improves on the original. The rooms are more expansive and less compact, which makes the game considerably harder (at least it did for me). The themes of the rooms are disparate though engaging, but they seem pieced together for show rather than fitting into a consistent artistic vision and narrative. In this sense, The Room Two fails to live up to some of the cogent perfection that the first game offers, but this is made up for by it being longer and, on balance, more difficult to beat. Although the designs of the episodes are disparate, two of them especially are just a joy to work through and are intriguing and brilliantly designed.The main issue is that in their expanding of their concept it can be awkward to interact with objects. I felt like I should be able to explore much more of certain objects first up but the game had difficulties in recognising some commands -- or rather, the richness of items is very much lacking compared to the first game because objectives are spread out over a much wider area, with several artefacts in the various singular rooms to explore. Instead of getting really stuck into the beautiful nuance and detail of single objects then, The Room 2 is more about interlinking tasks across different objects.So which game is better, The Room One or Two? I think The Room 2 is more replayable chapter by chapter, soaking in the ""biodomes"" of the game in what are quite extensive rooms to explore and complete. The Room 1 is the better game to play through in one sitting, with every chapter feeling so utterly connected and the holistic vision of the game shining through like a diamond.What we need is a game with the purpose and focus of the first game with the expansiveness and new puzzle innovations of the second game, without sacrificing the richness of interaction with the objects we can see on the screen.Duration (for myself)The Room: 3 hoursThe Room Two: 5.5 hoursUltimately, I don't think The Room Two is nearly twice as long as the first. Places where I got stuck on Two were not about difficult puzzles but about not being observant and vigilant enough in what are much bigger rooms to explore.8/10"

I highly recommend it, even though the mouse controls are still sluggish and cause errorous actions (seemy review on part 1for a more in-depth observation).Edit: The camera control is truly awful as it always flips to predetermined positions which makes navigating through the large rooms a majorly annoying endeavor. The further I play, the more annoying the camera handling gets. Forcing people into certain perspectives and making rotating such a pain is not desireable in a game that is based on those two mechanisms."

It's a few hours long, not quite twice as long as the first Room (which is wonderful as well).  The approach is slightly different, with a greater focus on interacting with different objects in a small space and inferring when to bring an object from one 'station' to another part of the room and use it there.  The graphics are updated a good bit from the previous game, and there's more impressive particle effects and animations and interludes, more cut-scenes, all that sort of stuff.There's more of a horror æsthetic but not to a degree that it would be troubling for most people.  There's one scene in particular that may put off someone that is very against the whole horror thing, but it's not an extreme sort of thing.  Personally, it was one of my favourite aspects of the game, this whole creepy, mysterious atmosphere.  It was like all the best atmosphere of classic Resident Evil and its puzzles, but with gameplay that is exclusivley puzzles and where the puzzles are infinitely more complex than Resident Evil's.They do have a timed hint feature that can be turned on and off, so if you think it may too hard for you, probably not.  The hints start out small and get bigger over time, and you have to click on them to see them.  It's very well done.There was an elegance in the first game that is eschewed in favour of intricacy here.  Neither is bad.  personal preference I suppose.The story is told in notes, and frankly, I don't think it's incredibly well told (same as the first game, more or less).  But that is the last thing on my mind when I play.  Everything else is just too engaging."

I finished it completely, but am left with surprised frustration and dissapointment. Frustration because of the lack of interaction and multiple possibilities (the game is completely restricted to only one possible solution). The story is vague, with a million loose ends and no development either of plot or characters but constantly makes general remarks about both.Many of the ''puzzles'' are not puzzles at all. For example, one puzzle seeks to pull a key from what can only be described as ''The gate of hell from which the demon's of doom invaded mars''. I mean it's frankly filled with amateur and novice level semiotics.The attempt at making the mood or environement ''sinister'' or dark is also really counter intuitive to solving a puzzle, which requires both focus and concentration. The constant lights, loud sounds with no grounds other than being loud leave much to be desired.Another puzzle had the player pull a key from a pocket watch. The key was at least 3 times the size of the pocket watch and came from some ''portal'' when you put a red lens on, which is not explained, justified or reasoned in any way, shape or form.Lastly, I have to stress this...I paid a little over 2.00$ for this game on steam 80% off sale and I'm still wishing they had put more brain into the puzzle and make them realistic within real time game mechanics. Despite the sale, I still feel this was a huge let down and only take comfort in the that the graphics were really detailed and sharp. If only the rest of the game was the same."

This game is in some ways better than the first, but it has all the same weaknesses as the first. Either the game's puzzles are laughably easy, ending up being ""here is a thing now use the thing"" or it becomes a matter of sitting around looking about cluelessly because the game provides you no actual idea as to what you're supposed to do. It is, simply put, a 3D game of eye spy at that point, and there is very little 'puzzle' and a lot more looking about. This game, however, is slighty better than the first, in that it did contain a few puzzles, which were at least interesting, and it uses the themes of its rooms well.There is just one, majorly glaring flaw with this game over the first, and it's that it attempts to tell a story, and for what it is, it's a mighty confusing one at that. The only real 'puzzle' element is that this game makes no logical sense, by which I mean there seems to be a gulf of a disconnect between the puzzles and the supposed narraitive that we are trying to tell. For reasons never explained, we are solving puzzles in rooms while following someone else for... reasons. This is all caused by something called the 'null element' because reasons. The guy who was preceeding us somehow found the time to turn a ship at sea, a mayan temple, and a seance parlor into a puzzle filled room because... reasons? There's no clear reason why you're doing anything in this game. And then the ending gets all metaphysical, talking about souls and trading the guy who's leaving notes everywhere for some woman's, and then hers for yours, and then you come out of a room and an explosion and... that's it? I said of the first game that it made no sense, and it seems this game is essentially more of that, more nonsensical than anything else. I thought, perhaps, that they were going for a bit of a Lovecraft vibe, given the final chapter revolving around the reanimation of corpses, and the ship level mentioning a crazy man grasping onto something. But aside from that, there is no real story to tie everything together. You're just sort of walking from room to room, solving puzzles for seemingly no reason, which leaves the whole thing feeling rather empty.If the game wants to be a story-driven game with light puzzles, it fails because the story is incomprehensible. If it's meant to be a hard puzzle game with story elements, it fails because the puzzles are too simple. It tries to be both, and succeeds at neither as a result.Of course, if you're just looking for a quick two hour puzzle game in some interesting locals, it might be worth it for you. But for me, I expected a bit more than more of the same for a sequel."

There is little to no logic surrounding where the hidden drawer or compartment resides, you just look around and usually it's bleedingly obvious. When you run into an actual puzzle, it usually takes around 3 seconds to solve. The game's graphics are built around cool looking mechanisms, but this is rarely used to the puzzle's advantage. They are usually just for show. If you want to kill time by looking at cool mechanic animations, you can get this game. So far I haven't come across any actually challenging puzzles, so if that's what you're looking for then I don't recommend buying this game."

Where the original had interesting and clever puzzles this game had odd puzzles that held no logic and didn't fit together. A major part of the charm of the original, at least for me, was how many puzzles they could fit into such a small area, with this game they let you explore entire rooms (as the name suggests) with a lot more objects to interact with. However most of the interactions weren't very interesting and weren't even puzzles.One 'puzzle' in particular that stood out was in the second area and there was no for-seeable way to solve it other than brute forcing it. You had to choose the path for a boat and I couldn't find any other way to do it besides trial and error.If you want a good puzzle game check out the original Room, much better game in every aspect."

The first part was a little bit more magical and impressing, I do not like the atmosphere of this one. Maybe because I am not a native English speaker I could not catch the plot line. Spoiler:Where do these beasts, ghosts, woodoo, taro come from? I am not really a fan of solving puzzles with the help of black magic, burning dolls and inspecting the skelett :/ There is a lot if images that could be used instead.The graphics are very impressive, but all the light peaces like windows and lamps gave me an impression as if I was looking them at 640x480, though I put the graphics at maximum. Charing the battery in the last scene I got a bug meassage clicking on the place where the broken resistor was.Although I like the soundtrack, some new chords could have been better. When I hear the same soundtrack I expect to get the same game as in the Room 1. But this part is different, shorter and less impressive (for me of course). If I here a different soundtrack - I can expect the new one and will not compare it to the previous. That is the logic.To be honest, I expected more from the game. It is definitly worth of buying it, but for me it was two times as short as the Room 1, also less impressive and even boring sometimesEspecially when you run three times to type the word into the typewriter. Even though the machine is cool, it was boring..So, buy the game if you are a fan of Room 1 or have not played Room 1 yet. Hah. In every case you will find that one of the games is better, but they are both cool still."

I find this, in particular, to be a really bad choice by the Devs. In the first game, everything you need to do and know is in a single box full of different mechanisms, and it makes it easier to do stuff without seeking tips and help from other sources other than your own brain, since you're focused in the same place all the time, each chapter. In The Room 2, there are many things to focus and remember in a room, this kinda ovewhelms the player and forces him to focus more on memory than on puzzlesolving, plus the incountable clicks you make to drag the camera across different spots in the room each time you think you know something.With that being said, The Room Two is still an excellent game with mind blowing puzzles and excellent atmosphere, and cryptic story. The only thing that keeps it from being a better puzzle game than the 1st is the new ""many objects"" mechanic that adds many other things for the player to observe in the room. I can't wait for The Room 3, which, as far as I know, will be a prequel and a sequel to the story we've been seeing.

It is a series of puzzles where you need to figure out how to open or operate different boxes or apparatus, find inventory objects and use them.  The puzzles are challenging but not insurmountable.  There are a limited number of ""in-game"" hints where you should not have to resort to any walkthroughs.  Eventually it all leads to escaping from the room to find yourself in another room until you escape the ""house"" at the end.An interesting storyline but, IMHO, unnecessary to enjoy solving all the puzzles.It is relatively short (I played through in 7 hours) but well worth the low cost.  In time, I think it will be replayable because I am now inspired to go back and replay the first ""The Room.""  I read somewhere they are coming out with a 3rd one but I have not verified that.If you enjoy a good puzzle game, I highly recommend this game!"

Each puzzle in a room may be independent from one another, or one puzzle will activate another one in sequence upon finishing, but all puzzles come together to activate a doorway that allows you to progress to the next room!Being quite the fan of puzzle games and using the grey matter to solve these puzzles, I found myself rushing right through the entire game as everything is sort of “given” to you, of what to do. There wasn't much involvement for thinking or problem solving as the game loosely guides you through the puzzles, and found myself finishing this game in 2 hours. Compared to the 4-6 hours of The Room I did a review for previously.My overall score for this game, would be a 5 / 10.  It's got very nice graphics, a lovely style, a game with working mechanics, nothing glitches or breaks. Some puzzles may be hardy, but are quickly solved with little thought in it.If you want a casual puzzle game without racking your brains out in stress trying to solve impossible puzzles, this game is for you!I found myself enjoying it though regardless of it's shortfalls and easy difficulty, which is what matters, having fun with games! :)"

Since I loved the first one, loving the second was something I really wanted and it fortunately happened. Still, there are some things both developers and buyers should take under consideration. The Room Two is overpriced. Meaning money. Its price should be 2-3 euros comparatively to what it offers, although I always prefer more content than lower prices. Something important to remember, this game offers only a one time experience. Of course it is a puzzle game but it could surely be more challenging. Maybe now I know how to think since the previous game, but some more achievements would do only good. Secrets, for example, that only people who spend more time on it would be able to find, without affecting the main story. I didn't mind the new effects. I actually liked the darker atmosphere. About the notes, maybe they could make more sense, like in the first one. To sum up, pretty enjoyable game, nice visuals, smart puzzles, good story, slightly poor content, kinda easy after you get used to it. I believe a purchase during sales would offer more satisfaction.

The closest equivalent I can think of is the Myst series, but with better logic and no tedious backtracking.  (And no obnoixous NPCs that I wanted to murder instead of helping.)  The graphics are gorgeous and the controls are smooth.  While a few puzzles require you to position something, there's a fair amount of leeway allowed - no hunting for that one exact pixel.As with a lot of puzzle games, the game is light on plot, but that's not a bad thing in this case.  There is a story, but it's subtle and sprinkled through the game, leaving you with questions as well as answers at the end.  You're searching for a powerful artifact that can only be uncovered by solving intricate puzzles.  Amongst the puzzles are letters and journal entries from someone who came before you, searching for the very same item.  As you progress, the game becomes darker and creepier, adding an emotional atmosphere that's lacking in a lot of games.The game offer solutions for different puzzles, starting at hints and getting more detailed if you ask for more info.  You can't immediately click through the hints to the solutions, though.  You have to wait a bit after each hint before you can get the next one.  It makes sense - it allows a person to revisit the clue before getting the solution.I finished the game in 4 - 5 hours, which is more than fair given the price of the game.  I did need a few hints, mostly because I was getting a little tired at the end.  There was one puzzle that I probably could not have solved without a hint, but that wasn't the game's fault.  I misunderstood what I was seeing at one point and overlooked the obvious solution.  I can't think of a single puzzle in the game that didn't make sense once solved.I hope there will be more Rooms to explore in the future."

It passed all of my expectations and then some, pushing the bar even higher for the third installment of The Room collection. I CAN'T wait forThe Room 3to be available for purchase on Steam. The Room 2 was fully worth the full price.If you enjoy puzzle games that reqire you to think outside the box (even with the added bonus of a Hint option if wanted), then this is a MUST HAVE collection for your library. ^^ Thank you Devs and I'm looking forward to #3."

Good times and subtle Clthulhu vibes.While the puzzles were overall pleasing and the chapters had nice varying themes, I think that the way the player had to constantly switch between normal vision and red light vision in order to find clues was a bit tedious. It seemed like an artificial way to make the game last longer. But that's the only complaint I can think of."

Like in part one, puzzles are mostly about finding things and finding where you have to put them and depending mostly on visual clues. So, again, they aren't puzzles that need much brain power to solve.The execution is great though. Again amazing graphics and animations. The rooms are thematic and have a great mystery vibe to them.Personally, I liked this part more than the previous. And that was mostly because of the much darker spooky atmosphere. I also like that there is more interaction between different objects in the same room.So, again, I think the puzzles should have been much more mind boggling instead of pixel-hunting.But while The Room (part one) just didn't deliver enough to warrant a positive rating for me, this one surely did."

The original took place around one puzzle per level, while The Room Two has a larger room with a few small sections to each one. I prefered the style of the first game, but this one plays quite well. If you want to follow the story definitely play through the first one, but the game is certainly playable without background knowledge.The graphical improvements over the mobile versions are quite beautiful. The shadows are done well, and are used quite nicely in-game to draw or detract focus to/from various areas. For a game built in the Unity engine it is fantastic looking.The game does rely heavily on observation; if something looks different from others, it's likely important. This was probably my biggest gripe with the game, was that in some cases it wasn't very intuitive as to what to do next. Most of the time you have an idea of what you need to open, but you don't have the requried item at the moment. The hint system is there for these situations, but any time I used it I felt the resulting piece I needed to find etc wasn't particularly well placed. In particular there is a jar at one point with a particular importance to it, while it only looks slightly different from the others... While I feel this is an area the game could improve, I did still quite enjoy the time I spent playing it.Overall this game is an enjoyable puzzler with good graphics and gameplay, and quite a good price point. This is easily one of the only games on Steam that I paid full price for. I eagerly await the arrival of The Room Three, although as it was just recently released on mobile it will likely be a while."

In order to not repeat the review linked above, I'll say that the puzzles in this game are of the same quality (which is a good thing), whilst offering more challenges! Each chapter now has different objects and area's for the player to interact with, a feature which greatly improves transitioning from one step to the next.The atmosphere, graphics, music and gameplay mechanics are fantastic in the PC version, and I have to commend the developers for their use of cutscenes and subsequent decor transformations, they make the game really immersive!The storyline continues straight from where it left off, and the lore takes an interesting direction, adding further to the mysteries at hand.Overall, I'd say this game is a definite buy if you liked the first game!"

Dev's asked for a comment so here you'll get. A possible buyer might skip most parts, as they're long and boring ;)result:A very nice game. Some flaws in gameplay, which are settled by atmosphere. When on sale you shouldn't consider twice! Buying at fullprice wouldn't probably be your worst mistake in life.Contra:-Greatest flaw in my opinion is the control. I played with pc-mouse.I got stuck in a few hotspot notivications, because I used right klick out of reflex to quit, countless times I steped back to a previous perspektive because of reflexive use of right klick, and so on. I like the mechanic to manually switch every lever, crank, etc. BUT: circular movements are very painfull. Worst moment was the safe at the seance. I'd loved to see a ""use right-klick for look around"" button in the options menu would be worth 1 to 2 stars ;)-Difficulty:At the beginning the puzzles are possible a bit too easy. But that would be fine. Later on the puzzles mostly don't get much harder, but more abstract. Way too often I felt tempted just to click and see what might happen, than to think of a next step. Too many solutions were hidden hotspots without a clue leading towards it. Maybe just 2-3 times I actually thought ""OK, I knew about this lock, mechanic, key, but I forgott."" The question if and where to change the tables left  mostly unanswered.Pro:- Grafics:It's not a Bottlefield 1, but looks perfectly nice for a puzzle-adventure. I saw what I had to see (buttons, switches, etc.) I didn't saw what I shouldn't (secrects, bugs, too much pixels). I got pretty fast deep in the atmosphere of the game. Maybe a bit adjusting of the flashing symbol would be nice. The first time it was quite perfekt, but I was either missing a link to my looking around, nor was it shown long enough to actually tell my what I was searching for. But it flashed often enough to interrupt my search a bit.-Puzzles:Maybe I'm totaly wrong, but the fact that I'm thinking about it now, tells me to add this point on my list. Even if you have to do some same puzzles (like rotating your view to get 3d lines to a picture), there is a good variation. I never felt like repeating the same puzzle over and over again, and when I got an equal feeling it was more like ""Oh, I know the way to fix this, but I have to adapt"" or there was a chain of events which justifices a repeating puzzle (like the mirrors in the lab).- Atmosphere:Nice and dense. Everything done right from my point of view.I felt close to playing a shortstory of H.P. Lovecraft. Lot's of parallels of charakter-knowlege, story / background advises, locations, presentation of the monster and overall mystic worldview.Constant reminder:""Yog-Sothoth knows the gate.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.The Room 2 follows the style of the first one very closely while adding new elements and a much more exploratory puzzle system. Each room leads to the next, giving a sense of an adventure! With every room I finished, I was excited to keep going and to finish the next, and the next, and the next...One thing that I found surprising was the more complex story that was able to string a seemingly unrelated group of locations and situations together. Sure, sometimes you had to piece details together for yourself by observing several scraps of papers, notes of medical experiments, letters and notes to various people, and so on, but it left you to decide whether this game will leave you an experience in puzzles or an experience in story-telling AND puzzles.The puzzles also had a few fresh twists. In the first, most puzzles could be completely solved with various parts and mechanisms of the box, and very rarely involved things around the room. The Room 2 widens the spectrum and does just that. Instead of focusing on a singular box, each puzzle may involve multiple puzzle boxes to lead to the penultimate door to the next room. It made for a more complex and time consuming experience, as you constantly zoom in and out of different points of view to solve one portion of a box, get a key, go to another box, open it, solve a puzzle, which then gives you a tool to solve the next box, etc.Overall great game 9/10 can't wait for The Room 3 for PC"

That was a pleasant surprise as while I loved opening catches and manipulating secret compartments on boxes in order to reveal their hidden secrets, the very final block shifting and moving a ball around a maze puzzles of the first game worried me a little in that they felt more like standard puzzles than those that came beforehand. They were not particularly bad, just placed that nagging feeling that the game designers were starting to run dry of novel puzzles at that extremely late stage of the game. So I would not have been too upset if the sequel had continued that trend, but ended up very pleasantly surprised!It was also nice to find out that the sequel is a direct continuation from the first game as after opening the portal to another dimension Hellraiser-style, we play as the same character exploring strange realms by following in his master's footsteps. Even more than the first game this literalises the spooky and Lovecraftian aspects to all of the box openings (it feels as if this game knows it is working in a darker register than the more enchanted with scientific wonder first game had. Which is appropriate for the second game involving someone now trapped inside a different dimension!) , as now instead of one box opening to reveal another smaller one Russian-dolled inside it, or a single table revealing hidden secrets (which the first game still does the best) the second game has a single room contain multiple different areas that all inter-relate to each other. The backgrounds open up to reveal new elements (particularly in the Egyptian tomb level), or new boxes or treasure chests magically appear once a particular piece of the puzzle is unlocked (the pirate galleon level). There's a great ghost photography automatic typewriting, writing desk with secret compartments, tarot card seance level. And then the final level is a kind of archetypal mad scientist's lab that contains the most elaborate set of workstations and puzzles of them all (including a very Jan Svankmayer-esque segue into collecting various types of insects to replace on a pinboard!), and an amusing ending that literalises the Lovecraftian aspects!Perhaps the aspect I most liked about The Room Two is that all of the puzzles still felt naturally arising and flowing from one into the other. Both the first game and this one have a wonderful, almost tactile sense of flicking switches, opening cupboards and exploring the wooden surfaces of various pieces of equipment in seach of a hidden catch or rotatable element that will lead onto the next puzzle (yes, there is a moment when you pull a particular book on a bookshelf to open a secret compartment!). And there is never a moment in this second game where I worried that the game designers had run out of ideas that felt as if they were arising from the evocative environments and then had to throw in a standard-issue puzzle instead. There is one extremely short level trying to pulley a boat to shore whilst surrounded by an aquatic tentacle creature that is more of an evocative location approaching the final laboratory level than anything particularly taxing, but I'd rather they did that than trying to pad the level out with shoehorned in puzzles! (And on checking the playtime on Steam, I played for about three and a half hours, the exact time that it took to play the first game, so the sequel does not seem to be cutting corners either)I think the best compliment I could give this series is that, although I keep going back to The Witness to complete a puzzle or two, I think these games are more evocative, mysterious and entertaining! Now I just have to wait for The Room Three to get ported across from mobile, which should be around 2018! (Apparently the length of time it takes for these games to reach PC is due to the way that they are getting completely re-made for the platform, rather than just being the original mobile game version transferred across)"

Really interesting puzzles woven into an intriguing narrative.Using only the mouse, you will explore a room at a time, solving the various puzzle boxes which are (in this version) part of the furnishings. I found it really satisfying to discover all the little intricate locks and compartments hidden within the rooms design.I bought this one (Room 2) in a sale for about £1.99 BARGAIN. I was worried that the developer may have just rushed out a sequal whilst people were eager to continue the story but I was completely wrong. The puzzles are tricky enough to leave you stumped from time to time but with the exception of some hard to spot mechanisms you should have an enjoyable but not too easy challenge. There are hint's but I expect most people will manage to use this sparringly as the puzzles aren't too convoluted.

Several times I've been left having no idea what to do next since there's so many things to see and do, but I can't find it in the large area that I have to explore. That does in the end turn out to not be much of a problem, as it only makes everything more satisfying when I do manage to find out what to do next. One of the few games I've even considered reviewing, and it totally deserves it."

I know it's a mobile port but really, less than 2 hours?I love puzzle games and I was loving both of these games up until I finished them and realised that it just didn't feel like a full game to me.Furthermore, it feels like the puzzles got wider in the sequel, but also more shallow. Completing a puzzle didn't feel anywhere near as rewarding as the original, it just felt like you went to each item and brute forced all the clicks until something, well... clicked. The original had much deeper challenges, locked up in just one box sometimes getting deeper and deeper, but this time the puzzles were spread out over 3 or even 4 tables and mechanisms.In summary, it really is a great game. It's well-made, the story's great, the graphics are superb for it being a mobile port but it just doesn't feel complete and it's too short. Sure, it's cheap, but I expected at least another hour from both the original and this addition and that's the only reason I wouldn't recommend it - if you just want a couple hours of pleasant, but fairly complex, puzzles I would recommend it however if you want a complete game I would not recommend The Room or The Room Two.I still can't decide whether to vote this game up or down, yet.Note: I may have just gotten lucky / grasped the puzzles quicker than others - I do NOT know what the average playtime for these games are, but as you can see by my achievements, I completed this game in under 2 hours."

,Recommended,425580,24151782,"Posted: 7 July, 2016",all,Lil Scrafty Vert,"Before saying anything else, I'll highly recommend that you also purchase and play through the first game, The Room. I bought it at a measly $1.32 during the summer sale, but I would pay full price for both games.The Room Two offers slightly more challenge than its predecessor. I personally didn't find the puzzles in either game extremely difficult, although there were maybe one or two occasions in The Room Two where I had to use a hint to move forward (I might have found the solution eventually after lots of clicking, but still). The puzzles are challenging enough to hold your interest and, when combined with the fantastic controls and feel of operating the puzzles, feel rewarding to solve. The chapters also feel longer than in the first game. I reckon it only took around an hour for me to beat the first game, and The Room Two took around two hours to beat. Each chapter in The Room Two, including the tutorial, is centered around an entire room containing multiple objects and pieces of furniture that you have to switch between to eventually find the glyph that opens the door to the next chapter. In this sense, The Room Two does nothing but improve on the last game. If you weren't a huge fan of using the eyepiece so much in the first game, you'll be happy to find that they've reduced the amount you need to use it in The Room Two.The storyline delivery is unchanged from the first game; appearing in notes scattered around each chapter, the story is ""there"" enough to feel like the game has a story that you're following, but is never shoved in your face and never holds you back from progressing through the game at a steady pace. While I wouldn't say the storyline or delivery is necessarily improved significantly from the first game, it is definitely done as well, and is done in a way that I love for this type of game.The atmosphere changes slightly from what I felt to be more of an alchemic mystery from the first game into more of an eldritch horror atmosphere in The Room Two. It definitely captures some level of horrific/creepy/unsettling atmosphere above what the previous game did. This isn't to say that one has a better atmosphere than the other at all; they're simply slightly different. Both games achieve the same quality on establishing their atmosphere.The Room games are cheap, quick puzzle games that cram an Eldritch story of Alchemy's darkest pursuits into a short burst while still pulling off the story and atmosphere better than most video games I've played. The Room Two improves on the puzzle aspect of the games in every way from the first game. I can't recommend these games highly enough."

It's still a great game and it has all the things that made the first Room shine: wonderful, haunting, mysterious Lovecraft-esque atmosphere, great graphics, and interesting puzzles, of course. However, its puzzles feel less engaging: now you need to interact with different objects in the room instead of just focusing on a puzzle box in front of you. There's nothing wrong with this, but because of it the boxes in the Room Two  are much simpler and don't give you this sense of wonder as you are unwrapping them, like in the first Room. That's my biggest complaint, but other than that it's pretty much like the Room, so if you liked the first, you should definitely play the second.Worth the full price."

I was quite suprised by it's atmospheric presentation and it's cleverly presented puzzles. The puzzles especially were polished to a degree where they feel quite challenging, but not overly cryptic or difficult. I believe most common folk could figure them out even if they didn't used the hints that are given to them if it takes longer for them to figure said puzzle out.Now Fireproof Games comes with it's sequel ''The Room Two'' and it is definitely a step up in terms of graphical design. Environments look much more detailed and the sound design is chilling at best. There is a bit of a horror theme going on but it's more disturbing rather than it is scary, really. The new puzzles do have a small similarity to the first game in terms of structure and progression but ultimately feel new and fresh on the way of how you solve it.It takes roughly 1,5-2 hours to complete but for the price of admission, that is a wonderful little bargain.

Sometimes the controls are very finicky. the red dials in the last level especially took me round-about 3 minutes just to get the knobs to the right slots,2. then the table was useless without showing indication that it was. A rolling issue that seemed present in all the levels. Maybe it's something that there isn't really a work around for, but everything I looked at even once it's purpose was served, seemed to still have more to do on. An excellent example of that was the triangles on the ship. Couldn't find one of them, and even though highlighted with the eyepiece, didn't do anything.3. A few of the moving puzzle pieces glitched. Of note, the coin sliders that opened the weights I never even slotted out properly and it parted out as solved. some other puzzle pieces I couldn't even find, so I just guessed at the sigils such as the mirror, to switch to the gold temple, and was only able to find the way to switch it back after getting more pieces from each temple and switching back and forth several times anywaysIf these are just my being stupid, no problem, but you asked for feedback and it's what I have to give"

I will say that while the storyline is much creepier than that of The Room 1, it raises more questions than it answers and leaves the player wanting to know more at the end. I think The Room 1's strength was its focused gameplay; The Room 2 is a little more disjointed and some of the puzzles seem to be a bit forced. At one point you have to charge several batteries, and the charging mechanism's fuse blows, forcing you to search for another one. You don't unlock anything new in the course of doing so; it seems to exist merely to create more busywork for the player--""go here and do a thing, now come back and do the thing you were trying to do in the first place."" I want to solve puzzles, not change lightbulbs.That gripe aside, it's a very fun game and immersive in its own way. While it's not as intensely gripping as the first Room installment, it retains the charm of the original in quite a few ways. I would say if you liked the first Room and you're not adverse to parting with the cost of a large latte, go ahead and buy this game."

The developers' extensive attention to detail makes every puzzle a treat, even on the lowest settings. The artwork and the music add an air of suspense, and  I half expected it to turn into a horror game half-way through. Although this game could be played seperatly, it does continue the story started in The Room, so for the full experience, I suggest you play that first.As with the first game, this game is rather short, one could finish playing it in roughly 3 hours, depending on your puzzle-solving skills. Hints are included, but can be disabled from the options menu for an extra challenge. For the price it is currently selling at, I strongly suggest you buy both The Room and The Room Two. Even at full price, I would personally say this game is still a good deal, although the decision is up to you whether you think 3-ish hours of puzzle is worth it."

76561198039864078,Recommended,425580,33012069,Posted: 29 June,all,Bata Sale,"Great little indie adventure game. Puzzles are all logical and make sense which is a major plus.Way too many games of this type fail on two things. The first one would be puzzles that make no connection in terms of logic between the problem and the solution. Often adventure games face us with puzzles that are hard to break just because the solution is quite irrational and the player can never make a connection to the solution which leads to frantic using of everything in the inventory just to check if it works. The second would be pixel hunting, clicking everywhere to check if there is an object or a hotspot, often paired with very tiny area that allows player action.This game avoids these two problems completely. Everything is visible and obvious if you use your observation skills and logic properly. A beautiful little game that every hardcore adventure gamer should try.The only downside I have found is that this is a very short game. But having in mind that the game was created by a very small indie team this should not be held against it.In short, beatiful little adventure. Buy it, play it, support the indie teams like this one."

While not quite as engaging as The Room, the level of story telling and puzzle creation were the same. One of my favorite aspects about The Room was how each puzzle you solved added on to another directly connected puzzle. They were all delicately and beautifully contained within one box, one table, or one object. This game had less of that artistry aspect and more of an intrigue aspect. While not a bad thing, it did not have the same feel as The Room.The Room 2 has a very atmospheric interface, forcing you to look at the entire room as opposed to one section of the room. I found this a bit troublesome towards the end as the levels added more and more separate and disparate pieces. Navigation was also very wearisome. There were points when I wanted to turn a knob or key but ended up turning my camera or pulling away from the item (without even right clicking), then having to find the knob again.Despite the navigation though, this game has very intriguing puzzles and boasts some very interesting settings. There is also a bit of a suspense element added through the music and graphics that can aid in immersion. Rating it in comparison to The Room, I would give it 3.5 stars. But rating it as its own game, I think it's worthy of 4 or 5 stars.Pros:* Interesting Story* Varied and clever setting* A good length for what it offeredCons:* Wearying navigation* Less connected puzzle-solving, often disparate and hard to connectDefinitely worth the $4-5 you pay for it."

It is atmospheric with hints of suspense and horror.How difficult are the puzzles? Are they well balanced?The difficulty scales well - the rooms become gradually more difficult as you progress (but not overly). There is anoptionalbuilt in help system. This is a nice quality of life feature that allows you to bypass scouring the internet for a single solution. Of course you can simply turn off the hints as well if you prefer more of a challenge.What types of ""puzzles"" are used in the game?Most puzzles in the game can be broken down into 5 types:- The most common is simply switching/activating a mechanism to trigger an event.- Another type of puzzle is simplying picking up an item and placing it where it goes, such as keys or discs.- Using the ""Lens."" The Lens is an item that you always have with you that will occasionally be useful. It is generally used to see ""objects"" you otherwise would never be aware of.- Some items are interactable and you will need to use some ""finesse"" with the item before it works properly.- Far less common are true ""puzzles"" - things like sliding pieces into place, or solving a riddle.How long does it take to complete The Room Two?There are a total of 5 rooms to complete. Each room takes about 30-45 minutes to complete depending on the player. In total, it will take the average person about 2 hours (very fast) to 4 hours to complete.In terms of dollar value, is the Room Two worth the asking price?The game has a base price of $5.00, and can frequently be found on sale at half off for $2.50. Considering the quality of this game, I can safely say that even at $5.00 this game is more than worth the value. If you pick this up on sale, well then that's what we call better than a deal - that's a steal."

I had trouble in a puzzle or two since I couldn't adjust the camera to look certain directions. Possibly this is locked until you progress, then the new angle becomes available, but I really, really hope not.cons: puzzle items rarely have you spend much time in one location adjusting the same space. also, less use of the lens or perhaps just less good use of it. would have preferred more.All in all, good game.

When I saw it on steam it was an insta-buy and it has not disappointed. I am also glad I did not cave and purchase it on mobile.The Room games are excellent ""tactile"" puzzle games where you interact with objects to discover their secret. Moving swtiches opens up hidden compartments which provide objects which can repair other parts of objects and so forth. The only other tool is a spy glass which may reveal hidden text as clues or activate other puzzles.The ingenuity of the puzzles is supreme with varying puzzles and mechanics which all have logical solutions. If one just stops to think and not rush the game everything flows with little frustration. No abstract weird puzzles here, and with the simplistic ""touch"" interaction using the mouse to simulate hand movements it all feels very natural. The only trquirement is carefully examinming objects for clues and moveable parts. It's an absorbing experience and one feels as if one is trully interacting with objects created by master ancient craftsmen who wanted to hide great secrets for those patient enough to explore the object.Despite the games being short, the Room games are great value given the extreme involvement you have, the ingenuity of the puzzles and the environments they are in. Whilst there is no major story, this is in fact a positive aspect as the puzzles dominate the input of creativity from the developers.Overall:1. Great detailed textures and design of objects along with great lighting make for an immerisive experience.2. Excellent well engineered puzzles which will not frustrate but will still challenge you enough to make you feel accomplished. You won't be annoyed by abstract combinations or solutions.3. I can honestly say I often reminisced about my playthgrough of room one given the feelings of wonder and amazement. Room two will only add to that!4. The only con is sometimes the controls with mouse are not as intuitive as with touch but it certainly works and does NOT however hamper the game."

,Recommended,425580,33551423,Posted: 14 July,all,Porkins,"I enjoyed this experience.  This is ultimately a puzzle game in which you interact with various objects using your mouse.  A lot of the ""puzzle"" often derives to noticing a switch in a certain spot or identifying that two shapes go together.  Further, somtimes the puzzles felt more like a step by step errand more than a quandary (as in, the next step wasn't much of a mystery).  All that said, this critique is meant as a constructive criticism, because overall, this game was quite enjoyable.The tone is ominous and supernatural.  I don't think the game is meant to be scary, but there were times my imagination ran  a little wild, and I was left cautiously wondering what would be thrown at me next.  With the puzzle gameplay and the atmosphere, I was reminded quite a bit of Amnesia: The Dark Descent.  So, if you liked the puzzle aspect of Amnesia, but didn't like your heart leaping out of your chest and your pants needing to be cleaned, you will probably like this.Ultimately, my main complaint is the game felt quite short, and a touch unfilfilling by the end.  However, I did put a solid and enjoyable 4 hours into it, and the game sells for $5.  I got the game on sale, but even at $5, it's hard to argue this isn't worth $1.25 per hour of entertainment.  You defeinitly get bang for your $1.25.If this was longer, I would say this is a B+, possibly an A-.  As is, I'd go with a B.  I am looking forward to the Room 3."

The game gives you hints if you seem to be stuck, but this is optional and can be turned off in the settings, which is a plus.  Overall this game was super fun and I could not stop playing!!! I would be so happy if they made another game like this one!!"

The perfect immersive experience is achieved with the use of excellent graphics along with minimal but effective audio plus the same familiar gameplay that will not disappoint any fan of the first one.Like its predecessor, the puzzles are intricate without being illogical and convoluted, and has just the right amount of challenge without being frustrating.  The overall design is just brilliant, and no other games in the genre even comes close.Play both games in the series for the immersive atmosphere, improve your skills of observation, and get a nice little brain workout too while you're at it.

Very interesting, atmospheric, story driven, complex, with just enough creepy factor to make it fun. My only complaint is that some of the puzzles were either impossible to find or very counterintuitive. I would not have finished the game without the hint system. Using the hints, though, felt kind of cheaty and disappointing. The puzzles were delightfully complex, but I just wish they were easier to find so that you wouldn't spend an hour searching for the next piece only to give in to the hints and find there was a tiny switch hidden somewhere you never would have looked."

The best way I can describe the feel is if H. P. Lovecraft came up with the idea for Pinhead's puzzle box. Tinkering with and unlocking the mechanisms in this series is endlessly satisfying, even though most of the interactions themselves are relatively simple. Each object feels crafted rather than rendered, and every action is accompanied by a perfect click or whirr. At this point, sitting down with a new release of one of these games is an event for me. If you enjoy puzzles, odds are it will become one for you, too.It took me ~5 hours to complete, and I used a few hints on the last chapter.Many thanks to Fireproof Games for bringing The Room Two to Steam!

,Recommended,425580,30208921,Posted: 26 February,all,Anyaira,"As its predecessor, The Room Two is visually stunning, with entertaining puzzles, and an optional story.I definitely recomend this game, however, please be aware that this is not a game for people who like puzzles that require thinking, everything in the game is absolutely lineal and is more of a mouse clicker and dragger than an actual puzzle game. This also makes the game incredibly short, it has a single ending and there are no optional paths, and as the puzzles are not procedural or random, replayability is nonexistent.The BGM is a perfect fit for the game, it blends so well you won't notice it, but it keeps you in the mood to keep going.As for the story, I can't say it's very interesting, and it requires the player to read pieces of paper with barely any text spread around the levels; it's also pretty vague, implying more will be explained in future sequels.FInally, the price isn't that high, but it only takes about 2 hours or less to clear, and since it's a one-time experience, that makes the price a bit high for what it provides.Summing up, it's a game for a single afternoon in which you don't want to think much but want to see pretty things in a nice and well done atmosphere."

There are no warnings about this, and it happens towards the end of most chapters.  I found itveryannoying.The Room Two is rather creepy and unsettling in comparison to the first episode, particularly the ""seance"" chapter.  Note that if you have an aversion to such things as Tarot, you may want to give this game a miss.  However, given the somewhat supernatural nature of both these games, if you enjoyed the first one you probably won't mind this.In some ways The Room Two was harder than the first game, in that there are sometimes several things you can look at and try to interact with so it can be difficult to know where to start (the final chapter was probably the worst example of this).  Hints are available if you get stuck, though, and the game does a fairly good job of leading you around the different rooms.  In other ways, though, I felt that it was easier than the first game - especially in the way it often makes it SO obvious where you should use the eyepiece!I did like this game and I recommend it, but personally I think I enjoyed the first game more.  I loved the ""tactile"" feel of playing with the boxes in that one, and although this episode has more varied locations I missed that tactile feeling.  My favourite location here was the ship, because that evoked some of the same feelings as the first episode.If you like puzzle games then get one or both of these.  Don't be put off by the ""horror"" tags - horror isn't my thing at all but I didn't mind the atmosphere in these games, and as mentioned above I'd describe it as creepy and/or unsettling in places rather than horrifying."

There is the option to play with clues on, in case you get stuck.The art style is amazing - imagine 1800s Victorian style furnishings blended with mystical science and a dash of mad science. Great sound design as well; subtle, yet immersive.Best $3 ever spent."

Chapters 1 and 3 (the model ship and the seance table) are fun and make the game worth playing.

Unlike the first room game where it was just a puzzle box inside a puzzle box inside a puzzle box, the room two's puzzles use more of the room they are in. It has very creative, interesting and difficult puzzles.The hint system is great as when you are feeling frustrated with a puzzle it gives you an optional hint. My only gripe with this is that sometimes it gives the hint too fast. If you are reading a letter for example, It might take you some time to read it. It is a little frustrating when the game thinks you need help when in reality you were just trying to read a letter.Other than that this game is definetely worth a play. I would wait for a Sale though as it only took me about 2-2.5 hours to complete."

It's kind of like the Eye of Sauron flashing at you, and it's incredibly annoying because you're forced to stare at the screen in order to solve a puzzle.

If you are expecting challenging puzzles where you have to think, calculate, and collect information for later like you would with the Myst / Riven / Uru series, you will be sadly disappointed.  The rooms barely got progressively harder, because short of collecting a few inventory items, most of those items can be used in only one place.

Beautiful graphics with puzzles that are challenging enough to make you want more without being overwhelmingly complex.

It kind of reminds me of Myst (in a good way), although the gameplay is about only hovering around specific objects and turning locks, pushing buttons etc. But man, it's GOOD.Devs, please, hear my plea: Make this into something like realMyst, with a world to explore, with multiple similar puzzles.Or alternatively, make more Room games.

I throughly enjoyed The Room 1 and this game continues that legacy very well. My only gripe is that, probably 5 or 6 times, I'd hit a deadend and when I checked a hint it would tell me to do something I'd tried earlier that didn't work, but suddenly did. It's like if you don't click the exact right spot and move the mouse the exact right way on certain things, it just doesn't work. That was annoying, but no enough for me to leave a negative review"

I decided to get The Room and The Room Two during a sale cause I didn't know much about them other than they were escape games. They were great. I finished each of them in about 4-5 hours of active game play.Both were pretty complex but doable without having to use a walkthrough. I figured out almost everything without using the hints . There were a couple times the hints were required to point me in the right direction. I was impressed with qualitity of the hints in both games, very clear and enough to solve the next step without giving away the whole thing.The graphics were really smooth and had some beautiful scenes and displays. I played it on a desktop from 2009 and it looked the same as the videos on the steam page. One a little more that two would have a slight delay when starting up an animation but once started the whole animation completed smoothly.Both had interesting stories, number two had some macabre elements so FYI.The music was well suited to the story and each of the stages.I hope they make a third."

Being one of those people who learned to solve puzzles quickly, I often had a few difficulties with puzzles. Game contents and price relation are very good. 10/10ATMOSPHERE: It is eerie, spooky and dark in every room. Graphics are very good and surroundings are detailed. 10/10GAMEPLAY: As said before, difficult, yet solvable and fun puzzles. Broadens thinking outside the box and always takes into account the whole room as opposed to simply a station within the room. Memorizing and putting things together is a requirement for this game. Hints are very helpful, but not too revealing, so if but a keyword is needed to continue, the hints do just that without spoiling every other step, though pressing the hint every time it lights up gives more information for the current step. 8.5/10 (see: CONS)CONTROLS: zooming in is double clicking, zooming out is right-clicking. You look around by clicking and dragging, same goes for opening closets or turning keys. 10/10 easy to understandCONS: Though gameplay is very good, I completed the whole game in 3.8 hours. Would personally enjoy more rooms, if in the form of an update or DLC. Would pay for DLC.OVERALL: I give this game 9.5/10 and recommend it to anyone looking for a short, but fun game to play."

76561197999045915,Recommended,425580,33202146,Posted: 3 July,all,DaSkruff,"Not as good as its predecessor, but still not a bad little game. Runs much smoother than the first room, and travels to more diverse locations. That being said the puzzles have been dumbed down substantially, so instead of having a rewarding experience of deducing things yourself, it's more of a ""can you follow simple orders"" simulator. Find the keyhole shape that matches the key in your inventory, put the circular piece into the circular hole. The simplicity of it all does make it much faster paced, for about the same length game (2-3 hours).The hint system is obnoxiously fast in this one- you'll be dropped into an area with multiple things to check out, and before you're even done with the first one, the hint indicator will be binging on screen, before you've even assesed what is a puzzle. It's a minor complaint, but an annoying one, especially when the first game got it right.Overall, I've bet you've spent $5 on worse things. Hoping that the third game in the series is designed more like the first one, but with the clean presentation/optimization of the second."

This game was a great culimination of Linear gameplay without losing the feeling of the intrinsic puzzle platform. I liked that there wasn't too many things to do all a one time, the fact that you had to figure one thing out before moving on to the next made it seem easier and not rage inducing. The game captures that magical feeling of chinese puzzle boxes, although on a grander scale of course. The Devices and gadgets were rendered very lovely and made them feel ""authentic and worn"". If there was a complaint to be had it was the face that there weren't enough rooms to go through. After finisihing the game I was sad that I would not have any more to play. I am a Live streamer and it was a lot of fun doing one room on each of my streams, It seems like the perfect game for Some DLC packages if the oppurtunity arose. Thanks it was a lot of fun."

Eventually i finished game, and i slightly changed opinion, i am feeling neutral for this, but i dont want just to delete review.This puzzle game is the sequel to The Room and i think is a step down to the orginal game.Easier puzzles, smaller duration (althought they created more chapters), worst and more tiring controls and many porting problems. F.E. i needed to found a specific pixel to zoom/unzoom and eventually i was trapped in a lock.  ""Solved"" with restarting game.The idea to use the whole room for puzzles and item hiding was good and the only improvement to original game, but as said earlier, puzzles were not difficult.If you like a lot The Room, buy this only in sales.If you think The Room was average, don't buy.If you haven't played  The Room maybe buy only this (NOTE orginial game has visual bugs and CTD too)  and after ending, decide for 2."
,Recommended,425580,33711541,Posted: 21 July,all,Evilmanta,This definitely improved on the first Room. With multiple puzzles within room that required some cross-interaction it really kept you on the lookout. I really enjoyed this Room even more than the first one. The narrative that loosely held the different puzzle rooms together also was enjoyable.
,Recommended,425580,33741530,Posted: 23 July,all,Collo,"To preface this, I played The Room One as well and they kept a lot of the same problems as well as were able to fix some problems. Also this game is pretty cheap so many of the problems can be overlooked.CONS:However, there are many cons to this game. The most frustrating is the controls. Be it as simple as they are, small things like double clicking to zoom and right clicking to back out gets really annoying really fast. Since it is very difficult to tell what way to turn handles, what you can pick up, or where you CAN zoom in, you will just be clicking wildly on the screen until something works with something. That isnt a puzzle, thats just elongated gameplay. It leads to extreme frustration which for me just meant that i could only do a chapter per sitting without having to turn the game off.I love puzzle escape games, but what sets them apart is when the puzzles are fun since you can easily tell what you can use, and the real puzzle is what to do with what you are given. This game is just clicking and dragging until something fits in a really linear way. Thats not fun, thats work. For example you could be zoomed into a box and know that a key goes there so you drag the item from your inventory. But it doesn't work. The place was right, the shape was right, but you weren't zoomed in enough. your face has to be inches from the device to work. Or when you open a cabenet but the view is so zoomed in that the door wont open if you drag it across the screen, so you back up. But you cant touch the handle one step back. Nitpicking, but that is the entirety of the short game.PROS:The Room Two made many good improvements over the first game. Such as the room design no longer being just a box in a room, now its a whole room to 'explore' with themes and items besides boxes. The atmostphere is amped up many notches wich is something the game didn't need but highly benefits from. Cutscenes are better, lighting is better, graphics are better, length is better.The best improvement in my opion though is the atmosphere. This isnt a horror game by any means but i have had many instances of pulling away from the screen in fear as a noise echoes from the darkenss. Any time the lens is put on i expect to see spine shivering video footage as i did in only one occasion in The Room. This works really well with the creepy but calm ambiance that suddenly switches to something sinister. If you want a good scare i recomend playing this in the dark of night alone with headphones, though its definetly not Amnesia level scares.RATING:I'm not a professional critic so I'm not going to give it a number score, but i will say that I can recomend this game for the price. If its on sale, then I'd pick it up right away. It's rare to find good uneasy 'horror' games on steam for this much. If mindlessly clicking isn't really your thing, then don't waste your time."

I certainly did.The attention to detail is outstanding, as were the textures and lighting effects used throughout the game. Not surprising, perhaps, given that the available scenes (or chapters - seven in total) are limited to one room or setting each. But small can be beautiful; a point well made by the Fireproof team, who have succeeded in conveying The Room Two as the labour of love it most likely was.Most of the puzzles progress logically (to my mind at least) and often simply require you to find yet another hidden compartment in a piece of furniture. It can be quite satisfying when you do. Only on a rare few occasions did my enthusiasm fade enough to consult a well-structured hint menu that guided rather than pushed me to the next discovery.A quick mention of in-game sounds, which again are top-notch and help to build tension towards the end of each chapter. And of the sheer inventiveness on show here, that at times had me mutter ""wow!"" under my caffeinated breath - never a bad sign.For a fiver, The Room Two proved great value for money and left me with a warm enough feeling to write this. And I didn't even have to kill anyone. So if you're the puzzling type and enjoy a good-looking game that doesn't rush you, this may well be one for you."

Though out the whole game I only found one of the puzzles clever and entertaining, most other's were either fiddling with a piece because there was more to it than other, similar pieces (Talking about turning and twisting things because I didn't know what else to do with it.) Only for the game to later lock the item in place and never revisit the mechanic later. This isn't a bad thing by definition, but it makes it so that each room requires a different mindset, try to give a different experience each time but failing horribly. In the begging the puzzles feel like they're aimed for childeren under the age of 12, tasks such as spotting items in the dark becoming by far the most trouble found in the room. I played with my brightness at max and still had trouble seeing some things, only finding them by wildly clicking on the screen and getting lucky.TL;DR:If you're wondering if you should buy this because the first game was good, then don't. If you want to buy this because you're bored and wonder if it's worth the 5€, go for it. 5€ is rather cheap in my oppinion, granted it gave me about 4-5 hours of distraction I think it's worth it."

Fullscreen defaults to my second (smaller, lower contrast) monitor, so I had to play awkwardly windowed; resolution also doesn't go above 1600x900.For an indie game, the production values are through the roof.

You'll be finding parts of things like a model ship or a camera and assembling them to progress.The Room Two is more of the same from the first game, I would say the puzzles are moderately difficult; there is a hint system that can be toggled (I feel like it tries to clue you in too fast) but it's not often needed because there are hints in the environment as you progress.The visuals are good for a puzzle game and the audio is also nice but it would have been fun if it had surround sound (I have to say that, everything needs surround sound).Steam says I played for around 4 hours before finishing the game.

,Recommended,425580,35115498,Posted: 21 September,all,tcmotter,"The Room was a great success.  It had satisfying puzzles of just about perfect difficulty that were wrapped into a central construct of an ever changing box.  Basically a puzzle box toy on steroids.  However, a crucial factor was the atmosphere that the game created, especially in the second half.The Room Two takes these core elements and builds on them to make a sequel that outshines its predecessor in just about every way.  The puzzles have shifted from a box on a table to a series of rooms, and the puzzles now span several objects and areas in each room, making them more interesting and intricate.To me, the mood and atmosphere of the game are where it truly shines.  It's darker than the previous installment, much to my pleasure, and the expanded nature of the environment allows the developers the space to create vivid locations.  The fact that the puzzles are woven into the level design (rather than a thin pasted-on decor) makes it all the more involving.The game provides a rich experience, and hopefully we'll see its sequel in PC form.  Given what has been achieved here, I have high hopes for that one."

,Recommended,425580,35153372,Posted: 23 September,all,CitizenX3639,"Thanks to the developer and publisher Fireproof games for creating another great puzzle game for me to enjoy.The Room 2 is basically a continuation of the first amazing game. The difference in the sequel is instead of being locked in a room with changing puzzles, you will time travel to different rooms to solve a puzzle which unlocks a door to escape. The rooms are near photo realistic and the attention to the smallest detail is what makes the The Room series rare in the genre.There are 6 chapters in the Room 2 and each room can take up to an hour depending on your reluctance to use the hint system. Some of the rooms you will explore include a cave, labaoratory and a pirate ship. As you enter a room there are usually 3 areas that you will be tasked to solve. The Rooms signature gameplay of finding a hidden compartment to open another compartment, to find an object to solve the puzzles is front and center again. Veterns of the first game will find some of the tricks from the first a lot easier but a lot of them are still cleverly disguised. Luckily the hint system(optional) is perfect as it offers 3 hints to each problem while never exactlly telling you the answer. On most occasions when i did use a hint, the first was more than enough information needed to proceed.The Room series so far is never been about the the puzzles per se as they are pretty simple and straight forward but its about using your eyes, exploration and trying to find that hidden door, twist of a hinge, or looking under a drawer for the next piece to the puzzle that is satisfying. The attention to detail, amazing enviroments and complexity to these objects is why the series is unique, successful and one of the best.After completing the game i asked Fireproof games when the Room 3 was coming to Steam and their answer was ""We hope to bring it to PC in the future but no immediate plans"" :(PositivesPhoto realistic enviroments and puzzlesAttention to detailHint systemEvery puzzle was different and satisfying to completePerfect laptop/couch gameNegativesStory continues to be an afterthoughtWish you could freely walk aroundSometimes not knowing when an area in a room is complete"

So many times when something just didn't look out of the ordinary and it took some near accidental tinkering to actually hit them.My other gripe is the mouse controls can sometimes be REALLY wonky. Looking under the shelf in the last area took a full minute and a half of fighting with the controls. The little rune circle in the same area, while far more easy to deal with had a bad habit of suddenly moving your selection off because your mouse got too far away.Overall if the games continue this route I'll continue to buy but please put a little more into making sure that the controls are tight."

One such level has ONE puzzle and it's the easiest in the entire game...and it's in the latter half of the game. I'm not even joking.Whilst this was still a good way to take mind of things and immerse yourself into a logic-solving game, this game seems to stumble when pitted against ""The Room 1"" - the first game looked better, played better and had better puzzles, in my humble opinion.Finally, the controls are a problem. They're not...terrible, however they are clunky and it's easy for the game to misinterperate your intent.Overall - if you played and liked ""The Room 1"", then buy this game when on sale. If you didn't play Room 1, buy that and play it first. Simple ^_^"

It can definitely be challenging, especially if you do what I did and turn off the hints, but it makes solving the puzzles that much better."

Same strong atmosphere and unobtrusive storyline.I'd love to see if this series ever becomes free roaming, to have the freedom to just fiddle and explore these intricate devices/machines and if they ever add more interactivity to objects that aren't part of the puzzles.It's like taking part a TV remote to find out how it works."
,Not Recommended,425580,35437987,Posted: 3 October,all,wayneJK,"The Room One was really good. It was esoteric, but not pretentious. The story and the puzzles were cryptic but managable.The Room Two unfortuantely feels forced by comparison. The rooms you're trapped in are a little too grounded in reality -- it's not enough ""Chinese Box"" and instead is too much ""Batteries and beetles"" (see Chapter 6). Solving puzzles feels more like trial-and-error and pixel-hunting than thinking your way through a solution. By the time the final chapter rolled around I was so tired of the game's logic (or lack thereof) that I reverted to looking at walk-throughs on YouTube. Worth a sale price for the first few chapters, especially if you're a puzzle fan, but overall not nearly as rewarding as the first installment."
