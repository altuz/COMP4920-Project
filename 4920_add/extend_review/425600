If you like the older style of the Sierra/Lucas Arts Games you will feel right at home here with the hand painted backgrounds and great music. The Puzzles made sense and ranged in difficulty, none of them being punishingly hard. There also are not any dead end puzzles or deaths. So, if you enjoy a good adventure game that will take you back in time a couple decades to the ""Golden Years"" of the genre give The Order of the Thorne - The Kings Challenge a try. There is also a demo you can take for a test spin before purchasing the game. Thank you very much for the great game Infamous Quests team and I am looking forward to the next two games you have already announced and have in the works."

,Recommended,425600,20818396,"Posted: 28 January, 2016",all,Epicje,"This is one of those games that takes on 'King's Quest' or 'Quest for Glory' mostly in style, than in gameplay.There's only 2 buttons (interact and look) making it more of a point and click adventure.This is done very well though. The premise of the game is interesting, the plot is rather engaging, but really slow in its buildup. The atmosphere is nice, the music is decent and the quirk of the game is playing a lute.I personally thought it'd be more like Quest of Infamy and got rather disapointed at first. It's completely different from this game in nearly every aspect. There's no dry humour or well thought out slapstick humour... It's really more of an innocent point and click adventure, with some quirky moments.The story is about a bard that wants to do good in the world, while being on a quest to find the queen for a contest. It's simple enough at first, then the story slowly starts to unravel. Like in most point and clicks, there are small objectives to be done to achieve your goal. Aside from one instance, the items you need to progress are, in a way, obtainable through these side quest so it's pretty hard to get off the beaten track.However, for this one instance... It wasn't obvious. The item I needed was nearly 1 pixel, surrounded by a whole mass of pixels. Even with the walkthrough, I had trouble finding it. It also didn't help that the narrator said 'you don't need anything from here' while there clearly was something I needed from that section.The game is short though, which is pretty much of a let down. As per standard, it's going to be episodic and who knows when the next chapter will arrive.Despite that, I... Would recommend this game if people are into point and clicks that aren't too hard, but not too easy. I wouldn't recommend it for people that'd get a kick out of complicated games, or people that hate shorter games. I would also like to advice people that love the old King's Quest or Quest for Glory series... This is nothing like it.The asthetic is the same, but beyond that, it's a point and click adventure."

No text commands, but there is the lute interface which works well and is the ""unique selling point"" of the game, as it were. While the puzzles are easier than I've become accustomed to for this genre, they are not trivial by any means.The art and music are beautiful and the characters and environment are really well done. Considering everything is hand-drawn pixel art, the kingdom and forest are pretty extensive. The voice acting was a really nice addition and I also appreciated having the option to skip ahead if you've read faster than them.The game has a lot of unique touches and personality to it. While the adventure is fairly short and contained only to one setting, there is plenty of detail within which still gives the player a rich experience.There is humour in it too; I liked the running gag where you kept bumping into the two women trying to befriend the gnome who wasn't having any of it. Really amusing.My main gripe with the game is how ""bare bones"" it still felt with regards to the amount of interaction available other than that which was needed to continue the plot. This could just be that I'm used to having text commands available though, and they did the best they could with the two click system. There are also a couple of bugs (at the time of writing this) such as some conversation trees still being available when you'd already progressed past that part of the game. This was a little jarring although nothing game-breaking.On the other hand the forest and swamp are large enough that you have a lot of area to just walk around, explore and try things out. Did I mention it's really beautiful?Overall this was a very enjoyable game with lots of personality and a nice story, despite being quite short and small-world.It was extremely good value for the price paid (£6.99) and I will probably get the next episodes when they come out. Would recommend to fans of the genre."

My limited review here wouldn't do it justice, but it really was very well done.The play style functions intuitively for the novice and will be very familiar to fans of the genre. (Save save save!).The story was fun.  It was certainly characteristic of the genre, perhaps even a little canned, but I  truly didn't mind.  I would have preferred it it to be a bit longer though.Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, it is clear that the design team thoroughly tested the game, which I found to be completely free of any bug that would crash the game.  The team took the testing a step further and made sure that there were no logical dead-ends either.  I'm sure there's an official name for it, but basically where you advance to a point in the plot without obtaining something, and then can't proceed without reverting back to an earlier save/start. (KQ5 and the cat chasing the mouse still makes me grind my teeth.)I am thrilled that the point-and-click adventure game market seems to be picking back up after what seems like an eternity.  I really thought I'd seen the last of this sort of game until just a few years ago.  If you're a fan, there's a whole community of sites out there devoted to this type of game. Just like any other genre it is not without its fluff or repetition.This game isn't fluff, and I enjoyed it beginning to end.  If you're a fan of the genre you will like this game."

76561198099275658,Recommended,425600,29368257,Posted: 19 January,all,monkeymadness,"The Order of the Thorne - King's Challenge!This game is one that I've seen in recent years that has tried to stay true to the old classic Lucasart and Sierra games of the day. This is a good and a bad thing. I found the game to be pleasantly enjoyable in many reguards as I took a walk down memory lane and thought about some of the old games that I had played. The dilemma comes with the reasoning that since the game came out in 2016 it should look and feel much better than the classics as these games did not have the technology to produce the graphics we have today. So while I liked the game generally, here are some pros and cons of the game.Pros:The art of many of the backgrounds is good and the art for the portraits are amazing.The music is easily enjoyed.Finn is a great main character.There are some great easter eggs that pay tribute to the classics. I don't even think I caught them all.Cons:Game is a little short (3ish hours) and the storyline seems underdeveloped, since this is only the first what seems to be quite a few games (Intros are never that good, as the world and characters have to be setup).The animations (not the art) seem lacking and the scale sometimes felt off. Some examples being a boat that does not rotate to dock, but instead rows past the dock and diagonally back to it (if you can picture that) or the size of buildings next to Finn.I also didn't feel like a few characters did not line up with the fantasy world. These were the raptors and sloths. I understand that a game like KQ6 or KQ7 had a ton of weird characters, but the way the island/land seemed to seperate them allowed the game to feel more believable. This seemed more like a bunch of random characters.For me, this game may not be able to compete with Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's revenge (MY all time favorite point and click). But I still think the game is a good one and do recommend the game for anyone with a liking to point and click adventures, especially if you really enjoyed the old school games back in the day and all its pixel glory. I look forward to future games and understand that what they have been able to accomplish from where they have been is quite miraculous.P.S. The game runs at 320 x 200 and can scale up, but if you have a computer like mine you will be left with some black borders around the edge, which I don't mind but some people do."
,Recommended,425600,20883230,"Posted: 31 January, 2016",all,Destian,"(NOTE: spoilers contained within)First of all, I want to thank Steve for giving us the opportunity to stream an early version of OotT for our Extra Life charity event (which you can see here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U75-kYTgYzYremember, early version, not all of the voices were in, and some things have been moved around in the final version).Second, I'm the narrator and did a bit of playtesting on the game as well. Just want to put that out there so no one cries foul on me posting a review (I even bought a copy of the game, as I do for most games I record for).That being said, I think what I like most about IQ's games is that they look one way on the surface, but you start to see the depth behind the characters/story/concepts when you have some time to think about it later on.For example, some people complained that QFI treated women poorly, based upon some of the scantily clad female characters featured in the game. But once you actually interacted with them, it became clear that the game was mocking the archetype of the scantily clad female warrior and the games that had used it in the past. Voleris, the head of the Tyr's Arrows clad in a metal bikini, sounded entirely fed up with her lot in life. She rebuffed all of Roehm's advances, not in a ""playing hard to get"" manner, but in a way that suggested that she knew just how dumb it was that she was in the employ of a man that made her dress this way. She was sick of being an archetype.Flash forward to OotT and a few things pop to mind about the way I've seen people react, and since you know I liked the game already, I'll instead say a few things about some concerns I've seen raised...First of all, some folks have complained that the game is ""too happy"". Yes, the game is overall filled with characters who are content with their lot in life, but the first thing you see when you gain control of Finn are two pillars inscribed with the names of everyone who died in the last great war.In fact, when you talk to the king, he'll tell you that the primary reason for holding the challenge is because he knows that, even in peace time, it's important to give potential champions something to strive for, to keep them vigilant. This is a peace that was obviously paid for in blood. Later in the game, you'll visit a graveyard that also reflects just how true this is (and how backing one of IQ's kickstarters is a very dangerous undertaking, heh).So yes, the general tone of this game is one of peace and happiness, just like how the first Harry Potter had an overall light-hearted tone to it but things only got darker from there. We had to see Uir at peace to know just how much we have to lose (and the end of the game sets up some dark clouds on the horizon...).Second, I've seen some complain that Finn (the protagonist) is ""too sweet"".Right in the beginning of the game, we learn two important things about Finn: his father was a heroic bard of the Order of the Thorne who died in its service, and Finn seeks to do his father proud by following in his footsteps and becoming an amazing bard himself.We immediately know that Finn has taken some lumps from life already, but despite this, he's still a kind, compassionate artist who wants to make life better for others (and his wish reflects this most of all). However, we see a bit of cynicism poke through from time to time, like when he talks to the snobbish jerk of a priest, Abdon, and says something to the effect of ""A bard's job is to make life better for people, but I'm sure that's something YOU wouldn't understand"", or when Finn was sure that Skelton was going to kill him for trying to take his treasure, even while Snowy and Red (who are by far the MOST naive characters in the game) thought there was still good in Skelton. Finn certainly knew better.Finn is the person who has ""lost his innocence"", so to speak: he knows the world isn't all sunshine and rainbows, but he's not letting that drag him down to its level and turn him into an angry cynic (and I also have to add that Matt Curtis absolutely NAILED Finn's voice. Sometimes a voice just clicks with a character and that was definitely the case, here).So that's my take on the game and some of the concerns: some things that may seem simple on their face are in actuality a great deal more complex underneath, and I hope Finn's story arc (which clearly isn't finished) involves him accomplishing the goals he set out to achieve in TKC (and no, I don't know where his story goes from here)."

If you're familiar with the King's Quest series you'll even notice some direct allusions and homages.The graphics imitate that classic style and the music, voice acting and dialogue are all very good (lots of Scots voice actors).  I did turn off the narrator though, I couldn't handle someone slowly reading the description whenever I clicked on anything.In terms of weak points, the game is on the short side and the puzzles are pretty easy (I finished the game in 3.5 hours). Speaking of puzzles (most of which are inventory based), the designers did a good job of giving clues and letting you know when you were on the right track but hadn't quite gotten it right.One more inventive aspect of the game is that, playing as Finn the bard, you have a lute and can play a number of songs (you learn more as the game progresses--this part is a lot like Loom).  Playing the right song in the right situation is often necessry to progress.  But going back and experimenting, I noticed that trying out songs in different places can spark interesting interactions I missed the first time around and even help you perform one or two additional good deeds.  So there are a few secrets to uncover that lend the game a little replay value."

The voice acting is ok, aside from the narrator, but suffers from the same issues as Quest for Infamy, which is poor audio quality that really clashes with the quality of the graphical art which is outstanding. At least the lip smacking is gone but some of it sounds like it was recorded on a $10 microphone while other sound clips are crystal clear. All of that would be minor if the story were excellent.I hope the next installment is better, but the ending of the first one didn't leave me terribly excited for it."

It's very much like King's Quest. You wander around, pick up items, talk with people, gather info and clues, and figure out how to progress.So it's fun. But if you're a deft player, you can be done in 2 or 3 hours. Is that time fun? For the most part. But given the total content, once you're done, you're going to evaluate whether the money you spent was worth it.Even $10 is too much for 2 hours of fun and limited replay value. I got it for 6, and 6 I can handle.To the developers themselves, it's not a bad effort. But I'm hoping a future chapter will have more content. I think in total I dealt with about 10 characters and 20 items. You can do better still and really make it worth the price."
