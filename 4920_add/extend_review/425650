,Recommended,425650,26253019,"Posted: 27 October, 2016",all,DN Ministries,"Halloween Forever PC ReviewPreludeHalloween Foreveris a retro platformer with old-school style graphics of the Nintendo Entertainment Era; an awesome retro inspired soundtrack that can be compared to the earliestCastlevaniaandMega Mangames and precise controls that holster a great presentation with good graphics. InHalloween Foreveryou play as a character known as Pumpkin Man. Pumpkin Man is very limited in his mechanics within the control scheme. All he can do is kill enemies by launching or as the developer calls ' vomiting' candy corns until enemies vanish instantly after a certain number of hit points. There may be a story, but if there is, then I have not gotten that far in my progression of this game. There are many games out there currently in the personal computer gaming market that are now going this route. The route of re-inventing hardcore old-school platformers from the old days of the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Nintendo 64 era, Sega Genesis, Saturn, Dreamcast and the other most notable one of recreating, even some of the lovable aspects that made the Nintendo GameCube many years ago one of the best Nintendo selling systems because of its incredible array of surfeit titles and one main console exclusive,Mario Sunshinethat made it an ideal system for platformers. However, it can't compare to all the platformers that were released at the time of the Genesis and Nintendo Entertainment System's inception.Finally, gamers, reviewers, and developers, we have a game that combines the fine details ofCastlevaniaandMega Manwhile remaining distinct from these intellectual properties (IP’s).CastlevaniaandMega Maninterbred and out came their baby,Halloween Foreveror rather, Pumpkin Man. There are so many aspects to love inHalloween Foreverfrom the Halloween, a dark universe with enemies that represent death such as skeleton heads, a double-headed dragon boss, the Devil, small snakes, bats, and wizards. These are only a few of the whole cast of characters that have been added to the game, while more through the later levels will arise. Alright, is this game for me?Worth the Money?Yes,Halloween Foreveris worth its new price tag of $5.00. Cheaper than you can probably get into a haunted house this Halloween and later Halloweens, you get an old-school platformer that finally requires skill, patience, attention to detail, and quick reaction times. This game is separated from the majority of platformers we now have that are modern because it requires a good amount of strategy, however, most importantly, it could be counted as a side-scroller that is pattern based. Once you find the specific patterns of the bosses, the different moves that they execute, their positioning, whether they have two or three different forms, and how often these attacks occur, you will be able to defeat every single boss in the game.BossesThe bosses inHalloween Foreverare set up similarly toMega Man. You go through various levels destroying normal types of enemies while you can access secret areas, hidden items that I assume will help you later on the more challenging levels, and you can regain health which is randomized, by collecting hearts which add to your health meter.Mega Manwas one of the earliest games to my knowledge that came up with a specific concept, of course, they used bolts as currency and had upgrades you could buy through Dr. Wily's shop at the end of each level to prepare for other bosses. You would collect screws to be able to use at that shop. Through my experience so far (levels 1-3), I have not encountered any type of menu where you can buy upgrades nor is there any currency to collect. One of the bosses that I have encountered and beaten so far is a chainsaw man that is built like Jason Voorhees fromFriday the 13thand reminds me of the way in which he would also kill others. It is very easy to dodge his attacks; all you must remember is to wait until he throws out his chainsaw and start jumping.DifficultyStandardIf you successfully nail this, you can at least get one shot minimum at the first boss which removes one health bar out of his full health. If you are proficient at this game, you can even go with eliminating up to two health bars at a time. The others have different moves and get progressively harder, but are relatively simple to figure out if you are one that understands simple and complex patterns in video games. One difference between this game is the excess of bosses per level. In level one, I encountered near two bosses at one time, level two also around two bosses in the level and level three I have not figured out because I am continuing my progression in it.HardcoreHardcore mode limits you to only one hit point you can take for the whole game. This mode is for all of you, veterans if you find that earlier platformers in the 16-bit era and beyond are far too easy for you. If you are one that grew up with old-school games, spending the time to learn exact patterns, progressing faster than your average person, then give this mode a try. Standard mode has checkpoints. In the case that you die when facing a boss, it will bring you back to the start of the area you began at, but places you behind a couple or few doors before the boss will appear again. You must fight some of the same enemies you did before, but it is not difficult if you remember the exact layout of the maps in which you had run through.  I am upset that the developer did not provide any explanation behind this hardcore game mode. We don't know how fast the enemies attack, whether they take more damage to kill nor whether the bosses have more attacks and different moves than in the standard difficulty.Although, I understand that it is not necessary but a sufficient condition that would be a nice addition for others to know before they start hardcore mode, I feel it is needed to educate all of us. When I play a platform game like this, I want to know, up front, the statistics of all of the enemies and bosses. How much health they have in quantifiable numbers, the percentage of damage that our candy corn attack does, as well as gathering an idea of the enemy types. Developer, if you get a chance to read this review, please include an update as a short ' how to play' which will describe these specific aspects I have mentioned. I believe it will be useful for every gamer that plays Halloween Forever to get a better understanding and comprehension of the game.Overall/ Verdict - 9/10Gameplay, Presentation, Graphics, Mechanics, Replayability and Impact on Modern-Day GamesGameplay: 10/10Presentation :10/10 The presentation is one of the best I have seen to market it properly as an old-school platformer spooring, abafting downward in the genre's epoch with a nice shade of bright colors such as red, brown, green and orange with also some neutrals put in such as black and grey in the castle levels, the same as Castlevania. The contrast and lighting of colors complement each other one-hundred percent that gives immersion and nostalgia. Thankfully, someone has finally got it right.Graphics: 10/10 Graphics are perfect, precise cell-shading and a great blend of neutral colors as stated above.Mechanics: 10/10 - The fun of Mario ' Thwomps' with floating skeletons, chainsaw men and you get to vomit candy corn. ;)Replayability: 8/10 -  While it is as replayable as other old-school platformers, once you find out all other patterns, there is nothing more to seeLength: 5/10 - It looks shorter than expected but at $5.00 full price, is worth the retail price.Impact: 10/10"

,Recommended,425650,33177015,Posted: 3 July,all,BlazeHedgehog,"Halloween Forever isn't going to blow your mind.But does it have to? Is there a rule out there that says all games must contain XYZ amount of... I dunno, new ideas?Actually, that feels unfair to Halloween Forever, because as far as games go, this character, this type of shooter, in this setting, IS actually pretty unique. Just don't expect Shovel Knight. This is a short, simple, charming little game about Halloween with 8-bit graphics and chiptune music.It would be easy to write this game off as being too simple, too bland, but there are hallmarks that the developers actually cared. Simple as it may be, this is a tough little game to finish, particularly because it doesn't save your progress -- a move that seems to be done intentionally. It'll save which secret characters you've unlocked, but as far as actually playing this game goes, it gives you no quarter. 1ups are scarce, death comes quickly, and there are no continues. Game Over means starting back at level 1.Shockingly, the game doesn't feel cheap for doing this. Halloween Forever isn't a game that feels mean, or like it's punishing you for being less than perfect. It just asks that you value every move you take, and play smart. There's no masochism here, just focus.Secrets are well hidden without being too obscure OR too obvious, a lot of achievements involve doing things you might not normally think to do (including a couple of weirdly challenging ones). All around, it's pretty solid.For five bucks? Less, if it's on sale? You won't see many articles celebrating this as a masterclass in anything, but I say go for it. It's a good little game and I am satisfied with it."
,Recommended,425650,30604179,Posted: 18 March,all,t. mike,"The appeal of Halloween Forever appears limited, being released on Halloween and being themed after the holiday itself. The stylistic choices disguise a masterfully-crafted platformer, however. The art style appears simple, but is amazingly detailed. It’s difficult, but not too difficult. It’s short, but the wealth of secrets and optional characters (all with different playstyles) will keep you coming back for more. Like the best NES platformers, Halloween Forever offers a really fun challenge that never overstays its welcome."

When you run out of lives, you start from the beginning, which isn't a big issue as the game can be  beaten in under an hour.

The look of the game is cute and the gameplay is challenging enough to keep you playing it over and over. definitely worth $3 even though the game isn't particularly long. Love the general Halloween theme and very basic story in the game which will make it a Halloween game that I play every year! I hope the creator makes more games like this, or even makes a longer sequel.Cons: Only con I really have about the game is that once you lose an actual life you are not able to regain it in any way that I have been able to find. So while this really just adds another level of difficulty to the game, it was frustrating that if you happened to have a bad run there was no way to recover before getting to the next level or boss!"

It's really fun, and the Halloween spooky setting is awesome. If you're into old retro platformers like this, you'll most likely enjoy this, BUT my short game time is representative of the games length. My 0.7 game time is after I played through the game multiple times with a couple game overs.Even though this is still classed as being in ""Early Access"" the developer has said this release is finished as he originally intended, but there will be more updates to the game, fixing things, adding new levels and extra content.As I, and everyone, pretty much said, this game is very short. Even though I very much enjoyed my time with it, I almost lean towards not recommending it because of it's length... But if you're into this genre, for the price of £1.99 and the promise of extra content coming later, I think you'd be right to try Halloween Forever out.EDIT: Thinking about it, £1.99 is a little much for such a short short game. Maybe wait for a sale if you don't want to spend your spare couple pounds (dollars, euros, whatever) on this :P"

I meant what I said when I said that it is much like classic NES side scrollers because boy it is difficult, 3 lives and when you die you start straight from the beginning, luckily there are checkpoint so if you only die once or twice you don't start again but on that third death you're screwed.

The game is good but the big problem is that it's very short and too easy. At $5 it's a tiny bit over priced considering I beat it in under 30 minutes. The first secret character is incredibly OP and can destroy bosses very easily. But it's one of ""those"" games. You know what I'm talking about? It's one of ""those"" games where you beat it, but if you didn't find every single secret and secret character then you technically didn't fully beat it just like Ghosts 'n Goblins.The controls are good. The sprite work and music are superb. This would fit right alongside Monster Party and Splatter House Wanpaku Graffiti. And it's not a bad game at all.

Already put in 3 hours and still haven't managed to make it past the third level yet! Just as unforgiving as the original side scrollers, but still fair. 10/10 must have!"

If you were a fan of old SNES Mario games, you'll probably enjoy this. I've had a lot of fun with this game. Taking a break for the moment. I can only fall onto spikes so much. My body wasn't ready for the penetration it witnessed.Side-note: felt great playing a punishing game again."

It's nostalgic, it's fun, it's amazing to play on a warm halloween night surrounding yourself with bowls of candy and scary stories. There's so many characters, runes, levels and bosses. The progress that's been made with this game is breathtaking.10/10 spookies"

Had a much better time blowing $5.00 on this than renting a movie, even if it is a bit one the short side.Pros:+Cheap+Multiple playable characters+Cool bosses+Spooky jams+Good boss spritesCons:-30 fps-Few leaps of faith-Instakill spikes-Mediocre basic enemy sprite work8/10 would buy over Eat, Pray, Love"
,Recommended,425650,26404004,"Posted: 3 November, 2016",all,SuperPokeunicorn,"I really love this game. The visual and sound design is just oozing polish and the character designs are very charming. The gameplay is straightforward, a simple jump and shooter, but that simplicity is perhaps the game's greaest strength, and the variety of enemy and level designs make for an enjoyable experience. This developer clearly knows what they are doing when it comes to game design. Some may complain about the game overs, but I like how the game forced me to actually improve my play. You can't possibly make it to the end playing recklessly. In this way, the game truly captures the NES spirit (Get it? Spirit? Halloween? I'll see myself out.). The game would be way too easy and over too soon without game overs. Even then, the game is somewhat short; I managed to complete the game with all 6 runes and unlock all 4 playable characters in about 100 minutes. But, at this price range and with how much I enjoyed my time with it, I'd recommend Halloween Forever to anyone looking to scratch that NES itch."
,Recommended,425650,26324444,"Posted: 30 October, 2016",all,eou,"This is a decent platformer.To start off, let me make something clear. This is a ""retro platformer"". It isn't a game with ""classic platforming"" like some of the bigger titles (e.g. Shovel Knight), but rather a platformer reminiscent of an early platformer, or more specifically, an NES game. As such, it's a simple game, one that revolves around five stages, with one + three unlockable characters to play as. Alongside that, as like many other retro platformers, when you lose all your lives, you start over.The character you can play as until you unlock others is Pumpkin Man, what he looks like is self-explanatory, and he shoots out candy corn from his mouth as a projectile. All of the characters' projectiles are pretty similar, following a trajectory similar to half a circle. The most different one is the last unlockable character's, which shoots out tiny familiars which will either hit a damageable object or move across the ground until they find something to hit (or disappear if they find nothing). As for unlocking these, characters, you have to simply take the more difficult or hidden paths in certain levels, and I believe there's a chance of you either receiving a life or a character unlock (I got the first two in a row, but the last one wasn't immediate).The gameplay itself isn't bad, but nor is it really anything to speak much about. I could compare it to Mega Man (the original), however it would be an extremely simplified version of what you'd see in Mega Man. The enemies you fight aren't very special, in fact most of them simply move about unless they end up hitting into you. There also aren't any puzzles, and the few secrets that exist can barely be called secrets; I think of them more as ""alternate paths"". Even so, the level design remains very linear, as the ""alternate paths"" very quickly converge (or even immediately) with the normal path.As for the bosses, there are two for every stage. They all pretty much move across the level in a cycle, i.e. back and forth, shooting different projectiles at you. There really isn't much to them, and it isn't very hard to find out how to beat any of the bosses in mere seconds. I'd go as far to say that the first boss is one of the more difficult ones, and he's not exactly what you'd call ""difficult"" anyway. As for an example of how easy they are, one of the bosses has 3 floors that you can alternate between, and the boss just slides across the floors one-by-one, with floating mobs spawning every so often. It does nothing outside of this, and unless you rush, it's very, VERY hard to actually receive any damage from it. Regardless, they're not displeasing or boring or anything like that.Moving on to the ""art"" aspects, it's overall not too bad. While the indoor backgrounds are pretty lacking (as they're all very similar to each other), the outdoors aren't so bad, and the character and enemy art/animations are all pretty cute. My favorite thing from the game in fact is the laughing animation the Pumpkin Man makes when you hold the attack button, which is extremely cute to me. I love that. I thought it'd be cool if you'd be able to eat fire with it or something, but eh. It's still really cute. The music is pretty nice too, and while the tracklist is extremely short, the stages are pretty short too, so nothing ever overstays its welcome.It doesn't bring too much ""new"", and while I can say that it could use some extra ""flavor"", it's by no means bad. It's a rather enjoyable, short experience, and to my surprise, not too hard to return to. As it is, I can very easily say that it was worth it, and for five dollars, even more so."

Pixel graphics, 8-Bit soundtrack and amazing and very responsive controls have me constantly playing this game and never feeling as though the game is unfair at times. I highly recommend this game if you're into the good ol days of hard-yet-rewarding platformers or want to take on a fresh new game."

,Recommended,425650,35423728,Posted: 2 October,all,ShadowGoo,"Grabbed this cute little game last year as a seasonal buy when it was in early access and don't regret it a bit. It's a sweet, humble little game for Halloween lovers. There's a lot of hard ""retro-styled"" games out there, but I feel like this one does ""retro difficulty"" very fairly. There's no continues so losing all your lives puts you back at stage 1, but the game is only five levels long, and you can grab a couple extra lives to work with if you know where to look. It's not super hard, but not a cakewalk either. Watch those insta-death spikes though."
