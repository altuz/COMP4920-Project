It still takes ten putts to get it in the hole once you're right next to it because you keep hitting it just to the side of the hole."

You can play on one vive but you'll have to switch the headset a lot. If the developer is reading this, I suggest in addition to asking the number of players, have an option to play XX amount of holes before switching, i.e. switch every 3 holes and player 1 plays holes 1-3 and then player 2 plays 1-3. Or 5 or 9 or whatever. I think this would make local multiplayer less tiresome.Create your own miniput levels, so now I can prove my 12 year old self right when I had said I'd be able to make the best miniput holes.You can play other people's creations which are up/down voted by the community and make your own custom courses with them.Par 42 hole? Yup it's there. Cannons, fans, bumpers. Different club lengths appear to have different speeds so you can choose the one you like best to get the best feel.Sometimes there are physics issues where you hit it in a way you didn't expect but these don't detract much.Graphics are beautiful and simple, very relaxing.Pro-tip: Disable the music in the settings. You will thank me.Another suggestion for the developer: Maybe have a zoom function in the editor to allow you to work with bigger pieces, unless it's there and I'm blind. Sometimes it's hard to work with when they're small. We have a minimum 2x2 meter space, let's use it!!EDIT: There is a zoom function, labelled 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x on the left side, I just didn't see it. Though it would be useful to be able to drag your entire creation, but I'm not sure how to do this. I built mine accidentally into the edge of my playspace."

The motion controls are pretty much perfect, and this is probably the closest you can get to actual minigolf without leaving your room. The courses are another matter entirely; some of them are pretty standard, like the usual 3 or 4 par traditional courses you'd see on a real mingolf course, but some of them are enormous sprawling 40+ par courses filled with ball cannons. rotating obstacles, half-pipe curves, and more that are really fun to play with a friend. It has both online and local multiplayer, with the local play involving each player playing the course and then passing the headset to the next player. It may not be the most exciting game on the Vive, but if you've got friends who are up for some minigolf you can get a pretty good time out of this."

The game uses one touch controller for the putter and is based on physics, some skill, and dumb luck of course.  It comes with 18 holes but there are alot of user made holes thatre pretty good and accessible through the game.  I like to play a random nine in the games standard course for now.  I think this game is worth it, for the good VR mini golf experience and the workshop support."

That is not in the game yet but will be coming with a future update. I still enjoyed the game although I don’t really have the patience for it and some of the holes are frustrating.Pros:After hitting the ball you can press the trigger button and instantly warp to your balls current location. This is perfect and necessary for a game like this.Controls felt good, after a couple test swings I felt like I knew exactly how hard I need to hit it. The haptics on the controller were spot on as well.Good course design. I personally like the simple wholes like you would find at an actual minigolf place but if you are a fan of wacky and difficult this game will cater to you as well.Graphics are well done.Cons:Frustrating at times, I played hole that had a Par of 42??? It was fun for maybe the first 5 or 6 hits then it was just annoying and I was swinging like a madman trying to finish it. It may be I don’t have the patience for it, I am sure some people will love it.No spectator mode: If you have people that are trying to watch your game on the TV/Monitor it will only show what the person playing is looking at so it ends up being really shakey and not enjoyable to watch. I am not sure how they could fix this maybe incorporate a 3rd person spectator mode.TLDR:The game is fun don’t get me wrong. I recommend it on a sale, but personally I only like about half of the holes. The simple ones are a lot of fun but holes that are just crazy and have par 42 were not enjoyable and made me lose my patience. There is not a whole lot of content as of writing this review but I hope with future updates and free DLC more content and courses are added. I think if the Devs made the courses more like 3D Ultra Minigolf it would be fantastic, I think it would be cool to have multiplayer where you could use powerups and such it would make it an insane party game."

Also actually getting the club to hit the ball requires some finesse as you can easily end up ghosting right through it. Also the physics are bugged, with the ball reliably bouncing backwards away off a gentle slope. Not the best vr game out there, needs work, but at its core it's still fun. the bugs just push it toward the edge of frustration. Still did all 18 holes.

The game has an online mode but at the time of writing this it is a ghost town, so don't expect too much competition. I'm looking very forward to the course editor which should add even more replay value to this game. Bottom line is, if you're going to spend $20 on a VR game this is the way to go, a lot of games for the same price out there feel more like a proof of concept and not a complete game.Warning to any achievement completionists out there, this game has a few bugged achievements that I cannot get to unlock no matter how many times I complete the criteria."

Boasting a solid put mechanic, intuitive room-scale and click-to-teleport locomotion, this game is definitely up to par. I have not tried any user generated content yet, the official course has kept me more than happy. The gameplay feels very realistic, though getting your stroke down can be a bit trying as you don't have the weight of an actual club. This game delivers on the familiarity of minigolf while adding elements only available in a digital format- such as moving blocks, cannons, fans, and other obstacles that would be either impossible or impractical in the real world.Pros:+Great headtracking, room-scale, and click-to-teleport locomotion.+Official course is very well designed and a pleasure to play.+Feels like the real thing.+Pleasing visuals.+Putting is consistent once you get a feel for the motion range.Cons:-Local multiplayer is workable, but a hassle. Not really recommended as a party game since you're going to be constantly having to adjust the straps. God forbid someone is wearing glasses and you have to adjust the lenses too.-My localisation appears to be broken. I get random chinese characters on some menu elements and buttons. This is not a gamebreaking issue though since the menus are intuitive enough to guess and get by.-Would be nice if they could introduce a control mechanic to ghost/materialize your club. Theres been times where I've accidentally hit the ball while I'm just trying to look around.-Casual players can become frustrated at the difficulty of some holes, bringing down the mood of the group.

This game will remain fun as long as there are content creators making new holes for you to easily subscribe too.I bought the game on sale for $10 bucks, because of that I scale my review against the weight of $10 dollars as opposed to $15, which for some $5 may not matter, for others it may. I feel I got my worth at the $10 dollar price point even if I don't play this game again. I will however continue to explore the community made maps and eventually dabble in creating a few of my own.In conclusion, congrats to the Devs for making something that somewhat suprised me and I hope it sees continued support in the future."

The local multi-player works by trading the headset off with the other players after you have completed your hole, so it doesn't require you to trade off the headset after every shot which is good because it would likely lead to a lot of fatigue and annoyance trying to put the headset on and off. Only downside to this is that you can't hit your friends golf balls when they're in your way (since the hole is finished for them) on the course which I'm sure would lead to some funny situations. The online multilayer is not available yet so I will update my review later when that is released.You can set up the course for a full 18 or a random 9. I'd recommend going for the random 9 if you have 4 people playing because it takes a long time to get through 18. We stopped after we got past the 9th hole because it was getting late (it took an hour and a half.)I haven't had the chance to check out the course editor.My biggest gripe with the game is that you can accidentally hit your ball if the club hits it as you're switching the controller over to the next player. Only advance to the next person's turn when they are fully ready. Devs: perhaps add the option to make the club semi transparent and unable to hit the ball unless you're gripping one of the grip buttons on the side of the Vive controller. It would increase the presence because you have to 'grip' the controller in real life as one would do with an actual putter.That being said, even without the online multilayer being available and without trying the course editor, I think this is worth the price especially considering a round of mini golf in your local area would likely cost a lot more just for one round if you and 3 of your friends all wanted to play (not to mention all the possible parking fees, crying babies, allergies, loud noises, falling into stagnant ponds, and alligators that you'll have to deal with.)"

After you hit the ball you can take a few steps to the side and watch the ball navigate the course... that is so cool.This game is like playing Mini-golf in The Witness environment, I really like the visual style.  Hitting the ball and swinging the club is extremely polished and feels great.  I love how they implemented the club in your hands.  The levels are great, I want more but I also want to replay the Full 18 dozens of times to perfect my score.  There were plenty of places where it felt like you were just taking random skillless swings but that is just like real minigolf.  And your neck will get sore staring down at the ball which is just like real minigolf!  You will even get frustrated with your shots and continually bat the ball forward just like real minigolf!There are some bugs, primarily I don't know why it shows the floor grid even after I select ""Don't show the grid"" from the options menu.  Also when you center the player on the ball it seems like sometimes it doesn't place you centered on the ball.  I haven't figured out what is happening there.  The music is also extremely repetitive.  Is the music sample only 1.5 seconds long placed on loop (""dut dun dun dunnn DUN"" is repeating in my head over and over and over)?  Maybe add an option where you can't swing unless you are standing above the actual course (versus floating off-course), this would add to the challenge associated with landing a shot near the walls.  You could implement it the way The Gallery does when you walk out of the game area.With these minor issues the game is still fantastic.

,Not Recommended,425720,24398940,"Posted: 18 July, 2016",all,MC Whitey,"I do not recommend this game for several reasons.  First off, some of the courses are so ridiculously hard that there is no fun in there at all.  Secondly, sometimes when you teleport to your ball, if you are holding your arm in the wrong spot, your club will hit your ball and you'll lose a stroke for no other reason than you teleported.  Thirdly, the programming is off sometimes -- I literally swung through my ball several times.  I could see the putter passing right through the ball, yet it wouldn't hit it.  Fourthly, when I want to hold onto my controller tightly since I want to swing hard, I inevitably hit the grip buttons, and this brings up the score card and invalidates my swing.  There is no way to disable the scorecard opening when clicking the grib buttons that I can see, so this is terribly annoying.  Lastly, there is no way that I can see that you can change the orientation, so I'm sometimes forced to stand facing a direction where my controller sometimes loses tracking.  There should be a simple way to change the orientation so I can stand facing a different direction.  Unfortunately the makers of the game decided not to give the player that opportunity.  For all of these reasons, I cannot recommend this game.  There is a lot of promise to VR mini-golf, but the developers have a lot of work to do it make it an enjoyable experience."

Here are a few of the things I have problems with:I think the developers need to work on better helping with the timing issues, looking down to line up your shot and trying to look up to see when the windmill or whatever is in the right position does not work well with a Vive on your face.Some of the level design is nice, some of it is terrible. If you have par 42, it's not going to be fun unless you are a real masochist, leave it out. If you have to reverse your orientation 15 times on a hole, then maybe peoplle with a huge cable attached to there heads will have some issues. Needs work."

76561197968761535,Not Recommended,425720,23837770,"Posted: 26 June, 2016",all,AnD4D,"I originally bought this game back in April, before I got my Vive. I refunded it after minutes of playing it. The Vive wasn't designed to spend so long staring at the ground. On top of that, graphics were flickering, and at one point, the world started twisting and swaying, forcing me to pull the headset off, and gave me a headache for 2 hours.In the Summer sale, I thought I'd try it again. After all, months later, the game may have improved.Well... no. Not really. The graphical glitches are still there, with textures visible loading in, but that's not the problem.The game, for me at least, is too faulty by design. For example, after teleporting to the ball, rather than repositioning the player in a logical position, the game simply does so based on a fixed geographical angle. By this I mean if you're facing North when you hit the ball, and the direction between the resulting shot lines the ball and the hole in a south direction... when you teleport, you'll remain facing North, rather than the game predicting where you should be standing. This means that you then have to walk around the room in a tiny circle, making sure that you, physically, are now facing the correct direction.This results in the Vive, with its tethered cables, constantly twisting up. On top of this, the number of times I accidentally touched the ball with my bat while I'm turning around, and adding to my 'score'. This could easily be prevented by having the player pull the trigger or push the touch pad to retract the club, or even require it to be held when taking a shot. Of course, this wouldn't really be an issue if they just fixed the orientation.With this in mind, swapping the headset during a multiplayer game, each turn, doubled, tripled or even quadrupled the tangling issue. After our 2 minute game, my wife and I had to spend a few minutes unravelling the headset.The fixes for these 2 issues are easy and should be obvious. A path finding system would enable the game to predict where the player would want to stand, and effectively rotate the level for them, rather than them needing to rotate so much.Order of play should be based on last on, first on. This means to say whomever has the headset on at the end of the hole gets to play the first hole on the next game. This reduces (potentially halves) the number of times the headset needs to be taken off. At the moment, the game lets whomever is winning stay on. This means that a close game makes it hard to predict who is next to play.I'll not risk my headset cabled getting damaged simply because the developers can't figure out such simple solutions.At one point, we started the game, and immediately accidently touched the ball. Even though it hadn't even left the wooden start space, it counted that as a hit. We then quit the game, and tried to start again. From here, we couldnt figure out how the change the player names. As we'd done it once before, the game didn't ask us a second time. Very frustrating. I'd like to be able to choose who goes first.Another bug bear is that the menu itself is a golf game. ""Want to play? Knock the ball into this gate!"" Why slow down a menu? Just allow us to point and select. I don't want to play a game so that I can play the game!Finally, the hit detection is odd. At one point, I swang the club quite fast, and it went through the ball. It moved less than an inch, but still classed it as a stroke. Add that to the fact that there didn't appear to be any music playing, and the game was more hassle than fun."

Nuff said...Long Review:Cloidlands: VR Minigolf is as close to playing real Minigolf as you're gonna get (hence the short review).Pros:It's Minigolf in VR.The distance the ball goes relative to the power in your swing feels accurate.Great graphics. The pics on the steam store page accurate.Better than real life Minigolf in the sense that if a ball is close to a wall, you can wack the ball through the wall instead of having to nudge it away.There's local and online multiplayer, a rare feature in VR games. For local multiplayer, you give the headset to someone else when it's their turn, and online multiplayer just works.Nice variety in the holes.Cons:There's only one course of 18 holes (as of the time I'm writing this). Because of this it doesn't take long to go through the entire game and there's very little replayability.No voice chat in online multiplayer. The Vive has a mic, so there's no reason it shouldn't be in there.This isn't the Devs' fault, but it's a bit odd using the Vive controler as a golf club, at least for me. Don't get me wrong, it works. It's just doesn't feel like a golf club, probably because it isn't.In Conclusion:If you love Minigolf, go ahead and buy it. If you hate Minigolf, don't buy it. If you're in the middle, I'd get it on sale. I don't think it's worth the $20 in it's current state (as of the time I'm writing this). If they add more than one course I can see people paying full price for it, but untill then I'd wait till it's on sale for $10 or so."
,Recommended,425720,22992859,"Posted: 14 May, 2016",all,Sexy Boat Captain,"This is a really really good VR version of Mini Golf.  I watched the videos and read the reviews, then decided to try it and it's a great game!  It was way above my expectations.  I've got a 980 TI, a subpar i5 and I've got my Lighthouses way too far apart (close to 20 feet) and I had no stuttering or anything.  The gameplay is actually really fun and a lot of thought and time was obviously put into the courses and the environment.  This isn't a slapped together game, it's pretty polished.  In my opinion, the complaints about the club are more in the nit picking range.  It should probably have an option to ghost the club so you don't accidentally hit the ball, and sometimes the hit registration is a little off if you move the club around too much near the ball (which are easy to avoid once you figure out what causes it), but whether these get fixed or not (Update - It's totally user error, I just played three rounds and never accidentally hit it once, I think it's just that when you start playing, you don't control the club properly), the game is still a great game.  Definitely worth the $20.Updating my review.  Just played multiplayer and it's awesome!  So far this is my favorite Vive game.  If you've ever played mini golf and enjoyed it even a little bit, you'll love this even more because you don't have working cannons in regualr mini golf.  If you're a serious golfer, then you probably won't like this because it's mini golf and I'd guess serious golfers wouldn't like mini golf out of principle.Another thing too, the game actually looks a lot better in VR than it does in the videos."

Also I would like if they did more holes based on skill rather than luck , with all the high powered fans, cannons and spike traps it just takes away from the experience.When playing mini golf in real life you dont need any of these this and it still remains fun, Why do the developers feel its so important to change the game so much.But on the whole I would recommend this title due to the fact its multiplayer ( pass the headset at the end of the hole ) so everyone can get involved."
