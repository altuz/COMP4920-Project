My damage was severely nerfed so It took me like 5 minutes to clear a room when right before I quit I was clearing rooms within 10 seconds with all the upgrades/purples/enchants I have.Possibly a problem with the levelling multipliers getting reset when you log out?Level 56 currently and I can't die, my survivabillity is through the roof, but I saw my damage go from over 3-4k/hit to around 800, and the healing mobs outheal my damge because they heal around 3500/tick at this point in the game..something to look in to, because its not fun at all anymore, taking a year to progress through one floor."

Wish they would team up to make the best of both worlds.^^Played the first 2 levels and I must say the dodging, blocking and attacking feels great.Downsides are on the sound design (not bad, but you can tell there are some free stock sounds in there), graphical detail (the head of your character looks a bit like a potato) and trashmob design (like 1-3 mobs per room instead of typical arpg hordes, bosses were fine tho)The gameplay is nice and you get a good variety of weapons and attacks early on. Good idea to put the skills on the gear like in Path of Exile, but without the headaches. Combat is strategic but fast-paced, some attacks can be reflected with your shield, when you activate it at the right time. You can avoid most, if not all of the damage in a skill based way, there's no gear checks.Can't comment on the amout of content, but for me getting a feel of addiction out of a 8$ game is already hard to accomplish, so I'm good either way.Update: Played about 1.5h and I'm halfway through, it only gets better so far and you can keep the weapons and gear you like all the way through the game, by upgrading it at a merchant. There's one in every level. The levels feel a bit like in Binding of Isaac, like you're travelling through linked shoeboxes, so there's not alot of exploration and immersion going on. It has the upside, that you don't spend alot of time out of combat and it keeps everything fast-paced.Update: Played up to NG+8 now, found some things that I didn't like/might need fixing:- W̶h̶e̶n̶ ̶I̶ ̶w̶h̶i̶r̶l̶w̶i̶n̶d̶ ̶t̶h̶r̶o̶u̶g̶h̶ ̶e̶n̶e̶m̶i̶e̶s̶,̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶s̶c̶r̶e̶e̶n̶ ̶s̶h̶a̶k̶e̶s̶ ̶l̶i̶k̶e̶ ̶c̶r̶a̶z̶y̶,̶ ̶l̶i̶k̶e̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶0̶.̶5̶-̶1̶ ̶s̶e̶c̶ ̶i̶n̶t̶e̶r̶v̶a̶l̶s̶ ̶a̶l̶l̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶t̶i̶m̶e̶ ̶w̶h̶i̶l̶e̶ ̶a̶t̶t̶a̶c̶k̶i̶n̶g̶.̶  (Got fixed :D)- C̶a̶n̶'̶t̶ ̶s̶o̶r̶t̶ ̶y̶o̶u̶r̶ ̶i̶n̶v̶e̶n̶t̶o̶r̶y̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶k̶e̶e̶p̶ ̶t̶r̶a̶c̶k̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶w̶h̶a̶t̶ ̶y̶o̶u̶ ̶w̶a̶n̶t̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶k̶e̶e̶p̶.̶  (You can move stuff to the top, thats good enough for me.)- Some items in the shop show way too low damage numbers, like a 18 damage whirlwind attack on a level 124 bloodrenders. They are fine again, when you buy it tho.- Guardian trinket has a duration of 0.0 sec, seemed to do nothing for me.- Can't rebind special attack to M2. I'm fine with having M1 hardcoded to move, but it would be nice for builds that don't use normal attack.- Started a new game on hard, during the first run the difficulty was just challenging enough, but in NG+ I don't  feel a difference to normal anymore. Having rejuvenating on boots and guardian on the attack you use, breaks pretty much everything the game throws at you.That's all for now, I didn't run into any bad bugs or anything and still love the game."

76561198053003844,Recommended,425820,20116712,"Posted: 30 December, 2015",all,GlahhGlahhhPow,"Dragonpath is a very fun game and it's much like any other dungeon crawler. DP offers more fast paced action however. The downside of this game is how short it is. To charge more than 5 dollars for this is a crime. I beat the game in about less than 2 hours. And to top it off, there is no replay value in the game at the moment due to bugs. The enemies one shot you. And upon starting a game after beating it the first time, your character is just stuck in place. Pick this game up in a couple of months after it has been fixed. Right now its a waste of money.Edit: Most of the above issues seem to have been fixed. Theres a bit of a scaling issue at later levels. with 100+ lvl items, it becomes a cakewalk with damage reduced gear. I was being hit for like 2 damage with over 80% damage reduction."
,Recommended,425820,29300381,Posted: 16 January,all,Black Puppet,"What a curious little game we have here. I didnt think I would enjoy it as much as I did after playing it for a few minutes. You know, most of these type of games end up trying to be just another ""Binding of Isaac"" or even worse try to copy ""Nuclear Throne"" or even ""Enter the Gungeon"". And with worse, I mean that they actually try copying games instead of trying to be like the game.So what does this game do? A full on hand to hand combat with eventual ranged based weaponry that also needs some form of aim to actually hit the target. You cannot go in to this game and hope to just spam the attack button to get through the game. You need to dodge the attacks, heal yourself if you have to and make sure that you survive. And while you dont die forever on a normal playthrough you can always make it harder with the ""one life"" option.If I would have to pinpoint something down that confuses me and even annoys me a tiny bit then its the controlls. They are most certainly not the best but also not the worst. You can get around them and play with them no matter what and that without doing a full on breakdance on your keyboard. Devil May Cry 2, I am looking at you!But let me be fully honest here on what I thought I would get at first. I thought this title looked very interesting. I got in and it surprised me that it didnt look as I expected it to. Especially as you dont even know how to play the game so it took some time to get used to it. And at first I thought to return it. But now, after just a few minutes, I really do like it and I recommend you people to at the very least give it a try. It is quite good at what it does and apart from dungeoneering which even BoI took inspiration from Zelda, its overly original in what it has to offer."

At least that was a problem when using an Xbox 360 controller. The player screen graphics could use some work.Other than that, very enjoyable. Had a great bit of fun playing it. I'd like to see a few more abilities introduced a lot of them seemed similar with some retextures or tweaked numbers."
76561198112169882,Recommended,425820,28195598,"Posted: 4 December, 2016",all,But I'm a Crepe,"I just beat this game in one three-hour playthrough, so, considering that I was compelled to play this game to the end, I thought it would be worth my time to describe the nuances of this hidden EA gem.====================================================================================Short ReviewThe game is centered around fast-paced, isometric, hack-and-slash combat, and succeeds: It is simply fun and captivating. The UI is friendly, there is replayability, and the tutorial is incredibly helpful to the degree that the long review isn't neccessary. There is a demo so that you can try said tutorial and first few levels. There are alot of similarities in the combat to Dark Souls, so I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys those games for its combat.====================================================================================Long Reviewif you are not a fan of the Souls games, but are still interested in this game, or just want to know more in depth before purchase, read on!First, theUser Interface (UI):At first glance, the UI in conjuntion with the isometric camera suggests that this game will play mechanically like Diablo, Torchlight, or Path of Exile (all of which I have played, but none of which have greatly captivated me). However, I was plesantly surprised to find that Dragonpath plays more like the From Software's Souls Series, my favorite franchise of all time. The UI is functional and user-friendly, via labeling your custom key/controller bind above each action and explaining each function via mouseover. Speaking of key binds, all actions have costom binds: once upon a time you couldn't unbind the mouse buttons. So, if you, like me, are a fan of Dark Souls, you can be blocking with L1, attacking with R1/R2, interacting with A, dodging with B, using items with X, and healing with Y, and feel right at home with the controller support.The Level Design:Dragonpath's levels consists of a combat-free starting room, which progresses through combat rooms all the way to the boss room, which upon completion, you can proceed to the next level. The UI features a mini-map, depicting the starting room with a gateway, the boss with a skull, the merchant with a treasure chest, and the room with a secret with a question mark. The mini-map depicts the level as a series of blocks, each representing a room that can be entered or exited in the four cardinal directions if adjacent to another block/room. The levels, and subsequent rooms, with the exception of the secret rooms, are dull and uninspiring by nature of the isometric camera and genre. Furthermore, the level design strongly reminds me of Bloodborne's Chalice Dungeons: the Chalice Dungeons were completely optional, and represented FromSoft's attempt to incorperate rougelite elements into the Souls genre, which failed spectacularly. So despite Dragonpath's repetitive and dull level and room design, I enjoy this game more than Bloodborne's Chalice Dungeons.Combat/Game Mechanics: The meat of the game, the combat. There are alot of similarities between this and Dark Souls/Bloodborne, so trying to avoid tangents, here is a consise list of what to expect:You have a health bar and mana bar.You gain health by killing enemies and completing rooms or drinking finite healing potions. Mana automatically regens.Health potions are bought from the merchant or looted from enemies.You are equipped with a melee weapon, a ranged weapon, a trinket, and a blessing.You need to switch between melee and ranged, trinkets and blessings are always usable via hotkey.Default/primary/light attacks do not use mana, nor have cooldowns (you can eternally stunlock weaker enemies with the likes of a greatsword).Secondary/strong attacks, trinkets, blessings, blocking and dodging require mana and do have cooldowns.Dodging grants invincibility frames for a brief time, blocking redirects damage taken to a temporary defence bar that appears in blue over your health bar.There is a brief initial window in your block ability where you can reflect projectiles back at the attacker.you find new weapons and trinkets frequently off of slain enemies.enemy actions are displayed via text and highlights attack directions or AoE locations that aren't destracting, allowing combat to be fast-paced while still being fair and giving the player time to react.A gold ring sorrounding an enemy indicates who you are targeting.You will automatically attack in the direction of the enemy with the gold ring, so you don't have to manually aim ranged attacks with the mouse.There is an option to manually aim ranged weapons, since they fire projectiles and not hitscan.To put it simply, it's just plain fun. The game encourages you to try the new weapons you pick up. While weapon balance via category is primarily defined by attack speed versus damage output (calculated to damage per second, DPS), the secondary attack is what makes each weapon unique. They may also be enchanted with passive abilities such as chance to apply poison, chance to heal, etc.Miscellaneous(Primarily comparing to Dark Souls)Potions heal for 30% HP and are not instantanious (you can't spam heal 3 times in a bind w/o being punished).Story/exposition is presented through item descriptions via mouseover, and books found in the merchant room. It does not deter from the action, you can ignore it all.You lose a small percentage of your current XP permenantly upon death, and respawn in the starting room with 80% health (regained via health potion or defeating enemies whilst not losing further health).Rooms you've cleared have a small chance of respawning enemies upon return, even after death. These encounters are generally easier than the initial one.Leveling up offers increases in HP, movement speed, or mana regen by a percentage (suggesting worrior, rouge, and mage class troupes without being binding). Occasionally you will be offered a passive ability or your blessing.The game becomes bullet-hell against boss mages and are the most difficult and enjoyable to fight.THE GAME DOES NOT PAUSE WHEN YOU OPEN YOUR INVENTORY (Dark Souls fans, you know how this goes).There is no set difficulty, so if you don't like Dark Souls for it's brutal and punishing combat and are put off by all the comparisons I've made, you can play on easy and still enjoy hacking and slashing mobs to bits!Suggestions to the Devlopers(Quick aside, congrats! The game is awesome!)Add audio queues for weapon toggles (i.e. shotgun pump vs. unsheathing a sword) so I know what weapon I've just switched to.I am against the permanant loss of XP upon death. Normally I only die to bosses, and death is part of the learning process and thus should be encouraged. Throwing yourself at a boss until all the Mobs you defeated become worthless due to loss of XP takes away some of the satisfaction of accomplishment and results in being underleveled. I played this game on day 1 when death had no consequence whatsoever, and that made challenge vs. accomplishment unsatisying, so consequence is neccessary. What I suggest for compromise is that you must defeat the enemy who killed you to regain all of your experience. In the case of a boss, the boss must be damaged to a percentage of their health to regain XP. I would not be opposed to losing and regaining gold in this alternate mechanic as well, since I never felt compelled to spend any of it and didn't need to until midgame when I had 1000+ gold (and then I only bought a surplus of healing potions), so the fear of losing gold may provide insentive to spend it.===================================================================================="
,Recommended,425820,33003116,Posted: 29 June,all,-Austin,Amazing great little game I loved it. I have yet to do the co op and try out all the new patches and fixes but I still say get this game while the sell is on and try it out. You can beat the whole game in about 4 hours but the way you can attack the levels is always new and can be done differently since the skills are all in the weapons and armor.
76561197996506633,Recommended,425820,31169490,Posted: 15 April,all,jlynn81,"Partial Review Warning:in the time I have played this, I find this game pretty enjoyable to play so far. As it is shown in screenshots and vids for this game, this is a hack n' slash dungeon-crawler game that is rogue-like in a way that you can keep your loot but if you die, you lose experience but luckily not your loot. A price that is worthwhile.Graphics: while the models of the characters aren't the best, It is simple enough to do its job. Graphics aren't everything sometimes in games.Gameplay: There are 3 difficulty levels to pick and you can even chose to play it like a perma-death rogue game as an option. You have plenty of different attacks for each type of weapon you pick up or buy from merchants in the dungeons, so you always have plenty of options to deal with annoying enemies if a weapon or two don't work that you can change to see what would be best to take on a certain foe. Personal favorite so far is using the fire staff. You can even upgrade your weapons, armor and etc to improve their uses and stats. You level up by defeating enemies like any rpg game. The enemies in the game can be troublesome to deal with at times but the game lets you be able to block some attacks and a dash to avoid fast attacks. You'll be doing very much plenty of that so get used to it. The gameplay is what is worth playing the game for despite the graphics.Music and Sound: Ok music, but could be better.This is a partial review as I'm still somewhat in the beginning of the game so I'll give a full review when I complete it. But my impression of it so far that it's worth its full price. I can recommend buying it. When it's on sale, even more another reason to buy it. It's plenty cheap when on sale."

It's not often that I go out of the way to write a review, but I simply can't believe that this game hasn't gotten more notice since its release.The gameplay overall has a great sense of timing and distance, the boss battles are simple but fun (at least the few that I've played so far), and the effects are readable and enjoyable to watch. When I looked at this game for the first time I thought the art looked a little strange, but it didn't take long for my eyes to get used to the unique clay-doll-like aesthetic of the characters. The background music so far has been chill and not distracting.I haven't seen much of the story so far, so I can't really comment on it, but the setting seems interesting and I'm looking forward to seeing more of the weird lookin creatures in the dungeon.All in all, this is a great game to pick up for the price point, I can imagine getting much more than my money's worth out of it. I will definitely be getting my friends on board with this one."
