,Not Recommended,426010,22240594,"Posted: 4 April, 2016",all,ArthurPlays,"Womb Room is a rather strange game. The goal of the player is simply to die. There are chances that you will die by your own means or by accident. A single run of the game will take less than 5 minutes, but there was a single run that I played that ended before it started. I started the game and died as a baby before being born.The game is glitchy, however. All text would say ""Null"" and nothing else. I'm sure this was supposed to be replaced with some sort of reason behind my death. Some items clip through other things or the ground. I really wanted to like this game, but there's just not much to it.I'm sure my time with the game was bad simply because I couldn't tell what was going on with the ""Null"" problem.You roam around each room picking up things and setting them down. There's not much else to do in each room other than that. Then you walk through one of four doors and await your life on the other side hoping you made the right choice.I'd give this game a go I suppose if you have time to waste, otherwise don't waste your time with it."

,Not Recommended,426010,29046019,Posted: 5 January,all,XJ9,"I always wonder when I see mostly negative or mostly positive reviews on a game. Is this game THAT bad? Maybe people just don't understand. This time I was wrong :\-There is no actual game itself - you wander around with a super slow walking speed, picking up objects you cant interact with and picking doors, and they all leading to the same outcome.-There is a workshop and you can upload png pictures inside of the game, but you can't do anything with them :\ Seems broken.-If you try to pick any object when your game is in windowed mode - it minimizes the game window - so only full screen *playable*-No options other than the game resolution before you start the game. No controls remap. Nothing.-Horrible music and *ambient* sounds-When you reach the very last level with your tombstone - you have no option to complete the run. You can jump off a cliff but you will fall forever because devs forgot to set up the ground.+Steam achievements (is actually a minus cus you have to play this сrар)+Steam cards (take a note that devs forgot to put that info on the steam store page but there ARE steam cards)+Pressing ESC in any moment of the gameplay terminates the game instantly.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=835521904The game looks like if Edmund Mcmillen was high on drugs and decided to make a game similar to Isaac but in 3D and forgot to add.... like everything but that part where you read the reason of your death."
76561198035412387,Not Recommended,426010,22243585,"Posted: 4 April, 2016",all,Future Viking Gaming,I played 20 minutes of this game and knew that it needed work. First off it has no options and literally no UI once you have started the game you only have the option to quit or finish the game. Second the game is very short and has very little to no plot and with most of my outcomes my character would be dead before the teenage years. I see no point to play this game more than once and it is not worth 1.50~3.00$. I would suggest to the developer to make this game free and think about working on his coding a bit before actually selling his product.

After fooling around a bit though, you find that the item you choose tends to influence the next ""stage of life.""  In this regard, it's like the world's shortest choose your own adventure book.For people who want a funny experience, sure.For those that wanted a game- steer clear."

,Not Recommended,426010,27672318,"Posted: 26 November, 2016",all,Justyn,"Strange game. Was funny first couple of times I played it (Takes like 10 seconds to beat the game each time you play it). All you can do is walk, doesn't matter which door you enter to proceed. There is no actual gameplay in this game. You walk around and read text at the end of each level (Each level is approxamately 2-3 seconds long, and there are about 4 levels: Baby, Teen, Adult, Old Person). You always die at the end, awlays. Its depressing living through your entire life in a mere 10 seconds. The achievements are very difficult to get as each ending is random, and you will see the same ending several times before you get a new one."

The game runs fine but recently when I tried to run it I experienced several graphical errors. For the price the game is a neat litte way to entertain yourself.

I'm not giving this a negative review because of what this game does or how it does it - but because of what it DOESN'T do.It doesn't keep track of anything that's happened. At all.This means that you can end up homeless, and then die from shoveling snow off the roof of your house. There is zero attention paid to the very core reason this game exists - a contiguous life story."
