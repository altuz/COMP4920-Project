Then when you start playing, you'll realize that this is the kind of game Mass Effect was trying to evoke. It's part FTL and part A Mind Forever Voyaging. VERY text heavy, very well-written, and if that's your thing, you'll be in heaven. It really nails the look, feel, and gameplay of those early story-heavy games from back when people hadn't quite decided what story-heavy games were yet.Plus, you're a snarky ship's computer."
,Recommended,426290,24470043,"Posted: 22 July, 2016",all,🐧 crow,"Wow! Text adventure! This game has some good ideas but it also has some bad ideas. For example, it's not clear when the choices you make with your crew are doing anything good. Mostly it feels like you just make choices and they chime in with generic quips based on the traits they have, and choosing a specific crewman doesn't matter. I guess that's good for balance reasons since sometimes people will just die for no real reason you could have predicted? Also, sometimes the writer goes on for far too long, like a lot of people do who don't really have proper editors -- the robot play, for example, felt endless and had basically no meaningful input until the very end when you make the choice.Also, who the hell thought that font, in that color, on a black background was good? That person was WRONGStill, it is neat. I miss interactive fiction and I guess this is a way to make that more palatable to people who don't like to GET YE LAMP all the time... I don't know about replay value though which is a problem since some choices that seem inoccuous can wipe your entire mission instantly so you're gonna see repeats for sure. So I guess you should buy it, or maybe you shouldn't? This review is kind of terrible..."

It is based on the idea that you are an Ai that is tasked with protecting a small number of humans after the destruction of earth. I had a very good time with the game, but recommend that if you're looking into it, buy it on sale.Pros:- Interesting story with about four endings to be had.- Entertaining and descriptive writing, that makes you feel invested in the characters and thier story- Interesting character traits that factor into gameplay, often changing outcomes- Entertaining puzzles and mind gamesCons:- Very heavy reading (I would personally consider this a pro, but some don't)- Some choices seemed forced or very meaninglessthe hunger scenarios seemed very forced, you could almost always use a alternative with seemingly no negative action. I felt like I could use cryogenic sleep for the crew with no drawbacks, for example.- The space travel with the ship seems kind of meaningless and doesn't serve too much of a purpose- Crew can die a lot in the later difficultiesUltimately whether you enjoy this game or not is entirely dependant on whether you like an interactive novel style game. Personally I'd recommend playing on easy or normal, so crew doesn't die as much. The crew really does open up a lot of scenarios that may not happen if they weren't there. Overall, great game in my opinion."

You choose from amongst a list of crew each with their own set of skills and personality quirks and send them towards a series of planets, interacting with some self contained stories on each. Your decisions and the crew specifics point you towards different outcomes.Unfortunately, it's a shallow experience. You pretty much either end up getting some fuel, food, or both, and maybe a vague ship upgrade and occasionally an extra crew member. Sometimes some of your crew dies, but it mostly comes down to luck between which random option you select. There isn't much game here, and the text gets very drawn out. Given that it has to be flexible enough to handle random crew and visits to planets in random order, there isn't any sense of importance or permanance to it. It just ends up becoming a long delay before you learn whether you got some food or some fuel.I also had it crash on me some to the point that it screwed up my install and then had to disable my antivirus program temporarily in order to get it to reinstall properly.Again, it's neat in theory, and the pixel crew and soundtrack are a nice touch, but unless you're really into text heavy space exploration, I can't see why you'd want to spend time or $10 on this."

Pretty cool overall and worth picking up, although it is a little short. Some of the vignettes go into a surprising amount of depth and all are polished and well written."

,Recommended,426290,33390519,Posted: 8 July,all,sfsporic,"+ atmospheric+ well written+ interesting characters- repetitive gameplay when moving from planet to planet- game pretty much entirely occurs through text, which is alright but some more art would have been nice"
,Recommended,426290,29883300,Posted: 12 February,all,Allthegoodnamestaken,"tl:dr: The store page is very honest about what this is. I strongly recommend reading all of it, because the excerpt in particular is very honest about what a lot of this game is. If you're intrigued by that, you'll probably love this. If you're unsure, you probably won't.Your mileage with this one will depend entirely on whether text-only exploration in a choose your own adventure-style game is enough for you. The gameplay basically comes down to resource management and crew selection, but neither of these would be deep enough to sustain the game on their own. Look elsewhere if they're requirements for you.Steam's suggestions for The Away Team are, for once, pretty accurate. Its world building and depth of scenarios is comparable to 80 Days. The investigation of failed societies and focus on generation ships is similar to Analogue: A Hate Story. The branching paths have a lot in common with Sorcery and assorted Choice Of games, although in this case the stats and traits are associated with your crew members rather than yourself.I'm reluctant to say any more because the value of this game is really in the discovery. Suffice to say that you're looking at solid writing (albeit with noticeable typos), creative scenarios, and impressively detailed character personalities and interactions for what it is. You're not going to remember them in ten years, but they've got actual traits, motivations, and consistent behaviors, which is more than you can say for most redshirt analogues. Easy thumbs up."

I play about 20 mins and i am in love with it.  I just need to find the time to play it.  If you like quirky scifi text humor and interesting story and a cool world to explore buy it.
76561198056907421,Recommended,426290,28150510,"Posted: 2 December, 2016",all,serialzero,"This game is a marvelous piece of storytelling that kept me engaged to the very end.It's the future.  The Earth is permanently screwed.  You are the AI on one of the last cryo ships to leave the planet in search of a new home for the humans in your care.  Your decisions are what will ultimately decide their fate.The game plays like a Choose Your Own Adventure novel, and feels like you're directing your own episodes of Star Trek.  With each new planet you discover, you must weigh the risks of exploration.  Food and fuel are constantly being depleted, so will you push your away teams to dig deeper into alien territory and potentially stay ahead of the game, but risk losing some of them, or will you decide that the risk is too great, and potentially put them in danger of starving to death?  Will you judge situations with blind optimism, with fairness, with caution, or with an aggressive iron fist?In any case, your decisions will most certainly have consequences, but you must weather them in order to achieve the ultimate goal; finding your human crew a place to hang their hats.If heavy reading is not your thing, you probably won't enjoy this game very much.  However, if you like things that are intensely story-rich, then this should be right up your alley.  You'll be reading a lot of text, making choices, and deciding which crew to send where based on their strengths and weaknesses.  Some crewmembers are better in certain situations than others, so choose carefully.The stories were varied, from humorous to ominous, and it was easy to imagine most of what was going on in my head.  At the very end of my first run, I found myself smiling.  It was not only entertaining, but highly satisfying.A quality hidden gem, in my opinion, and most definitely deserving of a recommendation."

Loads of hidden sci fi references and an enjoyable cynicism to it. I especially enjoy the fatal endings; always reminding how even one stupid decision gets everyone killed.Somehow i think the game ended up reading me as much as i read it; as i was able to organize a planetary invasion as an ending XDEither way, with multiple endings definitely worth a sale price."
76561198005400484,Recommended,426290,29996805,Posted: 17 February,all,DoominaBottle,"See My Review Video Below:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBrl5AYzlDgThe Away Team is a interactive sci-fi adventure novel in which you are the AI pilot of Earth's last interstellar ship, tasked with finding a home for your crew.The gameplay is relatively simple in design, when beginning a new game you select a crew from a list of possible members each with their own set of careers, skills and personality which establishes your available team for the rest of the game.The game then moves into the space exploration and resource management, in many cases there is only a single planet to select from which appears random on the small area of space that is traversable, it is here that fuel and food come into play as the ship moves to a world or to the edge of the map to light speed travel. Both tick down slowly fuel from movement and food in real time to add a sense of urgancy, as the game does not reveal this fact it comes across as more of an annoyance.Once at a planet or station of interest the core mechanic of the game the away missions begin, from here you must select up to six people to send on a mission to investigate and search for resources, interacting with self contained stories on each world though in rare cases information gleamed on one world can aid choices on another.TLDW:Pros:Attractive visual and music, solid art design as a whole gives the game an retro science fiction atmosphere.Written encounters of a high quality containing very few typos or mistakes and a pleasure to read, can find yourself getting attached to certain crew members over time even if interaction with them is somewhat shallow to ensure that encounters are viable for whatever crew you select.Over 30 worlds and stations to explore resulting in over 700 choices.Game is friendly to modders and C++ programers with the developers now writing simple to understand how to guides.Developers interact with the community.Steam Cards and Achievements.Cons:Limited technical options for resolution and other related visuals (this may be seen as a plus by those wishing simple setup).Heavily text based which is off putting for some and the lack of art and relatively small text size can be hard on the eyes. In addition I was unable to scroll back to previous text though that may be an issue with just my own setup.Typical adventure game book problems regarding replayability, not all choices give alternative responses but instead tick internal flags within the program. This may cause players to think that a choice doesn't matter.Occasionally characters die to seeingly random bad luck or chance. Due to the unforgiving nature and chances of sudden death it makes a player less likely to experiement with alternative options.Rare moments of instability with crashes on Away missions.Only 4 endings that can be considered a ""Success"" in game, for example in one run where the crew were delivered safely but myself as the AI willingly self terminated my mission completed this was considered a failure.Final verdict: I have had quite a bit of fun with the game but it does feel a tad overpriced and I predict replayability issues, however if the community gets behind this then the possibility for additional stories and developments through writting and modding can add a great deal of further life to this well written adventureIf you like adventure game books and the concept then grab it in a bundle or on sale when you can.Edit: Removed Typos"

I give the game a 8/10. The mark-down is due only because it was really really really wordy (I do not recommend for light readers, the wordiness did give the game a more in-depth story and imagery though) and the fact that I had little will power to get another ending after I finished it the first time, I had tried a bit for an extra ending BUUUUUUUT after 1hr I gave up. I higly recommend ""The Away Team"" to any heavy reader and fellow sci-fi fans (I'm a sci-fi fan just not too much of a fanatic about them) out there."

As a kid, I thoroughly enjoyed choose your own adventure books. I was hoping to recapture some of the same enjoyment with The Away Team and hoped it would be good for killing short bursts of time.For me, I had difficulty with engrossing myself in the story. Ultimately, the success of the game hinges on the story and I just couldn't get into it. The text contained errors which occassionally broke immersion.   The universe seemed rather empty. Even when discovering a planet covered in city like structures, no beings were there upon landing. I didn't understand the reasoning for this.  If the story explained it, I missed it.On top of this, I encountered at least one glitch that seemed to eliminate what progress I had made on the planet.Ultimately, I don't have much desire to continue playing this to see if it gets better when I have so many other AAA and indie titles in my backlog."
