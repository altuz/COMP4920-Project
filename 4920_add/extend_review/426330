I don't want to give anything away about the story so I will start with an analogy, *not* an actual example. Imagine you are asked by a story to choose your favorite beverage - water, cola, or liquor. You answer water, only to be told you would have preferred liquor and now you are sad because you wanted to get buzzed. I am? I did?Again, trying not to give anything away about the game, but give an *actual* example of what I mean this time ... on my playthrough, the story severely broke down in the end. It was clear that the later elements of the story were written from the perspective of the character struggling against the crisis unfolding, even if your previous choices made it clear you did not view what was happening as a crisis. In other words, I had to choose the same option about six times in a row to get to the next page so the story could tell me how worried I was again, even though I had just chosen not to be worried. To paraphrase the responses ... ""It's terrible, you're distraught, you can't believe this happening. Now is the time to act!"" Why? I've told you six times I don't care. Next page please ... ""OK, but it's terrible, you're distraught, you can't believe this is happening."" I can't? I have repeatedly told you to let it happen. Please just get on with it! ""OK, but you view your special item as your one hope to stop this terrible, terrible thing!"" No, I don't - get on with it! ""OK, but ...""The result of this defect is that for me, this title wasn't really choose *your* own adventure, more like choose *someone else's* adventure and be told how they feel about it. Therefore, I can't recommend this game based on my experience. I think the reason I don't find this defect in non-text-based games that feature choice is that there is no inner monologue to contradict how you personally feel about the choices. Just something to keep in mind, in case you are thinking of purchasing the game, but would be disappointed by such a disconnect should you deviate from the author's perspective. On the other hand, if you happen to agree with the viewpoint of the author, you would never notice the defect and might really love the story."

Now doesn´t that sound just splendid?Sadly this has to be the first choose your own adventure ebooks, which really fell flat for me in some regards.The development of your own character skills is at nearly no point an important decision, the only thing that matters is research and the stats of the enterprise. While this may be realistic for a CEO, it is kinda dull and mainly influenced through the budget sessions.Also the romance part (which for this kind of game should normally offer some options) is a bit lackluster... i kind of got forced into the gay romance line, as he was the only one available.. which didnt matter much anyway in the end.Regarding the story, it also got somewhat over the top for me, when time travelling became an issue. That´s naturally a very personal taste, but that part just didn´t work out for me.To round it up, the end game also has some bugs into it, where people appear twice, while they should be actually dead already (mind you, that was also an important part of the ending judgement, so no small lapsus imo).So, while the writing is mostly ok the overall game just had me dissapointed, especially so, since the premise made me very interested in it.Conclusio: You surely can get more refined CYoA books by now, so if you´re no hardcore fan of the topic, you can skip this one.Rating: 5/10"

All I can say is that this offers a large number of choices in comparison, and these choices have real impact on what happens and what options you have later on. More than your average Telltale Game I would wager. You also have a lot of control over your companies strategy and which augments you develope for profit or your own use (and you WILL use them).Also, you can enter your own name to be referred to, and pick a gender INCLUDING options for ""It's complicated but I guess I'll put ___"" or ""I won't answer this question"". Nice touches.If there is one downside, I couldn't find a ""save"" or ""bookmark"" option, so I had to do it all in one sitting. I'm probably overlooking something really obvious but in case I'm not, something to keep in mind.Oh, and before I forget, the story is well written and memorable, with characters that I found interesting and believable in the world they're in. I caught myself sacrificing my own needs to protect them on occasion, and I was trying to be self-serving.9/10 would tamper with what makes us fundamentally human again."

You make major corporate decesions and choose what staff to hire and what kinds of tech to develop with the benefit that you can have any augmentations developed for free.  In the background is a mystery involving extra-dimensional beings and the disappearance of the former CEO, which escolates to involve no less than the fate of the world itself.Unfortunatley, without wishing to give any spoilers, there are, practically speaking, only two endings for this story, which is a divergence from the many combinations involved in this company's other works.  If you don't make choices that perfectly fit in the narrative of the two endings the writer wants the game actually has a time loop that dumps you back at the start of the story, convienently giving the player character amnesia so you can't have new decisions from foreknowledge, and tells you make all the same choices again, until you pick the ones we want you to.  This defeats the purpose of the story having any player agency whatsoever.  I was very disappointed and after my third time loop the shoehorned choices became very clear and I abandoned the game."

If you're the kind of person that cares whether a game accomodates non-binary gender pronouns and the like then you'll find they've taken every measure for sensitivity's sake.  The power fantasy of running, lets be honest here Massive Dynamics from Fringe, is great fun.The Bad:  Unlike most of their games there appears to be one path to win, or at least a narrower set of them than the usual.    At points it becomes less-than-realistic.  There is way more randomness than many Choice of Games entries with your resources which are what determines how much you can do and thus how much you can make.  So a bit of bad luck or one bad decision quickly snowballs into an unwinnable playthrough.The Bottom Line:  A great game, but not as superlatively awesome as others from this publisher.  The skill development system (which normally is a glorified decision tree system, if you've skilled up in a given area more than X times then you can sweet-talk the guard if not... he kicks your butt) is reused to provide more freeform options.  It's a shame that they never really go anywhere interesting with it because it boils down to ""have you checked enough boxes to win?""  Relies a bit much on guessing, the results of actions are not always logically connected to the input: a fatal flaw in a text-based game like this!  This is especially apparent in the first act.  Also, a lot of threads like the Romance options seem shoehorned in so they can say ""has X romances!"" on the promo blurb and have no bearing on gameplay in a significant way.  In one playthrough I was gay, in the next a lesbian, and the lesbian romance option was slightly more fleshed out (ooh, controversial!) because they went on vacation with me.  But beyond a few more scenes and a chance to♥♥♥♥♥♥off my partner by ignoring her wishes and engaging in corporate skulduggery she asked me not to, nothing of consequences was gained or loss.Buy this if you like:  Power fantasies, reading unique novels and genres, streamlined management sims"

But MetaHuman Inc got very interesting really quick. You become the CEO of a company that creates super powers or enhancements and are able to choose from a range of ways you will manafacture them. I wont go too far into the story, but its very entertaining to be incharge of a large company and becoming a millionare. The story can get a bit much and boring at times but is fairly addicting as you start to have more freedom.

Typically, I find stories with this format rather unappealing due to the vast scope of the world and its unnatural setting combined with a familiar story (magic/Aliens - CEO of corporation). Which typically make getting immersed in the story difficult because you are given such a narrow view with which to see what’s going on around you and with so much is going on its easy to get confused or hung up on certain details.However, that is not a problem with this game you very quickly learn its focus and what you are setting out to achieve which lets you focus on the intrigue of the main story and the satisfaction of seeing your metrics improve month on month make you feel like a real super powered CEO with plenty of scope to be the good guy philanthropist or the brutal cut throat businessman.I love that fact that you get to play a little allocation of resources game month on month as a method of establishing focus and showing the player the consequences of their actions and I hope to see more of this kind of mechanic in future games.Simply put I cannot recommend this game enough"

I had thought it was one of my favorites until replaying it after spending time in other CYOA games this week.  I found myself more critical afterwards.  The supporting cast are rather bland and making divergent choices didn't effect the plot as much as I would have liked.  I do like the resource allocation elements to the game and feel like it helped me feel invested in the success of the company itself and added to the sense that I was indeed the CEO and responsible for success and/or failure of my company.But I found myself unimpressed with the setting itself.  Choice of Deathless, Choice of Robots, Midsummer Night's Choice and Tin Star are examples of CoG products with a satisfying and immersive setting, whereas MetaHuman's ended up feeling very flat.  Nevertheless, I'm giving it a recommendation because I feel its positive features outweigh its flaws."

,Recommended,426330,22180235,"Posted: 1 April, 2016",all,Noelemahc,"Like all other Choice of Games games, this one gives you a non-linear story that will be shaped by your choices, for better or worse. This time out, you're thrust into the role of a CEO of a research company dabbling in making humans metahuman - sort of like superpower capitalism, except instead of being a superhero story, it is a cosmic horror story due to the price you have to pay for the research. Nice twist, that.Unfortunately, like some Choice of Games games, unless you choose a polarized approach and stick to it 95%, you're not getting a decent ending. This makes your first playthrough, the blind one, essentially poking at the game to see what major milestone mistakes you can make, and then prepare for a 'proper' run to see a specific storyline formed by taking a coherent approach.On the one side, it's a good thing, since this allows multiple reruns of the same game while seeing tons of new non-repeating content. On the other side, like in imperfect gamebooks, you can clearly see where the tracks cross, like ""here's a dialogue option I would have picked if I picked THAT dialogue option two chapters ago... what I'm more interested in, is why there isn't a follow-up to the option I DID pick?"".The game suffers a bit from what I like to call the ""Mass Effect Dialogue Issue"": sometimes, the options you are offered aren't 100% related to what your player character ultimately ends up doing, although it has a lot less issues with it than, say, Hero Project. It's also highly unclear at times whether a decision result is calculated based on your stats or RNGed, a traditional issue of Choice of Games games that messed up my enjoyment of Mecha Ace greatly.All in all, yes, it's a nice addition to the collection and a worthy recommendation to anyone, especially since the corporate backstabbing angle is weirdly complemented by the cosmic horror setting, but if you had doubts about these games before, this one will not change your opinion in the slightest.Also, if you don't mind me saying this, the ending feels somewhat rushed and disjointed due to the need to tell three outcomes as a singular story, since way more focus is given to what your shareholders think of you rather than what state you leave the world in or what your decisions or indecisions did to the various characters. Yes, this will make the next runthrough as a heartless embezzler easier to do, but also sort of undermines any intent to play a person with a stern moral compass, I'm afraid."

All of the titles from Choice of Games that I've played have been enjoyable, but Metahuman, Inc. is the best one, in my opinion.  It's much more open-ended than some of the others, with more endings, and it takes a few playthroughs before you really get to know all of the characters.  I really felt like the enhancements add a lot to the game, where your ability to run your research department efficiently and the order in which you develop enhancements opens up new options during conversations and conflicts, and therefore new branches in the story, as well.To address something I've seen others saying, I didn't experience much of a disconnect between my choices and the replies.  This one seems to be much, much better about it than at least one of the other titles I've played.  However, I'll admit that there are some endings I haven't pursued.

The author really makes each choice feel real and important and nothing is without consequence. If you like RPG's that show when the results of your decisions then this game is for you.

While I found the overall plot development less engaging than Choice of Robots (which is, by far, my favorite of these games atm), the people you interact with are written in a more evocative way than the relatively normal people you interact with in Choice of Robots.And you certainly can't pretend the plot isn't imaginative, even if it does use lots of tropes and some archetypes even."

If you value graphics over story or player decisions, this probably isn't the type of game for you.This is a pretty fantastic entry, which combines compelling storytelling with interesting mechanics and choice that seem to actually matter. I also enjoyed the game testing my own detective skills at a few points, challenging me to solve a mystery with the game only giving me helpful clues for correct choices instead of the direct answer like so many other games do, making it seem challenging without being unfair or obtuse. I felt genuinely immersed when playing this, which seems odd for a cyberpunk-fantasy choose-your-own-adventure, but it was just a very enjoyable experience that I felt a part of.My main criticism is that some of the decisions, especially the routine ones which you can adjust regularly throughout the game, should have to be confirmed before they are made permanent, as it is easy to make an error if you misclick or misread the option.I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good story or enjoys a game where the player's choices actually matter."

If they added a more lively taste to the game maybe this would be a good review but I just can't bring myself to keep clicking options of dialogue that just make me want to kill myself after a minute or two.I'll keep the game in my library to see if anything new comes along that might make it more interesting than it just being a survey to see if your as corrupt as the next guy or not, but I don't have high hopes."

Trying to explain the plot is so difficult because of the interwoven themes and genres that baffles me still about how well it works.Mechanically, I never felt once like my choices were just tossed off and without meaning, just a number that ultimately turns out the same. Every choice had weight. Some choices were difficult. Some were ultimately very satisfying. All were interesting.That is something -very- hard to pull off these days, but through masterful writing and an impactful story, they have made it real.All in all, this game is way more than what I had purchased it for. Not just for the fact that I'm probably going to restart the experience anew right after writing this, but for an experience unlike any story I've seen or heard of before. This is a rare gem, and I thank the creator for it graciously."

There were moments where I truly felt I was makeing a difficult choice. Some of the plot points were a little predictable, but I find that issue with many well written novels and is more of a personal issue with my insight with writing and story telling.I like the semi present setting for science fantasy, and MetaHuman Inc. does not disappoint. After starting my first story I could not bring myself to walk away from the story, and I can not wait to give it at least one more go and make some diffrent choices to see how things turn out diffrent.I will say that with no visuals or sound in this game you have to really like to read as this is truly a short book that allows you to make choices as to how the story will go, and in no way would I consider this a game unless you want to count manageing your own powers and the company's assets."

But if you know that that is what you are getting into, it can be quite satisfying for what it is.I takes about 6 hours to complete once (I took a nap with it on, so it says 9 hours). Though I have only played it once, the specificity of the ending and the huge variety of choices leads me to believe that there is a great replayability to this game. I love that it allows you to say one thing and mean another or say something and then when the time comes, make a different choice. That is very true to real life and I never felt like the game was making choices for me. I felt in control, and that is important in games like this. There was one plot hole that I found that ruined the immersion for meI chose to go back through the portal but could not close it behind me.
