Both are hard but fun time wasters and for their time, very ahead... I can't recommend it. There are two reasons to this.First, they didn't remaaster this or update it or HD it or whatever. You are paying for two emulated versions of the SNES games back in 97. If the want to revive these games and even the series, they will need to actually MAKE them and do something to make them hold up in today's market. Not just emulators. On Snes9x speifically. Which leads me to my second point...https://twitter.com/Lord_Nightmare/status/677599372788502528If this is to be believed, despite what they said, this isn't even legally using SNES9x. You are paying for literally nothing. If you want these, go ask Nintendo to put them on Virtual Console or something. At least you get the neat Wii U menus to go with it. And you know it will have been legitimately put there.As for any other reviews complaining its too hard and unfair, I managed up to level 7 in 20 minutes. Its not unfair, this is just how games were back in the 90s. If you wanted to win, you had to earn your victory. Don't let the difficulty deter you from a pretty solid gaming experience. Though I will admit it has its unfair parts in it.tl;dr: Do not buy this game. It is not worked on and you're better off with an actual emulator. Save your money where it actually counts and on a game the devs actually did something on. Me, I'm getting me a refund."

On the one hand, it is decently emulated, has enough features, and it's good to see Bubsy (at least the first game) available. On the other hand, it's a shame that the Super Bubsy PC version was not in some way used (which had better graphics and seemed to be slightly more polished), and the game really would have benefitted from some degee of rebalancingI'm still grateful for this release. Bubsy may have it's glaring flaws, but in my opinion, also has a some good and memorable points too, and despite some overall cheapness in difficulty (particularly due to one hit kills and the abundance of water), it's still worth checking out.."

,Recommended,426630,19771161,"Posted: 18 December, 2015",all,Mellow_Online1,"IntroductionAllow me to give a brief history lesson of this game and the character in question. Bubsy was intended to act as a mascot for the development studio Accolade during the early - the late 90s. This was an era in gaming when platforming games were all the range and when Mario and Sonic became some of the most iconic and recognizable video game characters of all time. Essentially, Accolade wanted to attempt to compete with both Sega and Nintendo's mascots, by introducing their anthropomorphic bobcat, Bubsy. Bubsy, however, was never really well received per se, not just as a character, but so were his games. While the first game did receive mainly positive reviews, all the games that followed received a dip in reception, but Bubsy would finally receive the notoriety levels that Accolade wanted when it came to Bubsy's more infamous outing ""Bubsy 3D"" which has been called by many as one of the worst games of all time. The character himself has struggled to have been resurrected after this title, that is until we got Bubsy Two-Fur.What occurred here is that a company called ""Retroism"", a company centered on gaining abandonware property, obtained the first two Bubsy games, ""Bubsy in Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind"" and ""Bubsy II"" and putting them together into ""Bubsy Two-Fur"" from Accolade, in an attempt to get interest back on the character once again. Retroism then stuck it onto Steam's Greenlight program and got onto Steam through community interest. And now, enough with the history lesson, what is the game like?GameplayThe gameplay in Bubsy Two-Fur is essentially what you would expect from your everyday 90s platformer, there are enemies to defeat along your paths as you try and reach the end goal of the level, along with boss battles every three levels, while you also collect balls of yarn. Now, while it is mostly your generic idea of a platformer, Bubsy does suffer from a few issues. Bubsy Two-Fur actually runs in an emulation, and as a result of this, the game runs in a fixed aspect ratio, 4:3, with the rest of your screen being filled with a dull red background sith ""Bubsy Two-Fur"" plastered all over it. As a result of this aspect ratio, and the speed at which Bubsy moves, it's hard to see if there are any oncoming enemies if you 're running at a fast pace, meaning running into them and then dying will be almost unavoidable.Another effect of this small aspect ratio is the gliding. Bubsy has a gliding ability in the game where after he has jumped, he can glide over obstacles. Usually, once you have jumped on an object, it's hard to notice where it is that Bubsy is going to land, this is particularly annoying in the platforming segments where you have to jump on platforms over water, where there may or may not be a platform underneath the one you're one that you need to use, which means leaps of faith are going to become a necessity at certain parts of the game..Another flaw of the gameplay is the hit detection. For the most part, it's alright, but there are several instances where it can make no sense. It tends to follow the usual manner where if you run into an enemy, they kill you and you have to jump on their head, however some of these jumps you have to be very precise on as you can try and jump on top of enemies, but instead go through them and lose one of your 9 lives, but there are also times where if an enemy is on a higher platform than you are and you have to jump on them to reach said platform, you just need to take a risk and jump into them, with a random chance of them dying or you.So in short, Bubsy Two-Fur's gameplay is essentially your average platformer that is let down in some areas. However, what I will say is that even though the flaws that Bubsy has just strike to me as forms of shoddy game design that make the game unnecessarily hard at time, I realise that this may also be a draw to some player that may appreciate an extra level of difficulty in their platformers, so take that information as you will, depending on what kind of player you are.One thing that I'll say that I do like about Bubsy Two-Fur that I tend not to see too frequently done in other platforming games is its attempts at non-linearity. The levels within Bubsy Two-Fur are pretty big and have a lot of secret areas in it which can lead to additional wool, lives, and power-ups, which means it rewards players for not just following the screen to the right, and exploring the level by themselves. I'm not saying this is something incredibly unique, but I'm saying that Bubsy seems to do this in a better way than other platformers do, which tends to be just hiding away 1 area with 1 secret item.StoryThe story of Bubsy is slightly different in both games:In Bubsy in Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind, the story is that an alien species known as Woolies have come to Earth to steal the world supply of yarn, and it's up to Bubsy to stop them.In Bubsy II, Bubsy has to travel through time and defeat penguins, sheep and whatever other weird animals that are thrown in there for no reason.Now, Bubsy in Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind has a good setup for the rest of the game and is solid. Bubsy II on the other hand, as I described earlier, has no setup at all, and it seems like it was just created as an excuse to get a bit more creative with everything else surrounding it. While I can respect Bubsy II going a bit more creative in terms of design, I still would have liked some form of setup created for it, as there is no form of motivation created in any way, and makes it feel like what it is you're doing is pointless.Graphics/SoundBoth of these Bubsy games have a sort of art style that still holds up to this day. The bright colorful art style in the first Bubsy game is pleasurable to look at and is overall good to look at.Like I mentioned earlier, for Bubsy II, they went a bit further on the creativity part of the design. While it doesn't have colourful art that the first Bubsy game had, the design has reached a form of creative effort that it's still good to look at as you're wondering what will show up next as everything Bubsy II is thrown out at random and you never know what you'll be expecting to see.As for sound, the first Bubsy game has a nice cheery soundtrack that goes along well with the rest of the game. Bubsy II on the other hand, has a weird soundtrack. It's hard to explain, it's a weird digitized sound playing that sounds like it doesn't really fit too well with the rest of the game. I wouldn't call it bad music, just not really fitting and representative of the rest of the game.Play Time/ReplayabilityAs for play time, Bubsy Two-Fur has 16 and 30 levels respectively for each of the games, each one, lasting around maybe 5 minutes each, but this varies as there is a different amount of content in each level and in each game, which means I'm willing to bet there's at least a good 7 hours worth of content here for platforming fans, and for those that want to try and get better scores in each of the levels, you will definitely get more time out of the game.Final RecommendationBubsy Two-Fur is definitely flawed in a lot of ways, particularly surrounding its gameplay, however, I can respect Bubsy Two-Fur has a lot going for it in terms of content and does have a lot of things that players can get enjoyment out of, especially at a cheap price.Pros+ Rewards exploration+ Good level design+ Good graphics+ Decent music+ Good play time+ Replayability factors+ ChallengingCons- Fixed aspect ratio- At times bad collision- Bubsy II feels at times incomplete- Sometimes the ""challenging"" aspects can lead to unfair territory on playersFinal verdict: 6/10My Steam Curator"

Not the best by any stretch of the imagination, but IMO not really deserving of the infamy it's gathered either The difficulty is cheap, no doubt about it, but if you can tolerate that kind of thing it's a good time killer.The emulation is definately a downside though. While I see why they didn't bundle it with the actual PC port, the emulator running the games makes ZSNES look like Higan. The audio can be downright awful at times, which is baffling since the SNES was renowned for it's sound capabilities."

,Not Recommended,426630,19813655,"Posted: 20 December, 2015",all,Gao Li,"Revised Review0/10 Bubsy Two-Fur Review – Or why you should be wary of nostalgiaI am a big fan of the very firstBubsygame. It is a game that I grew up with and was excited to play as soon as I saw its announcement on Valve’s Steam service during December of 2015 – a good year for any retro gamer with other old franchises, such asSuper 3-D Noah’s Ark(orig. 1995),Turok(orig. 1997), andMega Man Legacy Collection(2015, with games from 1985-1994) finding their way on to the popular online store as well. I was excited to write a review onBubsy Two-Fur, but even now I just can’t. Sadly, I was not prepared for how bad theBubsyrerelease on PC would turn out to be. So, instead, I’ll write about why you should avoid this release at all cost.About BubsyBefore talking about this particular release ofBubsy, it might help to know a thing or two about this series itself.Even thoughBubsyis the poster child of a bad video game franchise, the very first game in the series, just titledBubsy(1993), is a lot of fun. It is a jump’n’run platformer similar toSonic the Hedgehog(1991), in which stages have multiple pathways to encourage players to experiment around. Levels are also filled to the brim with checkpoints and 1-Ups to almost nullify any punishment for failing. Even more so, Bubsy the Bobcat has an impressively large amount ofLooney Tuneslike fail animations, quite uncommon for a game from that era, which, in a way, even reward players for running into enemies to see how he’ll react.Unfortunately forBubsy, the first game was a commercial success. So much so that the developer and publisher behind it, Accolade, pushed out a bunch of, let’s call them “adventurous” games of “courageous” quality that explored the limits of human tolerance.Bubsy-2came out a mere 12 months after the first one and looked like it cobbled assets from various other projects together to become a Frankenstein-esque monstrosity with a headache inducing soundtrack, the sequel after that,Bubsy in Fractured Furry Tales(1994), was more of the same but in bland, and could only be topped off by the final nail in the coffin of the franchise:Bubsy 3D(1996).Like many series in the 1990s,Bubsytried to jump from the second to the third dimension, and just like many others, it failed. Presumably due to financial pressure on Accolade’s side,Bubsy 3Dwas rushed out with not only horrid controls, a disorienting camera, and annoying sound design, no, its levels all look like unfinished test stages. Naturally, nobody wanted to play it and so, a few months after the game’s launch, the developer-publisher had to close its gates forever. The bobcat was then almost forgotten in the realms of obscurity had it not been for the advent of gaming channels on YouTube.Bubsy 3Dhad finally gained notoriety among the gaming community, just not for what one would like to be known for. During the early 2010s, it was renowned to be one of the worst 3D games in existence and retroactively one of the most miserable video game franchises in Western history, which brings us to the 2015 rerelease of the first two Bubsy games.The Steam Release ControversyAfter Accolade’s disappearance, another company, Retroism, acquired the rights to theBubsyIP. Since it was already a known franchise and because bad, old games, likeSuper 3-D Noah’s Ark(which became infamous after the AVGN’s Bible Games episode (2006)), had a successful launch on Steam in 2015, Retroism’s subsidiary, Tommo Inc., decided to hop on the retro train as well and hired Piko Interactive to use the SNES ROMs ofBubsyandBubsy-2for a Steam release titledBubsy Two-Fur(2015).For this project, Piko used the SNES9X emulator after they had the permission to do so by two of its developers, Gary Henderson and Jeremy Koot. Sadly, the emulator also used code by other people who refused to have their work be used commercially, which sparked a moderately big controversy afterBubsy Two-Fur’s release on Steam. Piko Interactive naturally apologized, but, to add crisis to a disaster, the second game in this bundle, Bubsy-2, didn’t even work and constantly crashed. Gamers overall were discontent, to say the least. The SNES9X emulator is freeware and if one had pirated the Bubsy games, one would have had a far superior experience over the official version.Both Retroism and Piko went silent after the debacle with Piko showing back up on the Bubsy radar in May 2016, five months after the game’s Steam launch and just before a first updated version using a new emulator was released (cf. Emulator Questions / Feedback, Steam Discussion Board, (2016, May 13th),http://steamcommunity.com/app/426630/discussions/0/487877107141475138/?ctp=4#c357286119106888164retrieved April 5th, 2017) After the update, the emulation forBubsy-2worked fine and both games even had Steam Overlay functionality, but now the controller support was missing. It was no use, as at this point, irreparable PR damage had killed Bubsy yet again and the sales numbers looked grim.After I had complained, a Piko representative apologized personally to me in the Steam Community hub for any inconveniences caused and the company offered to send me a Super Nintendo reproduction model as compensation for the trouble. I initially rejected the offer as that would have been too much trouble, yet they insisted. So, in May 2016, they told me to send them my contact details, which I did and they replied with an e-mail promising that they would sent me an SNES as compensation at some point in the future. (cf. Add achievments! [sic!], Steam Discussion Board, (2016 May, 17th),http://steamcommunity.com/app/426630/discussions/0/487877107137486019/?ctp=2retrieved April 5th, 2017) This was then followed by complete silence. It is now April 2017 and at this point, I do believe that it is unlikely for Piko Interactive to follow through on their word. They did, however, bring out a second update to the game in September 2016.Closing ThoughtsDespite being a big Bubsy fan who was initially filled with excitement for this rerelease and who hoped for new Bubsy adventures in the future,Bubsy Two-Furhas left nothing but a sour taste in my mouth. Nobody wants to play games that don’t work and nobody should. I don’t believe that the people behind this release put a bad product out on purpose, but the way things went was anything but nice. There’s a lot that could be said on this, but there’s no point to it. My only suggestion to others is to not fall into the same trap and to play games that are enjoyable.If you're interested in more reviews by me and other reviews like this, please feel free to follow my curation here on Steam:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/gaoscorner#curation"

An odd pick I'd say but it's happened, and they're here for those who want to try it.After having dabbled into it a bit, I can safely say that anyone who's had any sort of ""good"" history with the 2D Bubsy titles will be pleased to know that the Steam Release is pretty much on par with the originals in terms of overall emulation. I only noticed 1 or 2 minor hiccups but they're nothing that really breaks the quality of these ports. So if anyone has nostalgia for these games, I can definitely recommend this ""Two-Fur"" for those people.THAT BEING SAID, if you're fresh to this series at all then I'd say think hard about if you want to try it or not, and if so then proceed with caution. While these ports are faithful to the original games, said original games are filled to the brim with all sorts of Bad Gameplay & Level Design Decisions. Bubsy 1 in particular also has some very wonky momentum when Bubsy Jumps after running. And also be prepared to die, A LOT, from very cheap level design & enemy placement.You've been warned. ;)"

It was actually one of my favorite games to rent for my super nintendo. I enjoyed how cartoony it was and didn't mind dying a lot because I was probably around 6 years old and all the SNES games were difficult with many deaths plus this game had cool animated deaths that were different for every way of dying (so as a small child I cared less about how many extra lives I had and more about how funny bubsy looks with a captains hat) and the comic book in the instruction book was one of the things that first got me hooked on instruction books lol (plus all the trading cards except the last one feature art from that comic! nostalgiagasm!)I can definetly see how someone who was unfamiliar with the SNES era might find this game questionable at best but I can still make it to level 3 without dying and it's been almost 20 years since I last played this game. I find the key is to keep moving forward and care less about exploring, jump often (so that if where you are landing has an enemy you won't die) and enjoy the animated deaths.Also this is emulated very well for use with an Xbox360 controller. I try to play super mario all-stars on SNES9x and it just doesnt feel right. This I only had to get halfway through the first level before I knew it was perfect. Handles like a dream never miss judge my landings. (And I still own Super Mario World on SNES but only ever rented Bubsy so it wasn't familiarity that helped me).I have yet to try Bubsy II but if it has the same music I know I will be hooked lol definetly worth $2 for the entire Bubsy Saga.

The second game is a bit easier so modern gamers often look on it more favorably, but it isn't as good as the original in every other way. Either one will probably lack appeal to those who didn't play as a kid though: there are not only better games out there, but many worse games out there too. Bubsy 3D is the one that is remarkably and laughably bad.If only there were achievements so you could at least show off winning this game which is supposed to be so hard. (It's really not THAT hard. If you had a map of the levels, it'd actually be quite easy.)So why the bad review? This game received an update that killed controller support, and the devs won't respond to inquiries about it. I'm not going to use a keyboard, so it renders the game basically unplayable. Of course I can't get a refund now either.

The first game, ""Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind,"" sees you saving the world's yarn supply from a group of alien bandits, the ""Woolies."" The second game, simply titled ""Bubsy II,"" has you running through space and time.On the surface, it's a good way to bring attention to a long-lost character. This is despite him being rather infamous for his poor resemblances to Sonic the Hedgehog. Within, of course, it's a bit of a struggle. Gameplay is pretty straight forward, as Bubsy will jump about, run fast, and glide through the many levels. The level design hardly seems to benefit the bobcat, however.Further in, we note the legacy this particular rendition has. It was previously being attacked due to its use of an emulator to basically run two ROMs of the games. Where those results have gone, is a good question.My somewhat dated analysis of Bubsy Two-Fur, from its launch, can be viewedhere.The game appears to have had some consistent updates, so I suppose the developers are at least attempting to make sure it's up to snuff.My full verdictIf you want to experience one of the most infamous attempts to copy a popular system mascot, Bubsy will do just fine. If you have some history with Bubsy, this could either be the perfect purchase, or a plague to you. Personally, I can't recommend it to anyone looking for a worthwhile game, much less one that isn't simply inside an emulator the way it's been done."

The camera issue is not the end all solution but at least the game would be far more playable. Also, my copy of Bubsy 2 is jittery and the music pops in and out. That might just be me, though. The sad part about this whole thing is that if the new Bubsy game is cheap enough, I'll buy it. I come from a prestigous line of money wasting morons.There are several reasons to purchase this game: nostalgia, collector, massochist, sexually peeking furry. This is a game that could easily be passed up and you won't be missing anything. When you cross a finish line, you should feel accomplished not relieved. What could possiby go wrong? Five sloppy, cringe inducing games, one cancelled cartoon pilot that WILL drive you to drink, a steam re-release reminding us why this is a steaming pile, and a sequel over ten years later hoping to reclaim glory it never had.One final thing. When the new game comes out, please judge it critically. A subpar unwanted sequel can get accidental praise because you insist on comparing it to its predecessors. I can only be as optimistic as the facts allow and the history of this game speaks for itself. Don't expect a Bubsy miracle game; we'll be lucky if the game doesn't come packed with a computer virus.

It has all the special feels of a nostalgia trip. If you've not ever played Bubsy before though, prepare for some inherent frustrations, like touching an enemy and you die. Just about anything makes you die actually. Falling in water, falling from heights. Also the graphics aren't the best (but for me that's all just part of its charm as a childhood Nintendo favourite). The enemies are cute as. They're these little brown aliens that blow rasberries at you. Some kick cheese slices. Others throw eggs with their feet. There's a circus level with an ice cream enemy. But it's not really an enemy because you just freeze. There's also some honk honk cars, and a walking piano making banging key sounds. Then you have all the  yarn ball UFOs.The whole objective of Bubsy is just to get through the levels before the time runs out (really easy in the first few stages) and collect yarn balls, which make a cute little ""pop"" sound. Different coloured yarn balls make different sounds.I've had a few childhood dreams of gliding around like Bubsy over platforms. Also he can run pretty damn fast, just don't expect the level to become visible for the speed you're running, it can also be hard to predict what the hell is happening in the stage. A bit of a flaw of the game, still it's an amusing way to pass the time anyway. The later levels get a bit harder, but the game isn't very long. At least with the emulator you have the benefit of using the save slot function. You may as well use it because you'll be dying a lot and it'll help with any frustrations. ;)"

I had enjoyed all the unique animations Bubsy had for nearly any scenario, and he almost played like a Saturday Morning Cartoon character in the sense that he was very... animated, I guess is the word.As one who grew up playing Sonic and Mario games, you could easily see why I was drawn to Bubsy then.It's very important to not play the game expecting something exactly like Sonic or Mario. Bubsy is a platformer, but its not a series that is a carbon copy of the more well known ones. If you go in expecting a Sonic clone, then you'd be sadly mistaken. You simply cannot speed through these levels without consequence, and unlike other platformers, you only get one hit before you lose a life, so you need to take care and traverse the levels with caution if you want to proceed. There's traps of all kinds, and many of them are rather unexpected as you may find yourself back where you started, so it helps to remember where those are.If you just want a challenging time waster that's eeking with 90s era attitude and dated one liners, then this two game collection is a good choice for the price.

,Recommended,426630,21020618,"Posted: 7 February, 2016",all,Battlechili,"Honestly, I think Bubsy 1 is an all right game. Not amazing, but all right. The level design is built in such a way where each level has multiple ways to get from the beginning to the end, oftentimes with ways to avoid most enemies pretty easily (once you've found these alternate paths, that is. Some are hard to find). Its also pretty easy to speed through levels the way its made. You can find a lot of these alternate paths on accident just by running and jumping as fast as you can to get to the end of the level. You run at Sonic level speeds in this game, and I like that.The music is catchy, but you hear too much of the same music for too long. Bubsy himself is a fun character though, from the poses he makes to the pop culture quotes and puns he makes at the beginning of each level.People like to complain about the game having falling damage, but the thing is is that to avoid falling damage all you have to do is glide. And gliding is encouraged since it slows down how quickly you fall, allowing you to get farther while in the air, which is extremely useful when you're trying to fly over levels from higher points in them.Is it perfect? No. My biggest qualm with it is that getting touched kills you. Its unbelievably unforgiving, and considering  you don't have a whole  lot of screen to see enemies and obstacles as you move, this can be an issue. Thankfully, because this game runs in an emulator,  you have save states, so this helps alleviate said problems.As for Bubsy 2....Its terrible. It fixed Bubsy's biggest problem (the 1 touch death thing) since you can actually touch enemies in it without immediately dying, but the music and level design took a nosedive as a result."

I can't even play for a bit of time without crashing. I got it at 50% and the devs aren't asking for much but if you are going to port a classic game at least do it right and put some effort into it. Here is my experience for the short time I tried playing it.I had to re-map my controller each time I wanted to play for both 1 &2.I launc the first game die a few times but on my 3rd death game crashed. I had to restart so I did play a little more and it crashed on the second death.Switched to Busby two, no crashes so far played into the middle of hamlet, found the first bonus level played it and upon returning to the level I was in CRASH! but not just any kind, the sound crashed with the game. It was awful.THat brings another point, the game will hitch and hang when you play levels the music often stuttering my PC is able to run SNES games just fine so I don't see how the devs could ♥♥♥♥ this one up so much.Sadly I can't reccomend this and glad I boughht it at discounted price.

I really hope there is a revival of the series and a true Bubsy sequal that doesn't suck.  I've played all of the origianl Bubsy games and Claws Encounters is by far the best IMO.  Bubsy Two-Fur is a great emulation.  My only criticism is that they used the SNES version.  The SEGA versions had way better sound effects and I would love to see a mod that uses the SEGA sounds.  Overall this is a great emulation and I would recommend it to everyone.

,Recommended,426630,20652573,"Posted: 20 January, 2016",all,Al,"The first game feels like someone put together Mario and Sonic and made it suck. Everything that can possibly result in a bad 2D platformer is here: falling damage, awkward momentum, awkward level design, hazards that are always too sudden to avoid, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cat puns. It all coagulates into an experience that is really too difficult to enjoy. Prepare to abuse the save state system.The second game is a drastic improvement from the first, combining deeper gameplay and more variety with fair difficulty. Though Bubsy still runs too goddamn fast, the sequel at least tries to be an original platformer, and partially succeeds in that respect. It kind of feels like Gex. Thankfully, an update has stopped it from freezing, so now it's definitely worth checking out, especially if you've only played the first and want something better."
,Not Recommended,426630,20770989,"Posted: 26 January, 2016",all,Hexelf,"UPDATE:The game was finally patched so Bubsy 2 no longer constantly crashes but the update also completely broke controller  support for me. I used to be able to play the first game fine using either a PS3 or 360 controller, now none of them work even if I reinstall the game. Also, the function keys for quick loading do absolutely nothing.As it is, the first Bubsy is a classic and the eponymous character really does stand out as a great character design. The game however is poorly balanced, unfair and at times completely  unwieldy. It tries real hard to be like the classic Sonic games, but what you get is a Sonic-wannabe who dies from fall damage and running into walls too fast.There are some very cool ideas for stages and gimmicks, such as the multi-part desert/train stages and the black shirt power-up - but no matter how good they are, the assets are recycled ad-nauseum and get repetitive real fast.The sequel, Bubsy 2, fixes some of the problems from Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind - you no longer instantly die from taking any sort of hit and the enemy designs and stages are much better and much more varied with added gimmicks like shooter segments and mini games. You also have a choice in which order you want to tackle the stages which certainly makes the game less punishing in the long term. The game does suffer from inconsistent frame rates however can be really sluggish but I can't tell if it's due to poor emulation or if this was really what the original was like.Either way, it’s Bubsy and if you’re here looking to buy, then you’re probably either getting it out of pure nostalgia - in which case this review won’t matter - or you’re a glutton for punishment like me. But with all of the technical issues of this port, I can’t recommend it for either of those groups at this time. It’s one thing to be schooled by old-school Nintendo-hard games, and another thing entirely to get stuck trying to find workarounds for controls that are completely broken.Joy2Key does work but can be a pain to set up."

I find it a fun and challenging platformer, and the animations, especially death animations, are funny. Plus Bubsy is cute. :3That being said. I do have some negative points. Never a good thing I know.NO LIFE SYSTEMMario Bros. was challenging, but fair thanks to a life system, same for Sonic. But in Bubsy you don't get that. Everything kills you in one hit. This creates a strong sense of frustration that games shouldn't cause.TOO MANY DEATH TRAPSI know there are bound to be spikes, and pitfalls, but good god. They are all over the later levels. I can't take more than two steps with running into, or nearly running into some sort of death trap. Plus enemies are all over the place, and yep you die in one hit so that adds to the frustration.A nice save system included in the emulation is nice, but the game would still be fun if I didn't die in one hit making me constantly use the quick load function.I would certainly like to see Bubsy make a come back in some new games, and I hope you guys, Retroism, could provide that. And that is why I bought this to help support. It's only five dollars, not an arm and leg. :)"
