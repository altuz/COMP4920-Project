(Note: The religious themes in this game are not heavy handed, but actually enhance the story.) I would recommend this title to anyone, especially people who've lost loved ones and have ever felt the hopelessness involved.Truly a beautiful heart wrenching story."

You can get two of them for free and they are also included here.What I liked: this is not a harem/waifu kind of story, nor is it an epic struggle of succeding against impossible odds, it is more about facing the inevitable and what kind of effects that has on the affected people and those who surround them. I loved the writing and it got to me in a lot of moments. My favorite arc is still the himeko arc. Just be aware, those are all sad stories. The soundtrack is completely worth it and takes me back to those scenes every time.What I didn't like: Only females have any voice acting as far as I've noticed and the art is nothing special."

The new chapter is absolutely worth it! For everyone else a few more words:In this Anthology you get Narcissu 1 & 2 and a new chapter about Himeko, who is one of the main characters of Narcissu 2. Narcissu 1 & 2 are aviable for free on steam, so if you are interessted in this one, just try them out and you will know if this is something for you.The new chapter takes place near the end of Narcissu 2 and is shorter than the previous main storys. The Quality of this piece is just as high as the older parts. Nice drawings (but rare as always), atmospheric music and more than ever a really good and very sad story. It blends in perfectly, you wont notice a difference in storytelling to the other parts. There are some moments where the story will slap you in the face (in a ""good"" way). Even after, I dont know, several weeks or even months I get tingles down my spine if I think back at the story.So as I said, if you liked the previous titles, you will like this as well. Even if this story is relatively short compared to Narcissu 1 & 2, its still longer than a movie and compared to that, you get really good value."

I felt the top option [ Agilis ] was a translation that made sense most of the time, but was VERY unnatural to read!Sadly, Insani never did part 2 or Himeko Epilogue, so there is no option, but Agilis seems to have improved their work markedly since translating the first story.*NEW* -Review -It seems some viewers would like to more know about 'Himeko's Epilogue' and DLC which this 'Anthology' purchase gives you. So instead of just a tip on how to best enjoy Narcissu, I added a review to be more helpful. Here's a short version summery of my feelings on it and the other DLC, with as little story spoilage as possible.-Himeko's EpilogueMonths after playing, I recall 'Himeko's Epilogue' as a charming yet bittersweet experience. The story wasn't the gut-wrenching tragedy that was Part 1, as the author didn't get me as intimately attached to the protagonist character. I suppose 'Himeko's Epilogue' is a different flavor of story from Part 1; sad, yet relaxed, following Himeko's narrative faithfully, while adding snipets of history to beloved Setsumi's past. With Setsumi now far less involved, the supporting characters who were not prominent figures in Part 2, (and didn't seem like they would be very interesting), are back. I am pleased to say that they helped this final piece earn a recommend at $3.-A Little IrisI had the false impression, since all the stories are lumped together as DLC, that it would be similar in plot to Setsumi or Himeko's story. But to me it shares nothing in common with those stories. In this one there is much death, of the murderous kind.  The author constantly left me uncertain of the outcome, as the plot twists in 'A Little Iris' were very well designed.One downside to 'A Little Iris' is that it shares the same music as 'Ame No Marginal'. I couldn't accept that, so I just found some decent 'depressing/sad' piano music on youtube to repeat.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVP14syXWVYHellraiser's OST also fit parts of the story nicely."

Hours are still ticking.Learning to let go of certain things which are not so important while holding on to other things that are dear is truly hard. Whether parts of memories come from the past, present or future, it will all be cherished. Things are leaving one by one.There's a low possibility that one can actually let go of these emotional memories in days or weeks. It is just simply too hard.Dear friends, if anyone whom you know is gone forever on a fine day, do help by telling their new selves in the future that they did not have any regrets back then and did whatever they could previously to keep themselves alive.Thank you.I'm truly sorry.Yours Faithfully,Me.*Yuka's still babe. Would still cry with her :]."

Well Narcissu 1st and 2nd took that)The story so absolutely amazing as it stands tall proud with it's bigger and older brothers Narcissu 1st and 2nd, as a person that has only read the Himeko's Epilogue it is abolutely heartbreaking and rich with story and i've heard much greater things about the other stories. This is the visual novel that got me into reading, i've previously thought that this was just bunch of text and had low expectations of visual novels but the story is so immersive which makes me come back for it again.I could honestly go on and on for why you should purchase that (which is shame that it is paid content, but the developers do need to make a living). I'd recommend reading Narcissu 1st and 2nd first (Which is free, i mean you got nothing to lose) then consider purchasing this and the season pass/DLC storiesLove DLEnta258"
