,Not Recommended,426930,29372147,Posted: 20 January,all,JackMayol,"At this day, there has been more than 6 months without a single post by one of the devs, which is sad.The game has a strong core gameplay, the visuals are awesome but the game is clearly not done yet. The lack of updates and developer interaction tells me that the game has been abandoned. I can't recommend the game at this stage and especially in those cicumstances. Bummer!"
,Recommended,426930,21562915,"Posted: 1 March, 2016",all,stubar,"A multiplayer game where you control a tank in space and try to annihilate your friends?  On paper it sounds excellent and gladly in practise, it’s superb fun!https://youtu.be/qOKjFYV8LRUYour objective is to kill the guy inside your opponent’s tanks.  This is done by first destroying the tank and then trying to shoot the ejected pilot before he can land back on a planet and respawn a new tank.  There's a variety of ways to die which keeps things fresh e.g. tank fire, bombs, being rammed by a fast flying tank, being off screen too long, impact to a planet/sun, etc.There are a number of weapons at your disposal with more planned and it sounds like there may be possible load out choices in the future.Main things to consider currently is that the full early-access version is local multiplayer only, but the steam beta version which is easily accessible is online multiplayer.  This seems to be coming along really well and I've been playing games with friends with no problems at all.  I can't imagine it will be very long until online play is implemented into the full version.I had a previous concern about some of the weapons balancing and the developer has promptly addressed this issue.  Previously the siege mode a tank could turtle into was a bit overpowered meaning the game favoured the defensive player.  The developer has reduced some of the power of this mode and the game seems to now reward risk-taking again.  Great stuff!The game plays great with a controller and I believe they have designed the controls so that whether you play KB&M or controller there should be no distinct advantage.  So they've tried to balance things here too and apparently done a good job.The physics are nice in the game.  Firing some shots requires either a mix of luck and judgement to account for the gravity pulls from nearby planets.  It's quite possible to actually kill yourself (I do it quite often!) if flying around space too fast and bombs receive a strong gravitational pull from a large planet!Check out the video of the gameplay.  If this type of game is your type of thing I have no hesitation recommending buying it.  It's a very fair price and I'm very confident the game will only grow further during it's time in Early Access."

It's like combining Worms with the mechanics from Angry Birds in Space, and all of that in real time! Upgrades are awesome, and this game delivers. I'm pretty sure they are making more of them, but the ones they have right now provide enough fun to keep me going. I've been playing a ton of this. The bots are getting smarter, and online multiplayer is on the horizon. I've been giving a ton of feedback and the devs are incredibly accessible, but know that they have a vision for this game and they're going to see it through. The art is fantastic, the sounds are awesome, and the music is great. It's a great party game with a bunch of big moments that have you talking about it for days. Thanks for the great fun! I can't wait to see how this game grows."

The game advertises a ""matchmaking"" feature, but there is none. I talked one of my friends into trying it out during the free weekend and we had a lot of fun, but if we are limited to invite-only or playing against bots then I cannot recommend this game."

,Recommended,426930,28301672,"Posted: 10 December, 2016",all,macr0t0r,"Got this on a sale since my family was itching for a new couch-party game.  This one delivered better than expected.  It has the feel of ""In Space We Brawl"" but with ""Bad Piggies in Space"" physics.  The pilot eject mechanics is brilliantly funny.  It will handle mixed keyboard and multiple X-Box controllers without a hitch (a known issue in other games).  It's fast paced, but requires more than ""twitch"" skills to win.  It supports online play as well, but I haven't tried that yet.  About the only thing I hope for in the future is perhaps some power-ups that float by, thereby providing incentive to expose yourself.  Otherwise, this game is certainly one of the best couch-party bargains I've come across in the past couple years!"

,Not Recommended,426930,22642566,"Posted: 26 April, 2016",all,Ghojo,"Fun little game, with lovely (albeit limited) physical shooting mechanism and great looks, but I can't recommend it at the moment. Mainly because there's no ""real"" online multiplayer, you can only play with people locally or online with those in your friends list - no lobby and no self-hosted games.If you have 3 friends who want to play often, it could be fun, but for me I am too busy due to life/work, so I just want to jump into a match sometimes.Therefore I could just play a match against bots, which felt unsatisfying.Other problems imo:- controls feel a bit clunky sometimes, but are generally fine.- Not enough power ups & difference in weapons.- The automatic zoom is annoying and broken, manual zoom would be much better. Some user reported that he get's killed because the camera zoomed in and therefore he was out of the match area (which kills you after 3 sec).- No ability to rebind keys, set mouse-sensitivity etc.- Game menu controls are clunky.- No timer for your weapons, this is okay with the normal shot but when flying you want to know when you can shoot the carpet bomb to time your shot, which is important because of the gravity.- Only three maps, not enough variety in them. Could use more different scenery and interactive environmentals (like a black hole, nebula, shooting stars, ..?)- The sun mechanism is really cool, but feels unsatisfying graphic whise. It should look more fire like and less like a vector graphic.Other than that I have no complains, and I think if all this gets adressed, then this game could be a cool little multiplayer gem.Plus the team behind it seems to be very active in the discussion, which is a good sign.Edit: The developer said they are thinking about adding matchmaking. So keep an eye out for it and definitely check back later. Or buy it if you want to support the developers."

It's got many bugs, very little gameplay variation, no online support, and in general it just feels like it is way too early to be released for early access. It's too early and I hate that this has become a trend in PC gaming."

My friends seemed to be impressed by this game.The controls can be very dificult, but this is just due to their complexity. The movement feels strange, but your actions always feel rewarding. This is a hard game.We haven't noticed any glitches. And the game runs really well.I can't wait to see what else is to come."
,Recommended,426930,21028856,"Posted: 7 February, 2016",all,Jake Paul,"Moonshot is a classic game in the making! 'But what makes Moonshot so great?', you may be asking? Well that's probably why you are reading this review so let me lay down some factsPros:•Controller support, Online + Offline Multiplayer, and keyboard play is amazing! No controller needed.•Bots are intelligent, and have varying levels of such.•Siege mode is a buff, but is balanced for sure.•Great gameplay for new and experienced players.•Online multiplayer is in the works•Developers are some of the kindest people I've metCons:•Some power ups are OP, the laser is the most overpowering in my opinion.•In the online multiplayer, some features are disabled but this is to be expected. Very small issue!All in all, would I reccomend this game to anyone, whether it was a 75-year old granny or a seven year old child!Gameplay is great, mechanics are great. The pros drastically weigh out the cons!Happy Moonshotting!EDIT: Please one of the keywords on the storefront. EARLY ACCESS. This means that the game isn't perfect, but it's pretty darn close to it. Early Access means exactly what the name implies, the game is in it's toddler stages, and it's about to start kindergarten thanks to multiplayer. Multiplayer is one of the newest features, which should be noted since most negative reviews focus on it."
,Recommended,426930,21039199,"Posted: 7 February, 2016",all,Ted from Acountting,"Very fun, would recommend. If you are looking for a shooter with physics involved, this is the game for you! My only complaint is no online multiplayer, but they will be patching that in soon, as well as the fact that you can't edit gameplay options, like time limit of rounds, amount of powerups spawing (if you really like chaos), and the occasional glitch in placement of either you or of a projectile. Other than those few gripes, it is an enjoyable game."

It's a high energy, sessionable experience that's probably at it's best side by side on the couch.  It's still early, but it has a great foundation for replayability with more maps/gametypes/weapons.  The early beta multiplayer is pretty addictive even without all of the features integrated, and I'm really anxious to see what other cats in the community can come up with in public match making,Upside galore, even if it's a pretty limited play right now."
