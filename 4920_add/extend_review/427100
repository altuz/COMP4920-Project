76561197960319476,Not Recommended,427100,25129952,"Posted: 25 August, 2016",all,damien,"Still has a disproportionate amount of issues for a release. Should have been early access IMO.- AI is horrible. Drivers ignore traffic lights most of the time, slow down for no reason or keep going well under the speed limit even if the road is clear.- Traffic lights are not consistent. One intersection with two traffic lights, one for ""straight ahead"" (red) and the other ""straight ahead or right"" (green).- The left lane of the autobahn sometimes is marked off for 100m for no apparent reason. You can ignore it though.- Cars keep spawning and despawning in  your field-of-view.- Speed limits seem to change arbitrarily and don't always match the signs. Once there even was a 100kph sign about 100m in front of traffic lights. Good luck braking in time..- The sim tries to judge your driving behaviour, however it is difficult to understand sometimes what exactly the criteria are. All you get is usually ""steering misbehaviour"".- Traffic jams on highway on-ramps, even if the left lane is clear.- Controller setup is a bit finicky. I wanted to invert the vertical view axis. Instead of a button or checkbox to invert the axis you get to edit the input mapping curve. By default it's a linear function going from (0,0) to (1,1) AFAIR and you need to chagne the slope to -1 in order to invert it. So you need to adjust the sliders so it goes from (0,0) to (-1,-1).Also the sterring sensitivity was a bit high. You can edit the nonlinearity coefficient though. In my case setting it from 3 to 1.5 helped but it's not great.- Translation is a bit off sometimes, e.g. ""Could we make a break?"" seems to be literally translated from the german ""Pause machen"". The same trigger however also causes the more correct message ""You need to take a break"".In summary: The idea might be nice but in the end it's too buggy, runs poorly and is certainly not worth 30 euro. I've played early access alpha games of far superior quality than that.Addition: Some screenshots showcasing some problems.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=751603861http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=751603238http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=751602682http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=751603490http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=751603578"
,Not Recommended,427100,25424946,"Posted: 9 September, 2016",all,Dr. Strangelove,"I've thought of buying this game for quite a while and initially I chose not to, because of all the reviews. I bought it because it didn't seem so bad in one of the YouTuber's videos (although it is really odd that his ads are everywhere in the game - I don't think I've ever seen something like that before and it kind of makes you think. Go figure.).But now to pros and cons:PROS1. This game has quite some potential - the engine provides quite some room for expansion, and the topic is pretty interesting.2. The coaches are pretty nicely made.3. I had no trouble setting up the controls.4. Rain looks really great.5. The check-in system is really fun.6. FPS is stable on max settings, at least for me - no problems here with i7 Intel Processor and GTX 960M.CONS1. It feels like Early Access all the time.2. There are A LOT OF bugs - from grass on the streets, rain falling through briges, passengers thinking that you're off road when you're not etc. etc.3. AI Cars are AWFUL, and I really mean awful - they can even stop in the middle of a highway, causing accidents - with you or another AI car hitting them, they can't figure how to get out of a traffic jam and whenever something unexpected happens, they can't cope with it at all. It really breaks the game for me - I want to feel like a good driver and I constantly have to break the rules and do something really dangerous to avoid accident or simply to move forward.4. GPS that doesn't help you at all frequently - it is supposed to show you which lane to choose but it displays all of them, so that you have to rapidly change the lane on the highway, even 2 or 3 at once, causing a very dangerous situation.5. Passengers disappearing when boarding the bus, only to reappear inside - it breaks the immersion a lot.6. Sometimes I can't check the passengers in and have to restart the route.7. Passenger models aren't that great - still way better than OMSI 2, but not great.8. Fog in the rear mirrors - I constantly have this fog in the rear mirrors, which makes it impossible to see fast moving cars when changing lanes.9. Many graphic glitches - LoD problems and problems with displays inside the car - unless you zoom at least once, the temperature and speed displays are glitched. Also, at times, road signs are blurry.10. AI cars constantly disappear or suddenly appear in front of you, many times causing accidents.My verdict - while it is not that bad, it feels beta right now. I cannot recommend this game in its present state, although I do hope that they will fix it in the future. It certainly has potential, but I don't like it when paying customers are doing what beta-testers should be doing."

,Not Recommended,427100,25641978,"Posted: 22 September, 2016",all,-          k          -,"Despite so many negative reviews I also agreed with (according to gameplay videos) ,  I decided to buy this game after Update 1.3.9505 . So, this review will be based on that update.------------------------------------------------------After first few hours of gameplay, I kinda enjoyed, but as an arcade , still-buggy-af game; not as a simulator. This GAME is a disgrace of simulation genre in this state. I will explain the MOST IMPORTANT BUGS/ERRORS.MAJOR 1 - PHYSICS - SYSTEMS :No matter what graphics it has (No matter if Unreal Engine or OMSI-Like simpler graphics from early 2000s) , in order to call a game as a simulator, it DOES HAVE TO have realistic physics as priority. In Fernbus Simulator, it is exactly the opposite.There is no sense of weight, gravity, and effects of ground conditions (dry/wet/icy). You can accelerate at exact same rate when climbing %50 grade , and when descending it. Totally arcade, and this is the exact point where this GAME really spits on Simulation genre by carrying the ""Simulator"" title in its name.The acceleration and handling of bus is sub-par . Automatic gearbox simulation is severely arcade-ish.Even at cruising, it always upshifts at same high RPM (Remember from racing games) , and skips gears senselessly. Manual mode - 3rd/5th gear rolling mode does not work at all.Tilting of bus... Lol, I bet the scripters of this game have never ridden in a coach before. Realistic tilting setting makes the bus tilt like no tomorrow, and the actual real setting is called as ""Driving on rails"" . As a long-term commuter who had driven on coaches more than 1000 times in real, Driving on rails setting is the real one.MAJOR 2: OPTIMIZATIONHow can a game give less fps (loss by %50-60) in less-populated roads than major cities like Berlin?  I was getting like 35-40 fps on my i7-6700 and GTX960 in Berlin, then suddenly dropped down 10-15 in autobahn. Something really buggy here.Even at maximum settings, the game won't look as good as expected, solely on in-game settings. You may need to enhance it by Nvidia Inspector / AMD Control .MAJOR 3: AIAI is cancer of this game,literally.  They will keep stopping at green signal for no reason at all, even at autobahn junctions.  They will undertake you even on autobahn, crash into you carelessly, test 100-0 braking randomly, and block the junctions because they are too stupid to drive on the road properly; causing you to waste minutes / drive over pavement...--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------OVERALL: Do not buy this GAME ""at this state"". This GAME is still not finished, doesn't feel like SIMULATOR at all, and EXPENSIVE for what it offers. Maybe they will be fixed in short time, but if you look at TML Studio's previous games (World of Subways series, Bus Simulators) you should keep your hopes low, because they were still arcade and dissatisfactory after updates...  Wait for major sales to buy this for trial. Otherwise, wait for LOTUS Simulator by Marcel, and Euro Coach Simulator by SCS Software, which will make this GAME look pathetic."
,Not Recommended,427100,25129231,"Posted: 25 August, 2016",all,Chicken Ink,"I've been following this game for a few months now, mostly through YouTuber Squirrel and I was looking forward to the day of release, however I've been disappointed...The game itself is a fantastic concept, one I've wanted for a while, it's something that SCS have been planning on doing but haven't done it, so it caught my attention when I heard that TML was working on one. Initial thoughts upon booting the game, I had a black box for 30 seconds, not knowing if it had crashed or not, but then it booted into a menu which looks fit for a game from the 90's, or one created by a high school computing student, not one from a modern game dev. Trying to set up a Logitech G29 was fiddly and not straight forward, but I managed to get the hang of it based on previous experiences, although not something everyone would figger out. Also if you're not running the default resolution of 1024 x 768 or something similar, where the button is and where you click won't line up. I had to adjust my resolution to change controller configs and then revert it to 1920 x 1080.Now into the game, I run an i5 with 16GB RAM and a Nvidia 750Ti, (yes, not a super card, but runs ETS2 on ultra and GTA V on high at 50) so I thought I would try it on best settings with 100% resolution scale, just to see how it ran and oh how I was disappointed. Barely 15fps so I took them down to high and resolution scale of 90%, even then I barely managed over 24fps and the graphics were still very poor. Some might say I could run it on lower settings, but that's not the point, I would have to downscale the resolution to a point in which it looked like a game fit for an old PS1!So to conclude, I've been left disappointed, thinking this would run well. I'd go as far as saying that on my computer, OMSI 2 runs better at times and that's saying something!I would love to play this again, however, until it's been optimised and can run on high at a stable 30fps, I won't be recommending or re-buying."

No I wouldn't as currently it the game feels like it should be in early access game right now. I think the devs need to move the game to early access game and fix some of the major issues before claiming it being suitable to be a full release. I think the game could become big and be a masterpiece once the issues are resolved but at its current state it's not worth the £26.99. I have been looking forward to this game but this has disappointed me. I am getting a refund but will repurchase once the price comes down and when all these issues are resolved but for now it’s a negative review. This will change once I see big improvement in the price and quality of the game.Below is a list of issues that I have found (no particular order):- Some keys don't work correctly- Indicators can be buggy- AI are useless- Trying to figure out how to start a job is confusing (still never started a job only had access to free roam where you couldn't do anything)- Camera is extremely dodgy and you can't seem to auto centre it- If press tab to add the mirrors to the display instead of using the ones on the bus you get stuck in the tab view.- If in full screen mode the mouse curser and registration box are off (have to have your curser to the left of what you are trying to click).- If you put the game in window mode (fixes the issue above) and resize it as soon as you load or open a menu it resizes the window back to the small box before you resized it.- Their isn't a suitable tutorial, their needs to be like a training school where you learn all the advanced controls etc. and shows what everything does then the player should pick the difficulty such as simple, advanced or custom.- Better layout of the controls (Some buttons don't make sense) I know you can remap them but ideally they should have a good starting point. I had to remap all the buttons just to make it feel comfortable.- When creating a profile if you select your start/home location first it skips you being able to edit the profiles name (have to go back to main menu to edit it). This is just a bit of a pain.- Can’t move the seat or steering wheel (Feels uncomfortable)- Only two busesThis game has got some good points which you can find below however they don’t make up for the issues it has.- Good looks on weather systems- Ticket checking at the start of a journey (If I could actually start a route because of the bugs – Seen from YouTube)- Camera views for the dash controls- Bus Sounds when you open/close the window.-The added features inside the bus e.g. A/C sounds, Window, Sun Screen (You can do this but can’t move your seat or steering wheel??)"

This should be the most important reason for you to stay away from this abomination as far as you can.Review:Fernbus Simulator is at this point in time totally unplayable. It's unfinished, controls are not only user-unfriendly, they also don't work. Game doesn't recognize standard wheel set-ups and for the controller uses flight-stick controls that are so twitchy that even adjusting them doesn't help matters.They call this a 'simulator', but it is at best an arcade-game with a psychotic coach you have to drive through even more psychotic AI traffic.The game is a crapshoot that shouldn't have been released in it's current state. Don't buy this, as refunding is as user-unfriendly as this game is. Just save yourself the head-ache. Thank me later.Edit: refunded the game due to the apologist-army defending the game to the death. Not willing to lock horns with that segment of the 'gaming-community'."

The company sound so enthuiastic about this game and the format was very unique. I have waited for so long to write this review hoping that something would change with those massive updates. So far nothing is changed. That's why i am writing this review with less than 10 hours of playing. Because, there's nothing to play.- It is still terrible playing with keyboad, the steering is a disaster unless you have a wheeling kit.- Once you made a mistake, the bus goes crazy - no lights, no air conditioning etc. - and it only works again you re-enter your current game after a save. Sometimes it doesn't even work.- AI cars are really stupid. You have a great engine (Unreal) in windows and you are using it like MS-Dos. (Ferrari vs. Fiat). They can suddenly dissapear or come out from middle of nowhere.- Roads are generated automaticly, the same terrains, same mapping everywhere and it doesn't give any joy to the driver. I'm not sure how far they can go with those bugs either. It can even alert ""offroad"" when you are still in the lane.- Bus reflection is the same no matter you climb up or go down.I don't want to add more as it turns out to be a waste of time.PS: Mathias, please record someone else's voice next time.Please TML, give me some reason to play this or advice others. Gear up please. Otherwise, i am afraid your next bus simulation game will be out of consideration of buying."

It is painfully clear this game is completely unfinished and should either be listed as an early access game or pulled from Steam altogether until its completed. The devs have simply jumped the gun and the supportive community who have invested in the game day one have been completely let down.Firstly; the user interface looks something I would have designed at school in the mid 90's - it is an absolute embarrassment and this is made infuriating for users when trying to understand the very basics of the game as there is no tutorial in place. The controls are an utter shambles too, and instead of plugging in an alleged fully supported Xbox controller and playing right off the bat; you have to faff around the shambolic manual configuration menus. It was only until the game was released did the developers then drop the bombshell that this game has no full controller or wheel support at this time which is absolutely outrageous for a simulator.When and if you finally do get started; you'll find that there is no career mode or anything interesting to become engrossed in - just create a journey, do it and that's it. The AI is absolutely woeful and many other realism aspects need a lot more work to reflect the quality and detail of the cities and landscapes. This being the only redeeming feature of the game so far. You will only see the game in all its glory if you can actually apply the correct graphical settings as this is yet another broken aspect.This game also had a long beta phase but instead of the devs collecting critical technical and gameplay feedback from YouTuber's like Squirrel who were handed access on a plate; they instead just used the opportunity to freely advertise the game and the community have been left to deal with this catastrophic mess at release. The beta should have been issued to people who not only care about the development, but have a certain level of technical expertise whilst offering crucial input rather than ones that just want to make milk ad revenue from videos and offer nothing but free advertisement for the product.It's games like this that make me appreciate how well SCS Software have done with their Truck Simulator titles in terms of general polish and execution. I thought Fernbus would be a major competitor in the driving sim genre but this game is still stuck in the bus depot despite being 'fully released'. I also advise users to not waste too much time stuck in the menus fiddling as you will lapse over the two hour refund limit. If the developers fail to address the most basic of problems within the next few days; this is the unfortunate route I will have to take. When you buy a finished game; you expect it to be finished and Fernbus is still missing a string of fundamental features as well as the expected polish that a completed game delivers."

In the 8 months since, I've come back several times. In this time there are several core issues that remain that just ruin the game for me:~ Broken AI - I want to be able to get from A to B without the AI just stopping on the freeway (completely blocking my path).~ Lack of force feedback on wheels - If I had never played ETS2 I probably wouldn't care, but the lack of feedback feels completely immersion breaking.~ Traffic Signals - They're awful. If I'm sat in the center lane of traffic lights I should be able to view the signal (there's only 1 above) without going in to third person. There should be a second set of signals further away.~ Empty roads - Where are the cars? Cities feel like ghost towns. Which leads on to;~ FPS - It's awful.

And i love simulator games, so my expectation was very high.THE GRAPHIC QUALITY  6/10This area was the first disappointment i found in this game, although the game was released in 2016 but the graphic quality was way outdated even i set everyting at the maximum. I would say the graphic looked like an average game of 2010. But it's not very ugly. I could have overlooked it if other aspects were OK , but unfortunately, the other aspects of the game were not OK.THE AI VEHICLES 4/10This area was what made this game a joke. The AI vehicles in the traffic were spawned too close to the player, so close just a few meters in front of me , not just once, but many times. This was what killed the joy.THE PHYSICS 5/10The most important thing in a driving simulator game is the physics. This was also where this game failed.MY VERDICTBuy it if:It's your childhood dream to drive a bus. And you believe that the game developer team will continue to improve the game thrugh future patches.Buy it later ... if :You are not sure if the developer will be able to improve this game. Then you wait until you actually see some serious game patches.Don't buy it if :You are not serious about bus driving.

,Recommended,427100,33156991,Posted: 2 July,all,Gabriel,"The game is ok. It looks more like an early access then a full game but this is the problem with all german simulators. They never seem to be full releases.The game has two modes of play: Arcade and Realistic. In arcade you pretty much think only about driving while in realistic, you need to face a lot of other details like changing gears and passanger requests.The AI is quite dumb but this makes it more realistic becasue there are a lot of unexperienced drivers out there in real life too. Somehow, the driving feels more realistic then in ETS2 or ATS. Maybe it is because of the map scale which is bigger and the roads are longer. Also, it feels more alive because of the passengers comments on your driving when you are speeding or having accidents which makes it up for the lack of music during driving.You get to make your own routes and choose what bus stops to add similar to Bus Simulator 16, Probably this is the begining of implementing a sort of company management into the game. Hopefully the devs wont stop adding features to the game and atually make it feel like a full release and not as an early access.Like all other german games, this too suffers from optimization issues. If you can overlook the 20 FPS then you should buy the game it is neither worse or better then omsi, bus simulator, notruf 112 or cityconomy or train simulator regarding the graphic performance.Personally, I am dont mind the  low FPS, and I actually get  like 25-30 FPS on low-medium graphics on a lower spec PC then the recomended.A little tip for the people feeling nausea when driving in this game, remember you need to spend some time testing the game settings and graphic options. Remove the vehicle tilt, bloom, motion blur and post processing. Also set anti-alizing to low or medium. It shouldn't make you feel dizzy in this way.What I like about the game is that it offers the possiblility to select the year date in a calendar and drive the route in winter, spring, summer and autumn. You can also set the time of the day. The nice touch to this options is that you can set your own PC time and date automatically and so it is giving you the time of driving right when you are playing in real life.You are not earning any money in this game so you can do as many accidents and speeding tickets as you like. They are not affecting you negatively in any important way. The only thing you earn is experience and you unlock some things by gaining levels. i guess it is only 4 levels and you unlock things like Night driving and speed passenger check-ins.The Skylaner DLC is very good. At least it is the only way to get a new coach in the game. It looks nice and has different sound then the main game MAN'sRemember the game has no goal. You have to set up your own goals like unlocking all the towns or traveling all the roads or getting no fines or penalties in a cource or hunting the achievements."

FEEDBACK - Playing it with a controller[gamepad] is okay but when you are an owner of a (3rd party) steering wheel,you realize the limitations of this game. Still no actual feedback from the steering wheel, the ground feedback i.e. going over rough terrain etc is non-existent n thus reducing the immersion of the game. The physics is random. For A.I. vehicles : non-existent. A.I. vehicles still can be seen floating & spawning in infront of you as if a dream. & Now a new coach [don't forget you have to pay for it too]. Which would be okay if the core-gameplay was any better than when the game was released. Please TML Studio work towards the game rather than adding more vehicles. Maybe my expectations were high for the game but having been one of the initial owners & having spent $35 on this game - I do expect you to work towards the actual gameplay than the content. [No offense] Fernbus COACH Sim has a lot going for it. The graphics - Beauty - 1:10 Scale to explore Germany - they even have the city map's somewhat set up like their realistic counterparts. So yeah,the game has a lot of potential still. But if you don't work on your core-game & mostly invest time on addons & probably the new map., Things could be lot better for this game. Wish you luck & hope you get your game right by the end of this year. Otherwise TML Studios days are done for & as negative as this is it might just be the last of your first best work."

The list is endless and it seems to be getting longer. I last played the game fully in December 2016; all worked fine with minor sound issues. tried to play it today and the game wasn't responding to any back pedal input on my Xbox controller which makes the bus completely stationary, not to mention the sound issues still remain. rather than fix the game, TML seem to be breaking it more and more.I never thought I'd say this to a developer, but STOP developing patches that don't patch.I did love the game for a while at least, so that has to say something.

This simulator does a great job at being a coach sim. I know it is not fully as fluid as most people would have liked but it already makes great strides against OMSI for the fact I can get out of the bus and check in passengers. There is an overall sense of TML wanting to do the things you can't in OMSI or ETS/ATS.Performance wise, I have no idea why people are struggling so much with frame rates and gameplay.I'm running:i7 4770k overclocked to 4.2GTX 980 Ti FTW editionSamsung EVO 850 SSDLogitech G920That is the basis of what I am playing this game with and I stay between 42-58 fps. This is PC gaming ladies and gentlemen, that means you will have to adjust graphic settings due to what your actual system can handle and not think since you are a little over minimum you can play it on ultra. Even with something like a 1070 you may have to tone down, this game is a very heavy load and you have to be prepared for that.Overall I'm happy with the game and I know the issues that are there will be worked out by future patches, which to me makes a game this unique worth playing even if there is a slight headache sometimes. Was this a fully finished retail product? Not entirely, but it is 100% worth messsing with and getting set up right if it's something you truly want to play."

If Omsi 2 is one end of the spectrum and say ETS 2 is the other end, than Fernbus sits between them.Graphically its pretty good, they use the Unreal engine. I have noticed some flickering on occasion I can't get rid of with either in game settings or by setting my GPU to a non-overclocked base setup. The Audio is good, the sound of the bus is realistic and it changes if you open a door or a window, very nice. The passanger voices and the ambient sounds are also good.Problems come with the gameplay. The traffic AI is not horrible but will need work. I've seen cars spawn or despawn on the road, and there have been a few major pile ups on the road. To its credit, the game rapidly despawns vehicles involved in those events, I haven't had any accidents because of that.The game seems to have a problem with in game events. For example I've been told I'm off road when I'm sitting at a light. Also they need to tweak timing in the game. It seems that if I go the speed limit I'm chronically early. There is no way to reset the clock ala Omsi so you'd have to sit at the pick up point. If your ten, fifteen, or more minutes early thats just ridiculous. Also the passangers will complain about needing a break and there is nowhere to do that anywhere close. So they keep complaining until you drive into the oncoming lane. Well no but it gets annoying.I have a G27 steering wheel and the game had no problem recognizing it, though to set the steering sensitivity to anything nice you have to use the ""assistant"" that tells you to turn the wheel all the way left and right. If you want to not have to roll the wheel a lot you need to turn the wheel as far left or right as you want not what its capable of.I still like it though. I didn't go in with the expectation of perfection and the game is very playable. The cities are very detailed, not cut and paste urban areas either. It seems they've put effort into getting various German cities to have some realism. The traffic can be atrociously busy but you have the option to set how much you want from 0 to 100. I've found 35 is good.Its not Omsi 2 bittersweet and filled with flaws that make you work for your fun, but its also not at the ETS 2 near perfection level. You get detailed switches and knobs that work, a good driving experience and actual passangers to check in with tickets or smart phones. You can do multi city runs, have to keep up on fuel usage and the weather can be anything you want from sunny all the time to dynamically changing. You also have road events like re-routes and construction that can be set from 0 to 100.If you love driving games (not racing, you'll never go over 100KPH) this may be for you. Its rough, yes, but it works and Aerosoft seems to be working on it so it can only get better.  This, however brings me to my final complaint, the price. I think its a bit over priced for being not quite ready for prime time. Yes you get a tremendous amount of road to travel with interesting places to go, but ouch.System: i7 4790K, Gigabyte 980ti G1, 16 gigs Crucial Ballistix ram, Windows 10"

Some textures are really low detail.Sound is decent; nothing much that you can expect, beside engine noise and other effects.The bus drive decently, it is not a full sim; and matter not that the game support spring physics. There is some parallel wth how a big rig should drive, but you can tell that it is not a full simulation. Pushable controls are nice, although you need to get in a specific view to interact with them; so can't drive and push controls, unless you have them mapped to keyboard.The gameplay could be interesting if the AI of the cars would be decent; instead you get stuck in neverending jams because AI is so atrocious that does not find a way to avoid other cars or back up. This was OK 10 years ago, not today. Also you can run over red lights with no penalty. There is no damage to the bus to repair, so you can go offroad or on sidewalks, withouth any penalty.The progression in career mode is not affected by mistakes; you get few penalties on the xp, but it is usually 1-3 points per infraction, against hundreds of points you gain for reaching the stops. If you are late, no big deal, same if you run red light, speed cameras, hit other cars, drive like a maniac.The idea of getting out of the bus is nice, but all you do is to check ONE BY ONE the passengers, and either they have the right ticket, wrong ticket or no ticket at all; they interaction is close to 0, and simply disappear; like Train simulator,  instead than hopping on the bus. Beside fueling and check tickets, there is no other gameplay for the first person part; nice to add it but if there is nothing to do with it...And in one year that this game has been released, some serious bugs are still there since launch; the devs seems interested in DLC and new games, instead than fixing this, so it is disappointing to see such behavior, when some serious issues still persist.I can't suggest this game, until bugs are fixed and AI improved radically, The only nice thing is the bus, with clickable elements, but if the rest of the game is sub par, there is no incentive in playing it."

There are some bugs, but the team is working to clear them, and hands out patches regularly.Pros:-awesome graphics (the lights are the best!)-detailed simulation (of the bus, and other tasks of the driver)-you can walk through and around your bus-realistic passengers (complaining literally for everything, just like in real life, so now it is not a bug, it's a feature)-lovely cities (including some famous local sights, and many unique bus stations)-you can plan your routes just like you want them-good control settings (you can customize your controls very easily, much better than in other simulators)-dynamic weather: pretty, but changes weather types a bit often-dynamic events (not really appears for me, only the police stops, but I have spent only 15 hours in the game, and discovered just a small part of Germany)-catchy soundtracksCons:-AI is not the best, if you have a dense traffic setting, you can encounter some never ending traffic jams, but if you set it to low, there will be only a few cars on the roads-a bit hard to follow the navigation: it shows precisely the lanes you need to follow, but don't give enough time to you to notice the next junction or exit-career mode is really short: it would be great if you can start your own coaching company where you can manage every stuff (there are many contractors for Flixbus in real life as well)-only two buses (hopefully there will be more later, or at least some great mods)All in all the game is great, and hopefully the developpers will keep updating it. It is a simulator, where everything should work like in real life, which makes it inevitable to have some bugs or missing features in the beginning, but I believe that with the feedbacks and the continous work, it can be absolutely awesome."

They tend to hit the breaks hard when going off the highway. At times they drive very slow on the highway, putting themselves in the way of you, when you are trying to enter. Will likely get fixed. The problem reported about AI cars driving through red lights seem fixed. Have not seen that happen. Also noticed it's common to get traffic jams when exiting the bus depot, there will already be a massive line outside when the gates open.Edit: After a few patches some of AI issues were supposed to have been fixed. But I've still noticed they tend to drive too slow and there are still massive traffic jams when you exit the depot. I actually think the traffic lights are broken/bugged and is the problem.2) The GPS! The GPS is terrible quite frankly. Unless I'm missing something, you can't zoom out/in, which makes it hard to know what is coming up, unless you pull up the entire map and zoom in fully. It also draws up multiple lines telling you where to drive. Which makes it all the more confusing when you eventually need to turn and see two lines and only when you reach said turn you will notice it on the GPS. Chances are high you are in the wrong lane now.Edit: The GPS is better after patching. More clear to see where to go, but I still wish for a zoom function.Apart from that I'm having fun playing this right now. Graphics are good, the handling of the bus seems very realistic. I haven't noticed too much problems with the performance so far. I certainly don't have a great PC but it's been running pretty smoothly for me. Might not have the best fps but it's perfectly playable and only noticed some microlag or tiny stuttering 2-3 times.All in all, I'm quite happy with this game and hope to see it get better and get more stuff in the near future."

I've amassed nearly 30 hours in this game now so I wanted to give a balanced review.Overall I really enjoy this game. If you like driving simulators like Euro Truck/American Truck Simulator then you'll love this game. The map is expansive and you really can get lost into the driving for hours. The cities are large and feel very realisic. I really enjoy getting out of the bus to check in the passengers and think that this adds to the immersion of the experience.XBOX controllers do work (partially). You can drive and operate most of the ancillary controls but you still have to use keyboard and mouse for check in and working the wipers.There are no pre-set routes in the game but the official Flixbus website is really useful to find real routes that you can drive.The game is not without flaws though. Hopefully some of these will get worked out with time. Optimization needs to be improved. The game is beautiful to look at but even on low settings sometimes runs with low FPS.AI - this definitely needs improvement. Cars will stop randomly on the Autobahn or slow down to 30km/h in the fast lane. Cars don't merge properly at lane drops or slip roads. Cars will sit for ages at green lights and then move just when the light is about to go red (very annoying), despawn or sit and block up the middle of junctions. Maybe, like in OMSI, the devs could add an option to disable AI collisions until the AI has become more accurate?I would recommend the game because in spite of all these things I still find it an enjoyable game to play."

You wouldn't get offended if games from Valusoft had bugs however today if it's not branded as Early Access or Indie people will directly switch to hating because they were expecting Fernbus to be on the same level as GTAV.Regardless of the bugs and AI issues I still have fun with this game and thanks to today's gaming industry it's actually possible for the team to polish and fix the game and even add new features and all of that even if it's not branded as Early Access.TL/DR: If you liked OMSI then Fernbus is a good game.

The game simply doesn't play well with it, as the sensitivity is way too high. You'll be forced to play with a keyboard and mouse instead, which is just awful with confusing controls and terrible mouse acceleration. Your passengers will constantly complain about you steering too sharply.The game ran ""okay (40-50 fps on an R9 Fury and and i5 6600k)"" on pretty much everything ultra except medium anti aliasing and high draw distance, but it didn't look all that good, okay the shadows and lighting are pretty nice, but the game just generally has a blurry, grainy look to it. Furthermore, the buildings and foliage look a bit generic and the map doesn't seem too accurate.I also found it incredibly frustrating to constantly wait on traffic lights in the city, I've been through only one city yet (Köln), but I immediately felt annoyed by the long waiting times and the very short amount of time the light actually was green.All in all, not really the best experience and I recommend everyone to wait buying this game until they have patched these issues (if they ever will) or the game is on sale."

,Recommended,427100,25173082,"Posted: 26 August, 2016",all,Bay Area Native,"When I look at the negative reviews this game has received on Steam, either people have a problem starting the game, or they have played it no more than an hour before writing a negative review about this game. Very few of the negative reviews on this have been justifiably written, so I thought I should write my honest opinion of Fernbus Coach Simulator.The Bus:This game comes with two buses: the MAN Lions Coach and the Lions Coach C, which is slightly larger. Every little bit of the bus is detailed to real life; everything is clickable in the cockpit area, a bit like OMSI. What I hear quite a bit is that the tilt of the bus, when on the realistic setting, is anything but realistic. To anyone who thinks this - the developers asked real bus drivers to test the game and programmed the bus accordingly. Same goes for the engine - the devs recorded the noise of the bus from multiple locations and put it into the game. I've seen so many people complaining about the engine noise, when in fact it's quite realistic. Both buses, in my opinion, look and sound great. Definitely a highlight of this game.The Map: TML Studios has really created something special with this game's world. Everything is very detailed (ex: random buildings next to autobahns, and tiny objects at building locations) and each city has character. You can tell the developers put their heart and soul into this map.Graphics: When put on high or max, this game's graphics put SCS Software to shame. On low settings, this game looks comparable to OMSI or worse. It depends on what PC you have, but this game is pretty graphically demanding.AI Traffic: AI traffic needs quite a bit of work. It's not terrible - cars stop behind you when you slow down, and they stop at traffic lights, but they really don't behave properly in many situations. When cars are stopped at traffic lights, they tend to jitter forward for a few seconds. It doesn't matter if you turn on your signal; cars will completely ignore your request as a bus driver. That being said, I haven't experienced any unfair crashes due to the AI crashing into me. So in conclusion, the AI needs work, but it's tolerable.Passengers: The passengers actually look really nice in this game. They all look different and have individual names, and behave reasonably. This game also has, by far, the best check-in system of any simulator. Each person either has an online ticket, a paper ticket, or will ask you to buy a ticket on the spot. All of this occurs in real life, and it just feels great to check people in.If you love buses (and Germany), this game is for you. If you want a simple game that you can jump into and play and enjoy, then you're probably going to find this game and difficult and painful to play. It's quite a complicated experience, and the tutorial doesn't tell you much. It takes a while to figure out how to operate the bus properly; it's not a very intuitive experience.That being said, I believe this game is a great experience Maybe in a year or so, it will be an amazing game, with future patches, DLC and mod support coming soon. But for now, I'm perfectly fine playing what I have been given on August 25th.UPDATE: Ok, this game has been out for almost a year now, and I still stand by everything i said above. However, the game has changed quite a lot since its release, and it's got two DLC packs as well, so here's a quick overview of what's changed and what's been improved:- Better AI: The AI traffic has been updated several times since release, and now behaves much more reasonably than it did before. Vehicles no longer jitter forward upon stopping at a light; cars also generally go when the light is green now (they would frequently sit there and despawn before, which was quite irritating). In addition, there are more vehicles added now, including European heavy-haul trucks you see in ETS 2, as well as Flixbus AI vehicles on the road as well. You can also find buses at most depots now, which makes the bus stations feel a bit more alive and realistic.- Better UI/Menus: The game's user interface has been completely remodeled from when it released, and is miles better than what it once was. Upon loading the game, you are treated to some nice pictures of in-game scenery, as well as some music playing in the background (some of the music really doesn't belong in a bus simulator). The Sat Nav on the bottom right corner has had information added to it, including your speed and the speed limit. The map will also zoom in and out, depending on the speed of your coach, to give you a better view of what's ahead, and you can adjust its zoom to show you more or less of the road.- Better Performance: I never experienced any crashes when the game first came out, but the developers have nevertheless consistently improved the performance of this game, and it runs better now than it did before. It's still a graphically demanding game, and there are still peculiar parts of the map where the framerate will drop to abysmal levels, but overall the performance is pretty good.- Better Sound/Effects: The motor noise of the MAN coaches has also been changed since the game came out, as well as tire noise effects to give you a sense that you're going fast. Sounds when traveling across a bridge or through a tunnel have been altered as well. There haven't been too many changes to the game's overall sound quality, but the changes that have been made are favorable.These are by no means the only changes the developers have made to the game, but those are the ones that stick out in my mind the most. That's not to say this game is perfect, rather it is far from it. Pedestrians are still not roaming the cities. I didn't mention this in my original review, because the devs stated they would be putting pedestrians into the game eventually, but it's been nearly a year and there's still no sign of them. Passengers still don't walk onto the bus either, rather they teleport into the coach, and I've been waiting for them to fix this for quite a while now. Force feedback has not been implemented as well, although I do not use force feedback myself and, therefore, I am not raging like I've seen others do because of a lack of force feedback.The AI and the performance could always be further improved, and I expect TML to continue to work on this game for the foreseeable future. Weekly and monthly updates and hotfixes still regularly come out, and it's comforting to know the people over at TML-Studios haven't abandoned this game like they have with others. There's a passion to make this game better than it is now, and I can appreciate that. I'm going to continue playing this game myself, and I still recommend it to any simulator fan out there."

I'm not too sure how the reviews are so bad right now because still the graphics are amazing and performance is great. I'd say it's slightly better to run then ETS2/ATS which I wasn't expecting.

That was the case with the prison architect, the space engineers and a number of other titles. Here however, this is sadly not the case.From the convoluted interface to the zombies on the bus stops to the lackluster physics, this IS still a decent attempt at a game. An attempt, no more. Another ten years of education for the development team and we just might have had a game. This product is certainly not a game.As King Arthur said in one famous movie, ""You make me sad"". This is precisely the feeling I got from playing this. I always have high hopes for German releases (my father is German, I know well the punctuality and commitment to precision and quality that they usually display) but this time I really feel let down. Remember OMSI? Now, that IS how you do things the German way - a bit bland, but polished to the very extreme. This thing... it does not show a single hint of a promise there.A gtreat premice, and a very amateurish execution.

The game has potential, however it was released to early, it has good graphics, the check in system is pretty nice too, as well as the fact that flixbus is actually working with the devs to get more features put in, the busses are modeled quite well, with detailed interiors and most buttons working, the map is huge and well detailed, although i must say you do see alot of repeated assets, one town can look very similar to another miles away, now im getting to why i refunded the game for now (ill buy it agian if they work out the bugs but i didnt want to be stuck with abandonedware if they didnt) the controls on an xbox 360 controller are pretty bad, at least i think, its such a pain and so tedious to set up, i may not have been doing it right (it may be worth mentioning that they are working on getting good profiles for several types of controllers, according to the forums) the steering was way to twitchy, it seemed to think my analog stick was a steering wheel, thus the steering wheel would rotate the full 2 1/2 times in the distance the analog stick moved, needless to say it was incredibly sensitive and twitchy. the optimization isnt the best but not the worst, i didnt have a hard time running the game on high though i did notice it wasnt running at 60 frames, but stayed more around 25-35, this normally isnt to big of a deal to me except when its a driving sim, because when it doesnt run well, you get delay and arent able to react to events as you normally would. the game also only has 2 busses, and ones pretty much just a stretched version of the other, not a big deal to me, they do have very nice interiors, and im one for realism, and realistically a bus driver wouldnt be in a new bus every trip but i could see why youd want to, overall id say wait until they at least prove they are going to fix the bugs, they seemed pretty good at it before release but its not to late to be abandoned, im personally waiting for decent controls (more like ets 2/ ats) and improved optimization."

I get penalized for having a ""light accident"".But, despite everything; I love you Fernbus Simulator <3(Needs work, but still playable and worth purchasing imo)TML pls don't penalize for going ""too slowly"", and don't blame us poor coach drivers when some bellend crashes into us xoxo"

One of those problems is the price tag for a start, for what you get in the game (which at the moment isn't a lot! and comes across as very unfinished) the price tag of £26 seems rather steep.After 3 hours of gameplay, I have to admit, I did enjoy driving around. I think my favourite feature had to be the system of picking up the passengers. The AI drivers are ridiculous, there were times I had cars braking every other minute which caused a few 'light crashes' as the game describes them. The major problem I had was the steering, it is unbelievably horrible to the point where I was sick of getting penalties for it. There is no option to turn controller/wheel sensitivity down. Only an option to sort out the tilt of the bus. I could point out other flaws with the game, but I might end up writing an essay.Overall, the game has potential if the Devs actually do listen to their customers. At some point, I'd like to see more content like buses and maybe some sort of career mode because why is there an XP system if we can't have some sort of career mode? It's not bad, but it's not great either. If you're willing to spend £26 and have some issues but are willing to look past them for now, give the game a try! If not, stick to other bus simulators like OMSI or Bus Simulator 16."

It shows the potential to become an incredibly good game but at the moment it disappoints if you load up expecting a polished and finished product. I would recommend purchasing it, but expect a bit of a wait for the game to evolve into the product we all hope for.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PROS:- It's a game that's been wanted for a long time now and has finally become a reality- The level of detail is impressive- The Graphics are also reasonably good although some work could be done on the quality of the AI/passengers- Is now keeping me excited for when the game is finished.CONS:- Is by no means a finished product- Graphics engine is nowhere near optimised. My computer can run most games (such as ETS/ATS, World of Tanks) at max graphics comfortably at 60+ FPS. With this game it struggles to run minimum graphics at 20. At the moment, a very strong computer is required.- Controls are clunky and difficult. Most notable is the lack of mouse control. Interestingly, mouse axis have been included in the settings, however the game simply doesn't detect anything when trying to set it up. Definitly something that needs to be looked at in the future. Unless you have a wheel, or are very good at keyboard controls, dont expect smooth driving!"

Feels as though its rushed for release. Spent an hour trying to set up G27 accelerator and brake but game wasn't having any of it, pedals do the opposite to what they are supposed to. In the end set brake to accelerate and vice versa and it sort of works. I left the tutorial on thinking it would tell me what to do, that was wishful thinking, it's about as much use as a chocolate teapot. I just managed to start driving the bus, the screen went black for about 5 seconds and when it came back all the settings had reverted to default, and there was no way out except Ctrl-Alt-Del. Not recommended at the moment, they need some patches quick or I will be asking for a refund.edit:Ok after giving it a bit longer it hasn't crashed on me again in 4 hours. However it has shown more problems.The graphics are poor for the unreal engine, you can't read road signs until you are literally on top of them! come on devs, ETS2 has better graphics and it's over 4 years old.AI is atrocious, they spawn directly in front of you, cut you up, ignore red lights, drive at 30kph on the autobahn, which causes you to crash into them, which then causes them to ping 100m into the air lol.You don't get any penalties for driving through red lights, you can basically ignore them.Speed limits on nav don't tie in with road signs, i've had it show 50kph on the autobahn and 100kph in city centres.When it rains I don't appear to get rain on windscreen although I have seen them on youtube videos?It rains under bridges.No TrackIR support.The good:Thanks Mathias for giving details on steering wheel setup, now working OK but why was it such a faff in the first place. Every other game I own recognised my wheel and worked out of the box?Passenger checkin works well.Love the different seasons.Weather effects on road surfaces very good.I really want to love this game so am going to stick with it and wait for updates. None of the faults are game breaking so with fixes it has the ability to become a good game. Still wouldn't recommend in it's current state but will update review after fixes.2nd editOk after the update they appear to have fixed the AI going through traffic lights, speed limits, rain on windshield and a few others. I have now played for 20 hours and am really enjoying it. If you look past the other bugs, none of them game-breaking, it is a thoroughly enjoying sim.

Random things happen around the map, such as police checks, accidents, roadworks.The one real negative mark in my eyes is lack of force feedback. Driving the bus is still suprisingly realistic, also the devs are working on this. I agree, they rushed the release, but we all know they still working on it.

This game is buggy and as soon as you get on the highway you are stoped by police until you quit. Also the controls are way to spread out from eachother so your looking at the keyboard while driving and you crash and when you try to adjust the controls you constantly run into issues where you set a key to control something like exiting your seat and the engine turns off and that is a constant struggle for all key bindings.

I'll list the good and the bad, all my own opinion.Good:The physics, the air suspension and physics in general feel very pleasing. Not too far from that of the ETS2 physics mods but does need work.The graphics, being on the Unreal Engine you know what to expect. The glisten of the rain on the bus, along with the water droplets and the fog with the early morning sunrise gleaming down onto the bus through trees allows for a pleasent viewing experience.The map, very large map, with around 20,000KM if I remember right, plenty to explore so you will not tire quickly of the routes being taken.Bad:The AI, sometimes unpredictable, they can stop in the middle of the junction without notice and you can be a sitting duck at the lights not knowing what tod. Other times they are fien albeit a slight ""judder"" in their movement.Stuttering/FPS I've had a few frame drops and general stutter here and there but with a newly released game it cannot be perfect but in my eyes it is playable.Controls, they do require a fair bit of work and wheels will need some time to sit down and fiddle with the guages, each button etc, using a controller is fine with me for now until my G27 plays nicely.I almost refunded at one point, had written a length statement but decided, no, I am going to stick with it.Running on an i5 3570, 16GB RAM, Zotac AMP! GTX 980ti getting around 40fps in cities with traffic, and 50 mostly on the motorways.Hope this was helpful in your decision to purchase or not."

76561198170646743,Recommended,427100,29377487,Posted: 20 January,all,Fixxxer,For me Fernbus Simulator was one of those you see it you want it games. Watched some early beta gameplay videos on youtube and that was enough to start the desire to have and to play the game. When it came out I got it only to discover that my PC wasn't powerful enough to run the game. An upgrade later I was finally able to get the game to open and with a lot of fiddling with the settings got the controls and graphics stable.As is widely documented this appears to have been rushed to release so there are a number of bugs in the game.  But that does not mean that it is unplayable.  The ones that I have come across only break the immersion momentarily. AI Spawning points being the main one.Once you get into it this is a very relaxing game on a good run. You get the sense of what these inter city coach drivers go through when you're in the middle lane of a motorway doing 90kph with a lorry up your chuff and you've got the passengers going mental because the wi-fi has broken. Suddenly the stress level has gone through the roof. The dynamic events was the biggest draw for me. No two trips on any route will be exactly the same which gives longetivity to the gameplay.  You can have the trip from hell or silky smooth or anything in between.  There is a lot to like and if you can bear with the bugginess it's actually quite addictive. The detail in the coach models is on another level to anything I've seen before. Everything works in the suspension the physics are very well done. You get the sense that you are driving something big and heavy and that you should show it some respect. Because if you don't it will bite you very hard.The only thing that is really missing is a detailed tutorial of how you are expected to drive a coach. I like to think of it as being a chauffeur with a very big vehicle.  The passengers certainly get vocal if you start throwing it around too much and you get marked down for it in the assesment in career mode. So why not teach people what they are supposed to do?Try it for yourself. If you already have OMSI in your library you will love this. A lot of the bad press this game has received  IMHO has been from people that don't get what Simulation games are about.

TML Studios develops the coach simulator with great graphics and detail, despite this however, I have returned the game due to many negativities.The Good:- Unreal Engine provides realistic graphical prowess- Numerous cities/towns and other scenery- Provides many real-life events along the route (construction, etc.)- Included Man Lions Coach, and Man Lions Coach C provides a great level of detail- Detailed elements from Flixbus company (check-in progress, Flixbus app, announcements, etc.)- Customisable journey’s for the user- A stunning menu soundtrack- Customisable resolution allows for the simulator to fit in nearly every displayThe Bad:- AI is severely lacking (evident vehicle spawns/despawns, vehicle behaviour/road manners, passengers in awkward locations after getting off the coach)- Unforeseen penalty’s (random penalties for ‘steering misbehaviour’, etc.)- Poor optimisation for low end machines (achieving very low fps)- Very low draw distance when on low settings- Roads don’t load on low settings (I always enter a city without roads)- Only two, very similar coaches included with the game- Coach driving manners don’t respond to slippery weather or changing gradients- Many Bugs (somehow my coach went up to 140km/h in a matter of seconds)- Difficult to play with keyboard (auto-centre steering wheel centres to quickly)- Settings menu’s in need of an english grammar check- Abnormal resolutions set (not on the settings list) has no cursor calibration- Map HUD is zoomed way too much in both city and highway allowing for a late response from the user at the next navigation pointOverall, Fernbus Simulator is still a great game despite its drawbacks. The biggest selling point for Fernbus is that there are very realistic graphics, and the game is always updated with new features and bug fixes. From my initial impressions, I have discovered many areas in which the simulator needs refinement especially in the artificial intelligence (AI) of the game. Please take note that this is not a beta and Fernbus is an officially released game, however it feels like its still in early stages, and I believe that it should not be released with the sheer number of negatives affecting the gameplay. Maybe in a number of months or possibly a year, Fernbus Simulator would be much more stable, however I have returned the game. If your keen on waiting it out on a more refined Fernbus in the future, I wouldn’t blame you, however its the only decent coach simulator on the market, and improvements are made consistently through updates so it’s worth a try if you have a decent PC setup."

I have a great pc that can run most anything out there today, however in this game with the graphics turned down a bit I still struggled to get 60fps. Also the UI is not the most intuitive to use, but it's not bad either. The biggest thing for me is the price. At $35 I have a really hard time reccomending it, and with omsi 2 at the same price, I'd rather spend my money on that. I'd overall give the game a 6/10. It's a great game that with some UI and optimization tweaks, could easily be something worthy of it's $35 price tag. I'd say don't get it, unless it's on sale."

,Recommended,427100,25134046,"Posted: 25 August, 2016",all,Inaccurate Marksman,"I was looking forward to this game but it's not finished at all.It is very laggy and poorly optimized, even at low-medium settings.(specs at the end of the review)There are also lots of bugs, for example passengers standing on top of each other.The AI needs a lot of improvement. Now they brake for no reason and spawn right in front of you.Because of all the bugs and the very poor performace I cannot recommend this game.Unfortunately I have played more than 2 hours, otherwise I would have requested a refund.When the devs fix the bugs and improve the performance, this review can certainly turn into a positive one.My specs:AMD FX 6300AMD R9 290X8GB RAMEDIT: Originally this was a negative review, but a lot of the bugs that made the game unplayable for me have been fixed.There are still a few problems though.In my opinion the speed limits are too strict.(you already get penalty points when you go 1 kmh over the speed limit)Sometimes you can still see the AI spawn, but it is less annoying than it was before.My computer needed replacing so these are my current specs:I7-6700GTX 108016GB RAMThe computer upgrade made the game run a lot smoother. I experience almost no lag/ freezes with all the settings on epic."

The priority should be AI and physics foor the studio to work on because AI is not very good righ now and easily can cause traffic jam. Physics are not satisfying right now because I can drive a huge uphill the same speed and same rpm I do while going downhill. As everbody else said navigation should be improved to show the next turn etc. Also most of the time the speed signs and the speed limit in the navigation don't match.I bought this game knowing all of its problems because I saw that the sutdio is working and listening the problems of customers. I believe soon all these problems will be solved. I remember the first time of ETS and ETS2 and the only thing that made ETS2 this much successful is that SCS worked hard on it by listening the customers. I believe the same will happen if the player community will not be harsh and help to the game studio and they solve the said problems.EDIT: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! I recommended it in this review before but now that NOTHING really is done on improving it and the devs try to sell a THIRD BUS to the game FOR 15 EUROS showed me their real intentions. Game is still buggy as hell, not any real improvement is done and they already started CHARGING for the stuff that should be free. What the hell is wrong with you guys? I totally regret buying this game. It is really sad that this game was hyped for being unique and having potential but the devs just killed it all. I don't know why I was so naive as you can see my review before the editted part above.."

Works in ETS2 and ATS just fine. It looks like once they get the game optimized and ironed out it has potential. My only ripe is with this game not recognizing steering wheels easily. Hopefully it gets fixed for the next patch."

,Not Recommended,427100,25327674,"Posted: 3 September, 2016",all,~YNWA~,It's an ok game. It for sure needs work and is not worth the price atm. I just feel that the game is a bit too repetitive. There is no real career mode. It doesn't take long at all to unlock all the things in the career mode. The game also still has a few game breaking bugs that haven't been ironed out in the update.I think the game still needs some work to be worth the price. I believe they can and will improve. I would say to wait on buying it for a bit longer and see if they actually make it better though.

I run the game at 35 - 60 Frames Per Second and it's more then playable. If you have a bad PC don't buy the game. I really enjoy playing it and i think some other people might do that too.So i would say i recommend this game beacuse i like busses and trucks."

Oh boy... I regret I can't return it anymore. If you like:* Disappearing A.I.* Disappearing objects like trees or buildings* Crazy A.I. stopping in the middle of the road without a reason and without any braking (they just stop in spot)* Wooden-like people* No Force Feedback (Simulator? Meh...)* No in-game Radio* No ground physics/feedback* No goalthis game is for you and you can put the thumb up. Mine goes down. I will continue to observe this product but considering what they actually tried to fix in last couple of patches, it's never going to be really fixed."

Back in 29 of August 2016 I posted a really negtive review on this game and got it refunded. About five days ago I got this game back again and I thought to myself how much of a noob I was back then. (I was going into year 6 now going into year 7). Now the game is great! I must say the only bad thing about this game  is the  traffic is still terrible!Wonderful buses.Map has too much detail that is how amazing this game is.If you are into Buses and Coach driving I recomend this game to you.
