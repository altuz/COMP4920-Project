There is not much content right now, but that is fine because the core game mechanics and control schema is well thought out and executed. I am so tired of developers trying to sell me bad VR alpha and beta tech demos so they can get a piece of the cut.  If you are an early VR adopter looking for compelling use cases, this is one of them. Buy this game and support the devs!"

It feels natural!Attention to detail is astounding, there's a lot in here that simply doesn't need to be, and totally rounds out the experience as a whole (especially the little bot, I call him Buzz ^_^)The navigation is top notch, wether its teleporting to different areas or going through the menu, everything is easy to pick up immedietlyBEST TUTORIAL IN ANY VR GAME. PERIOD. One major issue with VR games is that many don't have a solid tutorial, and leave you to either figure it out, or search the interwebs. For anyone who owns a Vive, the interwebs probably aren't a foriegn land, but having such a solid tutorial is really a standout right now.Cons-Its not finished. Straight up, that's the only con. This is the very first release of an Early Access, so of course it isn't finished, but it's very not finished. There's even a little blip in the instructions that seems to refer to capturing towers (of which there are two on the map), but the actual mechanic for capturing them simply doesn't exist. You can also see all of the locked spaces in the menus where they plan on putting more things.Overall-Get it. Yes, it's severely lacking in content, and if the devs tried to release it right now, as a full game, I would say screw them. But, this is the first in many betas to come, and I will be absulutley astounded if this doesn't jump in price, because the gameplay is just THAT GOOD.To the Devs-You are men, with a very particular set of skills.Now, I don't know who you are, but I will find you, and I will play every game you've ever created.Because you my friends, are amazing! Keep up the hard work, I cannot wait to play more of Cosmic Trip and or any other games you put out in the future (Seriously, I'll play them in Alpha, or Pre-Alpha! That's how much I like this XD)."

,Recommended,427240,32118928,Posted: 1 June,all,"David ""TheDave"" Eastwick","Cosmic Trip -Prove that VR is not just about the fps games with your new Robot pals!I got approached to review this game a few days ago and realised that i had it in my library, but do not recall much about it, i am so glad they approached me as i feel i have found a gem hidden in my library!Now most people think VR means first person shooters but it is so much more than that and this RTS(Real Time Strategy) game shows this very well! After some teething issues with choosing the wrong mode(for me) at the start i had a ton of fun, there is nothing quite like ordering a swarm of bots at the enemy location and zipping ahead to see them swooping down a tunnel towards death or glory!This is a very fun RTS with cool designed bots and a surprisingly deep strategy elementROOMSCALE / ENVIRONMENTThe environments are really beautiful and with the teleport doors you soon find that there is multiple zones all connected, i did have an issue with my play space where part i was a tiny bit limited on one side, there is no movement beyond your feet and the teleport doors.The main lobby is your ship and it has some cool little functionalities and a very nice designed menu.GRAPHICSThey are awesome! The little bots are very well made and animate so nicely, there is a bot that plays the games music, a mascot if you will who waves at you when you wave to him and loves to have his belly rubbed….this has to be the only game i can say i gave a bot a belly tickle lol (don't tell my cat!)Likewise the stations you place are all well designed and i loved how the turret was done, it feels really awesome to quickly lock your controllers onto it and start blasting aliens and the strut for it realistically animates to your movement.With the bot animations, seeing your medical bot fly about and heal your units looks good and you can tell each robot apart easily.You can also put little hats and glasses on your bots, because...well it is cool ok, there does not need to be a reason lolPERFORMANCENo issues at all, even when i ordered a swarm of 10 to 15 battle bots to attack the enemy and watched as they swooped over, at no time did i lose frame or suffer reprojection.INTUITIVENESSThis is a mixed thing, on one hand it has a tutorial and once you get used to the controls its really smooth and intuitive but some things are missing from the guides, i assumed at first the teleport portals were a means to say “this area done” rather than a means to get about, now i have played for a bit i wonder how i could of been so mistaken lol.I am going to say that yes it is intuitive, with minor niggles.The map controls are really well done and it will not be long before you are sending your robot hoard here there and everywhere...though i did manage to get lost lolPROS:Really well made animations and graphics.Under the VR and cutesy graphics there is a good rts engine.You can put a top hat on a bot and throw it at an enemy, got to look dappa when you take on aliens!The ui is super awesome, it is perfectly suited to vr.Nothing can truly describe how awesome it is to see a swarm of your robots swooping past on their way to your enemies!You know i said the graphics are really good? Yeah they won awards on them (2016 Proto Awards and best visual design at the 2016 VR Core awards)The strategy mode provides you with more of a challenge for those that want it.When testing out the ability to disable the ui (see last con additional note) i discovered that you can configure a whole host of the characteristics of the game, you can really tweak it to your hearts content, this is very rare in a non moddable game and simply has to go into the pro section!CONS:No ability to move around the area you are in apart from physical movement, making those with small room-spaces somewhat limited, i would like to see limited teleportation in the areas. * The Developers have replied to this and expressed you can teleport by simply putting your controller in an open teleport node and hitting the trigger, that helps a little but an ability to move around your location beyond physical would be majorly handy (limited of course to a bubble around it, for gameplay sake)It could be made clearer chill is easy vs Strategy which is hard (at first glance you think chill is no enemys and strategy is normal, this is not the case)Twitch logo is shown on the second screen (this is what is normally streamed) advertising twitch can be a no no on some other stream sites for partners. The cosmic trip logo is also quite large.*The developer informed me that this can be disabled in Default.json in the game settings folder, while not ideal this does make this a mute point and revealed a massive plus the developers kept secret..... (last pro on the list)The first try video: Strategy modehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cM2l1mecAuYThe second try video: Chill modehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03GGhv7EP8oVERDICTThe game is a lot of fun if you love rts games, it could do with a little more depth granted but what is here is very fun. Want a break from FPS vr games? Go grab this award winning title, you will not regret it!"

It feels like an AAA game* Really made for VR - Awesome haptics, the joy of throwing bots around, cool user interactions with everything* Beautiful graphics* Very well optimized, this is a great looking VR game and even with 40+ bots i didn't drop a frame on my old crappy 280x* The core gameplay is addictive, satisfying and engaging. Building bots, plugging in batteries, deploying bots and even navigating the ui all feels fluid, fun and funky.Cons:* Since this is an early access game you should know this allready - there is very little content.

VR needs more games that have this AAA level of polish to them. Gameplay is fun even in such an early stage of development, even if it's too easy. Game looks like it has a LOT of potential to be really awesome, and I love how devs plan to turn this from a tiny wave based experience into a full blown RTS, drawing inspiration from SC2 / C&C."

This game brings the best out of VR to create a first person/RTS game. It's got a couple different maps and some wave based score modes. Kudos to the biggest win of all. Developers that listen to a playerbase. This is in my book a must for VR owners. Runs and feels great. Very worth 20$
,Recommended,427240,31289568,Posted: 21 April,all,Captain Otter,"Do you want to step away from unity prefabs?Then this game is for you. It has its unique asthetics down and will transform your playing space into somewhere that looks and feels alien. The sounds are fresh, and the visuals are a refreshing change from other VR games which can often feel the same after a while or you start to recognise prefabs.This game is also not dreary, it feels vibrant, happy. You're not playing a horror title here.The weapons and building systems are fun. You build towers and little robots help you mine and defend against bad guys. It can be a little challenging but it's not quite as stressful as VR games where you've gotta constantly duck out of the way which can often lead to fatigue.Def reccomend, throw some space frisbees into some dudes and forget about all the stuff you really should be doing."

76561198027802652,Recommended,427240,30737171,Posted: 25 March,all,AnythingQuiet,"For an early access game, this is really well polished. I've been looking for a resource management/pet simulator kinda game and this met all my expectations.You basically build up your little robot army and collect crystals. When you defeat aliens they drop ectoplasm you can use to get better upgrades. Right now there's only about 4 upgrades and 4 alien types.The biggest highlight is your little robot pals. When the aliens attack you feel compelled to protect your little guys. You have your one main robot pal who responds really well to being petted. My favorite experience, besides alien battling, was when I built a turret and was about to buy a battery for it but one of my harvester robots fetched me a battery I must've dropped somewhere earlier. It was a really endearing action on its part. :D"

,Recommended,427240,23533862,"Posted: 13 June, 2016",all,jennytoo,"First, right off the bat, there's just not much content yet. If you want a game with a lot of content already here, this is the wrong game. There are two bots you can build - harvesting and defense -  and three types of machines - factory, harvest, and defense.Now, what is here seems to be fairly well done. Lots of attention to minor details.Pros:* There have been a lot of comments about the pros, and I pretty much echo them. Haptics, visuals, details, etc. All done well.Cons:* Popping up the menu on top of an item meant I couldn't interact with the menu. I had to move it first.* Lag. Enemies attack you wherever you are, so I had swarms of defense bots anywhere I could go. It got laggy - admittedly I had probably over a hundred bots out but in this type of game having huge numbers of units doing all the work is entirely reasonable, and I expect a game to pretty much be able to handle anything I can throw at it.* Every time I restart my computer I need to set the audio port again, and set the volume. I hadn't done the latter (my fault!) but it meant everything was annoying loud, and beep-beep-beep look at me, and blaring boombox bot and everything was making noise and it wanted my attention RIGHT THE EFFIN NOW.I /hated/ the boombox bot.I got the volume fixed, but the point is there is a lot going on and vying for your attention at first and it was a bit overwhelming and put me off a little bit initially. It was a lot less annoying once I got accustomed to what was going on, and figured out that the music was useful to know when the boombox bot wanted my attention.* I couldn't figure out how to repair boombox bot. If it wasn't in the area and a wave was starting, it'd appear in the sky and tumble to my feet blaring music and trying to get my attention - but it never would fly again. :( (It got caught out alone when a wave hit just as I was leaving a node I hadn't built up)Awwwws:* I went to one of my areas and discovered the battery in my harvester was dead. I had a handful of harvest bots, each with a crystal, swarm me and shove their crystals at me in a plaintive 'please take these we don't kow what to do. the harvester is broke' kinda way. I couldn't help but to smile at them.Overall, there is a lot of awesome potential. There has definitely been some love put into it already, but there isn't much actual content yet. The game is playable as-is, but limited. You pretty quickly figure out how to trivialize the waves of enemies. If you can afford it then it's well done and fun, but if you want a more complete game then give it some time and come back."
,Recommended,427240,25760775,"Posted: 28 September, 2016",all,Auburok,"This is difficult to review due to the current game offered. I wish there were a ""Recommended once out of Early Access"" selection.What is it?A strategy game in room-scale VR. It's very similar to a tower defense game; as a player you build structures and bots, and you can assist your autonomous forces with turrets, frisbee lasers, etc.Is it fun?Yes.Should I buy it?Not yet. I'll explain.The game is very intuitive, and the mechanics are very fun, but there's a severe lack of content. What's in the game is very polished, and aside from some preformance issues when there's a lot of robots flying around, there's not a lot I can fault it on aside from said lack of content. I think once they start filling in things to do, this could be one of those ""must buy"" VR games that gets copied due to how mechanically satisfying it is.Is it worth trying if I have a chance/have access to the game?Yes, via family sharing or going to someone's house. It's definitely worth trying, it just might not be worth buying quite yet."

Although I was able to beat the game in a couple of hours, it was incredibly fun. I am sure they will be adding more awesome stuff in the weeks to come.The best thing about it, they nailed the interaction. So easy to do what you need to do to defend your base. It is both challenging and incredibly fun.

There's 2 buildings you can set up and a turret. One building makes robots but you can only build 3 kinds, workers, shooters, or medics drones. You can apprantly build as many shooter drones as you want without any consequences except it crashes your frame rate.Waves spawn every minute or two, you throw frisbees at them and your robots shoot them.

It's currently not particularly hard, eventually you end up with so many bots at every expansion that you just don't care and only teleport to replenish batteries in refineries and maybe build some new bots for good measure. But content will come! I look forward to more enemy types, attacks on different bases (especially not the ones you're currently at) etc.As it stands right now the game looks and sounds great, the building menu is really intuitive and I love that I an queue a bot cartridge in each hand for rapid double bot factory building. There are some bugs and quirks, but it's too early to critisize....my only problem was that cute friend bot. Quite early on he stopped floating and just lay on the ground, ocassionally waving his little cutesy robot hand at me. I picked him up and tried to feed him a battery, but he just wouldn't take it! It was breaking my heart, so I made sure to take him in my hand every time I teleported so he wouldn't have to move on his own."

At this point you'll probably get a few hours worth of game play and thats the point where I have to think about recommeneding the game.It has the foundations for what could be one of the better VR games but it still needs  more to do. A few more things to build and a campaign / story line.I'll recommend it but at this point be aware it seems more a long tech demo (and a very good one at that) rather than a fleshed out game."

Obviously its early access and its very open about what it is upfront, but I would hold off until the game is fully released or at least sees major updates.I gave it a positive rating because, aside from a few major bugs, I really do see the potential in this game much later down the line.

I plan to spend many more hours with this, to experiance the other modes. I only have used the casual mode and found it addictive. The wave mode is next for me. But I encourage others to try this. sort of a strange intro, could be cleaned up. how, I have no idea, better transition in to base build? don't know.

Then went and bought it. This along with EVE Valkyrie are games I've purchased for the Vive right after buying the Vive. EVE Valkyrie was suppose to be my ""end all"" game I was going to dump hours into.This simple little game just blue EVE out of the water for me. Heck, I even told myself I would probably not like any of the stand up do things games. Cosmic Trip has really made me rethink my opinion.If you just got VR, this game is a must have. It does what the VR is good at, and it has a fantastic art style. It's a shining example of what other games should try to accomplish. I honestly wish I could wander the island a lot more. I seriously hope that this team creates more maps and more content for the game. I'd absolutely, hands down, buy DLC if it were the same game but new worlds/levels to explore and conquer. It's just drop dead gorgeous and tons of fun to explore."

They've also released a rather awesome user guide. Call me old fashioned, but I miss the days of game manuals. Just had a flick through and they've done a great job with this one.This game is a lot of fun and incredibly frantic. You will work up a sweat and for this reason and others I do encourage the developers (as I know others have) to add a proper pause function and/or a save game function.It's also not an easy game. It took me 5+ hours spanning several play throughs to get a win in Strategy mode. Maybe I'm just really bad at it, and I guess the challenge is part of what makes it addictive. Having said that it took me a couple of play throughs to really work out what was going on and what I was supposed to be doing. The tutorial is good for explaining the controls, but it feels quite disconnected from the main game and I don't feel like it gave me a good introduction to the genuine gameplay. I do wonder whether some different levels of difficulty could also be introduced. It can be pretty off-putting to play several times in a row and not win, thus obtaining a score of 0 each time (and FYI, I have literally no idea how that scoring system works once you do win).The game calls itself an RTS and it definitely is, but it doesn't feel like any RTS I've played before. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, just be aware that if you're into traditional RTS games that doesn't necessarily mean this game is for you (and vice versa). This is an RTS for VR. What that means is you're doing a lot of micro-managing and rushing around a lot. And you really do feel like you're rushing around over large distances, despite being in the confines of your living room.In this game, you can't keep yourself out of harms way and let your bots do all the work and of course if you die, it's game over. In VR, being overwhelmed by swarms of enemy minions is truly quite terrifying.Overall, I'd say this game is a triumph in what it sets out to achieve. Now that I've won a game in Strategy mode I look forward to finding out how successful other strategies might be in getting a win, as well as trying out the other game modes."

,Recommended,427240,31103863,Posted: 12 April,all,Syrsly,"Crisp, beautiful scenery mixed with real-time strategy mechanics.Cosmic Trip is crisp, beautiful scenery mixed with RTS mechanics and the ability to zip back and forth between a small collection of defendable locations in a given scene.  While it was very playable in a small space, it did require a lot of roomscale movement to place the bot generators and enter teleport gateways.  It would have been nice to see the teleport mechanic redesigned for seated players, but there's a certain immersion to how it requires you to lean into the portals.The game feels very polished.  It runs smoothly.  It has short loading times.  It sounds great.  It feels immersive.  It looks beautiful.  It provides a very low end friendly experience that won't bog down when tons of enemies flood the scene.  It also has a very well explained control scheme that mostly feels intuitive to someone like myself, who as played RTS games countless times.There are a lot of tiny features to this game which add some extra flavor to the experience.  For example, you can put swag on a drone:https://clips.twitch.tv/LittleAttractivePassionfruitRiPepperonisThere's a surprising amount of challenge in this game, too.  The enemies can easily overwhelm you in some game modes.

Immediately I am thrown into this complicated and seemingly random splay of a map with no idea how actualy game flow is supposed to go. The tutorial did nothing to teach me how the actual game is played, just how to get the buttons to work!I cant find any strategy in bot placement, they just fly around in circles going literally wherever they want, except for inside the walls, even though thats where the enemies are. Yup, every level ive attempted the enemies are in the walls within the first two waves! Therefore all my bots are just flying into the wall and go back there immediately even when I call them off.Placement of buildings doesnt seem to matter either as enemies start sorrounding you are just straight up tunneling(and you cant stop them) into your base. If I think I have a nice turret set up it doesnt matter because my bots fly ahead to the next teleport zone, even when I keep calling them back on the map. This forces the enemies to engage them way out of my range and even around corners!I am super confused why the shield is positioned the way that it is and its super distracting. Throwing weak discs that need to be charged takes what feels like forever and really doesnt make me feel like there is any strategy involved in my success.I am getting a refund, will keep an eye out for updates though."

The developer seems to have put a lot of work into designing this game so it really works in VR. And it does. Using the user interface is incredibly intuitive and just ""feels right"". Placing buildings and building robots is very statisfying.Even more statisfying is throwing space frisbees at those nasty alien attackers or placing a stationary turret which you use to  blast them down using both controllers as handles.The graphics style is also very pleasant. Everything fits really great together, which helps a lot getting immersed in the game world. Together with the intuitive controls it led to the first small dent one of my controllers got as I was trying to throw space frisbees at some giant alien blob and hit the wall. I was just completely sucked in by the game.All in all a great experience which I would recommend to everyone who likes to play around with unfinished software. Everyone else should probably wait a few months and check back once the game has been finished. Hopefully the developer will keep the quality up until then.

,Not Recommended,427240,29368704,Posted: 19 January,all,forasp,"Until significantly more content is added, the game is not worth more than a few dollars. Early access is always a risk, wait for the game to release, or to at least show more signs of progress. At the time of writing, this game has about 20-30 minutes of fun gameplay, but that's really it. It's also lacking some serious GUI functionality, so it can be somewhat frustrating wanting to do basic game things like... exit the current game, restart, save, or really just quit in general. Navigation is not intuitive, and don't even remotely expect to play this game without a LOT of room to walk around, since placing your factories will inevitably block your shots, and your shots take quite a bit of room to make since you're really just throwing frisbees.How to check if you can play this game in your play area: T-Pose, and walk around the center of your room, at about a 2 foot radius of the center. If you don't hit anything, you should be good, otherwise you might want to hold off purchasing just yet. It can feel cramped even in a 2m by 2m play area.I really wanted to like this game...

This was around start of April, one month later my pre-order Vive finally arrived in Aus.I already had a stack of games and the first thing I noticed was that there is no way in hell can you tell if a game is going to be good in VR just by watching a video on a monitor. So I started just buying games by reading reviews and the ""about this game"" instead of the visuals.Now my favourite VR games are Out of Ammo & HordeZ ones which I get the most replay value. So when this was released I read the reviews and the Devs about this game and decided to buy.Glad I did, even though it's early access I lost an hour when I first loaded it and only stopped due to controllers running out of charge. The game play is easy to pick up and fun, the visuals are stunning in game and look very polished, Yes it's early access and feels it but this game like Out of Ammo will be highly replayable when the game is further along.I enjoyed this one very much but I am a fan of RTS and if you are it's a good game to get. Surprised no not really anymore as I said you can't pick them from gameplay videos in VR. You just have to trust the reviews.Update:This games just keeps getting better it's now a proper game and one of the most polished games on the vive.

There's a cap on the amount of drones you can get and there's a slim variety of drones, which means once you get past the first few waves and get collection drones going, you can go full on defense drones and do nothing for a long time. I haven't played hard mode yet, so perhaps there's more challenge there. With all that negativity being said, I'd still suggest people buy it.

The game is way way way too easy.  Eventually I was just curious if you could even die so I stopped fighting back.  Eventually I did die but i just had to stand there watching the bad guys slowly attack until finally i died, is there a health bar somewhere?  Basically as of right now there are three buldings, a refinery for collecting the gem resources, a bot factory for making bots, and a turret for fighting off bad guys.  There are only two bots you can make, a harvest bot and a laser turret defense bot.  What happens is you make a few worker harvest bots and then you start getting laser bots and then pretty quickly you are totally invinsible.  The teleporting around to different spots is a fun idea but it is also pointless because I am beter defended just staying at one point collecting forever.  There also needs to be less time between waves.  I spent most of my time just waiting for the next waves to happen.

I had more miners then i needed, and more crystals that I could ever use. Only way to eliminate bots is to let the enemies kill them off, but with enough laser bots, thats easier said then done.2. Decrease time between waves or make a way to call the next wave. Its a pretty classic mechanic. Up around wave 30 wait times between waves is 4 minutes+. Its just painful.3. A way to increase supply limits on bots, or at least a reason to have multiple bases. Once you cap out, all thats left is to drop a bunch of extra bot makers with disks sitting in them incase something dies. If there is a concern with lag, make a setting to lower the graphics for those with computers that cant really handle it.Can't wait for more!!"

I scrambled to plug them back in (Looking like a complete idiot I'm sure). But, the game handled it perfectly and didn't crash (which is kind of remarkable). I only stopped playing much, much later because I completely drained one the controllers.I'm still seeing bots fly around me as I type...Pros:- I love the game mechanics. It's easy to see the potential of an RTS in VR.- Controls are very well thought out, and extremely intuitive. Some of the best in VR.- Truly addictive gameplay.- You can teleport yourself or your little buddies, sending reinforcements to another station (Extra attention to detail).Cons:- With a lot of enemies and bots (90+) the game will lag, and lag badly. Feels like it's an affect of AI / collision code, and not the typical graphics processing. The sound gets choppy, and many frames are dropped, but not in a way that would make me woozy. When this happens it can prevent you from controlling a turret.  Hopefully this will get fixed, it's still in preview after all :)- A large play space is needed for this game. You will run into problems placing devices outside your walls. I have a decent space, but this game makes me wish I had another couple feet to spread out.- There's not a lot of strategy to the game yet. It's mostly action at this point, but it's still early days.Suggestions for devs:- The turret needs some kind of iron sight. There's the little glass rectangle, but with nothing to pair it with, it's just for show and doesn't really help with aiming.- More things to build! Maybe walls, a shield generator, a laser/sniper cannon (would be nice to defend a station at a distance).- Provide a way to sell/move a device. I made the mistake of placing factories too close to each other making it impossible to load one with new batteries, and I placed my first turret 2 inches outside my reach within a wall. If Items could be moved/sold, then you could allow things to be built in closer proximity (since a poor placement could be fixed) making this more playable for smaller spaces, and thereby more potential players.- The beep sound effect for instructions in the tutorial got extremely annoying within the first 20 minutes of play. Suggest something softer or less intrusive. Something more ""Hey, listen!"" and less ""COMPLY HUMAN!""- When first making the bots it's easy to forget which ones do what, maybe add a little label/icon to their skins, so that you can pull one to you and read what they do. There's a missed opportunity to add some whimsy here with such a description/icon.- The bubble gun recharges too slow to be helpful to me, so I never use it. Maybe if it were ~25% faster recharging?- Switching between bubble gun/shield/disks was the only part of the controls that gave me any problem. Sometimes it just wouldn't let me switch. Needs a bit more ""snap"" range.- Add a ""hero"" bot. There currently isn't much strategy to the game aside from placement of the distance-shooting bots and your turrets. During a battle, you don't have the time to direct bots at all, you just have to fight with them which dilutes the ""strategy"" part of the game. If there was a bot that acted like a General, that could ""command"" a few other bots that you throw at it, then you could have some strategy during a battle. By throwing/sending that General bot in a direction you'd be able to control the battle a bit more....ok I'll stop now. Sorry."

So excited to see where it will go.First off, if you're buying this be aware that it is an early access game and thus the gameplay is very limited in the current version. All you are able to do is build a few structures and a couple of different bots and defend your base.I have to say though, this small taste of the game really fills me with confidence in the developers.When I played it, all I could think was, 'this feels very focussed and beautifully designed'. The beautiful design is evident in the screenshots, but when playing in VR you really appreciate how everything looks and feels. This game really 'takes you somewhere'. This is what VR is all about.In terms of 'focus', you really get a feeling from the small amount of gameplay available that the developers put a lot of care into how the game is played.

Hopefully they can follow through and deliver a great finished product because I hungry for more!Dunno if anyone relevant will see this, but I just have some feedback on the sound design: One of the sound effects related to harvesting got quite annoying when lots of minerals were being harvested. Also, the sound that the turrent made seemed very out of place and unsatisfying.Apart from those quibbles I love it!"
,Recommended,427240,23464215,"Posted: 9 June, 2016",all,lil Joshu,"(Early Access Day 1 release review)Although it says it's a real-time strategy, and it's definately got elements, it's closer to tower defense than a true RTS. That said, it's definately a fun game and one of the first strategy games for the Vive, so definately worth taking for a whirl. It's also the first strategy game to ever give me a workout.Pros -* Enjoy the art style* Nice interface* The first real strategy game for the Vive* I think I lost five pounds during my first game alone.Cons -* Small map* Laaaaag. After I got a few dozen bots at each of my bases, everything started lagging like crazy, and I have a very high end gaming rig.* Get-going fast: No challenge / Slow start: die horribly. The difficulty curve leaves a *lot* to be desired. If your first base gets mostly destroyed, you can pretty much pack up and go home* No versus or teams mutliplayer. And RTS without multiplayer is like a JRPG without a plot.* ""Waves"" in a game that claims to be an RTS. Let's not kid ourselves, it's not an RTS, it's base defense. In essence, a base defense game is basically a third of an RTS. The other two thirds being tech development and attack. RTS's as a result, don't have to resort to ""waves"". You can hide a secondary base from your enemy and slowly build up while your main base is destroyed, you can do attacks on their base and reduce their numbers, you can turtle or you can early-game rush, or you can come up with strange and weird tactics (in one RTS I recall I used walls - yes walls, basic concrete walls - offensively and wiped out all his capabilities with just walls.... long story, and it was hilarious... for me at least.)* Most things are still locked.Now, all that said, you may see the con list is longer and thing ""Oh well, not worth it."" Well, it's worth a good solid 3 hours of gameplay at least, and that's on day 1 release. Since it claims to be an RTS, I hope it gets further along that road (only time will tell.) And get more things to unlock and more tech and more RTS elements. Again, it's the only strategy game for the Vive so far, so I hope for good things from it."

I managed to reach a point where the incoming resources far exceeded the needed resources to survive.  I had so many bots spawned, the frame rates were dropping significantly.  All i had to do was pull out the Turret on occasion and assist the laser bots.Even so, this game shows a ton of promise!  The feeling of creating the laser bots and tossing them into position is satisfying, and creating each stronghold was entertaining.  It get tedious at first, but smoothes out as you build up.  After 40 waves, the game felt too repetative, but im sure there will be new bots, defensive structures, and enemies in time.Pros: Graphics are incredible.  I really like the animations and design of the game.  The enemies maybe need a redesign, but the overall aesthetic was nice.  Game mechanics are super fun.  The teleport feature works great and doesnt disorient me, although i suspect VR sensative people may complain.Cons: All cons at the moment are mostly due to it being a demo.  Im sure they will be addressed when the full game is completed and released.  There is no quit/exit button when you are in game.  Enemies are very mindless.  Need smarter and more varying enemies.  Two bots is boring.  Cant wait for more bots to defend and collect resources.  I see the turret has a slot load...maybe this is already in the plans, but being able to load a Turret with custom AIs would be cool!Thats all i feel like writing at the moment...Its a great game and definitely recommend VR peeps to check it out!

I have spent about 15 minutes just moving back and forth between places using them because not only are they well designed, but they are really fun to use.

76561198025602654,Recommended,427240,23461276,"Posted: 8 June, 2016",all,steckums,"Pros:- This game has charm. The characters, buildings, and environment, are all very well done.- Moving around the world is done by stepping through portals you open up from the ground. This is a really clever use of space, and works great in my 2.4m x 2m space.- Gameplay consists of building up your base, and bot army in a survival mode against a (seemingly) endless wave of aliens. You can also take out the enemies yourself by throwing razor frisbees at them, by taking their shots and throwing them back, or shooting out of a turret. All of this seems really smooth, and there are no issues with throwing physics or aiming with the turret.- Being in early access you've gotta be careful with this mindset, but there is a TON of potential for how the Strategy game mode will be. The core concept is sound, we just have to wait and see what the execution is- The devs have been great communicators so far. They hang out in Discord and talk about stuff!Cons:- I actually solved the early build. I built 40+ laserbots and was able to let the game sit for 40+ waves. Made it to wave 85 before I stopped.- Actually building 40+ laserbots might be problematic for most setups. Running a GTX 1080, I was still able to see a minor performance hit during waves, Anything less than that and you'll start to lag around wave 20 orI recommend this game highly. If the devs can keep everything moving forward at a steady pace, this game has a ton of potential to hit an untapped market in the VR space."

I can't wait to see what the future brings for this game."
,Recommended,427240,23494619,"Posted: 10 June, 2016",all,*<<=Hau5master=>>*,"Caveat: This review is for the first build available for Steam.Wow, where to start....First off, a warning: If you are looking for a complete game, look elsewhere. There isn't much here yet and those expecting a full or meaningful experience will most likely be disappointed.However, this game justoozespotential, looks amazing, and beyond a minor performance hiccup when a lot of units are loaded: it runs beautifuly. So if you want to see a great RTS/Tower Defense game for VR, by all means drop some cash and support these developers. I'm sure you've spent money on worse things.If you want to know more, read on, but my warning stands. Buy the game to support it's development and help guide it's creation. If you want a full game you'll have to wait because this isnt it.Good? Good.ANYWAYS:This game is my current most anticipated game for the Vive. I first heard about it the day before it released in Early Access on Steam while browsing /r/Vive. The next 18 hours were spent waiting for it to become available to purchase. Once I got it (a steal BTW, at $13.50 USD) I played until my controllers ran out of juice, which admittedly was only about 40 minutes since I passed the time beforehand playing Xortex.I was floored. The graphics, the interface, the shiny polish on every nook and cranny. The controllers alone were gorgeous, with little windows and moving parts and that little display that shows what you're pointing at. The haptics were insane: grabbing bot-disks and activating the frisbee weapon felt great, while getting attacked by the squid enemies literally felt like getting shocked in the hands.Opening a portal and stepping through is just as fun as it looks in the trailer, although I found myself poking my head through more than actually stepping inside. There is no teleport mechanic beyond this, so the game is more room-scale than standing, though the latter works fine (just dont hit anything IRL).I felt my purchase was justified in that short playtime.Of course though, theres some flaws.Like I stated earlier: this ""game"" is only just barely that. There are only 2 units and 3 buildings to construct currently: a worker bot, a laser bot, a bot factory (to build the bots), a refinery (to process minerals to buy bots with), and a mounted turret you take control of to shoot down enemies. All buidings require a battery (batteries not included) at an additional cost and they drain over time, needing to be replaced when they run out. If you have some handy your workers will replace them for you, just buy some extra and throw them on the ground.There are also only 3 enemy types: close-range squids, long-range nautilus, and a Big Bad Orb that humps you into submission (Big-O). In the only available mode (survival) enemies appear in waves at your current location. The game ends when you die. Dying is also the only way to get back to the main menu, as there is no pause feature yet.There is no balance, build 20 or more laser bots and you can go AFK for a drink or toilet, even a shower, and not die. Bots are very, very cheap to the point they're practically free. There are only two resources: crystals and gel. Crystals are mined SCV-style from mineral deposits by workers and gel is dropped by dead enemies. Gel is only used for batteries and the turret, but it's not an issue since batteries last a long time on everything but refineries and you only need 1 turret at each base (if you even use more than 1 base).If this game were priced higher or not in Early Access, the amount of content would be criminal.HOWEVER:I still reccomend this game.Why? Because everything that exists currently just feels soright. There is SO much potential here. I haven't been this excited for a game on the Vive. I was a little disappointed in how much was done, but I don't really care in the end (it doesn't even matter). I wanted to support these developers in making this happen.FunkTronic released this game to get feedback from us on how best to bring an RTS to VR. I personally believe they can bring it (in spades) and will aid them in any way I can.In short: If you want to see a gorgeous RTS made for SteamVR, buy this game and support the developers. The price will only increase over time. Buy it, play it, give feedback.If you'd rather wait till theres more content, please do so. If you don't think what amounts to 15-30 minutes of content justifies a $15 price tag then by all means, skip it, wait, check back next week/month. It's an Early Access title, know what you're getting before you get disappointed.I hope this helps those looking for justification on buying Cosmic Trip. I think it's worth it. I hope you do too."

The items worked really well and smooth, animation was really good and had lots of character. Hope to see more from this or similar style games. Though I loved it, it's a bit easy as it is. Enemies are all the same and if you have any RTS background mining becomes quite easy after the 5th round or so. Not enough things to spend on. Price is a bit steep for what you get in EA but I hope for more to come."

It shows so much potential, but in its current state it gets old after the first two plays. All three ""game modes"" are practically identical, so there's no replay value. It's so easy it gets boring after a while. Also the 25 unit maximum cuts the game time down to about 20 minutes, after which nothing interesting happens for a very long time. The waves don't get more difficult, and you stock up on resources endlessly. Of course, this could all change very quickly when the developers add more features. I can't wait for the updates."

There may be some balancing issues, cause my bases get annayalated in no time at all if I leave them, but them I think I need to spend more time trying to expand my terretories, but then all my old bases get killed, limiting my recorses, and now I'm deep in enemy territory with few available upgrades (cause the enemy destroied them all) and I'm screwed.If I stay in one spot the enemy tosses too many bad guys at me and I die.I'm going to have to figur eout a better strategy."

It certainly has come a long way with a much wider variety of towers, bots, powerups, ennemies, environments, modes, etc.I'll now recommend this game.  However, the game's tutorial is still not enough.  I STIILL, even with the health bars, don't really know how well I'm doing while I playing.  I've tried quickly settings up additional bases, but then my first one quickly gets destroyed.  Then I tried really creating a very complete and elaborate first base before moving on, but then there weren't anymore ressources near the next areas.  I guess I can try something in between...or some other strategy...Any tips from other players would be greatly appreciated.  I feel as though I'm missing a very important aspect of the gameplay to successfully complete the strategy mode.  :P***Old review***I only played for 15 minutes because, without health bars, how am I supposed to know how well my towers and robots are doing, or how strong the enemies are?  Even, if this was fixed, I don't see myself coming back to it."

It strangely enough, reminded me of Age of Empires, where you are forced to manage your economy AND worry about combat at the same time. It was super intense.I still wish I could get that little robot guy out of my face though.... I dont see his purpose."

The tutorial is pretty bad, it feels like it's trying to confuse you with vague choppy instructions that don't tell you actually how to play the game, just how to look between your left and right hands that keep blinking to look at the other one. And another annoying feature is that a presumed loading screen is a black tunnel but it doesn't actually start loading until you look at the end of the tunnel. Just load the game please."
