,Not Recommended,427250,28198191,"Posted: 4 December, 2016",all,Armani,"An all around outright disappointment. Originally purchased on the 2nd day of its release, and played it for nearly 1.5 hours before my timer rang and I set my controller down in disgust.Then I waited. Like a rational person, I assumed the developers would make good on their promises of expanding the game with many factions, creating an amazing campaign, and working out the balance of the game.I've been an avid RTS fan for my entire life. From Homeworld, then Warcraft, then Starcraft, the SINS, then Total War, then Company of Heroes, then Men at War, then World in Conflict, and so on. Check my steam library for all I care, I'm fairly confident I've hit all the good bases that exist.I can assure you this game will never amount to anything more than a money grabbing scam.The developers released new factions - in a seperate game. Which they then went and charged full price for. And added integration between the two like a joke.The balance is still horrible. Tanks destroy infantry like toys, and between both games it appears as though to compensate they make the other faction horrendously strong to ""balance it"". I'm skeptical their math guy can stand upright for all his understanding of ""balance.""And - and this is what really ticked me off - the developers CONTINUE to lie. They continue to promise to expand the game, add more content, and even out the balance. All while working on their NEXT seperate game. Unbelieveable. Pretty sure it has something to do with aliens.The only thing to see here is a phenomenal piece of work by a legal team, who somehow managed to get as close as you can get to false advertising without quite crossing the line. Developers are shadey as hell, and I consider this entire game a blemish on my steam account.I would recommend not to buy the game. Also its not fun. Should probably mention that at some point. Its slightly more boring than the original rendition of Pong - the version where you play against the wall."

Even if Steam says it's not (I honestly don't know/don't remember), it really is.Only one faction right now -- however, there's a preview image of a medieval looking faction with mages and skeletons...so who knows what they've got planned.Not a whole lot of unit variety, makes it feel very ""Rock, Paper, Scissory""Cannot garrison buildings. :-(Interface missing some features (like range checking).Important note:If you don't like old-school C&C, you're not going to like this. It's seriously like a modernized version of the original C&C, right down to the sidebar and EVA-like ""assistant"" telling you your base is under attack.If you do like the original C&C, then this game is perfect for you.Overall, considering it's still in development, I'd give the current build a solid7.5/10.Once they get more units and at least another faction in there, this could be an easy9/10for me.As a LAN game, it's perfect. If you've got a good group of friends looking for a classic RTS game, it's worth a buy for that reason alone."

,Recommended,427250,22609369,"Posted: 24 April, 2016",all,Failure.exe,"This game is what I call ""returning to basics."" It's small, short, sweet, and fun to play.As an RTS-Lover, this has to be one of the best new RTSs I've played recently.Here's the rundown:PROS:- Fast paced action. Build and attack, nothing more. Micromanagement is for boring people.- No multiple build queues. Wanna build faster? Get 10 barracks.- 25 Mission Campaign + 10 Mission Co-Op campaign. Each mission has one main objective, and two secondaries. Completing the primary unlocks units. Completing the secondaries allows you to start the missions with extra units/buildings already built.- Soft Counters, just like in the old C&C's. Sure, a Rocket Soldier is good against a tank, but its probably gonna die unless it has quite a few friends to back it up.- No population cap. How I've missed this in a RTS game. Just being able to build your army with only the map size to limit your dream.HALFWAY:- 1 Faction, 12 Units, 2 Turrets. 3 Infantry (2 Offensive, 1 Support), 4 Vehicles (3 Offense, 1 Harvester), 3 Aircraft (2 Offense, 1 Transport). It's not much, but its pretty balanced.CONS:-The game art depicts a Sniper unit (even the menu art) that does not appear in game. WHY?!UPDATE: Apparently the Sniper unit does appear, it's the Commando, armed with a Sniper Rifle and C4, and is only obtainable through drop crates. Not a con anymore.- It lacks the variety and flavor seen in older games (like C&C) or even newer games (like Grey Goo).- Tanks can bring down massive buildings by just touching them, which just causes the buildings to explode. (Wait, why is this a Con? THIS IS ♥♥♥♥ING BRUTAL!)- No Garrison. With so many buildings in the city maps, you would expect garrison to be available.All in all, I truly recomend this game for eveyone who enjoyed the old C&Cs and Dunes, or anyone who has never played a RTS before, but wants to get in on this genre that is surely not dead, as Petroglyph has shown us.One last thing. Petroglyph's 8-Bit team, you guys are the absolute best! Keep up the good work. Peace through power."

They integrate with each other also, just as a sort of screw you to those that didn't want to pay the same price for a reskin of the same game (I'm pretty sure that the medieval dlc is better as well). They advertised hordes on the game like it was a medieval race they were adding, then made it a separate game for the same price.Just check the reviews.

,Recommended,427250,22830667,"Posted: 6 May, 2016",all,Ashelia,"This game is going to scratch one hell of an itch of you're into strategy games. While currently light on content, it has a great multiplayer scene brewing as well as singleplayer and  co-op missions that are a huge challenge. Better yet, the developers seem devoted to a quick turnaround on their timeline full of updates. In fact, since I got it, they've already patched several times for balance updates (including a bug I had with co-op missions), and June promises a lot of new content coming our way including a new faction.Of course, it has some issues (slight input lag for certain micro hotkeys, only one faction, a lack of solid multiplayer matchmaking) but it has a huge heart and a decent skill curve. Additionally, the voxel art style works perfectly against all odds to make this visually superior RTS with a lot of clarity. Sometimes smaller RTS games can be obtuse or deceiving, but not 8-Bit. It rewards players for learning build orders and improving their micro.Keep in mind that it's very much a spiritual successor to CnC. That said, I feel like it does enough on its own to stand out as more than that and make a name for itself on its on two feet.Again, if you like strategy games or enjoy doing co-op missions, it's one of the best titles on Steam for you at the moment."

I still recommend it but theres a few issues. 1 Multiplayer menu is very laggy and takes a while ( upto 5-10 minutes ) to get a game going online and this brings the game down slightly.I feel that the game is very tank rushy, so far every game ive played has basically been, who can spam the tanks fastest wins and for me that really kills it as I want to try and develop a play style of my own instead of just joining the rest of the crowd and tank rushing.That is a real shame I think it brings the game down slightly.Also really not a fan of the resources running out and the game just stagnates completely with no way to change your fate once resources are gone. So basically no ""comeback is real"" opportunities which kept the late game very interesting in C&C.I love the fact the game is simple however, its almost too simple. I completely understand its supposed to be clean etc but, would be nice to have a few more units with some abilities. Not over the top but just a few.Surprisingly the Nukes are not a game finisher which is good as people in old RTS's used to just avoid super weapons because they would just reck any player and would be a bit lame. So thats well done.Imo this game has great potential, polish up the multiplayer menu responsiveness and match making, add some more units and try and get away from the rapid tank spam as usual and I think this would be a GREAT quick and easy RTS.RIch"

76561198011094835,Not Recommended,427250,23943414,"Posted: 29 June, 2016",all,Primagen,"8-Bit armies harks back to the golden days of RTS; where base building, expansion, and spamming played more of a role in how the game was won rather than the actual use of units. For anyone familiar with the Command and Conquer Franchises' original installments, then they should feel right at home with 8-Bit Armies - after all, some of those same developers worked on this game and the interface is nearly identical.Unfortunately, 8-Bit Armies falls abit short of the mark of being a good RTS. While it pays homage to the RTS of days of old, it also failed to take note of where those games did poorly, and even shrugs off some of the innovations that would've made this game less tedious.---Campaign/Story---The Campaign is little more than a series of challenges that take place on multiplayer maps. These challenges can range from collecting X amount of resource before X amount of time or destroying specific enemy structures, to wiping them out entirely.The campaign is, well, a lot harder than it has any right to be. As a veteran RTS player, I was actually shocked at the level of difficulty between the beginner mode and the medium mode, and even doing co-op with a friend who had little experience I found the odds on some maps were stacked impressively against you.The story is nearly non-existent, and that's fine. Gameplay is really what matters, but some effort beyond the text briefing in the windows for each mission would've been nice.The campaign specific challenges seem rather absurd, too. Perhaps I am not familiar enough with the game but completing some of the objectives while restricting yourself seems rather impractical, especially when the AI can run your troops over rather easily. The unavaliability of vehicles in some missions is made more difficult by the additional challenges. The first co-op campaign mission bonus requires you to complete the mission in less than 10 minutes, without any rocket infantry. This wouldn't be a problem if a harvester wasn't capable of catching your troops and running most of them over. The time restraints are made more difficult to fulfil due to how difficult expanding in this game is to other resources.----GAMEPLAY----Collect resources. Build structures. Build units. Overwhelm the enemy with units. The game is a bit lacking in strategy., There aren't really any effective means of harassment (the harvesters are impressively strong - able to withstand a multitude of barrages from large attacking forces of even anti-vehicle units) which renders harassment tactics effectively defunct.It plays very much like an old command and conquer game, except well, less well thought out. Buildings can be constructed if you have a HQ on the battlefield. Whether or not your HQ is present is irrelevant beyond that - if it is destroyed, you can construct another one. One of the major problems in the game stems from the lack of an actual option for expanding your base. Buildings can only be placed within the sphere of influence of the HQ - a sphere that grows as you build outwards. Even the first C&C game had a means of expanding (and this game borrows heavily from it -- the entire UI and tech tree is essentially lifted straight from Tiberian Dawn) by constructing a Mobile Construction Vehicle. In this game, you must, unfortunately string together a chain of buildings in an incredibly expensive and inefficient means of getting closer to resources which will often be spread quite far from your base (especially in the 1v1 maps).The Guardian faction seems poorly thought out in comparison to the Renegades. Having no anti-air infantry what so ever   and not requiring a tech upgrade for engineers (who repair friendly units) while the Renegades do seems, well, a poor balance decision. The Guardian vehicles are also weaker. They have a ground-transport unit which isn't very useful in comparison to the air-transport the Renegades have. They seem almost like they were rushed with almost no thought put into their design what so ever.Another major problem is the AI's balancing. The gap between the AI's competency is massive. Medium AI will barely do anything. Ten minutes into the game they're struggling to produce units. Hard AI on the other hand, seems to be incredibly competent by comparison. The gap between the AI is so noticable that my friend who I am helping learn the game can smash the medium AI''s without any sort of challenge, but seems to find the hard AI insurmountable.Visually speaking, the game looks great. It runs great. It looks like Habbo Hotel turned into a war game. The name 8-bit Armies seems a bit misleading since this is not even vaguely reminiscient of 8-Bit graphics beyond being blocky.---VERDICT----8-Bit Armies is fun. But the fun it provides is shallow, and doesn't last long. What you have at the end of the day is a game that has potential, and I can't recommend a game based on potential it failed to realize. The simple fact is that the Guardian Faction seems poorly thought out. It should not've been a DLC campaign, considering there is essentially no content in the game already and there are no cutscenes or real story mode to have been added in. There are few multiplayer maps that're poorly thought out due to the utter lack of a reasonable means of expansion for bases, which strikes me as rather silly since they decided to do a lift of essentially everything from Tiberian Dawn and left out one of the most important functions: a means by which to expand your base without having to chain a long line of buildings across the map.Skip out on this one, unless you're really aching for a game that plays like Command and Conquer's first iterations, and even then, be prepared to be disappointed, because while 8-Bit Armies might be twenty years late to the party, and essentially a clone of those early games, it leaves quite a bit to be desired in terms of balance, content, and features."

That's completely fine and a really nice idea, seeing as RTS is an incredibly intimidating genre for some. However, it's far too thin to last long.The game has received a lot of hype by the fact it looks nice and that the people who worked on C&C also worked on it. The soundtrack is also incredible, I turned it up as soon as I got into a game. Excellent rock vibe that stays true to the artstyle of the game with the odd chiptune style music. All good.Gameplay OverviewThe game is incredibly lacking. The game consists of you gathering resources which directly convert into $ so that you can buy units or buildings. Every building costs $ and also consumed X amount of power so you must drop a power building every now and again. That is what managing your economy amounts to. As such, managing your economy is next to nothing.These are not the correct names, but you can build:Resource PointPower PlantBarracksMotor PoolAirportTechnologyNuke platformRadarMachine GunRocket LauncherHeadquarters - This is pointless, you cannot build another unless yours is destroyed.There is a tech tree to this all which basically means that you need the resource plant to build a barracks, but once you build the 'Tech' building everything else is unlocked. In total you will have access to:RiflemenRocketmenEngineersHarvester (Resource Trucks)Armoured CarsTanksArtilleryScout HelicopterAttack HelicopterTransport HelicopterThe gamemode is simply to blow up your opponent's base and this happens pretty damn quick even in larger games. Games have not gone over 30 minutes. We played 4 or so games in 1 hour if that is any indication how short the games can be.ReviewThe game is played PURELY in your base.You cannot build outside of your base, and you will never see the rest of the really nice level deisgn they have done. I noticed, and a friend also commented, that the map layouts were fantastic. Forget it! You're not even going to ♥♥♥♥ing play on them. It's just 'space' between you and the enemy base. The resource points in the centre of the map will rarely, if ever, be touched. When I first played I sent out infantry squads to lock down resource points or harass the enemies only to find that this is impossible because the resource point and harvesters are IN the enemies base. My friend then sent an infantry force (consisting entirely of riflemen, the base infantry unit) to my base which blew it up in a matter of seconds. It's over that fast! Look at the UI in the screenshots and feast your eyes upon the radar map. Do you see how none of the map is discovered and there is purely a single line between the bases? There you have it.As such, harassing and mini-engagements are all but dead in this game. Players usually hold all their forces in their base until they are ready to attack because there is no reason to push out of your base as I explained. Therefore, attacking with a minor force would not net you any sort of benefit seeing as it will be destroyed incredibly quickly and all the enemy has to do is put a few engineers on to repair.Strategy is almost non-existent. The basic idea is simply to build up a bigger army and not get rushed. There is no strategic variance that I can see. Vehicles absolutely dominate over infantry, especially seeing as tanks can instantly squish through infantry. I am not kidding. So many of your infantry taken by surprise could be wiped out in a second if a tank showed up to roll over them. They just cut through them, no pushing or shoving, justsquish. So there is no such thing as an infantry heavy build or anything such. You build tanks and helicopters ASAP, infantry is simply there to make sure you don't get rushed in the first minute. Infantry are further made redundant as Transport Helicopters can either load 5 infantry or 5 tanks. Which would you bloody prefer?You can only construct one building at a time. So, for example, in the moment you either choose between the machine gun or the barracks. You cannot put down a blueprint or queue the building (as far as I know) and decide which one gets built first, or just so you can tend to other things. You do not need engineers to construct buildings, they just start going up (and really slowly). I tried to use my engineers to boost the construction time but this feature does not seem to exist either.The Nuke was an exciting idea but it is basically a ring of death on the battlefield. It takes a few minutes to prepare, you launch it, and any units in the ring are blown up. It does damage to structures, but will not one-hit them. So it is a utility best used on a large group of enemies. However it is very easy to avoid this and move away from it, it is accompanied by a noise, a ring, and a delay on when it lands. This contrasts with other RTS games like Company of Heroes which only gives a small flare on the map, or a ring on the minimap, or even just a sound queue making it a little harder to dodge when engaged. It feels really lackluster and non-special.Buildings are produced only to unlock the units that coincide with them. You build a barracks to unlock infantry and so on. They do not provide upgrades or any other sort of functionality like other RTS games such as Warcraft would have them do.There is a single 'faction' in the game. So no unit differentiation or bonuses. There is a faction coming up which looks like a wizardy-fantasy campaign. Though I have not seen confirmation that these will be free, and I worry that they may end up as DLC you need to pay for.They aimed it to be casual, and an introduction to RTS for new players. They succeeded in the former. However, would anyone really desire to play further RTS games after this I wonder? When I was younger the only board games I were exposed to were Chess and Monopoly. If I had never had a flatmate that loved card games and board games I wouldn't have dreamed of picking up a hobby I now really love. So why show newcomers to a genre really basic, boring, mechanics and say ""Here's your intro to RTS games!"". You don't need to do that, you can have a really deep game that newcomers can have a lot of fun with too so long as you provide the materials to learn. An effective singleplayer campaign, a ranking system, in-game hints, dev tutorials.Don't bother. If you want an intro to RTS games find something that looks really cool to you and put some time in to learn it. Learning it isn't always fun, neither is getting your♥♥♥♥♥beat. But it's a competitve game and some people have the jump in time-played. It wouldn't be any different here, and you're barely getting a game!"
,Not Recommended,427250,32817062,Posted: 26 June,all,emperror85,"It was pretty meh. It overall felt like a an attempt at copying C&C (quite obvious), but the maps didn't feel as well-designed, and it didn't feel like the story shone through in the campaign missions. Instead, the campaign missions felt like an extended tutorial, unlocking one unit per mission. All in all, it's basically a C&C game engine with modern controls, but no real story, and symmetrical maps for balance.If you want to play something that resembles C&C1 multiplayer, this is a good option though."

It's fantastic.I had my first experience with the RTS genre back in the 90s  when my friend introduced me to Command & Conquer: Red Alert. The game was hard, but fun, accessible, and extremely addictive. I must have spent hundreds of hours between the online, campaign, and skirmish modes. My friends and I played Red Alet/Red Alert 2 for about 10-15 years, until newer versions of Windows/hardware issues caused too many technical problems for us to carry on our weekly tournaments against each other. Nearly 20 years later, I accidentally stumbled across this. This game's existence makes me extremely happy.8 Bit armies is essentially Command & Conquer: Red Alert/ C&C 95 with modern touches, such as queing up units, auto production, etc. There is currently (as of April 24th) only one faction, however additional factions are promised to be released in the very near future. The game features a preview of upcoming content in the main menu. The game is still in its infancy, but it is VERY promising, and is one of the most enjoyable RTS titles I've had the pleasure of playing in recent memory.This game is not as complex as games from the Company of Heroes or Starcraft series (I currently play and love both of those franchises), but instead is a fast paced, frantic RTS with far less emphasis on micro management. It is simple enough to get anyone up and running fairly quickly (my girlfriend is not a gamer, but she was able to pick this game up and play with me within an hour), but complex enough to keep you entertained for quite some time.There is not much content at the moment, but more is supposed to arrive in the coming days/weeks, and even if it weren't there is enough here to justify the price point. For 15 bucks, you can't beat this. I'm quite excited about the 5+ factions that are upcoming!If you are looking for a relatively simple RTS experience that is fun and will run on just about any hardware, this is it. Even more so if you enjoyed the C&C/Red Alert (or OpenRA) titles. This game is fantastic, and I can't wait for the upcoming factions, maps, campaign levels, and new soundtracks!10/10, would recommend to anyone."

That essentially leaves to me to say, if you want to play Red Alert on a modern machine, you don't really have a better option.

All of the other factions are being added in the form of basically DLC, which is going to end up costing you around £30 for just the factions. Campaigns cost extra, because of course they do.Basically, if you really want to pick up a RTS for cheap, get something like dawn of war.

Very recently, a multiplayer stand-alone for this game was released called 8-Bit Armies: Arena, which costs $5 and gets you all 6 factions that have been released as of the writing of this review, though multiplayer-only, so I suggest you check that out:http://store.steampowered.com/app/5860408-Bit Armies is the latest throwback to the ""golden-age of Real-Time Strategy"" in the 90's and early 00's, back before Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas like League of Legends were a thing.  The gameplay is fairly simple: you build a base, gather resources, mass up units, and throw them at the enemy until one of you are dead.  The graphics are designed to be fairly simple to reduce the strain of the game on your PC, particularly with the army sizes the game can reach.  Since its initial launch, two other standalone games have been released, 8-Bit Hordes and 8-Bit Invaders, which are cross-compatible (meaning you can play the factions against each other), so if you care about single player you might as well get those two as well.The main thing that makes the gameplay unique is that building additional buildings provide a multiplier bonus that stacks infinitely, so while one Barracks will train an infantry unit 100% fast, five Barracks train infantry 500% quickly, ten train 1000% quickly, and so on, allowing you to grow armies to ludicrous sizes quickly.  As a consequence, though, even larger games tend to last no more than 10-15 minutes, especially as you get lots of harvesters and resources on the map run out.   In addition, random crates spawn when you destroy neutral buildings and objects, giving you effects that range from free units to healing to damaging the unit that collect it, adding a factor of randomness to your games.8-Bit Armies has a single-player campaign of 25 missions in one campaign and 15 missions in another.  The missions take place on skirmish maps though, and are essentially just skirmish battles with restricted tech trees or extra starting units/buildings.  There are a couple of stealth missions, but the majority of the campaign consists of ""destroy all enemy buildings"".  The campaigns are not scripted and there are no cutscenes, in fact the only shred of story comes from the mission briefing.  There are side objectives which provide bonus starting units as a reward, and help to spice up the otherwise monotonous campaign, but I do not recommend you get this solely for the campaign.The skirmish mode is pretty good with a decent selection of maps (and much more if you decide to get the expansions).  8-Bit supports up to eight player gameplay, and the AI is pretty good too.  Finally, with the launch of 8-Bit Armies: Arena, multiplayer is much more livelier and it's fairly easy to find someone to play with.  Replays and observer mode have also been implemented for more competitive players.The two factions you get with 8-Bit Armies are the ""Renegades"" and ""Guardians"", based loosely on the Global Defense Initiative and Brotherhood of Nod from Command and Conquer respectively (and I'll explaining the benefits of the two later).  Both factions use the power system from Command and Conquer: buildings cost power which require Power Plants to maintain: if your power requirements exceed output some buildings like defenses will stop working and others will work less efficiently.  In addition, both factions have heavy harvesters that crush enemy infantry, a radar which reveals enemies around a large radius and an offensive, powerful superweapon.-Renegades are a very direct faction (akin to GDI) that uses heavy tanks, attack helicopters, and other fairly straightforward units to steamroll the enemy.  Their units are easy to use and they have a powerful superweapon: the Tactical Nuke which destroys enemy units in a large area.  Overall, a very balanced faction that is well suited for new players.-Guardians are a sneaky, mobile faction (akin to NOD) with more specialized units such as flame tanks, stealth tanks, and suicide drones.  Their units deal area damage and are effective against clumps of units, but are weak against individual units.  Their superweapon is the Orbital Cannon, a superweapon that targets a pinpoint location and can be moved around like the USA Particle Cannon in Command and Conquer Generals.  A hard to use, but very fun faction that tends to win with a mix of finesse and swarming.In general 8-Bit Armies factions are well-suited for swarming, as their units are weaker but cheaper and faster to build.  They are also the simplest factions to learn out of the six launched (as of now).Final impressions?  8-Bit Armies is a great game if you're new to Real Time Strategy in general, as it's simple to learn but hard to master.  It's low price and quick games make it very accessible if you don't have a lot of time on your hands, and can only play a few games now and then.  I highly recommend it for both fans of older RTS games (particularly Command and Conquer) and newer gamers interested in getting into the genre."

My Only problem with the game was the AI constantly rushing which the devs fixed this recent patch by giving the AI some personalities! Which was kind of awesome!Some Ideas:- New Units; Maybe Special units for 'Factions' ? Rocket Heli's Tanks and Armored Cars are the norm to rush. Creating a Front line then back line. Granted Arty can just decimate the grouped units but I think there should be some hard counter unit to the spam.- Resources. Once you run out.... that's it, you kind of have an awkward stalemate. Or you make the guy waste his army on you then counter attack to win (it's how I've won recent games) C & C Generals had Oil Derricks: Which always generated $200 no matter what. Even if your supply ran out. You of course had your drop zones, hackers, black markets of the respected factions getting income.Since the Money Cap is much lower, you can spam freely. If it was raised, like the Nuke being 5k as other games, and give some buildings that can generate some funds periodically it can be an even better game!It can even be as simple as a fix as just giving the current oil supply a larger supply or longer for it to run out. I understand the game wants to rush action, but sometimes the game can go back and forth creating a longer game to which the game must provide the players with resources to keep it going!Maybe go back to the supply crates and use oil derricks as the steady income (such as the old Generals and Red Alert days)- Nukes: As stated above 5K seems like a good cap for the super weapon. GRANTED I love how it's set up now to only be used as a harrassing tool or Unit Clearer. It doesn't do insane dmg to buildings (4 needed to destroy HQ) but it decimates units. Since you can build multiple speeding up the time, at 4 you have about a 1 minute cool down. I think the starting timer should be 6 mins. or 5 mins, just to keep it from being too spammy.- Spam. As mentioned alot this game requires you to SPAM! My original play style was sit back, and turtle. In this game doing that may cause your death. You must be prepared to RUSH, and SPAM! With that said, it's an interesting thing to see a game WANT to make you spam units. It's by now means over powered because a well placed Nuke destroys the spam. But there should be tweaks to it.- Walls. Westwood..... come on man you know it's true.- Some form of Formation, as when units clump together since the nature of the game is SPAM, it messes up when you attack. I guess this can also be counted as a counter.- MAPS! MORE MAPS! The current maps are made excellently with a good sense of strategy needed for each map. I think once the dev's add a bunch more maps, it'll create even more re-play ability.With that said... it's an awesome game and it's only getting better. The points i've listed above are really the only main things I have with this game. I think if the dev's can incorporate at least a LITTLE of what i've mentioned this game can TRULY excel even further than it already has.I stream this game often:twitch.tv/themelvinmanIf you wanna come check it out in action! It's truly a great game to play!"

Note: there are plans to add more unique factions to the game that I will discuss near the end of my review. Enjoy :)Pro'sFantastic sound track! Phenominal work done here that fits well with the games aesthetic.(Frank Klepacki!)The aesthetic! I really love it, I think its a really cool art style for a RTS game and it gives the game its charm.Its simplicity! Don't mistake this for a bad thing, its accessible and friendly for new players; there is still a lot to like here for more experienced players but you may not find the depth when compared to something like Starcraft.The UI! Its simple, easy to read, use and understand. Should be familiar to C&C players ;)The pace! This game is well paced, its fast and yet doesn't feel overwhelming, feels perfect imo.Mechanics! Hotkeys, control groups, screen save location to jump locations with ease, shift queue orders. Great.Units! are all fun to use and all serve a purpose. You can also run over infantry with tanks and harvesters!Maps! a good map pool, some with unique elements and hazards you have to navigate such as lava.Nukes! Seriously who doesn't love launch nukes are your opponent?and now...Con'sControl Group Info. A really minor complaint. Make a control group, can't see whats in it or how many of that unit type are in the group. Easy fix and more of a quality of life improvement. :)Limited factions. At time of writing there is currently only one faction in the game. However there will be more factions added soon! Such as an undead faction with skeletons and catapults which can be seen on the games menu screen.lack of unit variety. There is a solid foundation of units but not a whole lot of variety, room for improvement here.Overall I feel there is a lot to love about 8-Bit Armies, and the developers have really nailed down the charm and gameplay. Its a bit barebones at the moment, but this is planned to change in the coming weeks/months with the addition of more factions that should all feel unique.I whole heartedly recommend 8-Bit Armies for anyone who loves RTS games or is looking to get into one.

It is essentially a clone, but with better and way more intuitive GUI and very basic core mechanics. Learning curve is so minimal I believe a child would grasp the game in no time, and control scheme is gorgeous for an RTS.Buyer beware though, like I said is a minamilst game brought foreward for the modern generation with an 8-Bit theme/tone, it isn't complex nor deep. It does look beautiful and the city scapes & terrain are those of the asthetics of Tiberium Sun mixed with differentiating levels like in Dawn of War to vary your game play & strategy (Elevations is 25% of the tactics of this game, just for an example). But the base building doesn't get very complex, as in there are not a lot of buildings to choose from. You will be building the same buildings repeatidly as it's part of the core mechanics of expansions and quicker unit generation times involved in the game.I must say, the campaign doesn't quite have the same C&C charm. Perhaps it's lacking the pixilated ultra violence, or maybe I'm just a sucker for those briefings that really set the whole theme and cut scenes that set the tone of the game back in the day.Again, if you like fast paced classic RTS's that have all the bullsh!t just ripped right off the top so you just have the core, and more so the raw micro skill assets, then this is that, but seriously don't expect an ounce more."

As 8 Bit Armies has been presented by many as a true CC style game with those classic game mechanics preserved, I was excited to give it a go. A few minutes after the game released on Steam I was already playing it.Let me first tell you, it is NOT similar on the level of  CC. It does not even come close to the same depth or polish. If CC is a fine meal in a restaurant with 3 stars in the Michelin guide, this game is a burger with fries in Mc Donalds. It will do in a pinch, but far from the real deal.One of the biggest differences is how the game constantly wants everything to happen fast. The developers advertise they want to  make the game easy and accessible, but it gives  too much pressure to finish each level as quickly as possible. You even have a limited amount of resources, if you spend too long, you deplete your resources and have no means of income. So the game you invested an hour in, yeah, that just stops and you have no way to build units and finish the game. All your units will just sit there and look dumb, so will the enemies.Rushing tacticts is the only game style that is rewarded, and to gain a three star ahievement award on each level you have to rush to the finish line within a given time. Also, many things in the game emphasizes quick reaction skills. For example, when you get a warning the enemy has launched a nuke, you only have a couple of seconds to navigate to the target site and brace your units for it. While, the AI naturally have no reaction time and can push its units away from your nuke in a millisecond. Quite annoying.Generally, this kind of approach removes much of the strategy element from the game. Forget about strategically blocking  off enemy supplies, cut off their power with a saboteur and carefully build and manage your base. Rush, rush rush to the level goals. And once you achieve it, the screen is just suddenly changed to the win screen. So, winning tactics often involves doing totally stupid suicide attacks that will destroy your own army, and would not have won the war. But because your level goal is achieved and you wont be around to see the final consequences, it does not matter. Often if feels like you are cheating, and it is also unsatisfactory to not be allowed to crush the enemy completely after the goal has been met. Age of Mythology had a great approach here, the opponent would tell you he surrenders and you could decide wether or not you will accept the surrender, then go to the win screen, or finish him off.Another thing sadly lacking in the game is any form of research and unity veterancy. The developers claim they want to make the game more accessible, but surely, unity veterancy would not make things harder for the player? I suppose, with the current rush focus, they think units would not stay around for long enugh anyway.The graphics style is quite nice, I like it. The sound effects are quite primitive, and does not have individual unity sounds, just some clicks and beeps. There is no real story in the game, except some short text note explaining what is supposedly going on on each level. But all the story mission maps are basically skirmish levels with different goals, like destroy all the Tech Labs or survive for 15 minutes.As you win each level, you are awarded some starting supplies that will stick with you for the rest of the game. So, one level might grant you a Motor Pool building permanently to all games you start from then on. As you collect more and more awards, you basically wont have to build any buildings. This supports the rushing style of the game, but personally, I find building the base and strategically maximizing how you spend resources to be a big part of what makes an RTS interesting. After a few levels, you get so many awards, you can basically just select all your freely granted army immediately and rush it into an attack and crush the enemy before the game has even begun. probably great for those with ADHD, but not so much for anyone who enjoys strategy games.Not really sure if I should give this a thumb up or down. Finally I decided to give it a thumbs up. As long as you know what you are getting into, this is a cheap, quick RTS fix. Although, the strategy element is almost gone at the expense of an arcade style gameplay. If you take it for what it is, it is quite fun at times.The game is shallow, dumbed down way more than any true fan of RTS will appreciate, is not a true tribute to the original big RTS games like CC. Much like the gameplay itself, 8 Bit Armies feels somewhat rushed."

It all just happens too fast, and there's no time, no time, no time, not to think, not to react, not to do anything but frantically click click click. There's no way to slow it down, no way to do anything to make it playable.Someone will inevitably say, ""but it has a pause!"". True, but 8-bit Armies has a hard pause, which does not allow you to do anything, or even look around while paused. I successfully played my way through all 4 campaigns in Earth 2160, but that has a soft pause. You can look around, and even give orders, within limits, while paused in Earth 2160.Great idea, the interplayability of the tech army and the fantasy army and the alien armies are great.

The main bad things to me are:Not a huge amount of content, so the game can get repetitive after a while, but the AI will usually use different units and tactics every time, and online players will nearly always use a new tactic against you.There is a very low population for this game, but there are a few online servers up round again.The only thing that really bothers me about the game, it might seem a bit petty but there's only two turrets for each faction as of now, and right now there are only two factions (if you get the guardians faction which is currently free), and only two turrets means that base defense will be hard without spamming units everywhere, and I honestly prefer having turrets as a main base defense rather than units, as they are usually more effective in these types of games.TL:DR:Great simple RTS, bit light on content and might get repetitive sometimes.At the moment, the developers are trying to constantly add more content to the game, to keep its lifespan longer.Just a note:I'm not good at reviewing things, so I may have missed a few points"

So with the more unlocks and missions you play you can go back to old missions with more unlocked and better loadouts to beat more objectives for more stuff.

Superweapons are powerful, but not overly so, and every faction has something different and interesting to try out, without being too overpowered or ridiculous.The micromanagement hell present in other RTS does not exist here. Three production queues at most (infantry/tanks/air), all in the same panel, with increased rate of production being the benefit of more factories/barracks. Resources (only one type - oil money!) go fairly quickly, which forces people to break out of their base and actually fight for the remaining stuff in the middle. Matches are usually no longer than 30 minutes, so no rage inducing 2 hr loss nonsense.The faction mixups are interesting, too! Only in this game you'll see Warcraft, Starcraft, and Command and Conquer, married up and actually being well balanced. Every faction feels different - and seeing UFOs fight Dragons is incredible.The netcode is solid, with few disconnections, and the AI is really good early game (albeit bad at late game). Picking up this game for $8 is a steal - but even at $15, you'll still find hours of enjoyment here. It's so good, and so cheap (at $8), that I was able to get all my gamer friends to play it - and they're genuinely enjoying it. We have daily matches, and I'm always surprised by new strategies that I see.I've played nearly every RTS that has ever existed, from the original Command and Conquer to Company of Heroes, and all sorts of games in between.

,Recommended,427250,22615096,"Posted: 24 April, 2016",all,Konachibi,"A bit of backstory here before talking about the game...Petroglyph is comprised of a lot of the developers that were once part of Westwood Studios, the team that brought us the ever loved Command & Conquer series.  At some point, Westwood Studios was bought by E.A, and like so many other companies before and after it, E.A attempted to run Westwood into the ground by demanding games on too short of a development time with too small of a budget and generally being the total asshats everyone knows E.A to be.Because of this, a lot of the developers at Westwood Studios left and created Petroglyph, who have since made amazing RTS games like Star Wars: Empire At War and the flawed but unique Universe At War.With 8-bit Armies, it seems Petroglyph are going back to their roots and have created a game that, other than the name, is another Command & Conquer game in the style that we prefer, rather than the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ised versions E.A keeps throwing out.  From the play style to visual design to the absolutely amazing soundtrack, it'll capture any C&C fan just like C&C: Red Alert did and offer hours of base building and army destroying fun.And that isn't even the icing on the cake, as the game's main menu teases that soon there'll be a fantasy army, complete with wizards, skeletons and all kinds of medievil miscreants.  Hopefully this will be the start of a long running game with lots of creative armies to battle one another in multiplayer.If you loved classic C&C, or real-time strategy games in general, I cannot recommend this game enough to you, it is well worth the low price they're asking for it."

You've come to the right place.So this is really a simple RTS at it's core. It doesn't force the player to learn convoluted techtrees and units hard counters. What it does it does really well instead.What you get is a campaignmode that unlocks starting bonuses and techs as you progress through the missions. Once you've unlocked a bunch you can go back to that mission you had problems with and take it on with new units and more developed starting base.Co-op is 10 missions that seems to need some balancing and polish. Hopefully there will be more.On top of that you got the expected skirmish and multiplayer modes.The negative bits does really come down to polish. A bit of misses in the interface, Some lacking feedback of what's happening. Stuff that made me think I was playing a game in early access. For example airlifting units with engineers selected is just a hassle since the engies want to repair the transport instead. The middlemouse ""mapgrap"" can't be inverted so for me it is just annoying. Nuke impacts should show on minimap until it has happened. It is a bit to quick now. No build queue, but that one I am guessing is intentional. Overall some more polish needed on unit interactions. Right now you can hold C to make them travel in grouped formation. Nice, right? Well except it should be a toggle so you can use attackmove with it.Things like that is what irritates me. I hope it all gets polished out though.Biggest negative so far is slowdowns/lag. I only played a bit of co-op with a friend and we both noticed it(wasn't hard).Is it worth it?If you like RTS games that is easy to learn but still have good room for skill. Definitely.If you like building lots of units and slowly creep over the map and just be mean to AI's. yup this is a game for you.TL:DRNeeds more polish but it is good, could be great."

The first missions are designed to master rush attacks (I'm currently in mission 8).  I didn't try network game or skirmish yet since I get enough action at the moment with this bare bone campaign. (which is unusual for me, usually I get bored quickly with campaigns).Each mission (at least until mission 8!) has a time related bonus: complete it in less than 10 minutes or so, and you get some reward for the next misssions. This is a simple and bright incentive: if you're not fast enough you're not stuck in the game, but if you understand how to rush, you get some advantage.If you like RTS C&C like, regarding the price, you don't take much risk. If you like it, it's a bargain."
76561198041204582,Recommended,427250,22660562,"Posted: 27 April, 2016",all,mattanja.bakker,"I`ve been playing 8-Bit Armies for a couple of hours now and thought this might be a good time to write an early impressions review.The bottom line is that i recommend this game for 2 reasons:1. The fact that the game uses a similar formula than the classic command & conquer RTS games, which I, being a dinosaur, am a huge fan of.2. The fact that the devs claim that they are not finished with the game and will update and add new features especially if the game is succesfull.Now that you already have my conclusion It`s time to reveal what my specific thoughts on the game are:Let`s start with the pro`s:1. Easy to learn and get into2. Almost the same User Interface as in RA2 with the table to order units and buildings on the right as well as the amount of resources shown on the top right.3. Very polished game, personally i have not encountered any bugs, crashes or lag. The units respond immediately to commands.4. Destructible environments such as trees, houses etc.5. Faster unit production if one has more than one of the same buildings (e.g. 2x barracks=faster production)6. campaign containing 25 missions.7. Multiplayer as well as a coop campaign.8. one type of resource (oil).9. Reward system in the campaign. Every mission contains three objectives, which offer rewards that the player can use the next time he plays a campaign mission. These are rewards like extra tanks at the start of a mission, extra cash or buildings etc. These bonusses are used even if one replays a former mission. This gives the replayability a huge boost in my opinion.10. I do like the art style.11. Superweapons exist, but they are a lot less powerful.12. There is no limit in ordering units (at least i haven`t found one). Previous classic RTS had building queue limits such as 1, 30 or 9.13. The random boxes make a return, though this time they only contain standard units.So Now the Con`s:1. As of the time I posted this review there is only 1 playable faction and the campaign enemy is the same faction. To my understanding the devs are already working on more factions but I think it is necessary that potential buyers now this. Hopefully those new factions aren`t simply a reskin but add some variety as well as intuitive gameplay.2. The resource gatherers/harvesters AI behaves very stupidly. Mostly they want to unload their cargo at one refinery although i have another right next to it. This means that i get money less quickly than i could. And/Or they all move to the same oild deposit on the map which creates a waiting line instead of dividing themselves up. You can give them orders to change their behaviour but it is still annoying to me. Furthermore if you assign them to a specific refinery they will still go to the deposit they were initially going to, which sometimes creates a much longer path than is necessary.3. The distinction between the line of sight and fog of war is too vague. Sometimes I am not sure if there are no enemies in that area or if i actually need to move my units closer.4. The radar circle, revealing enemies is always centered around the HQ and not the radar building. If it were centered on the latter the circle could be placed in more advantageous positions.5. There is only a limited number of different units and buildings. There are three types of infantry, three of vehicles and three types of chopper.6. There are no stealth units.7. There is only a limited amount of maps (only 2 1v1 maps for example) and some of them are re-used during the campaign. A level/map editor would go a long way in  adding lifetime and fun to the game.8.The maps themselves are quite small. Though it does add to the speed of the matches I would like some longer maps with the possibility to have/build secondary bases.9. The Hq itself is immobile, almost all buildings are build at the main base.10. There are no naval units. Though this is not necessarily a must, it would be cool to have some longer maps with a significant amount of water.11. The only way to get cash are the oil deposits. Other classic RTS offer the possibility to capture buildings such as banks, or build moneyproducing buildings or units in the base.12. One is only allowed to build one building or defensive turret at a time. It would be nice if the normal buidings and defensive structures have a seperate building queue.13. More defensive structures such as walls and mines could be added.14. There is no progression during multiplayer (such as earning points to call in airstrikes and the like).15. Normal buildings are destructable but it is not possible to use them as cover for infantry. Unlike in classic RTS infantry cannot enter buildings.16. It is not possible to steal buildings (though I am not a 100% sure about that)Again overall the game is polished and looks very promising. New features and factions will be added so this is really only a first impressions review. I hope that the devs not only match the classic RTS games but will also surpass them with this game by using some new and intuitive features and gameplay elements."

However, the music is fantastic. Frank K knows what he is doing. The missions seemed more like skirmishes than actual missions - none of the objectives were particularly novel or interesting. None of the units felt very powerful to me - the game seems to be more about ""macro"" than intense strategy. The most useful strategy for the majority of games for me was to simply build towers all the way to the opponent's base. They seemed to be the only structure/unit that could clearly hold their own. Otherwise, my units died as quickly as I could build them. The pinnacle of RTS for me was Red Alert 2, to provide this review some context. That game is fun, silly, and hilarious.

There are no characters or dialogue in the game so don't expect an even vaguely interesting story. But even without story the missions are still fun to play through and while the strategy is relatively simple, it can still be difficult to complete the bonus challenges on each mission on hard difficulty (the third challenge always being a time limit). The soundtrack is great and very reminiscent of C&C/Red alert (It's the same artist; Frank Klepacki) so I recommend getting the soundtrack edition if you like to listen to game music outside of the game.

Sadly not yet in this state.But i do believe it will improve over time.Because lets be honest there is not a single aspect that this game has better then any of the old titles we loved?Apart from it beeing different.Less content. and based on the old series. I enjoyed as i enjoy this game mostly.

Which makes it very hard and very unfair towards the player. Me and a friend did co op and within 2 minutes i got nuked and had all the teams hit me. The balancing for AI (keep in mind i tried it on the easiest and still got my♥♥♥♥♥handed to me) needs a major overhaulThe balance in terms of troops is insaneA tank ONE TANK can run over an entire army of troops. and helicopters are op as all hellAlso when they start with multiple tanks and i start with little to nothing (and on some maps you dont even GET tanks) the AI is stacked against you hardExplosives only damage structures really, bullets only damage troops. I mean they do damage others but they are mainly made for that, which further adds to the frustration. If a soldier with a rocket launcher cant kill a gunman that makes no sense but whateverOverall the AI and balance is trash and i advise you do not get thisAlso check my screenshots and see how many troops the AI gets compared to us, keep in mind the game lasted like under 5 minutes. The AI basically started with 100 troops. I started with like 10 maybe. When 100 troops per AI, and all 6 or so AI attack you at once, you dont stand a damn chance"

I remember when Command and Conquer was new - and I was so upset! As upset as a 4-5 year old can get, anyway. I wanted more Dune. I got C&CI opened up the first GDI mission to an actual guy, video of an actual dude talking to me, telling me about the mission. It was the first time I'd ever heard actual sound effects and music, the first time I'd seen video in the game. The videos were memorable, the characters were brilliantly cheesy. I absolutely loved the series. Then EA killed it off brutally, ending any hope of a continuation of a series my parents, my brother, and I all played and loved.I saw Petroglyph form years ago, and I'd been hoping for a reboot of that same zany spark that made the C&C series so great. When a friend pointed this game out to me mid-semester I was strapped for cash. I saw the Petroglyph name on it and bought it at the cost of skipping several meals. I didn't play it until recently.I got my younger brother to buy it, we opened it up. The title screen came on. It was definitely Frank Klepacki's style - we both got psyched. We opened up the coop campaign screen. I saw that there was a brief mission description on each map - and that they were all unlocked - but I thought nothing of it. We hit the 'start button' and...Nothing. No video briefing.Okay. So we decide to play. We'd selected 'normal' because we're both RTS veterans. We built our harvesters and noticed something else...resources are limited and non-regenerating.I clicked around several times. Why weren't my infantry acknowledging me? No ""Yes sir!"" or even distinct sound effects, no 'buzz' like the Scrin nor even a beeping classic Dune 2 style.About 5 minutes in, we get rushed by the AI, who brings a continuous stream of vehicles and multiple different types of infantry into the first mission. We get destroyed - we have no vehicles ourselves and we were told not to build rocket infantry for the first 'bonus objective', which I interpretted to mean something like bonus units - Emperor: Battle For Dune style - or something of the like.Wow. So we go again. The AI shifts strategies. They're silent for most of the first part of the mission and then BAM a massive amount of them hit all at once. Okay. We restart one more time.This time we decide to rush the AI. I decide to try an old RA2-era style economic choke hold and sneak my troops down a route the AI is loathe to use. I get my army sitting around waiting for their harvesters and boom. Erase their harvester from existence.Then another one comes within half a minute. And another. Then another. Endlessly. This wouldn't be a problem except for the harvesters knocking down infantry en masse and the infantry tending to chase the harvesters, putting them directly in their path. Fantastic. So I send enough infantry down to just zap the harvesters from existence for a bit.The AI doesn't respond to that. They let me sit there and run them completely out of resources. They run a massive army back and forth between a pre-set rally point in the first map (for player 2, check the NW corner) and leave me to my own devices.In the next several missions we noticed a pattern: We lost the ability to produce certain units crucial to countering the AI. For example, one mission gives us infantry and transport helicopters. The AI comes in with artillery, anti-air and anti-ground helicopters.It ends up being one of the most obnoxious, boring, bland RTSes we've ever played.Also, for the co-op campaign, it's all one faction. The AI have the exact same roster you do - they just get much more of it.TL;DR:-This game has less storyline than Dune 2 from the early 90s/MS-DOS era.-This game has less unit variety among factions than Dune 2.-This game has less map variety than Dune 2.-This game has less engaging music than Dune 2.-This game has no video briefings, no real briefings, no dynamic events in map (""Commander, NOD forces are bringing in the pain from the northeast. Battlefield expanded""), no regenerative resources. It's like if Tiberian Dawn was stripped of its personality and made into an e-sport.Verdict:-You might be better served by playing C&C 4 for a co-op RTS campaign than this.-You'll definitely enjoy Dawn of War 2's co-op campaigns better than this.-The DoW series is MUCH more enjoyable than this, now that I mention it.-Skip this. Petroglyph's made up of a team that can do and has done FAR better than this."

But in the few cases I jump on it's a lot of fun to experiment with countering the current strategies.However, with that said I'd also like to mention the fact that the A.I using a single, brutal-against-newer-players strategy, which involves constant steamrolling and steamrolling, throwing a few units at a time at the enemy base to occupy them, and then when you build an army up they mass together a big ball ofaircraft, anti infantry, and anti ground and steamroll your army, then steamroll your base, I've seen it happen.  It's even happened to me, and I haven't been able to counter it.  Which brings me onto another point:  There needs to be a better way of expanding.  I find myself stuck on 1 base and then long distance mining because it's so expensive to expand, I really don't think building a daisy chain of buildings to the next oil derrick is a good idea.  I'm not going to say make it so that you can build anywhere without limit, since that can turn into a whole lot of balancing issues.  No, what I'm saying is simpler.  Give us back the Surveyor. (and nod/scrin's equivilant.) Surveyor should be unlocked either with the motor pool, barracks, or the tech lab.  The Surveyor should have the ability to unpack into a mini HQ, which you can build near, simple right?  Makes expanding cheaper and more avaliable.

76561198033719090,Not Recommended,427250,22624373,"Posted: 24 April, 2016",all,SgtRicko,"Short Version:  Wait until some DLC or expansions come along.  Because while it's not a bad game in itself, it's extremely basic and barebones.Long Version:  If you've played the original Command & Conquer (Tiberian Dawn), then you've already got a strong idea of how this game is going to play - only that it's somehow even more simplistic and straightforward.  You've got your base, a resource to collect (oil) along with a harvester to reach it, power plants, a couple of base defense structures, production structures, infantry, tanks, a recon jeep, choppers, artillery, and a nuke as a superweapon.  That's it.  No subfactions, no support powers, no secondary unit abilities, buffs, or specials, no garrisonable structures, or anything else that's fancy.  It's the kind of RTS that you could probably use to introduce your kids or young relatives into the genre, but even they'll pick up the mechanics pretty quickly.  In all likelihood, you've played something more complex.The campaign has a bit of length (roughly 30 missions) and does encourage replayability via secondary objectives with rewards that can only be achieved with later playthroughs.  The reason being is that some of the objectives just aren't possible without the later units being unlocked.  And whenever those secondary objectives are completeld, they either unlock additional starting units for that mission, more starting credits, or a new unit to use at the beginning of that particular mission.  That later point is kinda moot though, especially since beating all of the mission's objectives invalidates the usefulness of those extra starting items...The one big positive is the multiplayer.  In addition to a co-op campaign with it's own set of secondary objectives (this time for achievement purposes only though, no unlocks), you've got 10 skirmish/multiplayer maps with some that can host up to 8 players.  So if you've been missing the massive swarms of tanks and joint bases that sometimes occured when playing the older C&C titles on the bigger maps, you'll definitely get that fix here.Finally, the devs have mentioned that they will release a second ""Medieval Fantasy"" themed faction at some point in the future, but no official date has been given.  Oh, and they might also release something for the modding community (an SDK, perhaps?) but again, no official date or word has been given."

I had a fun time playing the first couple missions, as they were 'doable' but the game became very quickly and unimaginably more difficult & challenging shortly thereafter (as in, the AI seemed to have limitless amounts of money, would start the game with a fully built base & seemed to have an endless supply of relentlessly aggressive troops, jeeps, and tanks.)Either way, I feel like this game has the potential to be an awesome game that I would love to play more of, but the issues I have with the game are far too frustrating for me to give the game anymore of my time, effort, or energy.

,Recommended,427250,22851667,"Posted: 7 May, 2016",all,yourwolfsdengaming,"--------- This Review Is Courtesy Of Yourwolfsdengaming ---------- Purchased Copy -From what we’ve gathered with our magical and mystical ability of staring at the Steam Store page, there’s 25 offline campaign missions, 12 co-op missions, 10 multiplayer maps, and 1 faction.Sorry, one? We mean, we know it’s more focused on people who are getting into RTS games, but one faction on launch?As for the gameplay, it’s your fairly typical lot, except dumbed down. It’s Command and conquer in almost every aspect, but even on release, the first Command and Conquer was a fairly simple game to get into, and just a hard game to master. 8 Bit Armies has mostly thrown out the ‘hard game to master’ bit, and given you the rest. Which sounds great! Meaning, there’s a whole campaign, skirmish against AI, multiplayer, what’s wrong? For one, they did everything wrong Command and Conquer did wrong, and a lot more. For starters, the campaign is weak. Unlike in the superior sequel Red Alert, there’s no cutscenes in the campaign. You select your level, some text appears, you have some side objectives which are almost impossible for said new people the game is trying to get into, you have a few (and we mean a few) difficulty options, and then they’re off. It plays almost identical in every way to just a shorter skirmish match, side goals are either impossible for the ‘beginner’ player audience it’s trying to advertise to, or they can just be done along with the main goal which makes them pointless, and because there are no factions, no story, and no cutscenes at all, it’s just skirmish mode with objectives thrown in. The campaign isn’t fun, it’s boring. We started playing, got through six missions and quit. The bonus objectives are cool, and would help make any other campaign more replayable, especially since they give you bonus things that stack on to your next loadout for the next mission, but it can’t make it replayable if it’s just tedious to play. Skirmish mode made the campaign obsolete.Add these problems up, and you have an unneeded campaign.Skirmish mode is up next, and it’s about what you expect. Again, you have only one faction. As such in skirmish, every faction plays the same, because they are all indeed playing the same faction. You have 10 maps to choose from, the color of the AI, and their difficulty. You have a few different ‘versions’ of skirmish mode available by changing the very few rules, but we really wish there were more game modes, because as is, there’s only ever one game mode, which is deathmatch/team deathmatch. This would be ‘okay’ if there were more than one faction, and the factions had different units and played differently, but they don’t because we only ever have one faction, and there’s only ever one strategy to use. There’s also a problem of the AI. The AI is simple, and (even with an update fixing this issue) the AI still somehow rush and manage an army I’ve never even seen in multiplayer by 2:30 into a match. The problem is that the AI will rush in the beginning with the same units you can defend with, and because turrets both are horrible and have the range of Nerf guns, it just comes down to ‘who has more of x units that happen to counter y units’. The game is a big fan of counter units, but because air units have more mobility and have anti-infantry/anti-vehicle versions, players could just build an army of air units without a second thought. The AI is overly simple, and if they don’t rush, end up being way too easy to beat. The game is enjoyable, but I’m not sure if it’s because the game itself is good, or if it’s because it just took good things other games also did well. Outside of the good elements it took from Command and Conquer, we’re really not sure what it has as an identity, and that worries us about its future. Because there’s so few units or unique types of units/buildings, it comes off as feeling rather generic.As for multiplayer, it exists. We tried 15 total games, and 12 of those 15 games just got canceled after waiting in a lobby with other players for 10 minutes. No, we don’t have the time for that. It’s nice it exists, but the game needs matchmaking, because we spent far longer in the menus just waiting for something to happen, the game to start, players to join, or for those in our game to decide what kind of game we should have. It has a feel of being incomplete, and why these options you as a host can’t set BEFORE you open the match to players baffles us. You also have an in-game text chat function. It works fine, but three of the possible colors in the game are really hard to see in the chat. The chat has a faded black background, and our font was black because the team color we had was black. You can figure out how well that went trying to read dark black and a slightly lighter dark black backdrop.Visually, it looks okay. It’s nothing special, but it gets the job done. We’d say more, but they really don’t do enough with the lighting so we can see what the game is fully capable of, and almost all the maps take place in the equivalency of ‘day’, so it’s hard to judge it. Characteristically, it looks rather bland, and everything from the maps to the units looks generic. This would be okay if there were other factions, or indeed something else there as a contrast, but there’s not. The game runs really well as a plus, and we don’t doubt it probably being able to run on integrated graphics just fine.For the audio, the game sounds great. The music was really nice, but the audio effects weren’t really interesting enough or impressive, but it all fit well and sounded defined.It’s okay, but we wonder if it’s okay because the actual game is good, or because it took nearly everything that made the Command and Conquer games good, because everything it tries to do comes off as either unfinished or boring. Teasing us with a faction that’s not even out yet is nice, but the game needed more than one faction on release.It’s hard to suggest because it just feels so incomplete. There’s a lot of really cool game elements here, but most of the things we enjoyed in 8 Bit Armies were just things we also enjoyed in Command and Conquer, and 8 Bit Armies store page certainly isn’t shy about telling us who’s skin it’s wearing. The problem is that everything the game tries to do itself that isn’t just something you could copy easily, it doesn’t do it well. Multiplayer is boring with just one faction with cookie-cutter units, campaign without a story is just the skirmish mode, and the skirmish mode is too shallow with not enough to do. The game is fun in short bursts, but certainly not for the long hall, and we’ll suggest thing game only under the guise that you as a player wait at the very least until the magic faction they tease gets released. The game is a generic RTS for now, take that for what it is, and we hope that it gets better as time goes on.PROS- The music is amazing, and the sound effects aren't half bad- fair level of settings to adjust the game, and the game controls wellCONS- Everything feels so generic and bland- Nothing in the game has it's own style, and we wonder if it will hold a playerbase a year after its release- The campaign is boring, the multiplayer is limited without matchmaking, and the skirmish and unit options are shallowScore: 6.8/10--------------------------------------------------------------This is our full review for the game, the only difference between the Steam review and the one on our website, is we have pictures and text is easier to read and what not.

The game feels quick with short menus, no cut scenes, and a small set of units and buildings. It runs smoothly on my mid-spec computer and stuff blows up mighty good. There's a generous campaign but not a lot of maps at the moment. There are also skirmish, multiplayer, and co-op modes. Petroglyph (the developer) keeps improving the game and fixing bugs with updates and they've said more armies are on the way plus mod/map tools.

For first timers or comers I would suggest this title. Otherwise for strategic gameplay it won't match up to the levels of Starcraft. Comparing to the older versions of C&C is following along the same lines as massing up large amounts of units and ball them up into attacks.While the older C&C titles followed suit into this (Exception being RA in the production issue) there is an open source mod known as OpenRA which has a lot of the balance fixes rather then making large quantity of units to ball up and steam roll.8-bit Armies is a good experience but I wouldn't take this as the step to doing competitive gaming."

The controls and mechanics are super simple, so simple that someone like me, who doesn't know a whole lot about RTS games can learn it and play it within 2 hours. (I did put hours into the demo, which may or may not show up) The graphics aren't complex, but they don't have to be. And the A.I. is decent considering the game itself.The issue comes here: it's a little too simple.Let me explain. The game is meant to be simple, and it is. The missions, on the other hand, get to be repetitive. There is only so much you can do before everything feels the same. It becomes more ""Who can build the most units first"" rather than ""What's the best strategy to use."" The simplicity begins to take away from the ""S"" in ""RTS.""  Multiplayer was similar. Now, for all I know, the further you advance in the game, the more complexd it becomes. But after 2 hours in the demo and another hour in the actual game (keeping in mind that the demo was just the first 5 missions and they carried over), I felt like I was getting nowhere, even though I was ""progressing.""So yeah, the game has potential, but if you're looking  for an RTS you can dive into quickly, be warned. There will be plenty who will enjoy the game, and I believe them. It just isn't the style many I know would enjoy.TL;DR The game's oversimplicity takes away from its other great features."

,Not Recommended,427250,28085717,"Posted: 29 November, 2016",all,Oshers,"I want to give this game a good review, I really do. It has a lot of potential for what it's worth, but... let me point out some key things you should know.First of all, this is an RTS game, but it doesn't have the essentials most RTS games share. It falls flat in a lot of aspects that make a good RTS game. There's no upgrades whatsoever for units or structures, you place them down and that's it. You do have to place certain buildings to unlock other units or buildings, but you can't make your troops stronger, more agile, have more abilities, or anything more in depth than that. And with a limited roster of units and buildings, the game really suffers from this aspect.Secondly, if you're expecting a long game, then look elsewhere, this game is really short. I only played about half the missions in, but a lot of them can easily be completed in 5-10 minutes, which is fine for some people that want to just hop in and play quickly, but for me, I like to take my time and strategise a plan, then attack, whereas in this game, you have the enemy raiding your base with a sizable army in the first 5-10 minutes. Same with the skirmish mode, you start up and on even easy mode, you are met with the enemy's forces within a few short minutes, before you have time to build up a large army of your own. Now I'm not saying that the game is broken, as in, the enemy shows up when you can't build that quick, you can build that quick, and actually have to build that quick or else you're screwed. I personally like longer games that can take upwards of hours sometimes, but this game forces you to build quick and early and end the game every time in under 15 minutes.On top of all this, the game doesn't run very well. Now I'm not claiming to have any sort of super computer or anything like that, but even a game this small that looks as blocky as this should not run bad at all. It's fine for the inital stages, but I tried to break the formula of the quick gameplay and build up a large army to go raid each of the enemies one by one, but the game really starts to not like it when you get something like 50+ units on screen. It can drop frames, have weird shadow glitches, and I even had a time where it deselected half my units when I scrolled the map too fast.Another few minor gripes as well. Naturally, there are faster units than others in the game, but when they all travel in a pack, the faster units just zoom on ahead and leave my heavy untis without any frontward protection. In other RTS games, if you have a group sent out, they all sync up and move together, even in formation too, but here, you have your fast, machinegun mounted trucks zipping well ahead of your tanks at the back, and infantry somewhere in between in the very strategic ""line"" formation... Also, the battery power your base runs on seems somewhat pointless to me as well. If you go over the battery limit, the only thing that seems to shut down is the turrets, my vehicle depots, and rescource collestiors all still worked completely fine, so maybe it's just me, but I think it's kind of useless. And one final thing... you cannot build more than one home HQ. In typical RTS games, you can discover new areas of the map and maybe find defensible locations to settle a secondary, or even tertiary base, but in this game, you are only allowed ONE HQ at any given time, if it blows up, you can build another one, so long as you still have a rescource plant and/or units to survive on, but really? Only one..? It's not like it matters anyway though, cause by the time you send out units to scout a location for a base, you'll be hounded by notifications that your home base is under attack within minutes.It is a decent little game if you're looking for a couple hours of enjoyment, and maybe you're into the faster paced, simple gameplay, but without further updates that add more things to do, and potentially even increase battle time, I personally cannot recommend this product."

What I say is that this is a good stradegy game.PROS:Simple enough that new players can learn, but complex enough that it takes skill to win the matchResources are limited on the map, so that means you are FORCED to fight eventually, meaning that eternal stalemates are not possible, because one side will be forced to fight eventuallyThe A.I is actually excellent in this game. This is because the Insane difficulty lives up to its nameThis game allows for many playstyles, some players prefer to produce more tanks, some want more infantry, some want more air units. This game supports many playstyles, although, reamember, not all play styles are goodCONS:The A.I has one flaw: ICBM spam. If the A.I has obtained an ICBM silo, the moment it can use an ICBM, it will. This means that in some matches the A.I will just spam ICBM's towards your base and it can get agitating to have to constanltly repair and replace your buildings and units. This feature may be for challenge, but this is just not very logical. Most players will save their ICBM for important situations. Not for spamming at someone's base"

You will have the mind set when you get this game that its going to be a very simple game, and it is don't get me wrong. The attention to detail in this game blew me away despite how simple I thought it was going to be. The game is absolutely beautiful and the maps just blew my mind. Also this is a easy rts game to get into, but its not dumbed down so much to where there is only spam strategy. You can do some pretty cheesy things in this game to your opponents even though there are not a lot of units and the game is VERY fast paced. The AI in this game so far is actually the smartest AI I've played against in a rts game. They know when to retreat, when to re-inforce, when to defend, how to flank, and how to counter unit spam (they will nuke all of your dudes bruh). The soundtrack is amazing Frank Klepacki made the music for the game and its very fitting for its style. If you have been waiting for Command & Conquer to rise from the ashes this may be the start of it. This game SCREAMS C&C at me. And it pretty much is C&C just reskinned. Great game and its great fun especially for the price. There are some very minor bugs however, sometimes the AI will get stuck when they are prepairing to load units into transport helis and will just sit in their base, and joining a lobby sometimes doesn't work unless you have the host kick you so you can rejoin, but it rarely happens and Petroglyph has been fixing the launch day issues anyways so by the time you read this review it might already be fixed."

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings."

On its release, the game has a few issues such as the bad campaign, the spammy ai, the defective units and multiplayer issues.Thing is that the units aren't that good. I felt that they were weak. The main infantry, is a machine gunner. It doesn't really work that way. Rocket men are just so weak that you need to spawn a blob of them to take out 2 jeeps.""Blobbing"" is the only way to win (Blobbing is creating an army that is so big that it can be seen from the radar btw).Don't worry, if you bought this game, don't uninstall and refund. The community should be able to help this game be stable as it is in its first days of release.Do i recommend it? Yes but if the game is stable enough.

,Recommended,427250,22634898,"Posted: 25 April, 2016",all,W.A. the Anum,"Welcome back, Commander.8-Bit Armies is a old-school like RTS game ala Command and Conquer. The game plays mostly (if not also only) with the mouse next to some special ""orders"" for the units like guard, patrol and co. The Voxel grafic fits anyhow perfectly to the gameplay and it actually makes some kind of fun coz of that.If this will not help, make a mass-attack!So far 8-Bit Armies misses a bit of content like special units or other factions (as i wrote the review, only one faction). The units are, so far, nothing special and it gives only 2 kinds of them: Rockets or MG. The only specials are the tank and artillery which are somewhere between.The lack of contentThe campaign has 25 missions where you can do 3 ""Stars"" (Missions) to upgrate your Base with basic gear like more units from the beginning, more money, buldings or like. The main problem is that the whole game has only 10 maps to offer and the full campaign has not even any special/own map. they all re-use very often the maps over and over in the campaign and the Missions are mostly like thatthe first (and main) Mission in one stage is mostly-Destroy HQ-Destroy a special number of Buldings-Survive X minutesthe second Mission in one stage is mostly-Destroy HQ (if you have to survive mostly)-Dont train X unitsThe third and last Mission in one stage is mostly-Do mission 1 and 2 in X minutesSo as you can see, it lacks in varity unlike old RTS like C&C or Starcraft. The campaign is more or less like or feels like bashed missions on multiplayer maps - which they indeed are.All 10 Maps -are- multiplayer maps. You can use them for Multiplayer and  are also used in the Coop- and main campaign, we are still talking about the same 10 Maps. So thats actually a pretty weird concept and the player will feel that pretty quickly - i mean if the game has 25 Missions and only 10 Maps, you can think how often you play one map at least.The ""re-playable"" campaign is a joke.Back to the missions, they said it is ""re-playable"" since if you got all stars your base will build up/upgrate from the very beginning of each mission. The problem is that it is sometimes impossible to get all 3 stars by the first try since you need to get the unit-upgrate from another mission later. So you actually have to play a lot missions twice to unlock all - and some stuff do you need since it will be harder in the later game.Is it still worth it?Fans and friends from old school RTS will sure enjoy it but will miss quickly the content or concept. Since the game offers so far only 10 maps with 25 Bashed-on-campaign missions with over and over kinda the same to do, it will more end up in ""i just play a round"" - and since the last Star in one mission is mostly like ""Do everything in X minutes"", rushes the game very very hard. I loved to play C&C to see my units and Base grow and going into battle, in 8-Bit armies it feels like ""I HAVE TO CLICK LIKE HELL TO BUILD MORE UNITS NOOAAWW!!!"" which ruins a bit the gameplay. Next to this are only one faction and not any ""special"" unit or like (so far) in this game.So it sure is nice and i would give it barely a6 out of 10since it is still enjoyable (and the 15$ price mark). People who want more should maybe think twice about to buy it at least if its not some %off.The devs already said they will update the game with new maps and what not, which maybe changes my review in the future but more i hope it will help the game grow and make it more fun to play since the multiplayer also needs a lil update since it works clunky and a bit laggy."

But my hype was let down after playing the game for a bit. The game just feels shallow and made for people who are brand new to RTS games, as in have never played an RTS before, but for players like myself who played tons of Red Alert 2 it lacked alot of depth and unit variety. The game is very simple and at the time of writting there is one faction, a couple units and a handfull of buildings. There are no base expansion mechanics, a small pool of maps. and the strategy is lacking, with a good tactic being just build a crapload of units and zerg rush the enemy with not much in the way of defensive options. I found the art style all right and the music is great but the lack of depth and vareity is what really hampered my experience. Overall I felt let down. To be fair my expectaions might have been too high as I was hoping for a game similar to Red Alert 2 but alas this is not that. It's fun, but very basic which if that is what you are looking for than go right ahead, but for me I just wanted a bit more."

I'm not asking for a freely rotatable camera which would require more work and potentially introduce lag, I'm just asking for the ability to rotate the camera in a limited fashion, because only being able to look from one angle is annoying, and the introduction of limited rotatability would be relatively easy plus if people don't like it they don't have to use it, the same goes for north,south,east,west building rotation. Give the player the CHOICE, if they want to use these standard functions all 3D RTS games should come with. Once these features are introduced i would happily recommend this game."

The same company that brought us Star Wars: Empire at War, battle battalions, and Grey Goo. Now right off the bat, I thought I wasn’t going to enjoy this game. The reason why was because I grew up in the 90’s. I am one of those older guys who played 8-bit games when they were the standard and typically don’t like going back to that aesthetic. I also don’t like Minecraft for the same reason. So I really didn’t have high hopes for this game going in to it and Boy was I surprised! This game is done very much in the old Command and Conquer style with modern 8-bit graphics and mechanics. I found myself sinking immediately back into old habits as the control schemes and unit types were immediately familiar.8-Bit Armies is a very good RTS and a nice reminder of how the genre used to be. Easily worth the $15 asking price whether you have never played RTS’s before or are an enthusiast.""See my full Critique here:https://youtu.be/BY5staYSHNw"

I NOD in your direction Petroglyph  for making this hommage to the old CNC games up to Yuri's Revenge. ♥♥♥♥ing EA, what a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.If you like explosions and creating swarms of tankie death and quick to pick up and play, then the is the game for you. Not everyone wants to have a game where they spend the best part of a year trying to craft the perfect amry for world domination. Which is what I like about this game, that I can jump in play a few missions or skirmishes and be satisfied. If you are a hardcore RTS player then you will not enjoy this game, but still you should try it, espcially if it goes on sale.The only downside to the game I find is the lack of indiviuallity with both armies, as you can play them in pretty much the same way. It does help facilitate the quickness of being able to jump into a match and made things explode. It would be kool if they put their creative caps on and try to define he armies some more.Its great that you can still build your own maps like you could in CNC, but it is much easier to get your head around. It would be nice to know if the developers are looking at having a unit creator to become available. I can understand why its not there as one person out there will only end up making something OP and cheap. The way around this maybe, is to allow the player to create 1  special unit that can be added to a custom army (which could also have an emblem for the army as well) and classed as a type of Flagship or Leader, like you see in other RTS's.The soundtrack will bring back many memories of the scores from CNC, what more do you want?The things I would like to see from the game, is more armies being added (I want a Mech Army, please make this happen!) more unique unit types for each army. I like to belive they will be adding Naval units, but if not, why not?!! There is water in the game and it just makes sense to have all of that. Imagine a whole map dedicated to naval warfare. <-----Make this happen as well. I know, I know, these types of things are alredy on the developers to do list (mayeb not the Mech part, I really want them to make that happen)  but if you can give us some sneak peaks on what you have planned for the game that wouyld be great.Maybe have a bio-organic army, like I am talking Jayce and The Wheeled Warrior style enemies, how kool will that be to fight! I would tottaly pay for that!So if Petroglyph  is reading this, I hope you are listening to what the fans want as there was a whole generatrion of us who loved what you did when you were Westwood!P.S.Like if there are plans for a Mech Army, please send me a message on steam ;)"

There is no real strategy here except flood units. no real tactic needed, build buildings, go forward with swarm, kill enemy swarm, repeat. maps are tiny and influence this play style heavily. however that being said, it does stick to the original formula westwood put out so many years ago, and it can be fun in short bursts, which is something i shouldn't be able to say about an rts, but its there.Unit Variety is lack luster, with no real point to spam anything but heavy tanks and heavy helos. youll spend most of your 4 minutes in a multiplayer match speeding through building your buildings while simulataneously spamming these two units. Then sending your swarm forward to steam roll everything.If you play alone youll want to spam early on and destroy the initial AI army, then just destroy their harvesters as they leave the enemy base and build an army of your own, which is dull and repetitive to say the least. Though at first the enemy AI will curb stomp you because even on easy they are little tyrants. Spamming their units at super computer speeds you cant keep up with, initially.However there are other units like artilary and the like, that do area damage at a decent fire rate, but the damage they do merely isnt enough to defeat a heavy swarm or offer any real hinderence, then the enemy swarm rushes them and they are wiped out. Perhaps if these things are buffed than maybe the game will balance itself out and allow for more thinking to take over.In its current state, it's not so much a strategy game as much as it is a swarm simulator. Though it does have a nostalgic feel, and an easy to understand UI, it just doesn't feel...Strategic.3/5"

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings."

Anyone can learn a more complex strategy game if they simply put in the time. Multiplayer is a fun and tense experience, if you find any matches. If you enjoy playing against AI, like me, then you'll more than likely be dissapointed.I feel like the AI is very shallow and thoughtless. Hard AI whips up a base and has enemies on you before you as a human player can so much as build your first turret or have your vehicles out. Its more about overwhelming numbers for the AI, whilst building the most scatter-brained base defenses. If you try some smart tactics like sneak in from the back, most often you'll see the ai units aimlessly standing around. They'll only move to defend their base if you get too close. AI, like with all C&C games, will almost always take the same generic path through a map. This allows countering even Insane level AI by setting up a heavy defence at their expected route.One of the skirmishes i played was assasinate. The AI superunits simply acted as glorified infantry taking on an assault on its own. With its underpowered rifle, it would only makes sense they'd try to keep it safe, not the first line of defense. Needless to say, i wiped the AI  without ever seeing their base, and to top it off, an ally of mine decides to nuke  the area of a recently defeated AI base.Really I want to love this game but the single player aspect is all i really care for, and the AI is just not smart. If the AI gets some improvements, this would be a much better game for offline play. I would love to see AI behaviors, such as turtles or steamrollers found in C&C Generals. A emphasis on exploiting player weaknesses or openings aside from brute unit steamrolling would make offline play much better.If you don't get the game, i would definetely recommend the soundtracks. Frank Klepacki has made an astonishingly beautiful set of tracks for this game, as he has for all of the original Westwood developed C&C titles."
