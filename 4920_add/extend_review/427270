Glad that I did, its has everything going for it. The gameplay is supersmooth, it runs really well. The trapping is really fun, and the heroes are cool and unique with fun abilities. Its easy to play, but hard to master. Its addicting to try different sort of trap setups to stop the orcs from getting through. The progression system has room for some improvement, but for a free game I was totally taken by surprise with this one."

,Not Recommended,427270,29756773,Posted: 6 February,all,Supernatural Cookie,"I want to preface this by saying I absolutely love the OMD series. I've recommended the first two games to pretty much everyone I know and then some. So when I have to say I don't recommend this, it saddens me quite a bit.This game feels like, as a friend of mine put it, a chinese knock off of OMD. The game feels far more shallow and bland than the original two games, and as far as polish goes, it feels like the project of someone who never made a game before in their life.Visually and musically, it looks and sounds great. But when it comes down to the actual gameplay, its like they stripped everything fun or strategic from the game. Now you need to upgrade your traps by collecting hundreds of copies of them to increase their stats minutely. Weapon variety has gone completely out the window, instead replaced by several different characters. Weapons which used to offer different gameplay now are just activatable passive buffs to damage now from what I can tell. Also it seems like headshots are gone? Attacks feel generally weaker, and for some reason theres both a cooldown and mana cost associated to secondary abilities. Which wouldn't be bad, but it seems like the abilities themselves have such a long cooldown that for some characters you couldn't hope to drain your mana enough to ever get down to even half.I will say that the game isn't terrible. Its playable for certain, but it feels incredibly bland and lifeless compared to the other entries. If you absolutely must play a game like this, there are better options. Smite if you want a more PVP focused game, even Dungeon Defenders 2 is a slightly better PVE experience, though not by much.Also, for a game thats been in development for what? A few years now, the game feels incredibly unpolished. I'm not sure why it needs to launch a small..browser? Window for basically handling management of traps and buying stuff, then need to launch a full screen game whenever you actually enter a match and visa versa. Kind of weirdly jaring being pulled to fullscreen and back out again every time you finish  or start a stage."
,Recommended,427270,30212459,Posted: 26 February,all,matt30060,"When OMDU was announced, I was intrigued since I was a big fan of OMD 1 and 2. I spent many hours on those games. So, an online version was interesting.  However, I found the early version of OMDU not very appealing. The graphics weren't good, peformance was poor, and I hated Siege mode. I tried it and didn't get it, so I left. It wasn't my job to force myself to like it when I have so many other games accessible to me I naturally loved.   OMDU was initially so far off from what I enjoyed so much from OMD 1&2.When I saw the acknowledgement in Version 1.6 that Siege mode was a failure and that renewed focus would go back to Survival mode, I was willing to come back and try it. Robot Entertainment acknowledged that they noticed that once people tried Siege mode, people never came back.  Siege mode was running their fans off and they needed to put a stop to that. As far as I was concerned, that spoke to me and they finally ""got it"". They understood why people loved OMD. It was going up against hordes of monsters and beasts and having a lot of fun killing them in a cartoonish manner.I always enjoyed how ""deaths"" were portrayed as funny, cartoonish slices of meat and other Rated G portrayals. No zombie gore type of stuff.  I loved the humorous quips and remarks that came out of all the various characters both the good guys and the bad guys.OMDU 1.6 was better but still very rough in terms of graphics and playability. There were quite a few performance related bugs which hurt the appeal. But with OMDU 1.7, as far as I am concerned, got it really right. That is the turning point.  And with the OMDU 1.8, it is just fabulous.I log in every day.  Robot Entertainment is successfully convincing me to log in every day if for no other reason than to get the rewards even if I don't have time or energy to play. Very smart to reward people coming back every day. I think it can get better with OMD 1.9 but I am enjoying OMD 1.8 a lot!  And the adding of Steam Achievements is just fabulous.I was initially very skeptical of OMDU up to version 1.6 but Robot turned a significant corner beginning version 1.7.If there were any skeptics before or people who were turned off because it was far from a follow-up of OMD2, I think they need to come back and take a good relook. And those people who might have had negative reviews might end up changing them to positive reviews.Let's do our part and make sure that old negative reviews are updated fairly. Robot should be rewarded with some positive words because they are on the right path. They got beaten up early on and it was justified. But I believe they need to be complimented for being honest, open, and making a huge turn. Reward them with an HONEST positive review if you think they got it right. I am unhappy the Steam review says Mixed because it is unfair. Robot Entertainment deserves better.  Because the happier and larger the fanbase, the more all of us benefit individually.OMDU 1.8 is very different now and much improved to OMDU 1.6 and earlier. Believe me!P.S. The number of hours I've played/logged on OMDU on Steam does not count all the unrecorded hours of OMDU outside of Steam."

This, on the other hand... does not really need you to do that. When I played with my friend, all we did was spam spam spam and kill as much orcs we can with our hero abilities... we did not rely much on the traps and unlike OMD2, the orcs do not react to the physics of your attacks.. much? I recall the primary attacks do not make the orcs pause or react at all. Remember the times where you could charge a huge blow and send the orcs flying, that's fun.UX wise, i personally feel this is a downgrade from OMD2. Being a game dev myself I understand there needs to be some adjustments when there are some additional game mechanics added but making less of what was before is boterhing me as a gamer.Overall, this game reminds me of Heroes of the Storm... but if I were to play games like that, I'd rather play HOTS."

76561198017534950,Not Recommended,427270,34966818,Posted: 15 September,all,Heretic,The game implements some great new ideas and looks good while playing it. However it isn't the same as the first two were in the level of engagement and interest. It crashed out a few times and the windowed loading screens just seemed odd considering the first two titles were smooth playing and great looking games. At this time I cannot recommend it. Its by no means a bad title just not what I expected after playing OMD and OMD2.
,Not Recommended,427270,29415321,Posted: 21 January,all,Spogie,"This was a great concept, even better with the PvP siege mode. Now that I've had time to play with just the PvE mode becuase they didn't feel that was their path, I am even more disappointed. The didnt seem to balance the characters after the PvP mode, I find some of the skills useless (like Ivys ability to heal what would have been your minions, you are now apart from your allies mostly, Tundr's wall, and many others). I liked the ability to craft which traps I wanted, now Im stuck with a random pick on crap traps I dont want to us.Bring back the PvP!"

The beta testers played arround 300 matches of 17 minutes (~90h) without the premium boost (~70h with) only to unlock them. We got no compensation (and no reward for the beta). We played this for nothing.~300€ : I calculated it for you. It's nearly what you need, if you want to pay to get a good trap set t7 (highest lvl). But you can get it by playing (I played 300h and I don't have all my principal traps t7)...~140€ : it's what you need to get the actualy disponible skins/dyes (a lot are not, now). The ways to get skins without money are close to 0. A skin price is up to 5€, and there is actualy 16 characters.Edit 21/05/2017 : even if you pay 500€, you wont get all traps T7.And now the non-optional, because without this, you will waste your time and feel bad :4.50€/w : this is what youmustspend by week to drop a more decent amount of skulls (money). But after 90 lvl played, I can say it is honestly a scam, because it's clearly written ""skulls x2"", and it's false : you get only the skulls x2 from drop, and not from lvl-up or chests. A recurent drop you will get at a end of a match, for exemple is : 850 skulls (200 from chest, 500 from lvl-up, and 150 for the match) x2 = 1000 skulls. Because the x2 is only on the drop.The price of this has been multiplicated by 5 just at the end of the beta.Some other remarks (I don't speak about temporary bugs here) :You can drop useless stuffs on chests (a very large ammount). Bad upgrades (usual on games), or upgrades when you still have the traps at the maximum lvl (it's worse).I remember you can get banned (even if you paid stuffs on beta) if you play with 2 random guys that trolls you, and that irritate you enough for you to insult them, and them report you. It's idiot because there is an automatic censorship of words in game, ofc... Do what Gameforge recommand, never insult IG, be hypocritical on this case and get scammed... But it's important to say, now it maybe changed, because Robot intertainment took back the developpement (and the support/moderation ?). I don't know if it's better, same or worse. I will edit this if needed.With the new mode, now the game is a lot funnier, even if it's still not as good as OMD2.Edit 21/05/2017 : at lvl >90 and with sabotage mode, maybe it is, but random mates will ""sabotage"" your rank.I let you my precedent review, I was under lvl 20, but it's 80% true :Who is the genius that removed all the fun from OMD2 ?With a friend we finished OMD2 with all skulls, all difficulties, it was a very good game.This is what we think about OMDU, now :caracters are weak.traps are weak.weapons are weak.all enemies are HP bags.you must pay for everything, upgrades, caracters. Paytowin on beta, GG.graphisms are bad, all is smaller. lol even the font used for damages look bored now.maps are bad. Everyone plays to the same one, just to get xp and money, what a fun.trap number is limited, what a stupid idea.stupid cooldowns on weapons (mana is already a limit morons).no headshot, byebye the arbalest interest.no carnage. It was ""BOOOOM BOOOOOOOMM!!!!"", now it's ""pwef..zz pwew...""byebye the interesting guardians, now it's the MOBA style obligatory guardian.GUI and menus suck, but here it's really a detail.no fun.You kept the apparence of an OMD, but it's not what was fun on OMD. What was so good in OMD2 ? All what you removed.-------------------------------------------------------------------Now, why a negative review ? Maybe those reasons are good enough but there is something worse. If you see my reviews, you realise that I'm the only one who speak about the fact a lot of games are polluated by a propaganda from the sect who seem to love deamons, lucifer, sorcelery... They are here to make you love deamons and hate Justice. It's not only on the games for sure, it's TV, mangas/films... And the sect wich add this poison,tortures childs IRL. Some knows about what I speak. Here it's not a coincidence, because there is pentagrams, ""rifts"", ""masters of rifts"", deamons shown as being cool and powerful... The deloppers don't need to be satanist, those directives are infused from their bosses or/and funders."
,Recommended,427270,29713126,Posted: 5 February,all,Zeemond,"Since their latest big change, Orcs must die Unchained has stepped up to what their fans wanted. They removed the pvp (for now, perhaps something to consider later), and have brought the focus back to good old maps, survival, and teamwork. There is a twist this time around, there is an overall progression and a random aspect in how you acquire traps and resources. Just with daily log in you can earn premium currency, skulls and chest containing goodies. Every levels now has 3 leaderboards: solo, 2 players and 3 players. Due to trap and equipment acquisition being random to a level, it leads to not all players having the same trap options at the same level, which may be helpful for high difficulty planing/endless maps.The game is well worth a try for anyone who think they might enjoy it, it has some decent humor and fun factor. There is just enough variety and challenge to keep many of us going for a while.There is, luckily, not really a P2W aspect to the game, as the only money exclusive items are cosmetic.Give it a try and I hope ya'll enjoy it!-Lost"

That just isnt the case! Heres the scoop for me. OMD has always had a certain amount of ""replay burn out"" to it. Once you would hit so many skulls in the previous games, you maxed out the upgrades to traps, though OMD 2 was alot more replayable.This game offers a massive amount of depth to it, with all the new upgrades. I am also very fond of all the new heros you can play, and while some of the changes(gaurdians are the big one for me) are a bit odd, the game flows together quite nicely.I am still in my early stages of playing it, but so far I see alot of potential given this is only the beta, & with their free to play model? Its a solid nice fun game, & the grind isnt boring. I like to play this on breaks when I am working, or as a short little thing to do before bed.I expect to be playing this for many hours in the future."

Why is the game divided into two different screens, one with the actual game and one which feels like a cheap mobile game? Why did you put RPG elements in, which increase your level but only for that map? While the other XP-System has no meaning? Worse yet, the pop-up when you can decide on meaningless power-ups pops up at the worst of times, when you are in close combat and can't see shot? Why the fock did you put in In-App purchases?In my opinion, it would have been so easy: More maps, more placing freedom, more trap customization! Done!BTW: I paid for a copy while it was still Alpha, and now it is for free? You suck!Please just publish some more DLCs for OMD2, that would be great!"

It's free!A lot of the negative reviews here are, I think, from the first iteration of the game. Since December 2016 there has been a huge update and (for me) this is a significant step in the right direction. They have completely removed the PvP (which never felt right and put me off the game early on) and are now focussing on the 'classic' Orcs Must Die experience - battlegrounds. The PvP set back this game's development but we now basically have an Orcs Must Die 3 with the following changes:i) Free to Play model, which to Robot's credit is not intrusive, although it does lead to some grind.ii) Up to 3 players in a team, a natural progression on the 2 player co-op from OMD2.iii) Tonnes more characters, each of which plays in a unique and interesting way.iv) Many more levels of difficulty, allowing a significantly more hardcore experience in War Mage, Master and Rift Lord difficulties.v) Hangover 'balancing' compromises from PvP such as no headshots, slower-than-necessary heroes and server-side infrastructure (meaning no pausing during games and a 'trap cap' of maximum traps per team).I don't leave many reviews but I've been really enjoying this game so far, and I know how important steam reviews are to developers (and prospective players). There are still issues with the game, but based on the recent changes I feel optimistic. If you gave this a pass before, now might be a good time to dive back in and give Orcs Must Die Unchained a go."

,Not Recommended,427270,29612212,Posted: 31 January,all,Aro~So,"It's as if Robot took all the good things about the previous two installments (quick and fluid movement in both map navagation and control input, streamlined UI, fast load times, charming art direction, carefuly crafted map design, and a SINGLE PLAYER/CO-OP EXPERIENCE) and just chucked it all as a desperate ploy to get in on that sweet sweet MOBA money. The franchise was already a blend between shooter and tower defence, this experement pushed things one step too far by flirting with MOBA style vs mode which has permiated into the single player side of the game. Sadly it offers nothing in the way of what fans of the series want, which is often as simple as more of 1 & 2, but with greater map variety and a longer list of scenarios and levels, or at least a map editor and maybe mod support.Granted this is beta, so much of it's core design feels like a step backwards.Edit: I'll clarify, while the game is *now* single and co-op, the core mechanics have been designed on a MOBA foundation:https://youtu.be/hXzAahLlCYY?t=7m49sThose core mechanics have bled through production to the extent that everything looks and feels 'cheapened' for the sake of pvp. Perhaps this has more to do with the engine than the early MOBA direction, I can't say, though other aspects reflect that carry over. Systems for loot, leveling, currency and even difficulty levels are all based around a protracted grind and the fact that you can just outright buy gold and skulls as a microtransaction indicates that while Robot may have backpeddaled away from Unchained The MOBA, they certainly didn't fully re-commit to a proper single or co-op focused experience.To that end, Robot can now justifiably reap the rewards of a moba while not having to worry so much about hero and item balance. This in turn allows them the ability to lock away disproportionately powerful heros and items behind paywalls and turn a blind eye towards power creep.What worries me most about all this is that if Robot is commited to turning the franchise into a long term microtransaction engine then we can forget about a proper follow up to the fantastic first two games."

Very satisfactory to kill loads of them and get combo's.I also like that you can play with 3 players coop.While playing alone it's easy to complete a map, but it is hard to do so while staying within the time limit and getting 5 stars. Also pretty hard to play coop since the orcs become stronger then.Lastly i want to add that at the time of writing this the game has enoug players to enjoy playing online."

76561198024646136,Recommended,427270,29616266,Posted: 31 January,all,Rabob,"Hello thereSo I've been seeing a lot of negative reviews here complaining about:1. That it's not PvP anymore.2. That it's pay-to-win.3. That the RNG of chests ruins the experience.What is Orcs Must Die Unchained currentlyOMDU is a PvE Tower defense mixed with a third person shooter (with abilities). Most of the maps you can play solo, but especially in higher difficulties or when you simply don't have a high level or good traps you might want to team up.Currently it looks to become a successor of OMD1 and OMD2 instead of a spin-off MOBA.What no PvP?Yes, that's right. It used to be MOBA in which you went 5v5, but the playerbase is simply to small to make that an enjoyable game mode. So you end up with teams being unbalanced because high skilled premade teams were matched versus newcomers. The newcomers in turn would end up dying a lot and they would have a negative experience, making them not return to the game. Leading again to the problem of a too small playerbase. So as off December 2016 they removed this mode and focused on PvE with a max of 3 players (most maps can be done solo if you prefer).But it's still pay-to-win right?No, because first of all you can team up with other players which might have traps that you don't. Second the most important trap, the barricade, you get after the tutorial. The second most important imo is brimstone. Which you normally get fairly soon as well.How do I get traps then and is the RNG really that bad?You get them via 3 ways. The first one is when you complete the tutorial. Which gives you a couple of basic traps.Second and most importantly, you get them from chests, you get 1 chest per day for a quest (like kill 1500 minions), 2 chests for completing a map on 5 stars, 1 chest for each hero with whom you complete a map (regardless of stars), 1 chest as weekly login and another 5 chests in total from the weekly challenge. So if you complete every map with every hero, you can still get 13 chests per week (5 weekly challenge, 1 weekly login, 7 daily quests).The quests can normally be completed within an hour of gameplay. There is also the option to buy chests from the store, but I haven't done that myself.The third way of getting traps, is via the daily deals. Every day there are 3 random cards in the store which you can buy with skulls (the currency you earn with completing maps). This has only been active for half a month or so and I have already gotten 2 new epic traps with it and bought several rare ones as well. On Sunday there are even 6 random traps to choose from. Which means that during the year there are ~1250 card deals (3 per day, 6 on sunday). So if you earn enough skulls, you never have to buy a chest. Unless you are really unlucky.When it comes to traits and parts however, you won't be able to get these during a daily deal. So if you really want to get the most out of your traps you probably need to buy chests if you want to get the most DPS. So far it hasn't been necessary and I have 5 stars on almost all maps. (some I only played once so far and didn't bother to 5 star yet)How easy is it to get skulls (earnable currency)?It's alright. Not too fast, but also not too slow to a sense you will never progress. If you play for 1 hour on average I guess you could earn 1000 per day from:1. Beating the daily quest (500 skulls)2. The daily login (skulls vary, seventh day is a chest)3. Leveling up (I think about 250 skulls per level, and there is a daily quest for exp to make it easier as well)4. Finishing a map, it depends on the difficulty. Like an easy map which lasts 7 minutes or so probably gives 50-100 skulls or so.So in short you can buy the daily deals and champs after some time without paying.ConclusionIn it's current state I would recommend OMDU. It takes some time to complete the tutorial, but overall I like the direction it is going since it went full PvE. And if you don't believe me, just try it out. It's free-to-play anyway. And it's not like you have a life or something otherwise you would not be reading this :YTeam:"

Few maps are easy, few are way too hard. Sometimes it feels like traps and heroes is not enough. Only few problems:- No Steam Workshop support for more maps (or even not via SW).- No player characters progress overall - only in match we have battle levels - that's all (no upgrades, increasing stats, etc.).- No servel list - this is a big problem. To find any random match sometimes you have to waste 10+ mins or just simply game find a match - solo match...- More players means less firepower. For ex. Hero basic damage is 100 when playing solo, then 50 when playing with one mate, 33 when playing with 2 mates, etc. This is also unfair and it makes a lot of trouble, 'cause even weakest units will not die fast enough.- Dumb players... Sorry to say, but it's true. Most players I've already meet have no idea how to play their heroes (for ex. how to deal crits via trickshots) and where place traps (or how they work) for effect."

Because it's broken, It's just frustrating trying to get it to work, so if you want to play this, might as well download it from the web browser. It saves you some damn time.The game itself offers quite a nice new take on the game, all though it's a mixed bag for some. You'll earn new traps as you level up, unlocking more and more on each milestone level that earns you a new title and a new difficulty level, as these traps are made avalible you have to recive them from chests in order to actually get them. Or buy them for skulls (The free currency in the game that you get from playing matches) and it's not that hard leveling up traps, at least not at the start. I guess later on it could get quite tedious, but i haven't experienced that.The game offers a wider variety of heroes than the previous games have, including some old foes returning as allies (Though as you might've guessed, you gotta unlock them, either with premium or free currency)"

,Recommended,427270,29451251,Posted: 23 January,all,KaXaSA,"It's a really fun game, I don't really care that much about the multiplayer, it's fun with friends but imo it's a lil' frustrating to play with random players, everyone has their own strategies / their own traps + there is a trap limit in each map. I don't really play this kind of game for the multiplayer experience. Having said that sabotage is fun they had a really good idea with this game mode.Playing solo I got 5 stars in all maps so it's doable to play this like a single player game, but there is some grind -mostly the early maps- or if you are really unluck with the loot/ get too many upgrades for traps you don't really use/ care.The F2P system is 'fair' but it's pretty much all RNG they give you 2 chests on each map for winning with 3 and 5 stars + 1 chest for completing each map with each character -the number of stars doesn't matter, as long as you finish the map with one star you get the chest- AFAIK The loot is random.They updated the game and now every 24h(?) you can buy 3 traps on the store > deals (using in-game currency). These ""deals"" are actually pretty expensive IMO the in-game currency is better spent buying characters & upgrading traps, It's more like an 'end game deal' to use when you upgraded your most used traps and bought most/all the characters -remember that you get an extra chest for each map you complete with each character-This F2P model is actually good compared to other games and it's way better than what we had in the old system, in less time I have more traps, upgrades, traits, etc. than I ever had before.Minor Issues:The 'par timer' does NOT pause between waves - this is by far the most stupid/ frustating thing in this game, every few waves there is a 'phase break' the minion waves stop to give the players some time to move around build more traps, decide what to do next, etc. The issue is that the 5th star is time based, each map has a par time and guess what? the par timer is still running in the background (press tab to see it) even during the phase breaks, so if all the 3 players don't resume the game (Z) fast there is a huge chance that they won't finish the game in time to get that annoying 5th star.Lag/Latency issues - if you don't live in the same location as the servers (NA/EU) you will experience some lag, it's noticiable especially when you are playing ranged characters / trying to hit the fast moving minions, 'hunters' will often disappear/ teleport / hit you when they are not near you. Also why do I need to connect to a server in NA making my latency 200~300ms+ when I'm playing solo? ლ( ʘ◞౪◟ʘ‵ლ Latency issues makes the game a lot less enjoyable.Overall it's an amazing game, I know it's not the same but if you like tower defense games you should probably check the Orcs Must Die Franchise."
