,Not Recommended,427470,22383694,"Posted: 12 April, 2016",all,SirLagsalott,"There's plenty of things to say about this game. Most of the reviews that have come out today, or will come out in the future, mostly say the same thing: ""This game should have been a DLC."" I agree, but since that will be the narrative of the other reviews I'd like to talk about everything else.First: the content from the original.Most of the original policies are duplicated here, with only minor changes. But the qualms I had with the old policies are the same - for example, why do technology grants reduce religious membership? No one's going to look at a computer and say ""there's electricity, therefore God does not exist"". Same thing with space exploration and other policies. I haven't heard a valid explanation for that.Additionally, few things have been changed. Everything that isn't involved with the changed voting groups has been left untouched, and some changed systems don't justify the price tag.Now, the new content.The in-game descriptions do not say why Conservatives are opposed to female mutilation bans. It's one thing to say that they oppose sex education, but to say that they support the mutilation of genitals is bizarre and a strange message to send to game players. The description of that policy is only about a sentence long, and the other descriptions give similarly vague (or nonexistant) explanations to why certain groups dislike them.I also wish there would be something to make the game *feel* different. The background is tinted sepia, there's some new music but everything else is the same. The animations are the same, the mechanics are the same, and there's still the menu bug where placing your cursor between two menu buttons would highlight both items which makes clicking do odd things. There's no Steam Workshop (as of 4/12/16, first day of release), so once you've played all the nations you've just about seen everything there is to see.In closing, there's really nothing to recommend here. It shares all the same good points and bad points as the original, but bundled into an extra $15 package that just doesn't feel worth it. In response to fears that the game is just overpriced DLC, the creator went on forums and told people that the game had enough content to stand on its own. I'm afraid not."
76561198062930115,Recommended,427470,22390042,"Posted: 13 April, 2016",all,DG Dobrev,"TL; DR version of the review:If you don't own Democracy 3, buy Democracy 3 Africa. If you own Democracy 3, buy D3A now or on a sale if you feel confident with D3 and want more challenge. If you own D3 and dislike the idea of a country swap with some added policies and difficulty, or think that can be achieved by mods, stay away from D3A, or buy it on sale.Democracy 3 Africa makes the vanilla Democracy 3 look like a tutorial to this one. In D3, you were put in charge of countries that are economically stable, have way less problems and are generally easy to manage. In D3A, you are thrown into a land of inequality, tension, turmoil, uncompetitive economy, and numerous problems ranging from aids to crime. As such, it is substantially harder than the vanilla D3 and requires way more planning and strategic thinking, instead of simple clicking, to which you eventually gotten used to in D3 because some policies worked better than the others.In true fashion of my reviews, I will take a look at the good and the bad.The GOOD:1. More challenges for you to overcome - from trying to fix the public health and economy to watching your back every step of the way, the gameplay is fun and engaging.2. Every country in the roster plays differently - they all have their problems and you need to solve them carefully, while trying to survive and get re-elected.3. A number of new policies for you to implement, tinker with, and use to your advantage.4. Strategic thinking wins the game more than ever - diving in a new game is a challenge in itself. It is extremely important to analyze the situation that you have been given and react accordingly.5. Strategic planning is crucial - after you have analyzed the situation, you really need to plan a number of turns ahead and be aware of the consequences of your actions.6. Multiple ways to victory - from trying the benevolent way to banning weapons and arming your army and police forces with submachine guns to keep the peasants in line, every country in the roster provides a number of ways to survive long enough for you to retire victoriously.7. More assassinations coming your way - yeah, that's a good thing in my opinion. It forces you pay to more attention to the lower part of the ""gun"" table, which is something I felt few people do in D3. When the first warning comes, you always have a chance to react because of your stability. No more - here you may have a really ineffective law enforcement situation, that you may kick the bucket on the next turn.8. You get to pick your difficulty - just like in D3, the game does not constrict you in any way. Play the way you want - even a few % difference on a slider can make for a completely unique experience.9. Last but not least, and very important - unlike vanilla D3, I never felt like doing the very same thing to achieve success. Playthroughs are way more diverse and way more fun.And now, a look at the BAD:1. Huge difficulty spike in comparison to Democracy 3, to the point where it may be off-putting to some. You will feel like doing the correct thing, just to get assassinated on the next turn.2. Assassinations happen way too often - which can also be a bad thing. Unlike D3, you have no time to react, unless you were aware of the situation and did so in advance - as assassinations oftentimes happen on the next turn after the warning.3. Realism - I have often asked myself just how realistic this game is, and during the past 3 hours of gameplay, I am more incluned to say that it is more unrealistic than not. Some playthroughs felt right, other not at all - for example, with Kenya (which I consider the toughest of them all) I fixed the uncompetitive economy, stopped the crime, achieved gender equality, stabilized the economy, all that while dodging tons of assassinations, just to lose at the elctions. Is that realistic, or ""That's XCOM, baby!!!""?! I will let you decide for yourselves.4. More of a reskin or DLC than a new release  - D3A adds few innovations and policies, along with some new music and pictures, and brands itself a completely new release, when it feels more like a D3 reskin with other countries and increased difficulty.5. Price tag - it is the valid concern of the community. Being a reskin with added difficulty and new countries, I myself can't help but wonder if that whole thing could have just been modded into the vanilla D3 through the workshop, and I am more inclined to say that, yes, it could...CONCLUSION:I recommend this game based on the fact that it constantly challenges me and helps me develop a better awareness of the situation that I am put in. If D3 felt like a very elaborate puzzle, then D3A elevated it to new heights and added additional challenge. As such, I feel right at home. I liked the original D3, and I like this one as well. I expect to dump easily over 15 hours in it, and I am looking forward to it.However, what's a good game for me may not be a good game for you. The downsides of D3A are the lack of substantial innovation and prety much not enough new content to merit it's asking price. This is why, if you are unsure whether to buy or not, I would suggest to grab the vanilla D3 on sale (if you don't own it already), tinker around with it for a bit, get a feel what you can expect from the game, and then buy D3A when it goes 33% or more off."

I greatly lowered poverty through food programs. Improved foreign relations and boosted trade, foreign investment and tourism through international partnerships. Implemented costly education reform, boosted privet schooling, re-educated adults and started a university programme. Yes I implement harsh crime and punishment laws and initiatives but my people gave me no choice. Race riots, violent crime and religious persecutions were rampant and harming development.I maintained a positive cash flow through improved foreign aid, marginally higher income tax and a small carbon tax, yet despite this low and middle income earnings actually improved noticeably. I also implemented a large number of small social and environmental programs. Stability and democracy in my country had greatly improved and I was making progress in education and productivity. Yes there was still plenty of problems to solve but I had already done so much.Despite all this, I lost my first election in a landslide.

76561197995051730,Not Recommended,427470,22459762,"Posted: 16 April, 2016",all,Sodar,"I have recently revised Africa 3, to update my initial review.When it first came out, I blasted the game for :-	Being a blatant money grab, as the D3:A is basically DLC at the cost of a standalone game, when even at its best could barely count as an expansion pack.-	Ridiculously imbalanced assassinations.-	Lack of proper integration with other DLC and mods – everything is done through the Democracy 3 menu, which remains priced at 23 Euros. Disgusting.-	Lack of proper lategame.As of now, the game remains an overpriced insult to gamers all around. The mechanics of Urbanization, Corruption/Democracy Decay, Women’s Rights and Foreign Aid aren’t nearly enough to justify a 15 Euro price, especially since I can’t use any of that in the main Democracy 3 game. At least all the other DLCs have the decency to work on both D3 and D3:A. There is still no proper integration for mods and DLCs, and Democracy 3 is as expensive as it was.Assassinations seem to be have been toned down a bit. I was having less of them, and they were more realistic – getting killed by patriots after passing several policies unpopular among them seems only fair. Repression also seems to be doing its job now – especially since lack of stability makes it impossible for liberals to surface, so backwater African dictatorships won’t suffer from feminist and gay ninjas anymore. Neat-o.There is still no actual late game. Once you win your first election, there is nothing that can properly challenge you anymore. You are beloved left and right, and the few negative situations that arise are nothing compared to what you battled earlier. “Oh nooo, our people are obese, how can we fight that, we who just eliminated Malaria, HiV, female genitalia mutilation, race wars and military Coups in our country!” Then again, this is LITERALLY first world problems – good job me, now my biggest problem is fat people. Thank god they don’t count as a voting group, probably since it wouldn’t be believable for them to carry out assassinations.Which brings me to my main issue – there’s not enough replayability. I spent at most a couple of hours on D3:A after coming from Democracy 3, and I feel like I have seen everything the game has to offer. I could, I guess, try to run my country without ever turning into a democracy, but that’s just me amusing myself, not the developer providing proper gameplay. For 15 Euro I really expect something more.Final verdict – well, it’s still Democracy 3, with all it’s wonderful nation shaping, but the way they’re trying to disguise this overpriced DLC is absolutely reprehensible, and should not be encouraged. Buy at a sale, if at all."

,Recommended,427470,22394295,"Posted: 13 April, 2016",all,ThrownIntoSol,"Democracy 3 AfricaShort Answer - I highly recommend this game!My 'Long Answer' is much more nuanced than a simple yes. I would still recommend this game to someone who wanted a better answer than a, ""Yes!"" but I would definitely preface my answer with an inquiry of what kind of game you'd be comfortable with playing. Although that perhaps sounds slightly sinister the truth is that Democracy 3: Africa is a very niche kind of game.A Short DescriptionDemocracy 3: Africa is a stand-alone ""expansion"" to the political simulation game, Democracy 3.It therefore does not need the original to run, but can run the original's mods and expansions (as long as the original is installed on your computer).Like the original, this game is about managing a country through the careful usage of policies. You'll receive a finite amount of 'Political Capital' each turn that must be spent on; introducing new policies, cancelling old policies, and altering the severity of other policies.The screenshots on the Store Page show the game as it is - there are no other graphics or models than is shown.Things I've noticed that deviate from the originalYou are much more likely to be assassinated, especially by Feminists. This is because as a whole, Women start out in a much more deplorable state than the original, which causes much faster radicalization than the original Democracy 3, this is exacerbated by Intelligence Services that start with very little funding.You will start out with very low (often 0%) Approval Ratings due to the fact that you'll start with numerous red 'Disaster' Events (eg, Armed Robbery, HIV/AIDS, Technology Backwater, etc). This will persist for most of your first Executive Term until -if you're good enough- you'll have ended most of them and your Approval Ratings will jump to above 80%, These jumps in Approval Ratings are much more abrupt than the original.There are now ways to change how long your Executive Term Limit is, as well as the length of each Executive Term. This means that if you want to you can become a Dictator thanks to the ability to also alter the level of Democracy in your country - although this requires a lot of Political Capital!What I LikeIt's a compelling game. You can try different approaches to each game you play. You can very easily 'roleplay' as a different ideology.Easy to grasp, with the option of resetting the Tutorial - which is always nice.An options menu that us functional. Although it appears limited, all the options you'll need are here, from separate Sound-Sliders to alternate Resolutions (and a Full-screen toggle!).A lot more policies than the original!You can set the names of your political party and its opposition, as well as set term limits prior to each game (including options such as 'Monarchy', etc).It's obvious that the Devs of Democracy: 3 Africa have put a lot of though into this game in order to differentiate it from the original and making it feel a lot more 'special' as well as more accurately depicting a lot of the idiosyncrasies of African politics, economy, and social life. I suggest checking out thisCommunity Guidefor more details.Interface is a lot more colourful than the original.On the Steam Forums, most of the ""Haha, Africa doesn't have Democracy!"" morons have been moved by the Dev into a special sub-category - which I find hilarious.What I DislikeIt can be hard to find a specific policy on the main screen. Unless you familiarize yourself with the position, or visual appearance of a policy it can easily be 'lost'.If you check a policy you can see its effects, which are green for increases, and red for decreases. I'm probably an idiot but I do sometimes get confused when I check a red ""Disaster"" Event and check its influences (For example, 'Obesity' has a green bar called 'Food Price' that is increasing it, but my brain says that green is good even though if something increases 'Obesity' levels is not good).The Assassination ending is still a personal issue. Although I understand why it exists (a failure state) I still think it is a slightly ham-fisted means to decentivize rapid angering of a voter group. Although, it should be noted that I cannot think of an effective alternative to it.Each game starts you with a randomized Cabinet - many of whom have Sympathies to groups that you are bound to anger, which will decrease the amount of Political Capital you get. I almost wish you could pre-select a Cabinet to prevent this, but, such a change would circumvent a design choice that encourages players to not anger every group in the first few turns.NotesIt's relatively cheap. Saying ""It should be DLC!"" is kind of redundant considering its priced like a DLC (In my opinion) and is much cheaper than the original Democracy 3.Don't expect an infallible political simulation that is 100% accurate - perfection is an impossible standard.The ideologies and voter groups (Liberal, Conservative, etc) in this game are the ""pure"" forms only really found in textbooks, the political reality is different to the game's reality. Which is a very necessary design choice - so alter your expectations accordingly.My Political-Science Lecturer (from a few semesters ago) is a big fan of the original Democracy 3, and much like me, is overjoyed at having a Democracy 3 game that includes our country South Africa. It means a lot to have a well thought out game set in Africa.EditsA few typos and weird spaces fixed.Added more notes.Added 'Things I've noticed that deviate from the original"" category.Added a few words.This was reviewed on Version 1.0 (Release Version)"

But, while some of the annoying, unrealistic and game-ruining things that were introduced to the ""basic"" game, are present here with the exact same game mechanics, they don't happen as often because of your different starting position.Still, the game suffers from some of the same irritating deviations from reality as Democracy 3 (which is not surprising since it is virtually the same game with minor changes, minor here meaning you really would need some seconds to be sure which of the two games you were playing if you started one of them on accident). For example, you start a game as just having been elected, although for some reason with a popularity of zero, which makes you wonder if you ran on a platform of ""I hate each and every one of you, especially this baby which I'm holding"".However, this, among others, is a more forgivable ""offense"" by the game, since in an African country that might be a bit more realistic than in Europe or the US.So, again, I am recommending this game, but only because it introduces features that should have been in Democracy 3 and because Democracy 3 was updated to be almost unplayable. But, honestly, do not buy it unless it is on sale, unless you liked Democracy 3 before the updates, and unless the sale price is far below the normal price - I payed about 4 Euro and that's probably just below what the normal price for this game should have been in the first place.EDIT: After some more playtime I now find it rather hilarious that I always get assassinated by ethnic minorities a short time after I solved the racism issues in my country, because apparently they are only happy as long as they are being discriminated against."

It takes a while to get used to, and the Matriarchs of Justice is still a big problem in the early game - and I'm not entirely convinced that militant feminism is a realistic threat in an overtly patriarchial and conservative society.Also, not all African nations are included in this pack which can be a turn off for some, which is understandable since realism was a big selling point for this game. The scenarios in each African nation is also not ""tailored"" as the game progresses, which really turns off more people. However, it is still a really meaningful game which puts you into the shoes of a leader of a underdeveloped state and how tempting it must be for him to devolve into an authoritarian state.

Definite buy if you enjoyed Democracy 3 and I recommend for anyone who wants to know more about African countries and politics in general.

There is a meter that tracks the level of Democracy in the nation which is interesting and they have updated the various groups of voters.

Fixing the economy, health and education gets you killed every time, even on the easiest settings. The most important political issue is..... ""It's the economy stupid !!! ""  not fringe issues. Previous Democracy games actually made real world sense. This game has the same engine as the original games but the balance is way off. Also having the choice of African countries, should have been a DLC to Democracy 3. Basically this is a DLC + the light weight, out-dated game engine, without the main content. I had the original Democracy game, on disk and enjoyed it. However Democracy 3 is NOT worth anything near the asking price. This is why I tried Africa. It is an out-dated game with updated screen settings. It is way too simplistic for such a price, in 2016 / 17 ... It should be on the under $10 rack, and Africa should be a $2.00 DLC, if not included. The publisher's of Democracy are like a 65 year old call-girl in a short skirt, thinking she is still 21... This is not the latest addition to the Total War series, with 1000's of hours of development costs."

I'm running Win7 64bit if that makes any difference to folks.UPDATE: It seems that many of the issues folks are having are due to two problems. One is that D3:A doesn't play well with the Avast antivirus program. The other is that if you have mods installed via Democracy 3, you must uninstall those mods in D3, NOT JUST unsubscribe them. The executable for D3:A is apparently getting confused by the D3 mods and causing a crash each time you try to start a new game.The game is like the original D3, but with some significant changes for the change of venue. I suggest that folks who want to find out more about the changes go to the Game Guides section of Democracy 3: Africa and you'll see posted a guide that lays out in detail what is different.I've now played several games of D3:A and it's definitely harder than D3. You will get assassinated pretty quickly unless you can keep folks happy. You may, of course, always disable the chance of assassination in the options menu.Overall D3:A, like D3, is a game of balancing demands from different factions while also trying to keep the economy in check and not be assassinated.

IN AFRICA!Democracy 3: Africa is a political simulator spin-off developed by Positech Games and is part of the Democracy series with Democracy, Democracy 2 and this version Democracy 3The game looks extremely simple when you look at it for the first time. You run the government of Africa and throughout your governmental term in office you have to try and balance the country's GDP, health, education, crime, poverty, unemployment and so on whilst also keeping an eye out for your budget and introducing policiesThroughout your campaign you have to be wary of introducing new laws, sorting out your political party and not get assassinated in the process. Throughout the game you will also have general elections which predict whether or not you will continue another term in parliament, if so, you can continue ruling the country, if not, game overThe game may look simple but it is quite complex and does need a lot of attention to play the game seriously. You need to manage the needs of the people and the needs of the country. The gameplay takes place in a sort of brain web where you select different items such as education or health and sort out the needs of different people, such as; the youth, the elderly, capitalists, liberals, and so onHonestly, I don't know why it is sold seperately as it is mostly the same game, only this time it takes place in Africa and adds a few more situations that are taking place in Africa right now such as warDemocracy 3: Africa is not for everyone, me personally I liked it and yes I have played the previous three Democracy games; Democracy, Democracy 2 and Democracy 3, I can say that the gameplay hasn't changed drastically only that Democracy 3: Africa adds more modern situations (such as privacy infringment and wars) and a neater UIIf you do not like politics or from the get-go don't like how the game looks, then don't bother purchasing Democracy 3: Africa, Democracy 3 or Democracy 2...RECOMMENDED :)"
