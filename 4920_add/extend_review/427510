Specifically, IGN's. Let me tell you, if you haven't seen the reviews, don't look. This game is the greatest example of graphics < gameplay to date. It suffered in reviews just because it looked a few years behind, when the gameplay is solid and fun, character customization is great (not to mention your customized character actually shows up in cutscenes! <3), and there's more than 15 endings! If you love quick slice and dice action adventure games, this is for you. I bought it right when I saw it for $15, but if you're not sure, maybe wait for it to go on sale for a lower price. Personally, I love it, and I would've paid $20 to see one of my favorite series run at a better fidelity then it could on a 7th gen console.Oh and also, the PC port is solid so far. Keep in mind though, that's what it is. A port. not an HD remaster or anything like that. They didn't even give you the almost 10 year old DLC, which is kind of annoying, but whatever.EDIT : Someone asked on my steam profile if the game is locked at 30FPS, and yes, it is unfortunately. Someone might find a workaround at some point, but from what I hear the animations are tied to the frame rate somehow."

You could help the peasants who face brutal taxes at the hands of a new lord, serve the new lord and raise up the ranks for power and wealth, serve the remnants of the old clan who are now resorting to banditry to harass the new clan or serve the attacking army of Oda Nobunaga on his conquest to unite Japan under his rule.The game totes 22 different endings so there is a lot of replay value to the game and in comparison to the console version the games framerate is better, the game looks way sharper, the draw distance isnt 10 feet infront of the character and finally the load times are also far more tolerable and dont take as long as they did on console.If you are a fan of the WotS series or want to play a game in which the theme of playing as a samurai/ronin appeals to you then you should pick it up."
,Recommended,427510,22019946,"Posted: 24 March, 2016",all,ADELBERT BIGPOPPA,"So, I've played a lot more Way of the Samurai 3 than is shown here. I've logged a good forty or fifty hours on the PS3 version of the game; I loved it then, I love it now.Way of the Samurai 3, in my opinion, is greater than 4 in just about every way. The combat feels more varied, the sword crafting is fun and lets you make all sorts of neat weapons, and the endings are more numerous and impactful. Seriously, when I say the endings are numerous, I should just go ahead and elucidate there. There are28 endingsin WotS3, and it's not immediately apparent how to get all of them from the get-go.Way of the Samurai 3 is a game that lets you take it at your own pace. You can go all in on viewing events and progressing the story and reach an ending in about an hour or two, or you can take a bit more time with it, bounce back and forth between paths, and experience all the side content. Both are equally satisfying approaches, and both are equally valid ways to play the game.The game gives you plenty of customizations to make your character look unique, or if you feel so inclined, it is possible to play as any NPC you defeat non-lethally. You also have your choice of weapon and style which let you further mix things up. Most weapons can be broken down into their constituent pieces, which can then be recombined into a new weapon with different stats and given a different style, meaning there are a ton of different weapons you can make. This setup makes progression feel more open-ended and fluid. You can jump from one weapon to the next with relatively little investment and still come out on top, or you can stick with a weapon and make it your own personal ultimate sword. Hell, for the first few playthroughs of the game, before you get your health upgraded and such, you can actually make a pretty killer weapon out of a green onion by raising it to level 10 and giving it the ""Organic"" title. Overall, there's so much depth to a game like this that it's difficult to adequately lay it all out, but let me just condense this all by saying that Way of the Samurai 3 (and to a slightly lesser extent, 4) is an exceptionally deep game that rewards experimentation and encourages multiple playthroughs. It is a game that does not hold your hand, but does not need to. It engenders creativity in service of its mechanics and systems while not discouraging complacency. It is a game that lets you do you.So basically what I'm getting at is you should buy it."
,Recommended,427510,32212465,Posted: 5 June,all,WWarlord,"Way of the Samurai has become one of my favorite series over the past couple of years, and this installment may be my favorite one. Originaly I played this on the xbox 360, and decided I would revisit it on the pc port. Honestly over the forty somthing hours I played before writing this review it only crashed on me a few times, all of which were when I alt tabbed out of the game. That said, I don't alt tab out any more and it runs fine.The Run down...-good ol fashion samurai fun-good mix of sandbox rpg and fighting game mechanics-lots of weapons to collect, parts to find, missions to do and moves to learn-a plethora of unlockables-more endings then a bioware game-stable (for me, apparantly results may vary)-can turn random girls komonos into skirts  (good I guess??)"
,Recommended,427510,22041504,"Posted: 25 March, 2016",all,Mr. Hugh Mannity,"Keep in mind that I have only been playing for about eight hours and besides the other two in the series, I haven't played WOTS4 for a reason. With that said here's my impression:For those who have played the first two Way of the Samurai titles, you know what to expect here with the third installment. For the unintitated, it would be best to know what this game is not. It's not GTA with swords or a hack-and-slash game, it's purely a decision-based system in which you tell the story where to go by triggering inklings or scenes or behaving differently. Killing innocents and looting them or saving people from injustice and defending yourself with blunt attacks clearly imply 2 ways you can play the game but they don't necessarily guarantee you the same ending. No matter how you end the game, however, it begins in the same fashion. You're found on the battlefield within an inch of your life by two looters and, one way or another, you are led to a farming village where a cot is set up for you. From this point on, the fate of the town and its people is in your hands.The game play is a mix of samurai action and arcade fighter. When you're fighting enemies you focus on one at a time, and when you take them out another steps in. with the variety of weapons available you can do sweeping attacks with some them and take out multiple people, even if you're just focusing on one. The map is broken up into a bunch of different areas, and you can visit all of them from the get go. Blue exclamation marks show the inklings (story) events you can see, and even the order as you see some of these changes the game.So do I like the game? Yes I love the game because of it's open ended approach. It gives me a sense of actually being a samurai and doing something that affects a person or a community. There are tons of ""Samurai"" games out there that walks the line between a fighting game and a comic-book rpg and this is not one of them. Do I like the graphics? Well... to be honest I'm not easily blinded by eye-candy. I still go for the substance of the game. The graphics are basically good PS2 era and while it's locked into 30FPS, it doesn't take away from the playability of the game. Besides, graphics is like the least of my requirements when choosing a game. There's also an option to switch between the English voice cast audio which is somewhat lazy or the much superior Japanese voice cast instead, so choose wisely.Ghostlight definitely did a good job with this port, judging by how smooth the game run and I haven't seen people complaining too. All in all, it's a great game and a solid port. It might not be for the trigger happy sword wielding gamers who want to hack and slash for hours. This game takes patience. The game isn't hard in terms of dealing with NPCs. What makes the game difficult is making the right choice at the right time, and being able to face the consequences of your actions."

The katana completes you, spiritually /s- BAD PC PORT. Like seriously this is the elephant in the room. The control is HORRIBLE as the result (by default, the jump button is escape). I highly recommend you to get a gamepad- Graphic is par with PS2 graphic- Gameplay is fixed at 30 fps. Animations are tied to FPS (common issue with Japanese PC games)- Very little and vague gameplay tutorial. You are pretty much left to discover everything by yourselfThe main point of differentation of WotS series in general is gameplay repetition to unlock everything (swords, endings, etc.) as things, especially storylines, are usually mutually exclusive depending on decision you made. Each gameplay last upto 100 in-game days, but can be cut short for numerous reason (eg. you die).Overall I still can recommend Way of the Samurai 3 despite its numerous issues. The gameplay and story on itself make the game worth through the troublesPost-lot-so-hours gameplay EDIT: The game is wayyyy grindy than you might think"
,Recommended,427510,22014344,"Posted: 23 March, 2016",all,William Shakesman,"Brief, 15 minute-ish play port report, it runs pretty good on my machine. The frame rate is a little janky and not all that smooth but it's perfectly playable.Following is a review from playing it on consoles, WotS3 has a special place in my heart. It was my first Way of the Samurai game and it turned me on to this series. As before, it's a sort of open world, choose your own adventure story as a samurai. WotS3 boasts over 20 endings though, far more than any other game in the series, as well as the ability to freely kill any character at any time and the plot generally routing around that as best as possible. (In other WotS's, most major characters would run away from a fight unless you had worked the plot out to a specific boss battle against them. Since every major character had a unique sword, you were generally trying to hunt them down as a meta-game. Here, you can just get a good sword day one by finding a named person and killing them. WotS4 only gave you a free kill on poor, unloved Melinda.) This makes actually iterating through the story generally interesting as your repeated plays are exploring what happens in Amana at various points in the plot and trying to figure out which collection of triggers are needed for different paths. Side with the bandits? Side with the warlord? Side with one of several side characters? Endings are everywhere, and since the plot takes itself relatively seriously compared to the corny WotS4, they're rewarding to find. (Also, less of a linear path than WotS4.)So, these repeat plays are maybe an hour and half to two hours long. You don't lose anything when you end the game and start again, so you're constantly building up cash, better swords, unlocking new combat moves, collecting new gear, meeting new companions, etc. There's quite a bit to keep you coming back aside from the endings, you can certainly spend hours playing without caring about the story. Some of the grindy stuff is rough around the edges compared to Way of the Samurai 4 and, this is important, THE SIDE QUESTS ARE REALLY BAD. DO NOT DO THE SIDE QUESTS UNLESS YOU ARE PLANNING A RUN AROUND THEM. They are the biggest wastes of time and the only time side quests are handy is if you need to join the warlord's team or you really want to get the unique boss fights and swords for completing all the side quests in a chain. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THEM YOU CAN GET CASH ELSEWHERE.The combat is solid hack and slash, focusing on 1v1 combat. Nothing great but certainly fun. Unique to WotS3 compared to 4 is the ability to instant kill weak enemies by timing a perfect parry to their attacks, and in the 100 man fights, this can lead to massive kill chains.I've enjoyed every Acquire game I've played and with Akiba's Trip and WotS4, there is no shortage of good ones on Steam. But WotS3 got a PC port because there was a huge demand for it. If you enjoyed WotS4, give WotS3 a shot. You'll understand the clamor for it."

,Recommended,427510,22769553,"Posted: 2 May, 2016",all,somebody336,"Way of the Samurai 3 is an odd mix of both Open World and Simulator were you can spend your days exploring, fighting or working for one of two factions. The closest comparison I can give to this game has to be the Dead Rising series as both work on a day system where each one leads to unique events as well as both having a bunch of interconnected areas that serve as the world. We play as a nameless and fully customizable character that awakens wounded and battered in the aftermath of a pretty big battle. Right off the bat we are approached by two villagers and are introduced to this games dialogue system where you can either pick from one of three responses or unsheathe your sword  which can lead to either them running in fear or a fight. This title does not hold your hand at all and from the start you can go whatever direction you want and learning as you go.You can lead a peaceful life and find a partner to settle down with you or you can go up to a faction leader, murder him and get paid for doing nothing but letting your bandit like faction do their thing. Way of the Samurai 3 offers much freedom to the player with noticeable consequences and effects which makes this a highly replayable title. The lack of guidance really harms the experience for the first few hours as you don't know how to fight, you don't know much about what is going on or even what to do. To learn how to fight you must visit the dojo in a location called “Guard Gate”  where you are given basic instructions on how defend yourself. Unfortunately dialogue in this game is a absolute pain since every time you ask a question you are returned to the beginning of the conversation and must make your way back to the questions branch. Kind of a hard thing to describe so I'll use an example. Imagine asking your wife or friend how her day was and she goes on and on with no end in sight. Finally you get to ask a question but if you want to ask another one you will have to listen to how her day was all over again.All that just to learn how to properly fight and learning about some skills such as jump kicking or throwing weapons at enemies that you will likely not find out about by yourself. The lack of handholding is fine but some form of manual for the basic things such as these would have helped greatly. As for the dialogue there isn't much of it, for better or worse. Outside of the tutorial characters that teach you about the game there is usually only small tidbits text to read so that annoying problem mentioned a while ago becomes rare. This is really not the type of game you get for a compelling story or interesting characters. The story is interesting in that neither of the two factions are benevolent but aside from that nothing of interest is to be found. The few unique characters to be found are bland and unmemorable as well. What makes Way of the Samurai 3 interesting is the effect you can have on the world and characters. Whether they bow down at the mere sight of you, run in fear or plot for your death is solely based on you and your actions.This however is no GTA game. You are punished for random murder or harming an innocent NPC by losing out on some “Samurai Points” that are given out at the end of a playthrough for all your noble actions. Samurai Points unlock new clothing, fighting styles and other goodies so it is in your best interest to not play like a psycho which is easier said than done. The combination of the awkward combat and the NPCs gathering in a small circle to watch a fight make it very easy for your enemy to dodge a blow causing you to kill or injure an innocent and receive a point penalty. Each area and faction of the game has their own opinions of you so you can terrorize one village and be a hero in the next if you so choose. Those two villages are the only ones in the game, the rest of areas are stuff like guard posts or faction strongholds. It's not a big world by any means and you will have seen every location in no time, especially if you fast travel. What keeps such a small world interesting is all the minor things that can happen the next day that was not there the day before.Traveling the world is kind of confusing at first as the layout of the lands and where areas lead to feel pretty non-intuitive but with the world being so small you'll know the layout like the back of your hand sooner rather than later. Fast traveling may take up more of the in game's day than simply walking there in real time. The environments hold nothing interesting and with the sever lack of character models you will be seeing the same few people over and over again which doesn't make the prospect of walking to your objective all that attractive. The lack of character modules is one of the major thing that makes this world feel empty especially your first time through when you are wondering which one of these clones are giving out the quests.Completing quests is the only to gain the respect and the favor of the people your doing them for but none of them are interesting. The first quest you are likely to find and not even realize is the only way to get the villagers to accept you is finding an old ladies underwear. This is not the kind of modern game where items unspeakably glimmer when you approach or you have a waypoint telling you exactly where it is. I'd normally consider that a good thing but finding a pair of randomly generated underwear in a game that is mostly made of different colors of brown is not how I would want to spend my gametime doing. There are much more boring quests to be found such as delivering messages to people seemingly hiding from you and discovering which one of the triplet twins is a thief by waiting for one of them to whistle. Each quest giver has the same two or three quests that they will give out time and time again. It is seemingly designed to give you something to do and a from of making money but get so intolerably boring. One thing that is unnecessary is having to go find a street performer to save and have him talk before letting you save. Minor annoyance that adds humor but an annoyance nonetheless.Money is used to buy clothing, items and upgrading your weapons. If you have the materials you can even create and name your own weapons as well as choosing one of multiple fighting stances to take when using that sword. Combat is based around stats, hit points and other other RPG aspects so sword play is not all that great as your weapon is either as effective as if it was inflatable toy sword or makes the fight far too easy. It is no doubt a good feeling seeing your weapons becoming more and more effective so be aware the combat is far more RPG centered than action based. You can parry and beat enemies far better equipped than you though the amount of hits they can take make it clear that you are not supposed to beat them. One combat mechanic I found very interesting is the durability meter for weapons. Depending on how much stress a sword is under from too much blocking or hitting it may break leaving you with just the hilt in your hands and your death likely nigh. It keeps you from simply button mashing and makes the fights feel more tactical. This game suffers from a 30fps lock however which really harms the feel of the combat and the overall game unfortunately.It is a poorly made game with an empty world, uninteresting characters & plot and to top it off that accursed 30 fps lock. Yet it seems to know that it is not all too great and revels in it's weirdness with beat-boxing pedestrians, catgirl companions and old ladies that have the hots for you. Way of the Samurai has a certain uniqueness with it's charming weirdness and all of it's features like being able to attack with the non-lethal blunt end of your sword or just ignore the war entirely and try to get a wife. This is one of those titles that can be is a guilty pleasure which I do want to go and play some more of for some unknown reason."

I never played any of the others, but this is good. However, there are a few things I thought were worth mentioning:1) There are details of the game that aren't very accurate to the culture and time period. If you're big into that kind of thing, I'd recommend setting all that aside and just enjoying the game. :)2) I don't use a controller. Keyboard and mouse all the way. However, this is clearly a port, and so if you're like me, you will have difficulties. As with all games, I'd recommend looking over the controls under the option menu before starting. The controls in WotS3 were harder for me to grasp than usual.3) Yes, the graphics aren't very modern. But for old farts like me (I grew up on Covert Action, Monuments of Mars, Commander Keen, X-Com, etc.), gameplay and creativity far outweigh eye candy. And this game already scores high for me. Overall, a lot of thought was put into it, and freedom for the player was one of the big things they seem to have been shooting for.All in all, I'd give it an 8/10 already!NOTE: When remapping keys, make sure you leave a couple menu keys mapped!

The combat is pretty awesome in wich you actually have to be patient with tough enemies but go ham with the insta kill on weak ones (incredibly satisifying). Build your own sword or spear, customize your accessories, find partners who have unique ways of getting them to work with you, fun side quests (oh dirty Misae you gilf), have everyone greet you by your name, or just kill everyone; this game has it all. The only con is that it is kinda a small map size but it still packs a wallop and with its high replayability you will still get surprised by different things. Dont ruin the fun and use guides just go in and be whatever kinda samurai you wanna be! BELIEVE IT!"

My love goes back to when I was a kid chatting online with friends and the first was highly reccomended when I was much too young to play it. That being said, I've played every WOTS game possible. On consoles WOTS3 was an amazing game with lots of depth. You could be a hero who saves everyone, a bandit who only gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥about themselves, or a merciless mass murderer. All of those options have associated endings by the way. So when I saw that WOTS3 was being ported to PC I was excited. About 15 minutes in, I can tell you the controls are horrible. This is a lazy port by any definition. You will spend most of your time playing trying to figure out/remember what keys are assigned to what. Also the framerate as mentioned in other reviews IS locked at 30, and while you can try to modify it, you will notice gameplay issues. As is, the cracks in the seems of this game are pretty obvious. If they ever fix these issues, I highly reccomend the game. The gameplay is fun, and story is great just due to how many ways you can play it. Unlike WOTS4 this game allows a countering system (Much missed from the sequel IMO). I didn't even bother trying it with these controls though."

Every choice you make determines a lot about your future and opens and closes doors that you won't know exist until you've played the game through multiple times.  Now, there's nothing necessarily wrong with this format, but there should be some sort of warning at the beginning of the game that states that you have to experience each ending to truly appreciate the game because depending on the ending you choose, you could be looking at a 3-hour playthrough with an incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ending that would leave you feeling furious and cheated, especially if you payed full price for the game.  Rest assured: if you play through to every ending, the game is well worth the asking price.Now to be fair, I should note before I begin that I've never played any of the other 'Way of the Samurai' games before.  That being said, I found this game to be addictingly fun, and endearingly quirky in a way only obviously Japanese games with questionable translation and terrible voice acting can be.  Once you get the combat system down, normal sword fighting works pretty well, and the push and pull system of blocks is relatively straightforward.  HOWEVER, if you try to use any more sophisticated combat moves such as kicks or throws, you're♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck.I didn't know that translating the controls of a game from Xbox 360 to PC could be done so horribly.  First off, to even draw your blade, you have to select 'page up' which makes about as much sense as coating your♥♥♥♥♥♥in honey and skull ♥♥♥♥ing the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of a beehive.  Combat is often thrust upon you quickly, leaving you very little time to react before you're being cut to ribbons.  To remedy this, you could just go around with your sword drawn, but this either scares the locals so much they won't trade with you, or makes just about every dumb ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the area with a weapon attack you, so you can't really do that either.  To kick, you have to hold 'page down' while pressing 'e', which requires that you let go of the mouse and leave yourself open to attack.  All the 'page down' button does is block, which is typically done with 'mouse3', but in order to kick, you have to use 'page down' for some strange reason.One other gripe I have is that the framerate is locked in at 30 fps, so there will always be a lag, thus blocking three consecutive strikes from even the lowest opponent is damn near impossible.  Once you get to upper level boss battles, if your weapon doesn't have a high defense rating, the boss will execute some ridiculous, ostensibly unblockable combo attack and take out half of your health in one fell swoop.  Now, this is to be expected, and although it's frustrating at times, it happens rarely enough that it doesn't completely destroy the combat experience.But there is some good news.  The storytelling is fractured and cliché, sure, but thankfully the game relies on storytelling so little that it doesn't really matter.  This game does customization very, VERY well.  You can upgrade swords and spears, or collect parts and create your dream weapon.  Shopkeepers sell different masks and accessories that will offer quite a few cool new looks for your character, and new outfits can be unlocked as you gain samurai points for acting virtuously on every playthrough.  Even though the map is small and you'll probably only get 7 or so hours out of actual storylines, it's still fun for a long time to go around killing other samurai or whomever.Despite its faults, this game is a lot of fun, but I'd still wait for a sale.  7.5/10."

The control system is near impossible to use competantly, with no viable way to reallocate keys without a third hand, and zero controller support to alleviate the issue. The game itself has issues in it's general design, from a lack of any real tutorial level (which all other entries in the series has had), the worst Time Management system in the franchise, and a difficulty curve that is almost non-existent, regardless of whether you're playing on easy or normal difficulty. The Morality system also has many issues, with harsh penalties for certain actions, but never even telling you what you did to deserve that penalty. This game had a lot of potential to be a good game, had certain changes been made, but overall it's a poor game with an even poor-er porting job. Do yourself a favor and buy 4 instead."

If you don't want to bother with any tinkering with files at the behest of interweb wizards, then you probably want to look elsewhere.Original review:Ughhhh... you'd think I'd have learned from Way of the Samurai 4 that Acquire and Ghostlight are terrible with PC ports... sadly it seems that much like them, I have much to learn.Now I loved Way of the Samurai 3 on the 360, it was my overall favorite of the series- 4 had some nice improvements, but as a whole 3 is my favorite, so naturally I was excited when I saw it was seeing a release on Steam... though also reluctant since 4 was pretty glitchy, though after a while they patched it so that it was at least playable (finally adding controller support was nice). So I figured I'd wait a bit until after launch before getting this one, thinking they'd have already patched it... shame about that though.Enter Way of the Samurai 3, I've managed to play for about 2.5 hours of mostly dicking around getting money and not bothering much with triggering events since I wanted to get a better sword ASAP... it's just a shame that it suddenly crashed when I loaded one of the areas I've been to a dozen times already- ok, no problem, I saved fairly recently... it's just a shame that the game crashes whenever I try to load that save, so I've already lost all my progress. I suppose it's fortunate that I've only put less than 3 hours into it, but add insult to injury it now also crashes whenever I try to start a new game so now I can't do anything besides load up the main menu and think of what could be if I could actually play the damn game.I didn't notice any other outstanding glitches in my playtime (other than once it altogether refused my controller's input, but that was solved fairly easily by just restarting the game; and I could never actually catch the sword in swordplay theater despite being fairly good at it on the 360... it just refused to let me catch the damn sword so I always got my face sliced), but then I only had a few hours with it so that doesn't mean much, there's probably more I haven't had the chance to see.Much as I love these games, these guys really don't know what they're doing when it comes to PC ports.  Would not recommend, and just like with 4 it hurts me to say that since I really love these games, it's just the PC ports are so shoddy that I can't recommend them in good conscience."

Secara peribadi, sebagai penggemar era sengoku yang berkaitan, saya suka permainan ini dan mengalahkannya kira-kira sembilan kali. Dengan Way of the Samurai 3 ,anda bebas untuk menyesuaikan watak anda dan cerita anda, apabila anda dapat memilih apa yang anda katakan dan lakukan apabila anda berinteraksi dengan watak-watak yang lain. Ini memberikan banyak pengakhiran yang berbeza kepada permainan dan banyak cara yang berbeza untuk dimainkan. Walau bagaimanapun, terdapat banyak masalah dalam permainan yang masih boleh diperbaiki. Peta terlalu kecil dan merasa terhad, dan permainan dapat dipukul dalam waktu yang sangat singkat. Jika anda adalah peminat cara hidup samurai sebenar, beli permainan ini. Anda akan menyukainya. Jika tidak, anda mungkin mahu menyewanya sebelum membuat sebarang komitmen.This is written in Malay Language since there is no Malay as Language OptionEnglish VersionWay of The Samurai 3 is definitely a unique game. Personally, as a fan of anything samurai related, I loved the game and beat it about five times over. In Way of the Samurai 3 your free to customize your character and your story, as you get to choose what you say and do when you interact with people. This provides for many different endings to the game and many different ways to play. However, there are many areas in the game that could be improved. The map is too small and feels limiting, and the game can be beaten in a very short amount of time. If your a fan of the samurai era, buy this game. You'll love it. Otherwise you may want to rent it before you make any commitments."

Think of the possibilities; taking out the leader of a nation and becoming leader yourself, becoming the emperor's personal protector, killing ninjas, becoming a friend or foe of the people, customizable blades...do you want these features when you think of samurai games?

It seemed like just beyond that wall, or just beyond that building, I would see the rest of the game and, in the words of Mulan, ""get down to business"". I did not, in fact, defeat the huns.You get a tiny map that's barely comprehensible as to where you are and what you're doing, and a tiny village to run around in. I would say there's other villages, but travelling was so tedious and confusing that I gave up before seeing any more villages.The voice acting is ♥♥♥♥ing unbearable. In the first village I went to, everybody hates you for absolutely no reason, and my god do they make sure they let you know. I heard the same damn line six or seven times by passing the same townsperson, and I eventually just murdered her in cold blood because I couldn't stand the sound of her pesky, irritating, anime-esque voice. I wish I hadn't hit her, actually, because she started this banshee wail that was about 347634347643 times worse than the greeting.Where is the story? Where is the part where I'm supposed to get engaged with ANY PART OF THIS GAME?!

The way wots3 is designed is for replayability as each playthrough only takes from 3-5 hours where you then play again trying to get different endings and unlocks. Your character is carried and can be changed each playthrough while still keeping weapons and items. The combat is fun and different while its is a 3rd person hack and slash it is done in a very fun way making each battle feel like it could be your last, you really feel yourself progressing as you get new weapons and better moves and stances. This game is unique there arent really others like it. You really feel like a samurai.Now another subject is this or the 4th which is hard to say this is defintely way more serious than the 4th and has some gameplay changes but the 4th is way more polished and while it has less endings thers way more todo in it plus you control when times moves by doing events or resting in this it moves on its own so you can mess up alot easier wots3 also holds your hand alot less than wots4"
