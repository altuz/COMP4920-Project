,Not Recommended,427570,28144620,"Posted: 2 December, 2016",all,Mcrobit,"This is an edited review after I came back to play this game since new updates and patches have gone through.If you take a gander at my library I have everything from Sins of the Solar Empire, to the X series, and EU4/HOI/Stellaris. I enjoy space games and galaxy builders immensely, from simple RTS to grand strategy. Dawn of Andromeda falls somewhere between a very simple RTS with a sprinkle of 4X thrown into it. The core game is executed nicely and they have added quality of life designs, such as being able to manage through your planets on one screen.I would like to do a step by step comprehensive break down of the game but I can not bear myself to play through it. In my opinion, this game is summed up in the first 10-15 minutes of gameplay. It is perhaps that I have played through and been spoiled by many great titles that Dawn of Andromeda feels lackluster. I have yet to find anything that grabs me. Not to say that it is a bad game, but what it delivers feels to be a very safe game design with simplistic goals. Even when constructing a grand civilization with a giant fleet, the game seems as a very simple version of games on the market. Its clean, simple, crisp, and easy to play. However its just that, its simple. I would reccomend this as an introduction to 4X games. I have known Iceberg to make some great space 4X games with strategy and depth. I am spinning my head as to why they made a simple one as this. You can cycle through the pictures on the store page and see everything the game has to offer in as little as 8 pictures. I am not sure on the long term plan or goal of this project however, I still do not give my reccomendation on this game, at least not at this time. In the future when maybe a bit of depth is added I will change my mind. Until then I will keep watch on this project.TLDR: The game is not great, but it is not bad. A solid 80 out of 100 and as they say, 80 pays the rent.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Really wish there was a not at this time button rather than a simple yes or no. Currently this game is bare bones and needs work with fixes here and there. It feels like I do a lot of clicking for no reason, moving from planet to planet to adjust spending money on infrastructure is a pain The game is a good concept, I DO enjoy the game, but it needs work. Give it some time, they have a plan with major updates roughly once a month with smaller fixes scatterd between, check back in either January or Feb, put this on a watchlist, I reccomend not buying this one (currently) unless you want to support the development."

Would be good see a more clear resource gathering options, mining stations etc.. Battles look good but need more ship designs!! Alien races look fantastic and there are plenty of diplomatic options although at this stage in the early access i think they are bugged. Overall this certainly is a promising game, reminded me of Sins of a Solar Empire, which can only be a good thing."

They are big, appealing and at first taste so so delicious, yet ultimately are finished too soon because guys and girls, and not to state it too on the nose.....hollow.Whats Good: Graphics, Ambience, interface....the gameplay is intuitive, and it doesnt need you to have played any game before for a novice to pick up the mechanics.Whats Bad: Absolutely nothing......yet everything....its not enough. its too simplistic....yeah yeah yeah I know micromanagement is the biggest bugbear of all 4x games, yet please allow us some variance in our colonies, a reason for having this or that planet. At the mo all the races seem to like the same habitability, so you ultimatley fight over the same terrain for not much of a variance in the colony. It all blends into a land grab to build up economy and military, and then bash the enemy over the head with your new toys. Oh and speaking of your vast armadas, well there is two ways of doing that; build alot, send and smash...wash, rinse, repeat, or build smart....build a tank or two to micromanage and support with a group of missile boats.....the AI allwyas targets your tanks leaving your boats to obliterate even the toughest of foes......pirates no longer hold a threat.I give this the thumbs up because of what it could be.....just like Stars in Shadow this has so much potential.....but please, please, please for (insert preferred diety or profanity) give this some depth, nuances, creamy soft caramel filling or at least some M&Ms (US)/Smarties (UK) for use to get our sugar high from. MOO 1&2 gave us starship tag, Homeworld gave us ships we cared about, Sins of Solar empire, gave us real time thrill of battle.......this could be all of this and so so much more without compromising its simple game interface and playstyle.Go to it Greywolf"

The politics and diplomacy are somewhat random each game (based on the 5 council members you pick from the start based on a random pool, their traits will determine your focus and direction for the whole game) and I particularly like the surveying and artefacts aspect of exploration.The music is fantastic, the other races look great. For a strategy game, it is incredibly immersive compared to what I'm used to. But again, the only think similar I've played is Sins, which is pretty old.That's all I have to say for now. If you like space and RTS games, you should like it."

Meaning only habitability rating matters, no distinction is made between oceania, desert, ice, gas etc.  If it is listed as habitable you can colonize.Ship design needs a little more depth I feel.In depth is not necessary to be a good game but some level of depth is needed to make it feel more immersive."
,Recommended,427570,29131821,Posted: 8 January,all,ChanceV™,"The game is awesome it is more than what I expected, the RTS style fits so much better than the TBS (Endless Space,  but is also fun) the ablity to start to micro manage the colonys is on the way to what would be the best RTS of all time for me. Its still early access so it does crash every now and then but that is to expected from a game still in development ( their autosave feature saves quite frequently so your game shouldn't be to far behind after a crash). On another note if any of the devs read this, the one thing that would make this the game ive dreamed of would be if you could actually build the buildings in the colonys yourself with a build menu like Starcraft 2, and placement style of Sim City, Tropico, Starcraft 2 or something similar or just placement spaces of sorts but also keep the investment tabs to make it so only certain things can be built with a certain ammount of invesment points, and when riots happen on your planets you can get the option to go down and contol the riot yourself with the RTS style that you have with the ships or something more simpified. but that is what would make this game the game ive been dreaming of. 9/10 for now. Thanks for Reading and if you read this and agree with my idea with the colonys could you give this a thumbs up so maybe a dev can see this Review. Thanks Again."

I assume the quality of the planet allows you to eye ball it but it is still guess work and some of the random events include spawning a minor civ or hostile fauna both result in a lost colony ship.- Economics is basic and boring you have strategic resources which give empire wide bonuses but once you have access to them thats it you have access. You can ""trade"" for them if an empire is selling them at one of there planets but they do not have an amount value so one empire can sell to the entire galaxy and gain a large economic advantage.- The prices the things scale way faster than you can reasonably earn anything and to acheive an ecnomic victory is the easiest way to win which is just shocking considering that 12 units can cost you 10k credits and by that time you are in the end game.- Travel is slow which by itself is not a bad thing but coupled with everything else just grinds the game to a snails pace that just never picks up.-Combat is uninventive and just amounts to you line up your ships and they attack each other untill one side wins. You can put MODs on your ships to give them certain advantages or abilities which when used can actually turn the tide of a battle which is really nice. The whole thing though just feels lacking, the fleets can never be as big as you want them to be, the battles them selves are basically turn based and tactics are purely based on your mods. Flanking attacking from behind just dosent matter when ships can turn on a dime anyway and have full 360 combat.planet management is booring and uninspiring it just investing in one of 5 branches of infrastructer and leveling it up... that is it. No unique buildings no quirk on the planets themselves. The quality of the planet effects the max pop you can have on it but that is it.Diplomacy i didnt really play around with because in my entire game no one declared war on me even though i had 12 planets so i dont even know what to say to it at all.Over all the game tries to be your standard space empire RTS game... and fails it dosent exel at anything to draw you in and every other feature is medicore or feels unfinished."

Graphically it looks beautiful, but the gameplay is too shallow to be anything more than an entry-level 4x title, it's so streamlined it practically plays itself.

,Not Recommended,427570,28242382,"Posted: 7 December, 2016",all,XboxOneNoob,"My Problem With The Game:So far I've enjoyed the game quite well, so why would I not recommend this game? How Ram intensive it is. I know you might be saying ""If you don""t run the recommened you should not be playing the game"", but currently the recommened ram is 8 GB, and I'm using 16 GB ram and yet it still caps it off. Ram build really heavy into late game, and any saves you had in the game render your game unplayable if the game crashes, because unless you play again with a beefy ram of 32 GB, it still won't work. So far both time I've gotten to end game my run is cut short due to Ram contraints. I've tried lowering the graphics (lol), but that's not where the ram usage comes from. I have a hard time figuring out anyone running the recommended to could finish a playthrough, much less the ""minimum"". All I have to say is that the game at this point is unplayable for me, even after the update today that was supposed to mend the Ram crashes people have been having..Game In General:As for the game concept, I absolutely love it. All elements of the game seemed well thought out and polished (except trading, I found it completely useless and diplomatic A.I). I'm sure this game will eventually be a title to challenge all the other 4x's, Hell I'd even argue that it's one of the best out there. Ingame mechanics all seem useful, and none seem forced into gameplay. The only real thing I can see myself complaining about is how useless the tech tree is. If you really wanted to you don't need to research anything to win the game, or if you do research it's not really going to massively affect gameplay (outside of how much other dudes are willing to pay for it). The game is also really friendly right now for new players, as alot of the mechanics are not too complicated though I can see why many would say the game looks too superficial.Specific Things:Now there's a few games I still have to do before I can say how worth it it is. I'VE NEVER COMPLETED THE GAME, as I said in my personal problem with the game bit. I've never been able to recover the body or scavenge any of those guardian things or beasts, it always says for me that It was too messed up to scavenge. I've never found out the fossils (not for lack of trying, after researching I find nothing) and I've never researched all of the tech tree. I've only played up until the first glitch patch of the game. If the game could run on my computer I would say the price tag is fair, but it can't. Overall at THIS STAGE OF THE GAME I would give it a 8/10 considering you can run it."

I am excited to see what comes out of this game.

Also, easy can kill you if you choos the wrong starting option.Looking through the codex, it's a painfully horrible read filled with grammatical and syntax errors that need to be fixed. Lore for a game should be easily read, digested and applied or appreciated. This Codex was an utter joke. - for that.... - - --- (seriously).There's no editor that I can find for the galactic map, ""Huge"" for gameplay is about the equivalent of small or medium in Sins of a Solar Empire.

76561198009625167,Not Recommended,427570,34541156,Posted: 27 August,all,yazah,"I purchased this on sale (35% off - $20) a few months after release (and after a few updates fixing several problems other people may have noted).Overall, this is an ok game, however I wouldn't recommend it over any of the similar games in the genre. It plays most similar to Sins of a Solar Empire (semi-realtime, not turn based), but lacks the depth. And I don't mean like min-max depth, I mean everything is super basic. Building ships is just adding a new widget in a generic interface. Adding buildings is just putting bubbles into the civic category. Research is extremely linear.  There's also no auto-management for settlements, so you have to go update everything yourself every time, otherwise it'll stop growing.On top of all of that, the game is relatively boring (you only unlock two planet types during the game, so there's not much new settling/expansion mid-game), and most things are capped (total research is capped, savings are capped, etc). So even if you do expand or build a successful empire, it doesn't really matter. After a certain point, bigger gets you nothing. There's a lot of design decisions that really limit the strategy options, which makes the game far less interesting.Combat also sucks. The interface doesn't allow you to easily select ships to use their abilities, so more often than not you are either trying to micro ships, or you just let them slug it out hoping the terrible AI will keep all your ships at least attacking an not just sitting idle (even though they are in aggresive mode) watching their friends get shot.Aside from that, the game seems to run slow. Zooming was choppy. The interface seems to lag. There were no bugs or crashes that I experienced, but it wasn't smooth either. And the music is fairly dull.Overall, not terrible. 5/10. But I wouldn't recommend this over any other space 4x game currently available. Also, I wouldn't pay more than $15 - $20 for it if you did decide to purchase."

Such as the Athis who have a charming habbit of befriending people they intend to invade and eventually go Borg on everyone and spread across the galaxy like a plague.It's beautiful and the sounds are quite nice. The only issues I've really encountered is that Missiles/Torpedo's have a habbit of not actually hitting targets depending on your vessels distance from the enemy. Long range shots generally hit.

That being said, the devs are active with their patches/updates and the game gets better every week.  It won't take long for this game to surpass other 4xs like Stellaris.  Even in this early stage, it already runs better than most 4x games."

This game is just my cup of tea. Reminds me of Sins of a solar empire with more exploration and emphasis on non-combat strategic options (diplomacy, politics etc...). Just needs a bit more variety in ship design and weapons, the removal of few bugs and this game will rock."

This game is very similar to Stellaris but cheaper and in my opinion it has a higher potential than Stellaris. If this was NBA2K17 I would say that this game has a potential rating of an A. It is very simple to play but yet very challenging. I can't wait for updates that add even more content and really can't wait till this game is released because then it will contain so many awesome features. This game is the perfect combination of all the 4x Space games that were released this year so far. If you like Civ 5 or Civ 6 than you will really enjoy this game. The only thing I wish they would change is the game constantly going. Also it would be nice to sort through all your units faster. All in All this game is great for being recently released and being in Early Access.

They seem to be ""guns blazing"" to make this game better fast.With my short attention span, I'm also amazed that I am still playing this game 4 months later. I have not been able to focus on one game for so long since the earlier Civs (NOT the latest one), the first Skyrim or my first crush in High School. Heh!*******************************************************************************************************It’s rather nicely done for an Early Access release.What I like about the game so far is that it has a simple (in ease of operation) and elegant interface.Unlike many 4x games, the screen and play are not too “busy” and it is actually quite relaxing to play. So far, it seems like a game that is fun to play without seeming like a “second job” in the amount of effort one must put into coordinating your holdings."

Examples: systems are needlessly limiting where you can travel, attributes of your empire and characters are simplistic. Further, there are little nusiances, like not letting you set your colony ships auto-explore.Alltogether, a dull game."

The game is different in many ways to other 4x games, and has very few bugs, and no game-breaking bugs from what I have seen. Other reviews that have complaints, do so as a way to blame the game for their own mistakes, instad of accepting their own shortcomings.This game is not perfect though, and has some flaws, dome of which are working as designed, and cause the game to have a lower ceiling of fun, than other games do. These of course are personal preferences, and you may actually like the way they designed the game to work, so i won't list them here.Yes the auto-save feature seems to be corrupted, so you have to manually save the game to be able to load and continue your games. This sucks, and although is very annoying, I don't see it as game-breaking.Most negative reviews seem to want to harp on the fact that the game does not have as many features as other 4x games, maybe compared to Civ 6 or the like. Those games I am sure they are comparing this game too, are fully released, are in late beta with most of their features implimented. This game is very fresh, just released into EARLY ACCESS, where the devs have decided to release the game without all features, so that the player base can HELP the dev team in designing the game, and deciding which features should be added.If you want to play a game and just have some fun, go away, this game, and nearlly all Early ACCESS games are not for you.  This game is VERY PLAYABLE however, but does need more things added, which the dev team, I am sure, is more than happy to listen to your opinion on. If you want this game to turn out the way that you wished so many other 4x games would have, then support this game, and help the dev team decide what this game needs. The game is stable, and that is nearly unheard of for Early Access. The price point is low enough that you are not blowing money for a full price game, but honestly from what they have said, this game will be about as close to a triple A title as you can get, without coming from one of the big boys."

The two games are practically the same, except stellaris is actually a finished, functioning, and enjoyable game.

,Recommended,427570,31556479,Posted: 5 May,all,BlueOrange,"This game is quite significantly improved since my original review.  Ticking the 'camera smoothing' box has corrected the visual problems that I was having.  Improvements to the fleet management UI and other aspects of the user experience mean that I've enjoyed returning to it.There are a number of clever and innovative ideas in this game - the Outlaws, a novel approach to R&D, and a focus on meaningful decisions in colony management with less clutter than many other games.  It's also very pretty.I haven't tested the full experience out and I'm not sure how battles will work, but the developer did send me a message saying that they'd try to address my concerns, and as far as I can tell, they succeeded.  Given the influence that this review seems to have, I felt I should let people know that it's improved without delay.--- Original 'do not recommend' review (118 of 137 found it helpful - 86%) ---Dawn of Andromeda has a lot going for it, with one very serious drawback: it isn't fun to play.There are quite a few clever ideas here, but headache-inducing graphical 'features' (having the camera wobble after you've moved it is cute the first time, nauseating the thousandth) and under-developed UI suck the enjoyment out of it.Theoretically, this is a game much like Stellaris, except that the game mechanics are streamlined, so you can get in and play it quicker, without quite so much fiddling about.  Ultimately, this is a shallower game than Stellaris, where you spend four times as much effort completing routine tasks, and ultimately more time to achieve less.I really want to enjoy this game, and hope to change my review to a 'recommend' after playing a version that doesn't make me want to throw up (seriously, the camera gets glitchy and induces motion sickness) and doesn't make me want to scream in frustration when all I want to do is order a ship to go to the system where I received a notification.  (Let's not start about 'checking the status of the minor races'.)"
