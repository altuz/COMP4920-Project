A Noob Mode could have two fathers. A Pro Mode could have two babies, one waking up shortly after the other. There are locked doors around the house, so I figure there will be new rooms pretty soon. Maybe a Bedtime Mode, where you have to get the baby back to bed without waking the mom. The possibilties for this game are endless and I really hope to see this game do well.My Review: 11/10"

,Not Recommended,427730,22968919,"Posted: 13 May, 2016",all,Caladell,"I'd have to say, if you're interested in this, do not buy it, at least not now.Bought it a while ago for my son and I to play, after he was watching a let's play of it. Seemed like a goofy game to mess around with.It is, actually.For maybe a round or two.When we first got it, it had issues, but hey, it's early access, right? Well, as each update came out, it seemed like there were more and more issues. Weird lag, objects not working, getting stuck, random people joining our password protected custom game, etc.Then, out of nowhere, it's 'released'. I'm sorry, but this game is NOT ready for release.Not sure where to begin.How about performance? Pretty abysmal. Can be running smooth, but then the framerate just plummets, mouse movement is all jerky, and it just feels rough.Graphics-Quite poor. I'm not one to judge a game by it's graphics by any means, but overall, the game just looks bad. Looks like the devs just slapped it together and called it good. Character models are atrocious (hats and glasses are humorous though), textures are all over the place. Some look fine, but others don't make any sense. Go outside and look at the achievement room. The room is flat, but the 'bricks' taper off. Good example of it being slapped together.Controls-Serviceable I suppose, although picking up items and using them is a major chore.Balance-absolutely ridiculous. It's not a matter of who is going to win? The baby or the daddy? It's a matter of if the baby dies in one minute or two. The daddy has only a couple things he can do to stave off the baby's death, but there are sooo many options for the baby to off itself, it quickly turns into a race to see just how fast the baby can kill itself, especially with warping through vents.Idea/concept-brilliant. Actually a really good idea for a game, but there are so many issues right now, I'd stay away. We'll probably keep playing it off and on for a while to see if things improve, but it's quickly becoming tiresome.One thing I forgot about, and just remembered. The soundtrack. One of the most annoying and grating soundtracks I've ever heard."

,Recommended,427730,21698144,"Posted: 7 March, 2016",all,Atratzu,"-Quick Review-Who's Your Daddy is genre I'd like people to start using called ""Creepy Simulator"", on par with the games: ""What's under your blanket !?"" and ""Shower With Your Dad"".If we're speaking specifically, it's a competitive, co-op game between a baby and father, the person controlling the baby is trying to kill himself or herself, while the father frantically runs around trying to keep the baby from death's grip.-Detailed breakdown review-StoryThere's not much to say about the game's story, however *I* have a number of stories from playing the game. I purchased this game to play it with my younger brother, and then laughed until I cried at all the hilarious events that took place.To all of my friends who sent me messages saying ""oh god, that game""; instead of judging me from afar, you should have joined my twitch stream and laughed along with me(because my brother is so much more funnier then me).From setting myself on fire as a baby, predicting what my brother was going to do, and hearing his frustrated screams of ""don't give me those pills! Keep that apple away from me!"", it really was a hilarious stream.Gameplay:WARNING!!!!I'm not going to spoiler tag my whole review, but lets say this game is way more fun when you don't know very much about the mechanics of the game. Grab two copies of this game, grab a friend, skype, and enjoy.   Read on if you don't mind having basic gameplay spoiled.I have already explained the gist of the game. If you're the father: you try to keep your child alive by moving dangerous objects away, and giving pills and fruit to your child to keep them healthy until mom gets home! As the baby your objective is to get yourself killed in one of the very many MANY ways of doing so, drowning, freezing, burning, poison, power outlets, and more that are still being added (03/07/16) as the game updates.Some may criticize the game on it's graphics, or glitches that may happen while playing. Naturally in most games this would be a negative quality, but there's a hilarious novelty about the game, and it's not over priced for the entertainment.Achievements:There are no steam achievements at this time. This is a game which would be fun to have ""dumb achievements"", just so achievers can grab an easy 100%, since the game at this time is purely 1v1 co-op, an achievement for each death would be very easy to teach people the various ways you can die, or power ups you can unlock as the father.Price:Who's Your Daddy is priced at $4.99, now I normally grade games by 1 dollar for every hour played, but for this game I make an exception. The quality of laughter and company of my brother over ruled the standard rule.At this time I've spent two and a half hours playing the game. I have no doubt as the game is updated we will continue to play it occasionally, so even in price and hour the game will probably make it!Conclusion:There's not much else to say about the game, the developer has already made a great game, and we can all look forward to seeing what other madness will be added to the game, and hopefully the developers don't get picked up by child support services before the game comes out of Early Access.I recommend this game for anyone to play with another friend (if you have a funny friend, it's even better), if you're generally a solo gamer this is a skip for you."
,Recommended,427730,20414689,"Posted: 8 January, 2016",all,Sickwhitehawk,I think game is great (No one will read this :(
,Recommended,427730,20265797,"Posted: 3 January, 2016",all,Cypher,"NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS OF THE EARLY ACCESS VERSION AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS VERSIONS ARE RELEASED.(Written as of....Alpha V0.3.0. Can't wait for the update this friday!)The game right now is fun but has issues. The gameplay is rather simple. One player is a baby who must die before time runs out (I think it's 4 minutes.) while the dad must keep him safe.Now while the gameplay has evolved over the versions (Pills used to heal baby too and were infinite.) the game has some serious balance issues. I was able to play for about an hour as baby (I'd leave and make a new lobby each time so I'm always baby.) and was able to win every time, often before the first 30 seconds. Forks spawn near the crib and you can easily jump up, grab it, and use it on an outlet to die instantanously. If a hammer is on the TV stand you can smash the coffee table and eat the glass to die quick too.Daddy gameplay is fun too but it seems very easy to shut baby away from harm if you know where to look. (Put knives and forks on sofa, etc.)The main ways to die as Baby are either electrocution by outlet or poisoning (Glass works the fastest.) drowning or cooking yourself in the oven takes too long and can be easily stopped by Daddy, which should be made faster.The game also has technical flaws. Often the countdown before a match starts glitches and I have to alt F4, but it's rare. (I get it often enough I'll complain on the review though.)The house has alot of rooms locked (WIP stuff not added yet.) so I can't say for the finished state yet. It might be more balanced and fair if more rooms are involved (there's literally no reason to go upstairs currently. Nothing dangerous spawns up there aside from power outlets you can use to zap yourself, and there's no falling damage. There is a funny♥♥♥♥♥♥♥hidden in the bedroom though.) but it's hard to say. I know the next update adds ventilation shafts and more chores Daddy can do.Speaking of the chores, they're not easy. Putting all toys away takes a good deal of time and by the time you're distracted doing that Baby often offs himself. Finding the smoke detector battery is iffy. Sometimes I swear it doesn't spawn at all, which might be a glitch. (Or maybe I'm not looking hard enough.) The next update adds more chores and daddy powers. Doing the chores gives you daddy powers like being able to see Baby through walls or see objects through walls, or be invisible to baby.Now for the main question, is it worth the 5 dollars? Honestly, yes. The game has serious potential to be amazing with more features which are coming soon.EDIT: It's been a long time since I came back, but here I am! This section was written after the outside update was released.The game was expanded. Baby's crib was moved to the bedroom, then it was moved to the baby's room which was previously locked upstairs.New rooms include a garage where you can blow yourself up with a car or set yourself on fire with gasoline, an office room upstairs, a shower upstairs with chemicals for baby to drink or burn in the shower, a laundry room with a washer and dryer for baby to die in, and an outside area with a pool.They added weapons for the baby and daddy like a taser or a ball blaster, etc. You can now drop the toaster in water and get electrocuted, or blow up a fork in the microwave. New chores include cooking for the baby, washing him, etc.Family Gathering mode was added, which allows 8 players. You now have achievements and can get hats for doing them.However, the game is now out of early access. They added music which many people have complained about, but I actually like the music just fine.I have one major issue. The game wasn't ready for release yet! With the newest update, the game is broken! After Baby kills himself, the game doesn't seem to recognize it. You're forced to spectate until time runs out, and Daddy basically wins by default after time runs out.Also, some achievements are broken. I swear I've spent an entire match just playing with the piano and the achievement didn't pop.Is the game still worth the money? Maybe. But the developer needs to get his act together and fix these bugs! How did this pass playtesting? The ""Game doesn't recognize Baby dying."" bug literally happens every time, and it breaks the game! it's been a few days (At least 3) and the developer didn't release a hotfix or anything!It shouldn't have left early access yet.Buy it if you want, but keep in mind in it's current state it still feels early access, and has game breaking bugs."
,Recommended,427730,19897588,"Posted: 23 December, 2015",all,Mally,"What started out as a joke onFunnyjunk.comfrom a despised, sad cat man, turned into the family friendly game of the year. ""Who's Your Daddy"" is the sleeper hit of 2015, the brain child of Thehumanidiot, turning decades of volunteer dad work into a full hands on simulated experience.The goal of 'Who's your daddy' is to make sure that your spawnling doesn't remove himself from the gene pool too quickly (High School is the most appropriate time for this.) You do this by making sure that the baby can't eat dozens of batteries, stick forks into electrical sockets, and drinking blue juice under the sink. Alternatively, if you are playing as the baby character, it's your job to be as much of a little♥♥♥♥♥♥as humanly possible. This is more choice than a Telltale video game.The graphics are nothing to write home about. The dad is a heteronormative cis white male, with the baby able to change its appearance based on what actions it has undertaken. It's possible to turn the baby into Shrek if you eat too much blue juice, for example.The soundtrack consists of one song that constantly loops. It is actually the newest hit single by young money rapper Drake, where he dances like a complete bozo on film. The song plays in the main menu, and from the in game radio, a statement of how every single song on the radio is exactly the same. Not only are we treated to a parent trainer, we also have a strong message about the media today.All in all, 'Who's your Daddy' is an ideal game for anyone that wants to have a nice friendly game. The price is cheap, the graphics inducing nostalgia, and the gameplay is simple yet effective. I fully anticipate when we're treated with 'Who's your Daddy' at EVO 2016."

I can't wait to see future updates, there are SO much things that can be added into this game, like going outside. I'm either garbage at the game, or that being the Father is hard to win. The baby can teleport through vents, taze their father, eat batteries quickly, and such, while the father can barely do anything. There should be a buff for the Dad.AT THE MOMENT (Feb. 1st 2016):Pro's:-Online-Supports controller usage-Wide range of platforms (PC, Mac, etc)-Good concept, future updates can hold alot of potential-Time killerCon's:-Dad is useless (like I said, it could just be me. I only played for 10 minutes.)-Repetitive-Not much to do-Should add voicechat-No single player (should be able to verse bots)-If you have no friends, your screwed. Online people are not too fun to play with at times, and usually rageThere should be more settings as well, such as more houses, only outdoors, in the garage, etc.The possibilites are endless. What I want are different gamemodes. Here are some I came up with:-Nightmode: Basically the same but it's night. There should be things removed and added for this mode-Co-op: 2 babies or 2 Dads working together-Store: Your baby is at the store, loose. There also should be stranger interaction. Careful Dad, might not want to foot the bill-Park: There should be other babies helping you, or maybe not...8)-Amusement Parks: Yes! Rollarcoasters, mini-games, more things to do, and easier to get lost at! *Imagine a baby in bumper cars*Obviously, my modes aren't that creative and not that good, but just some ideas that could turn out well if used properly.Overall, this game is pretty good, espically since it's in it's early development state. This would probably be a 7/10 at the moment. Like I said before, future updates are probably going to be amazing! Can't wait to see what the developers have to offer! So get this game and enjoy! :)"

The game's concept is fairly simple, in which one player plays as a baby and tries to kill themself using a variety of household objects, while the other player controls a dad trying to protect the baby, providing a shockingly realistic portrayal of actual parenthood. There are a variety of ways for the baby to kill themself, like eating batteries or dropping a toaster in the sink, giving the game replayability by challenging yourself to kill yourself in creative ways. The dad gets various objects to try to protect the baby, like a tool to lock drawers and a baby grabbing handle to temporarily pick up the baby, and can also do chores around the house to get powerups like Dad Bod, which allows you to carry heavier things. The game is only in alpha right now, but the developer seems to be fairly diligent in adding regular updates that add new features and ways to die, and at five dollars per copy I think it's a pretty good game to get together with a friend and have a few hours of laughter."

BUT as much as i would like this game, it has more bugs than the Goat simulator, is unballanced as hell, the father walks as fast as a grand grand granpa, the animations of the dad are simply not there at all...Minor bugs are no problem, but most of the time i can't walk after i wrote something in the ingame chat.After each game we had to pray that the replay button works... But sometimes was not pressable, or not there at all.Most certainly we just had to wait until the time was up, even while the baby was cooked and well done in the oven a long time ago.The ballancing is a joke, because the baby wins always.... (except after he used the ingame chat und had to stay in place until mom came home). There are many ways to kill you instantly, or like the bathtube where the baby can start the water ever and ever until it dies.  And since you can't stop the baby from crawling wherever it wants, the pool is the best area to die for sure.Since the items are placed completely random (which is a good idea!) it isn't even possible to take the kid out of the pool with the holder.... or to find the antidot when it drank poison....He walks so awfully slow, you can't even open 4 drawers, and the baby is in the next room smashing the table with a hammer (strong baby, huh?) and eating the glass... now you can't stop it from that, it's a goner.Please fix the walking bugs first, the whole internet is filled of complainings.Then ballance it properly. Since the baby goes through the ventilation it kills itself in the bathtub before we even reach downstairs."

Because the lack of parenting seen in this game is horrifying!------------------------------------------------------------GameplayIn a game that closely resembles cat and mouse antics, you are tasked with the objective either committing or preventing a suicide. Sounds dark, right? It is.Who's Your Daddyis a unique game that throws you into a 1v1 match against a son and his father. As the baby, you will attempt to kill yourself through any means possible. See that fork over there? Yeah, jab it in the outlet. That bleach looks quite tasty, too. Yum!Are you a good enough father to prevent said death? Baby proof the whole place and keep your child alive. Test yourself in this humourously dark game.GraphicsThis game isnotin Early Access anymore (updated, thanks Beruka) but, in my opinion, feels like it is. There are so many graphical glitches, sometimes it just gets downright annoying. You will fall through the Earth randomly or see abnormal human features (which brings new meaning to the phrase ""knees to chest! Knees to chest!""). This is just naming a few things though...AudioCute scuffling sounds, squeaky toys, and an annoying soundtrack. This pretty much sums up the noise that isWho's Your Daddy. As the game progresses you will eventually forget about the repetitive music, but if you're the type of gamer who notices everything... just turn it off. It's quite annoying.---------------------------------------------------------Pros+ Straight-forward mission: no gimmicks or confusion+ Great multiplayer (some of the most fun that I've had with my friends)+ Various other features that allow you to explore the game more (Daddy's Little Mistakes, etc.)+ Cute sound effects that really compliment the game; soundtrack was annoying over time though+ There are people to play with (online), but I'd recommend playing with friends to avoid aggressive trollsNeutral± It would be nice if we could spawn in random locations instead of just in the same spots. This way it throws off the repetitive nature of the game and it's more challenging. As it stands, my friend can just stand outside the door at the ready for meCons- Like stated previously, this game has some graphical issues. You will fall through the Earth sometimes and it just gets irritating. Nothing that a ""quit"" button can't fix, but hopefully this gets polished soon- Easy to troll whomever is the baby; my friend and I had a go at one another where we just kept holding each other hostage. Perhaps a ""pick up"" timer could be implemented? If there is one, then I never noticed it because I legit held my friend until the game ended---------------------------------------------------------This game is a great game to play with friends.

It worked well and although winning as a baby was easier for newer players, having a good knowledge of the house made victory very possible for the dad.With the recent updates however, the house is so big that the dad cannot possibly anticipate the baby's moves, which is kinda the point of the game. I could baby proof the downstairs rooms while the baby teleports outside and drowns in the pool, or I could baby sit the pool and let the baby die in the kitchen. What the games now come down to is now the daddy's are forced to stand over the baby at all times, and if the baby manages to poison themselves you are forced to leave them behind while you find the medicine. During this time the baby can then instantly die or hide with very little chance of recovery for the dad. The solution to this was that the daddy could pick up the baby, but this kills the fun of the game. The daddy can pick up the baby, take him out front, and just wait out the clock and he'll win every time. Overall the game is somehow OP for both the daddy and the baby and just isn't fun to play anymore. If I made this game I'd make the newer rooms entirely separate maps. With the way it is right now though, I just can't recommend the game."

Mainly:- Items no longer drop where mouse is aiming and instead drop at your feet (which makes placing baby gates and putting dangerous items up on shelves next to impossible)- When daddy is able to pick up baby he can then drop it outside map or in walls so it is stuck- Daddy can use the smoke detector battery multiple times to get all powerups immediately (more than ~5 and game crashes)- Cooking for baby chore is broken and instead now grants the powerup that nuke the pills gives- The new animals defecate 2x every time they defecate (which is a lot) which makes it next to impossible to keep away from baby- Pets go through walls to get to you even if you lock them in a room or outside- Baby STILL cannot drown after taking off the inflatable ring (old bug that still hasn't been addressed)- Custom games with more than 2 players often has everybody vanish/disconnect silently (another old bug still unfixed)I've been waiting a few weeks to see if any of these bugs would be addressed, however there hasn't even been any acknowledgement of the bugs (that I've seen) let alone any fixes.  Until this and quite a few other bugs mentioned in the other reviews are fixed, I would hold off buying to see if the devs are going to commit to fixing these issues or if they are leaving it as is.Recommendation for devs:  Put a pause on adding new features for now and concentrate on fixing bugs.Also recommend: Have baby/daddy role switch every round when you are paired up with someone from match-making."

This game can get boring if you have played a few rounds, but it is super funny and if you have some good friends to play this game with, it can actually be a really funny, interesting and enjoyable game! There is one this i would change if i could and that is how it is so easy for the baby to die. Most of the rounds i play last for 1-2 minutes because all i have to do is walk down the stairs and eat all the batterys or open the cupboard and drink the bleach then, BOOM, dead in 15 seconds. I don't mind it that much because it is still a super fun game but it would be cool if you could find a way to make the rounds last longer.

They just made so many play options that now the population of players online are spread about. I think many people can agree with me when I say, 'Yeah, it does take a while to join a match.' I'm basing my real opinion on the actual game, not how easy/hard it is to find a match. The play style is unique to this game where one player has to kill themselves as quickly as possible, while the other player scrambles about frantically trying to keep the other one alive.

Example: as the baby grab the piano, get on top of it, then  move and jump. You will legit fly. If you go under tables, you can make the table fly. I made table fly, 12/11 would play again.Table flying action is a much relief to when drinking bleach, drowning yourself, and electrifying yourself become a bore.This game is also possibly the only situation when you would ever say ""Oh crap, I drowned myself too quickly.

IF YOU CAN FIND IT.The cabinet locks are freaking useless, unless you find and put the key out of reach by the time the baby finds it, you're doomed.In my opinion, the baby simply has TOO MANY ways to counter what the dad does.Dad's chours are pointless too, by the time you clean up, or change batteries in fire alarms - The baby has drank the bleach, cleaning fluid, and another cleaning product that is strangely placed in a child accessible cupboard in EVERY ROOM ( Excluding the bedroom)At the moment, the game is simply too one sided to the child to be worth £4.00.A 4/10.

It's SO fun.Okay, here we go.Who's Your Daddy is a game where you either take the role of a father or son. The son tries to kill himself in many different horribly scarring ways. The father tries to stop him. One of the problems I have with it, though, is that the game is biased WAY towards the baby. The dad can just get lucky, and he can't go through vents or anything. The baby has so many different ways to kill himself, and the only way he can really be stopped is by getting really lucky and trapping him until 4:00 rolls around.I really shouldn't care, it's a game about a suicidal infant who can douse himself in gasoline and light himself on fire.But still, there are some issues with that.

While you can only be the father, I still feel like it gets the job done. However, I am very confused on why in a parent simulator you would need to simulate being the baby. I guess it just helps you get the feel being both sides. Man, being a parent is much harder than I thought, whenever I joined a multiplayer lobby, the baby somehow kills itself everytime. I would start doing some chores, and then it would somehow eletricute itself, as if it wanted to die... :/After playing this game, I realized something I am not meant to be a parent.

This is so easy that you always win, because there are forks, breakable glass, and poisonus items everywhere. Meaning all you need to do is eat something, hide, wait, and you win.As the daddy, you must babyproof everything, which is very hard, because there is stuff everywhere, so much, that you won't have enough time before the baby gets to one.The reason this game is ""good"" is because of the randomness. I mean, its, its, just play it, I can't explain it.Its great for everyone, even minecraft youtubers with clickbait titles and thumbnails.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------That was my old review. Before it's ""release"".This game has gone to CRAP.Its gone to a buggy mess, glitches everywhere.Most of the time, it bugs out, not working.Win as baby, game doesn't quit.Win as daddy, baby calls you a hacker.The creator said there would be multiple modes in the ""full release""There is only two. One is normal, and boring, the other is chaos, where no one stays on the server.So. What is my opininion on this game now? Its bad. That ""randomness"" I talked about in my old review, IS NO LONGER THERE.The game is so bugged and glitched and expanded, that it lost it's charm.Everything that can be done can be done in under 1 hour.All the fun in this game will run out in under one hour.You'll get bored in under 10 minutes.Everything has been done by stupid youtubers and ""remakes"" of the game in minecraft.R.I.P. ""Who's Your Daddy"", you were ""good"" for a while. Now you may be set to rest, and be free, of all the dumb people who don't know how to play the game, and just quit, making the game empty, and your servers empty.R.I.P., ""Who's Your Daddy"", you may be remembered, not always, but remembered.Well, always remembered, because it will stay in my library glowing white as ""downloaded""."

As the dad your job is to cover up all of the outlets, put all of the hamers, forks, batteries, bleach, and soap out of the baby's reach, don't get shot by the baby with a stun gun, not let the baby eat glass, drown, freeze or cook it's self, and don't let it drop a plugged in toaster into a toilet. As the baby you need to kill yourself in any way you can.Pros: Being baby is easylots of ways to diefuncreative deathsCons: Being dad is hardevery one wants to be the babyhard to find a good serverI would say that this game is 7.5/10 (Good, but not the best)would be 8.5 if I found it more easy to get a good server (So it's not the dev's fault)"
,Recommended,427730,21808927,"Posted: 13 March, 2016",all,chocoturkey,"-Overall Review-Who's Your Daddy is an interactive game about a father attempting to prevent his baby from certain death. Although the description of the game seems bland, Who's Your Daddy is a very fun and addictive game with depth added into its every design. This game is one of the few games that have lots of potential, and Who's Your Daddy takes advantage of that from doing everything possible to show its true form, a well-rounded, polished, fun game. From the many different items that are used both for the baby and daddy and the realistic house, it all adds into the feeling of saving your baby or dying a horrible death. I personally enjoyed tricking my daddy by closing doors to make it look like I wasn't in the room and then grabbing a hammer, rushed to the glass table in the TV room and smashed the glass and roll in it, gloating in my glory. You can be stuck for hours in this game without realizing how much time has passed because of the little details and Easter eggs that are hidden in the game. Figuring out how to eat batteries and Clorox Bleach is just scraping the surface. From vents in the house to finding car keys to hiding in a cabinet, Who's Your Daddy distances itself from other games because of the detail to every single thing possible to see and still maintaining the fair price and continuous weekly updates that make the game better. However, all games aren't perfect. Glitches forcing you to restart the game and minor setbacks here and there are always looming above you, however Who's Your Daddy somehow distracts the player from these imperfections by giving engulfing you in every game of 1 versus 1, making you want to play more, thus creating the best experience possible. If you aren't sure about getting this game, get it now! You won't regret it.--Pros--Easter eggs and small details continue to pull you into the game.Whether you are the baby or daddy, the suspense of saving the baby or hiding from the daddy is always around the corner.Early Access continues to bring new and improved features into an already great game.--Cons--Often times you find yourself waiting for minutes at a time for someone to join or someone to join you.The ""servers"" are not fully functional and may glitch at times.Frustration is always there when the biggest glitch of all occurs: You and someone else start a game, and the timer does not start, forcing you to exit and restart the game.---Verdict---Overall despite some minor setbacks and glitches, Who's Your Daddy provides players with a plethora of items to toy around with, and the exciting baby versus daddy episodes are sure to last.----Rating Chart----1) Don't buy this game2) Not Recommended3) Recommended4) Highly Recommended5) Definitely get this game -- VERDICT --"

And I hope to see more things to do in the future. (If that ever happens) BUT, the map is somewhat small, once you have it down as the Dad, you win everytime.1. lock cabinets2. take stool away from bathtub3. lock stove4. get cleaning fluids out of closetand basically thats it, I might have forgot one thing.And as the baby... simple,1. jump out of crib2. go through vent in hallway3. open door in floating cabinet4. eat all of the batteries5. grab the knife/fork and stick it in the electrical outletSimply put. You will run laps around anyone.And there is actually a decent amount of people who play the game, usually about 300, but you can join a server when they open, but you have to press quicklyAll in all, you should buy this game if you like to have fun."

The father has a high difficulty (to show how difficult is to be a father?). But if you play smart as a father, then you should win. The large amount of bugs that the game has and the lack of animations makes it even more fun (although there are some bugs that ruin some maches).The online works well.IF YOU PLAY WITH A FRIEND, I CAN ASSURE YOU, YOU WILL NOT GET BORED. (the game was worth every cent).Note to the developer (although, I doubt they update this game): If the father was given more time while the baby is asleep, that would balance more the game. And please fix the bug of the frame's on the walls of the staircase (that does not make the game more fun)."

I was a virgin as well. I had only kissed a couple girls, not much other than that to be honest. My best friend, Liam, always got women. He always told me that talking to girls was easy and not scary at all, just don't be a scared little dog and do it. I always wished I had his confidence. I asked for help to get a girlfriend/someone to ♥♥♥♥ so I wouldn't be a virgin finally. He said he'd help me, I was so damn happy and scared at the same time.So one day he decided to take me to a party he was going to. He was content on getting me laid finally. I was nervous asf. I had a few drinks and I saw a girl I thought was a solid 8/10. A little feral though. Liam saw me looking at her and laughed. I asked him what was funny and instead he pushed me into the same girl. I apologised and was freaking out. Liam came over and said ""This here is my boy, he acts shy but he's a ♥♥♥♥ing god. Treat him right."" and took off elsewhere. The girl giggled and told me her name was Olivia. Even thought my autism kicked in and I was a complete idiot we hit it off. A guy she knew came over and told her to come have a smoke with him. She said yes as he grabbed her hand and started walking off. She asked me if I smoked, I have never but I said yes anyway cause I wasn't letting this dog take her away from me. I inhaled my first cigarette and naturally I had a coughing fit. They laughed but it was all good. 1 year after that party I was dating Olivia. She took my virginity and we hit it off. I started smoking more often because why not, life was good. I loved her more than I will anything.At least it was until Olivia dumped me.Olivia cheated on me with Liam. Multiple times. The love of my life and my best mate.I became immensly depressed and started chain smoking. At least a pack a day. I did this for a solid 7 months. One day I started to feel a pain whenever I took a deep breath. I ♥♥♥♥ed myself.I went to to doctor's to find out what was happening. I was so damn worried. My doctor said they'd call me with results after a short time.After a week my doctor called me up with some results. I was freaking the ♥♥♥♥ out at this point. He said I was all clear and lucky because my cells defended my body before cancer could take affect. I cried for 3 days out of relief.I beat cancer.Just for Who's Your Daddy to give it back to me."

It runs like crap. And you can't even get a baby spot anymore unless you wait for about I don't know 2 hours. :\ I always end up being the Daddy, and even then it's the hardest job. You can't play normally and expect to have a good time unless your settings are turned down and your the baby.And now ya'll have made it run even worse than it was adding more music to it. Why don't you guys fix the actual problems like the smoothness of the game instead just adding music that is even more annoying than before?Although it is early acess, yes, I know, it's bound to have bugs, but the bugs for this game are too much. I mean, ARK Survival did a pretty good job at finding most of the bugs and fixing them right away. But this-. I get it, as I said, it's early acess, but you didn't even try to fix bugs or make it run smoother. You just added a backyard and music. That doesn't go well if you ask me.

Do I reccomend this game?Honestly, yes.Well, first of all it's a $5.00 game, and it's not finished yet, so sure it may have bad graphics (although I like them) and sure there are some stuff wrong with it, but for $5 and knowing the fact its going to be updated and probably fixed, this game is pretty cool.You play as the dad or the baby. The baby's job is to kill itself in many different ways around the house. There are going to be different gamemodes so that's not necessarily all you have to do.The dads job is to stop the baby from killing itself until 4 PM when the mom gets home.There is many different ways in which you could kill yourself as a baby! Some are easy and require one step. (i.e drinking bleach, eating soap bar, etc.) and some require a couple of steps. (Grab a hammer, break the table/windows and eat the glass, grab a fork or a knife and put it in the outlet, etc)Another thing I like about this is....the fact that you can stab your dad, use a laser to make him blind and tazer him. 10/10But seriously, I do recommend this game if you like goat simulator or just plain fun and funny multiplayer games!"

The main game mode is way too hard when you're the daddy since the house is so large. You're baby proofing the kitchen when the baby is trying to drive the car, when the baby is drowning in the pool, etc. It's very hard to win unless the baby let's you win. The other game modes to me are very boring to me other than the family gathering mode but that mode doesn't work because the matchmaking never works for me. Once everyone joins and the game starts, around 90% of the people in the game leave for no reason if anyone joins at all. The game is fun for the first few hours but once you get later in the game, there is basically nothing new to do. Once you discover that the game doesn't have any more stuff to do, it's already too late to refund it. If you want to get this game then get it on sale. It's not worth $5."

The animation could be a little better, I noticed that when 'daddy' crouches he just snaps at the waist and instantly becomes half his height but that does not overly bug me.The game play is good, one on one who can do what the fastest. Baby eats a battery, Daddy feeds a pill to Baby. Baby sits in oven, Daddy turns off oven and turns on the lock. Baby takes knife and heads to the power socket, Daddy ether takes all knives away or puts socket protectors in them. It is rather comical, I played as both and found that good fun can be had with next to no hastle.The learning curve is nothing daunting, as Baby your 'job' is to be a hazard, you need to drink poison *soap, window cleaner, bleach* you need to eat bad things *raw meat, batteries, trash* you need to get into bad places *in the bath, in the oven* you need to put things in sockets *Knife or fork* and lastly you have the hammer to break the glass. As Daddy you not only have to keep Baby safe from that by detoxing Baby with Pills but you also have to stop it from happening again by locking cabinets, placing dangerous things up out of reach, putting in socket protectors etc. Finally there is a reward, if you put all of Baby's toys away you gain ESP and can see Baby's health and location through walls, I never earnt this but it is infinitly useful.The price is completely worth it, I certainly feel that when I bought this game I have managed to get a game that can be played over and over without getting dull.Finally, would I ask my friends to get this game? Yes, yes I would."

In this game you either play as a Baby or a Daddy, the Baby's goal is to find one of the many ways to execute himself, and the Daddy's goal is to stop the baby from reaching that goal, each player has around 4 mins until the game ends and the daddy wins.Now this is really cool, but there's only one problem, the baby has more ways to execute himself, then the dad has to stop the baby, one of the most cheap ways to kill yourself, is to drive the car into the house. One fun thing about this game is the chore system, everytime you complete a chore like putting the clothes away or washing the baby it will give the daddy a buff.

We would either:1)  Both control the Dad.or2) Characters separately controlled, but the camera for the baby spins around uncontrollably.Unfortunately, this made the game completely unplayable.If anyone knows a fix for this, PLEASE let me know!!!!!!!!

Also the Dad needs buffs, Theres so many ways the baby can die so while the dad is running wild around the house trying to babyproof stuff, the babys already drowning in the pool.

I can't say anything about the gameplay because we didn't manage to get far at all (or even anywhere). The controls are incredibly buggy and the keybindings are frustrating and unworkable. For some reason, on the controller, some actions are tied to the same button by default (in my case both ""forward"" and ""backward"" were tied to the same key so moving was impossible). Trying to change them didn't help. Each time I tried to select a different key, the game would set it to ""5"" no matter what I pressed. This happened with the keyboard bindings too, not just the controller.Also -- when they say ""partial"" controller support, they mean it, and it's extremely limited. The game doesn't seem to recognize joystick movements or even the arrow keys on PS4 controllers -- literally only the triggers and some (4) of the physical buttons work. You'll still need to rely heavily on the keyboard to move or look around, which is just added inconvenience and pretty much defeats the whole point of trying to set up a controller in the first place.Save yourself the $5 and 20 minutes it cost me trying to get this game to work.

Although it is a fun(ish) game, it still need A LOT of work. Playing as baby at times can be way too overpowered since there are SO many ways to kill yourself and how frequently the methods are placed. Unfortunatly, when playing as daddy, you have little information to begin with, and you have fewer ways to keep baby from killing its self. Because of this, playing daddy takes way more skill and knowledge than playing baby. There are also some instances where baby gets stuck on props around the map too, which also gets quite annoying at times.~PROS~-new concept-unusual gameplay~CONS~-loses luster quickly-unbalanced roles-overpriced-parts of map are brokenOverall, this game tried really hard to be different than all the others, but honestly, it needs some serious polish. This game is also seriously overpriced, worth about 99 cents. You can get like two donuts and a cup a coffee for like $5 and it would be more satisfying than playing this game."

It is very fun, can provide quite a few hearty laughs, and even can prove to be a bit of a challange, as the game is, even admitted by the developer, asymetric favoring the baby. The gameplay quickly turns father players into either bumbling panicked messes trying to baby proof anything and everything as fast as possible, or a cool and collected father, going from drawer to shelf, covering power outlets and locking cabinets. Meanwhile, baby players turn into death machines, trying to find every way possible to get an edge up on their dads, drinking bleach, using their blocks to reach high places, etc. etc.While I do rather reccomend Who's Your Daddy, this reccomendation comes with a bit of a disclaimer. The fun and laughs this games offers wear off rather fast, at least in its current state. Some of the most deadly items to the baby spawn in the same location every game, while all the items useful to the father are completely randomized, and the time it takes trying to search through all the drawers and cabinets to find them, is just time that the baby is given to find one of its, rather easy, deaths. Objects like knives and forks are a dime a dozen, and it makes it very easy for the baby to overwhelm the father and get an easy, yet entertaining, death by electric shock.Overall, for its (current) $5 price tag, Who's Your Daddy is a fun little package filled with good laughs and somewhat addicting gameplay. The game is still in Early Access, and still has room and time to improve on its formula, but until then, be aware that the $5 you're spending are going to yield abour 2-5 hours of fun gameplay, before it starts becoming a bit stale and unfun. I hope to see the game improve, and I can see potential, but at it's current stage, it's only good for a short laugh, before the game becomes a bit boring. Buy at your own risk."

I had seen a few YouTubers playing it, and I thought it would be fun.In all honesty, it's not that bad of a game. The idea is good, there are plenty of gruesome ways to die, and the graphics are decent. But there are a few issues, some that might be out of the developer's control, but issues notheless.1. It's imbalanced. It's much, much easier to kill yourself as a baby than keep a baby from dying as a Daddy. You can't even pick the kid up or pull things out of their hands without dropping the item you had first, which is far too buggy and difficult to do. Can you even do that? Daddy is an adult, he should be able to at least decently protect a small child.2. Nobody plays this game. Nobody. The servers are almost completely empty. And as a person without a lot of online friends plus a busy home/school life, my only option is the vacant servers. The solution to this might be a singleplayer mode, in which you battle against an AI. Or maybe just address the first issue, and this one might just fix itself.Overall rating: 5.5/10. Has the potential to be something worth buying/playing, but needs some more work."

I'm playing on controllers split screen which is just horrible in both functionality and cross interference (random movement). As of today the baby wins and then the baby flies around until the dad wins, WTF? As the dad you have no other option than to watch the baby grab things and murder themselves with no recourse other than blocking things. If there is an option to remove items from the babies hand I haven’t found it, or at least it’s not available on the 360 controller. It seems that more thought was put in for these hats than actual game functionality and intuitive play. The most annoying thing is the interact dot….it’s white…everything is bright and you have to be too exact for the controller to walk up and grab things. I was hoping to play a game with the kids but this is just lousy, I’m convinced they only play because they saw it on YouTube, otherwise they would get frustrated. Save your five bucks and skip this one until they work on it more."

Though the biggest problem I have with this game, if any, is that nobody plays as the dad because they all suck at that class, forcing you to play as dad or wait an hour for the game to hook you up with a dad. And if you're GOOD at the dad class, all the babies quit because they only play for the sake of winning. Still a great game though. Also, fps is a bit low unless you turn off the fancy shaders, but thats just a minor problem."

,Recommended,427730,19911324,"Posted: 24 December, 2015",all,RypeLemon,"In it's current state, Who's Your Daddy is a little too unbalanced to be as fun as it's capable of being. I definitely think that the role of the father should be a little bit harder than the baby, but as it stands the player controlling the father simply doesn't have enough time to child proof much of anything before the player controlling the baby bee-lines to the batteries and fork in the kitchen and then kills themself almost right away with one electrical outlet or another. I had seen another review suggesting 30 seconds to a minute for the father to baby-proof the house, but I'm not sure I entirely agree (although I think it's absolutely a reasonable suggestion) because during that time the baby would be forced to just sit idly. I think the answer to the imbalance may be in some randomized elements. Instead of all outlets being uncovered, maybe a few random ones could be covered at the beginning of the match. Additionally, I'd really like to see randomized item location and less of them in general, because as I had mentioned earlier the batteries and fork and bleach jug/cleaning supplies are all very close to each other and always in the same place. Other than the frustrating imbalance at the moment, I think this has the potential to be a unique, strategic, and incredibly enjoyable 1v1 game after a couple of tweaks.(Note: Although my total play time is low, I did play more of the alpha before it had been released to Steam)"

I hope this stays simple though, I think the simplicity is what makes it great.  I love the idea of being able to jump into multiplayer and be playing...seemingly anonymously in seconds.The pros:Great Concept, it's funny while keeping you focused and the action lively.Clean Graphics, makes it easy to identify what you're doing and where you're going.Good menu, easy to understand and easy to navigate.Small install size, doesn't seem to be a lot of bloat here, it was something like a 111MB download?The cons:strange physics glitches, it felt jittery and unstable - it was hard to reliably climb the stairs especially.there might have been some lag issues, it was hard to know what was a network hiccup or a physics issuethe in-game HUD is minimalist, which is nice, but it's so minimalist I'm wasn't sure what I was looking at most of the timethings to add?:more weird music, the current track is neither good nor bad, but if it's on a playlist with other weird songs I think it'd work well.bigger maps - the current map is small enough it's hard to hide away as the baby and get out of the father's view.multiplayer mode? - multiple babies, multiple dads something like this might be fun for team 'deathmatch' type playways for the baby to trip/temporarily disable the parentways for the parent to put the baby in the crib temporarilyOverall, a great start though, I'm really looking forward to seeing how silly this gets."

If you play as the Dad your objective is to make sure you put saety locks on all safety hazards around the house, sometimes you are required to pick up things with the E button, being the dad can be quite challenging with the baby running under your feet trying to get into stuff.

The feeling, indescribable. I have concluded that there is absolutely no better game than ""Who's Your Daddy"" in the whole of human history. I had bee searching for the best game for many years but could never find something deserving of that title; this was gifted to me by a friend. I put on my Fedora and combed my beard in anticipation as I booted up the game and when the title screen appeared I came buckets. The Graphics are real-life-tier and the story motives are better written than Shakespeare's Hamlet and Homer's Odyssey combined. The gameplay mirrors exactly what being a father is all about. I wept pure hot tears. This game made me abandon Atheism, for when I played it, I was convinced that there was a god. Pure Euphoria rushed through my veins as I drank bleach and stuck forks in electrical sockets. I quit my job, left my wife, and abandoned my kids to play this game non-stop. Even in the event that my house catches on fire or I collapse of a heart attack,  the cure for cancer is found, civilization collapses, Jesus returns to the earth, the eventual heat-death of the universe occurs, etc, nothing could convince me to stop playing this game.Every once in a while you get the chance to play a game that sets the bar for everything else. This game will forever be the one by which all others are measured. I've considered on several occasions cryogenically freezing myself, because absolutely nothing else in this modern world could possibly top the experience I had while playing what will come to be known as the ultimate masterpiece of human intelligence. I am 100% fully convinced that I can say with absolute certainty that this is the peak of everything in human history and that everything else you will ever do will only be a complete and utter disappointment in comparison."

This has nothing to do with the fact that im drunk, except I'll rate it at 1003940184/100 because I am.Pros:+ Very Exciting+ Randomly generated spawns of most items makes the game interesting.+ Playing with a friend over Skype is HILARIOUS+ If you're drunk it's even more fun+ Never the same game, Dad will try to thwart what you last did and you have to think of something else to kill yourselfCons:- Dad is hard AF (imo)- Game can freeze for both parties if there is a not-outstanding connection (but the game doesn't take long to load so it's worth it)- Dad is hard- Need's a baby suicide interaction with the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥- Needs more variety (it's Early Access, what is there to say?).Overall, 8/10 VERY WORTH IT ON SALE I 100% recommend this to anyone who loves playing random multiplayer, short-session laugh-fests with friends."

But really when you relise how messed up it is to try and kill yourself as a baby. It loses all the fun. Also when you figure out everyway to kill the baby then it is not fun. Also it is so easy to win as the baby. You only have to walk down stairs and drink the cleanering supplies and you kill yourself. Unless the dad is good and stops you before you can. Also most of the time the baby just drinks the cleaning supplies and hide then dies and wins. The dad doesn't even get a chance to stop the baby. Another thing is that it was really slow. I was hosting a game and even the person in the room next to mine in the same house had lag issues. So I would say if you are into killing yourself as a baby then wait for the full game.

I tried playing it with a couple of frriends of muine minuse 2, and It wasn't very enjoyable because I think I entered another demension when the dad picked me up as a baby. Like legit, I fell through the map and was slowly falling in a deep depression as I decended to my unfourtant loss of the round. Following the next round, I play as the Dad vs the babies. I would try to pick up the baby and put them back in the baby room, but they would just fall out of my fingers onto the cold, wooden, poorly textured, but also satisfying wooden boards. THis is possibly the worst game I have ever played (maybe not). TBH, I think the first version of this game (0.01) was better than this current version, (2.00). Honestly, just trying to remove this game from my memory part of my brain was the most difficult thing in myh life. I had to go through weeks of training my brain to get streonger and remove that little pickly from the bacvk ofmy brain. Like in the spongebob episode when he forgets a lot of things such as his name, his friends, his job, etc. Anyways, this game was pretty bad. So I would give it a good review...."

The dad seems to always have the biggest advantage when going 1 vs 1, struggling takes too long as a the baby and sometimes you'll glitch and twist your head while doing it....which makes it hard when you crawl. The baby has a very short span of ""sprint"" and takes a very long time for it to get back. The idea of the game is very well made but executed quite poorly. Even with that, the game is very fun with a few of your friends - if the devs patched up the glitches it'd be a 10/10 from me but so far I'd probably rate it a 6/10 -- still fun so I do recommend this game.

Then when you think you have him protected, WAITTTTTT WAIT A MINUTE, WHAT IS THIS, TRIANGLES ALL ABOUT TEH ROOM?! Illuminati confirmed. No, actually get the car key, CAR KEY IS THE ONE THING DADS CANNOT TAKE AWAY FROM THE BABY. remember dat now, the 2 last things to do is open the fridge door and follow the baby around with a pill, win? Thumbs up :). if not, then try doing it all faster and check the baby a little more.K GUYS, THE ULTIMATE WAY TO WIN AS BABY ISSSSSSSS......... Hamer, smash the table, get to the cups, knock them over, hide the baby floaty(get in pool), go to all places with bleach, fridge, The oven, the baby gun disably and then hurry and do something, and the foam ball gun, car, eat bleach then hide inside the room of achievement or the office(Trust me, its the last place they will look), eat paint, drown in the bathtub, and i think the last thing ISSSSSSSS, The shower. Hopefully i answered all the ways to die, but WAITTTTT, power outlet stabbing and toaster exploding.toilet drowning??But Sorry For Me Essay But lol so BALL IS LIFE and PLAY DIS GAME NOWWWW IF U DONT HAVE IT OR IF U do?

Could be improved with other gamemodes and more randomizations and more maps. In it's early stages and frequent updates this game has a lot of potential and is still worth it now. The only issue I've had so far is a small amount of lag, but for some reason only as the baby, not as bad on daddy mode. More graphic settings could help fix this problem, because even with everything off it still lags."

,Not Recommended,427730,22131892,"Posted: 29 March, 2016",all,Cis',"Harlequin-type ichthyosis is a very rare severe genetic disease, which causes thickening of the skin. At birth, the child’s whole body is encased in an 'armour' of thick white plates of skin, separated with deep cracks. In addition, the eyes, ears,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and limbs may be abnormally contracted. Because of resultant cracked skin in locations where normal skin would fold, it is easily pregnable by bacteria and other contaminants, which can result in serious risk of fatal infection.It is an autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis, which is a group of nonsyndromic disorders of keratinization. It is associated with a mutation in the gene for the protein ABCA12. The disease can be diagnosed in the uterus by way of fetal skin biopsy or by analysis of amniotic fluid cells obtained by amniocentesis. Common features of the disease can be recognized through ultrasound, and follow up with 3D ultrasound to diagnose the condition. Ultrasound can reveal abnormal facial features with ectropion, eclabium, short foot length, incurved toes, clenched fists, poor delineation of nostrils, and polyhydramnios.Constant care is required to moisturise and protect the skin. The overall rate of Harlequin ichthyosis is 1 in 300,000 births.The harlequin-type designation comes from the diamond shape of the scales at birth (resembling the costume of Arlecchino)Newborns with Harlequin-type ichthyosis present with thick, fissured armor-plate hyperkeratosis. Sufferers feature severe cranial and facial deformities. The ears may be very poorly developed or absent entirely, as may the nose. The eyelids may be everted (ectropion), which leaves the eyes and the area around them very susceptible to infection. Babies with this condition often bleed during birth. The lips are pulled back by the dry skin (eclabium). Joints are sometimes lacking in movement, and may be below the normal size. Hypoplasia is sometimes found in the fingers. Polydactyly has also been found on occasion. In addition, the fish mouth appearance, mouth breathing, and xerostomia place affected individuals at extremely high risk for developing rampant dental decay.Patients with this condition are extremely sensitive to changes in temperature due to their hard cracked skin, which prevents normal heat loss. Respiration is also restricted by the skin, which impedes the chest wall from expanding and drawing in enough air. This can lead to hypoventilation and respiratory failure. Patients are often dehydrated, as their plated skin is not well suited to retaining water.The diagnosis of Harlequin-type Ichthyosis relies on both physical examination and certain laboratory tests. Physical assessment at birth is vital for the initial diagnosis of Harlequin ichthyosis. Physical examination reveals characteristic symptoms of the condition especially the abnormalities in the skin surface of newborns. Abnormal findings in physical assessments usually result in employing other diagnostic tests to ascertain the diagnosis. Genetic testing is the most specific diagnostic test for harlequin ichthyosis. This test reveals a loss of function mutation on the ABCA12 gene. This gene is important in the regulation of protein synthesis for the development of the skin layer. Mutations in the gene may cause impaired transport of lipids in the skin layer and may also lead to shrunken versions of the proteins responsible for skin development. Less severe mutations result in a collodion membrane and congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma-like presentation. ABCA12 is an ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter, and is a member of a large family of proteins that hydrolyze ATP to transport cargo across membranes. ABCA12 is thought to be a lipid transporter in keratinocytes necessary for lipid transport into lamellar granules during the formation of the lipid barrier. Biopsy of skin may be done to assess the histologic characteristics of the cells. Histological findings usually reveal hyperkeratotic skin cells, which leads to a thick, white and hard skin layer.Constant care is required to moisturise and protect the skin. The hard outer layer eventually peels off, leaving the vulnerable inner layers of the dermis exposed. Early complications result from infection due to fissuring of the hyperkeratotic plates and respiratory distress due to physical restriction of chest wall expansion. Management includes supportive care and treatment of hyperkeratosis and skin barrier dysfunction. A humidified incubator is generally used. Intubation is often required until nares are patent. Nutritional support with tube feeds is essential until eclabium resolves and infants can begin nursing. Ophthalmology consultation is useful for the early management of ectropion, which is initially pronounced and resolves as scale is shed. Liberal application of petrolatum is needed multiple times a day. In addition, careful debridement of constrictive bands of hyperkeratosis should be performed to avoid digital ischemia. Cases of digital autoamputation or necrosis have been reported due to cutaneous constriction bands. Relaxation incisions have been used to prevent this morbid complication.In the past, the disorder was nearly always fatal, whether due to dehydration, infection (sepsis), restricted breathing due to the plating, or other related causes. The most common cause of death was systemic infection and sufferers rarely survived for more than a few days. However, improved neonatal intensive care and early treatment with oral retinoids, such as the drug Isotretinoin (Isotrex), may improve survival. Early oral retinoid therapy has been shown to soften scales and encourage desquamation. After as little as two weeks of daily oral isotretinoin, fissures in the skin can heal, and plate-like scales can nearly resolve. Improvement in the eclabium and ectropion can also be seen in a matter of weeks. Children who survive the neonatal period usually evolve to a less severe phenotype, resembling a severe congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma. Patients continue to suffer from temperature dysregulation and may have heat and cold intolerance. Patients can also have generalized poor hair growth, scarring alopecia, contractures of digits, arthralgias, failure to thrive, hypothyroidism, and short stature. Some patients develop a rheumatoid factor-positive polyarthritis. Survivors can also develop fish-like scales and retention of a waxy, yellowish material in seborrheic areas, with ear adhered to the scalp."

One could say babies capabilities to kill itself is OP. Sometimes it's true, sometimes not.Review: The game is 1v1, Online-only Dad Vs Suicidal Baby. Items randomly position themselves everytime in select locations that are meant for the dad, or for the baby. Things ranging from a Padlock for the dad to lock cupboards so the baby has harder time accessing poison and dangerous objects, but also things like the Baby Key which can unlock the cupboards if found and used. Other items may range from Fruit, or meat in the fridge which can heal the baby if 'wounded'.The point is to keep your baby alive obviously, or to die if you're the baby, it's fun whether with a stranger or with a friend.I make Let's Plays in my spare time and I've currently made 3 videos.

I really like DanTDM and with his comentary it made look like a awesome game. This game is powered by unity, which is a game engine for people who dont want to make a game from typing code. Because of this the game is really glitchy and really irritating to play. I've tried to open a door once and I flew out of the map because of a glitch. Also object like cups and bottles and other small objects are really glitchy when bumped or moved. Also because of alot of updates the game is almost impossible to win as the daddy. They added pets that poop and phase through walls, a pool which almost instantly kills you, and other things that make it extremely hard to win as the dad. Plus its split-screen is horrible. So basically you can only play it on the internet. Well basically hardly anyone is online, and went you do finally join a game after waiting for people they just leave mid-game. So basically you can never play a full game without everybody just leaving the second it starts. I seriously don't recommend this game and am trying to get a refund. I've seriously been disapointed in this game from seeing Youtubers overly hype this game and make it look a lot better than it is. Welp. Better look for another game...."

It's fun with a stranger, it's hysterical with someone you know.My only gripe is that the father's strategy feels very linear while the baby has great freedom and, consequentially, the father's role is much harder. Better balance and, obviously, more strategies for infant mortality would be awesome."

But, there are issues that I will list, as well as some suggestions to improve the game.There are definitely clipping issues, especially with the walls, as I have lost several matches due to the locks or the plug covers going through a wall.  Hopefully those will be fixed relatively soon.Lag issues.  From time to time, despite having a pretty high-end PC and 75mbps connection, I experiance catastrophic lag whenever I play in a room that I, myself, am not hosting.  I am unsure if this is a stability issue, or I have consistantly joined people with high latency.  It would be nice to see the latency of each person hosting games, in order to avoid the latter, hopefully the former is being looked in to.Some items do NOT spawn at all at times, or sometimes spawn behind drawers, where they are unreachable.  This makes winning as the father impossible in those situations.The one tune playing on the radio gets old, pretty quickly.  More variety in the music, possibly let people use their own music in it, would be good.The area, while containing a diverse range of stuff to hide from baby, is kinda small.  It would be nice if we had more rooms.  Maybe allow for different areas of the house for different playthroughs,  I would LOVE to see a laundry room, since the idea of the baby being able to go into a washer or dryer (or both) is hilarious.  Maybe even add an ironing board.  Trying to keep the baby from danger in a garage, or yard would be fun, too.Edit:  Seems most of those have been implemented.  Good joh, dev.  Only problem is that there seems to be a glitch in the garage that makes characters move sideways, almost as if I am walking against an invisible wall that is forcing me to strafe.  This is the only room that does that.While the one on one aspect is fun,  having only one game mode does get tedious.  It would be fun to have other game modes, maybe one where dad has to compete against twins, or mom AND dad, or two dads, have to go against a faster version of the baby.  Maybe a survival mode with different rooms in the house steadily unlocking, bringing even more dangers for dad to move out of reach for baby.Overall, I would recommend playing this game, especially with friends.  Though, I would suggest maybe waiting until it is further along in development, so more of the kinks are worked out."

Just running around and trying to hide (when you're the child) gives you such a rush. Sometimes whenever the game gets updated we'll just sit and use all of the new features I stead of play the game. We've found some pretty funny glitches that I hope make it into the final release version because they are just so much fun to do.

Now we are waiting for new updates including maps, ways of death, more charakters and much more! We had some ideas and I just wanted to write them down.1. The role of the dad is kind of hard. Maybe you could add another player like the mom or a second dad but that is up to you.2. It would be cool to have more ways of hiding. For example you could hide under a pillow or a blanket. You could decide if you wanted to be a sneaky suidical baby or not.3. Add secret places for the baby. Maybe there is a secret passage way behind a picture or you could actually go into the vents and make your own way throught the house behind the walls.4. Give the players more choices. Give the people who host the servers the choise on what time the mother will be home, the map, the ways of death (decide what is available in the house for the baby to kill itself) and much more.5. Add more ways of death. For example, the baby could die of fall damage, walking on the road (you could add a yard where the baby could go out to), burn alive in a fire place and much more.6. Give the dad more ways of stopping the child. Maybe he could block him, or pick him up till the baby shakes itself off, or call for help for a couple of seconds if you decide not to add another player.7. Give the game different modes. You could add for example a twin mode (two babies), a hide and seek mode (dad looks for one or more babies), a mom and dad mode (two parents look for the baby, again if you wont add another player), a travel mode (Could visit different countries or baby tries to kill itself in the bus, car, train, plain, etc...), a chaos mode (Many Players are allowed to join and have a chaotic match), or maybe even a story mode.8. Make the design a bit better and the physiks fun but a bit more realistic maybe.If any of the tips helped you to develop the game or find new ideas for it, please tell me somehow. I would be honoured! But at its current state it's still a realy fun game and I could just recommend it!(If you need more ideas then I would be more then happy to help you out, just try to get in contact with me! I will for sure find a lot more ideas which could improve or make the game even more fun!)"

,Recommended,427730,21627928,"Posted: 4 March, 2016",all,ZackofallTrades198,"I would like to begin my review by stating that I was inspired to review this game at all because the devs released a new patch. Honestly, when I first got this game, I knew that it was minimal on the features, and I anticipated that I would have to wait a long time for the game to attain any substance. Well, the devs took my five dollars and put it where their mouths are and proceeded to make an asskickingly fun game. The game itself is great with a simple concept, one which has circulated on the internet for a while, but the way that these guys have done it, and the creative ways in which the baby can kill itself, give this game a polished sheen. It is far from complete, but the developers have certainly impressed me with their community outreach, and I commend them for not just taking people's money, going dark for 2 months, then releasing a lackluster patch. They consistently add new content into the game, and the game's expanse is ever-growing. Devs, if you're reading this, keep up the good work; I really appreciate it. As to all you reading who aren't the devs, you should buy this game solely based on how active the team is. In the past 2 or 3 months, they've taken a game where the only ways to kill yourself was to put a fork in a socket, drink bleach, or drown, and turned it into a game where killing yourself is more of an artform than anything. If the basic description of this game caught your interest, then go ahead and buy it. It's only $5, and it may very well be the best $5 you've ever spent.TL;DR: Good game. Devs are active. Good game. Best game."

I know it's only $5, so it's not much of an investment but (for me) it's very laggy (not sure if that's my computer or the game) and it's just not too exciting. With a friend I'm talking to it's slightly more fun, but even then with the (very) small map and limited interactions I just can't say you should get it. If it gets better with more maps and more possibilities then I can easily reccomend it, but not right now."

In this game, it is almost required you have a friend to play with, because otherwise there's no interaction other than the baby jumping around as you slowly advance as the Dad, desperately trying to feed it a pill, tears rolling down your face as the baby grins in delight as its little body gives in to the Bleach, Soap, Trash, Dishwashing fluid and foam balls it has gorged upon.This game is fun, and very cheap, but without a friend or a system being implemented to be able to partake in banter with your opponents then the game shall remain a short lived experience, albeit a funny one."

So far the game is a 5/10, when more updates come with more aspects to improve gameplay and game functionality, then it can go further than just a 5.

The number of ways the baby can now kill themselves is not only terrifying, but also terrifying. Yes, I know I said it twice. The dad on his own simply does not have the ability to stop a baby that is actually trying to commit seppuku. Unless  you practice or try hard (which let's be honest here, isn't gonna happen with this game), or have an innate talent for this game (in which case I grieve for you), get used to only winning as the baby. If this issue was fixed, then I'd change my review, but for now I simply can't recommend this game."

You really cant get any game as dramatic and funny as this game can be. Play with friends is such a great feture. You can switch roles, or play the same. Super fun!

The mechanics are very easy, with things being mostly point, click, and move.Pros:>Good features>Good mechanics>Good graphics>Very simpleCons:>Bugs are very bad>Notifying system is very hard to pay attention to and know about (in-game and out)>Designs are too bland>Updates never seem to fix the bugs that are extremeOverall, the game is hilarious!

The game is a lot of fun and its really cheap I expected this game to be at least 15 dollars, because it is a great game. The game is only five dollars and its soooo much fun!What I want...-The Game is kinda laggy and my friend bought it because I told him to and he cant play it and he constantly annoys me about that.-Diffrent Maps,I think diffrent maps would make a huge diffrence in this game. Theres alot of things the baby can kill himself with now so... Some of that stuff should be on diffrent maps. Also it would be nice to explore the difrrent maps and find where things spawn again rather that it always being the sameFinal Thoughts----------------I recommend this its only 5$ anyway, Dispite all I said about the bad parts of this game theres alot more Good things."

So here's your chance and now you can go kill yourself.On a more serious note, the controls can be somewhat tricky like picking up things as being the dad. Especially when there's a lot of small items that need to be taken care of quickly (e.g. batteries).  Hopefully this can be more optimized.But other than that it's a great game to play for a little while with friends and alcohol - especially for the price range of ~ $5.Perhaps a best of 5 game option might also be cool in the future + round switch.tl;dr -> get your dad skills under control or baby wins."

At first glance it looks a little shallow but once you figure out some of the mechanics it's actually pretty deep. Lot of strategy.Totally recommend. At this point there is a lot to improve on but the game was super entertaining for the first hour.Tips for first timers:- The fruit heals the baby but once the heal runs out damage over time continues- Look for the pills (green bottles), they will stop damage over time but won't heal- Be mindful of all utensils as baby can get electrocuted- baby can use the vent system- hammer can break glass table so be waryOverall I found being the dad much much harder but I think there is a higher learning curve. After about 45 mins me and my friend figured out different strategies for each so the dad was winning a bit more."

Mouse is a logitech G500s and has no issues in any other game I play.As I mentioned at the start, it is a fun silly game, and it is great to play with mates over a few drinks and have a laugh, I like the game modes, but it really needs some map variation.Edit:Mouse problem has now gone away.

Bugs, bugs, and more bugs that will never be fixed because of the push for new content to keep people buying. PLEASE DON'T BUY IT! I'M BEGGING YOU!In Depth: It is straight up sad how this game is. I saw people on youtube play it... they always seemed to have so much fun playing, that it made me want to buy it. When it finally went on sale and I had some extra cash in my wallet, I purchased it. I was immediately dissapointed to find out that 1. there was no single player. 2. the multiplayer was slow and unreliable. The developers only add new content, paying little to no attention to the constant bugs, making the game practically unplayable unless you have an exceptionally strong computer. Even so, it is still difficult to get past the lag. In multiplayer, the game tends to crash, resulting in the other person quitting, which makes you go back to finding a partner to play with. This has literally taken me 10 minutes once. Imagine waiting all that time just for the game to crash. Also, refunds for the most part are not given out for this game, even with a proper reason. Don't take your chances. Let me remind you that the game is supposed to be FINISHED. It's supposed to be released. This means that bugs are fixed and people are happy. But no. Things are still being added and bugs are still not being removed. That doesn't sound like a completed game to me. But hey, lets say you don't care. Fine. Even still, the updates are about once maybe every four months. And the updates are not even good, they just add more lag. I fully understand that coding and such is difficult, but bug fixing needs to be a priority, not adding new content that doesn't work.I think it's downright depressing that this amazing concept for a game is ruined by the developers who care more about money and luring people in than the quality of their game. But hey, that's just business. I will never reccomend this game to anyone. Please, don't buy it. Please."

That's what I'm doing, or am forced to do.It doesn't help that I was planning to buy this game for a friend too, but we'll have to wait who knows how long to play together without lag storms and 1fps and all that.Hope bugs are fixed soon, you're ruining your reputation guys!This is a brilliant game and I'm still In love with the concept, it's hilarious!You just rushed it a bit."

Being created for the Unity Game Engine, it does have more than its fair share of glitches. There are seemingly more ways for the Baby to kill themselves than there are for the Daddy to stop them, and ultimately once you have more than 2 players, the odds are increasingly more skewed toward the Babies. All of this in consideration, there is a lot of potential. The game truly is addicting at times, and is good for those moments where you have the urge to kick a baby down a set of stairs. In this game, stress becomes a motivator for the Babies, and a necessity for the Daddy. You can say that the game is a decent stress reliever and definite source of laughs."

Basically if you're the baby you try to die and if you're the dad you try to save him.The game ends when Mom comes home (at 4). Dad wins if the baby doesn't die. The Baby wins if he kills himself.BAD things about this game: (not too bad )-Sometimes when you pick up the baby he gets stuck in your hands for the rest of the game (he should be able to escape)-Sometimes you aren't able to pick up the baby at all-Sometimes when you jump on poop you jump really high and get stuck-When dad goes in the blue car in the garage he gets stuck 90% of the time9/10

,Recommended,427730,33362679,Posted: 7 July,all,Mingsonto,"I will start this off with how this game is stupid silly fun. I have enjoyed playing it with friends and is a great thing to play occasionally when you are bored of other games. However, there are multiple things that must be made clear:1. It is only fun to play with people that you know and are in a call with since you can do some silly things and being in a call amplifies how entertaining some of the bugs and glitches2. It is fun for the price, you won't really get hours of gameplay simply because there is little to explore with the lacking of depth of gameplay. But this is being fixed since the developer has added a ton of features since i first got this game.Pros:-Fun to mess around with friends-Isn't demanding on your pc-Not very serious and fun to relax while playing-Buggy (adds for hilarious things)Cons:-Buggy (can be game breaking at some points)-No depth to the gameplay-Kinda need friends to play with otherwise it is boringI will give this a recommendation simply because it is fun and is not overpriced like a lot of the other games that are on steam.This games story makes you feel in control, even though you really aren't. But, the character development in this short of a story is amazing since at the end I honestly felt what the characters were feeling (not stating specifics as to not ruin the story). I would love to see another game similar to this due to its simple, fun, and short gameplay.Specs:Monitor: Acer 29” Ultrawide 2560x1080 @76hz (overclocked originally 60hz)Graphics Card: Gigabyte GTX 970CPU: i7 6700kMotherboard: Z170X - Gaming 5Hard Drives: Samsung SSD 850 EVO [250 GB], WD Blue [1 TB], WD Blue [2 TB]Keyboard: Corsair K70 RGB Cherry MX BrownsMouse: Corsair m65 RGBPower Supply: Corsair 750w"

You either are a Baby trying to kill yourself or your a Daddy trying to prevent the Baby's death. There can be like 5 Daddy's in one server which is hilarious. The game does get boring after a while. If your in for some real laughs with friends then you should definitely try this game out!

Or her fault. I have no idea what gender a pc has)-The baby can sometimes crawl through a door while it is closedAs you can see the Cons are only bugs/glitches. If they fix those, I don't have any Cons.Overall an enjoyable game, I bought it for myself and my friend.
