I involuntarily cried out several times, tried to back away in horror at least twice, mumbled to myself incoherently while trying to figure out the mystery, and generally felt like I did when I was a too-young boy of 13 who snunk into the theater to watch A Nightmare on Elm Street... it was an incredible experience!The story is engaging, the environments are beautiful, the suspense and fear feels genuine, with only a few of the cheap (but well-placed and effective) ""jump out of the shadows"" type startling moments.  In short, I loved this game.  I'd never heard of Wolf & Wood before this, but I'm already looking forward to whatever they offer next!As others have mentioned, the controls can be a bit frustrating, and I did have to reload a couple of levels when key items fell through the map or magically shot off into space, but these are minor issues - distractions, really - and should not dissuade you from purchasing this otherwise amazing game.This is VR.  This is real."
,Not Recommended,427760,22200450,"Posted: 2 April, 2016",all,Frodofeet,"I don't recommend this game to excited new Vive owners in its launch state.It plays as if it were in alpha, as most of the games I've been playing in Vive are in beta and are far more solid.It suffers from many technical glitches, objects get stuck together, fall through the world, don't move like a real world counterpart, and many times just don't make sense.My instinct to slide a cup resulted in the cup not moving, but sticking to the table.Using a lamp I found in a pitch black area didn't light the area at all, just the interactive object in it.The object interaction is very unintuitive, trying to pass objects from one hand to another results in them falling to the ground. Picking up the ""chair"" results in a strange feeling of it hanging by a string. All larger objects behave that way as I remember. Your hands in game float about 4 inches above where your real world hands are.The scripting is awkward and transparent. I decided not to take the pills in ep.1 and everything begins all over again without context.The point being that in order to be scared, you have to be drawn into the place, and all of these things constantly serve as distractions that break the immersion. It's like trying to watch a scary movie with the boom mic and set crew ending up in the camera view.Aside from that, I only made it to the second chapter and quit of frustration, while not being at all scary to me.I can't say whether it would be worth $25, because lost interest before completing it."

If yours is too small, you are allowed teleportation, but I did not try that, and if you have no room, get a bigger apartment. It's truly, certifiably, immersively scary. All the environments look great, it renders well. Of all the VR horror games, it surly is the most frightening, and suspenseful, and I am an advanced level 10 journeyman in Virtual Reality,  so I should know.I will never forget the sound it makes after a jumpscare scene...It starts off a little slow, with the first two chapters, and maybe some confusion in the hub level (you have to move the origami to a place on the board). I seem to remember being butt hurt and regretting my purchase, but before long, I was taken. I was only able to play around 1-2 chapters per night before it was done, and that was a fun week. I didn't really pay attention to the story (something about a little boy), but I will next time. I only took a few trips to the websites to get a hint, and overall the puzzle-age is fine.25$ is a perfect price for this, and it is worth ever damn shekel. They added a bonus episode, too! Woo! That was like, last year. God damnit, it's been so long since I've played this game. I'm trying to forget about it so I can play it fresh, but I fear everything will come back to me. I usually love to anti-socially spoil things for people, but in this instance, it might be wrong.Except for the epilogue, when you go mess with the coffee machine, then you turn around, BOOM!

I'm a big horror fan and I knew with VR, these kinds of games would be great for it if done right. Well, I'm happy to say that this is one of the best out there so far for the Vive!Pros - Great atmosphere and music. This is something a horror/suspense game needs and this one pulls it off! As for the scares, from what I played so far it does the job. I've been playing horror games for years now and never got scared or felt uneasy. This game made me jump and creeped me out. Great job! For the hell of it, I wanted to see how good of a job it does to make you feel like you're there in the world. I was very impressed with even the little things. When I was on a boat, I shifted my weight from one foot to the other, rocking back and forth. The boat actually moved like it would in real life. Bravo for the small details!Cons - So far the only thing I can complain about is the object interaction. Holding items feels weird unless you go out of your way to manipulate them until they fit in your hand how they are supposed to be. Then you have items that fall into walls or floors. If that happens with a key item, you have to restart the chapter. The other thing is room scale. It tells you that you have to have a certain amount of space, which I'm sure is true. It warned me my room wasn't big enough, but I continued anyways since it was just slightly off from the recommened space. It still worked well!With the small cons this game has, you must play this! This is the right direction for VR horror and I hope to see more from this developer and others."

Each room conforms to the size of your playspace so the entire game is played by walking around without any teleporting which makes it one of the more immersive experiences in VR (if you have enough space).The gameplay is ""escape the room"" across multiple rooms.

As people said before it's a bit of thriller/horror feel to it. It's got a bit weak/slow in the 'eraly mid game' when it was building a narrative after the hospital, but grew a bit stronger again towards the end. I recorded the entire game and ended up with 2.5 hours of gameplay. Might not sound like a lot but it's plently especially in VR. Especially now when 3 others has experinced it through the headset.Puzzles could be a little cryptic at time but not at all unmanageable. If someone new to gaming play this they might need a little backseat gaming, but dont give it to them straight of the bat."

You will actually feel like you're in a cramped, dark room with no way to escape. I feel like this is the current benchmark for VR horror games.Many people (perhaps rightly) complain that most of today's VR games are too short and unfinished to be worth their price tags, but A Chair In A Room isn't one of them. It's short--it took roughly three hours for me to get through it, but it feels complete. In fact, if it were any longer, it would have started to feel as if were dragging on.It's not perfect, though. The most noticeable problem is with object manipulation. Sometimes you'll spend a couple of minutes just trying to pick up an object. The physics can get weird at times, and collision detection seems to be a bit buggy. The narrative feels a bit strained as well. Honestly, I still don't get it.But even with these issues, it's still worth picking up."

Sure there are a few jump scares, but that's not what the game relies on. What it DOES rely on (and what it does so well) is giving the player a prolonged sense of fear. You'll spend the majority of this game looking over your shoulder, feeling like you're being watched as you explore your surroundings, piecing together the missing fragments of your memories.Downsides: The item manipulation can be a little finicky occasionally hen it comes to complex tasks (I had trouble with the crowbar) but it didn't draw me out of the experience. At other times it can be absolutely spot on (eg. I was hit by a jump scare and instinctively reached offscreen for my lamp, grabbed it first time and swung it around to see what spooked me. Didn't even realise until I was watching my recording later on)Upsides: Everything else."

,Recommended,427760,24641661,"Posted: 31 July, 2016",all,Basilisk,"REASONS TO BUY:* If you're looking for an atmospheric horror game that makes you solve obscure puzzles while slowly creeping under your skin. (Partially correct, see my edit att the bottom!)* It has more variety than most other early VR titles... combined. That says more about other VR titles than this, though.* It's very immersive if you have the space for full VR room scale.REASONS TO AVOID:* If you have small space. I have 2.5x2.9 square meters and it's working great, but much smaller would probably not.* If you are impatient and don't like obscure far-fetched puzzles. This game has them. They are far fetched. Sometimes you just end up trying everything with everything. I'm a pretty clever dude and I almost gave up early on.* If money matters to you. As an indie title with low quality assets, it's really worth maybe 10 euros, not 20+. It's overpriced because it's VR, and VR makes everything look shiny.Minor annoyances that don't really matter:* Game physics could be better. Objects behave like they have no mass.* Loading screens could be smoother. Sometimes your ""hands"" disappear and you see default controllers while loading.-- Edit: August 7, 2016. After playing some more, I have this to add:Avoid this if you don't handle jump scares well and want to finish the game. At a certain point in the narrative the atmospheric sense of dread and tension becomes a predictable jump scare formula. To me, the whole point with fear in a game is that you can overcome it, force yourself to move forward. But that point is lost if you're certain that there's an unavoidable jump scare ahead. The game makes you look really hard at something and, predictably, startles you with a loud noise and something ugly out of nowhere right in your face. In VR it's not ""fun scary"", it's just painful and pointless and punishing.In my opinion, as an early VR horror game experiment, it's a failure. It doesn't matter how polished parts of a game are if it ultimately fails to make me want to play it until the end. But I still recommend trying this game because it's an honest effort and some people maybe enjoy being punished for overcoming fear."

This is the first to come along for me and with this quality title so soon in the lifecycle of VR I CANNOT WAIT to see what is in store for the future.The sound, environments, story, and perfect placement of things that simply either creep you out, unsettle you, or straight up make you scream is superb.  It does not beat you over the head with constant thing jumping in your face or anything like that.

VR makes such a massive difference in this genre. There've been a couple times I actually had to close the game out, take a breather, and try again in a little while.There are a couple jump scares here and there, but the game primarily relies on psychological horror and storytelling, both of which it does a fantastic job of. I find myself hesitating at every door and having to force myself to turn toward noises in a dark room. I can't get over how immersive this is.I'm playing in a smaller space, so I'm using the locomotion beta, which works very well. However, for the full experience, I'm sure that having a room that meets the minimum requirements without teleportation would be even better.The only downsides I have so far are bugs. The physics engine is pretty bad; when things work, they work believably, but when they don't, they REALLY don't. It's enough to take you out of it for a minute or two at times.

Now I'm only 1.7 hours into it. But even in that short time I have realised this should of been one of the 1st games I bought for the vive.What I like the most is the use of roomscale and the game having a story. The puzzles while not being super obvious are good and I've had to check the clue option a few times.I have not being scared as of yet being only upto chapter 3. But the atmosphere has my skin crawling and that cold grasp on the back of my neck a few times.Only complaints is it took me a few times to realise the options and load games was on posters in the first room. I had started from beginning a few times before that.The game runs smooth on my R9 390x with a i5 6600k both OC'ed. I will update review when I'm all the way through the game.Reasons for buying: It's not another zombie wave shooter. It has a story and it's spooky and bound to get damn right scary before I finish.If you have a vive and want something a little better than most of the vive titles. Than I recommend this game.
,Recommended,427760,24513162,"Posted: 24 July, 2016",all,sayre85,"I just finished the game this evening, after finally deciding to tackle it through a couple hour-long play sessions.I can't stress enough how under-appreciated and under-represented Chair in a Room is on Steam and in HTC's own marketing for the Vive. I know it's become kind of in vogue to claim that a VR game isn't getting enough love, but this is one title that REALLY (in my opinion) needs to be in everyone's Steam library.While playing, I couldn't get over the persistent feeling that the game felt like it was breaking first ground for what room-scale horror is going to look like in the next five or ten years. ""I'll bet this is what people thought of Alone in the Dark,"" I thought to myself. And really, the comparison doesn't stop at the positives. AitD had an absolutely atrocious and clunky movement system, and everything felt like it was moving in slow-motion. Similarly, Chair in a Room's object-interaction system leaves a lot to be desired. It's very immersion-breaking to pick up a bucket with an object in it, only to watch that object clip through the bottom of the container and fall to the floor. I won't spoil things, but there's a scene in which you're required to use the Vive's trackpad to dial in the numbers on a combination lock. I'm not even sure how I ended up getting it open. Even with the numbers in hand, I had trouble controlling the precision of my selection.And yet, the game scared me to death, over and over again. I haven't been this terrified since playing the original ""F.E.A.R."" on my college room mate's laptop back in 2005. Each and every scene is oozing with atmosphere and dread. And the jump scares are punctuated very effectively with the game's sound design.By the end of Chair in a Room, I was scared to look at ANYTHING for fear that it would trigger another terrifying episode. And yet the developers did such a phenomenal job of guiding the player into those scares organically. The end became a little too expository, but (as with Alone in the Dark), I feel like the story was secondary to the raw, visceral moments of terror that lay within it.Get the game. I truly believe this is the best horror title that can be experienced in the Vive right now."

Obviously, no spoilers but there are too many amazing scenes in this chapter.The game does have a few glaring issues however, mainly the problem of items collision detection being a bit weird, especially when they interact with other items in the same world. Its a bit glitchy. Especially paper and news articles, they tend to get stuck onto each other and make it hard to pull away.However, don't let that issue detour you away from the game, it is an amazing experience, and i am afraid to finish it so quickly as i want to play it for much longer :DDevs, please add more chapters to the game or release a sequel ASAP!Thanks.Rating: 9/10"

It builds up and you feel at times you need to say to yourself ""this is not real, this is not real..."".Dont expect a gore-horror game, expect a thriller where there are some jump scares (at least I freaked a few times). All in all this is very well done and looking forward to more of the same.Thank you developers for creating a thriller adventure game!"

Each level pre-staged you in a designated zone to make the most of your available space. The story was great and the atmosphere and soundtrack were all well done and in line with the feel.My only complaint: What the heck is wrong with my hands? Try this:Take your vive controller, attach your wrist strap, and let go of the controller. See how it just dangles there all helpless and pathetic? That's what it felt like trying to pick up 90% of the objects in this game. Everything just kinda dangled from an imaginary thread extending from your hands. Even using both hands to pick something up caused it to pivot along the axis by which you were holding it. It wasn't enough to spoil the game entirely but it was frustrating."

The story evolves through a series of flashbacks to your past, as you gradually piece together your personal history and the context of the characters around you.The game is a mixture of puzzles and horror. It's genuinely scary at times. It isn't a parade of predictable jump scares: rather, it builds tension through uncertainty and an eery atmosphere.It isn't perfect, by any means.

Like many VR games it's rather short (I finished it in just above 3 hours) and quite expensive considering the short amount of time you're likely to spend with it (currently 22.99€). But considering the relatively small audience for room scale VR games at the moment, I guess the games come at a premium.But if the price is not an issue, you get one of the most immersive and complete ""mature"" room-scale VR games available. The game will creep you out at points, and scary stuff in VR -is- another level than scary stuff on your PC monitor, so you must be able to handle it. The immersion is so effective, in some scenes my thumb was hovering over the steam-menu button as an ""emergency exit"" option, scared that something could happen that would really freak me out and fry my brain or something.  :DObviously this game is not for everybody, but if you are used to horror games, it's nothing really too bad.The game has a nice variety of scenes and a satisfying ending. Sometimes it manages to be fun in a way that is not central to the game, as you can fool around with some of the more playful items in some of the scenes (building blocks!).The one thing I didn't like so much is that it relies a bit too much on music and sound effects to put the player into a scary mood, especially towards the end. Of course music is a very effective means for this sort of thing, but towards the end I was getting a little tired of the usual sound cues (they were even starting to hurt my ears a bit, as there is a lot of ""beeping""). I wish they would have made more with visuals instead of relying so much on the sound design.But with the overall experience in mind, this is a minor complaint. It's a short but well crafted psycho horror that will keep your nerves on edge at times. This game is also great for pointing towards the potential of psycho-horror VR experiences."

There is quite a bit of downtime from the horror, while you search your environment looking for clues, opening safes, etc...

Basically an escape room game.The gameplay is pretty basic, but I had a lot of trouble with some stuff like grabbing items, opening doors, etc. as the game just wouldn't allow me to do that. I also experienced a bug that wouldn't allow me to proceed at one point and I had to replay some parts, which reminds me of another problem with this sort of a game.The game has events that trigger based on when you do stuff / time goes past. This means that you don't really want to replay this as you basically have to touch every item and then wait for something to happen so that you can proceed. I didn't have to replay a lot, but it was rather annoying anyway.I also wouldn't recommend playing this if you don't have some room around you.

The main premise of the game is that the player travels from location to location and have to solve simple environmental puzzles to proceed to the next area. If the current location is too big for your VR space you can use a teleporting mechanic to move around. A chair in a Room is a fairly short experience of about 2 to 3 hours depending on how quickly you solve the puzzles.At first I really didn't like the game. The teleporting mechanic feels clunky, the 3d models are of fairly low quality and the game in general lacks polish... yet despite this I found myself completely immersed in the game in a way I have never felt before.

Big thank you to the dev for making that possible, as I have been wanting to play this for a while.Atmospherically, and in terms of Art Direction, this game is simply one of the best I have played in VR.It is absolutely terrifying, but in the most thougtful way possible. The frightening aspect is generated all through ambience and without giving anything away; there aresomejump scares, but they're far from 'cheap' jump-scares that flash in your face without rhyme or reason, and are all very tastefully done.My only complaint about this game, is in terms of the design. Sometimes the game struggles in defining the rules of interaction, which aren't always very clear.For example, in some scenarios, it takes a lot of trial and error to discover what is an interactive element, and not just set-dressing.As someone who was completely engrossed in the storyline, it got a bit frustrating to have to mindlessly canvas an entire room for long amounts of time, only to find a solution, that I would have never even remotely guessed was the way to proceed forward.With that in mind, if you pick this up, and happen to get stuck at some point for the reasons above, I wouldn't shy away from looking up an online guide to help move forward in the game so that you can continue enjoying what is a truly fantastic VR experience."

I chickened out a couple of times but miraculously managed to get through it in a couple of sessions. The story wraps up neatly and I think I'll need to replay in order to understand things that I may have missed. I'll replay as soon as Amazon delivers a new set of underwear.

The plot-twist at the end is really interesting.The price the developers asked for is definitely worth your money.The pickup machanics is still pretty bad. The devs you allow some minor object clipping through the wall/floor, otherwise picking up objects has to be pretty precise. And clipping will cause you to lose your grab and ended up with object flew out of hands.If the game was originally designed around 2mx2m or 3mx2m then the overall experiences would be a lot better.

It has taken thrillers and horror games to the next level times 10. Do you remember playing F.E.A.R. for the first time thinking ""THIS IS THE NEXT LEVEL""? This game makes FEAR look like a joke. The polish on the atmosphere is insanely well done. So many times I had chills and heavy breathing because of the anticipation.This game also serves well as a VR demo and party game. Hear me out on this. The beginning of the game is not that scary, it's just tense. It does a great job showing off the feeling of presence in VR. Secondly, if you have a bunch of friends around, it can make it easier to get through the really scary parts and also you guys can hot swap in when someone ""NOPE NOPE NOPE""s out of the game. The game is only 3-5 hours long, so savor the moments and spread this game out over a few days. Yes there are some ""jump"" scares, but it's not the traditional jump scare you would think of. It's more like, you didn't expect something to be there.PROS:-very atmospheric-great voice acting-will scare even the people who don't normally get scared-works well for a VR demo and also as a party gameCONS:-it'll ruin all other ""scary experiences"" as child's play compared to this-Some bugs are kind of annoying due to room sizing issues and puzzle bugs (i'll explain more below)-Floor calibration issues seemed particularly bad in this game, but didn't ruin the experienceSUMMARY:If you own the VIVE and can at least tolerate somewhat tense/scary situations, this game is a must. Nothing compares to it.Bugs/issues I found:A few times the room scale and positioning was way off. I freshly calibrated the room in the Steam VR setup multiple times and it still forced us to spawn inside of walls or had to break past the chaperone boundaries in order to reach a critical point. Teleporting sometimes would break or turn off in the middle of a level and we were then stuck. The floor would often be off by a few inches. Nothing game breaking, but still frustrating that this game only seemed to have that issue compared to other VR games I played with on the same steam room setup.Puzzles were usually fine and fun, but occasional puzzles were frustratingly hard to do with the controls (the combo lock for example)."

Do regular horror games just not quite do it for you or make you look away from the monitor?Well, there's no escaping the creepy **** that pops out to spook you in VR.  You turn around and it's justthere.Greenwater uses your own psyche against you. Luring you into it's depths with a bit of mystery, really grasping your full attention...And then right when you least expect it, pulls the rug out from under you and reminds you of the kind of heck you agreed to enter when you put the headset on.Mechanically, there are a number of relatively simple puzzles that mostly rely on logic and modest observation skills.  It's never particularly difficult, but does expect you to make note of your surroundings and check out things that might seem hidden at first.The game makes brilliant use of roomscale environment. Recommended is 2.5x2.5m to play without any need for teleporting (I played with ~3.5x3m).  You simply walk around your room which the game environment is appropriately sized to match and give you freedom explore intuitively and incredibly immersively.  Which you want, because the more convinced that you're really there, the stronger the sense of absolute dread and despair when things start to get spooky.Personally, shooting zombies and chopping up enemies in the dark hasn't really ""spooked"" me in VR---I feel like a badass in those when I can fight back.  When things go wrong and you're not sure if you're going insane or something is about to kill you?

A Chair in a Room, to me, all things considered (being 1st generation game and all) comes really close to these AAA titles I so much love. I believe A Chair in a Room truly is how horror games in VR should be implemented !Pros:- Great scary ambiance !! (not relying on cheap-and-easy jump scares)- Nice general storyline that grabs your attention- Sounds and music- Creative and very good use of room scaling- Since the 1.1 update the mechanics are really good (thanks !!)Improvement ideas:- Story could be a little bit more refined (some scenes are a bit hard to make sense of in the general storyline)- Because every room is basically your room space, it's really nice to move up to the wall and open a door to get to another room. It'd be even nicer if, when you get to the other room, you have the door you just opened at your back (instead of being ""teleported"" in the other room and try to ""guess"" which door you actually came from). Now, I know that, reading this it doesn't make sense as in real life your wall remains there and you can't walk through it, but maybe in the ""loading"" moment when opening the door there could have a UI indication to pivot 180 degrees and then the room would be loaded in front of you (with the door in your back). (Hope that makes sense). I believe, after a couple doors, it'd become quite a reflex to pivot during loading.Cons:- Loading times between some scenes are a little bit of an immersion breaker (minor!!)"

Imagine my surprise when I started feeling the exact same way.This game, maybe more than any other in my library right now, demonstrates the potential of VR as a medium.  I always laugh when my wife has to cover her eyes during a scary scene in a movie...I say, it's just a movie, what the big deal?  But when I say that, I can see my kitchen, my dogs, my sofa, my reality, constantly reminding me I'm safe at home.  When you are trapped in a 6 x 5 room with one of those kids you've seen in The Ring...holy crap that is a game changer.  No matter how much I kept telling myself this wasn't real, I eventually had to pull out my earbuds (and in the most extreme case, rip the headset off my head) to ""escape.""I was not expecting that reaction at all.  People have a mixed reaction to the game mechanics and story - I thought they were both fine.  But in my mind, every person with a VR headset needs to try this game, if for no other reason than to experience the power of beliveing what you are seeing and hearing (and feeling), no matter how hard you're telling yourself it's not real..."

It's a shame that this game is not featured as one of the Vive main titles.I don't want to give out any spoilers so I'll just state few pointsPros:-The Best use of Roomscale VR by far. Somebody in the Dev team who thought of this idea must be a genius. Not having to teleport through out the whole experience adds a lot to immersion. The way devs placed the game environment is just genius. They even added teleport support for ppl with smaller space. I think even if you have minimum VR space, you can probably enjoy the game with very little use of teleporting.-Beautiful graphics. The most realistic graphics on Vive so far. The Lab has good graphics but this one has the most Realistic graphics. None or very little annoying aliasing, thank god-Plot is actually well written(I don't know the ending yet but it is very engaging yet not too confusing)-Very good use of BGM and use of 3D sound effects.-No jump scare abuse that means nothing but horror.Cons-Object clipping through sometimes-Physics is still not as good as how things are in the Lab but it is not horrible.Bottom line-The Best full game on VIve so far.

I don't think a horror game or movie has ever scared me as much as this game did.  As a 27 y/o adult, nothing really scares me (unless it is something dangerous with realistic consequences), but this game gave me genuine anxiety.  I've never had goosebumps so bad that all my hairs stood up until this game.  I screamed out loud several times playing this.  It only took me 2 hours to beat the game, but I don't regret buying it all as it provided a very immersive, emotional experience.  I was sometimes too scared to even start the game, but I was determined to complete it.  It does not rely on jump scares, it is much more genuine and the story itself is scary.  There are parts where I just froze and was too scared to move or do anything.  While I recommend this to most, I can't say it's for everyone.  The puzzles are challenging, and if you don't have patience, focus, attention to detail, and problem solving skills, then this is not for you.  My wife could not get past the first level because she got frustrated from not knowing what to do and would give up too easily.  You end up getting stuck in a room and if you don't figure out what to do you could get stuck there for a while.  You build a relationship with the room and you start to feel trapped, which for me added to the creepiness and immersion-level of the game.  As a gamer I enjoyed the challenge and the determination to continue paid off.  If you are a gamer who has the patience for puzzle games and wants to get scared, this game is for you.  If you want to scare your friends, I recommend beating the game yourself first so you have all the levels available, then just throwing them into a scary part of the game where they don't have a whole lot to have to figure out, and the scares start right away.  The game gets scarier the further you get so the beginning can be a little slow for people that struggle to solve the puzzles.  Can't wait to scare my friends with this one!"

I certainly wasn't disappointed. It doesn't just rely on jump scares to get the horror across, majority of it is psychological.Story telling is good, the puzzles do take a bit of brain power in a few places, which is also good. It feels like a fully fledged game rather than a short experience too. It's also different to everything else out there as it stands. It looks good too.Overall I do really like this game, it's not without it's issues though. Most notably being glitches with the object interaction.

Without spoiling any of the story, it's the only game I've played in VR where I kept coming back to find out exactly what was happening in the story. Unlike all the glorified (but very fun in some instances) tech demos currently on Steam for the Vive, this game is just that...an actual game.Tech wise, object interaction can definitely be glitchy.

,Recommended,427760,23370184,"Posted: 3 June, 2016",all,Froolie,"This review is written on the basis of someone who rarely plays horror games and takes a general disinterest. I know from brief experience that horror games tend to have strong stories or emotional drive and I wanted to see the potential of this type of game going in with a completely fresh perspective. I felt that this title deserves a good word to try and interest as many people as possible.I think it's important to start with the outweighed negatives. This game has physics issues with interactible objects which can be disorientating at times. I also needed to use the locomotion system (beta build currently) to progress due to my smaller than required play area. In spite of these two ""immersion breaking"" factors, I felt completely involved in the surroundings and universe the developers created. A third factor would be the clue system, there have been two instances I have been frustrated enough with the time it has taken to solve a puzzle that I have felt it necessary to quit out of the game to find the answer. A secondary stronger clue system might be a solution, or just a tweak of the existing ones. I had issues in one scene in the first room and a second scene in the bathroom of the motel. Reading other reviews points out I am not the only person to have this experience, which is a shame. A linked downside to this is that I have had to replay sections up until the puzzle to get back to my progress. Some form of quick autosave would be appreciated for convenience.Roomscale horror is fantastic. VR allows for some truly unforgettable set pieces. The sound design is superb to go hand in hand with this. The soundtrack is great and it really fits with the environment. To be honest, I do notice bad textures and ""jaggies"" in games (including this), but this seriously makes you look around them out of pure fear and respect for the terrifying atmosphere. There was also some texture pop-in in the onrails sections, but this may be due to my GTX 970 being on the lower end of the performance scale. You quickly get over the videogame aspect and put your mind into the shoes of your character. I would put this title alongside other high presence games, namely The Gallery and Waltz of the Wizard. If I was more sadistic, I would actually demo this game to other people that didn't directly ask just for the sheer immersion factor. It's that good!Wolf and Wood deserve huge credit for what I consider to be the most substantial and fulfilling title I've played so far on the Vive. The Gallery was magical, but this is brutal and unforgiving and will have a longer overall playtime for the money. At 3 hours in, I am still progressing through the game (chapter 4 for people that have completed it). I believe (and sincerely hope) I am about half way though based on the Polaroids on the start room door.I wanted to write this review when my initial impressions were still fresh. In spite of this, I would still recommend the game on the basis of value for money and strength of the experience. ""A Chair in a Room : Greenwater"" sets the bar high for future titles in my opinion. I have enjoyed the game enough to put it in my current ""must own"" list of games. If you do not typically enjoy horror games or are unsure you will enjoy this, I would suggest waiting for a sale as I do not recommend missing out.I cannot wait to see what else the developers have in store and I sincerely hope they continue in this avenue of development."

It is also regularly TERRIFYING, but without ever resorting to jump scares (some things suddenly appear behind you though).All that said, it suffers from common early-VR problems (janky object physics) and common adventure game problems (hitting a dead end and feeling the need to guess what to do next).If you like adventure games, horror, or enjoy checking out the best that early VR has to offer, do not pass this one up!

It's a very polished, very nice-looking game with some light puzzle solving and slow-burning scares. Keeping with the similarities, A Chair in a Room is pretty short, lasting about two hours or so. At a $20 price it's not quite as hesitation-inducing as The Gallery's $35, but in the end it really comes down to whether you value a neat experience or a good value. The game has some pretty neat features, like how it scales each room to the size of your play area if you have above 2.5x2.5m of space, and you move between rooms by grabbing the doorknobs so teleporting is never needed unless you have a small play area.. The story is pretty interesting, even though it doesn't really come together until the very end, and they do a pretty good job of maintaining a creepy atmosphere without resorting to constant jump scares. It has the same sort of high-quality feeling to it that The Gallery had in its graphics and voice acting, and overall I felt like it was worth the price it asks for, but if you're hesitant it has gone on sale previously so you could always just wait for that."

If you are into horror games and you have a vive, do yourself a favor and pick this up.Pros:Amazing atmosphere. Its actually scary.I dont think ive ever played a game that has made me so scared. Not because what happend was the most frightening ive ever seen, but because it definitely ranked in the top 10 scariest things I've ever physically experienced. Having you be the player, walking around, exploring leaves you so immersed, at times i forgot i was playing a game. I never thought to tear the headset off my face because I was standing there confronting these things and I knew it was hopeless and there was nothing i could do but let my fate unfold.Great little touches that really immerse you in the game.The post cards have smudge marks on them from being handled with someone with oily skin. Its only noticable if you hold a card under a light and angle it a particular way. Who thinks of that?! Also, there is a moment where a bright light is shined in your face. I instinctavely held my hand up to the light to shade my eyes and it worked. Little moments like that pulled me in completely and I totally lost myself in the game. The developer did an amazing job making you feel a particular using sights and sounds. I dont think ive ever been so present in a VR experience before.Cons:Holding objects is a pain.Objects you can interact with come in two flavors, ones that you hold steady in your hand in the position you grabbed them in, and objects that kinda swing freely in your hand. I would say 95% of the objects in this game should have been the steady kind. Unfortunately, its only about half that you hold steady. This makes moving large objects very difficult, even if you use two hands. Two handed holding feels like you are grabbing two strings attached to the object and its free to spin and sway however it pleases. But even the static object holding was not optimal. If you pick something up off the floor, and try to look at it, you have to hold your controller awkwardly. Objects are held in the exact position you pick them up in. This works, but i think it would be greatly improved if they snapped to a default position in relation to the controllers orientation. That way you wouldnt need to keep picking things up and putting them down until you hold them in the optimal position for use.There is some replay value, but not much.This isnt really a con though and just kind of the nature of this expreience. I went back and replayed some portions of the game and the atmosphere stays, but if you know the solutions to puzzles and when some frightening scenes are, you can mostly get through the game unaffraid. That being said though, there were still some times when id forget something was about to happen and jump out of my skin =]"

I have a small space, but it was still plenty enjoyable and i felt fully immersed.  The settings are all very artistically done and set moods very well.The scares..... Scary moments are 10x worse in VR.  It's one thing to see it on a monitor, but another thing to be ""in"" the play space and have it all happen around you.  The dev did a great job ""prepping"" you for scares or non-scares, and by the end of it, you absolutely dread hearing some of the sound effects.The puzzles and progression are pretty straight forward.  I got a little stuck a couple of times, but it was usually because I wasn't paying enough attention to details.It looks like it took me about 3 hours to beat.... over the course of several weeks because I just can't play it for long before having to get my heart rate under control.

I'd like to see some of the content worked on though. The school locker lock was frustraitingly difficult to spin and see, when the solution would be to ""zoom"" in on the lock when picked up. Infact, most of the text could use a little 1.5 zoom when looked at. I know it may hurt immersion, but we flat out skipped some text because it was just too annoying to stick the controller against our faces. Otherwise! The story and atmosphere was great.

Some of the plot elements are slightly cliche, but it was a very nice tapestry of concepts strung together. Immersion does slide the atmosphere in the developers' favor, as I could see how several parts of the game would not work nearly as well if it were not for the VR aspect.My only complaints I really have would be about a little bit of bugginess in the adventure game ""Bring Me These Things"" part towards the end, as I was a bit lost as to what the transitionary part of the experience was, and therefore I backtracked into another room where a character repeated old dialogue.I also felt the end came pretty quick around the climax, and I expected more escalation just before it.And if there was another game with a southern gothic atmosphere, I'd like to see it explored in much more depth to the ""supernatural"" side of it, as it was hinted at to some degree.All in all, I would say this is my most immersive experience to date.

My girlfriend literally induced herself into a panic attack in a section that wasn't even particularly frightening.  It's great psychological horror where the promise of what miight be hidden in the dark is actually the most terrifying aspect.  Its not perfect.  The hit detection can be wonky.  You spend much more time than needed simply manipulating objects.  But at the end, this was truly an experience and once of the most satisfying game purchases I've had in a long time.

If you get scared easily and are wondering if you can actually handle the game, without spoiling anything, I will say that there are some spooky moments that can really creep you out, but nothing that was far too scary for me to progress.The story itself was pretty good and definitely didn't go where I thought it was going. The puzzles and such were all pretty cool and par for the course from other 'escape the room' games that I've played. There were none that I encountered that I couldn't find out on my own, though that's not to say I never used the built-in hand hint system and there were a few moments when it tool me a little over a couple minutes to figure out exactly what I was to do.I really liked how they gave instructions on using gear in the game. Putting the instructions in text on objects in the game was really, really cool. Borderline on a spoiler maybe, but I also really liked how they took full advantage over a player's looking direction.My biggest issue with the game was with the play area, though it's not all the game's fault. I have small parts of my Chaperone area drawn in a way that includes parts of my couch and recliner, since they are so low to the ground, they have never gotten in the way of RPG or FPS style games. In this game though, there's a lot of reaching and grabbing that takes place low to the ground, and that made things problematic. Luckily, I was able to push down enough on cushions or squeeze between cushions to reach low places, so it never stopped me from beating the game, but it came very close to me having to pause the game, take my headset off, and moving my couch out of the room. My space isn't small, but I just wanted to get as much as I could. Despite that, and this is where I do fault the game, it placed a small number of things actually outside of my Chaperone space, but luckily this was just space above more couches, so I just leaned over the couches to access these places in-game, but some people may actually have a wall or something that they cannot get through or passed.So, if you want to play this, it's not crazy scary but has some spooky moments, you better have a large area relative to what other games require, and if you have cheated your Chaperone space then you might want to make sure you haven't cheated it too much.  All in all, I really enjoyed the game and had fun getting spooked. Getting scared in VR is quite exciting and A Chair in a Room has only increased my anticipations of future horror games in VR.4/5"

I ended up stuck on a boat forever because something that was supposed to be there, wasn't there, and so I could not progress past that point. Early on there is a puzzle that has multiple answers based on the evidence around you, and it's the less obvious one(ie. the one that has a LOT less evidence for it) that's the correct one. This means you're down to just trial and error for it, and you might as well not even investigate anything, as the easiest and fastest way to solve it is to simply try all the options until one works. Very poor puzzle design.On the upside, the sound design is some of the best I've heard. Just the sound by itself manages to create a very spooky atmosphere.

The biggest hit to the experience came from level/object interaction, which ended up being an extreme exercise in immersion-breaking frustration. If you manage to actually get a grip on an object, it'll flop around like a fish out of water or fly across the room as if possessed. Placing things in containers or on surfaces causes them to fall through quite often. Using tools to accomplish goals to progress the story is exceptionally awkward.

After the 3rd or 4th time doing this the ball turn into a spider...so scary.Then you cover up the spider with the cup, naturally, and it disapearsm gone. Now there's just three cups on a table and behind you a small drip of water can be heard and theres a scrap of a postcard on the ground. Thats the end of the game apprantly. You can pick up the post card, look at it, nothing happens. You can pick up the cups and throw them around, you can pick up the chair and throw it around. There's nothing else to do. No more instructions from behind the screen. I stood in that room for 10 mins the first night and 5 tonight wondering if the game was bugged or what.I'm asking for a refund. In my opinion this is really bad game design.. or it's just bugged, either way I have better things to do then figure out what kind of hoop i'm supposed to jump through to progess to the next scene."

A lot of things that do happen are random 'jump scare' type stuff with sound and objects. The rest of the time is spend trying to figure out unforgiving puzzles that doesn't give too much help or hints, which can end up making you do nothing for 15 minutes. The game is also very buggy, even compared to 15+ VR games that I've tried. All the objects are always passing through, getting stuck, and teleporting around. Opening and closing doors/drawers feels weird becuase your hands will end up inside it half of the time. I think it's a good concept but they need to speed up the pacing, add more content, and fix the bugs for it to be worth the price."

It's hard to find anything and you end up clicking around for 10 minutes before your intended purpose. The the reviews. ""Somewhat Positive, Very Positive, Overwhelmingly Positive"" etc etc. Where's the star rating system that works so well for everyone/everything else in the world??? There's no middle ground, i.e., for example 3 of 5 stars on here is equivelant to another Positive and normally someone could clearly see the game is just average at best or junk and yet got a positive review.Good tactics but tactics like that don't last forever.The Playstation VR although not that great either, but if I had to choose one over the other it would be the PS4. At least in it's infancy has had a few games that are very fun.

Took me nearly 4 hours to complete toghether with the Missing Girl bonus level.What is very well done is how the game tries to scare you, very few jump scares but it's always kinda kreepy in the rooms.And IF there are jump scares, they don't ""jump"" you in a literal way like say the FNAF monsters. That's a very important thing in VR because when that happens most games shake the screen wich would (to most players i guess) give you motion sickness in VR.So special probs to the devs for taking care of their players while still scaring them.The price tag might be a liiiiitle high with 22,99€, but it is a well done game with little to no shortcomings.

At times, it seems like you have to just wait for something to happen, and there's not much that happens during the waiting. Other times, it felt the game was just downright broken.
