The ""game"" plays out like an indie short film with bizarre imagery and a pretensious ""plot"". The entire game consists of about 15 very simple puzzles mixed in with some nonsensicle cut scenes of raw meat in a sink. If Calendula's aim is to be creepy, it failed. If Calendula's aim was to deep, it failed.Is it a digital representation of reincarnation?A metaphor for the creative process of making a game?I don't know.But oh well, It is not my fault."

After solving one you get to walk a few meaningless steps in a meaningless corridor and see some really meaningless pictures, which are meant to be disturbing. There also are creepy sound effects all the time, which at least have a better impact than the rest. I guess you could say that the screenshots on the Steam shop page already spoiler you most of the game's content.I would've recommended CALENDULA if it was free. But I paid 6$ for this, which is far too much. Well, at least I can refund it right away after I bought it.(P.S.: If you're looking for a game that twists your mind, I can highly recommend The Stanley Parable. It's great.)"

For a game that is mostly made of seemingly broken features and insane surreal glitches, it tells a fairly coherent and enjoyable story. Even if you're not in it for the story, it's still a supreme mind-screw. The puzzles are brain-tingling but solvable, and each time I solved one I felt like I'd done something incredibly wrong.Note the short playtime, but also know that the game is expertly paced and just the right length for the type of experience it delivers. If you want to feel truly bewildered and slightly uncomfortable, then this game is definitely for you. It never let me get my bearings, and it was over before I knew what happened. I love it."

I loved the game... but I cannot recommend it to people, especially at the current price tag it has. The game is good, it has great atmosphere to it and its all psychological in its presentation. I love games like that. The problem here... its too short. You can get through it all well within 30 to 40 minutes and thats the game. If the price drops... I do recommend a playthrough of it then. especially if it  was on sale for a dollar. That feels like a more acceptable price tag for a game that has no real replay value. No, i am not trying to bash the makers of this game. As i said before, I loved it and I love the concept of it, its just... -way- too short. ONLY get this... if you have enough money to just blow on something you are only going to play through once, if you are willing. otherwise, give it a pass."

The well done visuals and effects got me interested, and then... what? The whole ending turns out to be the overdone ""whole thing is a metaphor for death/rebirth"" cliche? I was expecting to learn more about what was going on, to uncover some secret hidden in plain sight, have the information it wanted at the start to be used against me somehow, ANYTHING but that same cliche. The game did occasionally give some occasional good foreshadowing, but a big chunk of the disturbing imagery seems to have been put in there simply for the sake of being disturbing. I never really got invested in the game, I spent most of my playtime waiting to get to the good part.However... I don't really HATE this game. If I had, I probably wouldn't have even bothered to review it. I like the amazing potential it shows. The quality of the visuals, the effects, music, all show real talent, at least when it comes to creating an visually immersive experience.But I didn't really come for the graphics.

It has an interesting core idea and  interesting gameplay elements. But overall it has a very poor visual quality, even for an indie project. Sorry, but the visuals and the acting are bad. It does not feel as a whole, more like pieces of different things that were forcefully put together. I would rate it 2/10."

But the game resists being played, actively evading the player with its constantly shifting commands.It takes the broken menu puzzles of Pony Island and makes a complete experience of them. Thanks to the sheer originality of its execution, it's effective and engaging, and Calendula conjures up plenty of opressive tension through its disconcerting atmosphere.Between puzzle sloving there are surreal first person vignettes which form the actual ""game"" of Calendula that we're trying to play. These sections add to the disturbing vibe rather than give any real exposition or narrative, until later when we're beat over the head with the obvious symbolism.Ultimately it's up to the player to decide ""what it all means"", and I concluded with a story that works for me, although that narrative doesn't connect with the mechanics of the game in any meaningful way. They feel like seperate experiences.Still, it's a sharp and mysterious atmospheric-puzzler, even if it's intended mind-♥♥♥♥ doesn't quite come together with its mechanics in unity."

I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this game, and Calendula surprised me in more than one way. It's hard to say much without spoiling the overall experience, which I would hate to do. It's really a game you have to try for yourself, and play along with wholeheartedly in order to truly enjoy the ride. I've never played a game quite like it, and find it impossible to compare it to anything else.Sometimes, there are more to games than reaching clear goals or defeating obvious enemies. Sometimes games have a more subversive message. And, sometimes, games just like to mess with your head and haunt your dreams. Calendula is one of those games."
,Not Recommended,427810,23781944,"Posted: 25 June, 2016",all,.Frost.,"Interesting puzzle game, but way too short for the money. I like the concept of the ""game"" that cannot be played. As that is a daily problem for most with normal games. No real plot or story, but you kind of piece the puzzle together, with its bizarre graphics, photos, videos. Once the ending comes you will kind of relate the images to the answer, though this is grasping at straws.For a quick bit of entertainment, it is neither good or bad. Just an average time filler that I would get on sale. At least 75% off would be nice.Overall I give this a 2 out of 5 Beers.Cheers,Frost"

This game has no real ""game"" element to it and feels more like a neat experimental flash game I would find on Newgrounds and I would honestly recommend playing it if it released on something like that or GameJolt, however the depressing lack of content and actual scares and only a fleeting creep factor make this one tough to recommend.If you like the aesthetic and wish to support the developers in hopes for a more interesting project from them down the line, by all means go for it, however I give this game as it stands a disappointing 2 out of 5."

Only recommended if you are intrigued by bite-sized little oddities. The ""psychological horror"" tag is misleading.I've seen the game referred to as pretentious, but I think it's too innocuous to be obnoxious. However, if any hint of pretense is something that makes you erupt into a geyser of furious projectile vomit, you may want to steer clear of this one. I personally enjoyed this strange little diversion.The current asking price (6,99€) is way too high for what's on offer here - I'd advise waiting until it's on sale, unless you're like me and don't particularly fuss about your money.(My playtime does not reflect the length of the game. It's a result of me idling for cards, which takes much longer than actually finishing the game.)"

Since I must, I have to lean more towards wanting to enjoy the ""game,"" but it simply wasn't for me.Many will point out the heavy borrowing from the Pony Island concept and they're not wrong, but it's not a reason alone to dislike Calendula. Yes there a many completely original games out there, and there have and always will be games that borrow concepts from those before it. It's not a big deal, because so many great games take these concepts and do something great with them. Sometimes it's a new twist. Sometimes it's an incredible story. There's a myriad of things you can do with a borrowed concept to elevate it. Calendula did so very little to try.The atmosphere was fun and the puzzles were pretty decent. Other than that, it's incredibly short (50 minutes without much brain stuggle,) and it doesn't have much plot or heft to hold the package up. Not a regretful playthrough at all, but I have a hard time recommending it."

,Recommended,427810,28931463,Posted: 1 January,all,Robin,"TL;DR AT THE ENDCALENDULA is a puzzle game that tries it's hardest to stop you from playing. You will be frustrated, sick of seeing red but by the time you've finished the game you will be proud of the madness you had to go through.90% of the game actually takes place in the main menu of the game. When trying to start a new game or load a game, CALENDULA says you know what? You need to put some work in to actually play this game. The first few puzzles are very simple (such as your screen and mouse being inverted so you have to turn off the mirror settings in the options menu) but the later puzzles can become quite daunting.For those who are still confused, this is how most of the game works out. You try to load a game, it asks you for a password, you then solve a puzzle on the main menu to get said password and load the game. You do a brief walking section and are kicked back out to the main menu and have to do a new puzzle for a new password.While not every puzzle requires a passowrd most do and alot of the puzzles are genuinely fun and require some brainpower to figure.One major problem of the game is actually a bug. One of the rooms you go into after entering a password requires you to walk forward. Unfortunately this room bugs out and won't actually register that you've walked forward making the room unable to be completed. You have to quit and restart the game and attempt the room again (and possibly a 3rd time....or a 4th and beyond) until the room completes successfully. The developers said that they fixed this glitch but they did not and it doesn't look like they ever will.The achievements are relatively simple and easy to get, but the aforementioned glitch might possibly lock you out of 2 of the 8 achievements (like it has for me).If you like puzzle games and don't want to spend 20 hours solving them Calendula is a great game.GOOD:- Puzzles are challenging and unique- Doesn't overstay it's welcome- Has an undertone of a story- Nice soundtrackBAD:- Game is almost exclusively red, black and grey- The Eye Room glitch is game breaking and can lock you out of achievements- A few puzzles are relatively tedious (not challenging, just tedious)- The start logo appears EVERY TIME you solve a puzzle and stays for around 10-15 seconds- The attempt at the story is weak and leaves TOO much to the imagination- The few walking sections are slow and just seem totally out of place"

Imagine a game that made a file you had to read on your program files, imagine a game that sent you emails in order to continue.

I've been a horror fan for quite a while and was hoping the ""game that doesn't want you to play it"" might offer a unique take on what an experience of horror could be. What I found was a sense of isolation, being pushed away constantly and only catching the briefest glimpses of what it meant to understand something we can't really truly understand. While the game is primarily based up the recurrence of puzzles involving the title menu and briefs vignettes in the first person coupled with weird/distrubing imagery, it all forms a neat little circle. I could expound theories for a while about what it all means but I'll stick to this: its entertaining to actually enage in as a player, its imagery is disconnected enough to genuinely chill at times and it seems a welcome place for interesting theories about story. My only sticking point would be length I suppose, as I got through it in little over half an hour (I could see hitting upwards of two depending on your ability to guess puzzle elements) and aside from replaying to mine story ideas/theories, its puzzles will just become routine. Still, I think it is well worht your time to try out and if you're in a dark enough room, it'll disquiet you something fierce."

I beat the entire game in under an hour and was rather disappointed with the experience overall. There is no plot to speak of besides the game not wanting to be played and requiring you to solve about 8 puzzles, all of which take little time to solve once you read the clues given at the start of each ""section"" by hovering over the black eye. Most of your time will be spent pressing the W key to move forward in what might as well have been cutscenes.Each puzzle requires you to mess with the settings of the game or to just witness an odd event within the menu screen in order to progress, some of these puzzles are interesting, but none of them require too much thought to solve. The only good things i have to say about the game are that its music is pleasent, the style of everything is forboding and unique, and that it did manage to generate the feeling of not being able to play a game because the settings were off: irritation and boredom.Overall Calendula is a simple puzzle game with a weird, vague ""arthouse"" style of doing things. Its short, easy, disinteresting and overall not worth buying at full price, If even half price, as there are far better puzzle games with better stories that you can buy for around the same price and get much more for your money (puzzle agent for example)."

Every time you complete a puzzle you get a small walking section (where you can only go straight, and the game turns you through glitches if necessary) followed by a brief fmv clip. I'm going to spoil the ""twist"" in this review, but honestly, its Shyamalan levels of dumb.At the beginning of each level you are booted back to the main menu screen. That much you probably already know. The majority of gameplay takes place here. This is where the game is at its best. It's extremely fun to solve abstract puzzles that ♥♥♥♥ with your perception of the menus, the space around them, and the ambient audio. It's all very interesting, and I absolutely love it during this, even if it is a tad too easy.Once you solve the puzzle, you get a walking segment. The environments differ each time, but they're always fairly basic corridors. After the walking is where it gets juicy. At some point during the walk glitches will appear and the game will fade into an unsettling fmv clip that implies more is going on.The game has a ton of eye imagery, some are photorealistic during the transition to fmv. One puzzle has you go into an ingame fake chat room where somebody screams at you to ""please stop"" and asks why you're doing ""this"", then repeating ""WHY"" repeatedly before he 'logs off'. At one point during a walking section you approach a globe, and it darkens as you approach, almost seeming to mold. The game seems to be about some large world government, cult, or Umbrella-style science gone wrong sort of story. It gets you hooked the moment you start considering the first few fmvs and only stacks evidence from there.What's the ending, I hear you ask? None of the above. You're a kid named Calendula being born. The ending is atrocious.I was honestly tempted to refund this game, but seeing as how I absolutely adored the puzzle section, I've decided to leave my money with Blooming Buds.

Instead, I got barely 30 mins of playtime where I was mostly stuck on the main menu, solving very easy puzzles that mostly revolved around changing settings and clicking play. The walking segments were basically on rails: you have no control over direction you walk, cannot move the camera enough to take in anything besides that which is in front of you, and end with a cutscene of raw meat. The story was all but nonexistant, and felt like the bones of meaning were just there to give some semblance of purpose for the player to make them continue the game. I never felt ""spooked"" by this game, or intruiged. There were no elements present that haven't been done better in a different game, and I felt robbed not only by the lack of content, but also by the large claims the store page for it made, but failed to back up.

,Not Recommended,427810,29704883,Posted: 4 February,all,ScouSin,"Minor spoilers below, so heads up.Calendula is a horror game in a rising subgenre of ""haunted games"".  This type of game looks like it originated from the all too common haunted game creepypasta stories online.  I've played some games that do it well, but unfortunately I feel like Calendula is half-hearted on the haunted aspect, and has too little gameplay to be fulfilling.In terms of gameplay, most of the time you'll be navigating the game's options or interface to get a password which you need to load the game's save (actually basically ""go here to progress the game"").  The game itself asking for and accepting an arbitrary password doesn't feel very haunted.  If you were somehow progressing by adjusting the game's settings, as opposed to getting a password to input elsewhere, that would feel more how I expect a ""game that doesn't want to be played"" to act.For the horror aspects, there is some imagery that suggests there is something sinister going on, which is cool.  It also tries to create a haunting atmosphere by being vague and haunting.  I appreciate the value of not revealing the monster, so to speak, but this game did too little to suggest there was any danger, or even anything to fear.  At the very beginning there is a sequence where you play in a first person section walking down a hall slowly.  I've seen this in horror games before, I was worried about looking behind myself, but then I saw I couldn't.  I was basically on rails.  It took two more of these before I decided there were no actual scares in the game (jump scares or otherwise).  Having a haunting atmosphere is pointless if there is no chance for a pay off.  It's fine if nothing comes out at me and scares me, but I knew without a doubt halfway through that it would never happen, ever.  So I wasn't worried about anything anymore.The TL;DR version: Calendula is short, not scary, and the gameplay feels half-completed."

It takes less than an hour to beat and, to me, didn't truely offer any better meta experience than other games could (such as Stanley Parable).  The imagery felt cliche and although the ""ending"" may or may not come as a surprise to some people, to me it was fairly obvious half way through.This would have made a decent freebie browser based experience, but for me it came and went quickly, left no lasting impressions, and just wasn't worth the already discounted price.I would have loved to see them take the concepts in this game and incorporate them into something larger and more subtle."

,Recommended,427810,20921262,"Posted: 2 February, 2016",all,luukiead,"I would suggest taking this game with a little pinch of salt. The game is less 'meta' and more just plain glitchy. It's fun, and the puzzles are a great mixture between challenging, do-able, and unnerving, and the music in particular was very good, as were some of the visual elements (although not all of it- it runs on Unity, after all). But it is not horror. It's definitely creepy in parts, and if you have an aversion to glitching or technology with slight self-awareness then this may get you feeling a little panicked. What ruins it, however, is the storyline element, which is a little contrived, the allegory a little forced, and the ending less of a big spooky bang and more of a tired mumbling of ""Oh, no. Not this again!""Play it, definitely. It's a nice little indie game with a lot of atmosphere, which for the most part makes up for any downfalls."

It's not a long game either, with most achievements taken in within an hour or 2.Its biggest failing, though, is that it could've been something good, but ultimately settles for mediocrity, namely with going for a theme that is beaten to the ground, compared to its opening premise, which easily showcases the best parts of the themes it runs with. A pity, then, that it decides to discard those in favor of something more cheap, that seems profound, but ultimately isn't.Puzzles are fairly straightforward, with the exception of one particularly obnoxious puzzle. Though even that one can be solved with some patience.Overall? A 5.5/10 from me.P.S. That soundtrack is amazing."

Or rather, it wasn't nearly as deep or well designed as I expected. I thought it would something along the lines of IMSCARED mixed with a little The Stanley Parable, but it turned out to be a very simplistic puzzle game which comes down to basically manipulating the exact same mechanic in a slightly different way to ""solve"" each puzzle.As a reward for solving each puzzle you are treated to an extremely vague and incredibly brief cut scene. I got the impression that they were supposed to be very psychologically evocative and make me work to figure out the puzzle behind the puzzles, perhaps with an undefined sense of dread. This atmosphere was not effectively built up however, and the ending, while tangentially related to the cut scenes in retrospect, was pretty unsatisfying even if it was meant to be a metaphor or if we were meant to carry over the anticipated feelings of dread and anxiety from the gameplay over to the ending, neither of which I think was successfully executed if that was the intent.I got this on sale for 4.19 US, and I would probably agree with another reviewer's comments that if the game was free, I might suggest a playthrough just because the ""puzzles"" are relatively nonstandard and the intended thought process behind the cut scenes and ending is at least intriguing. However, since the game is not free, I finished it in about 40 minutes, and found it to be generally unsatisfying regardless of price, I would not recommend this title."

It will take you about 50 minutes to play through the entire thing, so I definitely wouldn't say it's worth $7, but it's a great experience.  The ending will have you thrown.  The entire point of the game is definitely unclear, and the ""cutscenes"" (points in the game in which you simply move forward through rooms) seem to be unconnected, but the atmosphere gives me shivers.Less of a game, more of an experience that you interact with.
