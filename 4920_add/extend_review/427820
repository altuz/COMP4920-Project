Some complained that their weren't enough settings...for what? The game doen't need any. Some said too expensive...really? I pay more to see a two hour movie. Some said it doesn't feel like the other Hitman game...surprise...it isn't, did you even look at the video or pictures? Talk about peas under matresses.In my opinion this game is fun and quick. I can play a fast board or several. I didn't expect anything more then what was advertised and I am very happy with what I recieved."

This is kind of like that.Baldy is in fine form. This game is a gem which has spawned a few more in the series (Lara Croft GO, Dues Ex GO). While there's no doubt this game was designed for tablets and appears to be a casual puzzle game, the port to PC works brilliantly and the difficulty is pretty much perfect as it ramps up from basic to challenging.The minimalist art style is fresh and different, sounds and music are solid and the gameplay shines as you slowly accumulate new enemies, movement options, weapons and other diversion objects etc. The game drip feeds all these pieces into the game at a consistant pace so you never feel overwhelmed. While later levels are tricky, they never feel impossible and all the information you require is pretty much on the one screen. If you really get stuck there is a hint button to basically show you the solution.The game plays out similar to a board game. You just need to get baldy to the exit square. You move your piece 1 dot and the enemies also move 1 dot. Some patrol, some just guard certain points. You'll get access to certain equpiment etc to help get you past a level or you just need to time your movements correctly. A fair amount of the levels have multiple solutions, however in general you'll notice the level layout will give you a fair idea of what is required to solve the puzzle.There is plenty of content. You'll get 8+ hours playtime if you want to complete the game 100% (with all achievements). I didn't experience any technical issues. All achievements popped. If it's on special it's defintely worth picking up."

A total of 91 levels will challenge  you in various scenario's. Most level's can be completed with common sense trail and error and process of elimination moves.Nice classic Hitman back ground music is very soothing .With 26 total achievements that are easy enough for completion gamers to reach 100%.

,Recommended,427820,29380768,Posted: 20 January,all,nerdfury,"I purchased Hitman:GO because I adore board games and puzzles, so this review is coming from someone who isn’t familiar with the Hitman franchise. For the most part, Hitman:GO was an enjoyable turn-based puzzling experience. I loved the board piece visuals, the sleek and minimal interface, and how the game would gradually introduce trickier enemies to evade and obstacles/helpful items as I progressed.  I do, however, have 2 design flaws I want to stress to all potential buyers:1) There are different level packs that you unlock by completing objectives. Some objectives, such as “don’t kill any enemies” or “don’t kill any dogs”, make sense. The “complete the level in X turns or less” objective, however, is thoroughly asinine without a turn counter. I don’t consider myself a spoiled gamer by any means, but I think it’s rather ludicrous that a person should have to count 20+ turns in their head (while also trying to solve the puzzle at hand) in order to complete an objective.2) Positioning is key in a turn-based puzzler where you need to evade your enemies. However, in some levels, certain areas of the board (and your options to move) are obscured by walls. Sure, I can use the right mouse button to reposition the camera, but this is VERY clunky.TLDR;Hitman:GO is a good turn-based board game. Design flaws prevent it from being a great game in the puzzle genre. I recommend it to board game and puzzle lovers, but with reservations."

,Recommended,427820,31985160,Posted: 26 May,all,DonRade,"I was hesitant at first to pick up a mobile port but with game being so cheap on sale I decided to try it out, and I’m glad I did. If you like puzzle games then you’ll like Hitman GO. The game is all about moving your figure around on a grid like levels trying to take out your targets. When you move, everybody else moves. Enemies have different abilities, there are pick up weapons, decoys, disguises, there are also escalators, manhole teleporters, locked doors and keys all working together to give your brain a challenge to figure out. What is also nice is that there is more than one way to finish a level. Some levels will require multiple plays to achieve 3 star rating, so there is some replayability. Overall the game can be finished and 100%ed in 7-8 hours.But one huge gripe I have with this game is its control scheme. Swiping makes sense on mobile, but not with a mouse. If your only available movement is up, down, left or right you could have used, oh I don’t know, freaking ARROWS? Or even just clicking on a spot would have made more sense than swiping. It would have been nice to at least have that option."

This game consists of short little puzzles challenging you to get Agent 47 through levels filled with guards, briefcases to collect, and targets to ""kill"".  The game plays out like a board game with chess-like pieces.  New pieces (both enemy and support for Agent 47) and new mechanics are slowly introduced over the game's missions.This is probably the first mobile game I've really played.  I do have a smart phone and a tablet, but I have virtually never use those for gaming.  I was reluctant to try this game out because of it's mobile roots, but watching a Twitch stream changed my mind.  It seemed like a lot of fun.  I was not disappointed.  I'm glad it came to PC.The game is played with the mouse only, swiping Agent 47 to the direction you want him to go.  I would definitely have appreciated a single click option.  There's no keyboard support but I don't think that's a big deal for a game like this.I do think it's unfortunate that a level editor of some sort wasn't created for this release (as suggested by other reviewers).  It would have been pretty awesome if the community could have built more levels.  The game is a bit short.  It took me about 6 hrs to complete (totally worth the $6 and some change I paid).  I was good enough that I want more."

Are you kidding me, I can't change the default controls in 2016.Turn off ""auto-camera recenter"" Some of the levels can be hard to see because they are complex and start you off at weird angles, for some reason I can ""turn the camera"" to see the level from a different angle, but if I let go of turn, the camera goes back to the default position, instead of staying where I moved it, this is especially frustrating because which direction ""up, down, left, right""  move Agent 47 is dependent on what angle you are viewing him at, this can cause you to move him the wrong direction accidentally due to a camera shift. These are PlayStation 1 tomb-raider/resident evil levels of camera control fail.No options in pause menu. You pause the game, and your available selections are ""cancel"" by which they mean ""resume"" ""restart"" which actually does what it says, and ""Quit"" which actually just returns you to the level select screen. No OPTIONS menu in the pause menu?! Am I taking crazy pills!?Game has no level creator mode, and is not on steam workshop. Are you kidding me?

Various rewarding experiences when you finally finish all the objectives when fighting against the trickier levels.I didn't notice problems or difficulties at all, except that I couldn't get achievements while playing windowed, but that's only a minor thing.

Unless you have a touch screen, it gets unbearable quickly. You move by clicking and dragging Agent 47 you want to go. He will then move one tile in that direction. You then have to move the mouse back to him and repeat the click-drag for every single tile you want to move. Especially for large levels or difficult levels where you restart alot it gets very annoying very quickly. Also, inbetween each level it brings you back to the level select just to show you an annoyingly unneccessary animation, and you have to manually select the next level rather than it just automatically contining. It might just be me but this waste of ~10 seconds inbetween every level made it so tedious and boring to play more than a couple levels at a time. If you have a touch screen then you might like it, but I was very disappointed in this game. It does look pretty, if that's any consolation."

There are 26 achievements to unlock as you go through 15 levels per box (think of it as different versions of Monopoly and having them) Where I think two of them only have 8 (based of the Hitman game levels I mentioned before).Would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys simple little time killing games/puzzle games and fans of the Hitman series."

There are 7 level sets which generally have 15 puzzles each. The puzzles are decently challenging but not extremely challenging.The interface is an obvious port of a mobile game, and it shows through in some negative ways: (i) Mouse controlling is not smooth, and there are no arrow keys to control your moves (which I would prefer). (ii) Trying to play with gamepad, the keys simply do not work, so there is no way to select although you can move around. (iii) The game is very simple, puzzles only and simple achievements, no variety in the music.Overall I enjoyed playing throughHitman Goand would recommend it.

When you start playing, there's nothing much beyond the Hitman theme to really grab your attention - the static scenes are way alien to the vibrant visuals of the Hitman games, the puzzles are all rather easy, and as a legacy of the game's mobile origins, the click-and-drag control method is a bit annoying.15-20 minutes into the game, however, it all changes gradually. You start to appreciate the expertly crafted 3D game boards (one level - one board), the excellent sounds, and may even forget about the controls. As you progress, the game keeps adding new mechanics (as it should), and while the basic level objectives are rarely difficult, many additional objectives are decent head scratchers.Altogether, Hitman GO is a very pleasant 100+ level romp through a static but very atmospheric Hitman universe, where you only need your logic skills for successful takedowns.

Does a /surprisingly/ good job of capturing that 'essence' of Hitman games: outwitting, outmanuevering, and outgunning (sometimes) your foes. The pieces feel like chess: there isn't much ""variety"" in the pieces, but they are used with tremendous skill to build puzzles that never feel samey. One of the few games I've ever felt motivated to 100%, with special seals for each level (for beating it in X # of turns, or for beating it without killing anyone, etc.) Some of these were real headscratchers, but despite not being much of a puzzle game player, I never felt the urge to consult a walkthrough. Eventually, through experimentation, you will figure out solutions.The art is fantastic. Each level feels like a little artpiece, with figures captured in a variety of poses: people half-spilling coffee, or baggage handlers frozen mid-bag toss. This is really immersive, making you feel like the Hitman: walking consciously and coldly through a world of 'little idiots' unaware and naive to your presence. Just as though the world has stopped moving, while the Hitman stalks his prey. Very cool, and my favourite puzzle game to date.If it matters: 10/10"

I never knew turn based puzzle games existed before this, but here it is, and it's quite enjoyable. The goal in each level is simple: to go from point A to point B, which sounds quite boring. But it's how you get there is what makes the game interesting. If your enemy sees you, they will kill you.I like it so much that I also have it on my phone. That's where I got it first because it's a lot cheaper. If you like puzzles and you don't want to pay the full price, I recommend at least try it on the phone since it's inexpensive. I waited for it to go on sale and that's when I bought it on steam. I love its table top board game style. I find its neat and clean design aesthetically appealing.It's worth mentioning that there are three turn based 'Go' puzzle games by Square Enix: Hitman Go, Lara Croft Go, and Deus Ex Go. The mechanics in all three games are similar but the puzzles are quite different. The initial levels are there just to make you familiarize with the game mechanics and that's why they feel very similar at first. But as you progress, you will realize that the puzzles are quite different. I own all three on my Android phone and I love them all. Lara Croft Go has only been recently introduced to PC. Deus Ex: Go hasn't been out on PC yet. Hopefully it will."

I have found only three exceptions to this on my phone travels. A FMV game called ""Tender Loving Care"". A point and click game called ""Yesterday"". And this game, HITMAN GO.Hitman GO is a minimalist puzzle game take on the complex hitman series.  It prides itself on boiling down all the complexness of bloodmoney into a simple yet challenging puzzle game (Which is better then it sounds trust me) Enough talk lets assasinate some ♥♥♥♥♥es and dive right in to HITMAN GO!STORYWhile the other Hitman Games had a rich story as the cherry on top of tight gameplay, HITMAN GO has no story and doesnt really need one. Your a hitman. Kill your way to the exit of each level. Sometimes the level exit is replaced with a random guy you need to kill. No Big Deal.PRESENTATIONThe graphics arent HYPEREALISTIC 1020P HD However. The minamalist board game style is not only really nice and easy on the eyes but also isnt distracting when you are trying to play. Even though the layout is simple you still feel like your sneaking around a airport or a suburban apartment complex. The game is usualy silent to help you concintrate, but the smoothe sounds of Ave Maria kick in in the levels where you kill your target. Which usualy calms you down from rage quitting.GAMEPLAYThere are currently 5 chapters with two half chapters inspired by some of the other Hitman Games. All in All 91 levels with scaling difficulty. When you start out, its very simple. Get to the end of the level, dont get caught, attack gaurds from behind. But more and more gameplay elements get thrown in as you proceed such as everything from guns to gaurds with dogs and tazers. Mixing all these elements in with old things you learn is great at keeping you on your toes and makes for a great puzzle experience. There are also two alternate objectives for each level which requires you to finish the level whilst also doing something, like picking up a breifcase or killing everyone. Making a bit of replay-ability.FREEMIUM ASPECTSIn the mobile version  the only micro transactions were to pay for walkthroughs or ""hints"" if you got stuck on a level. This was great because it encouraged the player to get better and find the solution themselves. In the steam version, there are no micro transactions at all, so cheat to your hearts content! WARNING IF YOU USE THE INGAME HINTS YOU WILL NOT GET A ACHIEVMENT!Ranking: FULL PRICE BUY"

An excellently crafted puzzle game that does a surprisingly great job of also capturing many of the core elements of the Hitman games. And that's on top of the beautiful boardgame/diorama esthetic that is perfect throughout. The levels do a great job of providing a steady but fair difficulty curve, with the later levels in each box, and even more so the final levels of the game, providing a very hearty challenge, with the goal of completing all the optional objectives being especially mind-bending at times. There are a few levels or objectives that can feel a bit like duds when compared to the vast majority of the levels in the game that are great, and the camera/controls can be a bit of a pain in some levels (even with the alternate camera angles). It is also worth noting that I played entirely with a controller, and the game controls very well with one.All in all, Hitman GO is a puzzle game that has very simple mechanics at its core, with many layers of complexity steadily piled on throughout to keep those core mechanics feeling fun, with all that wrapped up in an awesome aesthetic. And that's exactly what I want from a great puzzle game. I'm looking forward to one day being able to buy Lara Croft GO again on Steam, as well as Deus Ex GO."

All in all, this game isn't bad at all especially for a game that is made for the app store.

It is even more weird when you realize that there is a click mechanic in the game (for sniping and throwing rocks for example), so I guess someone in the management didn't want to invest in an obvious improvement over the mobile version.

That it exists at all is honestly something of a surprise, and that it pulls it off, a pleasure. Both, however, pale next to it's true achievement: feeling enough like a Hitman game to wear it's name with honour.At least part of this is admittedly down to the aesthetics. Each level is presented as a physical game, each hit as a series of wooden boards, and everything from guards to 47 himself as little wooden game pieces that click around with a wonderful tactility. There's no throat slitting. There are no “accidents.” Taking someone out means taking them off the board, an unseen hand carefully putting them to one side until the map is done. When 47 himself slips up, he's also just knocked over with a click of pieces coming together and the board quickly reset for another attempt. It's not instant, but it's fast enough not to be annoying."

Previously on mobile, with fantastic art style, ambient music and absolutely lovely environments inspired by physical board games and dioramas that look even better in higher resolutions, GO is still a game I adore.It uses all classic Hitman gameplay mechanics, such as disguises, timing your movement, learning enemy pathings, hiding in plain sight (here with help of a plant), sniper rifles and of course, 47's trusted Silverballers and mixes them up to create an enthralling little title that's both easy to get the hang of and difficult to master. Hey, it's just like the regular Hitman games!GO starts easy and slowly introduces more gameplay mechanics to the mix, ramping up the difficulty. The game is never too easy or too hard and even though I finished it multiple times on my Android device, I still have trouble with some challenges.Unfortunatelly, the only problem I had with this game is still present in this version - the challenges are uninspired, usually consisting of picking up the briefcase or finishing the board in a set amount of turns. In most cases, those challenges also cancel each other out (in most cases, you cannot waste turns on the briefcase when you're trying to finish the level fast) therefore, for hitting that 100%, you will have to finish the levels multiple times.The boards are never as long for it to become a hassle though and coming up with different strategies for different challenges starts feeling desirable as the game piles up its mechanics.I never found it frustrating or cheap, the difficulty curve is perfect and I would totally recommend this game for everybody.

For fans of the Hitman series there's some nostalgia value to the level designs but that's as far as it goes.I put about 10 hours into it to get 100% achievements; if you aren't going for perfection (there's a main goal and than bonus objectives) on each level you could probably finish the game in half that time.

If you want to get the objectives you are locked with a pre-determined move to complete it. It might be good for challenging your brainbut it's more of a trial and error to get it instead of actually using your analytic skills.OST is pretty average and no actual story. (it's made not to have any)The control isn't comfortable either. There is no indicator if you've dragged your character. The objectives only shows up at the game which is ridiculous since it's supposed to be a to-do list before you start a level.

And I've bought some sh*tty games.Suffice it to say that this is like a board game, you maneuver the Hitman around the board, attacking other pieces from behind or from the side.  When you ""attack"" a piece, it gets flung off the board like a chess piece.  It was cool like the first time.I guess there's a kind of caveat emptor that comes into play when purchasing Steam products.  And ultimately it's on me to make sure that I research the game that I am intending to purchase.  I made a poor assumption that this was turn-based in the vein of ""Silent Storm"", where you could strategically maneuver the Hitman around and perform various actions like you can in the FPS.It's nothing like this.  Essentially it's like a big game of ""Sorry"".  Only ""Sorry"" is at least fun when you're drunk and you can flick the pieces off the table and p*ss off your friends.  There is some strategy involved, and perhaps I could have tried it a little longer to truly get the feel.  But I was horribly disappointed in this game, it was so much different than billed and expected.What else to talk about?  You have to drag and drop the pieces with the mouse...which is pretty annoying.  My understanding is that it's a port from a mobile app.  But would it have been that hard to make the pieces easier to move?  There are only about four things you can do and moving the pieces is a big part of it.The game boasts many ""levels"".  The first ""level"" (1-1) involves you maneuvering the Hitman into the city sewer, two drags and you're ""done"".  You don't even get any decent graphics of the Hitman grappling with a manhole, no cut-scenes of him clambering down.Honestly, I thought this was a pretty obvious money grab and attempt at squeezing some cash out of established fans.  I got news for you, Square Enix -- the Hitman franchise ain't all that fab any more and hasn't been any good for years.  Maybe try to go back to the original formula -- sneaking around and garroting people.Don't waste your money.  Or, if you do, then don't blame me."

Overall the game is pretty much the same the whole way through but things added to change it up and make it more difficult such as disguises and new enemies.Every level has three goals. One of which is always get to the end location or get to the location where you can kill a target. If you complete one or both of the other two goals then you must get to the end to actually have the goals listed as completed. The other two goals range from getting to the end within under a certain amount of turns, picking up a briefcase, killing all enemies, etc.The game doesn't change much, but I still enjoyed it for a few minutes at a time. I personally wouldn't play it in long bursts because it can seem very repetitve that way.6/10bottlehead"

If you don't have gamepad, borrow one from your friend (xbox controller works perfectly) and play that way, because playing it with the mouse feels really awkward.Before I finish, a little story:At first, I downloaded the game's apk file from somewhere and played it on my mobile phone -at its launch-.Then I played every single level again using another apk of the game with the latest updates.Later, I realised that update is a problem for the pirated version of the game and I was unfair to Square Enix.After I bought it for my phone, I played it for the 3rd time with the latest updates.Then I saw the definitive edition's announcement.I thought that I should buy it too and play it all over again with the petersburg episodes on PC.Moreover, I sent SE a mail with my apologies, seriously.The funny thing is, they replied with a humourous language and thanked me :D#Discussions_QuoteBlock_AuthorHi Burak,We’re super glad to read your sweet comments, it’s a great reward for the team ! :) Well, the purchasing is also part of the reward so we thank you for that too, not without mentioning that Agent 47 might become kind of nervous when people tend to pirate his stuff you know :p :)Thanks for your feedback Burak ! :)Cheerslol"

Not a big deal, but silly. The Windows Store version also lets you use the arrow keys to move.

It's a whole new sexy twist.This Hitman-themed puzzle game is carefully crafted in detail. Each and every level is carefully designed to look just like a normal game board, but don't let the board-game-like appearance fool you. The game mechanics is very easy to understand, which leads to intriguing puzzles and challenges it offers. Sure, you won't be able to be so creative at eliminating your enemies like many Hitman games, but it still gives you some room to think of other possible solutions, leading to completing challenges. Also, like many good puzzle games, you will be delighted to be able to solve it and would wish to see your own solution again. You might even think ""Wow I never thought I could do that. That's amazing!"". The soundtrack within the game is also very cool. Along with the lighting and the board design, this is the sexiest Hitman I've ever seen.On the downside, the number of levels in this game is too few, and I can finish the whole game in a couple of days. I wish it could have more levels than this, or just give us regular updates for new levels just like the 2016 Hitman. Also, yes, this is just the same Hitman GO on iOS and Android devices, so if you have played on one of those devices, I'm afraid you'll be playing the same levels all over again with more beautiful graphics."
