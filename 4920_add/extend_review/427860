I like how challengin it is early on and how careful you have to be in how you manage your colony. And the story is very interesting, unfortunately you have basically no say in how it really unfolds.I didn't think this was the case at first. Many of the descisions you make clearly effect things like morale, the health of your colony, and so on. But for me part of the fun of a game like this is seeing what happens when you go back and make different choices. My first game I lost pretty early on. The second time, I make it to the end and won. So I went back to play a third game, to see what paths the different choices led me down. And this is where the game let me down.As a heads up there are some spoilers for the early game here.One of the early decisions in the game is wether or not to risk getting a reactor, which you need to power your base, but is damaged and leaking radiation. Having won the game once, I wanted to challenge myself, and see how long I could keep the base going without getting the reactor. I was enjoying the challange, until a story event happened. An explosion in the reactor I didn't have. The worse part is the mechanic of the game was clearly going to force me to either go get the reactor, or loose. But having a scripted event happen, that didn't reflect the current state of my base. And suddenly it was no longer fun.All the decision I had made on my first play through no longer felt like they mattered. The game presents you with several moral choices, ask you to decide wether you will turn your security force into a secret police that crushes any dissent, or try and retain a semblance of law and order. And although you often see your choices reflected in the systems of the game, the moral level for instance, if it's not reflected in the actual story you are told, what's the point?The characters are intereseting, and the early game seems to promise the chance to learn more about them. When I won the first time I assumed that I had just missed opportunities to learn more about their past, and to trigger other story lines. Maybe I did, maybe I didn't. But I can't say I'm interested in going back anymore because now I'm spending lots of time clicking through lots of text I've already read, in hopes of find another story line.It's a wordy game, and that's not a bad thing. But if you're going to ask your player to read that much and offer all these choices, then they need to be able to effect the narative. Otherwise, you should just make a graphic novel, and not bother trying to make it a game."
,Not Recommended,427860,21715167,"Posted: 8 March, 2016",all,-CML-kamerosa,"This game plays like a early access title.  Much of the game feels unfinished or needs more balancing.  Fear the RNG because it doesn't take much in the first week of the game for a single disaster to force a roll back.  Additionally the mechanics of the game such as health or morale are completly hidden, you have no idea how much harm reduced rations will cause or what direction your popularity is going.  The popularity is especially important to know if you decided to allow elections, I had good morale but had no idea if this meant that I would be elected over my rival.Overall, don't buy now.  There is a lot of potential but the game needs to be finished first."

But after a while you start to notice that how well you do in the management/base building section doesn't really affect the story. Also the story kind of lost momentum in the third act.Was hoping for a game that captured the beauty of Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri but replaced war/diplomacy with exploration and discovery and an intrigueing narrative.Instead it's a (very good) visual novel with a minigame.Would still recommend as I enjoyed myself though.

The story and science fiction elements of the game are very impressive. It is written well, and the graphics are beautifully drawn.The colonial management in the game is very difficult, but incredibly addictive. Working out strategies to mitigate the (inevitable) casualties your colony is going to suffer is a lot of fun given all the hardships you face. The choice of the main player character also added different story elements to the game. While your player character choice doesn't diverge the story dramatically, there were enough changes to satisfy me and provide replayability.I played the Next World when it first came out and thoroughly enjoyed the original. There were a number of elements I felt could have been improved, and when I discovered that the new DLC (Planetary Exploration) was available I downloaded it immediately. The new DLC is a great addition that improves on an already very good game. The most substantial change relates to, unsurprisingly, planetary exploration. While there is still a very welcome degree of randomness, the inclusion of a planetary map is a good one. This is in addition to the many new exploration events that enhance the game. In some ways the game felt more challenging, but on reflection this was getting used to the new options available to the player. I also welcome the enhancements to the power-management event chain regarding the decision whether to pursue a fusion reactor or a renewable energy strategy.My young son and I both enjoyed playing the Next World thoroughly. I am looking forward to future DLC and further developments — there is definitely potential for the game to be enlarged in a very big way. I recommend."

None of these things truly stand out as exceptional, but together they produce a game that I found both addictive and memorable.While it lasted at least, be aware that this game is 'very' short. While that time is lengthened a far bit by the game being pretty hard (in a good way), the story lasts about four hours.Those hours are certainly good ones however, and the art and moral choices both stand out as being a cut above most offerings at this price. Together, this game is very easy to recommend."
76561198046975243,Recommended,427860,21710627,"Posted: 8 March, 2016",all,Crax,"This is a great game. Individually the story or the gameplay doesn't really shine - I guessed the plot from a mile away and the endings really aren't anything special; the characters aren't too fleshed out beyond the first real chat and does not have special events specifically tied to them; the enigmatic elements of the game never really play an actual role and many climatic events just fell short despite its initial buildup; and the gameplay gets really bare when you realize that you've exhausted all possible events you can find in just, well, 3 hours.In a way this feels more like an Early Access Game or a poor man's King of Dragon Pass. However, overall the game is a fantastic experience. The writing is really solid and the sprites and background art matches each other and the game perfectly. I've seen too many VNs out there with clashing arts/color tones that just ruins the overall experience before the player even go through a few lines, and I'm glad this VN isn't suspect to that flaw. The survival gameplay reminds me a bit of Planetbase (and thankfully and obviously considerably less difficult) and if there are additions of more events in the future I am certain that it'll be enjoyable enough for me to have another go.As for things that need to improve, I'll try and keep it simple:1) More events in general. Exploring the planet gets boring real quick when you can count the number of events on two hands.2) More character specific dialogues/events, I mean, I would really like to know everyone more and see how they act under pressure. Also would like to see more events relating to the (spoilers!) AI Janet and alien microprobes.3) Linear events such as (spoilers!) the kids being infected by microprobes etc need more elaboration and impact, and I don't mean hey-did-you-notice-the-kids-are-getting-more-violent? kind of one glance mentions. Something like a scene where Michael or Shen's sister going super violent and beat the crap out of someone. It's old, but it works more than a scene where the kid's tearing apart his toy.4) More effects! Sound effects (explosions, beepingpeople screaming, chaos, raiders talking to each other etc), visual effects (again, explosions! etc).5) Minor UI issue I have but the mouse scroll-backlog is like a must feature on VNs. Also, your save screen is really un-user friendly.6) Gallery feature please! What's the point of having cool CGs, when you can't just refer to a CG Gallery and relieve them easily?"

Then it dries up a bit and you are left with managing your colony which is a bit shallow. By the time you get enough buildings to support your population there is nothing to build or do anymore, except wait for the next story event. The story wraps itself up in about 70 or 80 days. Maybe faster for some. The maker said he made the game based on the old ""Outpost 2"" game from '97. I think you should buy this game on sale for 5-8 dolars or euros...

Emotionally impacting in the same way as games like The Last Federation are. I would say, paradoxically, it is worth the money despite being so very short, although if you want a high gameplay-to-money ratio, wait until it goes on sale.Gameplay wise, this is Tharsis but without nearly as impossible odds. Instead of mission failure when the dice fail to go your way, you instead lose people. You can stand to lose a lot of people before game over, but you'll always wonder if you could have saved more. The early game is punishingly hard, and although I'm often against that, here, that's the way it should be. It fits the situation. It's as desperate as the narrative says. Quite refreshing.It's hard not to feel a sense of accomplishment if you manage to win on your first time through."

I love playing Faster Than Light, and there are other games I have played in the past that could be considered difficult. The Next World though, can be quite hard.Even with a good strategy you can succumb early to a no win situation developing simply because you didn't get lucky with some of the random events. Some people may complain that this makes The Next World a bad game. This cannot be further from the truth.Sure, failure may seem inevitable on some play throughs, but the ones that you win against all odds balance out the losses for me. There is an immense sense of accomplishment with reaching a win condition when the entire game is rooting for your loss.The story is good, interesting, and compelling.

This game has been compared to Dragon Pass and Alpha Centauri, but having played both of those I fail to see the link. Beyond the 'those games were actually fun' bit, Dragon Pass actually has your storyline actions majorly effect what happens in the game, which Next World does not, and is far farer in gameplay. Meanwhile, the only link I can find to Alpha Centauri is the line it Next World feeds you when you click on the exit button, and the fact that the game is set on an alien planet.I can see what the designers wanted to do, but as is they should be ashamed to be taking our money, much less putting out an 'expansion pack' that seems mainly to serve to make the resource situation even more punishing, as now you have to explore before scavanging."
