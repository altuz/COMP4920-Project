,Recommended,427910,24452735,"Posted: 21 July, 2016",all,winteryknight,"OK, so I've now played 25 hours of this game, and I'm ready to leave a preliminary review, based on beating the level 5 and level 10 bosses.I have played and completed a lot of dungeon crawlers like the Might and Magic series, Wizardry, including Wizardry 8. My favorite is probably Wizardry 8. I have also played Legend of Grimrock (not finished) and Legend of Grimrock 2 (finished). I also finished Might and Magic X: Legacy.This game is very fun, and you can play it while doing other things. I like to play while listening to podcasts, and it lets you play in full screen while being able to click out to another monitor. The game is not nearly as unfair or frustrating as Darkest Dungeon. The graphics and animations are simple, the sounds need work, etc. But the gameplay itself feels solid. There is auto-mapping. You can see the information you need to make decisions about whether to buy X and whether to equip X compared to what you have. (They could improve this by allowing you to switch character when you are in the equipment shop).The town buildings are upgradeable. All of the classes felt useful. I did not run short of money. There is less grinding than in the Etrian Odyssey games, and no farming of components (which I hate).I had a question about a design decision and the developer responded to my concern within 24 hours. I think we are likely to see good support if you do find any defects.I like the music, it's very catchy. It's not Etrian Odyssey, of course, but I like it.Basically, the game feels good. It is FUN to play. Well designed, no crashes in 25 hours of play. I paid full price for the game ($15), and I think it's worth that if it goes to 25 levels / 50 hours of play. I really like the paladin class, so be sure and get one of those when you beat the level 5 boss. Also, note that when items / upgrades have an amount in gold and an amount in signets, YOU CAN PURCHASE WITH EITHER GOLD OR SIGNETS. Both are earned by exploring the dungeon and clearing floors. There are no in-game purchases.I buy pretty much every game of this type, and this one is getting played more than most. Highly recommended."

76561198012098388,Not Recommended,427910,31207014,Posted: 17 April,all,Foolio,"This game is nothing like Legend of Grimrock or any of the might and magic serieces. There is no exploration. There is only the most minor variation in everything you face. There are no problems to solve or even levers or buttons. All rooms are 3x3 with nothing to interact with other than an occassional chest or lore book. Items have poor descriptions and abilities are poorly defined. There are stats that are in the game and listed on items that are no where to be found anywhere else. Interactions are unrefined and many typical visual queues are missing from combat.There are doors that are impossible to interact with, saying they have triggers elsewhere, but there is nothing in the world to interact with. There are also locked doors on every few levels, that don't open with any of the keys you find. The game is also very easy with no difficulty slider and ther are only two options available in the options menu.I'd close by saying that this game feels like it was developed either by people that don't play video games, or that it was so poorly funded that even some of the most basic features you'd expect out of this type of dungeon crawler were omitted.I consider it a poor buy even at $4.99."

You don't get an opened space environment though hence the fights lack that additional element of positioniong yourself before a fight starts.Visually the game is ""ok"" - no outstanding AAA graphic but it is good enough.Personally i didn't get hooked like with Wizardry 8 (duh, i doubt there will ever be a game like that again) but playing in short bursts of time per session did the trick for me.On a side note - kudos to the Dev. He did stay in contact with customers and often asked for input. A big + in my book."
76561198011891156,Recommended,427910,24683143,"Posted: 2 August, 2016",all,Jargonaut,"I normally play RPG Maker games, but do play Rogue like games occassionally too.I enjoyed this game very much and have already spend 55 hours on it and am still extremely interested in the game.Let me share with you why I like this game, and what make it so captivating.Firstly, this game is fun, and can be completed in short sessions.You start off with a team of 4 but should increase it to 6 as soon as possible to give you more firepower.Then, it is a matter of short and fun trips down the dungeon to get more XP and items.I believe it is the strategic approach that make the game real fun an interesting, and if you find the right approach, it will maintain your interest in the game.The way I normally play roguelike games is to go as far down the dungeon as I can. However, this approach is not really effective with this  game, because when you die, you lose all the items that you are carrying in your inventory, and the items equipped on your dead character. Hence I have to take a totally different approach when playing this game with the goal of NOT dying.The way that this game is setup involves a boss guarding the stairs on every 5 levels. Usually these bosses are difficult if you are not fully prepared. You can leave the dungeon and go all the way back to town anytime you from ANY level once you find a stair. However, you can enter the dungeon at intervals of every 5 levels once you defeat the boss and find the stairs too.So, to prevent unnecessary deaths, I do not face the bosses until I am fully prepared. I make short trips of 1 or 2 levels to gain more XP and upgrade better gears. I also make use of the facilities in town to Enchant or Fuse gears to get good items. Furthermore, I also farm for Epic Gears, which are the best in the game. Only when I feel that I can kill all the monsters easily, then I approach and kill the bosses guarding every 5 levels. So with this strategy, I have not died once, and have got down to level 30, killing 6 bosses, and got about 25 epic gears in the process. Like I say, the fun in this game is making short trips, gaining more fighting power, and making sure that your characters do not die.I have experiemented with many different party setups but found this party of 6 extremely effective:=== 2 paladins, 2 mages, 1 cleric, 1 warrior. ===With this setup, you can have 3 tanks (2 paladins+warrior), 3 healers (2 paladins+cleric) and 3 strong casters (2 mages+cleric). Boss fights can be extremely tough and you definitely need 3 tanks in front and 3 dedicated healers to keep your party alive. Furthermore, the casters are the one that does the most damages with their AOEs that can wipe out an entire battlefield of monsters.So, far I am only half way done with the game (killed 6 out of 10 bosses) but I know  that I will be having many more hours of fun with this game!! I will give another update later when I finish the game too.I highly recommend this game to anyone who like to play in burst of short, fun-filled game sessions"

If you choose next level, you're stuck there until you find the stairs or your party wipes, whatever happens first.

This one is decently made but nothing special....plays just like all the others like it.  Nothing remarkable but nothing horrible about it.Pick it up on sale for sure if you are into this type of game.

I just like to say if other big name companies emulated this developer gaming would be excellent.  The devloper has been constantly adding content since leaving Early access.  I am pretty sure its a one or two person team so the amount of work and love shows.The downs to this game, a lot of content needs grammar checking and most of it seems to be lifted from World of Warcraft.  There is really only one thing to do in this game go to the tower and kill stuff, go to the next floor and repeat.  While not bad as fluff time killer, it gets stale quickly.  There are some 'Boss' Battles but mostly just the same sprites with different names.  The loot is somewhat bland too as it mostly just stats and higher damage, no elemental effects on them yet.  Character customization is somewhat limited and you can only start out as Fighter, Priest, Mage or Rogue other classes are unlocked by beating certain levels, but you have to recruit the class (which is random).  Also it seems like the Rogue is pointless as they can't disarm or detect traps, they are a pure DPS class at the moment.  Lastly weaponry and armour seem limited as well and currently there are no bows, or crossbows (there are staves and wands though).All in all I guess for the price its okay, but other than I am bored type of game there is little to keep you coming back to replay."

While this doesn't match LOG2's depth and polish, it is still undeniably fun. I like it most for the ability to do short jaunts into the Tower that can take 15 - 30 minutes. Whay I don't like is the crashes that happen when I leave the game idling for an extended period of time. Thankfully, it saves after each battle, so this is more an annoyance.If you're looking for a good dungeon crawler with lots of combat, it's a good game to pick up.I look forward to future updates."

That is somewhat offset by ridiculous boss fights - way too much hp.I think it should be a little more balanced:Normal mobs should only rarely drop 'rare' items, and they should drop less items. Even though you have lots of bag space, you're currently tossing stuff left and right.Bosses should be about 10% easier, and normal mobs should hit a little harder making getting through each level a bit more challenge.I think there should maybe be a bit more 'quest' involved instead of just 'kill x number of y'. I realize the game isnt really developed to include a quest line, but something like that would be a bit more fun (find a certain treasure, somewhere in the next 5 levels maybe?)All in all a nice game, well done, and I want to support indy developers.

If you buy this game you will get an Infinite Roguelike Tower, with randomly generated enemies, loot, and levels. Allowing endless play, essentially. You level up, get better gear, and define your character as you progress through the game.You will NOT get award winning story, an open world RPG game, another COD spin-off, or another CS: GO spinoff, you won't get a survival game, and you certainly don't get some music rhythm game. You get a roguelike, endless tower exploration, dungeon-crawler game.If you're looking for a compelling story, look elsewhere, if you're coming for an interesting game that's very relaxed and doesn't require a ton of concentration or focus, this is your game.Now, on to my experience with the game.I generally play Zavix Tower on one monitor while watching YouTube, listening to podcasts, listening to audio books, listening to music, or doing work on my second monitor. It doesn't require you to always be alert, the combat isn't so difficult if you even think about looking away you get ruined so hard you and everyone you've ever loved dies.If you don't like Roguelikes, you probably won't like Zavix Tower, if you're on the fence or do like roguelikes Zavix Tower's a fun game. You can adjust the difficulty nicely, so if you're a hardcore gamer it's not a cakewalk, and if you just want to casually play you don't have to worry about giving the level 0 Slime the wrong look and getting absolutely ruined.In short, Zavix Tower is a roguelike, if you go into it expecting to play a roguelike you'll enjoy yourself, if you go into it expecting anything else you WILL be disappointed.I'd give this a solid 9/10 and recommend you purchase it, especially on something like the Steam Summer Sale."

A turn-based, old-school CRPG dungeon crawler with nice random levels and loot.  The features are decent for the price.BAD:  I've had a few crashes.  Some parts of the game don't seem to be done yet, and it feels a bit like beta.  The developer is updating it literally daily, though.  At this time, crafting doesn't seem to work on items that your characters have equipped.  There are some other little bugs, like sometimes characters can't be seen in the blacksmith shop, and sometimes a right-click on an item makes it temporarily vanish.  Some obvious features that would be easily implemented are just missing, like sorting your bags by value (since you have a fixed carrying capacity, and you want to replace junk); adjusting formation in the dungeon when you find another hero to join your party; and comparing found rings to BOTH ring slots simultaneously, instead of just one of them.GOOD:  It's a fun game in the vein of the Wizardry series with random maps to explore!  So far, there's no pay-to-win and no ""expansion packs"" -- you buy it, it's yours.  There are levers, keys, boss encounter set-pieces, and you have to unlock the higher tower levels and classes by exploring.  The combat is fun and sufficiently challenging without being absurdly hard.  The classes seem to play differently and the loot is randomized and fun.  You can finish a dungeon level quickly; it's kind of casual, and gives you an old-school dungeon crawling fix when you need it.

Though the fun won't last for more than a week in my opinion.* Working toward unlocking new content and powering up your hereos is satisfying.Cons* Easily the worst part of this game is the UI. Especially in the earlier stages when things are very new to you, figuring out which items might be upgrades for one of your six party members can take awhile to sort out, especially when an item has stats useful to multiple classes. It gets a little better as you play with the same group for awhile, you just remember what you're wearing already and can save some time.* The game does not give you enough information about your abilities and talents, specifically talents. The types of players playing dungeon crawlers are number junkies, the descriptions with many talents are too vague. Typos are not uncommon either which gives the game a rushed, unprofessional feel to it.* Graphics are on the bad side. I mean this in multiple ways. Models are reused too often, the rooms on every floor all look the same, the layouts are 90% 3x3 rooms. In addition, the graphics are kind of cartoonish and just not very enjoyable to me, especially after recently playing the dungeon crawler The Fall of the Dungeon Guardians also made by an extremely small team, but much more polished.* Sound effects are very low quality as well, and often reused for many abilities.ConclusionThe game has potential, but I feel it was rushed and released too soon. The developer seems to be active on the forum and passionate about his product which is a plus, it gives me hope that at some point this game will be more to my liking. But right now it falls short and is too shallow. I regret not refunding this game, but I wanted to give it a fair shake and play long enough. After six hours, I can concluse the game is not for me."

In that way, it reminds me of some of the first Dungeons and Dragons sessions I played (and ran). It's not JUST about that of course, that would wear thin awfully quickly. There are a few other mechanics that help round out the experience. When you find the stairs that will let you exit the tower or proceed up to the next level, do you bail or do you take a chance and risk a total party kill?I almost wrote ""there's no story"", but then I remembered that there actuallyisa story.  It obviously made a deep impression on me. :)  Let's just say it's not crucial to game play, in my opinion.  And having an inconsequential story is far better than having a plot that follows a poorly written story.  So, your characters meet in a tavern and decide to explore the big tower in town....In this game you run a party of adventurers. You start out with your party of four, and can hire or pick up others along the way.  You can outfit them, arrange them in front and back row (and here the game helpfully describes the purpose of a given spot, whether it's more protected or more likely to be attacked).  You have various attack you can use for the various classes, and it's up to you to bring some sort of strategy to the individual turn-based attacks.  In that way, it's also like a classic tabletop game.  Bad decisions or bad luck will cost you, and you will have some tough fights ahead of you regardless of how cautious you try to be.  Characters can, and will, be killed.  Luckily, they can be brought back to life.And lets talk about characters.  The game reminds me of an old classic called Dungeon Seige. Once characters joined your party, they didn't talk at all.  Any personality they developed was what you game them along the way by watching them succeed or fail.  You saw who the weak links were, and who would come through time and again in the crunch.  In Zavix Tower you can actually develop the characters a bit more, but in the end they are who you make them.  And a game with no voice acting always beats a game with terrible voice acting.It's a fun game. It's casual game.  I haven't had any issues with crashes. It all works as intended for me. Some doors have locks that require a key. Some need you to find pull a lever on a wall.  At least the lever is guaranteed to be on the same floor!The only thing I'd like to see - that I admit I haven't looked into yet - is the possibilty of using your own avatars for the characters.  The game comes with a fine starter set, but eventually they become specific characters and not generic pictures. For the sake of longevity, or to add in some characters you already have icons for, custome avatars would be a plus.If you're looking for a fun game of looting a giant tower for treasure, mixed with straight-forward combat strategy and turn-based flow, this is worth a try."

Oldschool, but fun.The game gives you a few classes with the ability to unlock more as you progress through the game.Looks like you can take up to 6 characters with you (only 4 at the start).A nice thing about the game is it has a nice skill tree for each class and you can manually increase your characters stats at each level. you get 3 stat points per level, plus the ones your race normally gets. You also get 1 skill point per level. This allows for a decent amount of customization.Gameplay:Pretty standard FP-Dungeon Crawler. Tile based movement, which works fine. Though could be a bit smoother in my opinon but it works quite nicely overall.The game does have a real indie/individual feel to it (in both the good and bad way).Honestly, this feels like a game your buddy made that your playing through.

,Recommended,427910,33770462,Posted: 24 July,all,Rafael M.,"Do you know those days when you want to play an uncompromising RPG, totally focused on gameplay and without having to read tons of dialogue?Zavix Toweris perfect game for moments like these. Developed by Batholith Entertainment, Zavix Tower can please you if you’re looking for an infinite and procedural generated dungeon crawler.First of all, it's necessary to make clear that the production of Zavix Tower is simple. That is, the graphics are basic, there are only few songs, the sound effects are weird (but you will get used to them) and there is a bit of a delay in the combat animations. So if you're looking for something immersive, go away. But if is the gameplay you value the most, you will find here a fun, addictive and very deep game.Zavix Tower is one of the few RPG games that achieves the feat of making all character attributes useful. When farming your heroes, even if you decide to focus on attack or defense, you cannot leave aside other attributes like agility and intelligence, exemplifying. For example, if you don’t update the dexterity, it will be much harder to hit any physical attack, and if you leave magic power with a few points, all your mana attacks will be limited. This is a very good design choice that gets players out of the comfort zone.The loot literally flows through the dungeons, just like in Diablo, and the equipment and armor follow the same style of Monsters' Den: Book of Dread – they are full of attributes, there are various levels of rarity and it’s possible to make very creative combinations. In total there are seven classes of heroes, more than 100 skills, about 30 different types of monsters, 10 unique bosses and procedural generation for both the dungeon and the equipment that can be found during the adventure, which is endless. Yes, this game is infinite and can be played at ease and without limits, although the plot (which is presented in excerpts from books) will end on the 50th floor of the tower.The gameplay is almost entirely within the dungeons of the tower, but you can also choose to go back to the city when finding the exit of each floor. In the city it’s possible to accept quests, recruit heroes, revive dead heroes, buy and sell equipment, among others. Played in first person, just like the games of the Gridder RPG genre, Zavix Tower is great choice for Wizardry fans looking for a similar experience, but not as punitive, and more focused on combat. This is the perfect game to spend time playing uncompromisingly.As negative points, I stress again the simple production, which may displease some. Even so, if you're after a fun and strategic dungeon crawler totally focused on the gameplay, Zavix Tower can prove to be a pleasant surprise.Pros* Fun and addictive* Lightweight and well optimized* Great procedural generation system* You can save progress at any time* Simple in mechanics, but complex in its tactical varietyCons* Little variety of environments and music* Weird and scarce sound effects* Delay in combat animations"

76561198039517334,Not Recommended,427910,29872426,Posted: 12 February,all,Jale,"I cannot recommend this game in its current state.Why?There are several reasons. First off, there is absolutely no story at all.Okay, so the game is designed to be a dungeon crawler, but in my opinion there should be at least some kind of story and questlines. Now the quests are kill number X of enemy type Y, and the same ""quests"" pop up at the list all the time.While I like the simple turn-based combat system, the game lacks enemies. ""Okay, I killed a level 8 Goblin. Again."" -- Next floor. ""Okay, I killed a level 9 Goblin. Again"" .. So basically you're fighting the same damn enemies every floor, that simply get a level increase every floor. It gets extremely boring, extremely fast. This is absolutely horrid. The game isn't in early access anymore.Okay, so you create a party of four (4) characters in the beginning, like many other RPGs. You get four classes, that's fine. But oh, you unlock new classes AFTER you finish some floors? On paper this sounds nice.However, the implementation is awful. You cannot make any more characters after the start. So how can you get the new classes? Starting a new game? ... NO. You have to buy them from the Tavern. Still sounds ok?Well, the thing is.. the characters in the Tavern are randomized. So, if you want the new class.. you have to refresh the thing (which costs of course) and the damn button doesn't even always work! ... Well, if you don't want to pay, the only way to refresh the damn tavern is... PLAY FLOOR 1, return. Check if the class is there. No?PLAY FLOOR 1 AGAIN. Return. Class is there! Ok! .. Well, I wanted a female version and the race is wrong. So, no.PLAY FLOOR 1 AGAIN. Return.. class isn't there.. REPEAT. AGAIN. AGAIN. AGAIN. AGAIN.When you finally get the damn class you wanted, with the RACE you wanted and GENDER you wanted...You have played the first damn floor like a 100 times over. Fighting the same damn enemies, for a millimeter of XP bar.Niiiiice. So you get the point, every time you want a new character you have to do this. Every new class unlocked, you have to do this. It's absolute bullcrap. It's tedious, boring and so-oh repetitive.And the thing is, even if you manage to get the new class you wanted with the right setup --The new character is likely much much lower level than the rest of your party, that you started with.Ok, so what to do? Of course if you don't care, you can just take the low level with you and hope it doesn't die. (Yeah, and if a character dies, it loses its gear, plus you have to pay for resurrection.)But, if you want it to get to the same level as the rest of the party?You have to go SOLO PLAY.. you guessed it.. FLOOR 1, get the XP.. REPEAT. Then if the character gets strong enough, you can move up and keep soloing until its the same level as others. Seriously, more and more grinding the first levels of the game. Just to get a new character?So yeah, this game is horrible at its current state.I advise you to NOT buy it unless these things make a little more sense.Even on sale this feels like a ripoff."

There are good ideas here, and it's possible to have some casual fun.  But it's seriously lacking in polish.The graphics are serviceable.  It's a game that doesn't need a lot of flashy looks for fun.  But it's also a rather bland art style.  Some sort of more unique and interesting style to the art and the game would help.I do like the option of accepting quests (though they seem very limited currently, like 'kill 5 imps next trip'), and of returning to the town to recover and try some upgrading.  It does end up with a rather grindy feel, though, even with being able to choose to re-enter at levels other than 1 every time.  And venturing in to the ever-changing tower has quite a bit of appeal for exploring, even if it seems fairly limited so far.Inside the tower you only run in to enemies when opening new rooms.  You never know what's behind the door, a tough or easy fight or something else.  You also won't know how much health and mana you've recovered until you step in to a fight, and can't do any preparation outside of combat.  No potions are involved.Misspellings are not rare.  Character generation, you get to create 4 out of a potential party of six, is very limited.  A very limited number of headshots.  Species doesn't make much obvious difference and there's very little information.  The only time armor rating for characters can be found is when entering the tower, for instance, and limits on what a class can equip aren't shown...you only find out when trying to equip.  There's very little or no explanation about how most of the mechanics function.There also appears to be some bug(s).  Some of the level 5 traits aren't available to select despite appearing to meet the criteria.  Locked doors you can find keys as loot on enemies, but I've yet to find how one is supposed to open blocked doors.To sum up, I'd say that Darkest Dungeon does most everything Zavix Tower does, but far better.  It just has that much darker theme.  Zavix looks more like traditional D&D style adventuring, but the execution still needs a lot of work."

Binding of issac, a 5 buck flash game, has better use of procedual than this game.-0 npcs and 0 story despite having a town you can go back to."

,Not Recommended,427910,25431447,"Posted: 9 September, 2016",all,jayxan,"I'm going to leave this here -The game is okay, But it is not an overwhelmingly positive game.Its more of an arena game than a dungeon crawler. . The game goes:Enter dungeon, clear some various rooms some containing monsters some not. Occasional Chest. And about 1 lever a floor. There is not much in the way of exploration, or interesting things to do. Its just a grind game. If you dont mind that (Which I dont) then it might be up your alley. But to call this a throw back to old school style dungeon crawlers is an unsult to old school dungeon crawlers.Every floor is nearly identical, go to 9ish rooms. No maze, no real traps, no puzzles, barely interesting enemies. The town's upgrade system is incredibly lacking as well. It also has a premium currency that they decided not to run with it seems but its still just as uncommon as if they charged for it.All and all, its an average game for the money. I wouldnt recommend it. Not because its terrible but because there are much better dungeon crawlers out there that you could play. Like might and magic X or Legend of Grimrock 1, or 2."

Turn-based combat with a variety of classes, specs paths and abilities keeps combat interesting and RPG need to get just 1 more level.Technical aspect is good, the game software is stable and bug free. In the 4 hours of play the only bug I encountered was a UI one in town, where only your first 4 characters inventories show up at the blacksmith. This is very minor and as no game play impact."

I also want to state i have no clue what your game design or platform is capable of etc i am just a game player not a maker.Alot more classes preferably  Bard/Archer/Monk/unholyknight If it is possible  to multiclass that would be incredible and extend the replayability and character building experience greatly.A few more race options or the ability to create your own from a template with the set parameters you deem as balanced.again this is purely to extend the replay and custom toon experience.Consider also for a expansion idea the use of Outdoor maps the same way you use indoor (again reference something like might and magic  circa sega genesis.) Again this is simply to increase replay value and give you more creative room to use new monsters.It is easy for me to sit back and say what i would like to see or what i Think should be there but i simply do not  know what you are actually able to put into the game.For what i purchased i am very happy and i feel it was one of my better purchases.I hope you Keep working on this for a long time  because it does  have a good feel and vibe  to it and would love to see the potential come to fruit. Thank you for the time spent reading this and please msg me with any questions or further  constructive input/feedback,"

You grind, get loot, level up, get stats, grind more. It's very easy to get into that ""just-one-more-room"" flow. I'm actually quite amazed that I've spend 12h on it. Why not recommend it? First of all the pricetag is quite high for what you get. The buildings look quite nice, but they don't do anything exciting. The classes are all quite bland and have limited powers and talents which again are quite uninteresting. The graphics ditto. The loot is very RNG, in both drop and stats (think diablo3). The UI could use some work. For instance the battle text is nigh unreadable and some powers are not displayed very well. Leaving you to wonder if you clicked the right button. You'll soon find yourself thinking: Is this all there is? The answer my friend, is yes. A core like this will always be strangely compelling but I can't help thinking there will be better games build around the same concept. Afterall the core is probably older than half of the steam users  :)"

Just wanted to buy a really good, fun indie game.)Jheesus, this game is a trainwreck. Doesn't support 1280x1024 monitors, GUI scales better to modern monitors,  is only readable(maybe) on a 1920x1080 monitor, but that could be overlooked if the game were fun.  This game is not fun, unfortunately. No offense of course, I __wanted__ to be surprised by an excellent product and while it was downloading I already planned to write a praising review, that I bought a good game based on ""Very Positive""  reviews on Steam, I wanted to be happy for the developer, but ALAS: its impossible, when the whole product is mediocre.Pros:+ Dungeon graphics is okay.+ Some monsters are funny: wolf+ Big main attribute fontsCons:- Item icons are too small - most of the GUI is badly proportioned -- tooltip font is small, out of proportion compared to its own window size. Look at the Diablo 1 fonts and window proportions.- item description texts are very small: comparing items strains the eyes.- There is a large picture depicting a chest and tiny item icons for loot? Come on, man! At least learn proportions or hire somebody, who understands GUI graphics.- the music is bad. Okay, I understand.- GUI is simply bad: icons should be 3x size along with the text (the devil is in the details, for some of us, you know)- character portraits are ridiculously small: as are their tiny skill icons- City (area) with stores, etc.. is mediocre work. The TABS identifying the buildings are wrongly colored and small, color scheme is weakly chosen, overall City has a mediocre art direction.- enemy spell animations are horrible: come on man, hire a particle effect artist!- Humanoid monster models are ugly, made by an unskilled employee- gold is scattered around in some rooms, but party cannot gather it up. :)- Sound effects are bad, almost disturbing to listen to- Graphics is haphazardly done without much skill, probably the better looking walls and doors were purchased or made by someone else or just the artist has environment skills mostly?- Now I can understand the so many and relatively frequent updates: mediocre art and weak design is easy to update, it doesn't really costs too much energy to deliver low level work week by week.Not recommended. This game is unfixable, too many bad decisions were made by the developer and fixing them would require a new game to be made. :)Result: Asking for a refund."

Okay, I thought, let's go setup letterbox! But, no, it's not gonna work - this game WILL upscale ugly no matter what you try.Sound levels are also weird and music is repetitive.Next, we start playing the game, and what do we see? It looks extremely cheap, UI feels clumsy and overall it makes my eyes sore. And I mean it - I'm okay with pixelart games, I'm okay with ""8bit"" kind of games but I'm not okay with this (maybe ♥♥♥♥♥♥ upscaling has to do with this, I don't know). Not to mention that interiors look bad and all anymations are not that great as well.Next, game doesn't use your usual shortcuts (""B"" for ""Bags"" instead of ""I"" for ""Inventory""? Why?), and it doesn't even have your usual movement layout (AD for strafes instead of QE? Why?).It feels like some very early alpha and not finished product. Or a product made by someone severely lacking skills to do so."
