The production quality, art, and way the novel is presented is actually okay, which makes me even madder that the plot had to be something as bad as what it was. You can finish it in under 2 hours, but I would not recommend playing it at all."

Sad thing about it has a promise of a story in it but doesn't deliver which is really sad. Instead it's just bunch with lewd and like I said very short story.

The person was trying to be interesting, the person was trying to be friendly and so on. But you just didn't get any useful information out of the conversation. Your head just remained empty.Reading this VN was a very similar experience. It has music, it has some worthy art, it has a proper GUI and it tries hard to be a VN. It has all the basic features that a VN should usually have. And yet it's still somehow ends up being empty. There is just nothing to make you feel emotional or to force you into thinking.I mean no disrespect, but... Sorry, this just doesn't fit my taste. However I would probably like it if they put more meaning into it.It feels almost like somebody tried out to make a VN for the first time, just to see how well it goes. But at the same time there was ZERO consideration of making any serious content. (And by seriousness I don't mean that it has to be unfunny. I mean that it needs to have some value.) So it ended up being shallow like a puddle.BTW WTF happends in the ""no secnd chance""-branch?

Aozora Meikyuu is not really a visual novel, it's a 45 minute description of constant making out and sex. My initial thought to a short visual novel was 2-4 hours of playtime, which must make this an INCREDIBLY, EXTREMELY short one. Kudos to the artist though, and the music wasn't awful."

This game is pretty short, I managed to beat it within an hour of play and I can recommend it to anyone who has not played, or doesn't want a long visual novel story to go through, just to make 10 minutes of progress on a 60+ hour story.The characters for Aozora Meikyuu are reminisant of your stereo-typical manga characters, guy who's a shut in, girl with a hidden past, and a person from the main character's past.  The story of all of these people is just enough to get the central plot of the game across without it dragging the story out for longwinded hours of the day.On the plus side of this game is the amount of time it takes to get through.  This game is considerably short, and can be beaten in well under 2 hours.  The story has a fair decent amount of pacing, and reminded me from time to time of reading a manga that came with it's own background music.  And the characters, while generic in their own right, bring their own liveliness to the game and makes you wonder more about them.Considering I don't have anything negative to say, the only downside that I could point at for this game is it's replayabiliy.  Once you get the main ending, you're basically replaying situations and scenes to just see what happens when you pick another option and how it affects the ending.Aozora Meikyuu as a whole is a pretty solid game and well worth the price I paid for it during the Steam Summer Sale 2016.  If you're trying to get yourself into Visual novels, or get friends who might be interested in them then I would highly recommend this game."

,Recommended,427980,25369043,"Posted: 5 September, 2016",all,«CG» Cromwell III,"Aozora Meikyuu is a short Romance Visual Novel by YumeCreations. It focuses on a relationship between a boy who dropped out of school after a failed love confession and a girl who falls from the sky.Just a little note: It will be difficult for me to write a review and explain this game without spoiling the end.Pros:Endings at different times- This was a well thought-out move to add in with visual novels (props to Yume).  Unlike other visual novels I have played, not all the endings happened at the end of the visual novel. You could potentially get an ending within 5 minutes of the visual novel. I also noticed that the more the story develops, the less options for endings you will get. It eventually comes down with 1 ending at the very end.CGs- Nothing I can say about this, CGs always make a visual novel better.Soundtrack- Love the soundtrackCon(s)Saving + Branching paths.- Sometimes, you cannot tell when you get the option to choose, and the fact that you can't save while choosing. Yeah, having a time limit while choosing the path is pretty unique, but at least inform the players that a branching path is coming up so they can save beforehand.Story-  The story was interesting, for sure. But the way it was written was really ""jumpy"". It starts on one part of the story, then skipping to a different part of the story within seconds. I'm not saying the story was bad, I just thought that it could use less story skips because the transition of the ""good ending"" was confusing at first.Yeah, I'd recommend this short and sweet visual novel if you're interested in romance. (heck, isn't all the visual novels about romance?)(Also, do people dislike this game just because they failed to pick the right choices to get to the good ending and they end up crying about it?)"

While still factoring in the minimal length of the VN, it was better than I expected. I thought after the first few minutes that it was going to be purely fanservice but it did actually manage to surprise me a couple of times. While there weren't many characters or locations, the artwork is quite nice and the writing flows well and is free of errors. That said, it feels a bit rushed to develop a relationship that quickly, even an entirely preposterous one like this. And there are a couple things that don't make sense after everything is revealed. Alternate endings are alarmingly abrupt.  But if you want a silly, feel good kind of story, you could do a lot worse than this."

The story is so anime that it makes me cringe every minute or so. I personally enjoyed it my first readthrough, but that's because everything about this VN is so ridiculous that I couldn't take it seriously. The only reedeming part about this VN would be the way it handled choices with a timer mechanic, which is something I would like to see other (better) VNs do or be inspired by. The entire ""best route"" can be read in 30 minutes, making it extremely short.If you like hot anime garbage, the kind that just makes others head turn and make people think you're a creep, then this VN is for you.

And that's aight. it's a standard male romance fanatsy at a cheap price in which you intially scorn your musume b/c plot until you inevitably bed her. If you've been drinking too much of Hiyao Miyazaki's kool aid and can't handle dem overused tropes then this ain't for you. But this game genuninely struck a cord in my colesterol filled arteries. The romance felt sweet and enjoyable. Sometimes ya need to take a step back from the cynicism and just enjoy the simpler daikimakuras of life. For what it's worth it's a good deal with an ending that was kinda suprising. This game is like a good snack. You're gonna enjoy it, it's quick to finish, but you aint gonna write home to momma bout it. But hey thats alright. If you got some spare cash and wanna nice, quick little romance whynaut neglect dem starving children in africa and pick this up? You might feel just a tiny fraction embiggened emotionally as a result"

76561198162703817,Recommended,427980,23513749,"Posted: 11 June, 2016",all,aim4thetop1,"It's not perfect.There are much better visual novels out there, like Corpse Party or Steins;Gate, and while I wouldn't say the writing is bad, it's not good either. The beginning of Aozora Meikyuu reminds me of Club Life, in that past events are why the protagonist has a conflict with women, except it's actually explained a bit here. Aoi becomes a shut-in Otaku, until wandering outside to buy one of his eroge/dating sim games, where he then meets his love interest, Sora.Unlike a true perverted Otaku, rather than actually embrace her suggestive thoughts and actions towards him, his past keeps him from accepting her advances. The two go back and forth throughout the hour spent playing this game, with Sora continuing to be clingy and have a huge appetite, while Aoi finds her annoying.But here's where my bias of my recommendation comes in. As a fellow Ren'py user who's also in the process of making a visual novel, the writing style in this game was a lesson to learn from. Other than grammar issues and sentences not flowing properly, perhaps because of translations, I can't say the way it was written was bad.My disappointment however, comes from the way the story was paced. Things could have been a lot longer if some stuff like playing games with Sora, hadn't just been summarized. It's been awhile since I've played/watched a playthrough of Corpse Party/Steins;Gate, but I'm pretty confident that both visual novels are dialogue heavy, which can be both a good and bad thing, depending on how the story is written. And this game could have used that kind of pacing.There's also how Sora is the only girl you can really romance, and how even though the option to ditch her for a past crush happens twice, the game just returns to the title screen after choosing it. Making another route for that really wouldn't have been that difficult. Just a couple of label starts and scene transitions to come up with an ending. It wouldn't be much of one, but it's better than the tease mentioned after meeting this crush, and not explaining it when you stay.Because of that, I really would have felt better if the game had been sold for $2.99, instead of $4.99. I'm not one to refund games, since I'm pretty careful with my purchases, so I'll be keeping this in my library as a reference.And to be honest, the nudity tag was the main reason I bought it. If there had simply been more scenes, then the $4.99 would have actually been worth it. But since that wasn't what happened, anyone who decides to buy this game, should keep in mind that the developer could have really polished the game a bit more."
,Recommended,427980,23703058,"Posted: 22 June, 2016",all,xCyberWolfx0553,Not a bad story. The ending was unexpected and hit like a ton of bricks. I would have liked to see a little more story but i can't expect much for the ammount i paid.
,Recommended,427980,23744011,"Posted: 23 June, 2016",all,Sinhwaui,"The game is short, between the different endings and some idle I ended up with 3,5 hours.But talking about the game itself, the Visual novel is pretty interesting since I can relate a lot to Aoi (main character) who just finds a cute girl dropping from the sky and naked called Sora and then they start living together, both with secrets which they don't feel like sharing at the beginning.The art, music and plot are pretty decent but the only down side I can really see it's how short it is.But I recommend this to anyone although the creater  needs to make something bigger because this is actually good, all it needs right now it's a small update with new achievements.Just don't expect a master piece from a cheap and single person made game."
,Recommended,427980,23810805,"Posted: 25 June, 2016",all,MichDem,"This is a very, very short VN, especially compared to... well anything else. Under 2 hours of gameplay you can explore every ending this game has.That being said it's very engagind and the game focuses only on the romance. There is little backstory or anything of that sort. And that can be a good thing, because it goes directly to your emotional side. And I must say that after playing this game I do feel satisfied.The main ending is quite suprising and unexpected. Other endings are in a way just there. That is a pity given that I personally would like to explore them knowing the outcome of the main one.Game has a path to unlock mature content. There is nothing hardcore like in Sunrider Academy, but it's still a plus.TL;DR version:Even thou this game is short I recomend it. The feeling you get while playing it is wort the price (especially during sales)"

Thankfully, it didn't turn out to be a sour experience.The artwork is simple and with regards to choices, there is the option of not picking a choice whcih can lead to different results. I was mildly surprised to see my choices leading to ending the game within the first 2 choices! Though with  the slightly predictable plot twistof the main character being dead for quite some timeyou do get interesting endings.I will admit this - I never expected Sorato be a bit like Gasai Yuno with the kitchen knife in handfor the Sora bad ending.Total - 8/10. - Playable? Yes - Worth money spent? Probably, but didn't delve on it too much."

I'll give it a thumbs up because it wasn't terrible and I did complete it (and was interested enough to actively find the other endings), but read the rest of the review to figure out if you should get it.It was a very short story (I have 1 hour played, and that covered all the endings that you can get), and the story and interactions are very very basic.  I suppose it was a kind of fun read, and it has some lewd content (sex is talked about and assumed, but even the H-patch doesn't add any content: it just 'uncensors' the existing CG), which may or may not be what you are looking for.  No deep story or 'feels' really (although there was kind of an interesting twist at the end, and the 'bad' ending did creep me out a bit, I guess that's something).  Nothing really particularly clever either.  I wouldn't say the hour playing was completely wasted, but....I'm seeing a $5 price tag, and I'm going to say that's too much to pay for this: if it goes on sale (I think I got this as part of a bundle myself, or the summer sale dropped it down, one of the two), then I'd say give it a try if you are looking for something short and not involved... at ALL.  Otherwise, go for something else (most free ones seem to be better than this actually, now that I think about it)."
