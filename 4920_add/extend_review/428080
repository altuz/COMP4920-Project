I have no need to play multiplayer, I play games to get away from humanity, not to interact with it.  Graphics are great, haptic feedback is lifelike.  Polished all around.  Highly recommended.  Worth paying full price."

It is competitive, online play is amazing and the game is such an enjoyable spin on racket sports.The graphics are perfect, gameplay is smooth and presentation is slick. It blows my mind that a AAA Studio did not make this game. Its just so polished.Do yourself a favor and buy this right now!"

,Recommended,428080,29877751,Posted: 12 February,all,plgod,"I feel like VR has a lot of people writing their first Steam review. Well it's my turn now.As VR users know, most content right now relies on the ""WOW!"" factor to be appealing, and games that are still actually fun once the VR magic fades are few and far in between. Racket: Nx is one of the only VR games I played (my VR collection has ~40 games) that is genuinely fun.IMO, this is largely due to the ""power shot"" mechanics. By hitting the ball hard, it is possible to hit many tiles in a line, while the direction of that line depends on the shot's angle and spin. The concept is simple, but being able to hit hard while controlling both aim and spin requires a lot of practice. Very few VR games require any skill from the player, but this element of skill/mastery is what makes most games fun: sports, FPS, RTS, they all get more fun as you play and become better at them.However, because of that, it might not suit everyone's taste. Fortunately there's a demo, so you can see exactly what the game is like. You get more game modes (including multiplayer) in the full game, but you won't need that to see whether you like the game or not.Definitely do try out the demo, this game is what I'm expecting from VR in the next few years."

Very good for those who have a small space ... as you stand in a 360 arena hitting the ball at hexagonal blocks, and the player movement, other than the paddling, is just turning - you will learn to step over your VR cord pretty easily."

I have about forty games and I think this one is an absolute masterpiece.  There are many types of experiences in VR you can have, but  If you like games that require sporty action, beautiful visuals, and well designed audio then this is a great one.  It doesn't appear to be a starter game.  With the latest update it feels like a complete forward-thinking style game that will help lead us into what should be expected from VR in the future.  It’s like racquet ball, tennis and Tron all smashed together.  FANTASTIC GAME.  If the scale was 1-100 for game rating I would give it a 100."

This game is one of the game that makes me want to come back for more from time to time. This game also showcase how VR can enhance the gaming experience rather than just a novelty.

The graphics, sounds, arena, and gameplay draws you into the amazing experince that screenshots and video cannot show. I would highly recommend checking out the demo to see how you like it. But speaking about the demo, it has one feature that is not in this version of the game; one which it should. That feature is a local leader board. I personally like to challenge myself to fill up the leader board with scores above a certian point, plus it is really cool to see your increasing scores. There is also something about entering in my three initals which is extreamly satisfying to me.Please bring back local leader boards!!It is a simple feature that you all ready have in the demo!"

The physic feels realistic, haptic of the racket is very nice. The 360° sound is awsesome. The developers got an one year plan with updates to bring the game out. Hoperfully they can manage to reach those goals.This game has a lot of potential."

It's a fantastic achievement from the combined efforts of HTC and the dev team on this game.Really have to congrat the dev team on this effort, the physics are great and the game looks fantastic.

Clearly these developers have a vision for this game and the chops to execute. Lots of impactful additions beyond what I expected i.e. adding content.They made significant additions to the mechanics in the levels themselves as well as huge UI additions, massive addition of cumulative stats (!) and ranking (!).From day 1 this was one of the best VR games around, and they just made huge additions. This game is great. Get it."

Tell that my now completely destroyed but completely ripped right arm. I'm in constant battle between my screaminly aching arm muscles and my want to keep playing this game. The progression of fun goes like this. When you figure out the goal of the game, it's mildly fun. Oh, I can curve the ball by putting a top/bottom spin on it? Cool. Oh what? If I hit it with enough power, the ball will ride along the walls, making it easier to hit targets? Awesome! OH @#%^ MULTIPLAYER?! Highly recommend this game."

I'm rather glad that devs of Racket: Nx decided to offer a free demo. After playing that for a few minutes it became clear that yes, I do need another raquet game.The level of polish in this game is stunning. The game is beautiful, the sound is crisp, the game is fun in both single and multiplayer with quite an extensive road map. I'm glad to support the devs that clearly know what they're doing.

After hitting her hand rather hard on the office desk and thinking nothing of it she continued to play. By the time i walked into the room it looked like a murder scene with blood splattered all over the walls, ceiling, carpet and pc.This game is awesome!!!I have a 2m x 2m space which is just enough (learn to flick your wrists rather than use your whole body to swing). A truly satisfying game that keeps me coming back for more. Each hit of the ball delivers a super satisfying 'boom' and the music gets you pumped to keep going.If your are in doubt about purchasing this, try the free demo (more games should offer this).EDIT: The unwind feature that allows you to untangle your headset at the end of each round is simple but AWESOME!! All other developers take note. This simple but highly effective feature will save headset cable damage and tangles, well done!"

I really want more people to play the multiplayer so please buy this! Solid mechanics that are simple yet hard to master.

That’s the vibe I got.So I load up the demo training level and start to play.After about 30 – 45 seconds of playing I suddenly stopped, quit the game and went and immediately purchased the full version! ITS THAT GOOD LOLThis game is as near as perfect for a Vive right now as any I have so far experienced. I think the learning curve is really nice and gentle and I think the gameplay is simply wonderful.I think this is by far the most value for money and fun VR product I have yet come across and I cannot thank the devs enough for their vision, passion and talent to make such an awesome VR game!Hats off to all those guys and gals who are working on this and the VR community that must have helped shape the game into what it is right now… and to think it can only get better and better!To any who might be in doubt just download the demo, what have you got to lose lol and for the rest, just buy it, it really is great!Peace"
76561198055762608,Recommended,428080,29634173,Posted: 1 February,all,Ortzz,"Racket:Nx feels like a sport that would be popular in the tron universe. It is an tennis like game that puts you in an arena with glowing hexagons you need to hit with a crazy, kinetic, alternate gravity ball. For a VR early access title, it is already super polished. The ball and racket physics feel pretty much perfect (I am not good enough at the game yet to verify this accuratley, but it feels fair for the most part) and the graphics are actually quite nice! It is a pretty simple game, but as polished as job simulator.Play the demo. It show you everything you need to know about the game and probably could be a pretty good tool for showing others VR all on its own. But the full game has many more tricks up its sleeve, and multiplayer if you are into that kind of thing.FYI RIFT OWNERS: It works if you have the touch and a 360 setup. It will require a bit of room to play this thing, so make as much space as you can!"

The sleek aesthetic and crisp audio provide great feedback. As a tennis player, the feel of the racket and how the ball moves feel strangely perfect. I can definitely see a huge amount of room for mastering dexterity in the game.The biggest downside is that it’s really just a skill based arcade game.

I wasn't completely convinced by the limited demo, but the promo price dropping 4 quid off the price tag gave me that nudge to give this a crack (could always refund after all). This wasn't in the Steam sale so I was disapointed at the time.On the whole I'm quite the fan of bat and ball VR games, I have a bunch on them including ping pong, tennis, wall breaking, and others inbetween. Some are good and some just look good without much substance. Racket: Nx both looks good and the gameplay is amazing. The ball control is very intuititve. I'm still learning the ropes but after a short time my acuaracy is improving. There maybe some subtle auto-aim aid going on, I'm not totally sure. Either way that doesn't matter the incredible action is engrossing. On top of this this is an excellent fitness VR game.On reflection the full asking price is more than fair, but I'm pretty stoked on the discount and getting such a good game to boot. I already know I'll be spending many hours playing this, so much fun and so well made."

While playing table tennis in VR is nice, this one really gives the feeling of playing tennis in a large arena and trying to beat the level is a really good workout. However the game reminds you of taking care of your suroundings not just for fun: You need a large play area and while playing you definitively forget where you are and where you stand so make sure you don't smash you controller into your furniture. As a nice feature, on the floor the game shows how much you spun the Vive's cable around you and thus allows to untwist the cable without leaving VR!"

Hard to get right, but nice points when you do. Awesome.A shining example of what this new tech can deliver."
,Recommended,428080,30632527,Posted: 20 March,all,Neosage,"For a VR game based on a simple premise, I was afraid Racket:NX won't deliver in the long run like the countless 'A class' VR games I possess that either fall short or has promised to provide out of EA. Like many of you hesitant to buy a true esport game due to EA as well as spending money on something with low replayability value thus cringing your money short.Truth be told, at the beginning, I almost believed that was true but even in EA one, Racket:NX shines its magnificent primier of what TRUE ESPORTS can do for you. True Esports is one without seating, where your arena is room scale and you sweat and grind for glory, PHYSICALLY. (On  the one hand, being a fan of esports, I cringe the day MOBAs die off being replaced by VR competitive sports but boy am I glad VR took a healthy active turn for the better)Racket NX feels bland at first and as though the racket, ball, and shiny glowy things are just for show and you keep hitting it like its a toy. Your shots are going wide, your wondering whether your controller is ♥♥♥♥ed or development was stupid. Then, you start noticing sounds coming from different locations and your headphones actually can produce surround quality effects. You realise the ball itself emits a sound and so do the wormholes to indicate where the ball is coming from. After you score some finished sets, you begin to realise you are actually getting better not through mental training but literally both mental and physical training. The ball no longer feels like a toy, it becomes heavy and every location it is in VR IS EXTREMELY VITAL INFORMATION.Your shots start being accurate for once and you realize what happens when you hit the ball too early or too late because even that minute detail...MATTERS. Suddenly you got angry and saw a confident shot, you BLAM the ball in the best position and you realize the white smash speed trail that runs across the wall gaining you multiple hits. Before long, the smash starts becoming a spin. Yes...racket NX turned Tennis, Table, Tennis, Squash and Badminton sideways and puked on all of them by giving players the ability to SPIN!!Summary:Seeing a curving smashed ball clearing a score plate finishing a set? Priceless. What I'm trying to get at is the game's ability to play with physical elements of your body, essentially 'upgrading' your character manually...through YOU, physically, like natural sports. You actually progress through the game by actually being better, physically, no need for ultimates, abilities or mana, your stamina IS YOUR MANA. The cream on top for an esport EA 1? Multiplayer sets! where they essentially took the table tennis, squash doubles play and slam it in this high action impact sports but unlike any sport (since there is no dome arena except in cycling), you can 'snooker' your enemy by giving him a hard ball in the cleared section, which means you need to learn reverse racketing as well.There are many things that you will learn to do while playing this game, and you will never stop learning based on the game's ability to instill natural guides, that is your senses, into every playmaker move you make and that answers its replayability value. The game will make you learn more, its only natural and you will improve no matter how bad you are, that is another reason why I recommend this game as its progression is based on you and it will show you how naturally, you will know how you improve because the reward is instant the moment you feel the haptic feedback as the slow mo edge of your racket swings into vision and that aced smash ball zoning into that score plate breaking the glass of the dome, finishing the set.Good luck to you all racketeers10/10 would have a heart attack again flinging my touch into space for that sweet shot"

This can trigger height-fear issues for a number of folks even though it's space and even though it's not real.  An option to have an extended floor would help a lot of folks.  The competition dome shuts that issue off immediately so good for that.  One of my pet peeves is that so many games have ""cool"" settings with massive height vistas that look awesome but don't take into account that many folks are afraid of heights or have fear of flying (obviously, not an issue for this game but it's my peeve).  I know some folks get triggered into their height fear by that small disc platform at the end of a game or in the menu which is too bad as the game is awesome and they don't need to have that response (hint, it helps a bit by not looking down but looking forward until the dome comes up but one can get hit unawares).I think this is a wonderful game."

If you also enjoyed the demo then you'll be glad to hear that nothing fundamental has changed now that it has entered Early Access.The physics feel natural and everything runs smoothly.  I've noticed one bug when trying to select a rematch in multiplayer but other than that the game's very well put together, this isn't an Early Access game that has only been in development for a couple of weeks and I'd be happy if this were the finished product.The graphics are nicely done and you get in-game options to increase anti-aliasing and supersampling.  I tried upping the SS but I felt the improvements weren't that noticeable (unlike a game like Raw Data where SS really makes a difference) and I thought it introduced a bit of lag (Nvidia 970).  I may have been imagining the lag but for this type of game where you need fast reactions it's not worth it just so that the already clear, polished graphics look a little bit prettier.I've had my Vive since June/July and this is the first and only game I've played against others in multiplayer!

Audio plays a huge part in perceiving what is happening in the game. There are a couple of bugs such as the ball which occasionally gets stuck to a wall, or a ball you can't hit at the start of the game which the developers are aware of and I'm sure are already working to fix.

,Recommended,428080,29978902,Posted: 16 February,all,Scruzzer,"Fracture on Arcade Saga is a fan favorite at my place. This looked similar so I picked it up and I enjoy this much more than I thought I would. It's more challenging than I thought, but after a few attempts I was finding it more and more rewarding. While Fracture has an arcade feel to it, Racket is a bit more polished with a modern tech feel. One thing I like about Racket is the need for only one controller. I find it useful to keep my free hand on the cable behind me in order to keep my bearings.Once you get down the basics, you'll notice that you can apply a good amount of spin on the ball for some really cool curve shots or shots that travel along the walls hitting multiple tiles. There's an announcer present to keep you informed and to compliment you on exceptional shots. 360 degree sound is your friend in this game. Listening can tell you which direction to go when you can't see your target.So I decided to go into multiplayer. That's where the magic happens. SO fun! You're competing against someone who looks like a bot. Wave hello! You take turns hitting the same ball. It changes color when it's your turn to hit it. It almost has a co-op sort of feel to it. I was only able to play one game, so please add to the player pool. :)Be extra cautious of your boundaries. I had a couple of collisions and I play in a good size area.tl;dr: Very polished, high tech racket sports game that rewards skillful play. Very fun multiplayer.

76561198020700030,Recommended,428080,33890438,Posted: 29 July,all,Dis,"Hitting the ball is satisfying and it feels like it goes where it should. The game looks great, and has a clean UI and menus. What I don't care for however is the execution (not the idea) of the energy system. Most of the times where I find myself able to line up a bunch of energy I'm already at 100%. I really don't like how the skulls (negative energy) are placed in areas were goals arn't. I don't feel I should have to worry about hitting bad spots while just repositioning the ball. I feel empty areas should be... welll empty. I feel like I'm hitting more plus signs that skulls but I just hit the skulls at bad times. If I get low on energy, I find myself dying just trying to reposition the ball because it hits some random skull I didn't even see. That is another thing. FoV is pretty low in VR, and this is the kind of game where that REALLY hurts you. The game also requires you to spin a lot which makes the cord wrap around my legs. The cord combined with FoV issues really exacerbate the problem I have with skulls being placed in open random areas because the ball often strikes them when I'm trying to untangle myself or reposition the ball by using open walls that I don't have a good visual on. In other words... it feels very bad to lose. It feels like I got unlucky rather than me messing up.My proposal would be to not have skulls in open areas and to increase the power of the pull back mechanic that uses energy. It would make it a better tool for repositioning the ball, and it would allow you to pull it away from skulls.I'm sorry if my thoughts seem a bit scattered, but I'd like to list more positives. The portals are a great mechanic for repositioning which is the area I think the game needs the most work. I would like to have a better tell of where the balls are comming out though. Maybe the exit portal could light up so you can find it faster while turning around (this would help alleviate FoV visiability issues). Another great thing is the rolling mechanic. I absolutely love it, and it adds a whole layer of depth to the game. It is very creative. I think it can be improved though. Currently, if I hit the ball medium hard it has just as much speed as if I did if I hit it extremely hard. I'd like to see the ball's cap for speed raised. I want to be able to take a risk by hitting the ball very hard. I'm not sure if this is a technological limitation or an intentional limitation, but it feels jarring to me that there isn't a different between hitting the ball twice as hard once it reaches a certain point.I'd like to thank the devs for working on a game like this for VR. This is the perfect kind of game for VR as it is now.It is something that could only be done in VR.It takes a familiar feel of real life sports and takes the fantasy to the next level.It isn't overly ambitious for its medium (too many games feel like tech demos rather than games because they try to make games that are heavily hindered by VRs limitations and end up feeling incomplete)The VR scene would be far far better if more developers had the vision of Racket NX rather than trying to copy normal AAA titles in ways that make games feel more like the husk of something else. I look forward to see the develpment progress in this game more than most, and I'd love to see it suceed so more VR developers will understand what makes for a good VR game."

I quote game only because most other options call themselves games but in reality their nothing more than experiences; they have very little if any replay value.Pros:+Amazing Tracking+Realistic Physics+Ability to Apply Spin+Unique Player RepresentationCons:-Occasional Game Ending Bug (I.E Ball Stuck in Wall)-(Alpha 1) Really only one Gamemode-(Alpha 1) No Customization of Player or Levels"
,Recommended,428080,29883136,Posted: 12 February,all,CameronS,"Absolutely fantastic game, my current favorite out of almost 50 VR titles. The graphics are very polished, and there is incredible 360 degree sound that really adds to the game a lot. The actual gameplay is the best part though, the ball and racket physics feel very realistic and respond the way you would expect them to. There are currently 4 solo sets, the last of which has only been beaten by about 10 people so there is definitely an element of challenge to this game. There is also an arcade mode which just goes on infinitely until you run out of time due to missing too much, and then finally an awesome multiplayer mode. All of these features will be expanded on greatly in the future as it is EA so its a great deal for an amazing game. God i sound like im getting paid but i just love this game and want more people to get to play it because its a blast."

It really does feel like a finished game already, even though it has a lot of features that are ""coming soon.""Things I would like to see implemented however:-Option to mute the commentator (it really annoys me)-Option to mute microphone in multiplayer"
,Recommended,428080,29613042,Posted: 31 January,all,curio,"Extremely polished tennis-/squash-inspired game that not only nails the graphics but also the physics (in contrast to other games such as #SelfieTennis where the ball goes through the racket all the time). Compared to the previously available demo, the first EA release has gained multiplayer and a variety of single-player modes. The game also has (equally nicely done) settings that can be used to really ramp up the graphics quality (AA and supersampling), even though it looks really good compared to some other games even at default settings. Highly recommended!"

Think again, this game is awesome!  Best of the racket games available, this is like Holoball 3.0 with excellent multiplayer!  Can't wait till they have ranked multiplayer also.  A must have if you have ever enjoyed a racket game (real or virtual) in your life."
,Recommended,428080,29612386,Posted: 31 January,all,leppermessiah,I played about 20 minutes of the endless arcade mode.  Good fun and definitely offers something different than Holoball or Cyberpong.  There's a lot more playability here beyond what's offered in the demo.  I use the HTC Vive for cardio and I will definitely be adding this amongst the ranks as a light-moderate intensity exervive game.

,Not Recommended,428080,30281904,Posted: 2 March,all,cubedparadox,"I wanted to like this game, but after playing for a bit I just couldn't get into it. Low intensity medium skill gameplay with a harsh starting skill curve until you learn how to play. Multiplayer felt cludged in and didn't really seem interesting at all. I expected a fast paced challenging game, but I got a game where your hits are fairly slow and dull when playing well, and missing meant waiting for the ball to come your way again. I feel like the game would have been better if there was less of a focus on 360 play, and the devs instead worked on making getting hits as fast and satisfying as possible."

It's a hell of a workout too, on rainy days I just play Racket: NX for an hour instead of biking riding or the gym. I've had some great experiences in multiplayer too. But recently whenever I choose multiplayer the game searches endlessly for another player and never finds one for me. Maybe they have changed something because it use to work for me in the old version. Besides that, I have no complaints about this game and highly recommend you try it out."
