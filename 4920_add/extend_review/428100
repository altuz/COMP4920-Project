,Recommended,428100,24761117,"Posted: 7 August, 2016",all,Faudraline,"At this point we all know Aldorlea Games to be an RPGMaker games publisher with some quality and expectation stored for us. Being EternalShadow Studios' first and only game developed so far,Beyond Realityis a JRPG done right - within the boundaries of RPGMaker nonetheless. This is a short, story driven game with a beautiful setting and an immersive storyline.In this technologically advanced little world, the primary problem is the pollution that has already taken an effect over the climate and rendered a major part of the world uninhabitable. As humanity developed, it also consumed and processed natural resources to a degree that mother earth would eventually give up. While bizarre climate changes worry most of the scientist population drastically, Alpha Omega Company researches the causes and consequences of this natural detriment. The day starts as a usual one in the company headquarters... at least until they receive a visitor from the past, demanding aid from the company crew to prevent a war that may very well spell catastrophe for their timeline! So - a bit involuntarily - the crew is snatched from their proper timeline to change the past; thus, maybe achieving a featBeyond Reality: changing their own future...The environmentalist message aside,Beyond Realityis a Fantasy JRPG, in which you'll travel into a medieval fantasy world fuelled with magic to manage your party and venture into adventure to discover a conspiracy that would alter the timeline. Story is interesting, but it is genuinely short to speak about a proper world lore. We are given the basics of the geography, the history and the political conflicts since they all are our primary topics, yet we are not given much narrative. Our characters though - not incredibly memorable maybe - are given enough personality to differentiate and enjoy their interactions on the way.The main story is pretty much a railroad with decent destination indicators given, and there are some side quests and areas to explore - mostly with a ""go there and kill that boss for me"" quest content. Even though not being incredibly deep or anything, the game doesn't outstay its welcome. It presents you an enjoyable 10-12 hours, and you get done with it with a pleasant smile on the face.If we are to speak about environment design, it is surely one of the better examples for the usage of RPGMaker. Maps are designed appropriately, with a decent selection from custom pack items and tiles, resulting in a genuinely enjoyable collage. Soundtrack is fitting: not boring or annoying exactly, even though there'd be a 100th time you'd hear it, especially on the battle interface. It just blends in with the environment to become a part of the setting.As for the gameplay, it is really your basic JRPG. You walk around, explore the area and face head on some combats to gather experience. Characters have their different set of combat skills and it takes some expertise to arrange a party efficiently - especially while playing the game in expert or hard difficulties. Your characters are to be upgraded both by leveling up - there is a level cap of 10 - and proper gear so you can face tougher battles as they come. I think low level cap and limited gear options were proper choices for this game, considering its length in hours.There are achievements - and most of them work properly, yet there are some problems with the completion achievements such as ""Boss of All"" or ""Rare Defeat"" currently. Developer has been incredibly attentive to the community, offering his aid for every possible way with kind words, gameplay encouragement and hard work. They are working to correct these achievement bugs, so there is a better chance that this won't be an issue soon.If you feel like going through a short JRPG with a basic story that would take your mind off some casual problems, look no further.Beyond Realityis your game.Update: A patch came out to deal with the achievements issue. Now they all trigger properly. Good gaming!Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

I love how the story unfolds, and I'm constantly waiting to see what happens next.  This is so fun to play, and it's never boring in the slightest. I recommend this game to all RPG fans who love good stories with great art and music, fun characters, and easy to learn mechanics.  Right now this feels like an instant classic. I'm looking forward to see how it ends.Abilities are gained by experience, and there are no random battles. You have the freedom to avoid battles too, if you wish.There is some great, great music in this game!  Again, highly recommended!Definitely worth it especially at the affordable price."

You work for a company that is trying to fight against this pollution. You have discovered this strange crystal and are conducting experiments upon it. Suddenly, it breaks open, and a refugee from 2000 years before appears. She does... something and you end up in her time, having to help her with her issues.That's the set-up for Beyond Reality. It is an interesting concept, and the gameplay is fun. And you just might change the world."

It is hard to find a good rpg with mix of fantasy and rpg. This game does it.I do have one problem though...the game seems too short for a rpg. I am usually more used to longer rpg's, but that is my opinion, still , a decent game. I tried to help the developer fix some bugs i found in the game, so i hope that helps everyone in the future. Anyways, enjoy, for the price i got it at, it is not bad."
,Recommended,428100,31575038,Posted: 6 May,all,DOBERMAN AX,"An enjoyable RPG Maker project that has a rich story and some surprisingly colorful characters. Took about 10 hours to 100% complete, which will require the player to tackle the additional difficulties and hunt down some hidden enemies and items. The tilesets and level designs are pretty innovative compared to some other games of the same budget.I could see some players being turned off by the static battle animations, but the character portraits are gorgeous and handled with care, so it gives the game a nice ""retro"" feel. Dual attacks and strategic skills add a little more to a relatively simplistic system. The story offers a few twists and turns to keep you going, which for me is hard to find in games like these.If you are looking for something that won't break the bank and will offer an easy-going adventure, then I would definitely recommend this one."
,Recommended,428100,33051306,Posted: 30 June,all,Death By Yogurt,"Beyond Reality has an intriguing opening, but doesn't really do anything to impress from there.The story set up is cool:  an advanced civilization has ruined their world with pollution.  You play a female scientist trying to find a solution.  Sadly, this whole plot line really isn't developed that much from there.From there, it takes cues from Star Ocean and takes you from a sci-fi world to a fantasy one, where you will be spending most of the rest of the game.  Unfortunately, the plot involved in the fantasy world is pretty much by the books.Map design is subpar.  There weren't any tilesets I hadn't seen before, and they weren't used in any really interesting ways.  The maps aren't ugly, they're just uninspired.  There's also a few graphics issues, with halves of trees straight up missing and such.  Really just laziness.  Even monster sprites on the maps are just the same blue or red orbs.  The dungeons are pretty linear with a few puzzles sprinkled here and there.  It's serviceable.  Dungeons never felt too long or too confusing.The combat is standard RPG Maker stuff.  The layout looks like Phantasy Star which is kinda cool.  Unfortunately, the combat is very easy and strategy boils down to ""use your most powerful attacks and heal every so often.""  That's it.  That will beat every enemy in the game.  The hunts are cool and I completed them all, but, again, there's no strategy to beating any of them.The game took me 5 hours to beat, I got 20 of 24 achievements, and I beat the game with my characters at level 9.I've definitely played worse when it comes to RPG Maker, but there's nothing really to write home about here.  It's a shame the rest of the game fails to live up to its cool premise.  At least it's cheap."

Nostalgia really hit home as you wonder around in the retro-styled game. If you ever played Pokemon back in the days and enjoyed it, You will enjoy this just as much! So far I do not have anything to complain about except maybe the fact that a mouse is not used in this game. Took me awhile to realise that I had to use the arrow keys in the main menu to navigate it. Besides that, the storyline is very intriguing, and the music is wonderful! Really do enjoy this game!

76561198127686969,Recommended,428100,23599021,"Posted: 16 June, 2016",all,HausErdBeere,"This game was SO beautiful. It had a good story (one of the must-have features for a game - at least for me) and likeable characters, but what amazed me the most was the lovely scenery. Everything was designed with such love for detail which, together with the obviously carefully chosen music, added up to an atmosphere I was dragged into in a split second. And since I use the RPG Maker VX Ace myself, I perfectly know just how much work achieving this goal is.To the creators of 'Beyond Reality': you did a really great job there! And I think it's a pity this game is so short...Really, you're awesome."
,Recommended,428100,34404166,Posted: 21 August,all,YPRPG,"Beyond Reality is a 3 hour adventure RPG with a great story, challenging battles, and quite a few monsters to beat in side quests.The premise of the story is that you and a group of scientists work for an anti-pollution company, and are pulled back in time by a mage from an ancient government, who is trying to save the world from an evil force. You must work together to fight this evil, before being returned to your own time. The plot is very well told, and has a rich cast of characters, some of whom join your party. The game, however, is painfully short, given the broad scope and careful setup of the story.The world map is quite extensive, and can be explored for a number of monsters which can be killed as side quests. Prompting from the game's characters, however, strongly urges you along the main story sequence. There are a few, but not many, side quests that involve missions other than monster kills.Enemies are visible on the map, and most can avoided with some skill, but if you get too close, they will rush at you. Battles are sometimes difficult, and it is sometimes necessary to return to your safety zone for a rest after only one or two battles. At the start of the game, you have four party members, while towards the end you have 7 or 8, but must choose which four to use in battle. You are allowed to switch party members during battles, but this is rarely a strategic advantage.There are stores to buy weapons and armour, but unless you go for the side quests, your progress will go much too fast to equip all your characters with all the best stuff, and the game is easy enough to beat without it.Overall, it's a great game, but very short."
76561198214989148,Recommended,428100,29611570,Posted: 31 January,all,icc.jpciii,"This game is very much on the fence for me.  For RPGMaker titles there are some really good, and some really bad, this falls right on the other side of bearable.  It is not horrific, and it did make me smile and intrigued, but overall it felt a little empty.Warning, semi-spoilers aheadFirst off the characters themselves both due to the sheer number of playable characters, and people in the story not enough of them got enough characterization to stand water.  But the premise of the story was pretty good.  Very Chrono Trigger-ish but in reverse.  IE you are from the future something happened in the past, but you are forcibly sent back in time and some of your party members stay behind at the end causing the entire future to change from polluted, to clean.The combat is shallow, repetitive and leveling is a chore.  There is an achieve for all characters lv 10 which you will get at the final boss whether they are that lv or not.  Which is good since you get a lv 6/7 chara right before said boss.  Virtually any tactic early in the game will work late game.The villian feels as if there's no motivation behind him...  He feels shallow as well.  Sure villians aren't detailed much but most of the time good villians make GREAT stories.Sorry rant over  I wish there was a neutral option for this review."

VERY good storyline, fun characters, and you can eventually mix and match your party to suit your playing style. Final boss fight was actually tough (I died the first time, but was successful the second). Even if you only beat it once, it's still worth the price."

,Not Recommended,428100,20516232,"Posted: 13 January, 2016",all,IAmJakeSauvage,"I love the cover art/promotional material for this game, but man...*PROS*- Sleek GUI/Menu- Attention to detail (footprints, added effects, etc.)- Lovely mapping (for the most part)*CONS*- Poor story progression/character developmentEXPANSION: You're thrown into this game - and so many random things happen within the first 15 minutes you're going to have next to no clue what's going on. A bad dream with no relevance really, a girl in a crystal (where that came from I don't even  know), an S-Rank spell that transports you back in time and disingenuous reactions to that situation just made me go ""uh..."" - I mean, it just all seems so poorly fleshed out/cheesy. And why is the ""most powerful mage in the world"" far less powerful than your second recruited mage?- Dialogue needs some polishing.EXPANSION: It's not awful, don't get me wrong - but there's a lot of repetition and name-dropping which makes the dialogue rather boring at times. My advice to the dev is to implement some flavor text/exploration-based text throughout to strengthen the lore/situational awareness (like why Asha was in the crystal...that happened far too quickly).- Bugs. Mostly with passability (having to restart game because the guard won't move past you in Herador) - but I had a script error in battle that I wasn't able to replicate.- Boring battlesEXPANSION: The ""attack, get hit"" repetition goes on far too long in most battles - maybe they get better as you progress and unlock new abilities? I'll have to see...I was really excited for this - and kind of sad that it fell so short. I'm going to continue playing - and hopefully I find some charm/a reason to fall in love...but as it stands right now - I can't recommend this one."
