,Recommended,428180,20921911,"Posted: 2 February, 2016",all,ChillQuill,"This review is for the current version of the game(2/7/16)What is Islet Online?Islet Online is a creative open world sandbox, similar to Minecraft. This game features an experience system that allows you to level up in pretty much everything like jumping, crafting, fighting and much more. These can directly effect your play experience, for example, you may be able to eventually jump up to 4 times in the air. It actually reminds me of McMMO from the old Minecraft Bukkit days.Positives:The devs push out updates and bug fixes at the speed of light. They listen to player reports, and act quickly.This game runs very smooth, with only the occasional hiccup.The art style is cute and fun to look at, especially the player characters. The music is great too!There's quite a bit of crafting you can do.Leveling up everything(that works) is worth your time. For example: Higher crafting level = Higher % success rate.There is a working party system so you can play with your friends. They get marked on the minimap!There are lots of block-types, all of which have their own uses.The ecosystem is fun. If no predators are around, you will have bunnies for DAYS.You can befriend animals.Seems to support all or most resolutions, and has windowed mode.There are multiple worlds you can teleport to, they seem to contain exclusive ores.There's a night/day AND weather cycle, and all the animals go to sleep. (Easy pickings)There is PvP!You can craft and equip several gear-types on yourself.The community is one of the nicest I've ever seen.You can host your own server.Negatives:Those looking for an objective or ""point"" to doing things, you'll want to pass on this game for now.There are spelling and grammatical errors EVERYWHERE. It drives me crazy!The camera likes to get stuck in cramped spaces, preventing you from interacting with the environment. Bad for mining.The controls sometimes don't work right with no rhyme or reason.Players can become glitched in all manner of ways. From being unable to join a group to health not working right.There are no tutorials to help you get started.The map is not generated as you travel, there is an end. It's big enough though.Sometimes interactive blocks will stop working. (Such as doors)Fixed!You have to do quite a bit of grinding to make your character useful.A lot of skills aren't working yet. (But they sound really cool)So is it worth it?That depends what kind of player you are. Those that need objectives or for there to be ""a point"" to keep themselves going will definitely want to pass, at least for now. If you're the type of player who enjoys Minecraft, and you don't mind lots of grinding, then you'll definitely like this game and I can easily recommend it to you. You have to really make your own experience here, which is much easier if you play with friends. There's tons to do, tons to improve, and of course- so many things to build. Hope to see you guys out in the world!(Did you like this review? If so, please vote it up! Feel free to add me as well.)"

It's simple as that.The Good- Perks/leveling system, you can level up your perks by doing crafting, chop some tree, walking and many things to do- Befriend with animals and you can name it, but you can't take it to your house- The ecosystem very good in this game, and always Mr. Bear is the first time extinct.- The characters of this game is cowaii (I mean cute)- You can climb on the tree, wall or something vertical and maybe horizontal too- The community is very nice people but they mostly speak Korean, Chinese, and sometimes English- Party system, so you can party with your friends without being lost somewhere inside tunnel or forest- Land ownership (new feature). As long you use it, others people can't steal your house, hit your house with axe, or something like that- Night and day cycle with weather cycle, but right now it's only rain storm- PvP and PvE using different world/server which is good- I believe you can host your own world and only invited people can join, such as your friend- The devs always update and willing to answer players on the forum- Good optimization, but only few graphic option of choice such as fullscreen-windowed, and resolution- Tutorial just like objective/quest in this game, it flow within gameplay (I hope to see more objective in future patch)- You can riding animals in later update- The music is goodThe Bad and The Ugly- Only 3 animals available right now: Mr.Bear, piggy, bunny (I didn't see wolf for now or maybe they extinct?)- There's no hunger system but be able to hunt bunny? (maybe later update?)- The controls not so bad, there are 2 controls: Minecraft style or click style just like Terraria and Starbound but sometimes I'm always fall down from my house and died- The combat mode uggggghhhhh so bad, need some rework- The world feels empty without birds, its lifeless without it.This game needs- Farming system- Hunger, thristy, and wet when rain (Like Hypothermia?)- Swimming- Fishing (I think the dev update it later)- More monster lurking around inside tunnel or world- NPC- Workshop- Maybe add snow area?Update:Finally you can swim, fishing and more animalDo not see negative reviews, they are not true. This game is good and have potentialI choose this game over Creativerse, Terraria, and Starbound (Sorry no offense). I hope Morenori Soft didnt dissapoint us. Sorry for my bad English, it's not my native language still learning."

There are also loading issues. Sometimes you dig or are just walking and the blocks do not load so you are just standing on nothing and can't see what to do. I have played for a few weeks and its gotten too aggravating people taking stuff down and then not having things save on local. I understand it's an early access game but the developers keep adding new stuff and are not addressing the base issues of the game. In fact the loading got worse after one of the updates."

There are no enemies that could kill you etc.you can only die from falling)"

They're updating the game, yes, but with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ features that are absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing pointless.Thank you for allowing me to waste money, it was fun (!)--Nah, I rushed into buying this because it was a ""newish"" concept and it looked really good.(Was an issue with the desc. claiming the game contained certain features that it didn't. Apparently that's been changing but I don't know.)But that's all it is, isgoodright now.I don't have the best grammar and punctuation but I expectanygame, regardless of where it was made / the language of said location, to haveany and alltranslations to beas bestas possible. But they're using Google Translate (as stated in the forums) to translate more or less all their content, which is a very, very, very, very poor move to make becauseanyonecan tell you that GT is absolutely terrible.It's exetremely barren right now. It's Early Access so I wasn't expecting a finished product - however once you've seen all there is to be offered (Creative Mode) it all gets a little grindy, I dislike playing on global or basic without creative mode because without it, you're just hacking at trees or ores for ages because more or less everything is 0 / 2  = 1 block, etc.-- Might not seem like much but when you've gotten 1/2 through your house / fortress etc, you will understand.Add it to your wish-list and wait until they've updated it a little more. Although updates are lacking in size tbh, I don't really care for the reasons because to be fair, you've taken up the task of developing a game and I would like to see my money being put to good use-- considering the bloody price tag you'd think it would, but no, I don't think it is to be quite honest.Leave it alone for now,maybeget it later."

76561197973270799,Not Recommended,428180,26428857,"Posted: 4 November, 2016",all,Wenyerd,It is a cute game but the devs waste their time on useless updates like TV's or picture frames that it leaves the game lacking an enjoyable environment. The aggressive animals seem to be the only animals that multiply and despite what armor you are wearing will one shot you. I have a lot of hours into this game and finally gave up. Nothing I did made a difference in how animals took over preventing me from being able to walk out of my door without getting killed. I give up. I won't play it again.

Someone could think about this like boring or infantile, but in my opinion and in my friends` opinion, all of us have positive assessment about playing Islet online. We are all addicted in this game and play joyfully. Even other people in the game; Chinese, American, Korean whom I saw were all kind and all neighbor. You will never regret of buying it.

For what the game has in it though, I would wait for a sale."

Well not lot to do in terms of a goal but you can Level Up your skills and play around with the ecosystem.The Controls are not perfect but manageable in the sense that theyre typical for an mmo. Ive only played singleplayer (in offline mode!) thus far but i think that the game is much better in Global Server mode or Multiplayer Coop. The only thing i dont like is the imperfect english translation but the devs are active on the forums and try their best to answer each question. (They`ve gone over various tests for me for my question!)All in all i can recommend this game if you want to support it. But the Price tag for the content included is to high.tl;drPros- Nice Ecosystem feature- Much content for an Early Access Title- Offline Singleplayer and Coop Multiplayer support (Rare for a game thats focused on multiplayer)- Devs respond on the forums and try their bestNeutral- Controls typical for an mmoCons- Not enough content for the pricetag (maybe you should go over the price again dev!)- Imperfect english translation
