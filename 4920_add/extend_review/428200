But there's just too many issues.ProsA unique fighting experience that I've really enjoyed so far.Interestingly mapped out story mode. Looks to have a decently long story.I love the design in general. Of the game, and where the lore comes from as well.ConsThe translation is god awful. It's really bad. There are some cutscenes where the text is in Chinese, when clearly english was chosen.The game constantly flickers for me. It gives me errors about my graphics card, and as the game gets more intense, it becomes more impossible for me to play it. My setup is more than enough to run this game, so unless it's a compatability issue with nvidia gtx graphics (unlikely), I don't see the issue.Very, very little options as far as changing visual settings go. Literally all that's there is an option to change the resolution.I hope I can reccommend this game someday.In case you're about to buy this, here's my rig :Intel Core i7 4720HQ (2.60 GHz) 8 GB Memory 1 TB HDD NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M 2 GB GDDR5 15.6"" Windows 10 Home 64-BitIf yours are like mine, I would NOT reccommend this game to you."

Yeah, the story is alright.The game has content, BUT..... the gameplay is just really disappointing.All I do is use j the most, then k, h, and i depending on leveling the ""generals,"" beside the wasd as directional keys.The game is unique due to graphics and how the game is.But the gameplay was just very dissappointing to me since I'm a huge rpg player. :/"

I'm not talking about non-sense character design which is barely recognizable from the origin: Romance of the three kingdoms; It was not the horrible localization such as ""numbered sisters"" all over the text which was literally ""2nd sister and 3rd sister""; I'm not even talking about the gay joke of dude kissing dude; I'm just saying that when I choose English, it should run in English. It's hilarious to show us a cut-scene with FULL Chinese text in an English version of the game. Even better, once, some comments in Chinese were saying ""no-translation provided"" on the screen. It took me a while to figure that out. What about ""translation server error""? LMAO Use google translate dude! At least make the full game playable yeah? I was speechless, entirely.You need to remove the English tag if the localization is still wip. It's irresponsible and totally not decent. I'm considering it as an act of lacking the respect toward worldwide consumers whom spent money and time on your game.

Great game for a great price. 8/10FYI, I'm playing it using chinese traditional, and via a controller."

But it isn't and thats probably why I like it, because it's another take on the Three Kingdoms story. I really enjoy this game so far with only 36 minutes in. The characters are enjoyable and bright and colorful and the moves each character has is really interesting."
,Recommended,428200,29196986,Posted: 11 January,all,xyberKnight,"Closest thing to the battle system used in Indivisible until it releases.  The aesthetic is terrific, and the grammer is appropriate to its characters.  The music is something straight up inspired by 80's hair metal and Daisuke Ishwatari's own mind.  Love it.  For it being early access, it feels pretty complete, minus some intro screens needing subtitles, and also a way that works to remap dpad that isn't left right for up and down on build 1.06 currently, and extremely satisfied and happy to support this company and title.  I hope that they do DLC packs, or that the game has a lot of other elements to it, like VS mode, or Endless, or Boss Rush, as all would be a good fit for the gameplay.  This is the best kind of Strategy game for an action gamer like me.  No disappointments at all, and it's crack crazy Ultimate moves.  Just hoping that they add evolutions for more than just Mu into Super Mu, because it makes the game go from fast to frantic once you level him up."

(Also stuck on a certain level due to a Combo Condition)+The game is actually an very interesting concept with funny artistic character designs taken from Chinese History and Characters from Romance of the Three Kingdoms. The only catch is that its like a parody with genderbender with some of them (Guan Yu&Zhang Fei are Female but not Lui Bei). Thus the reason you see chinese characters in the game itself.+Its quite beautiful and alive especially the visual effects and its perspective view of 2.5 and 3D. Think of Muramasa: The Demon Blade game if you have played it on the DS or VITA.+Don't worry for the game is fully in English with some funny translation but the Developers are Chinese so its bound to have funny translation.+The Music is also quite amusing to listen since it fits the gameplay. The gameplay itself is situated as a button turn base where you choose the 1 abilities per turn per characters. You can score points by racking up the combo whilst dealing more damage and staggering the enemies so they can't counter attack. Its all about timing.+The map is like Mario where you travel in each node.-/+You can level up each characters with coins you earn from your travels though it will be grinding/farming since you need to level them up just to pass a level.-/+To unlock characters you not only need to get through a certain part of the story but you need certain number of stars to unlock them.+Gamepad is supported though I only tested using X-Input so I have no clue about D-Input.-There are some minor bugs to be found though its nothing Game breaking.-/+Some dialog when playing in English weren't translated but they will fix it next month.

This truelly is a gem for all who love fast pase, thinking 2 steps ahead, cute cartoony character beat em up games... BUT! This game have a slight twist then the normal beat em up game...There are no direct control of your hero's movement, they taking turns jump into then fight then withdraw when the next hero enter the battle, and the control have been split for both left and right hand...Left hand WASD = Controlls the roaster of heroes in your team, game will auto rotate your heroes if no extra command was given, but you can use WASD keys to force select a hero from your roaster so you can unleash one of his skill that is not in cooldown.Right hand IHJK = Controlls the 4 skills of each hero. J is the basic attack, that every heroes start with at lv1. K is advanced tier attack, and H is higher tier attack, Heroes unlock this 2 at higher level. I is ultimate attack, and also the last skill to be unlocked, they are not just dealing large amount of damage, they also laster way longer then any other attacks, and the lasting effect extend into 1-2 more heroes's turn.The goal of this game is to plan and form combos with the attacks of your heroes, and use those attack to ether stunlock or push back waves of enemy, but enemy do have special ability or will be located at areas that some attacks just won't be able to touch them, so it will be up to the player to form up a team of heroes to bring down those annony buggers.This game have a really fast gaming pace, really nice graphic for an indie game, funky cartoony design... It is fun to play, and even the music make me want to record it for my MP3 player!!Okie.. I forgot to mention the down side... Due to this is a Chinese indie game, so far only some of the dialogues (most of them) and menus were translated into English, other in-game signs like ""Let The Battle Begin!"", ""Show them what you can do!"" and ""Victory!"" are still in Chinese... So it might be eyesore for some Internet Nazi, but not a big issue for normal game player. :P"

,Recommended,428200,22437518,"Posted: 15 April, 2016",all,KA1,"i have always been wary of games like this, but i am glad i took the plunge and purchased it.have only played just over an hour and i am thoroughly enjoying it. i like the links to the three kingdoms elements and enjoy the twist on that history and its people/events.the game itself its only confusing for mere minutes as once you figure out team turns and moves you can come up with some ace combos and link attacks. as you level up your characters with the coins you gain from battles you gain more moves.and so far i have 2 characters that can use 2 certain moves in 1 turn which adds to the planning. another thing i have learnt is setup for moves. its worth noting range and where the move puts the enemy, as this can make or break a combo if the enemy is in the worng place for the next characters move.as mentioned in other reviews there are a few tiny bugs and some funny translations, but overall an ace game thats worth much more than the current asking price."
,Recommended,428200,22513408,"Posted: 19 April, 2016",all,man3k,"This game is a good time/stress/boredom killer, the plot is typical but okay and the characters are very funny. The mix of action & strategy looks nonsense at the beginning, but as soon you progress you'll need to adjust timing to your attacks and use character types wisely and level them up accordingly. It's like a turn-based action rpg with side scrolling view.https://youtu.be/TPym4LCKvMYThere a some yet-to-be-translated parts but it's safe to say the game is still understandable and only affecting further stages/less important parts of the game. Depending of your confidence to the devs, you may wait or support this title now and enjoy the game like many others have. I did not regret the amount i've spent. Some of you may differ regarding it's quality, but as far as i'm concerned the price point is acceptable."

During a hero's attack friendly heroes can join with their helper attack if available. Also: cute anime style.https://youtu.be/8-1R83Mg3S8The PROS outweigh the cons- Unique gameplay!- Many enemy types- Cute style with big Chinese text on the screen- Fun enough story. 2 of the main characters have enough personalityCONS- Just 4 girls in the game? And 8 guys . . .- If you think you play a level, and then continue to the next level and continue with the story, no! You usually need to play the same levels again to complete challenges that are only available after beating the level once, and your character may not be strong enough to stand enough of a chance to beat the next level.- Combo challenges can be literally impossible if your characters are too leveled up and kill enemies too quickly.- The leveling up system plays a bit too much of a role for replayability: If you just want to play a much earlier level because it was fun, it won't be challenging any more."

Its almost like the ""Project X Zone"" games for the 3DS. By that i mean that you controll a set amount of characters, you start with 3 and then as you progress you unlock more characters. You add or remove people from your group of 4 and follow a story based adventure where every stage is a combat scenario. Every character has 4 abilities, when you use one, the ability gets a cooldown and you switch to the next character and keep the combo chain going. The game is quite interesting, kinda funny story so far.The only thing that i need to comment on which could be improved is the UI and the text. Sometimes the screen dosn't fit with texts and icons cover some things around the screen. Regarding the text of the game, anyone could understand it except some parts like ""Titles"" for the stages being in chinese letters only. But there's alot of spelling errors such as. ""You unlocked a stage star (Icon) Use it to unlock next stag"" or ""then take care of the troublr on left"". Minor things but I'm looking forward to see how this game develops."
