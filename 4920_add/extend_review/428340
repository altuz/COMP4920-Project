It's just amazing. you can create your own shorts and GIFs and probably make your own miniseries with this. The UI is just plain awesome, I had no issues at all. You new content creators don't even need tutorials, it's very easy to learn and can unlock your mind to PC Graphics at the entry level. This software is just bomb. Definately reccommend this to any of you graphic designers and people who want to have fun making some art.10/10, No reason to suspect otherwise."
,Recommended,428340,31549311,Posted: 4 May,all,Ringrustig,"This is a great software! If you enjoy making pixel or voxel art, this is right up your alley.There are just a few things i'm missing however, or at least not able to find.1. Being able select all layers at once and moving everything selected on the screen.2. Mirroring a selection (not just inverting it or flipping it).3. Editing the glow of every layer individually instead of globally. (I know there's a glow option on the layers, but it's maxed out already.)4. I also had problems with the animator, i cannot seem to get the opacity working, it's stuck globally so every frame has the same opacity, which is troublesome if you want to make something utilizing the opacity options.Then there are many other minor tweaks but that's just going into detail and nothing to add into a review, it's long enough as it is already."

Another piece of software that says it does something others don't or can't do as easy.As a hobby, wannabee game developer I'm often in need of fast and easy ways to create certain types of graphics. Hex grids, tiled backgrounds, that kind of stuff.With this software I'm just able to do that. Create a tiled map and texture every single section anyway I see fit.Export the thing as a png, maybe do some post work on it and I'm set to use it in my favorite game developing  application.Just for that, for the ease of use, I give Marmoset Hexels 2 a big thumbs up."

This will be a good tool to get the art, be it drawn or 3d rendered, to the right size.  Works for art and pictures, I scaled down and cut-out some images and they looked like CapCom game art.  I'm no ""Pro"" more a storyteller who dabbles in art, but for a ""Retro"" fun, hard to beat this, definitely not for the price!Very good at importing/scaling pictures, works with layers to trace, etc.  Going to start practicing animations and stuff, don't forsee any problems, just this thing really does deserve a good review.  And this is like my first Steam review, I'm not into reviewing stuff here! (got to change that, I've loved most things I've got here!)"

Although missing a few features, its nothing to stop you from doing anything. I still have yet to play with everything it has to offer but it seems stable so far. Ive only had fun so its thumbs up from me."

,Recommended,428340,22899452,"Posted: 10 May, 2016",all,heartnewts,"An extremely powerful software for unique trixel and mixel artwork, plus powerful for pixelart as well. The grid is easy, the animation controls are intuitive and you can turn off the glow and textures to your choosing.The developer is active in forum to help you out and this is probably one of my favorite new drawing programs. You can't go wrong with Hexels 2 if you are looking for something to give your art a unique look or a little extra zing."

76561198144001908,Recommended,428340,26668389,"Posted: 18 November, 2016",all,Pixellore,"Hexels 2 is good. It's good for what it does and its unique grid based painting has some interesting possibilities compred to the other pixel art tools out there. However, I think it still has some more rooms for a improvement because the base technology sounds great but it feels a bit under utilized.For example, it could be a really great tool for creating not just a piece of art but in-game ready isometric art assets, but it isn't that straight forward yet. Adding some constraint drawing mode can help a lot with this tool. Hexels looks like it can create awesome angled, isometric pixel art and it dose, but it just need that extra drawing tools / modifiers to help itself.Having said all that, I am eager and hopeful for the future development of this tool and it just may be the Maya of 2D pixel art. It just need that 10% f extra ""ohh, cool"" factor when you actually use the tool. Hexels can already do a lot, but it can do a lot better."
,Recommended,428340,22581507,"Posted: 22 April, 2016",all,Velvet Lobster,"This app is awesome. I found some minor persistent bugs (well, I mean, behavior that seems like bugs), but even so its the best drawing tool on steam if you want fast paced quality drawing and animation. The animation part, the effects and the usability are the things that got my attention. I ve been trying some animations and pixel art and it really speeds things up.If you use a drawing tablet you can try the dynamic opacity feature, really handy."
