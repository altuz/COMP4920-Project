,Recommended,428350,20597405,"Posted: 17 January, 2016",all,Hooks,"I have to say, Fear Equation is my favorite of Screwfly's games. It blends the people management from Zafehouse: Diaries and the mission systemd from Deadnaut, without being super sophisticated. The learning curve is small, and you get the hang of things very quickly. It is very difficult, even with some of the easier engineers (engineers are the person you play as). I was a little hesitant at the beginning worrying that it would be too complicated and I would want to stop, but worked through my first few days on the train, got the hang of it, and was sucked into it for hours (And then died, customized the passengers as my friends, and started again.)As usual with Screwfly games there is a cool customization feature, where you can create your friends, family, and yourself as the engineer of the train and see them all show up. When creating a passenger it is pretty simple and straightforward, and includes ways to increase stats like choosing their occupation. There is also a pretty wide variety of portraits the game comes with for faces of your custom passengers, or if you're really into it you can put your friends' actual faces into the game folder and use it in-game. Lastly on the custom passengers there is a three question sheet that determines what faction that passenger will usually be in, and how influenciual they will be to other passengers in their carriage.You can also customize you engineer, the portraits are the same and you can choose different atributes for your engineer that will make the game easier/harder.I would recommend this game to most everyone, and I hope you enjoy playing."

All the base concepts and ideas of it are rock solid, new, and refreshing.  But for all the fresh and fantastic ideas, the game falls short in execution.[GAME BASIS]You own a train in a world plagued by a hellish fog that causes peoples nightmares to become deadly reality.  You are chugging your way from place to place finding survivors and trying to reach a final destination point.  You are in the engine room of the train, and have outfitted it to be perfectly immune to the fog and the hellish things that come out of it.  Sensibly, you never leave your room.You are tasked with a number of duties.  You are the god of this little salvation train, and as such, call absolutely all of the shots.  You need fuel to keep it running, food for all the passengers, and upgrades to the train to make it more efficient and well defended from attacks.  All of these things require supplies.  And you certainly aren't going out there to retrieve them.  Your passengers are.  You decide who goes out, and you decide how they approach their smash and grab tactics of looting places of everything useful before the pseudo-sentient fog gets too thick and swallows them up.  In addition to this, the game has a reasonably in depth citizen management element.  Your passengers will form cliques and factions with other likeminded passengers, and you need to keep them happy enough that they don't come smash through the door of your cabin and kill you.  On the other hand, you could be such a benevolent and skillfull leader that they start more or less worshipping you, and will outright murder other passengers that don't share their fanatical devotion to you.[THE PROBLEMS]Where the game falls short is a simple lack of involvement and lack of true choices.  Most ""days"" in game feel exactly the same as the one before, and very dull.  You direct passengers on what to upgrade, and then go to sleep and see if the ship gets attacked.  If it does, you do absolutely nothing about it.  It's just a matter of how many defenses against that type of attack you have constructed in the past that factors in to the results.  You wake up, read the report on how the attack went, and repeat the same steps.  choose upgrades.  Go to sleep and see if you are attacked.You do plot the course of the train on a map though.  And make informed decissions based on things you're hearing over the radio.  However, you rarely have much in the way of any real choice.  A track is a straight line, so you only really have two ways to go.  And back tracking is virtually never worth it, as the fog is always worse behind you, your fuel is limited, and you've probably sacked the locations behind you already.  So you go forwards.  The tracks branch here and there, but even if you make an effort to upgrade your radio heavily to improve your intel on the map, your choices are still pretty much nill.  At any given branch, it's almost always a dead obvious choice.  One route is clearly superior to the other.  Even if by some miracle, the options are almost equal in details, the obvious route is the shorter one, since your fuel is a limited commodity.The most interactive and intriguing part of the game is the loot and rescue operations you perform at stops.  You direct your team of 5 passengers that you hand picked yourself, based on their skills at smashing and grabbing, on whether to be a guard or a looter.  and on the floorplan of the building you mysteriously have on hand, you direct them where to go guard or loot.  You have estimated amounts of time it will take them to do it.  And you know how long you have before the fog rolls in and starts eating people (you got a degree in engineering AND occult weather phenomena apparently).  So there's some risk/reward here, where you can choose to really push those time estimations tight for longer looting time, or make a clean safe run where they have a good bit of breathing room, but possibly less loot.  There's definitely some thought to go in to this.  It's almost overwhelming your first time, though that is largely due to an obnoxious UI.  But like the rest of the game, it quickly becomes extremely obvious.  And this is largely due to lack of details and lack of involvement.  All you know is the layout of the building, the names of the rooms (kitchen, bathroom, storeroom, etc.), and how long it will take when you send person X to do their job.  Generally what you will find in a room is obvious where applicable, like a kitchen containing food.  But the vast majority of rooms are basically a piniata you whack at and see what comes out.  Storeroom of a bank?  Ok?  Bathrooms?  Lounges?  who knows what you'll turn up from those places.  The worst oversight of the game, in my opinion, is that once you finish planning and begin the operation, you are nothing but a spectator.  You watch on your radar as your team moves in and does their jobs, and they radio updates in to you in real time, letting you know if they find things, survivors, etc.  But you yourself do nothing at all.  Unexpected issues basically don't exist.  Occasionally ""The Fearless"" will be on the map and wander it trying to attack your team.  But ultimately, there is no point watching any of it.  Because you can't do anything.  Despite the radio beside you, you can't call out a change of plan.  You can't call Billy back and tell him to abort because there's a fearless wandering right in to his room.  Billy just stays in there and loots mindlessly until eaten.  And you just sit and watch on your radar like a sick weirdo.This part of the game was really its chance to shine.  But it falls short.  This was a chance to get some solid gameplay in that had actual decission making that wasn't obvious.  You shouldn't know everything about these buildings that you do.  And at the same time, you should get more details as the operation proceeds.  If it was a bit more like a RTS mini game, where you are revealing more of the map as you direct your team through the building, searching for useful items, telling them how to attack things if they are a threat, etc. it would be extremely cool.  But as implemented, it's a pretty dull experience after your first couple missions.The citizen management aspect is equally lacking.  They did a great job with the presentation of your passengers, having a sizeable random pool of photos, a good random name generator, and important statstical and idealogical differences between them that will make you want to remember their names and faces when making decissions.  Each carriage even elects a leader, and the leader can impact the mindset of the others in the cabin.  It's really neat.  But that great presentation only really makes it more disapointing that you have so little involvement or interaction with any of them.  You can't discuss anything with anyone.  Choices over social issues do exist, but I've only seen one in a lets play video.  I've only played 5 hours, but thats 5 hours with NEVER encountering one of those choices.  It would almost be better if they hadn't put so much effort in to making your passengers feel so individualized.  It's like dangling a carrot in front of you that you can never actually get.[CONCLUSION]5/10.  Fantastic ideas.  Truly fantastic.  But every last one of them felt woefully shallow in developement.  If these ideas were developed more deeply, and the player had more involvement and more interesting decissions to make, this game would be something very special.  But alas, I can't recommend it."

Fear Equation is a horror game set aboard a train, what role do you play? You are the engineer! Or well I guess the guy who runs the entire train aswell, you are given certain areas to view things and interact such as the notebook which is where you will decide who does what via a lottery (Which I believe you can rig so only certain people get chosen) and upgrades, Defence building and Dream Logs. There is a computer which you do all the scavenging from and listening to comms. The front is where you man the train and decide where to go, if you stop the train and turn of the Throttle the battery will drain and if it runs out the entire train will go dark and depending on how long it's out for will depend on how many people disapear and never return, you however are completely safe. The back of the train is where you sleep and hope everything will be Okay!---Gameplay---One part you have to study dream logs and then counter possible threats depending on how many people are having said things in their dreams with defences such as barricades, heat etc, you have no other control over what they do. You can increase power to their carridges though I haven't found a use or problem for doing so as the tutorial seemed to just stop abruptly which in a sense is good as what's scary about a game when you know how to do everything. On the computer you will do scavenging which is similar to Dreadnaught except you only plan what they do and how long and then sit back and watch, make sure you have enough time as if the fog rolls in and they are in there then people will start disapearing and never been again. You use resources from that time in the next day where you build the defences and upgrades etc.--Is it Scary?--I'd say there's more tension than actual horror in this game, there are some creepy scenes you will see at night through visions of sorts but nothing that will make you jump out for your seat (Though I haven't died or hopefully not seen all the scenes yet).--Custom Game--This is a mode where you can choose from either preset cards with their own settings or create your own Engineer with custom or preset profile picture, you decide how hard or how easy the game will be, think the fog gets dense to fast? Choose the slow fog modifier. Think getting upgrades for something is too hard? Get it full upgraded. Think upgrading make the game to easy? Block the ability to upgrade. You can choose multiple ones to properly define your experience.--Conclusion--I'd say for the Current price it's worth it, there's a lot of content and even custom which I haven't checked out yet but I will and update this review later. I give it a 9.5/10 For being a very unique and fun experience.--YouTube--https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv9D6LJ0jH4"

It seemed relatively simple and I wondered where the ""game"" was.However, I wanted to give it a chance, if for no other reason than being sick to death of games that focus on the ""immediate"" attention grab at the expense of depth and longevity.I'm glad I did! I makes me think of things like FTL or Magic: The Gathering, where it's not about a big single thing that takes you to victory, but small advantages over the long run that get you over the line.Kudos to the dev. In this day and age where most games are all about ""Get their attention, get them to spend money then who gives a ♥♥♥♥ if they like it long term"" Fear Equation is unique and refreshing."

I wish there was a better system in steam then just yay or nay? Because this game kind of leans closer to the middle then being outright bad.That said it has some problems that need to be ironed out but can, and probably will, be fixed.1.	Mrjihun pointed out the save problem has been explained. Thanks Mrjihun!2.	After the fog attacks give me a summary of the damage that occurred. Lack of information isn’t just damaging to gameplay, it’s also boring in a game that is all about information and the decisions you make.3.	Fuel needs to be much more common because a “Hail Mary” should be a last resort when the random number generator really messed you up, not something you do regularly.4.	I understand the limitation to only sending five passengers out at once to scavenge for both technical and story based reasons. That said what I don’t understand is the mission team not bringing everyone you meet onboard the train, or as the “driver” my having the option to revisit a location to grab supplies they skipped out on the first trip. I admit I may have missed key details about how missions work but I remind you of the tutorial problem for any error on my part with this criticism.5.	The game feels generally vague and brief about everything it tries to explain. That said at the same time much of what I little I actually do feels like it’s largely out of my hands, and decided by the random number generator.This game like previous Screwfly Studios games is all about information and decisions. The problem is the information I am given regularly doesn’t feel exciting or interesting, which the same goes for the defences/upgrades I am building, or the passengers I am managing. The first exciting thing to have happened to me was when the train was attacked by the fog, but a lack of details about what happened made it very anti-climactic. The next exciting thing was reaching a town after six long days of skipping time, ended up being significantly less interesting then searching a house in Zafehouse diaries, when it should have been at least as interesting.I suspect it gets better when you have a larger train population so you can actually get faction intrigue. But the trip to get there is too boring and devoid of interesting things for me to do to be worthwhile. However considering Zafehouse Diaries again, I didn’t particularly enjoy that game when it was first released either but the developers made significant strides to improve it afterwards. So this review maybe entirely useless in six months, but for now I can’t recommend this game."

While most games at least have a reddit sub dedicated to them, there is nothing for this game at all.  Very few comments on indie game sites as well.  Which is a shame, since it seems that, as a forgotten game, the chances of ever getting a sequel with enhanced mechanics is slim.My only complaint with the game is that the social/faction mechanic is simply not as fleshed out as it could be.  That whole aspect can be almost ignored with no consequence.  Do they like you?  Are they going to revolt?  Meh...no matter most of the time.  I would have liked to see some more interaction with the passengers themselves; in terms of maybe getting more detailed information by clicking on an individual passenger (relationship graphs to other passengers and to you.  rumours, etc...) and perhaps be able to take more actions to affect their behaviour (ie. craft an edict.  make a deal to send someone in with propaganda, etc...)In the end, it feels like an amazing game that has a single part of it that feels...incomplete and unimportant somehow.  it's a shame this game doesn't get much love on social media since I would LOVE so much to see a sequel someday.If you're looking for a roguelike to pick up and play that gives you an amazing and original atmoshere, this is definitely the game you need to try."

,Not Recommended,428350,20889703,"Posted: 1 February, 2016",all,Alexander,"It seems to be complicated at first in terms of many manuals, but after a couple of hours, it's rather repeating to do the same things: get up to assign orders and work, scavenge, set destination, call it a day and then get up bla bla. Let me explain why that is.It lacks stories and that is the biggest issue making it repeating. Yes it has a clear main story: you're the engineer in charge of train and your main goal is to get as many survivors as possible to escape from the fog and reach the final destination. But the problem is the journey to that final revelation. Honestly I don't mind going through same game phases such as lottery, orders, work, and guard but it's a pain to do them in a dull way as the game moves on. Basically there is no story-based events like side quests, hazards, or accidents when going through all of the game phases. You just set where you wanna go and manage the resourses, inculding passengers, fuel tanks, food supplies, etc. Don't get me wrong. I love micromanaging but not in a boring way. So what I do is to make sure my passengers that I assign to scavenge stay alive when they are searching that area. Also build defense against the fog attacks at the last game phase. That's it, that's the main part of the game. If you're a fan of strategy board games, you might enjoy reading intriguing narritives on your quest cards. In this game, nothing; only random fog attacks and dispute of passengers with no stories or narritives.It's not a bad game though, but definetly need to put depth in it. Give it a try, but do it on sale since it's not worth $15."

It's irritating having to switch between the notebook and the sections of the train just to check the current time.Being able to set priorities. I normally stack up a few things for the passengers to do so they're never left idle, but this becomes a problem when one thing always has priority.A slight bit more interactivity with the environment. This is just a small thing, but I'd like to be able to turn off the lights in my bed area, or set the timer on the computer for no reason, or just to turn the radio off.Different views for the modifiers in custom mode. Flicking through the cards is nice to do for a while, but it becomes a pain finding what you want with a limited view of them.Still a fantastic game though, and I'd recommend it if you enjoy the idea of being behind the scenes of a train while escaping from creepy horror fog."

And a day can be long.The immersion is low because multiple generated persons can have the same photo and there is no interaction between the people other than some random chatting at the end of a scavenger run."

But the gameplay is just wonky and strange.Unless i am an idiot (Prob am) it does not tell you how to upgrade your trains fuel or Structural integrity and also does not tell you how to move passengers to another car. It does have a spooky atmosphere though and i do like that. The other thing is the movement, it seems delayed, which would be no big deal if the tutorials tought you more.Pros: Good Graphics, Cool Concept, Management Sim.Cons: Minimal Tutorial system makes it very confusing by only telling you basics.Confusion Confusion Confusion.The tutorial is the only thing this game needs more of, If it would teach you how to do more things i would play it more. (I have read all the notes i have found and i still don't know how to play the game fully, been on 2 scavenge runs and stopped on the 3rd.)Is it worth it? If you want to ""Try"" to learn the more advanced mechanics then be my guest. If you are looking for quick fun than stay away from this.I have applied for a refund on this, Maybe if it's better in the future i'll buy it. But at the moment i just can't be bothered to play it.Sorry dev's, no hard feelings though.(Do not hate me because my Opinion is Different than your's, Everyone has one, I'm just voicing mine.)"

I want to first state that I appreciate Screwfly's commitment to making unusual games, with unusual game mechanics.Sadly, I don't feel the game is, well, fun. I'd just rather be playing something else. There's a level of abtruseness to some aspects of the design that would take a lot of time and effort to learn how to use correctly, and the game just isn't fun enough to warrant that time investment.I can't recommend it, at least not to people like myself. I think there is a niche here, so if you want to try a really original game design, or if you just want to support developers who are willing to try new things, give the game a play."

The only good thing I have to say is that I've never seen anything like it, so props to the developers for thinking outside the box but I didn't like it."

Some games liek Crusader Kings 2 make you want to learn the game and become emersed in it; not so for Fear Equation.  Even in tutorial the bland layout, confusing directions, not knowing what relates to what.. just awful awful execution.  Give some orders like building and not know how to do anything else (fast forward time) click a direction the train goes (fast forward time) go to sleep (fast forward time) everyone is dead... restart and repeat with the same lack of instructions.  The point and click system is horrible.  I was clicking on EVERYTHING and all I could do was read instruction manuals that would guide me in a meaningless way because I couldn't click on anything like character portraits to equip them or orders... nothing.  Avoid this one as I go to get my money back."
