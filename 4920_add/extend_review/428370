There is now a warning, and reviews should be based on the game itself, not your lack of an iron stomach.Original ReviewWindlands is a veryinfuriatingpeaceful game. Though it only has one level, the game is still very new on Steam and the developer has recently updated the game to include a challenge level. With a VR headset, you willget paranoid of heightsenjoy the game more fully and it will be a much better experience. A controller is also recommended (especially a Steam controller), so youcan rage at the camera controlscan move much more fluidly.Update 2/6/16The game now includes another challenge level that is much more fun than the old one. This one focuses almost solely on swinging, which to me is the best part about this game. Also, theunfairtime-consuming platforming at the top of the jungle levelishas been claimed to be more fair. I haven't been up there since the update, but I believe it is much better.Update 3/2/16There is now adeathtrapcity level in addition to the jungle one. I haven't explored much of it, but as far as I know it requires skill and patience.DO NOT PLAY WITH A TRACKPADRemember, a mouse or Steam controller will greatly increase your ability to play this level.Update 4/15/16Now that the game has been fully released, I took the time to complete both the city level and the sky level. Again,DO NOT PLAY WITH A TRACKPADa mouse is recommended for optimal play. The advanced rope is a necessity, so farmiliarize yourself with it before heading into the sky levels. There is lots ofrageplatforming, and you will find yourselfrestarting over and overenjoying the game and feeling triumphant with every jump.Update 6/18/16My HTC Vive arrived early, but I forgot to update this review when I got it. The biggest thing I want to address here is nausea. The game may or may not make you nauseous, it didn't affect me as much as it seems it affects others. If you like what this game has to offer in terms of gameplay, go ahead and buy it.If you throw upIf you feel nauseous, you can just refund the game, because you aren't going to start feeling dizzy after two hours if you haven't after ten minutes.

I found myself grinning and 'oo'ing and 'aww'ing as I jumped and grappled around.I hope this type of game continues to grow in the VR plane, it gives folks like me with bad legs a chance to do things we can't do anymore.

BUT i know this game is in Early Access and im willing to over look the price part. Because I have been waiting for YEARS to play the ""Full Version"" of this game. I was that guy who got the broken demo build of the is game when the demo first came out. I played that demo alot, even though it was a small world with three crystals i still was entertained for days on end. and if you are wonder what i meant by ""broken build of the demo"" let me explain what i mean. After you get the 3 crystals a door opens and a beam was supposed take you to the top so you can finish a final challange and then get too the top and win. But on this build the beam didn't work so i kinda gave up on the game for a bit but eventully came back and found a way up, which took hours of trying but i eventually got it XD I even uploaded a video showing how to get up, but little did i know like a week after i got the build another one came out and fixed the problem so some guy told me in the commets they fixed it, so needless to say that video isnt up anymore. (ps: i still have the broken build Xb) oh and I dont even have an hour on this game because i got all the crysals so quickly. and if you dont belive me look and my screen shots. but enough bragging :b Im definitely looking forward to the many updates to come and when the Full full game is released then i will make my final judgments.But for what its RIGHT NOW i do not think its worth the price. hope this helped ;D"

The developer didnt even have an grain of sand's worth to issue the complaint; but still did it as a means of attack. Thats pretty low.Anyways in all seriousness the game is pretty boring anyways. You dont even get a thrill of swinging since 90% of the time you are just climbing on top of trees by spamming your hook at close range. If VR wasnt so new this game would have zero sales.

It was the first VR title I've played that didn't use teleporting for movement. Thankfully I'm not too prone to motion sickness, and in about 15 minutes I was used to flying around and the butterflies in my stomach calmed down.That said, it's a great platformer. Super Mario meets Spiderman. Runs great on subpar hardware too (I'm using a GTX 950 and have no issues with framerate). I don't particularly care for the areas that rely solely on jumping that much, but that's partly because the grappling hooks are incredibly fun once you master using your momentum to fly around.Give it a shot, and if you do vomit everywhere, well get your refund and move on. If you've got the stomach for it though, I highly recommend it!"

I have not played it in ""normal mode"". ~~It's extremely fun using the motion controllers to swing from tree to tree, and you can get a real sense of vertigo and panic when on a ledge or falling. It is definitely the kind of game that could get someone motion sick if they aren't up for it. It took me about 3-4 minutes of controlling before I got used to it. A day later, I loaded it up and didn't even need to get used to it. I don't get motion sick at all playing this, and enjoy it quite a lot. Please note: that's just me. Others might still get sick, I don't know for certain how it will affect the average person.+ Seems like there's a lot of content for $20. I would say it's absolutely worth it.+ You don't want to stop playing for a long time+ Excellent art design that compliments VR immensely~ Some aspects of the game seem a little rough around the edges, particularly UI, but a lot of it feels very polished for an early access game.- Locomotion system, while not uncomfortable, can be hard to control. It feels like I'm sliding when moving with the pad, and that can make it hard to land on small platforms. Using the grappling hooks is always my preferred way to get around, but that's not always an option."

When a object in motion moves nearer what it's tethered to momentum should be preserved and rotational velocity increased, but you slow down instead for some reason.Worth checking out on sale."

I'll admit I was very uncomfortable playing this game with the Vive to start but it did get better after several (very) short plays. The key to this is playing just until you're uncomfortable and then taking the headset off and resting. For me it went1) Made it out of the main hall and jumped2) Grappled a few trees, missed the ground and fell3) Try to make it a little farther each play4) Get to the main hub and realize that you've been playing continously for half an hour just jumping and swinging.This all works much better seated to start as I still sway and occasionally almost fall standing, but I don't feel immdeiately sick playing now and ""sick"" now translates to mild discomfort.This game is a must have once you get over the initial acceleration sickness and if you can move without any abrupt stops or starts, I honestly don't think the movement would be an issue at all."

The large floating blocks of coloured stone, grass and trees create a fantastic environment for swinging around using your super stretchy arms. As many of the current negative reviews point out though - this game is not easy at present! Momentum must be built up with run ups and landing on the teflon coated platforms requires planning to avoid sliding off into oblivion.Controlling your mute spiderman is done (on xbox controller) by using the thumbsticks for movement and orientation, whilst using the right and left triggers for flinging out your respective arms. The press and hold method in order to keep your hands stuck to the desired bit of foliage is intuitive but I wish I'd had clearer indication that holding the 'B' button would stop the arms reeling in and unwind to their maximum length. Using this made accessing certain areas much less frustrating and more enjoyable.The difficulty curve of the only map where you can collect the blue crystals is perfect when it represents the whole game. It will however be interesting to see how the developer fleshes the concept out into a full game without compromising what currently makes this game great.Pros:- Great minimal art style enchances the game by making objectives clear- Matching minimal sound/music creates atmosphere- Easy to learn, hard to master gameplay- Works flawlessly on Rift dk2 (runtime 0.8 on GTX 760)Cons:- Sharp learning curve for first level- Little variation beyond accurate platforming- Lonely world- Currently not a lot of content"

Its no wonder now they want to try and hide their easily recreated in a couple hours game mechanics from the rest of the VR indy development scene.The game itself was one of the first game that used mechanics that introduced motion sickness to its users on the Vive and failed at providing any sort of meaningful storyline or even a purpose to the original game. In all fairness I have heard they have implemented a new level and possibly some sort of ending but I honestly haven't even bothered firing up this title in over 5 months because their is just way better content out there made by people who want to push the VR scene farther rather than try and bully youtubers who are only trying to help out beginning indy developers and introduce them to concepts that will help them to push their skills and projects farther. Support those who support you instead of supporting those who want to take a walled garden approach to content and mechanics.Honestly I don't like doing this as much as you don't like the hassle but Windlands IS special (As is the mentality of its developers clearly) and I would like it to see it and its development team get all the recognition it rightfully deserves.

Granted it's more interesting than just teleporting everwhere you want to go unless it's within a few feet.Here's the kick: I was having so much fun just swinging around that I kept wanting to power through so I could keep playing. It's beautiful and surreal and exhilarating. Eventually, I hit the point where my disorientation was overpowering my enjoyment, and had to call it.

I can only assume that this is enhanced when you play it on the Vive because you're constantly moving, adjusting, watching your step, and swinging your way across a level to hidden collectibles and objectives.Initially was on the fence about this game, but I was able to find the right settings for me to allow me to play this game without feeling ill. I think it had to do with turning the comfort VR OFF. The smooth movement seems like it would be fine as we're so used to it in traditional controller-based and non-VR games, but the acceleration it does in VR when you turn is not fun after a while and has a cumulative effect on your body. I was sweating and not feeling well in my stomach after 1.5 hours the first go-round. The next session, I turned the comfort VR setting back on (so turning is done in increments) and I was able to play for hours without much discomfort at all and was able to truly enjoy the experience.The one thing I feel like could be improved somewhat is the response to the direction pad inputs. Sometimes it feels like it's too sensitive and other times I cannot get it to do what I want. It's usually sensitive in the game world when I'm trying to turn and stiff in the menus.Other than that, I really do recommend this game.

The swinging mechanic is very complex, and without some simple example scenarios it's very difficult to get the hang of, and the constant failure just isn't fun.2.  The control setup just doesn't work correctly on Vive.  I tried several times to change it, but the actual behavior in game didn't match what the UI said it was supposed to do.3.  The developer or publisher is a negative force in this small (VR) industry.  I've been a professional game developer for over 10 years and most people in the industry got their start by copying some game mechanic, or art, or story style, in a personal project.  Going after a member of the community who is trying to educate the developers of tomorrow is just plain wrong, especially when their use of your copyrighted material so clearly falls under fair use.

All make the game feel more fun and more satisfying when you reach the crystals.Despite the videos showing the demo world, this features new maps, and they feel a little tricker than the old one which I quite like. There's a couple of memorable structures from the original game which was nice to see, but it's essentially brand new! It's split into a hub and world system now which seems like a nice way to continually grow the game. I've only tried playing this game in VR, so can't comment otherwise, but with a DK2 it's an absolute blast. Making the final few jumps in each area is totally nerve-wracking and when you build up your confidence you can make some amazing dash and swing combos.For anyone new to the game, confidence is key, just go at an area full-speed and you can make some very risky plays! :)"

Nicer graphics, worse gameplay!For starters, you can only grab the leaves on the tree. So about 99% of the game is off limits for your grappling hooks. Tree bark, dirty, craggy rocks... NO. Just leaves. ONLY LEAVES!They also removed the teleporter spikes that were so important to reaching those hard-to-reach locations. Those spikes were AWESOME because they let you setup your own checkpoints, wherever you wanted.  Now all it has are generic checkpoint gates, which are few and far between. Get ready to retrace ALOT of your steps.And don't plan on enjoying all of that retracing. The game is now heavily focused on, of all things, WALKING! The entire ""hook"" of the game are the grappling hooks and they want you to spend half the game walking! What were they thinking???I really wanted to enjoy this game, it's trilling to swing around like Spiderman or Tarzan, but they've took a great original game and poisoned it with ill fitting and outdated gaming convention. I really miss the old game! The whole game kinda feels like it was hijacked by somebody other then the original developer. Or maybe the original developer didn't understand what a gem is was before. Whatever the case, it's been thoroughly trashed."

Using the Vive's controllers to swing from tree to tree feels great, and the game is georgous and vibrante however I tend to almost fall over everytime I play this game because of how my body wants to move with the momentum.Windlands for HTC Vive suffers from bad controls. Joystick locomotion does not work well on the Vive. Not only can it be very sickening, but the controls themselves feel unresponsive. Most of the time this doesn't matter, as the grappling hooks are the main locomotion solutions, however the horrible joystick locomotion REALLY rears its head when the game uses jumping-platforming instead of the hooks. Why is standard platforming even apart of this game? It is incredibly frustrating and not fun. I hope they remove those sections. The joy of this game comes from the grappling, not from jumping with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls.That said, the game is still really cool and worth checking out, but god damn those controls."

Now that it is finally complete, I've been able to go further in for the first time with the Vive.Windlands is a first person platformer in a sense, with a unique way to move around the world. Early in the game you will acquire two grappling hooks, which are the only tools you'll need to navigate the world. The core gameplay is based around finding collectibles dotted around the world, and you'll use the grappling hooks in a style reminiscent of the Manoeuver Gear in the anime series Attack on Titan. You can pick up a lot of momentum once you get skillful using the hooks, and when you do it's thrilling.On the Vive it is a much richer experience, mostly due to the decoupling of aim and head orientation, and the ability to fire two hooks simultaneously. This gives you a lot more control over where you will end up and more awareness of your surroundings as on the Rift you must always be looking directly at where you want your next hook to go. You will have a good experience on either headset system however as I enjoyed my time with it using the Oculus DK2.As many others have mentioned the game does use traditional locomotion controls in contrast to the more commonly used teleport mechanic in many other VR games. I have not personally experienced nausea playing this game on the Vive, but others may be more susceptible to it with this form of movement.However, I have also opted not to use the game's controls for yaw rotation, instead physically turning for the same effect. It would be good if the controls for strafing and yaw rotation could be optionally disabled as sometimes I do accidently hit these functions accidently. It is worth mentioning that though the game lacks a teleport mechanic it does offer a plethora of other comfort mechanics such as comfort turning, and various static frames of reference that surround your character.Overall I have found this to be a fun game with a thrilling system of movement and attractive, colourful Wind Waker aesthetic. It is one of the more substantial offerings currently available for the VR launch, particularly for the Vive which at the moment has a lot of simple demos."

The levels are very open and expansive, with lots of variety to explore, and plenty of mini-goals throughout the levels to keep you engaged.  I can understand how this might make someone motion-sick, with the walking (not teleport) motion & swinging through the air.  But personally, I haven't felt a twinge of nausea, just a little disorientation at times.It has many Vive controller configurations to chose from to suit your taste & comfort, and some other options to help orient you in VR.  It's not fully room scale - your virtual character is rooted to a spot in the center of your play area, but you can walk around within it to get a look around.  You can end up slowly drifting off of your home spot, but there's a faint shadow where your virtual character is standing, or an optional 'home cage' around that spot, so that you can find your way back to the right position.  There's also a virtual ground plane which I don't find useful, but may help.My only complaint is that the level difficulty can be pretty uneven - it's easy enough to get around most of a level, but as you near the main goals, you end up falling a lot & trying again as you try to get your jumps, or the timing of your swings just right.  There are checkpoints, so you don't usually have to go too far back, but it can still get aggivating.Of all the $20 VR games I've purchased so far, this one has been the most engaging."

After 4 hours into the game I still get the odd feeling of vertigo (and I used to work at heights for a living).The scale of the levels is impressive, especially when seeing them in VR.At first some parts of the map seemed impossible to reach, and I found myself platforming and using the swing mechanic as a secondary measure.  Soon you begin to gain skill and find yourself reaching areas with confident jumps and swings (well most of the time).  The game demands this skill as you progress - and it is one of the games strengths; the skill advancent is one of the best. if not the best, i have experienced for a platform style game.The use of VR is amazing.  Using the Vive with the controllers soon becomes second nature, though I found that I needed the crosshairs on.

The spiderman-esque flying mechanism is very well executed with the vive controllers and it is quite thrilling swinging from tree to tree.  When you finally get yourself up to the top of a level and look down on the platforms that you were on only minutes ago, you can easily get lost in the world.  There are numorous paths you can take to get to your objective making replayability fun.  My only gripe with the game is that there looks like a story is being told as you start reaching objectives and getting collectables, but besides some very short animations to let you know that you made it to a checkpoint/end of level you will be sort of lost on what to do.

Having a set length to your ropes, however, had it's drawbacks.

The formula of flying with grapple hooks (memories of quake mods and tribes come flooding back) and exploring new heights with walljumps is something I find relaxing and rewarding. Using creative thought to tackle increasinlgy complex tasks with the simplicity of utilizing spatial awareness and flow all while listening to your favourite tunes is a match made in heaven.

But after reaching a point of which seems impossible on the first of those two im happy to know that I will have a substantial amount of hours left meticulously and drunktardedly jumping to my peril eventually completing one of the very best games I've played In VR so far.The potential of this game in open world adventures and multiplayer Ctf flag style is so ridiculous.

It's perhaps the best game I've ever played period, just for the sense of freedom and awe it brings.I've read the other comments, and see that it makes a lot of people sick or uncomfortable, so I was hesitant at first, but I felt none of that. A little vertigo when falling, but it's the good kind of vertigo that you go to the amusement park for.  I just finished my first session, which was about 6 hours long, and the only discomfort is in my feet from being on them for so long. People I know in real life have confirmed that they do get a bit sick, but I'm proof that not everyone will.Nothing I've experienced in any game thus far has been as purely awesome as tarzaning from tree to tree, climbing up to the top of a huge building, and freefalling from the top to swing from a branch on the way down.

I didn't play it in VR, though when I had an oculus beta I did try the demo on that.. tended to get motion sick quickly, but enjoyed itAnyhow, this time I just played on normal PC. Was very fun, I enjoyed the movement physics and after several hours play I was happily flinging myself up all kinds of surfaces to get to places I had no right to reach.The story is pretty much not there really. It felt very underwhelming and the titans (the giant robots) just seem there as a spectacle, rather than have any reason, or relation to much that I could see?So yeah, consider getting it if you just enjoy fun, physicsy parkour/platforming games. I got it at 75% off, for a bit under £4, which was a more than reasonable priceThe biggest reason for a mixed review however? Well, I was browsing the forum and found somewhat unsavoury information which would very well have made me not purchase the game had I have known it, with very bad practices from the Devs, involving filing copyright strikes unjustly against someone giving grappling hook tutorials. I don't support people who try and censor the internet as a matter of course generally.Still, this was 10 months ago, and if I'm being generous, it appears to have happened more or less when the game was being released across multiple platforms, amidst issues over prices being set wrong on playstation and all other stuff. Perhaps the high stress of the situation led to rash overreactions. They did reverse the decision and made a somewhat meek apology, but this was after a fair bit of community backlash, so that honestly doesn't show much either way as far as intent goes. I'd certainly want to keep an eye on their actions before I buy any future games from themAnyhow, thought I'd best mention for transparencies sake"

The grappling aspect...hoo boy, is it fun to just grapple onto stuff and swing around like Spiderman...my one tiny gripe is you can only hook onto bushes and tree leaves.I feel like the art style compliments the gameplay. Light-hearted cartoony, but not to the point of being silly. Like it gives off no sense of urgency, and makes you want to explore and take in the scenery. The music fits nicely as well.

One hour played and one refund request later, I must say I was wrong.  Neglecting the developers' serious immorality regarding the swing mechanic situation, let's do an honest review of this mediocre game:PROS:-Unbelievably gorgeous environmental design.  Breathtaking views, surreal temples and massive golems watching over the floating tree cities; it is incredible....Aaaaaand that's about it.  Besides the environmental design, it fell completely flat.CONS:-Grappling hooks reel in far too fast, making them ineffective as actual swinging grappling hooks, since within half a second of grappling something you've pulled yourself on to it.  It's cumbersome and annoying- not an effective swing technique.  Who the hell thought automatically reeling hooks was a good idea?-Despite the game's aesthetic, the game is EXTREMELY linear.  You have to hop a few platforms, grab a crystal, go back.  Open a new path, hop a few platforms, grab a new crystal, rinse and repeat.  Despite the illusion of a breathtakingly free floating city, each path you need to go down is all too straightforward.-Bad parkour:  You arbitrarily can do wall-jumps and wall-climbs, but they aren't good and don't work with the game's physics.-Movement physics: Why does the protagonist have such consistently massive inertia?  Even when you aren't swinging, your jumps can launch you like 50 feet in the air and you can jump half a frickin football field with a single (non-grapple-involved) leap.  Now I'm not even concerned about motion sickness, but the wonky and fake movement physics break the immersion sooooo badly.-Grapple limitations: Adding to the game's linearity even worse, the grappling hook has two debilitating flaws (in addition to the earlier mentioned reeling issue): Their reach distance is ridiculously short, and only hook to bushes.  Yes, you heard me right, they only hook on to bushes.  You can grapple other things on easy mode, but that also changes the rest of the game to make it easier, which I would not prefer.I was so excited to play this.  But what I learned is that this game's quality does not even come close to overlooking the controversy behind it.  Believe me- this game is NOT worth defying moral convictions for."

I still had the title on my Wishlist when I got my Vive picked it up on sale.  FWIW, as I write this, I'm only running a GTX 960 (which isn't certified for VR), yet Windlands still plays and looks great on my Vive.  No issues at all--so if you're sporting better hardware, I'm sure it'll be even more spectacular.Basically you just fly around like Spiderman, but instead of webs you use grappling hooks.  The hooks can only latch onto tree tops/bushes.  The goal is to collect runes/tablets/crystals...basically nonsense.  Any storyline is just artifice for swinging around way up in the air and figuring out how to get from one area to the next.The only thing I don't like about the game is that the motion control (with the Vive controllers) doesn't strafe.  You can only move forward/reverse--but that's just a minor nuisance.  The soundtrack is also amazing.  I sort of regret not picking it up as DLC...maybe someday.I have no idea how much fun this would be without VR, but with VR it's all kinds of awesome.

In Windlands the core mechanic comes from two grappling hooks that you can shoot by directing your gaze, one per trigger. Trees and bushes server as anchors, and by default these grappling hook pull you with quite a bit of force. The result is you are Spider Man, or have Attack on Titan's six axis gear. The sparce level design gives you ample room to swing in huge arcs, emparting incredible speed. It FEELS like you are swinging a 100 meter rope across the grand canyon, only to land at the peak of your swing with a gentle thump. The simple visual language means anchors are never hidden, and the immense scale of the game world works perfectly with it. Right now the focus is platforming and exploration, and that alone is a blast.

However, Windlands loses major points for its limited control customization and the general floatiness / slow response of the controls.I really think this game could benefit from more controller customization options. As it is, the presets are limited and none really feel satisfactory for me. In addition, the beginner control schemes are actually missing functions (extend/retract rope) that are critical to gameplay.The biggest issue I have with Windlands is the physics. There is a LOT of sliding around in this game, and changing direction is painfully difficult. This actually works well during segments where you can use your grappling hooks, as it makes everything feel very smooth and natural, but it makes platforming segments frustratingly difficult. It's far too easy to land on a platform, only to slide another foot and fall off.I really, REALLY want to like this game, but the only level that I could recommend in its current state is the first one, as the other two offer very few opportunities to use the grappling hooks, focusing instead on the miserable platforming.

I played a little before I got my Vive, then again after. I must say it's like 20x better with the Vive and probably not worth it without the Vive.Pros:-You get to feel like spider man, swinging around everywhere-You actually get a tiny adrenaline rush wooshing through the air-It's hilarious watching people nearly fall over when they ""land""Cons:-Not a big fan of the movement/jumping mechanics-If you land on the corner of something, you don't just fall down, you bounce backwards-Several non-tree playforming/few checkpointsOverall, I'd say it's definitely worth it. You need a lot of patience. I actually rage quit for about 2 weeks at the last objective of the first level because it was all jumping, but I went back in, did much better, and finished that objective. I feel like the devs missed the mark a little on this game. Between myself and my 3 brothers, we all agreed that the swinging through the trees was mind-blowing and the jumping without the trees was frustrating."

It's also incredibly difficult and has a few issues with its controls. But, if you enjoy a challenge and want to soar through the clouds, this is a game you can't miss.More than once I uninstalled it thinking I would never get past a certain part, only to eventually give in and try again with a new strategy that worked (usually after many more deaths). The main source of frustration comes from long strings of harrowing jumps/swings with no checkpoints in between them. The wall jumping especially As for the controls, the Vive support has improved immensely in the latest update, but there are still times when I had to switch back and forth to an xbox controller in order to tackle some of the platforming.On the other hand, swinging with the Vive controllers, especially once one gains some skill, is rapturous. The views and sense of scale are unparalleled and make all the effort to climb to the highest points in the game worth it. I can't imagine playing this without VR. Not only would many of the jumps be nearly impossible without being able to quickly look at your feet, but you'd be robbed of the reward of looking out at what you've conquered and really feeling like you're there. I'm not normally afraid of heights, but quite a few times this game sent a shock of terror through my spine when I looked down. Quite an experience.I do wish it were longer, but only because I was enjoying it much more by the end when I really knew what I was doing. For $20 it's a fine value considering it took me 12 hours to beat, whereas most VR games at that price have at best one or two simple repeating experiences which get tiresome quickly. Hopefully there is an expansion/sequel at some point.An addendum about motion sickness: I do not get motion sick in real life. However, the first time I played Windlands I was standing up and nearly fell over from dizzyness. I tried changing to seated mode and turning on the comfort cage in the settings. This alleviated about 90% of the discomfort, though I still felt quite a bit of leftover queasiness after my first couple play sessions. After that, the discomfort rapidly faded and I found I could turn the comfort cage off and perform big drops/swings that would have made me sick before. So, ""VR Legs"" are definitely a thing and I developed them pretty rapidly, but still I'd advise everyone to use discretion if they are prone to motion sickness."

I havn't even played the 3rd level and have been playing for nearly 6 hours. As i understand it there is also other content like challenges to do and I'm looking forward to trying it all, and for new content if it comes in the future.The soundtrack is beauitiful and atmospheric.I do not get VR sickness at all, so that was no a problem for me.I would recommend this to anyone with a VR headset."

Not to mention the level design is very poor and I often find myself confused on where to go next.This game captivated me with it's unique style and what appeared to be complex level design, causing me to believe they would allow me to get to the next checkpoint in the way I see fit. WRONG. There's 100 trees and you have to find the specific path the game wants you to take, otherwise you'll find yourself on top of a tree with nowhere to go. That is, if you can get on a tree. You'll usually need to ascend so if theres a tree above you that you want to get on you'll have to move your grapples up the side of the tree in attempt to mount it. It feels as if you're trying to get on top on an 8 foot bouy while you're in the water.

No comment on the developer one way or the other, this is 100% only my experience with the game:To start off I’m going to say this is one of the most nauseating VR experiences I’ve played.  The comfort cage can help, but the core gameplay has you moving quickly, constantly.  I personally was not bothered by this, but many friends I’ve shown had to take the headset off within 10-15 minutes, and a handful could not play at all.  People also frequently lost their balance after their first big jump, so make sure you have a good play area to work with.  You can play this game well enough sitting, which helps ome.    The control scheme could probably use some refining, but that’s true of 90% of VR experiences at the moment.   The ground movement in particular felt odd, but I can’t really think of how they would have done it differently.  Fortunately, you don’t spend a lot of time on the ground.That said, those are the only things I really felt were cons to the game.   It’s one of the few Vive games I’ve played that really filled the adventure feel that I’ve wanted out of VR, the immersion and sense of motion is amazing once you get moving, that is, once you get the hooks and don’t have to rely on the awkward ground movement.The difficulty settings are each a pretty big jump from one another, just messing around without a challenge is fun regardless given the novelty of this game.The graphics are nice looking but a little repetitive; at least in the couple of hours I’ve played so far.   It’s got a strong knock-off legend of Zelda aesthetic that many will find pleasing, but it doesn’t really take any huge risks in that department.  That said, everything looks better in VR and I was never disappointed or taken out of the experience by the graphics.Windlands stands out as feeling complete against a backdrop of VR experiences are short demos or incomplete feeling."

The ability to move around in the world without resorting to teleporting does take a little adjusting but it is well worth the inital dizziness it may cause.I heard people complaing this game made them sick, personally I would compare the feeling to what you might expect when riding something at an amusment park. It may make your stomach feel funny and throw your balance off but it also gives you a rush you probably haven't felt in a video game before. Being able to swing from tree to tree is such a neat experience that words can't do justice.Really my only real gripe with the game is I wish it had a bit more varitey in the landscapes. While they are beautiful to look at and explore, some other themed areas would make it more exciting. Still, this game is one I would consider a must have for any vive owner.

It's not obvious where to go (the dev disagrees and has said in the past ""Just follow the light. Duh!"" Sorry Dev, that's not good enough).The learning curve is very high. I constantly found myself trying again and again and again to get to new areas and failing. At some points thinking ""Can I do this now? Is there some upgrade I need to get here?""The movement controls feel very floaty and don't work well with clicking the Vive trackpads. The floatyness makes some of the jump puzzles infuriating.Despite all this... I really like this game. It has a very simple yet pretty aesthetic. The music is appropriate and relaxing. When you're in an area that has lots of bushes and trees it's so much fun swooping from tree to tree. I think that's why I find some parts of the game frustrating. A lot of the puzzles I've come across so far required accurate jumping with floaty movement when it's the swooping from trees that makes this game actually fun. You may feel the opposite though when you play it.I don't get motion sickness thankfully however I do feel a physical reaction to this game and it is AWESOME! When I free fall through the sky I feel it in my stomach and it makes me so giddy.

There was little to no story and the only thing that i found good about this game are the spider-man like physics.The island placement in the levels is pretty good but was hindered by how much slide there is on your character and how long it takes for your character to speed up when walking, which is how you start the game (with now grappling hooks).Also considering what happened between Fuseman (VR coding and tutorial youtuber) and Psytec (one of windlands devs), these devs think that just because they made a game based around a swinging mechanic means that they own that mechanic and no-one can know how to ocdes it.

It's a bad platformer, but it has the wowness of VR.  Once the wowness fades and you genuinely try to get through the game it becomes tedious.  Play it for no other reason than there is nothing else out there like it at the moment.  Let's hope they tweak the controls or add more checkpoints in a patch or something to make it easier.

You will curse the way the rather thorough physics engine means your momentum carries you off cliff edges at the slightest misstep, and subsequently come to love that same physics engine for the way you build up epic swings and launches. And even the most diabolical challenges (looking at you, Sky Challenge) are simply satisfying when you finally complete them.P.S. If you can play the game in VR, so much the better.

Very steep learning curve, and intensely punishing when you mess it up.

Which is generous in a way...Though, the difficulty in the controls is what keeps this game from being great. I could say that with about 80 more hours, I might be used to the controls enough to really enjoy it. The problem is that when you swing wrong, or bounce off a wall wrong, you get a lot of momentum, with little to no chance of correcting yourself. Any wrong move sends you careening into space. Also, if you land on a surface wrong, you're still somehow falling off - as you just don't stop moving (that's some pretty smooth concrete ;) ). I find myself walking around in several small circles for a few seconds before the character is standing still again. Of course, I could jump again... which helps in some cases. But as I said, the learning curve is very high, and easily frustrating. I'll try to play with a controller, and see if it gives me the same issues...Though, I put up with all of that because the world is really colourful and quite well made."

Initially I found it awfully frustrating because jumping feels very inaccurate and a couple of times it just throws a new mechanic at you without explaining it (seriously devs, maybe a mention that wall jumps are a thing if you're going to lock us in a room where the only way out is up)But then you get the grappling hooks, and goodness me, all of your Spider-Man fantasies just came true all at once. It feels absulutely amazing just flying around like an absolute crazy person. Then you get used to jumping (tip for new players: forward and back movement inputs allow you control in the air) and figure out how to climb up and around trees (you can jump up the side of stuff while you're attached with the grapples) and from there on in you're finding your way around the impressively expansive levels finding items and just having a ball.

The problem I have with it is that when walking around, you can only move in the direction you look, and it is *severely* unresponsive. I've played Minecraft in VR, using ViveCraft, and it is a far better control scheme. When walking around rather than teleporting (toggleable), you move in the direction you point your controller. Additionally, in Minecraft, the normal walking doesn't have  this amount of directional momentum. In Windlands, I have to keep stopping and moving, otherwise I end up not going the direction I wanted, and walk into a wall or off a cliff. It was like I was sliding on ice or something."

The levels aren't too hard, which makes for a nice light hearted journey.Now in VR, you take everything I've said so far and multiply it a hundred fold.The landscapes are simply mindblowing and the levels go from not to hard, to one of the most intense things you'll have experienced.Due to the natures of the VR itself, missing a swing goes from ""Ah man"" to ""AGGHGHHHHH"" in the most genuine way possible.

There is one problem, there are ice physics. This makes one of the part in the game super difficult, not by the part being hard to get past, but instead hard to control yourself on small platforms. To put it into better words imagine playing super mario world and you want to get to a secret area, but the only way to the secret is by jumping on to a single ice block that is over a lava pit. so the only thing that needs to be fixed is the slippery controls."

It is completely based around momentum which at start feels really slidey and a bit off. However you quickly realise it kinda makes sense because in real life when you start running forward and want to stop you don't just dead you kidna slow yourself down. Which is what the game done perfectly. Once you get into the game and after a little bit of practice you are swinging from tree to tree with ease. One major pointer is not to use both hooks all the time because using just one hook allows you to ""swing"" a bit better rather then being pulled directly into the object you're attached too. This is more of a first impression  kind of thing considering at the moment i only have just over 30 minutes on the game.edit: I have from what im aware actually already completed the game within the 30 minutes of playing it.

The only flaws i can find is the momentum and some of the platforming part you can't actually jump high enough to get to some of the areas you're supposed to be able to jump to. Maybe you should only slide on certain surfaces like the white surface and not the dirt and grass?

You go through a short introductory stage, get into the main hub, and go to world 1.  From there, you have to collect 3 artifacts within world 1 in order to unlock world 2.  The first 2 artifacts are fine.  They are not that bad to collect, which is how it should be considering you are still being introduced to the concept of the ropes and how to use them.

Who failed the Game Designing for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ course?  All of you?  Yeah that makes sense.Jesus Christ.  I want to like this game.  I like the first 2 artifacts.  The gameplay is challenging but fun.  With some practice, everything can flow very smoothly.  The last artifact before unlocking the next world is like a giant middle finger to the player.  The slightest misstep means falling a mile and a half to your death.  In a recent update, they did make a few more checkpoints, but then they also changed the last few jumps to get to the last artifact in world 1.  The platforming in this section is INCREDIBLY awkward.  It is extremely aggravating (in case you couldn't tell from my rant).  And it makes the game not worth playing.  And this is coming from someone who plays and enjoys platforming games.  I have been through over 70 brutal hours of Super Meat Boy, and that is not including the 100+ hours I spent in it on Xbox, along with plenty of other platforming games.  The platforming in this game is loose, it slides around, it's awkward, it takes ages to get something right, it is just generally bad.  So that leaves my utterly confused as to why the developers thought it was a good idea to strip the player of the thing that makes this game good, and leave them with only the bad.  Most people will get too frustrated and quit before passing world 1.Not worth $20Not worth $10Maybe worth $5"

This locomotion-by-button takes some getting used to. It's intense. It's unnatural. But the feels of swinging from tree limb to tree limb a la Spiderman is very rewarding and a ""Must-get"" title if you have a Vive.So enough praise, time for some critical thoughts: I'm still learning how to combine movements.  The game expects you to combine movements immediately. Example: Swing-let go-swing-let go-disregard that your vision shows you 2k feet to your death below because you can't die and respawn with a button press-jump-walljump-swing. That's the beef I have with this game. There is NO VR kiddie pool. Hell, the 3rd map is a speedrun with global players listed on a leaderboard where every time you respawn it silently mocks you with it's 1st place at 1 min 45ish seconds. At over 15 min. with the clock still running I was exhausted and ended my run finding 8 of the 10 holy golden balls. With a final look at the leaderboard, I said peace out for now.I understand that given this was a game designed initially for 2d/controllers that the difficulty is cranked up higher than expected in VR. It definitely is a case study for challenge vs frustration in the emerging VR development space of what movement combinations should be asked of the player to excel in a game in its first chapters or levels. I worry what it must be like to complete this game's final areas if I get that far.That beef said, as of today there's nothing like it. I'll be back attempting to swing from tree-mountain-island to another soon enough again, or more likely trying to climb to the top of a tree with the controllers in what must look like standing dog paddling to my roommates."

I've been following this game since it's first demo was released, and it continuously gets better.  While the original demo focused on free-form exploration, this version blends in much more intense platforming sections while still encouraging you to creatively tackle each objective.The only real downside at the moment is that the game seems to stutter noticeably when too much is on the screen. Each indivdual section of the main map consistently gets 90 FPS, but looking accross the map(an awesome view) can introduce a significant amount of judder.

For being in early access, the game is beautiful, complete with wonderful graphics, detailed maps, and a great soundtrack. It does however, have a few bugs, but they don't really detract from the overall feeling (if anything, they only make the game more challenging).The grappling hooks took me a little bit to get used to, but once I got the swing of things (pun definitely intended), I found it easy to jump from tree to tree. It would be nice however, if you could grapple on to grass or wood as opposed to just the leaves of trees and bushes. Most of the time, this wasn't an issue, with the exception of the tower in world one.On that same subject, the tower in world one proves to be extremely challenging, as it's all platform based as opposed to using your grappling hooks. I don't think this would be too much of an issue, but a few bugs make it almost impossible to complete. The physics are a bit off when you try to come to a short stop, as I came sliding forward a few times like I was on ice. There's also an issue on some of the platforms where there are little divets. Whenever I tried to take a running leap, I would sometimes get stuck in said divets, and not perform the intended jump.But like I said before, I was forgiving knowing that the game is in early access. It's still a complete blast to play, and I could honestly spend hours exploring around the maps.

The swinging is undeniably the best part of it, but the locomotion can be frustrating.PROS-Swinging is very well done and feels natural, especially if you ever played a Spiderman game (or the fanmade Attack on Titan game by Fenglee).-The soundtrack is very relaxing.-The environments are beautiful in VR, even with the low-quality style the game has.-When you have traverse the maps by swinging, the game usually gives you a lot of freedom. I found myself planning what paths I was going to follow and what moves/manoeuvers I was going to make, all in my head, while I was in mid-air.-There controls take a little getting used to, but there are some options to make them simpler or more complicated, for more complex movements, as well as for more comfort.CONS-While the swinging parts are amazing and give you a lot of options, the parkour parts are not. In order to minimize motion sickness, the running is accelerated instead of constant. Whenever you land somewhere you slide a little bit. This would be no problem if it weren't for the game's undying passion for thin planks and small floating rocks. More often than not I would land and slide off the tiny platform I was meant to reach in order to progress.-The jumping parts are also usually linear, with only one path to follow.-There is no grabbing ledges. As a result, many times I would almost reach a platform with my feet, but instead I would hit the ledge with my knees, thus bouncing back and falling to my death.-There is little to no text in the game. It took me a while to understand I was at the hub, and more to understand how the hub even worked. The story is also either confusing or non-existant, I'm not sure... (edit: they have added narration and subtitles now)CONCLUSIONWindlands can be extremely frustrating when the cons work together to make some platforming sections particularly hard, A few more checkpoints here and there would make it much less of a chore. (edit: they have added more bushes and the ability to grapple any surface)Still, the swinging parts are fantastic. As a fan of Spiderman, Attack on Titan, and those swinging metalbenders from the Republic City Police in Legend of Korra, I had been wishing for a game like this for a long time. And Windlands delivered.If you like swinging, or want something different from all the other VR wave survival games or small room interactive games, get this game. Don't buy it if you tend to quit when games become too difficult though.EDITThe game has been updated to include Easy and Normal modes, which allow you to grapple any surface (not just bushes/trees) and add more bushes/trees respectively. This is bound to greatly reduce the frustration I talked about earlier. They have added narration and subtitles for the story too. So now I feel confident in saying GO BUY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE A VIVE"

76561198029579791,Recommended,428370,23742954,"Posted: 23 June, 2016",all,Siegfoult,"This is a review for the Vive experience.  This game is challenging and fun, also has beautiful graphics and art style as well as very pleasant music.  I do not get motion sick in VR but I am afraid of heights, and this game always leaves me feeling shaky and sweaty.  However I consider this game a welcome addition to my Vive catalogue becuase it is not a wave based shooter, so it overs some much needed variety at this stage.  All in all I would recommend it for anyone who likes platformers and does not get motion sick in VR.  (To find out if you get motion sick in VR, I recommend trying Spell Fighter VR because it's free and also has artificial movement).Tip: do not make the mistake I did and fall into the habit of trying to climb trees, instead try to keep your momentum going by just using the trees as points to swing from.  If you end up landing, use wall jumps to get your momentum going again.Edit: I gotta change my positive review to a negative one, because I am not enjoying the game anymore.  Many parts are just too hard for me, and although I understand that frustrating levels is part of the core platformer experience, the small amount of vertigo I get makes me only want to play the game in 15-20 minute increments, which is often not enough for me to get to an objective, perhaps because I'm not very skilled at the game.  I wish there was an easy mode with a quick save option.  So now I would only recommend this game to people who like hardcore platformers.Edit: the developer added lower difficulties and some new Vive control schemes that allow for easier walking and better rope control, but have an awkward unnecessary turning mechanism.  I'll change this review to positive and re-review once I've played it more."

There are multiple controller configs to help with that though. But check it out for an hour, if you can't get over the feelings, click the refund button. However, DO NOT say, ""ya it's no big deal, I can handle it,"" because you'll develop negative VR-associations and burnout.Assuming you can get past that though, this game is much better on the Vive. I played it back on the Oculus DK2 and my neck was killing me having to constantly look up to aim with my gaze while clicking an Xbox controller button."
,Recommended,428370,25735625,"Posted: 27 September, 2016",all,extropy,"my first review, after a few days' play: [playing on a VIVE]aargh this game is a brilliant concept and lovely graphics, but ruined for me by being almost completely unplayable... just too damn uncontrollable.. the controls seem inconsistent, you cant tell how big a jump is going to be, and half the time the button on the controller doesnt work (??) -  the grappling hooks dont have enough 'pull', the easy setting is no easier than standard, there should be far more respawn points it is just too frustrating redoing the same section n times.....and now, after two weeks' play:no, I was wrong -  it really is amazing - once you get the controls sorted out. You need 'advanced ropes' OFF, cos that means they have no pull; and you need to start on EASY, where you can grapple any surface. And once you get used to it, the sense of soaring through the air is fantastic! - and keeps pulling you back..."
,Recommended,428370,24085337,"Posted: 4 July, 2016",all,Brünnehilde,"[Vive] This game does not make me sick at all, I've played for hours. 2 of my friends also played, my girlfriend was sick within 15 minutes.All that aside - I love the core idea behind this game. It's the VR game I keep coming back to. But I do hate being forced to do the jump challenges.Pros:- Swinging from tree to tree is an amazing experience- It's stable and smooth gameplay- Even when soaring at high speed it reacts like you'd expectCons:- By far the worst; the jumping mechanics! This is so awful it is the main reason I'm writing a review. I love the game, but damn I wish we could stick to the core of what makes the game good; the grappling hooks. The jumping puzzles in the game are beyond frustrating in VR. The controls don't help. Honestly it's just such a dumb aspect to the game. Stick with what makes it good. I'd much rather just delete all the BS jumping mechanics out of the game and have a beautiful experience swinging around even if it means less ""gameplay""- The controls in VR always show the tooltips, eventually you learn to ignore it, but the UI/UX is a bit annoying there. Same with the menus, very dodgy and needs the workflow to be simplified for VR- The maps/textures/level playability would benefit a TON if you just hired just one guy who was concerned with UX, the level design is so frustrating sometimes, going from easy and fun swinging challenges into near impossible and incredibly frustrating jump challenges is no fun.- Levels were clearly designed with different mechanics available and need to be re-imaged for the Vive- Grappling hooks seem just a tad short, it would be much more fun to have them longer so I can build up even more speed more quickly.Conclusion:Game devs... please hire someone who has some idea about level design and user experience. This could be such a killer Vive game if you focused on the good parts. (levels with mostly just grappling, bigger more spread out levels with longer grappling hooks and higher speed swinging, clear objectives with a skill ramp that makes sense as the user progresses)Side note: I used to love climb and bhop levels in CS, I played them for days. But this in not the platform for it. Honestly you've got something so great with the grappling. Just focus on the good part and stop forcing us to wade through the BS of jump challenges with a system that doesn't have great physics (at least double up your vertices in areas where jumping is going to be important, the amount of times I've ""slid"" off an edge that I was clearly standing on is irritating)Otherwise great work on an awesome game!"

(MAY)I find the walking around is not very intuitive at all, feels too clunky for soemthing thats supposed to give you a lot of freedom. the fact that you have no control adjustments while you are in the air causes many unnecessary instances where you just fall off the map.If you just lazily stand up in this game and dont have you 'vr legs' you may want to be careful because you may just fall on your A**.I did not get sick, however, I can totally see how many people can get sick in this game.either way it offers an experience that most other games do not, which is why I still recommend this game, albeit with a healthy warning for motion sickness or because you may just fall over while playing this..be careful! :d"

I'm recommending it anyway.If you get motion sickness from it, don't play it for too long in a single session. Go do something else and come back a few hours later or the next day. DON'T try to ""power through it"" as you could make your motion sickness worse both for Windlands but worse still, when using VR in general.Just gradually build up tolerance for walking without walking, jumping 5 meters in the air with a button press, and falling 15 storeys seemingly unharmed."

That being said the game is amazing! If you want to feel like Spider-man, or Bionic Commando, this is the game for you. I am personally very afraid of heights, and I think this game is helping me conquer that fear! When I started playing in VR, I had to sit on the floor to keep my balance and reduce my anxiety. After a while I graduated to a spinning chair. Frustrations with the Vive's cable tangling finally forced me to stand, and I've been soaring ever since. I still get weak in the knees sometimes when making a tough jump or looking down, but that's all part of the fun! Now pardon me while i go wipe the sweat off my controllers."

The artificial locomotion via the touchpad is the cause, but I get why the devs stuck with it. A platformer with teleportation would've been kinda pointless.If you get nauseous quickly, this might not be the game for you. But thanks to steam refunds, you can give it a try and return it, if it's uncomfortable.I'll definitely keep it. *makes spiderman gesture and flies away*"

If anyone is confused on how to get the oculus one you can look it up online and get a key for the oculus store. although you still have to buy the game and have it in your library to do so.
,Recommended,428370,34755854,Posted: 5 September,all,DarkCheddar,Dissappointed by the oculus touch support. You have to click the stick in order to move (which is fine on the vive). It's not a gamebreaker but makes controls a lot harder. Still a fun game though.
