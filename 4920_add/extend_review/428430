Well, all you need is GameMaker and thisPlatformer Roguelike Engineasset from YoYo Games' marketplace for$33.99ONLY $16.99. Now all you need to do is doodle over the default sprites and recolor the tiles a bit and you're done!Original review follows:tl;dr:Do you recommend this game?No:it's unoriginal, even taking into account the early stage of developmentthere are a lot of issues, that not ""early development"" issues, but rather just plain lazy things (all graphics look blurry due to using the wrong texture filter, etc.)it's someone's first attempt at a game in Game Maker, and while there's nothing wrong with Game Maker, the inexperience shows clearlythe developer feels shady (deleting discussion threads, recommending their game on their curator account, moderating the forums under a different steam profile etc.)some features reported in Greenlight all the way back in November are still missing from the game.If you feel the game looks promising, instead of buying it now, follow the game and see where it goes once it develops, but I'd definitely recommend against buying at this stage.Actual reviewEndorlight is a dungeon platformer that's clearly heavily inspired by Spelunky. Your goal is to navigate short levels from the top to the bottom, find an exit and procede to the next randomly generated level. There are enemies, spikes and pick-ups on the way, and beyond what you'd expect from any platformer game you have wall-hugging, wall jumping, a horizontal ranged weapon and two different melee weapons. There are three tilesets fro the game, the third of which is used for every level beyond level 3, and five or six enemies, most differing only in their appearence, speed and hitpoints.The game is in early alpha, but even taking that into account, the concepts the game presents feel unoriginal, and the game has a bunch of issues, that result from laziness or incompetence with the engine (Game Maker) including a very wonky control configuration system, blurry look due to using the wrong type of scaling filter on the sprites and tiles and UI issues (item's drawing over oneanother etc.)The game is also VERY easy. There are way too many health pick-ups littered throughout the  levels and the enemies are too easy to dodge most of the time. I usually give new games a change of one game over or one hour if there are a lot of deaths, in the one hour that I played Endorlight, I made it to level 159 or something, had so many health-upgrades that they covered my gold total, and finally died because I started playing one-handed while playing Trivia Crack on my phone. The game feels less like an alpha or pre-alpha, and more like an ""engine test"", but given that it's using Game Maker, I'd say the engine has already been quite thoroughly tested. I'd say the biggest challenge the game provides stems solely from the controls feeling laggy (not floaty, I actually enjoy some inertia in my platformer controls, but actually laggy) and the various small glitches (there are two shoot buttons, both fire where the character is facing, except if your standing next to a wall, in which case the character fires away from the wall).The game is in early development, but in my playthrough, I never once encountered many of the features advertised on the games Greenlight page way back in November including the Digger enemy, the knife weapon or any inventory.Outside the game, Endorlight has been Recommended by four curators, one of which has more than 10 subscribers. That one beingVantom's Giveaways, whose admin -vantom- is the user who submitted Endorlight to Steam Greenlight. The recommendation doesn't do anything to disclose this. Make of that what you will.The developer also seems to delete discussion threads without any explanation or reason. They are using a wonderful PSD template from Designercow's  awesome80's Style Text Mockupspack, available on Envato's graphicriver store. I pointed out that they've made a small mistake when customizing the mockup, forgetting to move the glow/flare ""blobs"" to overlay on the logo's stroke outline, resulting in a weird look. The thread was summarily removed without explanation.So, in closing. If this game interests you, I'd recommend checking out the free Game Maker version of Spelunky instead, it has a similar aesthetic, but offers much more to discover and is a very polished game. If nothing but Endorlight will do, unless you're a personal friend of the developer, I'd hold off on buying until at least the features that were supposedly already implemented during the Greenlight phase are realized...Video demonstrating some of the menu issues, and a few gameplay clips to illustrate the monotony of the gameplay."
,Recommended,428430,26178024,"Posted: 23 October, 2016",all,Sweep,"The Game EndorlightIn this game, your main objective is to reach the door in the last area. You'll have 3 weapons in total: a whip, an axe, and a bow which has unlimited uses. There will be monsters which will prevent from you going to the last door, and you can die from them. Also, you'll have to restart from scratch if you die. You can see a minimap in the top left which is kinda hard to see to help you through the game. There are also some treasures lying on the floor, which either act as treasure chest or simply as a pouch. The treasure will give you gold, which i never find out the uses. There seem to be endless level ""farming"" in this game, with each floor will have a stronger enemy. However, i feel that the enemies damage are too high while the main character has no way of recovering HP.There is a health container which will raise your maximum HP by one. However, it's not carried to the next stage.Because you'll mostly just dodge the enemies and kill the boss, you'll get bored of this game quicky.GraphicsAll sprites and UIs in game looks very similar to Platformer Roguelike Engine, which means that if the devs use the said engine, they only use default sprites.There is a main menu in this game, although it looks very simple and brief. Luckily, the menu is easy to understand. However, you can't mute the game unless by opening the menu when the game starts.All in All Endorlight is a very nice Retro-Style Game.9/10 From MeSweep"

That being said, I want my 70 cents back.Endorlight hardly qualifies as a game-it's more like an unfinished student project. The logo looks slick, as does the main menu screen, but the pixel art lacks spirit and uniqueness. The gameplay is laughable. The exit for the next level is nearly in the same location every time. The whip weapon doesn't work. There are jewels and chests to oepn, but what purpose do they serve other than scoring points? Am I supposed to score points? Can I use these points to buy upgrades for my crappy, non-functional weapons?I can see this game being fun with more work- but the developers need to tie up loose mechanics and give the players incentive to progress through levels."

The Bosses Are Also Crappy Each Boss Can Be Defeated Instantly Because You Just Need To Rapid Fire Your Bow. This Game Is Not The Crappiest Game I Ever Played. Far From It But, I Still Hate This Game. The Only Good Thing I Can Say About It Is That My Controller Actually Works With It. By The Way Dev Why Don't You Actually Sell Something You Made It Kind Of Annoys Me That I Have Spent 80 Hours On Programming A Game And I Haven't Even Gotten Close To Finishing It But YOU Just Buy Some 20 Dollar Rogue Like Product For Game Maker (I Think Its Game Maker I Don't Remember) And End Up Selling Something That Someone Else MADE.

,Recommended,428430,20639550,"Posted: 20 January, 2016",all,Yeti,"tl;dr: Absolute tons of potential and a simple design for a very nice price. Right this second, it's still worth the price tag to kill a boring afternoon.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzDWWibyUrIIt's difficult to review Endorlight when its so early in development, but I feel like this is a game people should really take a look at - especially for the price. It's too simple to complain about anything, and since this is ""pre-alpha"" and it's hard telling when this review's being read, I'll try to just touch on the current foundation that's laid and speculate on the potential of what the game could be. On the tin it looks like another indie platformer with permadeath but that's not accurate at all.While the levels are currently short and compact, they're randomly generated on every floor. The monsters, traps, crates, chests - everything. In the future this completely random level generation can bring on some really interesting layouts rather than just a sea of magma with platforms to jump across. The character's wall-jump ability makes it seem like we could see some very vertical and challenging levels and boss fights as we go further, and with certain enemies exploding on death and taking out terrain it's possible to dig (or explode via planned bomb weapon) your way through. I imagine this goes for the enemies, too (planned digger enemy). With all the variety, some levels might be a sort of ""race to the finish"" because of falling platforms (planned feature) and how many enemies there are at the start (a load of baddies led by a digging enemy as the fuse?) while other levels require a bit more finesse and tactical jumping to get through unharmed. While you could just rush toward where you think the exit is (it's not made obvious by the map - probably intentional) you'd be hurting yourself in the long-run with all the missing loot. Enemies don't currently drop anything, but crates and chests are strewn about the levels and give gold upon destruction.Gold currently has no use, but it's pretty obvious this is intended to be currency for the yet-to-be-introduced shops. I imagine shops will be selling heart containers for more life, potions to heal you, arrows for the bow (surely it's not always infinite ammo?), ammo for the gun (planned weapon), bombs (also planned weapon), etc. Taking your time and saving your gold as you progress can be difficult on some levels due to the layout and enemies, but would be worth it. I'd like to think the shops will be alone on their own level to prevent a player from seeing a shop and THEN wanting to full-clear to afford the wares. While this isn't a major thing, it'd be nice to see some reward / punishment for different playstyles. Hauling it through every level to get deeper may have its benefits (maybe?) but taking your time yields shop goodies, but at the risk of losing your life to the enemies that are everywhere.The enemies are really simple currently. You standard slime with raptor-like capabilities regarding its jump, the thing that blows up on death, green, uhh... things that aren't really that aggressive, etc. They vary by appearance but the general premise is the same - don't get touched by one. It's dangerous to use your melee weapons so the bow it a great go-to (unless the terrain is really bumpy as you can't aim vertically and there's no arrow drop or ""charging"" the bow for adjusting trajectory) but at the cost of arrows, which are currently infinite. The melee weapons might double as tools, but right now there's nothing to tool. A gun, hatchet, and bomb are planned weapons so it's hard to tell what the enemies (and bosses) will be like, but it sounds like staying at range is the way to go."
