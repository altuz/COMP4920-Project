A bit of fine tuning and it could turn in to a little diamond and it's a very respectable effort from an indie developer and at the current tag of $9.99 I think it's fairly priced and offers some value for money. It can only be a thumbs up for that reason."

I'm hoping that they are fixing those.I support Indie efforts and hope that they continue to fix the game. Please fix the vehicle damage & geometry popping in larger levels. Some soldiers shoot through the walls in Bunker so that needs to be fixed as well.

I appreciate the fact there are cutscenes and that they hired actors for their game. However dont expect a AAA game as its more of a B-title.It is one of these games that is funny to play.Repurchased the game after I refunded and saved 10$.Thanks for listening developer. It is the first time I see a developer lower his price after release and  after reading customer reviews.6.9/10.*****************************UPDATED REVIEW*********************************************A very expensive slaughtering grounds/Into the Dark kind of game with very sexy actresses.Feels like they all used the same game engine or something (FPS Creator? or Unity?)The Good:....? Very sexy actresses. I got to give you that. Like the effort put into that.The Bad: The price and everything else. Very buggy game. Weird animation, Poor AI ; enemies walk through barrels and lock on you kind of like slaughtering grounds or into the dark. Falling off buildings.Short levels. Familiar gun sounds and the list goes on.I enjoy playing bad games but not at this price point maybe at 7.99 or less.Will change my review to thumbs up when price is on par.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGUvEb7TCYY&feature=youtu.be"

I would not have paid the $24.99 price.Hit detection isn't as terrible as everyone is saying it is. The lack of control of video options is surprising.If the developer keeps fixing bugs at the rate they ahve been doing this could shape up to be a pretty decent game.
76561197976335887,Recommended,428440,23606301,"Posted: 16 June, 2016",all,[-ODU-] afogl001,"This is the kind of game I've been hoping would start coming out, especially for GNU+Linux.  It's a straight forward, ""linear"" shooter with a story and atmosphere.  Granted, it needs a little polish, but the essentials are there, i.e., shooting, a story, and no time spent (read ""wasted"") playing around with perks, weapon mods, or special abilities.  AAA titles are getting so long in dev-cycle and so complex with distractions that are NOT game-play, that they make me appreciate games like this.  I hope the dev team stays with it and smooths out the rough edges, but for someone who is tired of playing shooters that make you choose how to spend your 500xp or muzzle-attachment weapon mod every five minutes, give this game a go.  After finishing the game, the three things I hope they work on are; melee weapon hit area (essentially, damage is done only in the center screen, as if using a gun), enemy spawn (thankfully no re-spawning, but sometimes they do spawn right behind you), and vehicle mechanics (though the quirkiness of them does lend to a bit of fun, like try driving a Humvee up a cliff or ram full speed into an enemy tank).  All those issues aside, it's a fun three hours of game play."

,Recommended,428440,22487620,"Posted: 17 April, 2016",all,Grenadeh,"Wot? Mostly positive? I guess the hate train didn't find this game yet. It's not terrible. It's actually one of the more solid indie FPSes on Steam that isn't the same old generic arena shooter crap. And that ridiculous live action dialog between and during levels reminds me of Resident Evil, rofl.Obvious glitches due to whatever engine this is and some things could use rebalancing, but hey the soundtrack is spot on. The story offers no explanation what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on, ever, from the very beginning, and the levels are more or less short, but I think this game could turn in to something. Apparently there's an event that happens with all these parallel Earths and so you and your team of college theater students have to investigate them for course credit :)From a technical standpoint, the game seems very stable, more or less. Driving HUMVEEs is jacked up and there are no physics to it though. You can walk through walls sometimes and walk through doors. Occasionally I have encountered glitches where if you fail or die, a door that was opened right when a checkpoint saved will not be open and cannot be opened, but you can glitch through it or pick quest items up through a wall.The gunplay is more or less solid. There are some issues with insane recoil on the M4, and the MP5 model appears to be a Colt SMG as far as you can see, but the only weapon related issues with guns are that sometimes if you are trying to hide behind a wall, there is an invisible hitbox on the wall that stops you from shooting through where you obviously should be able to - something that has pretty much disappeared from game design in the past decade. Other than that the Titan boss moves way too fast and can hit you even when you are inside buildings, and occasionally the nail bat doesn't hit at all, but it's otherwise seemingly functional.The developer seems to be working on the game on a regular basis, as well, so that's always a good sign.I do have to say this though: why does every sci-fi shooter have to take place in Russia? The game description acts like ""This game takes place all over the world."" No it doesn't. It takes place in Russia. Not only that, but in the most overused stereotypical part of Russia possible - Ukraine and Chernobyl. Yea, I get it, Ukraine and Afghanistan are their own countries now. They are still basically Russia.  Pripyat, Chernobyl, Afghanistan, Ukraine, come on man - all Russia or former Russia."

,Recommended,428440,28473559,"Posted: 19 December, 2016",all,nxshxs,"Chasing Dead is like a B movie with alot of A rate ideas if they were executed well. . Start with the very cool plot of starting off being escape pod dropped toward a planet and mistakenly the pod crashes into a 747 type passenger jet where you start your fighting. you have to gain control of the jet by first taking out all the zombies. Problem. The alien guarding the pilot cabin is difficult to discern. its like a mirage that lightly distorts the visual field when in your presence.The big blems are that when you kill the zombies , they fragment like old school virtual reality tank v tank renderings. Theres a few less quality angles like that that put a  limit to enthusiasm.  On the otherhand . for 10$ , not too shabby and a decent play. Oh yeh, theres a hospital. this is a scene where i've gotten alot more scared than any other game ever offered for 4x the cost.  The floating security drones are cool,  Its like Roger Wilco Pentium 2  bad cough medicine trip with formidable play for what you spent. The video footage of being updated of the missions is not great quality but in the theme of the game itself seems to be very realistic. AND the alien headquarters underground is similar to dead space  with better lighting and humanish guards to attack as well. The variety of species for this thing is pretty good.  can drive  tanks, can outwit unusually large aliens that would otherwise cheaply stomp you with 4 story legs. The thing towers over the deserted town.  merely ok automated threat, and assortment of weapons and take some time to get familiar with reloading and swapping/ unloading weapons  buttons.. Truly a game needing a learning curve for budget entertainment. Still tho .. for ten bucks you get $19 of game."

The environment is big so you'll have more open when fighting zombies and mutants.The weapons in this game is pretty good, not alot but its fairly good.Interesting boss fights.At some point, you get to ride the tank, something you dont usually see in a zombie apocalypse.Cons:The ending, leading to ""to be continued"" with a cliffhanger even though I wish it could have ended it with a bang, but its not THAT big of a deal though. So dont mind this.The control of the tank, while its fun to ride a tank the controls suck. I had a hard time getting used to it and still not used to it after beating the game. I had to do some strategy since the tank is pretty much invincible when you get off the tank. And if you get on later, it instantly regenerates.Subtitles are extremely inaccurate, you can easily tell if you listen to their voices and read the subtitles at the same time. Most of a time its way off. You can have a protagonist saying ""Roger that"" with a subtitle that said ""Will do"". Thats how bad it is.Overall:As I said above, its a decent game. Its primarily focused on missons and it tends to be short. There is no saves but it can save your progress once you beat that level, you can tell with its statistics coming up. Theres checkpoints as well if you die and you get those checkpoints by reaching to your objective, only loss is your weapons you've obtained and you may either stick with your default weapons or no weapons depending on the level. While it is short when it comes to missions, but theres many which is enough for you to entertain."

Sometimes you know that a game is going to be mediocre or even downright suck, but you get in your thicker than a concrete block noggin that you're going to play it and the lord protect the man, woman or beast that tries to stop you.  The horror bug bit me in the early 80s at three years old; first with movies and then with video games in the earlier half of the 90s.  Eventually, I'll get around to seeing every movie, playing every game, etc. that relates to the genre.At $20+ Chasing Dead was not even tempting for me to buy.  I more or less knew what I was going to get, so I waited till the price dropped considerably.  $9.99, hey cool, at least I won't kill myself with Burger King or some other garbage with those couple of dollars...harm reduction my friends.  So, I picked this up to plow through another zombie shooter.  From the fantastically terrible Land of the Dead to the entertaining Zombi on Wii to the top down slaughterhouse magic of Splatter...I give 'em all a try.  So, I laid down my digital cash and spent a night n' a half with Chasing Dead.First up, this game isn't going to take you long to beat.  On the hardest setting (glitches and horse manure included) it took me roughly 4 1/2 hours to finish spread across a day and a half.  I could see people rounding up the torches, rope and a tree for a good Wild West hanging if they spent $24.99 on this mess.  Yeah, Chasing Dead is a mess.  It's a kinda trashy, MILDLY fun B movie/exploitation mess at that, but gamers looking for a gory, well-made time waster won't be having this for dinner.You play as action movie cliche soldier, Jake, a lousy one-liner spoutin', gun in each hand Duke Nukem wannabe if there ever was one.  Ol' Jake kicks off his adventure on a crashing plane and makes a rough landing on doppelganger version of Earth where zombies, ogre lookin' boss idiots, flying robot drones, renegade soldiers and other lunkheads all want to kill you.  Simply put, you'll mow down foes with a decent selection of guns, clear the planet of hostiles level by level and accomplish standard mission objectives along the way.  It's a simple formula borrowed from a million other shooters before it, but Chasing Dead gets the bare minimum job done in this respect.The environments on Earth Vol. 2 are pretty crappy looking.  Graphics are not this game's strong suit and you've seen better modeled monsters and level design in just about any similar horror game you can think of.  It's suitable but it's not pretty.  On a souped up Alienware PC things didn't run smoothly; framerates were crapping out during heavily populated frays and boss battles which got more annoying than Chinese water torture the more I played.  Ontop of that hit-detection is poor with Jake's shooting on par to a blind man without glasses trying to get a ringer in an afternoon game of horseshoes.  You'll blast enemies in the head and they either won't go down (most likely registering hits somewhere else on their bodies) or completely whiff.  Prepare to die a few cheap deaths, although the game itself isn't impossible in difficulty, so it won't hold you back too often.  Audio doesn't fare any better with cheesy, stock beastie groans n' grumbles and bosses that sound like they are more likely to tickle your feet with a feather than beat you to a bloody pulp.  A nondescript soundtrack, terrible voice-acting (sometimes hilarious) and lightweight weapon FX give the game's presentation all of the sharpness of a dull Ginsu that can't even slice a tomato.  As stated the cutscenes are done FMV style like an old adventure game which makes no sense whatsoever other than adding to the B-movie stink that permeates every poor of this game.  Most scenes are acted in the dark with the actors/actresses looking down READING DIRECTLY FROM THE SCRIPT.  It's hysterical at first but this kind of cheese is best reserved for a movie.  You'll be reaching for the skip button quick.  My favorite parts are whenever the actors have to get up to run from something that suddenly ""smoked out"" their location.  The whole spiel is the kinda bad they don't make a name for.Bad animation seeps into the gameplay with the aforementioned FPS dips and rotten hit detection.  This can be correct somewhat if you zoom in with the ironsights but nothing is a science in this game.  Most of your enemies are dumber than dirt and you'll progress via firepower overload alone.  Jake can carry two weapons at anytime and there's a nice selection.  Zombies fall pretty easily and are generally wimps even on the hardest setting which will turn off anybody looking for a stiff challenge and a frequent checkpoint system makes sure you won't fall behind too far if you do happen to die.  To Chasing Dead's merit the later levels are a bit more fun and less generic (than the standard worntorn wastelands, abandoned industrial complexes, etc.) later on; a ghost town, haunted mansion, a firefight inside and atop a fast-moving train, and a few other interesting locales helping to break up the monotony a bit.  Floating wraith enemies add a little spice here, at the trade of the player's wits when pitted against infuriating invisible opponents in the haunted mansion (they go down in three hits and you can find a scanner to detect their presence...still, with aiming and shooting as sh*tty as it is, you're gonna want to take a shotgun to your monitor).A handful of sinister boss enemies stand in your way.  I'm sure the developers wanted to think they are sinister but most of them are mutants that look like goofy trolls/ogres as opposed to zombies.  They are wide targets, so even the wonky mechanics won't impede you from mowing them to bits.  Again, the sluggish gameplay quirks and imprecise controls will probably get you murdered during the first mutant boss at least once until you find a way to work around them.  That's the entire problem with Chasing Dead's 3-5 hour campaign; imprecision...a lack of polish or even the slightest bit of refinement to even the most rudimentary gameplay elements.  Oh yeah, you also get to command a Hummer and a Tank in a few levels...the Hummer will probably go down in the history of gaming as the worst vehicle in a shooter on any platform during any era.  It's THAT futtbucking godawful.  You'll want to commit suicide before the first mile.  For honesty's sake, the tank controls better and at least you can tackle the opposition with firepower as opposed to the Hummer's solitary ""run 'em over"" attack.There's a few Steam achievements for those into that sort of thing and getting eight of them was enough for me.  Despite it's cheapness due to bad design, if you do play Chasing Dead go straight to Hard because it's not really that tough for the seasoned shooter vet.  I consider myself above-average and I had to get my money's worth out of this monument to mediocrity.   Sprinkled throughout the crap are a few fun moments and a couple of decent setpiece battles but you'd be wise to get this on a BIG sale if you just have to try it.Pros:-At it's best provides some comedic B-movie trash thrills.-Decent weapon selection.-A couple of fun setpiece battles.-The boss fights are amusing when they're not half broken by bad mechanics.Cons:-At it's worst a filled diaper of anti-fun.-Subpar graphics, terrible animation, framerate hiccups, wretched cutscenes and weak sound.-Poor controls.-Horrible hit detection.-Broken mechanics.-Driving sequences are beyond human comprehension.-No multiplayer (maybe a blessing?).-A few hours of gameplay, once and done replay value and pricetag still too high.Overall:  4/10Chasing Dead is only a must buy for the most hardcore horror gamers.  I'm glad I gave this and Back in 1995  chances for science's sake but if I didn't get to them so late I'd refund them both.  There's SMALL doses of fun here but that's it."

If I get picky on certain things, then it’s not fun.For this price, definitely a thumbs up.Pros:Graphics and sound are pretty decent.Gameplay is good with many weapons to choose from.Storyline a bit sketchy at time but I liked the idea.Cons:Cut-scenes are very basic and not very interesting since it’s mostly just one person talking to you.Animation needs a lot of work both in terms of variety and quality."

,Not Recommended,428440,30166896,Posted: 25 February,all,Two Clicks,"BITESIZE:SIMILAR GAMEPLAY TO:Rogue Warrior, Zombie ParkingWHAT TO EXPECT:Basic zombie FPS.  Very short. Entry level graphics.  Limited, cheesyFMV.  Singleplayer only.  Should still be in Early Access.ACHIEVEMENTS:EASY.  Kill 5000 mutants requires repeated playthroughs - 10hrs+.STATUS:ABANDONED.  Another ca$h grab.  Unless you count TBC an adequate ending.WHEN TO BUY:NEVER.  Unless the devs bother to finish it!More info below....THE LOWDOWN:Chasing Dead is a linear FPS with mission-based gameplay set in the near future on an Earth like planet. Cue cliched plot where a virus has changed the population into mutants, leaving the squad of operatives sent in ahead, to become overwhelmed and trapped at various locations.  Cue you, to go in and rescue them.The game consists of travelling across 20 or so very short levels. Confront numerous mutants from: wolves, tigers, dogs, drones, soldiers, invisibles, failed experiments, tanks, titans and ogres.  Choose from numerous weapon types from a handgun to an RPG, go hand-to-hand or pick up a melee weapon.  If thats your preference.  Collect ammo that is sparingly distributed across levels and health that is sometimes dropped from killed mutants.  Sometimes drive a humvee or tank for the sake of it and face a couple of bosses.  FMV is used to provide a running narrative at the beginning of a level and update objectives during missions.If you ever played the final objective mode level of Dead Effect then you should get an idea of what this whole game is about.  It also has a similar ambience and feel to that game, even if its no where near it in terms of quality.THE GOOD:+ Easy to obtain achievements.  Though the last two require some grinding effort.+ You can fast-forward the FMV sections. :)THE BAD:- Its not finished.  Unless you count the TBD screen at the beginning of the last level!!- Entry level graphics.- Short badly designed levels.  I mean really, really short!- Badly written dialogue/narration. Cheesy one-liners.- Crashes on exit every time.  And I mean every time! (Win10)- Non-persistent game world.  On death the level is cleared of any enemies killed and the weapons they may have dropped prior.  So if you started the level with pistol.  If you die you lose your RPG and M16.- Enemies sometimes spawn on top of you.- It has Easy, Normal and Hard modes where the only difference is the damage you take.AND THE ORDINARY:* Decent controls.* Fitting voiceovers.  Well acted if the dialogue is sometimes a little cliche.* Drive a tank and humvee.  For 30 seconds at a time.  Then the level ends!* Varied mutant models.  Theres even a tiger!* Nice array of weapons but limited ammo carrying capacity.  From handgun, shotgun, rifles, sniper rifle, grenade launcher, flamethrower and an RPG.* Functional AI thats as cheap as the game.VERDICT:Chasing Dead is not good!  Its reminds me of the sort of game that you would have been playing 20 years ago.  Its current status demonstrates that this undertaking was clearly beyond the developers limited application of effort and resources.  Its incomplete and needs alot more content.There is some potential here but, its weak.  It could have been a barely decent low budget FPS if completed but its let down in every area.  Use of the game engine is too limited.  Level design is too basic.  Physics and weapon coding is minimal.  Animation needs to be smoother.  Spawning needs tweaking. While driving vehicles feels and looks like skating on ice rather than driving on off-road terrain.   Weapons sounds are poor.  The soundtrack clashes with the audio and the voice-over, so nothing can be heard well.  The list goes on and on.Now its very likely another abandoned Early Access title.  A failed attempt. A cash grab.  One that started with determination but ended with this pile of $crap.  If the developer ever comes back and completes the game Ill update this review because it does have a smidgen of potential.However I cant recommend this to anyone.  Beyond its incompleteness, its not worth bothering with, unless you love games that are so bad, they are good - enough to laugh at or endure.  It will need alot of work for this to change.  I doubt it will happen.  We shall see.  If youre that type of gamer then look at a heavy sale.  Achievement hunters who dont mind incomplete games may be interested for an 'easy' completion, with some significant endgame grind of an add. 20+hrs.  Otherwise stay away.  I made a mistake getting this.  Why should you, when there are better FPS games out there.  Buyer beware!!"

Unity based Zombie Shooter (Because there are none of them already :D) Cut-scenes bounce up and down and the actor's are so bad it actually makes you look away and cringe. Interesting story (No Spoilers) but the concept is lost in the horrid deployment. From the videos and screen-shots the game looks half decent however the reality is far from this. The game looks dated and feels like a very bouncy uncontrollable mess.Feels like a hobby piece.Can't really recommend this unless it's on sale.

""Wtf is going on?"" There is almost no explanation, other than on the description on this page as to who you are, why you're being sent to the second earth, why there are zombies, why are there drones, where the other freakin' characters are, and a myriad of other unexplained phenomena. And with that said, what is the signifigance of the second earth?The acting. Well, I've seen worse. It's honstly pretty freakin' bad, though. None of the characters show any true emotion regarding the situation. An couple examples are two people stuck on the second earth. They're both about to die, and don't seem to give a crap about it. In fact, one is laughing. Whaaaaat?Some weapons are interesting. The M4 is great.The zombies are.. laughable.The storyline... has no explanationThe drones. Seriously. What are they even doing on this second earth? And why are they able to kill me within a few seconds while everything else takes forever??This game looked really great. I got it for $5 and still feel ripped off. Not recommended,"

I stopped partway through writing this review and tried another level.  Nope.  I bought this on sale of $9.99 and wish I hadn't.    Glad I didn't pay the normal $24+Likes- Price- FPSDislikes- Worst voiceover's I think I've ever heard in a game.  If you are going to add voice to the game it has to be good.  Imagine if Erica had voiced GlaDOS (Portal)...- When Erica was speaking in between levels II nearly broke my Esc key trying to get her to stop.  Nope.   Being forced to listen to the  horrible dialouge that didn't seem to add any meaningful content to the game really turned me off.  Bored, tired, ""I don't want to be here"" inflection.   I would have rather just read the text, which was different than what she was stumbling through anyway.  Lena wasn't any better either.- Change the physics on the cabin curtains.  (airplane level)  I should have been able to breeze right through them like they weren't even there.  Instead, I felt like I was trying to surface in a pool with a heavy wet carpet blocking my path.- I didn't care for the game mechanics/graphics.  I've played much older games that had a better feel than this.Sadly this game really didn't do a thing for me.  I'd much rather play any of the old Quake series vs this."
