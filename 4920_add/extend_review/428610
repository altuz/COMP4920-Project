The animations and the detail to the characters and the maps are really impressive.Immersive.Strategy seems solid. Lots of cards (150 or so atm with more to come)Different factions. Orcs, Fay, Knights etcYou can change the colors and bases of your characters.Cons...It needs a more optimization atm. It runs at 60 most of the time but hits some issues fps wise sometimes.No real progression atm. This is certainly going to be a feature at some point but for now after a win etc you don't really get anything.This game looks like it is getting a store in game. That may be a bad thing depending on how the Dev runs it.(Lets cross our fingers and hope he knows better then to shoot himself in the foot with p2w etc)As a concept and what is to offer the game really has a solid base to work off of.If you believe in the project I would say support it. The game is very unique in many ways.If your looking for something with more progression atm then you may want to wait and see where it goes.I'm giving the game a thumbs up atm. For the stage it is in it has a ton of potential. What is there is done very well.I'll update this as any major changes/patches hit."

This game captures the tabletop feel and delivers on both gameplay and graphics.  with the map development tools in this game the possibilites asre truly endless.  I give it a 4.5 of 5.  Maybe when it's completed I'll give it the full 5.

Personally love the game and with the map editor there are endless possiblilties of what kind of games you can do. The Dev is also wonderful and was able to fix a major issue within an hour and is quite close with his community which is great to see. I can personally see myself playing this game for a long time. If you have any doubts please play the demo it has multiplayer and some of the single player options its defintley worth a go :)
76561198007820722,Not Recommended,428610,34994596,Posted: 16 September,all,Arkangel,"I'm only about 2 hours into the game so not a lot of playtime.  I purchased this more for the solo gaming aspect and not so much to build my own tabletop experience.  I must say, it is one of the harder hex-based games I've played in a long time.  It reminds me a little of Wartile, which I love.  However, in its current solo state, it lacks balance.  You have a handful of units that you can place in specific locations on the board.  And, in all the battles I have played thus far, the computer AI always gets to go first.  There is no initiative roll, etc.  Maybe that changes as you move deeper into the campaign.  The very first battle against the bandits was tough and took me abou8t 8 or 9 playthroughs before I was able to defeat it.  The next few encounters were much easier.  Then, I was trying to assist an outpost defend against an undead army.  There were about 3 friendly units that were overwhelmed almost immediately.  I had three units to start, a wizard, a friar and a healer.  I was pitted against about 10 or 11 enemy units.  The battle was impossible.  I spent a good hour trying various tactics to win and was barely able to scratch their units before my pitiful band was consumed.  Very disappointing as this game has great potential.  Maybe the product is geared more toward mapmaking, army building via cards, and sharing with your friends rather than the native solo battle.  I will asking for a refund for this due to its current state but will revisit it in the future to see if any improvements to the balance have been deployed."

Graphics and cards are well done and the maps so far have been great! I look forward to creating my own maps and looking at what other people create. The tactical battles take thought and strategy.

76561198006883238,Recommended,428610,33939632,Posted: 31 July,all,patram81,"I have  been playing strategy and tactical games since the sixties . Yeah! I know I should really grow up :D.I just played the first Campaign and it’s really enjoyable. Took a bit of getting used, but I managed to finish it in a reasonable length of time(don’t forget I’m old) .The potential for this game, or more accurately game system seem enormous. I see fantastic tactical squad battles will all sorts of armies real and imaginary.I may have missed it, but I did not see a save function for the skirmish game or the campaign. I think it needs one so I hope it is in the works.Anyway congratulations to the developer on a really fun game I look forward to spending a lot of time playing it."
,Recommended,428610,34400351,Posted: 21 August,all,bostonmyk,"Longsword Tabletop Tactics is a fun, well-designed game that successfully capture much of the feel of tabletop games. I would suggest it for any RPG player in general but mostly for tabletop players who for some reason can’t make their normal games.The game currently includes several modes of play including a skirmish mode where players can build force decks and play against each other and the AI, a couple of pre-constructed campaigns were players can play through a series of narrative driven scenarios and a scenario builder allowing players to build scenarios and campaigns based on their own narratives.Game play is turn based where unit, spell, magic item or fortification cards are played each turn. Unit cards represent your forces summoning them, allowing attacks, defense and numerous RPG special abilities. Magic item cards provided bonuses to units or specific attacks.  Fortifications add obstacles to the map or provide bonuses or defensive bonuses. Spells provide offensive and defensive attacks and capabilities.Mechanics (crunch) are not really transparent but are fun. There are many little mysteries to unravel in terms of capabilities and combinations and I suspect more might be going on under the hood. Mixing the decks abit can create some really interesting situations.The AI is fair. Turtler’s can be rewarded by just letting AI plow into them and then defeated in order by an action economy advantage.  This can be deterred by adding more ranged units to AI decks so hunkering down is a costly strategy. I expect as the game gets more mature and the developer gets more input a few scripted routines could be added to help with this.I haven’t played multiplayer yet so won’t say much other than there is an included chat and other feedback seems to be mostly positive. I’m 100% sure this is where you’re going to get the best game play and look forward to diving in when my time allows.The UI is immersive, beautiful and very functional. The clicks and mouse movements are very intuitive and most users will just know what to do to carry out most game functions although you should watch video or three to learn all the details. The lighting effects are attractive and along with some really great guitar music creates a very immersive atmosphere.Suggestions:1)	There are some strange behaviors with awkward camera aspect every once in awhile. I haven’t really been able to pin down the click-combo culprit but easily fixed by selecting another units point of view. This is not even close to a huge problem.2)	Deck edit or creation. Users will want to do this. I get content may support development in the future but further customization will allow players to create deeper narratives.3)	Lua script integration. Implementing this allows users to modify AI player behaviors and conditional logic. Many games use lua for this so its familiar and not uncharted territory. Allowing users to do this pretty much means you’re not going to handle every AI request or complaint that comes in as users can do it themselves."

,Recommended,428610,34809244,Posted: 7 September,all,JTHMandSQEE,"There is clearly a lot of care and good intention in Longsword - Tabletop Tactics. The base game is easy to pick up and get into, the design is well thought out and beautifully crafted and customizable (which is usually a plus in general), as are the campaigns. Lovers of tabletop games in general should not hesitate to at least TRY it. The developers seem invested with their users and appear to take into consideration any suggestion they may offer. Do take their advice and, I say again, TRY BEFORE YOU BUY. The free demo is more than enough to give you an idea of what you are in for supporting. Overall, the game shows a great amount of promise and I am eager to get my hands on the final build."
76561198085759774,Recommended,428610,33801699,Posted: 25 July,all,FlaviusBelisarius,"Why? Because nowadays a lot of us have to spend our time changing diapers instead of applying that last coat of Drakenhof Nightshade. So unless you have a devout group for game night or a local hobbyshop this is a damn fine alternative. It's impossible to recreate some of the alluring aspects of real life tabletop, but what is possible this game does capture and builds upon making it by no means targeted solely at TT players. It combines elaborate tabletop with deckbuilding/card games which should be appealing to a wide range in this day and age with games like hearthstone and duelyst. With a variety of races, abilities/units, and game modes  the strategic and replay value is immense.Also, it's gorgeous, and I can't imagine anyone not wanting to see their wyrm spit a fireball actually animated out. Be forewarned it's still in pre-alpha, which is a somewhat good thing seeing as how the content currently is significant and enjoyable, but with a seemingly boatload of content to come it's going to be exciting to see it's full release. It's easy to tell this is a work of love from the developer and wants to make a truly great game. If nothing else give the FREE DEMO a try and find out for yourself if this review is garbage or of value."

I've been looking for a game that was able to capture that type of gameplay but on a platform where making maps, battling others and overall mechanics were close to that.Longsword does it... Longsword does it well. The way you can create your armies and have actual strategy as you try to defeat your oppoenent... It brings me back to Heroscape except now it's on my PC and it's beautifully done :)The devs are super responsive, many replies to suggestions and feedback... Actually cares about the future of the game. I look forward to its greatest version and I'll be there every step of the way. As far as content goes, there is enough here for some random scrimmage matches and it's fun. Though with more cards coming out and more map editor tools on the way, it's going to get INSANE and I can't wait!!"
76561198006616220,Recommended,428610,33769393,Posted: 24 July,all,Rako,"Well, i am really exited with this GEM. Where to start? or how to define it?, simply, it is the box of dreams i ever wished to have at hand.I mean what i said, ever desired to have a tabletop to enjoy my own battles with figurines, against a decent AI, but never expected one with so amazing graphics and so easy to manage.Of course it is an early acces yet, with some bugs, but also playable now, got lot of content, medieval-fantasy by now, but much more will be added as said the Dev.The Units are reallly well done, not just passed they are beautifull, Orcs smell as orcs and looks like to be really fear (to describe just one class of army, there are many mores by now, Dwarves, elven, Humans, undeads, etc...). So plenty of diferent units classes and razes. Each sceneray, even done by someone so Clunsy as i am, with a minimun of time can look amazings. And when i say a minimun mean right that, few times before i found a so friendly editor as the one incorporated with the game, you can not only made skirmish or storyline battles, just link them into any campaign map your imagination could create.Movement of units is nice, lights and other effects like rain or fire  inmersives. I would like to speack much better english just to can express how GOOD THIS BOX OF DREAMS can be to every one who likes miniatures and tabletops role or war games. Sounds effects are in the same good line as the rest of the content, so what rest, well maybe add that Dev is reallly working on his baby, patching and adding new features and solving bugs.As it is now, the game is abolutely playable, and of course enjoyable. And the editor is something to be loved.Well worth the price, i found cheaper just comparing to any other similar (can´t find something as good, that is for sure) games or tabletops most of them without posibility to be played in single player mode as i like (rather play a multiplayer)Don´t think twice and get it, i guess you will not refund it. Or just try the Demo to have a small taste of what the fullgame has and what it will have with new adds.I forgot about the Cards, and many more amazing parts of this jewell..."

The Dev is costantly fixing it and on top of it! issues get fixed FAST!-Graphics are perfect, very well done!-Skirmish mode has three maps and all provide a enough variety for replayability-Campaign so far is tough and enjoyable, its like playing a board game through and through-Multiplayer so far is a blast, if you enjoy playing your friends and want to play a table top game but cant due to time constraints or location this game is the solution! Being able to turn this game on and connect with a friend to play against each other is an absolute blast IM HOOKED!"

However Longsword is really different.Off the get go it captured almost everything I enjoy in a challenging video game. Good graphics and attention to detail, great concept of mechanics and innovative spells.Being an EA game, I've encountered a few bugs that prohibit me from successfully completing a playthrough without some hiccup or setback. I think this is the norm on what we can expect from Early Access. However, this is where it may differ a bit. Using their website and posting issues I encounter I get a response from the dev within 24 hours.That's a service hard to come by, and that shows commitment. So here take my money, and continue on this amazing project.When this game is finished, you're going to own something that has lot's of replayability. Sort of the same addicting factors you'll find in Mobas. No 2 games will be alike."

,Recommended,428610,33824247,Posted: 26 July,all,yipiyip,"From developers who have worked on such lost gems as PoxNora, comes a spiritual successor in both art style and gameplay, as well as in fun. Longsword - Tabletop Tactics is a good game, and could be used as a good alternative to both real-world tabletop miniatures, as well as most tabletop war games in general. However, this is not a ""Tabletop War Game"" but a ""Skirmish"" game; you will often not be using more than 5-9 units at a time on the battlefield. This is not a bad thing, and I find it to be a fine way to scratch the wargame itch, but those who enjoy epic ""1000 on 1000"" battles should look elsewhere, as Longsword zooms in a bit further, and focuses on squad battles instead.ANIMATION: The units are well animated, and all visually appealing close as well as far away. Not only that, but there are a good mix of units for every faction, as well as the ability to customize the colors of units, meaning it will not go ""visually stale"" anytime soon. There are also animations for water and lava tiles, as well as sophisticated fog, lighting and particle rigs to allow for an epic table to play on. All together this makes for a beautiful game, however it currently doesn't support turning off these particle effects, meaning this game will lag on low-end computers. I sugguest looking at the required specs before purchasing, or trying the demo.GAME INTERFACES: The menus and unit information are laid out clearly, and there is a helpful (but not intrusive) ""starting guide"" to aid you in anything you're unsure of. It's easy and simple to build your army, set up a table and fight in a battle. This simplicity is even apparent in choosing/leading your troops, making it seem like the game lacks tactical depth, but that is simply not the case. Where other games choose to add ""depth"" by making a steep learning curve on the playing of the game, Longsword - Tabletop Tactics echews this approach in favor of a simple interface, creating a game that is easy to learn yet has an emerging complexity at it's core.UNITS AND FACTIONS: As with any miniature combat game, the real fun to be had in playing comes from choosing your faction and what units to deploy. With a few factions to choose from (Human, Dwarf, Orc, Fey and Undead) you will have plenty of options, as each faction starts with a scrollable page of units to deploy, buildings to place, spells to cast and items to equip. Combined with the fact that each of these are customizable in color scheme, have their own models, sound and animation, and you have a very wonderful toychest to play with here. Each faction feels unique with special abilities only they have. Undead work well with curses and debuffs, and most of their healing comes from taking life to give life, rather than normal healing. Fey are fond of flying creatures, and tricky magic, whereas humans have very straightforward spells and lots of footsoldiers and archers. The list, as it were, goes on.FINAL THOUGHTS: As it stands, Longsword - Tabletop Tactics is a superb game with hours and hours of replay value. Do I think it will replace Warhammer, Malifaux, Drop Zone Commander and Flames of War? No, nothing can ever ""replace"" the tactile enjoyment of building, painting, and playing with actual miniatures. However, Longsword does a great job of making up for that with color personalization, fully animated and voiced miniatures, and a deceptively simple game interface.I do look forward to the full release, which the developers have stated will include almost double the cards at the time of writing this review, and to any DLC they may release, which I secretly hope has a Sci-Fi version..."

I can see this game apealing to the hardcore gamer just as much as a novice.
