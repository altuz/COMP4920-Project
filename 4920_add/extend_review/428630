The type of game you would normally be able to get for free - and in fact, you can find a better version of almost this exact same game free of charge online. It's called ""Phobia"". The story, asset packs and the flow of stage transitions are almost identical except Phobia's scares are effective, it has actual puzzles and it features a runtime almost twice that of ""White Mirror.""The problems in ""White Mirror"" are numerous. No options screen (in fact, the creator encourages you to edit the setup.ini file yourself), constant grammatical errors, frequent loading screen crashes, an exploitable, buggy enemy, a key with a timed spawn, nonsensical assets like a newspaper featuring a YouTuber and a nineteenth century ""wanted"" poster, and all sorts of other inconveniences. The game is only half an hour long, yet manages to overstay its welcome by the halfway point and even end abruptly after a rehashed ""puzzle.""While I can't recommend the game in any capacity, I can recommend two other things. First, that Steam take measures to end the positive-review spam that this developer has used on ""White Mirror"" and his previous two games. Second, the people who keep Greenlighting this dev's games need to take the hint already that the final product will be disappointing.Oh, and the game's story is incomprehensible - mostly due to horrendous translation - and contains no mirrors. So there's that. Cheers!"
,Not Recommended,428630,23722922,"Posted: 23 June, 2016",all,Faudraline,"White Mirroris Infernal Dream's third indie horror game - not that I played the ones before yet - and just one of those mediocre 15 minute hits on horror with really, really, REALLY bad narrative translation. For the record, my play time is for the pure purpose of dropping game cards. It might have been a recommendation if you are a strict horror games collector who wouldn't mind the lack of a story, but for the ordinary gamer who'd enjoy a decent horror, this clearly is not it.Our game here has the implication of a story through some notes scattered around the environment, but the narrative translation is so genuinely bad, I'd be fascinated if someone would be able to understand who is who, and what's been going on. From the fragmented word usage in the notes, I've manage to gather that our hero is some kind of an occult collector/artifact hunter in search of an item called ""The White Mirror"". His search leads him to our starting area, a seemingly abandoned house. There is someone called Martin leaving us most of the notes, and I guess that's an informant of some sorts. As we go further into the house, we'll discover the mention of another person - P.G. - who should have been the former proprietor of the said mirror... and no, said mirror won't even make an appearance in this 15 minute horror shot.Graphic wise, it is mediocre. Nothing miraculous, nothing horrendous. Darkness and color shades are real heavy though as if that's a prerequisite for horror games. Shadows are heavily relied on to hide the absence of an interesting environment. The whole space is pretty much empty, without any scenic display or relevant appearance. One good thing that can be said about the atmosphere is the use of sound effects. They are successfully recorded, quite unnerving and placed around to trigger in just the right time. Once you outgrow those, you get bored straight though.Even though the game can be categorized as a horror, it is not atmospherically strong enough to unsettle you. The gameplay itself doesn't compensate for that either. For the duration of your whole game, the only threat you'll face will appear by the ending and you can easily bug it out to call it a day. There is only one ""puzzle"" that will ask you to hit some keys in the correct order used for 3-4 times. Aside that, you keep collecting some keys and items to progress. Yup, that's all. Oh, and you are given the opportunity to drink some wine and see everything in shades of red and a bit distorted from time to time. Cheers.It's not a necessarily horrible game. It just isn't interesting enough to spare time for. As long as you know what it is, you can try to give it a shot, or spare the money and watch a playthrough video. It is short and not much of an experience anyhow. The most disturbing negligence for me was the lack of decent translation for narratives. That downright kills the immersion, and there is nothing else to keep you interested anyhow.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

Game says it is a puzzler and the first puzzle is to get into the house.  Which a note tells you (in incredibly broken English) can only be opened with a key.  And then tells you where the key is.  You walk around the house, walk back to the fountain and there the key is, sitting in the basin of a fountain.  Of course, there's no real reason to actually look for it because as soon as you approach it a message on the screen says, ""PRESS 'F' TO GET KEY"".  Okay, so you grab it and continue around the house head down into the basement to turn on the generator and head around back into the house.  Walk in the house, go up to your room and cutscreen to the next night.Wait, what?  Where all the puzzles?There are in fact only about 3 puzzles in this game and those have to do with the creative combination of pressing, J K and H in an order which it isn't exactly hard to figure out.Scary?  Well, maybe if you're three years old or if you have some kind of anxiety disorder and shouldn't play horror games.Even the words ""Horror Game"" are gross overstatement.  Though there are creaky sounds, you see a flash of a monster, and actualy encounter a monster later (hint -- run around it), the only horror here is how poorly the game designer slaughters the English language.  Here's a hint, guys -- this game ain't so big that you couldn't get some kid on the internet translate what you write into passable English, maybe cost you $5.  Hell, I would have done it for free.The ""climax"" of the ""game"" is in the last area, down underground.  You walk into the area and in spooky red, splatter-like font in the center of the screen the word ""RUN"" appears.  So you run.  And you run.  And you run.  Up the stairs and then out of the house.  Game over.Wait, what?To call this a ""game"" is like calling a slingshot a ""firearm"".I kept waiting for the game and the horror to begin.  And then it was over.Only thing I can conclude is that some dude was playing around and made a test run of a game, then decided to put it up on Steam because...I dunno, maybe he needed the fifty cents?What do I expect for $1.79?  I guess more than almost nothing.  I could buy a Coke zero with $1,79 and at least I could enjoy that twice -- going in and then coming out."

You have stealth segments, puzzles (if you can call them that) to solve and in general it feels like a true game, but the more you play the more the problems show up.First of all the game is buggy to all hell. It's beyond broken at points and it crashes sometimes when loading new chapters.The single enemy in this game is absolutely brain dead. He spots you only once you are at point blank range, otherwise he doesn't see you, also he is really really slow, so you can easily outrun him.This game was made with the GameGuru engine so graphically it looks really really bad. Low res textures, poor models and all around a bad looking game.The game is also not even remotely scary. The game has a few jumpscares and only one actually got me since I was not paying attention, cause I was so bored.White Mirror is also incredibly short. The game is around 30 minutes long and there's no replay value what so ever.Overall GDnomad's games have all the same issues. The game is poorly made, it has nothing redeeming about it, so all I can say is that you should stay away from this developers games.Final Rating:1/10Pros:N/ACons:- Poor English Grammar- Boring- Short- Buggy"

,Not Recommended,428630,29717084,Posted: 5 February,all,Mellow_Online1,"White Mirror is a mostly average horror game. There are some good things to it and there are some bad things to it, but there's a certain thing about this game that's making me not recommend it and I'll explain that once I've actually told you about the game it's self.White Mirror's plot is that you're sent to this old abandoned house to look for a mirror that's located in the cellar of the house. It's a simple enough premise for a horror game and for White Mirror's purpose it pulls it off mostly okay.Gameplay consists of you wandering around the house trying to achieve the objectives listed out in your book. Different objectives require different things to be done in order to achieve them. Sometimes your objectives are straight forward and sometimes they aren't too much and require you to complete a puzzle. This would normally be good however there's 1 thing that brings this type of differentiation in gameplay down. The English translation. The game is made by a Russian developer and apparently he couldn't invest in someone to translate the game over to English and most of the English is broken and sometimes illegible. This impacts on the gameplay because throughout the game, clues on how toa chieve your objectives are written on notes with the afformentioned broken English and illegibility. This in turn impacts on the puzzles as the hints of what you actually need to do for the puzzles are illegible and you won't know what to really do unless you consult a walkthrough. There's also a stealth segment near the end of the game where you have to sneak across to your destination past a monster, however this stealth section isn't done well because the enemy AI is terrible and he'll most likely get stuck on something and won't even be able to get to you. The game is also really short, you can probably beat the game in around 1 hour, if you speedrun it, you can probably beat it in 30 minutes.The horror elements are going to be hit or miss depending on what kind of horror fan you are. If you're easily gotten by jumpscares and a dark atmosphere that isn't really used to it's full potential, then you'll probably like the horror White Mirror provides. If you're like me and you require a bit more out of horror games other than jumpscares. then you're probably not going to get a good experience out of White Mirror. I was only really scared twice in the whole game. The first was durign the afformentioned stealth segment, up until I realised the AI was f*cked, and teh second was by a jumpscare near the end of the game, mainly because unlike the rest of the jumpscares in the game it caught me off guard.Graphics and sound are probably the best thigns about the game. Graphics aren't anything great but they look pretty good, the lighting in the game is well done as well. The sound is very well done, the music can sometimes be a bit too distracting in parts of it but the sound design is overall pretty effective, it's just a shaem the rest of the horror the game offered didn't live up to it.Now, I mentioned at the start that there was somethign else that I wanted to comment on which makes me not recommend the game, and that's the developer's actions. GDNomad (the developer and publisher) has gone through discussions deleting any discussions complainign about things like game crashes, people unable to play it ect. and at the times where GDNomad does respond to these discussions, he claims that it isn't on his end, it's on the users end that these issues are occurring and even accuses people of obtaining illegal OS. My friend, gamer and reviewer Zaxtor99 covered this in detail in the last 5 minutes of his review, so i recommend you go and check it out here:https://youtu.be/QLjMBjZygLs?t=11m46sPersonally, I wouldn't have liked to endorse the behaviour showcased by this developer and I'm aware some people don't like to endorse this kind of behaviour either, which is why i included this in the review.Pros+ Okay setup+ Good graphics+ Good sound design+ Variation on gameplayCons- Bad English translation- Poor AI- Cheap horror elements- Short- Terrible behaviour from the developerFinal verdict: 4/10My Steam curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews"

This is because if you have played one of his games, then you have pretty much played them all. This game is pretty much exactly the same as 'wooden house', just change the title and change the chasing skeleton to another monster and you have exactly the same game.Each game requires you to enter an establishment, usually a house, go down to the basement where you will be treated to comical un-scary whisperings, a npc will often appear somewhere and chase you for 10 seconds, you then have to solve a puzzle using 'HJK' keys because that's all his skill in programming allows. A poorly translated supernatural story about a mirror which produces what I can only describe as a mud monster with red eyes?This is probably his best work which is really not saying much as the game still has the same bugs galore that require you to constantly save every chapter.Like the developer instead of putting in any real work in future I'll just copy and paste my review and change its title...Tips for developer: Retire!"

The first game I'd played is The Lost Souls and this is worst than the previous one. I'd finished this game in 15 minutes without saving, loading or die. And 3 hours plus game time hours is for idling cards to drop.As a horror games, this walking simulator game is not scary. Game design is laughable. Soundtrack is okay. Narative is a mess. Who is protagonist!? What is White Mirror!? In 15 minutes, even at short horror movie. A good narative is a must have for a short game like this. The good thing for this game is cheap in Infernal Dream Collection Bundle and has cards, and other than that is not.Can't recommend it ..."

Some of the sound design was alright, but it's a short experience that doesn't use its cheap qualities well, has a few bugs, and turns out more silly than effective. It re-uses the same puzzle multiple times (and is the only puzzle in the game), there's maybe two encounters with anything threatning, and most of it is just walking around bland-looking environments while spooky sounds happen and you collect things. Still, could of been worse, found myself amused, and for $2 you could do a lot worse, even in the first-person indie horror game scene. Not recommended if you want a good game, and thus why I don't recommend it (much better alternatives), but in the end not offensively bad or anything, more... Silly-bad. Grammar and spelling mistakes up the wazoo, the whole game is about a cursed mirror and you never see the mirror... I don't strongly dislike it, it's not good, and I guess if you really want to experience it, then go for it.

Not exactly ""triumphantly"" - that'd be a stretch - but I'm actually going to ""recommend"" this one, believe it or not.  Before your itchy fingers go hittin' that  ""Add to Cart"" button, however, allow me the benefit of a few small ""disclaimers""...Firstly, no, I don't know the dev personally, and if I did I would have happily offered to translate all text in his game into English...something which Google has clearly failed to do on his behalf.  I actually suspect that one day I may in fact cave and offer my translating ""skills"" (i.e. I do actually speak English) to one of these Euro developers, but I think I'll save that for the day I find a genuinely talented one.  Yuriy Mamedov is not that developer - certainly not yet - and this is certainly not that game.  But one day, perhaps...Secondly, Steam DOES NOT HAVE A NEUTRAL BUTTON.  I seem to have confused punters more than once in the past by thumbing-up something which I seem quite critical and/or ""meh"" about, and this is simply because I figure a 5 or more out of ten has GOT to qualify as some kind of ""pass""; and as this game is neither outrageously incompetent nor entirely unentertaining, I figure I'd give it a C-minus if I was a teacher.  Hence, a 5 out of 10.  Hence, a thumb-up rather than a thumb-down.  If you should have a problem with this ratings system I have employed, KINDLY GO EAT A♥♥♥♥♥♥  It's a reviewer's opinion, not a command from God.  Would you like me to WIPE YOUR♥♥♥♥♥♥for you, also?  Then again, if you've read this far into the review, I'm presuming you didn't just thumb my ""positive"" review down on sight, out of principle, and type some nonsense below about how I'm ""obviously friends with the developer"".  Steam users really do need to learn to READ reviews before jerking their knees as the first response.  Just because a reviewer gives a game a reluctant thumb-up DOES NOT mean that they believe said game to be the best ♥♥♥♥in' thing since sliced bread.  5/10 means just that...a pass.  BARELY.Thirdly, Mr Mamedov, unlike a number of his peers, actually does show some vague and distant POTENTIAL.  I'm not saying he's come anywhere NEAR to that potential here...no sirree.  But at least he finally made a game which lasts for longer than twenty minutes - well, okay, about twenty-five, but that's still progress - and he has finally proven that he knows how to create a tiny bit of ATMOSPHERE.  His use of SOUND is especially commendable...he truly does know how to set up a smidgen of eeriness, and upon rare occasion even pays off said attempts at ""suspense"" with something resembling the aural equivalent of a bona fide ""jump-scare"".  He then, of course, proceeds to ♥♥♥♥ it all squarely in the♥♥♥♥♥♥by having some staggeringly lame ""chase scene"" where you stroll very briskly up a corridor while a monster who LOOKS like it's running full-pelt somehow never seems to catch up with you...but this is what the word ""potential"" is all about.  Mr Mamedov at least gets part-way there, and on this occasion, he's arguably gotten further than he ever has before.  If he would just stop asking money on Steam for short-as♥♥♥♥♥♥DEMOS, and devote five years of his life to making a substantially LONGER game combining all his strengths - while hopefully leaving out his myriad weaknesses - then we may actually have a contender for an honest-to-God, true-to-life VIDEO GAME DESIGNER.Seriously, at this rate, I reckon I'll be handing out a 5.5 to Yuriy's next game, and a 6 to the one after that...so we're only about five or six more ""games"" away from something a human being might actually want to PAY for.  Keep up the good work, Yuriy.  I, for one, believe in you.  The bits in the underwater caverns in this game are actually REALLY GOOD.  Atmospheric.  Spooky, even.  BRIEF, yeah, but...gettin' there.  VERY, VERY SLOWLY...but definitely gettin' there.So the choice is yours, humble reader.  You can pay five bucks - less, on sale - for a twenty-five minute demo which would make a Mum proud, or you can spend your money on something else.  Personally, I've paid good money for much, much worse here on Steam in the past twelve months or so.  Hell, I even got a good chuckle out of the insanely bad A.I. which had the game's one-and-only ""enemy"" perpetually running at a whopping great iron fence in some misguided attempt to get at me...so I'm happy.  Oh, and we even get a sweet little carrot on a stick at the end, with those immortal words ""To be continued"" coming up on the screen.  I don't doubt it for a second, Yuriy, my friend.  I don't doubt it for a second.Verdict: 5/10.(PS Cheers for the free copy, Yuriy.  One thing, though...I haven't received that five hundred bucks in my account yet.  Any chance of speeding that up?

Just wonder around very short levels picking up keys and flicking switches sums the game up. There are simplistic puzzles, sort of. I say sort of because sometimes even getting the puzzle wrong unlocks the the door anyway. Oh and the predicatable 'jump scare' attempts that are more luaghable than scary.Graphically its no looker, although the ambient sounds are actually pretty decent. Really there is so much better available and this has bundle filler written all over it. It's how I ended up owning it."

It wasn't the worst attempt at a game that I've ever played, but I wouldn't say this was good either. This looks and plays like something for free off Game Jolt. There's no reason anyone should have to pay money for this. There was just enough of a jumbled mess of a story to get you from one random location to the next, doing mindless tasks that mean nothing. On the bright side, it's a step up from My Bones.**Spoiler alert** There is no damn mirror anywhere."

But there wasn't much of a story, needed a definate spell. Also the monster wasn't scary at all and the ringing chime sound should be removed and only used for when the monster is near. I was hopeful for a good game but recieved a mediocre game."

The graphics weren’t that bad though, the writing wasn’t the easiest to read as it made no sense but you get the jist of what it meant. there were a couple of parts of this game that scared me *jumpscare like* overall didn’t really understand it. It crashed for me twice when i tried to go into the basement.. 3rd time lucky it loaded properly. Couple of times the game flickered too and i don't think that was deliberate..... But i would recommend if you want a silly game to play just for a laugh and if you’re willing to spend £1.59 then why not."

A settings menu would be nice due to the fact that the particles cause me to lose frames drastically. Other than that, so far it is a pretty decent horror game. It has a nice eerie atmospere and looks nice aswell. Just keep with the game and it'll turn out fine."
