The destructable walls, good selection of items/weapons, good controls, gamepad support and local-coop (2-4) all contribute to a really great package of a game IMHO.Solid mechanics, easy to get into and enjoy, bought this for half price this week but would have been fine if I paid 100% for it.  I bought this at the same time as GTA 5 on the Steam sale and for whatever reason, maybe as its just easier to dive into, I've been playing Neon Chrome way more than GTA 5 if you can believe it.Recommended if you like twin stick shooters.  Also note that the graphics didn't really do much for me in the screenshots but actually playing the game the game looks better. There seems to be a bit of a blurry AA or something filter but the graphics definitely are good enough to get the game going."

Let me darn my fanboy garments right now!That game! THAT game!Yeah, it's your typical procedurally generated dual stick shooter surfing the Isaac wake. Yeah it's got that retro 80s look that's all the craze, up to the (spunky) synthwave soundtrack.What is not captured by the screen grabs is how great the weapons feel. How cool they sound. How their pitch goes up when running out of ammo, so you don't have to look down at a counter to evaluate your situation. How the same is true for your adversaries. How the action will escalate to mind-blowing levels of mayhem as you progress in the later levels. How you can build up your own class through skills and weapons you pick up. How stealth is an option. How the constantly rewarding progression makes you feel like you didn't waste time, even doing a terrible run. How the game saves your progress transparently.But especially, how so damn cool it is to walk back through the path of destruction you carved up, pretty much anything being destructible. That alone is a reward of its own.I am ecstatic. This is one of those few games that get pretty much everything right. When the basis are this stable, such level of attention to details is just heartwarming."

For me, it is the most important quality. Whatever you do, even if you manage to survive only a few levels, you will have the chance to upgrade your skills.The upgrades to your character on every run also add spice to the story.The gameplay is not reflex-based, more tactical, it is about knowing your enemies and types of weapons and secondary weapons. The bosses are also become less and less difficulty as your character improves, but they still stay challenging.It is also good either for short bursts or for longer sessions.The levels are procedurally generated, and that keeps the replayability basically endless. They are not too small (like in Forced: Showdown), not too large either, so there is enough place for tactical movement.In overall: it is a great game for casual gamers, who would like to see their efforts not in vain (I look at you: roguelikes with lose-everything permadeath), also has a nice soundtrack and atmosphere."
,Recommended,428750,22702306,"Posted: 29 April, 2016",all,Ryan Dorkoski,"Neon Chromeis an excellent addition to this fairly new wave/subgenre of frantic rogue-lite-esk top down shooters that truly reward knowledge and learning the system.While I still feelStarward Roguecould be a contender for indie game of the year 2016,Neon Chromeplays very similar but is more polished (the two are very different in other important ways though - ie. this is not a bullet hellper se). Essentially, in Neon Chrome, you have a primary and secondary weapon, plus a melee attack. The secondary weapon takes ammo, and all the primary weapon needs is reloading management. The melee attack takes much more skill and planning, but is totally worth getting to know. You play a series of clones (very similiar toStarward Rogue), in an attempt to climb a corporate tower. The voice acting is very good, and the story seems decent.Like any game of this genre, its all about the meta-game.The clone you are currently driving will collect money for meta-game upgrades such as health, damage, slots, etc. This will help ensure success for future clones.Pros:+Controls and gameplay are butter smooth. It is much slower thanStarward Rogue, which isn't necessariliy good or bad; just different.+Graphics are quite polished, if not a bit dark (I've requested a brightness slider for couch players).+Up to 4-player local co-op!!! This is awesome!+Very addicting. Each run is very fun and definately calls me back. So far the frustration level has been very minimal.+Dozens of quality play hours for anyone that wants to even remotely finish the game, and achievements.+Nearly (if not all) of the level is destructable, which really adds another layer to the strategy.+Excellent game saving function!Cons:-Music is real meh, and feels fairly generic.Neon Chromeis excellent.If you normally love games in this genre, this is a no brainer."

,Recommended,428750,32089376,Posted: 31 May,all,Whateverman,"I've played this game for ~32 hours, and am currently working on the third playthrough (aka. 3.0).Initially, I bought it because I liked the game's premise, and the graphics made it look interesting.  What kept me coming back, actually,  was achievment chasing.  The game is fairly easy to play, but the some of the achievments were surprisingly difficult.Consider that I tend to like easy-ish games because they're casual, but I obsess on challenging achievments.  Doesn't seem all that consistent, does it?  And yet this game has a good blend of both - and that's what hooked me.These days, Neon Chrome should be fairly inexpensive, but I think it's still a better than average value.  The replayability is impressive (to me); you can choose a different style of play each time you boot it up, and yet accumulate statistics in the form of purchased upgrades, no matter which character you play.  After beating the game, you have the option of increasing the difficulty yo the next levelk, which increases dropped rewards, etc.Overall, Neon Chrome delivers casual fun in a way that kept me playing for longer than I'd planned on playing.  That's gotta count as a successful game."

Our first several attempts were cut short as we constantly grenaded each other.  As we became familiar with what the heck was going on and actually communicated, we progressed steadily.  We each fell into niche classes and roles.  Him with the Assassin and stealth, while I charged around wrecking any and everything as the Cyber Psycho.  After the second and third Overseer our process had become...methodical.  We learned the way the AI operated in enough circumstances that we could trap them minimize our damage taken, and...cruel as it sounds....it was fun.  Running those poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s into un-winnable situations where we waited, weapons at the ready.  We fell out of Neon Chrome after maxing our upgrades and unlocking everything (except for the last Cyberware...which I STILL don't have....dammit)  and we moved on to other projects.  However, Overseer 4.0 sat there in his chair....mocking me.  I had made it to floor 23 on a solo run...I could get him...I could kill him.  I obsessed over getting enough credits to fund a maxxed out run from the bottom to the top.  If I was going to overthrow that maniacal a**....I was going to do it right.   And I did.  But then there was overseer 5, and 6....Now I am 56 hours deep and I have met with my greatest foe.Overseer 8.  He has consistently shut me down with waves upon waves of troops, and a Caretaker that seems nigh indestructable.  This game truly is just a series of processes to me now.  I have reached the point in this game where others stop seeming fun, and yet I play on.  I know the numbers just get higher, nothing really changes anymore...but I need to know.....just how many Overseers are there?  When does it end?!  When have I won?!!?!Resounding Recommendation"

,Recommended,428750,30963659,Posted: 5 April,all,fancy portion,"Neon Chrome is honestly very good.  It succeeds as a twin-stick shooter and as a roguelite.  As a twin-stick shooter it steals many of the best mechanics and basic gameplay feel from 10tons' own much earlier classic Crimsonland, but adds destructible environments, special attacks, and rudimentary stealth.  Also your character is actually much sturdier than in Crimsonland, which is funny for a roguelite but it fits the format better since you don't heal up between levels.As a roguelite, it has a gradual perk unlocking system that makes the binding of isaac look incredibly detailed by comparison, but actually, the high-level unlocks are obviously intended to allow scope for a little bit of a ""build"" aside from simple max dps.  Simple stuff like ""shots have 15% chance to stun enemies"" + ""stunned enemies take double damage"".  Between runs you spend the money you earned on permanent boosts to damage, or perk slots, yada yada rogue legacy upgrade your castle we've all seen it.  It's all done very well here.If you enjoy roguelites, it's not as fun as the binding of isaac but currently, in my opinion, no roguelite is really trying to compete with that.  Short of TBoI, this one is about as fun as they get.  If you enjoy twin-sticks, well, this is crimsonland in roguelite form."
76561198003716895,Recommended,428750,28315140,"Posted: 11 December, 2016",all,Partycrasher,"This is a very polished blend of roguelike arpg and top-down shooter. Unlike some roguelikes, this has persistant unlocks and stat upgrades, which allows for a feeling of progress even when restarting. The different classes offer a nice variety of playstyles and the wide range of cybernetic upgrades effectively allow you to customise your character (or 'asset') throughout a game.It's also a lot more immersive than the screenshots suggest. I think that this is largely due to the excellent sound design. There is an impressive attention to detail here, eg different weapon types have a satisfyingly distinctive sound and the pitch of a weapon will change when the clip is running low, the synth soundtrack changes to elevator music as you get close to an elevator etc. There are also some great graphical touches, such as being able to see the falling rain in the Bladerunner-like city outside.It has a similar atmosphere and look to the excellent Brigador, but my impression is that Neon Chrome is somewhat more polished and definitely more accessible to casual players (but of course it's also a different type of game). Unlike Brigador, Neon Chrome automatically saves your progress if you have to leave mid-game (hint: use the 'Exit' option, not  'Disconnect'), which is an essential feature for casual players."

A top down, twin stick shooter with numerous ways to outfit and upgrade your protagonist for a variety of simple but satisfying virtual violence.I have to say that I'm a little bit dissapointed that there hasn't been a tremendous amount of innovation or evolution in the years between the two games.Crimsonlandwas fairly deep for a twin stick shooter. I was hoping for more clever game mechanics added into the formula here.The story is about as thin as you can get and still call it a story. Maybe I'm being generous there. However, the hammy evil megalomaniac antagonist is pretty entertaining and cartoonishly sinister.It is good, and I will probably be playing it on and off for a while, but I'd really hope for more from 10tons in the future.If you're looking for a bit of casual shooter ultraviolence that you don't have to think too much about to play, this is your ticket"

It's an enjoyably difficult top-down shooter with some rogue-like elements and enough variety to keep coming back.The graphics are solid, no difficulty in spotting enemies, (though to be fair, if it's moving and it isn't you, it's an enemy).  Plenty of neon-drenched plastic and chrome to fit the setting, and it all runs quite smoothly on an older laptop.Gameplay, again, is very solid.  I haven't tried a gamepad yet, but the keyboard/mouse controls are smooth and responsive, although I did end up rebinding the reload key for easier access.  While there's permadeth, you can earn persistent upgrades (health, damage, etc) and each run gives you a choice between multiple ""classes"", each with different perks.  There's a decent variety of weapons with more than enough differences to make them have some impact on play.In terms of replayability, this works well as a coffee break game or for an hour or so of blowing stuff up.  The persistent upgrades help push the ""just one more run"" feel, but it's shallow enough that you can jump right back in even if you haven't played for awhile.Definitely a recommended game for good, old-fashioned mindless arcade type fun."

If you've ever played Crusader, you will love Neon Chrome. It starts out like an ordinary arcade, but as you beat it once and begin all over again on a higher difficulty level, it WILL kick your backside - enemies are quick to react, have pretty good search patterns and, even though any single enemy isn't that much of a challenge, 20 of them in a narrow corridor, with only an elevator behind you, will have you sweating bullets.You can go in guns blazing, you can try to use game's simple stealth system, you can die over and over again to upgrade your character(s), or you can pick a cheesy special ability that, for example, lets you fart out 6 grenades at once, and blow up all the loot.Screenshots don't do the game justice - it looks much better in action, and low-poly models are a decent tradeoff for constant 60 FPS and instant map loading, even with half a batallion of NPCs moving around the level."

,Recommended,428750,23914030,"Posted: 28 June, 2016",all,Auburok,"In Neon Chrome you are a hacker that uses cyborg ""assets"" to wage an internal war inside of an archology. The game is a top-down roguelike, and thusly things are randomized quite a bit. The player progresses through floors full of enemies, upgrades and containers to loot looking for cash and weapons on their warpath to the top of the tower.Each time a ""run"" is started, you pick a character out of three, each with a different role, weapon and ability. Weapons and abilities can be swapped out during your run if you find something more suitable, but roles will determine quite a bit of your playstyle. For instance: hackers can open purple boxes and use purple terminals that will allow them to possible collect more loot, while assassins are able to hide in the shadows and go unseen. A lot of weapons fall under the SMG/assault rifle/burst rifle/shotgun heirarchy, but there are also grenade launchers, rail guns, rocket launchers, heavy pistols and some other fun toys. As you loot more weapons, the weapon ""level"" increases. You will always find better guns up until the point you reach the top, or, less desirably: die.In death, however, not all is lost. Your asset is left behind, a stain on one of the floors of game's namesake. The cash you earned is the real prize. This cash can go into upgrading your assets' health, damage, luck, energy and how many cybernetic upgrades they can have, along with puchasing previously found weapons and upgrades to have them from the start of a fresh run. These upgrades are never lost, and you eventually become a powerhouse.The floors are randomly generated, and while sometimes you will recognize some ""tiles"", the placement is often pretty well done and I didn't get a ""samey"" feeling that tends to creep up on roguelikes that make use of tiles for map generation. One of the more interesting mechanics is that many walls, ""thin"" walls, are able to be shot through with any weapon. Some weapons will take a few shots, but there's nothing quite like firing a rail gun through a wall, nailing three or four guys in the process. In addition to this, there are some special levels that are accessed by taking an alternative exit. These levels are hand crafted mini challenges that are a fun way to break up the randomized mayhem, some of them even being puzzles of sorts. The goal of the top floor takes about an hour, depending on how thorough you are and how many special levels you take on.Once you reach the end of Neon Chrome, all is not as it appears. The cycle continues, only this time enemies are harder, the layouts are more cluttered with mines, and the loot is more enticing. Your character, which seemed powerful, is now no longer shredding enemies, and the quest to upgrade even more starts anew.The music and sound design are very good and fit the cyberpunk theme/artstyle very well. There is some voice acting, and it's not bad. Overall, it's a tight, well-made experience.There is local coop, but I didn't have a chance to try it. There is no plan to include net multiplayer, so if that's a dealbreaker I would skip out on it (though NVidia's gameshare may be a way around that).TL;DR: I highly recommend this game."

PERSISTENCE IS NOT ROGUELIKE.  Persistence is the very opposite of roguelike!And on top of that, persistent unlocks that simply increase your damage and health by flat amounts or percentages across all playthroughs are a lousy form of persistence, and this game is chock full of them.   If you desperately needed to include unlocks in order to satisfy those weird people out there who play games for unlocks rather than the actual gameplay, the weapon unlock system is fine and could have been kept pretty much as-is.This is not a roguelike/lite and the developers do not understand what that even means.

A new environment of rooms and corridors, similar functions yet better AI, looting and quests to it's predecessor.Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine - The ambience, movement, the use of weapons, hacking, this plays like a shooter version of Monaco. Stealth is used more here to determine where and how to engage the enemy.Hotline Miami - This is the base comparison for 2d shooters in close quarters. Neon Chrome is less frantic and has a larger view of the kill field. It's not as visceral but to me that makes it less jarring. The screen is busier and there's more to do with a destructive environment around you.Rogue Legacy - Game difficulty curve, upgrades at castle and death cycle are similar to Rogue Legacy.8.5/10."

In my youth I played Crimsonland a lot however it was a rather basic isometric shooter. My interests in games changed from being solely a ""shoot everything that moves"" style to things with more depth. While I still enjoy that kind of game I prefer games with replayability, choices and of course satisfactory action. Neon Chrome was a huge suprise to me when I got it and I have enjoyed it greatly. The randomised levels add a detail of uncertainty, the gunplay is very satisfactory, the colors, theme and soundtrack blend together like a cyber-punk grape smoothy. There are a ton of upgrades to find and a fully destroyable environment that really gives this game a unique appeal. It is really a game that is easy to get into and difficult to master. 15 dollars was well spent with this minor gem."

The gameplay mechanics, weapon variety, and perks make this game very fun to play.  I highly recommend this game to those that enjoy this type of genre and newcomers as well.The game can be played with KB+M or controller.  As for gameplay there are 28 stages, each stage consists of going from point A to point B, sometimes there will objects that you have to do in order to advance to the next stage.  Throughout the levels you will find money, weapons, perks, and weapon upgrade stations.The environment is semi-destructible, you can shoot or smash walls down to create new entry ways.  I should note that this is limited, but the feature is there and works very well.After you die and you have the option to purchase upgrades that will remain permanent throughout your entire gameplay.  Also the game has save points, if you exit mid-stage, upon starting the game again you start at the beginning of the stage.  If you beat a boss, this will unlock a new starting point so if you die at any stage after the boss, you won't have to start from the very beginning again, you continue right after the boss.I don't have any major gripes.  I will say that not having the ability to dodge is kind of a bummer, but does not ruin the overall experience.As for hours to price ratio, you will definitely get your money's worth and much more.  I've played a variety of roguelites/likes and none of them really gives me that strong ""just one more run..."" feeling like this game does.

It's a little confusing at first, but put some stats in ""luck"" so you'll get more loot, which will help you level up your other skills faster.

I came to play a game, not read a book.  This game has exactly the right amount of forced story, imo.  And for me, it doesn't hurt that it's a sci-fi with Shadowrun-style elements.- Although similar, it's softened the edges of the grind/hardcore components that Rogue Legacy has, which means I might actually play to completion!Cons:- seriously why so blurry?  reminds me of old days CRT monitors going bad, which likely means it's causing eye strain and honestly makes me believe it could be harmful**the blurriness can be lessened significantly (but by no means eliminated) by disabling dynamic resolution - at least on some monitors?EDIT: the blurriness can indeed be removed as the dev kindly replied.  i had tried disabling options 1-by-1.  i should've tried all off and selected one at a time.  it's the combination of disabling ""dynamic resolution"" and the ""post processing filter"" that makes the game as crisp as can be.- i could be wrong but i fought the 2nd boss 4 times so far and have come to the conclusion that the fight is vastly more difficult than 3rd and 4th bosses + just about requires that you have unlocked one of a small number of abilities that are viable for the final evolutionEDIT: i played back through a few times on 1.0 and 2.0 overseer levels (if you haven't yet played the game, overseer levels basically = going back through from level 1 on increasingly higher difficulty) and i no longer notice such a large discrepancy with 2nd boss.  however i will still say that regardless of loadout (which makes a huge difference), starting with greatest difficulty i rank the bosses at 5-2-3-4-1.  not a huge deal, just expected a progression since it is a linear path (unlike, say, megaman games where there was also a discrepancy in boss difficulty but you could go to any world in any order).  still, i don't know what anyone else's opinion is on this matter and this part boils down to an opinion.- ***MINOR SPOILER ABOUT AN ENHANCEMENT***************************************""Nanoedge Chameleon Skin"" has a description of ""You are undetectable while stationary"".  While I have indeed had enemies walk somewhat near me and go right by without noticing, I have also seen enemies that were chasing me (i had turned a corner and stood still / went into stealth before they came around the corner) walk right up to me and attack.  Additionally I have witnessed enemies who couldn't have possibly seen me go into stealth come around a corner and start shooting from afar (not even walking up to me first).

Allow me to explain why.Graphics::::::Set in a futuristic Neon Cyberpunk and Blade-Runner-esq world, Neon Chrome is a pleasure to play. This game offers beautiful colors, particles, glow (not overdone) and polish.Soundtrack::::::Cyberpunk and almost 80's-esq, my hats off to the composer/producer - you nailed it. I found myself zoning out to the beats and tunnel-visioned while my ears were serenaded.Gameplay:::::In this game you can upgrade your stats such as Damage, Health, Luck, Energy(for special abilities), and more. Currency is the name of the game in this Neural-Tech slautghter fest. Need money? Get yourself a hacker and start back from Level 1 all the way up the ladder, unlocking hack-boxes for better loot and increased money. Take alternate paths for hundreds of secrets levels, challanges and puzzles to solve (if you choose and if you dare).Prefer stealthy gameplay? Use the nanofiber loadout and be undetectable while sniping with a penetrating railrun from the corners and shadows. The AI or Overseer will detect your preference for stealth gameplay and not flood the level with mobs but place them rather strategically, perhaps even throw down some mines to challange you.Level Design::::::The levels are well thought out, balanced, and offer unique challanges each time you play through with random rooms, loot, and the occasional obsticals. ""Hmm, do I shoot that explosive canister and blow up all the enemies in the room? Or be more cautious, pick them off, and take in the loot."" It's up to you with the beautiful level designs; part pre-made and parts random. The levels increase in difficulty and design as you climb the ladder through each chapter (adding more obsticals, more enemies, or less enemies but stronger ones). All in all, the AI for generating these levels is top-notch.Conclusion:::::Overall I can't recommend this game enough. Besides the listed genre(s) of 'Indie' 'Cyberpunk' 'Twin Stick Shooter' and 'Action', this game also has fairly substantial RPG elements as well. The RPG is not hardcore and thus I understand not listing it as an RPG; afterall, it is a top-down slaughter fest. However with the way the upgrades, unlocks, and replayability go - I would also list this game as RPG-lite. 10/10.Purchase this game, support these devs and spread the word about NEON CHROME!You will enjoy this, soldier."

When I first tried it, I was looking for someting to kill about 15 minutes or so late one night before bed, and thought to myself I'll just check it out and see if I like it. It was over three hours later that I next looked up from the monitor and realized that while I had been playing, the sun had gone down and as I hadn't turned on any lights before I had sat down at the computer, the whole house had now become pitch black dark and I hadn't even noticed it happening - ALL my attention had been on the game.  Being a somewhat distractable person, that's actually pretty significant. :)I would describe in detail why the game is so amazingly fun and compelling, but that would take time and I've got to get back to playing it right now.  I've already called in to work and told them I've been quarrantined with virulent bubonic plague to make sure there's plenty of time in my immediate future to continue to advance through the game's brilliant and changing levels.  I also made sure to take the precaution of boarding up shut all my windows and doors (after stockpiling food supplies, of course), and burying my phone in the dirt floor of my basement to prevent any pesky and inconvenient interruptions, visitors, or general calls to socialize in the world outside of Neon Chrome.

The cyberpunk theme, killer soundtrack and RPG-ish aspects really make it shine. The game uses a semi-Roguelike constant-progression system that penalizes you for death whilst still making your failed efforts worthwhile, even if only incrementally. The game can be a little tough at first but once you've bought some upgrades and got some progression under your belt, it becomes much more manageable. The game even manages to work some narrative into the campaign, which I did not expect.I am not usually a fan of twin stick shooters, so I was skeptical at first, but the incredible soundtrack, RPG elements and cyberpunk style won me over.

One of my favorite games on steam that is quite underrated is ""ShadowGrounds"".  In reading the reviews I am surprised nobody mentioned this.  ""Neon Chrome"" feels like a much more polished ""ShadowGrounds"" only with INFINITE levels!  I am so stoked to rack up some hours in this game.  I am a big fan of the 80's aesthetic and this game absolutely NAILS it.  The visuals have this cyberpunk vibe to them and the world outside the walls looks like it was ripped straight out of ""BladeRunner"", in a GOOD way!  The soundtrack is also wonderfully 80's and fits perfectly.  I really enjoy roguelikes, but one thing that irks me is the lack of feeling like you progressed.  ""Neon Chrome"" negates this by letting you collect loot to spend as permenant upgrades to your runs.  Along with this in your runs you can unlock new weapons to find permanently and a ""Nuclear Throne"" style temporary run upgrade system as well.  The levels are unique and randomly generated.  Every five levels there is a shortcut added too after you beat the challenging boss, if you are into that.  This game OOOZES polish, I bought this purely on a whim and I will be telling everyone I know about it.

The great game element that I've not seen in this style of game before is that whenever you die, you get money to buy upgrades, so you do not get stuck without enough power-ups to beat the next boss.  Similar to RPG's, you can just grind and power-up, then try again!You discover new weapons and upgrades as you delve higher into the tower, and similar to some of my favorite rogue-likes, you then have the option to buy your initial load-out for your next attempt through the levels.  There are also checkpoints so you can skip the easy levels once they no longer provide you with enough benefit for the time you would spend there.This is very well thought out and solid game for the price, and if you are interested based on the above, then I strongly recommend this game!"

The gunplay feels great, and the progression system is rewarding so far.The different ""classes"" are different enough to feel unique, but still balanced enough to where I can't pick a favorite, and none stand out as the ""best"" at everything.I'm a big fan of the setting and little bit of story that I have encountered so far. The cyber-punk asthetic is pretty cool, and the fact that the game uses polygons and not pixel art is refreshing (I can't believe I have to say that).The music is FANTASTIC. It fits the theme perfectly.After five hours straight of playing the game, my only real complaint is that there is no rumble support if using a controller.I saw that the game was made by the makers of Crimsonland, a game that I was obsessed with over a decade ago.

Neon Chrome is the far better game though with more immersive gameplay and actual strategy surrounding the destructible environments and how you will use them to your advantage.  On the first Boss fight I found myself hiding behind walls and structures to escape death only to have my cover eventually crumble down around me. That feeling alone makes you feel like your playing a much more intelligent game than just your average robotron romp.  The rogue aspects come into play in two different forms.  1st the spending of previously collected cash to upgrade your clone operatives permamently in areas regarding health, power, luck, etc. and 2nd using cash to equip your next battle ready clone with temporary upgraded weapons and tech if you so desire.

To my elated surprise, it's actually pretty fun and addicting.The cyber punk atmosphere actually succeeds at bring somewhat cyberpunky (a word? now it is). Not very many games a have succeeded in that, so hats off to them for that. It even keeps to the generally grey morality of many cyber punk games by having you play as a person who seems tohack into peoples brains in cryo sleep and use them as weapons until their utter demise.The gameplay itself is solid. There are a few classes that can be chosen from at the beginning of a run and, with money from previous runs, you can get premanent upgrades or purchase equipment for your next run. The combat is fun and there is a decent variety among the enemies.The best part about the gameplay is the permanent pregression. (I personally think that) A rouge-like needs to have some form of permanent progression between runs, and Neon Chrome gets it down pat. The upgrades that you can purchase between runs is important, but everytime you beat a boss you will also be able to start from just after that battle. This negates the slough that so many rouge-likes have of fighting through earlier, weaker levels and repetative bosses.Neon Chrome feels like a nostalgia trip to old, top down arcade shooters. It retains the greatness of a bygone era while still using some key features of modern indie gaming. If you like top down shooters or rouge-likes, this is a game to consider."

The gameplay involves trying to make it to the top of the tower using your supply of cryogenically frozen people. Each run is randomized which makes the game extremely replayable, and you get to keep any credits earned to buy weapons, stat increases and other goodies to help you with your runs. Every five floors is a boss battle which once beaten, allows you to take an elevator directly to the next floor on any future runs.I really enjoyed the graphics, style and setting of this game, making it one of my favourite cyberpun games at the moment.I would prefer if controls had the option to always walk towards the cursor and strafe around it instead of always moving relative to the screen as I feel this makes top down shooters easier to control."

,Recommended,428750,22692625,"Posted: 28 April, 2016",all,Canadian Guitar,"Neon Chrome is a top-down twin stick shooter with rouge-like elements set in a a cyberpunk future full of bright colours, from the 10tons Ltd, the delevopers behind the cult classic Crimsonland. There are a lot of influences from their previous title here, but they also were not afraid to branch out a bit, and make something new, without having a cookie cutter game too similar to their last.The game's controls are pretty standard for that of a twin stick shooter. Whilst looking at your character from a top down view, one hand (or stick) controls movement, and the other controls aiming and shooting. Unlike a few twin stick shooters I have played, there is also a melee button, and more unlike other twin stick games, the melee is actually quite useful and powerful. The game can be played with a Mouse and Keyboard setup, or with a controller (although I haven't tried it with a controller yet), and with other controllers, can be played by up to four people in a Local Co-op setting.In the game, you are playing a hacker, who is using ""assets"", basically blank slate people/bots to assault the Neon Chrome facility. The facility is run by the Overseer, who is evil for some such reason and has a bit of dialouge at the beginning, and a few levels here and there. I'm sure once you progress more, his character gets flushed out a bit more, but I've only got a bit over two hours in it, and haven't progressed that far yet. These assets are what you play as, and use to assault the facility; every time you die you are taken back to a small room where you (the hacker), have a few terminals available to you where you can upgrade your character(s), look at what you've unlocked (weapons, cybernetics,etc) and choose your next assest to play with. There are a few different classes of assets, but three will be randomly available to you each time you spawn. Classes include a Techie, who has a rechargable shield and more energy than the others, but less overall health, an Assassain who in the shadows is harder for enemies to spot and detect and several more. Each class will also have a different weapon and ability each time, so sometimes it's best to pick a class for a weapon you like, rather than a specific skill set. As you progress though the game, you will be collecting money from dead enemies, or from looting various items you come across. This money can be spent at some of the other terminals to upgrade your assets after your death, but before you pick a new asset to use. The upgrades are Health, Damage, Luck (increases cash you pick up and rarity of loot), Energy (used for your abilities; shockwave, missles,etc) and Slots (which determines how many cybernetic upgrades you can carry [explained later]).Once you've picked an asset, you will then be able to pick which floor you start on, 1 through 6, but you can only start at floors 2 and higher once you have reached them at least once. Between each set of floors are different levels, all randomly generated, between floors 1 and 2 are three levels, 2 and 3 are five, and more are added between higher level floors for a total of 31 levels. There are bosses that seperate each floor as well, and can be quite difficult. You will spend some time dying and ""buying"" your way to better stats to take them on easier. You will spawn in an elevator in each level, and be looking for a green one to proceed to the next. Through each level, there will be various enemies and traps (laser fields, mines and the like), as well as boxes to loot for money, and crates with weapons and/or cybernetic upgrades and each time will be different, as the levels are randomly generated. The cybernetic upgrades are essentially perks, and are found in small capsules you walk in that are randomly placed in the levels. Once you activate it, you have a choice from three random ones that you get to keep for the duration of this assest's life. The perks include things like faster rate of fire and more damage, more melee damage, move faster and many many more. There are 50 perks altogether, but most of them must be found in other crates while you progress, and some perks can only be found on certain floors (so you can't get amazing end tier perks just by playing the first levels over and over). After buying the upgraded slots for your asset you can have a maximum of 10, so you must pick wisely. There are also crates with different weapons to be found, and some crates that upgrade the loot level of weapons you will find (including the weapon you currently have), giving them more damage. On some levels, there are alternate purple elevators (which you will see an alternate path between levels 5-6 for example, on the loading screen) which will take you to a sort of bonus level, each has it's own sort of theme for a puzzle, and will you often be rewarded with a box containing a new perk to them go into your random pool for when you upgrade yourself.As far as variety goes, there seems to be quite a bit. There are 50 cybernetic upgrades, 16 abilities and 26 weapons that you can unlock and there are different sets to be aquired on different floors. There are lots of different enemies and traps/defense systems you will encounter, and of the two bosses I've faced so far, each was very different and had a unique method to sucessfully killing.The graphics won't blow you away, but the atmosphere and colours will. The game is called Neon Chrome, and for good reason, there are plenty of bright and flashing colours making the levels very vibrant and appealing. The game has pretty low system requirements so I can't really see anyone having any issues running this on max, and in my time I haven't had any frame issues or stutter at all. The game simply runs smooth, and lets you sit down and shoot stuff without worrying about how well it will run. The sound effects are also good, and the music is what you'd expect looking at a game like this - a very 80's style electronic and futuristic music.ProsExtremely fun and easy to pick upVery bright and colourful level designsRouge-like elements and lots to unlock will keep you coming backGreat variety in weapons and abilities/perks as well as enemiesFour player local co-opLots of destructible envrionments and objectsConsOnly one game mode (Crimsonland had various types of surivial modes in addition to the main quest)Local Co-op, would have loved if this had some online co-op, even if it was only for two peoplePerhaps a bit pricey for most considering the genre (16.99 CDN when full price)All in all, so far I love it. I put a ton of hours in their previous game both on steam, and long before that and I can see this gane will be the same way. I love the colourful art style, the music and all the variety in weapons and enemies. Although I wish it were a few dollars cheaper, I know I'll more than get my money's worth out of this game and will surely have double digit hours in this before tomorrow. This will be one of my favourite twin stick games for sure."

I had my doubts at first, it being a small game, but let me assure you, it's well worth the price.GAMEPLAY: Typical twin stick shooter action in this one. It is a roguelike, so there is an additional exra element of difficulty involved from the get-go. You have a variety of classes with different starting perks, and randomized weapons/assets to pick from before diving into the levels. Each one is randomized as well, so you never play the game the same way twice. Combat is intense and grabs you by the face and forces you to pay attention. You can choose from a variety of ways to play, whether tactical or guns'a blazin' and you can pull off wins either way, depending on how you fight. The level of creativity this game allows was quite a treat for me.The item that stuck out most for me in this game, is that the difficulty is not impossible, but not a walk-in-the-park either. It's just enough to challenge you, and make the game fun. Boss fights in particular make sure you don't get too uppity and feel too good about yourself.GENERAL: Graphics are very good, and definitely catch the eye. As the title somewhat suggests, there's a lot of bright neon lights thrown throughout levels and just as added detail to make the environment enjoyable. Audio is amazing. Music is nice (can get repetitive after a bit, but I find it useful to just turn off the in-game music and play my own in the background), and the combat sounds (such as grenades exploding and guns firing) are top-notch. Very satisfying to hear.CONCLUSION AND EXTRA NOTES: All in all, an amazing game, that will be sure to get you to waste a lot of time on. I didn't expect Neon Chrome to be all that great, in all honesty. However, I was very pleasantly surprised. The devs went above and beyond for this one, and really highlighted on all the gameplay and audio stuff that really gets me into the feel of the games I love. 9/10 cannot recommend enough.NOTES: Multiplayer is kinda funky. The game apparently supports up to 4 players, but I have only managed to get 2 player co-op on my PC, as only one of our controllers is recognized by the game. However, the co-op experience is very good as well. I personally prefer using the mouse and keyboard to play, but controller works just as well."

So far I've only gotten to the Hovertank, but I'm definitely enjoying it.Edit: I've beaten it for the first time, so I can make some of these things a little more accurate.The Tl;Dr is that this game is a Cyberpunk Rogue Legacy with a ""linear"" map progression. I say linear map progression, because you generally have to go to floor 1, then 2, etc, but the floors are different every time.For everyone else, it's a top down rogue like shooter. You play as super hacker who is trying to take down an evil corportation. You do this by sitting in a chair, picking a bot/person from a list, and sending them forth into the levels. You get to pick from three different people that are random. The more weapons and abilities you find, the more diverse your picks can become. There are also static upgrades, so you can give your units more health, energy, luck, damage, etc. These are static upgrades, if you get em, they stay. You can also buy a weapon, that you've unlocked, and you'll start with it on your next run, same with abilities.Another neat thing I noticed was that completing achievements nets you in game money. It's not a lot, but 1200 credits can still be a few levels, depending on how early in the game you are.This game can feel a little grindy, but that's the just nature of the rogue like.A small note is that this game felt VERY weird to me initially. The controls are very simple, but there is no dodge, which I thought was weird. After the first hour, I adapted, and the game is awesome.After you beat the game, it'll kick you to the equivalent of new game plus. You can swap between difficulties at any time, which is a really cool design choice. Over all, still a fantastic game.I'd totally recommend if you're a fan of rogue like games with progression.The music is also really awesome."

I don't like this game, and I'll be refunding it after this review is written.That being said, I think many people will like it, so I do recommend it. I'll try to explain the game, as well as why I don't care for it, then you can make your choice based on the kind of player you are.So, I love twin stick shooters. All the way back to playing Robotron 2084 in the arcades as a kid. I also really enjoyed 10tons last twin stick shooter as well, Crimsonland, which I've got on GOG.My thing is, when I play a twin stick, I want something fast and frenetic... something like Robotron, Crimsonland, Geometry Wars, Enter the Gungeon, Nuclear Throne... ""my problem"" with this game is pacing. It's almost like this just happens to be a twin stick controlled game, but isn't really supposed to be what you'd generally think of as a ""twin stick shooter.""In this game you're in cramped hallways and small rooms, and it often-times feels more as if it should be a top down stealth game as opposed to what it is. Although many times the AI is so dumb, stealth won't matter. A few times I've shot a soldier standing beside another, and his partner doesn't even react. Or missed and bullets fired right past them, but they just keep ""guarding"".The easiest way to sum this up is: Take Crimsonland, give it a neon, Bladerunner-esqe ambiance, an awesome soundtrack, and put it into cramped, mazelike quarters, shake in a little ""rogue-lite"" and you've got Neon Chrome. It's got the powerups and guns you find like Crimsonland. The bit of humor in their written summaries. Even the menu screens remind me of Crimsonland... The only thing this game doesn't have is all the fast action fun.If you want a bit more thoughtful, strategic twin stick shooter as opposed to your typical fun run 'n gun, definitely give this a try. It's got slick graphics, a GREAT soundtrack, and decent controls (I used an XBOX One controller while I played). And in some ways it does make you think a little more than probably any other twin stick I've played (how to navigate the levels, etc.) but be aware that may ruin the pacing of the game for you as well.All in all, I personally found it to be... not bad. Just not fast, not firing out both barrels... and not fun."

Weapons and special abilities make each play session fairly unique, as do procedurally-generated levels and hand-crafted secrets. The handful of enemies require different approaches in combat, but the shortness of the roster can wear in longer sessions. Not a game to put hours into in one sitting, rather a game you'll keep around and find yourself coming back to. Updates so far have been significant and in response to community feedback, hopefully they'll keep it up and toss in a mod/attachment system and a few more enemies (maybe some with weapon drops?) to keep it interesting."

Sparse 80s decor and lots of rain.Ghost in the Shell + Frozen Synapse + F.E.A.R. + System Shock + NeuroVoiderWith bossfights imported from Metal Gear but with the serious character of an Angband throwdown.This is a game is a twin-stick shooter about the ballet of CQB. You manually push a cybernetically enhanced pawn across a Frozen Synapse-like landscape after some sort of bizzare robot uprising / AI mental takeover. Some of the pawns are great, and here is a game where you can play a cyber-ninja in thermoptic camo, equipped with seeker rockets, a super-sword and a repeating shotgun with 24 rounds in the mag.It is about the long and lonely road through a very large building, one room entry at a time. It is intensely repetitive but never boring. The enemies are kind of dumb but that does not make it easy, and there is a good justification in the setting. (It's pretty questionable if they're fully themselves. You are a brainjacked meat puppet yourself, so it's got a certain abstract game-within-a-game aspect to it.)The way the enemies behave makes it almost a procedural puzzler at points, then you mess up and it's wild gunfire and swinging monokatanas. Bossfights are mostly positional puzzles / position control challenges, however, the bosses do have attacks that will insta you so don't get complacent.Worth your time if you wish you could take part in a lot of infantry combat in the milieu of Ghost In The Shell."

The soundtrack to me is mediocre at best, but not at all bad! It's best to use a controller playing this game since it's a top-down shooter and also easier with joysticks. Earn credits each level, spend credits on stuff, gain levels, get more tough. Every time you play this game it just gets better. The levels aren't the same if you die, so don't die! You just need skill Sponge-O! Plus in the same aspect it keeps things interesting. You'll see what I'm talking about when you play. There's not to much thought about how cool this game is, trust me, try it, play it. IF you can, choose a hacker, they're better in my opinion. There's also lots of classes of sodiers to choose from.

So I repeatedly put it off. Now that I've finally played it I realize I was missing out. It's an awesome game, and once you start playing you completely forget about the simplicity of the graphics. It's easily as much fun as any of the other twin-stick shooters mentioned above, plus it comes with a level/mod editor. I wish I knew how to mod, becasue after playing it I had some ideas of how to expand the game.Definitely worth the $15 price tag, and all the more impressive because the download is only 250 MB.
