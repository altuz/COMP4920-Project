There is another recording device like this I heard about that is free so I am going for that instead. I cannot reccomend this software to those who want better frame rate either. I know, I tried and the frame rate is no different from fraps. they both drop a certain amount."

,Not Recommended,428800,28963147,Posted: 2 January,all,Decent60,"I'm going to start off by saying that the Spec Requirements needs to be updated severely. In the description (which not a lot of people read) it lists a Quad Core i5 or i7 while the Spec Requirements only list ANY Dual Core. This is a significant difference.From what I can tell, this is not supposed to ""impact"" gaming by utilizing the CPU rather than GPU. On my system, it maxed out the CPU (all 8 cores) and caused significant frame drop upon recording a light-weight game. GPU utlization never toppled over 40% and that was just a one-time spike, average was 26%. Meanwhile, Xsplit uses 26% CPU and 21% GPU as average.During recording, both microphone, and game audio became desynched by as little as 5 seconds but with lengthier videos, it was 20 seconds.The settings for recording where a bit lacking but very good for such a light-weight program.The UI is very nice, both for Game recorder and Screen recorder.All-in-all, this program has great potential but needs a lot of core work to utilize the CPU better."

And when i tried to record windowed games the video was glitched out and it was 10 seconds long even when i recorded 20 min vids!Dont buy it! its a waste of money! There are so many better recording softwares than this....nevermind. It doesnt work with Garrys Mod doesnt work with Gang Beasts only worked with browser games like happy wheels!

Interface is useless and confusing, when you start recording , game will become unplayable because of lags, often crashes of software, even if you record video , clip would have less frames which you record, audio is also bad, stuttering and out of sync.Developers test your products before a release :)"

,Recommended,428800,22711923,"Posted: 29 April, 2016",all,Grandma Wilma Jenkins,Well my experiences aren't all that bad. The only problem I have with the program is that for me the game sound is too loud to do a game commentary.I have tried adjusting everything and its still no way to really adjust the computer sound. When I lower the sound on the actual game it sounds like theres a difference but then I can't really hear the game Im playing.So thats it. I like everything this program has so far. I really would like to keep it and continue to use it if this is fixed.This is good for anyone just recording the gameplay seperately then the problem I have wouldn't be a big deal. I just thought 2 in one would be great.

This non complicated, high resilution and obviously high frame rate. I do reccomend getting this because many free things don't work and arn't trustworthy but this one is cheap, safe (from my expiriance anyway) and perfect for recording games, normal computer screens and everything. I have a kinda bad laptop compaired from many gaming ones so I didn't think y laptop would have enough power to run this but it abslotly fine. I seriously recomend this."

The only issue, and in my mind is a big one, it promises to record with your webcam at the same time. I could not get this feature to work. What is worse is I even tried to get ahold of Tech support with it. I never got a reply.If you are in the market for just game recording then I find this software to be alright."

Of course, I expected a free upgrade, but I had to pay for it. Well, it was worth.The thing I like about this product is the simplicity. I tried the OBS and others, but for a gamer, not a professional broadcaster, they had just too many abbr (yadadamean).No regreat on the $15 I spent on this. I just need to start the game and press Start on litecam and I start messaging the guys to watch me. That simplicity is exactly what a guy like me need.Great job, litecam!"

And why is my cam see through? And why doesn't it know flv format, or idk avi is huge compared to xsplit. game capture mode is missing the options... can't figure out how to add camera to it. I''ll check streaming and idk what happens if it crashes, but the layout is pretty awesome. If mp4 needs a new codex, how come we don't have that? idk how that works. The wav showed my voice picked up, but nothing recorded? I suggest trying this, or try xsplit which actualy detects what game you're in and can capture from only that if you want. if heavy 100 fps or so also means a  file that's 20gb. I won't be able to use it, but I'm sure others can."
