,Recommended,428880,19844108,"Posted: 22 December, 2015",all,Agent Cooper,"Wonderful grid-based first person RPG that feels like it came straight from the golden age of such games.Don't be fooled by this game's iOS/mobile background and your (honestly, completely reasonable) preconceptions about games made for such platforms! The Quest is one huge, deep, and exceptionally well-crafted RPG experience.Large and beautiful open world that truly feels like it was carefully hand-crafted, one that is rich with nostalgic fantasy atmosphere and filled with loads of interesting locales to discover, dungeons to plunder and quests to solve (which often can be done in more than one way, or sometimes in a way that is connected with other seemingly separate quests). Game features a reputation system where your fame/infamy increases or decreases depending on your actions and way in which you complete quests, which in turn can influence your future quests and your interactions with some of the game's NPCs.Combat is fully turn-based, highly enjoyable and deceptively simple. Game offers deep and open character customization, wide variety of equipment and spells, and sufficiently deep alchemy system. It's definitely a kind of game where trying out a vastly different character build is a good enough reason for a full-fledged replay.This new re-release comes with a fully redone HD visuals, and I must say that team did a pretty good job there: game looks -gorgeous-, at times almost like a beautiful hand-drawn fantasy illustration, fully retaining its original charm reminiscent of 90s games that influenced it."

I used to bug my brother until he would let me play this on his iPod.This game is story rich, and content rich. I'm a huge fan of the style of gameplay and the world is huge too.If you're not sure about buying this, maybe try out the ""lite"" version on iOS first.  This version has updated HD graphics, customizable controls, and is super nostalgic for me. If you're a fan of old style RPG's get this game!"

I played the game originally on IOS back in 2008, but don't be fooled, this game is not like the mobile games of today. The Quest came from a time before microtrasactions and dumbed down mobile games. This game is a true RPG and a complete game. This new version was remade mostly from scratch to have higher graphical fidelity than the original release. I have put in hundreds of hours on the old version of The Quest. The game is fleshed out in many respects, with in depth character creation in which race choice matters, a custom enchantment system, alchemy system, tons of spells, and tons of content. If you love old school RPG's, or new school RPG's like Legend of Grimrock, you will like this game."
,Recommended,428880,20416908,"Posted: 9 January, 2016",all,FuzzieBoy,"While this game's origins are on mobiles and PDAs, don't let that put you off; it's from a time before microtransactions and wait timers plagued these games. In fact, it's always felt like a game that would be at home on PC. And it is.The Quest feels like an homage to the dungeon crawlers of the late 80s and early 90s, with player choice firmly leading the way. Nearly every quest will have multiple ways to solve it, and the idea of what's good and bad is constantly foggy due to the fame system. As opposed to a meter telling you if you're a saint or sinner, you get a meter of fame, which decreases when it looks like you've done something bad, and increases when it looks like you've done something good. This may sound like the same thing, but sometimes the person you're sent to ""rescue"" doesn't want to leave, and was actually forced into a life they hated back home. Sure, getting them back would give you fame - it looks like you're helping - but is it really the right thing to do? This system really changes up how you approach your tasks, as it's not uncommon for what looks like the right thing to do to actually lose you fame - those in power have influence, but often tainted morals.On top of that, the combat has surprising depth to it as enemies seem to be able to have all the resistances and weaknesses you do, and finding these out can really be the difference between life and death. This really makes scraping through some of the tougher fights - even those fairly early on - really satisfying. Dungeons - while often fairly small - contain traps to disarm and secrets to find. Even potion crafting is fun to play with when you get some levels in alchemy, as some combinations of ingredients will have some unexpected results, and stumbling into one of these when you need it the most is so, so relieving. Everything you'd expect from a first person grid based CRPG is right here, and executed brilliantly. On top of this, the attention to detail is often staggering: even your outfit changes how people interact with you, with fancier clothes letting you get more favour with the posher characters, but also causing the lower class citizens to often be not so friendly. There's even a small card game to play in the inns to earn money, which may seem simple at first, but can be quite involving, and is a very fun distraction when you start to set up massive attacks with your buffs, and some large attack combos. The game is really full of depth, and you shouldn't ever be lacking for something you want to do, as the writing - while sometimes imperfect - does enough to make you actually want to help the characters who need it.Though not everything is perfect. My main complaint would be that there's really no way to escape a melee enemy that's too strong for you - you have to let them hit you once to figure out they'll destroy you, and from then they'll shadow your movements. They'll even follow you all the way back to a town, and just stay infront of the guards, who will do nothing to help, making you essentially trapped. While this is less of an issue when you get the paralyze spell, it's still quite annoying until then. But quite frankly, this is nitpicking more than anything else, and not enough to dampen my enjoyment of this game at all. Highly recommended to all CRPG fans."

Now that its got Steam Workshop support its an even better value.  Keep in mind what it is, its a retro-style, hack and slash, Dungeon Crawler / Fantasy World type game that had a smaller budget but programers who cared bout what they were making and put their heart into it.  Its got lots of quests that can be solved different ways. Lots of character build options (Some of them harder to play then others) My only complaint about the game was that I couldn't access areas of the game I could see, that were one level higher then the ground level.  If your looking for Skyrim, don't bother, but if your looking to have a fun time in a interesting fantasy world, you can't go wrong here."

DaggerFall is one of my most favourite games ever and have been looking for similar games. The Quest nails the old school game style and the reworked art gives a taste of modern efforts ( though i prefer the older visuals).While the Quest is honestly rather simple compared other games of the same nature like ""The Legend Of GrimRock"" 1 & 2 or the the formentioned DaggerFall- it still holds its own and will eat up hours of your time, plus it's great for a entry point into games like this.However this is  a game formula the often calls on the ""Love it or Hate it"" conondrome, not to much hand holding here, and so it's best you do some research on the games i just mentioned and know what your getting into- i mean 10 dollars is 10 dollars.P.S(this game is Turn based, unlike DaggerFall)."
,Recommended,428880,19911829,"Posted: 24 December, 2015",all,raixel,"Wow. Like a lot of people I was turned off by the ""was on mobile/pocket PC"". But the game had such good reviews, I had to try it out. And I'm really glad I did. The best way to describe it is TES mixed with the mid-generation Might and Magics - World of Xeen era. (I love MM 4-7. I even like 8 too) It really feels like a good turn based/semi realtime game from the mid 90s. And I mean that in the best way possible. Graphics are colorful, bright, and appear hand drawn in a well done mid-90s style- People move about, and clicking on things in the viewscreen allows you to interact. You can pick flowers & herbs, look at signs, examine things, talk to people (or sneak around from behind and steal), and so on and so forth. You can even read books. Some contain short stories, some useful alchemy recepies you can make from the herbs collected out wandering around. Personally, I love that. I'm one of those weirdos who's read literally every single book in TES.Combat is handled through a turnbased system on the overworld map kind of like M&M. IE - an enemy moves on the same overworld map as you, it doesnt go into a combat screen. They can even snipe at you from a distance with a ranged weapon. I was out screwing around in the wilderness, and all the sudden I started taking damage. I looked around, couldn't see anything. I took a step and got hit again. I saw movement, and realized an f'n archer was sniping at me behind a bush. I ran at her and she actually dodged out of the way so I couldnt hit her. Not bad. Once you get close, the game goes into a turn based mode, noticable by the fact that there appears to be a slight lag as the triggered enemy(s) move or attack. You can move(turning in place is free)/attack, then the enemy(s), then you. You are free to go wherever, so if you dont want to fight, just take off in the opposite direction and hope you're fast enough to get away.Theres plenty of people to talk to and sidequests so far. My one complaint about that is although there is a journal system for actual quests, there isnt an ingame note system where you can type simple notes to yourself for info that may be related to your quests. So if someone tells you ""the mayor's house is in the Northwest"" or ""I heard the smuggler (name) has a secret tunnel hidden in the SW of (place), you better write it down or remember it, the game wont remember it for you even if its a clue directly related to an in-journal quest.The class and skill system is pretty cool for a game like this. Its completely customizable. You pick a basic race, and are free to pick a base class. Then you can tweak the skills you start with however you want. Want a necromancer mage that steals and dual wields light weapons? You got that. A ranger that sneaks around and specializes in mind magic and heavy weapons? Yep.Another cool thing is based on your starting character, you start in a slightly different area of the game with a slightly different intro book. Its a nice touch.In the inn theres a nice little card game you can bet money with.  There are 3 decks to choose from, each deck has slightly different style cards. The object is to play a card every turn and drop your opponents HP to 0 with attack and DoT cards while keeping yourself alive with defense and healing cards. Its a fun little diversion.The sound is the one part the game isnt that great in, but thats fine. Not much sound at all, steps on hard surfaces, rustling in the woods and just a thwock-oof (or other appropriate monster noise) when you hit or are hit in combat.Overall, this game is a surprising little gem. Anyone who loves the mid-90s style RPGs should take a look at it. Its surprisingly complex and nothing like what youd expect from a ""mobile game"". My one concern with that is I'm wondering how long the game actually is, I mean they did such a good job on such a restrictive platform I'm wondering if they had to sacrifice content?"
76561198048664644,Recommended,428880,20430847,"Posted: 9 January, 2016",all,Pagan_PL,"Greetings dear Players!I have an opportunity to write here my thoughts and impressions about The Quest - An adventure, open world rpg game with old-school tile movement.  Let's start from my personal words of admiration.  In these days where AAA titles rules on the market, there are also developers like Redshift who brings to live that old-school, almost forgotten kind of games -Games with soul. For these of You who remmember old games times, this one is a must-have. And for these who not? Well, look at those wonderful screenshots, isn't it Beautiful? Of course graphic is the one thing. Gameplay is similar to other rpg's except movement. Our hero may walk in any direction but there is no slants. There is no mouse free look. That's what I love in this game. I can focus on what is in front of me instead annoying mouse hover-overing around. :) Of course game have mouse control as well. You may walk freely wherever You want, talk to anyone, take and complete quests and fight of course! Lot's of fight.Combat is turn based. Quests may be solved in two ways. One way is good, other bad. It is Your decision which way to choose. Will You be a good and kind person or simply a thief? It's up to You.For these who like a little experience grind I have good news! Enemies respawn after a few days in game! Loot is random. There is also many herbs which help You in Your quest.If You will have enough alchemy skill, will be able to create many useful potions!What's bring my attention was clear and good looking interface. The Quest have a well made one! I like also the font of the game as well. Music is very good. I enjoy to listen main menu track just for relaxation.This is a solid, well done RPG game with truly gorgeus hand-drawned graphic. It's worth the price! No cons from me.Try it - won't regret it!"

Personally, I am very happy I found this gem on Steam. Hate to think of what I would have missed if I had passed it up. What first attracted me was the handdrawn art seen in the screenshots. ""The Quest"" is a beauty and also very fun.Older titles that come to my mind are Might and Magic 3/4/5. However, ""The Quest"" formulates its own style in both atmosphere and mood, and it does not feel too much like M&M or really any other title I know. If Redshift has modelled the mechanics of their game after some other title that inspired them, then it's one that I have yet to play. Suffice it to say, I enjoyed ""The Quest"" immensely and I am very much looking forward to the promised sequel. The stories in both the main game and its expansion captivates with numerous twists that kept me questioning the motives of the more important characters you are forced to interact with. There are plenty of interesting moral choices to be made both during the main questline or during sidequests which might prompt a reload of your save just to see the effects of what happens when you act differently. Atleast that is what I did - often. :) Playing cards at the inns is another addiction.Also, technically, the interface in this game is simple in a positive way and allows you to focus on gameplay rather than zillions of statistics or needless tabs that serve no practical purpose. Its nice for a change. What I am saying is basically that ""The Quest"" is easy to get into but hard to put down. Frequent patches has also killed of most bugs reported and I did not runt into as much as a single issue while playing. 100 % stable.I could go on about everything else I like about this game but other reviews might might say it better or offer other more detailed perspectives on various aspects of gameplay I haven't covered here. It's not a game for everyone but rather a matter of taste (as with everything). Still, if you approved of the older M&M - or similar - then I don't see why you should dislike ""The Quest"". The island of Freymore awaits.Hail Mersant!"

The biggest problem with the game is that the quest log doesn't keep updates on your quests, so if you forget what you're supposed to do next, you're probably screwed.  Any other problem is a minor annoyance, and there aren't many.  It would be nice if it explained how things were calculated so I could make more informed of decisions, but the game's not very hard, so it doesn't seem to really matter in the end."

Be prepared for spending many hours exploring, fighting, playing cards in the Taverns and eventually solving the main quest of the game.  I finished the game in just under 40 hours, however I still have more of the map to explore, and want to play as a full Mage class on my second run of the game.Difficulty is very well balanced in the beginning and middle game.  At the beginning you feel powerless, as you should, but gain a few levels and things begin to even out.  Still you will be have to use strategy to defeat your foes depending on your build.  My physical fighter had some difficulty with magic based attacks...higher level enemies in particular can destroy you especially with lightning attacks.  Still there are many ways to buff your character to overcome this.My only criticism is I felt the end game was a little too easy.  In the game you can enchant items buffing your stats considerably which does take away some of the challenge.  Enemies don't scale to your level (which I like), and you get good satisfaction slaughtering enemies that gave you trouble in the early game.  Enemies also respawn after a while (a week?) which helps you to gain more experience and precious gold.  Be wise with your money...I ended up with just over 4000 gold at the end game after amassing over 20000 gold throughout the game.So yeah this is a pretty special game, that will appeal to those who enjoy turn based combat, grid movement and games like the early Might And Magic series.  I really look forward to the sequel and if possible an expansion to this game would be a great addition.  The Quest is a first class game from beginning to end."

All games should strive to be this detailed and interesting. If you ever feel the need for a good old role play, dungeon crawl, or just have a love for video games, this game is for you. The story is really good, and each quest has great writing and isn't just some fetch quests. The NPC's really bring the game to life. This game is definetely a must buy, and I would snag it early during the sale. As you can see by my play time, I've been playing it non-stop since I bought it. A drawback to the game however, is that it is sorta hard to start off. It is a little complicated at first with all the character building, and you being thrown in the middle of a town to fend for yourself and find quests. I'd recommend the guides Sylon compiled in the official RedShift Forum. There is a button in the menu screen to get there, but I'd recommend using the steam overlays browser functionality to have the ability to open guides at any time. Keep in mind though that pressing shift within the game is the attack button, so when you open the overlay press tab first so you don't trigger an attack.You wouldn't believe how many times I've accidentally hit someone while opening the overlay and having to pay off the fine. Anyway with all that said, The Quest is a great must-immediately-buy game, and while it's on sale you can't go wrong with buying it! Hope it wins an award!"

It's very similar to the classic Might and Magic games such as MM3 and World of Xeen but with a little more depth in the skill system. So far the difficulty level seems just right. One difference from the Might and Magic and The Quest is that you play solo in this game. There are no party members, but it's still pretty fun playing solo. You will meet interesting characters, browse through shops with many goodies, and crawl through dangerous dungeons! I'm also liming the art in this game, it fits it well. The Quest is also turn based with grid movement which is a huge perk IMO. So, do yourself the favour and buy this gem! I recommend this game to any CRPG and Might and Magic fan. 10/10!"

That being said, they are unique unto themselves. I have nothing negative to say about them.Gameplay: While it is true that it reminds me of Eye of the Beholder/Dungeon Master series, I find it a bit more akin to Dungeon Hack with a solo character. Characters are solid; however, I would love to see more attributes or ways to customize my character further.Complaints:(1)Quests are extremely vague with no markers or map assistance. I end up usually roaming to fill in the map, then happen upon the areas. Additionally it can be tricky to figure out how to clear them. Some might disagree, but I enjoy quest markers of some sort.(2)This one is a personal preference, since I prefer real time combat. When a monster gets into range you go into ""slow-mo mode"" where your movement is reduced to 1 square at a time, with the enemies responding to each movement.  Battles seem to drag on at times with you moving around to get them stacked up on a same square."

The best way I can describe this is if Skyrim was put into an old RPG engine.If you've played the game on ios or android, it's pretty much the same, only the graphics have been massively inproved as has the framerate.The only downside to this game I can think of is that if you drop an item that's required for a quest and the item disappears, you cannot finish that quest.

Aside from copying some things right out of those older games (I swear i recognize some of the assets... maybe its not the same, but very similar if not); I feel the dungeons are tiny and the world in general feels small.I do like the character creation and progression a bit, and there was some neat new principals; (like resting in the rain reduces how well you recover). But that also feels limited and battles are really simple and repetitive. What happenned to things like ""attacks per rounds"", blocking, tactical spells like fog walls (great against archers) and maybe setting up traps. Speaking of traps, why don't I have the option to try disarming any of them. I see floor traps like in old RPGs, and just like in 1991, I cant do♥♥♥♥♥♥about them.I also felt like the item enchanting was taken right out of Morrowind.

I bought this back then a little while after its release as the style of gameplay reminded me of older turn / tile based RPGs such as Daggerfall.The gameplay is addictively fun and simple, you can move quickly over tiles whilst out of combat but when within range of another enemy the speed slows down to help you plan your next move, take a potion or choose a spell to fire. The story is nicely written and interesting to get involved with and the music is very relaxing when exploring towns and forests and equally immersive in dungeons.There were a number of expansions for The Quest that were released on iOS that all expanded on regular gameplay and were also playable standalone, I'd like to see them make an appearance on the PC port as well."

It has a distinct ""indie"" look to it at first glance and drowns in a sea of lower priced indie games fighting for your attention.  But let me tell you if you have even the tiniest nostalgic bone in your body, you are doing yourself a great favor in picking up this game!  I am quite a fan of the older RPG games, particularly games like the Elder Scrolls Daggerfall, Lands of Lore and the Might and Magic and Wizardy series of games.  The Quest hits those notes with plenty of charm to spare!There are the standard fare of classes and races to choose from, giving you the opportunity to tailor your own character to the style of play that you enjoy the most.  I personally set out as a mage, and I get all the right feelings from that, including feeling like a wimp at a low level.  Leveling up and purchasing better equipment actually feels to make a difference.  I am able to creep ever farther out into the dangerous wilds as bit by bit I get just a little better and wield better equipment.The imagery is nicely stylized and consistent throughout from what I've seen.  It does have that ""low budget"" sort of look which makes for unimpressive screenshots but once you immerse yourself in this world, you are easily lost in it and the funny looking features of the landscape don't bother you much.  It's the large world seemingly filled with exciting adventures that you here for after all!The controls have taken me a bit to figure out.  Some things aren't as intuative, like clicking on a crack in the floor sometimes opens up my inentory, as if it is a container, sometimes it initiates an attack, sometimes nothign happens at all.  And there doesn't seem to be any visual feedback to let you konw which will happen.   Because of this, it took me several play sessions before I wasn't accidentally attacking small children in town, or firing off a healing spell when I meant to look at my character sheet.  but given a bit of time, you will become familiar with the keyboard shortcuts.I think the lack of intuitive interface, or maybe I should call it ""hand holding"" actually lends itself to this game as a benefit.  I'm actually enjoying learning in a more natural way all of the different ways I can interact with the world I'm finding myself in.The music is nice and fitting for the situations. The sound effects are just fine.  I actually wince each time I'm minding my own business wandering through the forrest only to be ambushed by an amazonian looking archer woman.  The sound of her arrows thudding into me, and the sharp grunt my character makes me cringe every time.Don't let any doubts about first impressions keep you from picking up this game (as I did at first), you owe it to yourself ot get started on this exciting quest!"

If you remember dungeon crawlers from the 80's and 90's, and it was your favorite type of rpg, there is no way you won't love this.  Besides that, it is generally a fun game of exploration and item building, with a large map and decent storyline.  Also, it is an RPG with a real set number of foes in some areas.  This means when you conquer a region, the foes are little to none there after, which gives the game a little realism (and balance)."

For example my character had 100% magic and poison resist, and combined with heavy armor and high block, nothing much hurt me for the last 1/4 of the game. but you know what? I did not care. I still kept playing because I was enjoying the game so much. I could not wait to see what the next quest would be and what was around the corner. And that is what gaming is to me.

Still not done with the expansion...The game heavily reminds me of my old favourites like Might & Magic (especially before the change of universe), Elderscrolls (up till Morrowind) and even Arx Fatalis or Stonekeep. Though one should not await a game like the named ones, the quest is much shorter - but still long enough for it's price. The story is a well enough done fantasy stereotype one in an usual fantasy world, not that much dialogue, but a good chunk of quests - also some that can be solved in different ways. Very nice indeed is the fact that your reputation as well as your appearance influence how npcs react and how some quests work out. I would like more of that stuff!Usually I care not much about different races or classes, but about the freedom to build my character in a way i do like without to much restrictions. This game lets you do both ways: If you do not care much about tinkering around your charakters build, use one of the pre-defined classes (all the fantasy rpg stereotypes are there) - but if you like to brew your own stuff, that works pretty nice, too. The races do not play very different in my opinion except for the undead. Your class choices (or skill choices) weigh much heavier. I tried different charakter builds and it seems a warrior type plays a lot easier than a mage type...About skills: The game's skill system is pretty sophisticated both in the way skills are executed and how you level up. Three different weapon types (ranged, heavy and light) to combine with dual wield or shields, as well as light and heavy armour. The thieves skills I did not use as much - most can be duplicated by spells and you do not need lockpick and disarm or pickpocket that much overall. The magic schools are fine, though I did not find much use for mind magic, except in two or three quests where it came in really handy. I really liked the Environmental School/Enchanting and Alchemy - nice clone of Morrowind (which had the best so far imo). Your skills' max rank is based on the 5 attributes. Level up is standard rpg - get enough xp and you get a level, which means points for attributes and skills. Leveling up needs a lot of xp soon, so a bit of specialisation is in order. But since there are a lot skill trainers around and money is not much of an issue you get all skills to a decent level to use in quests, where they are sometimes checked.Up to now I did not encounter any bug and only two crashes, which I deem a very good ratio.Now the least important part about a video game - graphics and sound. Sound is fine, could use a bit more different tracks. The screams of dying outlaws are hilarious! Some people seem to complain about lack of animations, there really is not that much but for me that is no problem at all, since the hand-drawn graphics make totally up for that. It feels like the devs took the old rpgs pixelblurr and remade them in shiny HD-gems. I really love the Cyclops - looks just like the one in the old Sinbad the Sailor movies! The only drop of bitterness here: Not that much monsters and npcs (that is different drawings) in the base game and only a handful more in the expansion.Okay, lot of blurb...All in all it is a really good game and it has a lot of potential for expansions (as you can see with it's mobile versions), especially if the developers release an editor (which is planned as far as I know). And I think the devs / game / engine could do lot more - maybe with The Quest 2?Edit:Nominated for Steam Awards - you guys have earned it!"

Now that it's out on Steam, I'm excited to be picking it up again.The Quest is a perfect blend of single player, open world RPG and grid-based dungeon crawler. It has a lot more in common with, say, the Elder Scrolls series than it does with something like Lands of Lore. You're a lone hero, so there's no party to manage while you travel about the land of Freymore (something I adore about this game!). With a difficulty level that is completely spot-on, you'll be doing plenty of exploring, dungeon diving, character building, alchemy, and fighting as you work your way through the game's many quests.And the quests are really where the game shines. They are plentiful, well written, and almost never as they first appear. For example, an early quest has you seeking a boy to recruit as an agent of the kingdom...but shortly into the quest, it branches and gives the player multiple options for completion. Will you force him to come with you? Will you recruit someone else in his place? Player choice and twists like this are a common theme throughout the game and allow you to role play and build your character as you please. The depth is a refreshing departure from the ""kill 10 rats"" trope and really shows the care that went into crafting the world and its stories. It's even fun to tell friends the crazy stuff that happens because it's often hilarious and totally unexpected, and you don't always get that in RPGs.The game also received an HD facelift when it came to Steam, and the new art really works and looks quite charming. I've been able to run the game on multiple devices with different resolutions and have had no issues at all. On the other hand, the music and sound hasn't been updated. This is a non-issue for me since the music, albeit midi, is quite good, and the sound effects are perfectly serviceable. As a side note - the developer includes the old development version of the game, with the old graphics, for the low price of zero dollars.The developer also added a lot of convenience options like key rebinds, tool tips, inventory sorting, quick saves, cloud saves, touch mode and I'm sure a ton more I'm missing. It does a lot to bring the game up to date and it feels a lot more modern than it used to. They're continuing to release updates and fixes to the game as well, and it's obvious they are listening to the community. My wishes include getting the expansion content - and mods - in addition to native controller support. This game would work amazingly well in Big Picture with a 360 controller!Suffice it to say that I'm totally impressed with this new version of The Quest. What I initially thought would be a quick port ended up being a developer's genuine effort to bring an old classic up to date and to a new audience. This does not feel like a mobile port in any way. It's a full-fledged and substantial PC release and I really feel it really has that ""special something"" that a lot of RPGs lack. I'll soon come back and spend even more time with it than I did on iOS. Here's to hoping the expansion content is released and that the Quest 2 gets made!"

Its a more hardcore rpg and there's no hand holding. There's no marker showing you where to go for quests. You have to read what the people say and use your brain to figure out where to go and there's a lot of puzzle solving.There's resources online if you get stuck. I know I felt overwhelmed with it when I first played the classic version many years ago, but i stuck with it and learned how the game works and now its one of my favorite games of all time!"

In this age of sometimes rushed games, and different systems....I find that highly suspicious. On ""EVERY"" other forum, that I have ever been on...the posts were put up either immediately or very quickly. I wanted people to be aware of this, should they run into problems, and Heaven forbid, need to look for an answer on their forum.

It was released pretty much as a direct port from the original. The developer who works on it is really only doing bug fixes and minor enhancements to the original while working on the expansion/ sequel.It is very enjoyable if you are into this sort of game. Walk around doing quests and either smacking monsters upside the head with really big weapons or frying them to a crisp.It works really well. Loads quick and is stable unless you alt/tab out at which point it usually crashes when you try to go back to it. Since the game loads and saves so quick it isn't a huge drama and quite possibly a windows fault since windows works so incredibly well with everything. /sarcasm offThe developer is adding many features not seen in the ipod/ iphone version such as weapon swapping and improved armours.We wont see anything change dramatically but since release there have been daily patches with enhancements.It's really rather awesome to see an active developer.The game stands on its own merits.

Unfortunately quantity doesn't mean quality.+ Some quests have more than one solution.- The writing is very poor, forget about characterization or motivation.- There are perverted incentives regarding your build. If you want to build as strong a character as possible, you should first go play a boring card game to earn money for all trainers in the area and only then start playing the actual game. Actually scratch that. You should sneak and cheese your way to the capital, there play the card game and use the local trainers, because the card games there earn the most money and the trainers have the highest skill cap. If you don't first use all trainers, you are throwing away skill points for skills you could have bought.- There is only one save slot and the game overwrites it if you quit the game, even if you quit with Alt+F4 in the middle of a conversation! Barring some manual file copying there is no way to load an earlier save. Forget about trying multiple quest solutions in one playthrough.- You can always tell when you're in combat mode because the game starts stuttering during your movement.- Your boots break simply by walking.There are some usability issues, probably stemming from the game being a mobile first:- Sometimes you pick up and use stuff with a spacebar, sometimes with a mouse click.- You cannot rebind the Tab key- You cannot close the inventory with an Esc key- There are no loadouts, if you want to switch from a sword to a bow, prepare to click, click, click in the inventory.For a mobile game this is not bad.

I love the hand drawn graphics and  the general athmosphere of the game. Writing is really good, with a hint of cheesiness, which makes me just smile.I recommend this game to anyone who likes RPG games. There is lots of things to do in this game: Lots of quests, lots of books to read, places to explore.. I also love how I can leave notes on the map!"

The world is large, the combat balance is tight, and the quests offer surprisingly in-depth role-playing decisions, with real repercussions based on your decisions. Overall it's exactly what you'd want and expect, as advertised... plus a little more. Good game!"

Sure I know some people would have lower standards of questing. It gets boring after 3 hours with the plain combat and the quest itself are not really in-depth or interesting. Wish I could just give it a rating of out of 10 on Steam, be more accurate than just a recommend or not recommend.5 out of 10."
,Recommended,428880,35458728,Posted: 3 October,all,SilentCandle,"""Gem"" Is a good word for this game. Really is. Mages seem to blitz through the early game, I like it. Will edit my review as I play more, if need be. 9/10, mostly because of price.PROS- Make whatever character/class you want out of many choices- Play many many different ways- Explore a pretty big world with ultimate freedom- Tons of loot, enchant gear with whatever bonuses you want- Undead magic is pretty unique (anti-living magic)- Devs are awesome and answer your questions- A story that's there, but not in your face- Good musicCONS- Can't be super evil (you can steal, but you can't kill innocent NPCS) that I know of... I want to murder those town guards for telling me I'm a stinky undead b****- I wish there was more magic, like ice magic, or ways to flame your weapon.- Magic gets Mana intensive. (My Rasvim Mage is chugging mana potions like an undead alcoholic... Killing the living must be thirsty work.)"
