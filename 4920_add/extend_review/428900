,Recommended,428900,32546401,Posted: 18 June,all,CorvusCorax,"A short little game with extremely fast-paced mechanics. It reminded me of a similar game I played on Android; in fact, I believe these types of games are generally typical of smartphones due to their simple way of controlling.Don't forget you need two things here to master each of the 4 levels Linea has to offer: very good reaction time and patience. It's one of those games that are not that long (which means achieving 100% completion is relatively easy), however, if you lack one of the aforementioned skills it'll take way more time to learn how to master it!I would have included some more levels (or the same 4 but with different difficulty selection), a little change in music as well as graphics options to be able to pick a different theme. But it doesn't mean I lacked these; I had fun and if you'd like to have a simplistic, challenging game Linea is there for you to help (or to assist in smashing your keyboard)."

I mean come on, the guy had roughly 50 words to translate and the part he did translate had mistakes(loser spelt with two o for instance).Edit: The translation mistakes have been fixed and i think some more text have been translated.After more time of playing it my point still stands, this is a very good game for its kind.

This clearly limits how fast you can go. Also not knowing how close you were to dodging is frustrating in a bad way.To me the controls are feeling not very responsive / natural. So you are not moving around really fast but pushing around a turtle.I have only played the tutorial and the first two levels, but they felt kinda boring. The first level only has 3 different patterns and the second level consists of blocks coming toward you. I have got to 45 seconds just by staying in the top, so it's boring as hell.Minor things: The soundtrack isn't very catchy and in the options menu you don't see your cursor if you use your keyboard.I would have liked to try some more levels to see if they are more fun, but you have to unlock them by beating the previous levels, so if you are stuck in a level you don't have something other to try."

Each level is somewhat randomly generated and the quota for finishing a level is surviving for 60 seconds. While each replay of a level is random, each does contain patterns that constantly show up to allow you to learn through trail and error to pass as those are usually ones that causes a game over.Despite the difficulty increase, each level is possible through constant replaying, and with this often comes the feelings of excitement as you pass your last high score/ beat the level, despair when you are 1 second away, or determination while playing.It does not show that it is controller supported, but it is and I do recommend playing with a controller. It makes it easier and faster to dodge and doesn't wear on the fingers like playing with the keyboard does.I also do recommend looking at the achievements, as one requires you to play the first level without doing the tutorial first (locking you out from the achievement if you play the tutorial first). The dev has added a launch option to reset by demand (however this resets everything in the process).Overall, I recommend this game, but be warned this game is harder than it looks like and be ready to die a lot."

76561198038132122,Recommended,428900,33843113,Posted: 27 July,all,ForestWolf,"Rating: mediocre (5/10)IntroductionLinea is a minimal reaction game where you have to dodge objects for at least 60 seconds. Main game contains 4 levels during that you listen to funky bitpop music.Gameplay & Story: 5/10There is no story in Linea and the whole gameplay consists of only dodging platforms and incoming objects to survive more than 60 seconds. The game feels smooth and reacts well to user's input. The control consist of only pressing WASD or the arrow keys to control the camera.Combat & Challenge : 7/10The challenge of level 3 and level 4 is what makes this game so much fun. The first level is only for introduction, second showing that it will get harder while the third starts to actually take few tries to get past it. The fourth level took me about an hour of total tries since you have to concentrate for 60 seconds straight and its not that easy when colours flashing all in a quick manner all the time.Graphic & Interface : 5/10The interface is absolutely simple containing only the needed buttons for starting a leve, checking achievements and high score and the settings. The graphic is containing only the needed elements to play the game, so not much to rate here.Progress & Mini-Games : 4/10The progress felt nice for the levels existing, but I would definetely have enjoyed more levels and a bit smoother progression. The hit from 2nd to 3rd level was quite hard and level 4 felt at the start quite impossible. After a while you get the hang of it, but still compared to 2nd level there are world between. Smoother progression in challenge would have felt much better.Audio & Immersion : 6/10The tracks were not bad, but something for bitpop fans. I turned the volume off at the fourth level since it felt like being distracted by then. The immersion happens only when you are really into playing a quick level but for such a mini-game talking about real immersion would be silly.Side-NotesThis game is single player only.This game contains steam achievements.This game contains steam trade cards.This game is really short - I finished all the levels and got almost all achievements in 2 hours playtime. Progress can be reset anytime if you want to repeat the game however.This game offers some replayability if you want to retry some levels.SummaryI would suggest to get this game if you want to try your reactions, since 3rd and 4th levels are quite hard even for a hardcore gamer. The bitpop tracks are quite fun to listen to for the first time. It gets some time getting used to the level styles and way of dodging the obstacles, but once you figure them out its fun retrying to get best highscore and compete on the ladder list.Short playtime and lack of replayability are the biggest minuses, however since the price is not that high either, the game is still recommended.I hope this review helps you making the decision if its worth buying this game. Rate and leave a comment if you enjoyed reading it.~ForestWolf"

,Recommended,428900,23019786,"Posted: 16 May, 2016",all,Joshyy,"Linea, the Game is a minimalistic dodging action game akin to Super Hexagon. The premise of the gameplay comes from a series of red bars that move towards your screen, normally in one of the 4 directional positions (up, down, left, right). The object of the game is to dodge these red bars and survive for as long as possible. (60 seconds minimum to progress to the next level.) The gameplay is supplemented with minimialistic white and gray backgrounds, and fast-paced chiptune music.Each stage has its own music track, so repetitive plays on the same level can cause the music to grow stale. The patterns for which objects appear don't seem too varied, so they become easier to pick up as the stage is repeated.The difficulty ramps up as you progress through stages; the first few levels are relatively drawn out, enabling an understanding of the mechanics of the game. Once the player reaches stages 3 and 4, the tempo and difficulty increases. There is also currently a DLC pack with 3 extra stages and a bonus coin collecting stage, also with increasing the difficulty from the last stage of the game.Overall, I was able to complete the game in one sitting. Replayability seems low, as the stages don't seem to increase in difficulty regardless of time. Those that are quite fond of these types of games are likely to have short play times as well, while newer members might find a challenge with the later stages. I was able to pick up both the game and DLC for 2 dollars, and received 1.5 hours of play time.Will recommend for the low price of the bundle coupled with the quality of the game."

,Recommended,428900,29593668,Posted: 30 January,all,Titanic21,"Just some short review for ""Intralism""'s brother... Or shouldn't it be sister?Nevermind. Linea, the game (The comma is a part of the name, NEVER dare to leave it out) is pretty much 2.5D Super Hexagon. It's not as good but also a lot of fun.While the first two levels are pretty easy, this game is pretty, pretty hard overall. As mentioned, use Super Hexagon, insert it into a 3D-printer, nail what you get onto a skateboard, push it right into the direction of a camcorder, motion capture the result and do some programming using the ""Unity-Engine"". This game's pretty much what you should get.Graphics are nothing special, but if you wanted a game with astonishing graphics you surely wouldn't be here, so this point is kind of forgettable.The soundtrack is not really my style, but it would be unfair to dislike it therefore. What I mean is that the melodies are quite catchy, but the chiptune-instrumentation pretty much ruin them for me, nevermind that.As already said, the difficulty is pretty... High. If you can't get enough of the main levels, buy the DLC. THEN we can talk again. I mean, there are harder games, of course, but in a scale of one  to ten i'd give Linea's difficulty level a 7,5. (Main game: 7; DLC: 8; external review coming in the future) Prepare yourself for some hours of training.Funny indeed are the achievements. You can literally gain half of them without really succeeding. That's not a joke, It happend to me exactly that way.

This is difficult as there is no guidlines to show if you are actually about to hit the shape or not. There is very little time to move and react to the incoming shapes and while all of this is going on, the background is a constant spinning optical illusion. The achivments are also shockingly easy to get. I got 4 achievments just by starting the game and going through the menus.I can't fault the game on it's price though especially when buying it during the sale for less than 40p. The music also is quite good; based off 80s/90s chiptunes.The game cannot overcome it's flaws and it really is a testamen to ""You get what you paid for"". There are many better free alternatives for this game such as The Missile Game 3D online."

Sadly, apart from the falling, this game is nothing like Aaaaa.Using a controller is far better than trying to use WASD to dodge, but even with the controller movements feel really sluggish.  Plus, the hitbox is ill-defined so you can't actually tell when it's safe to move back to center.  You have to dodge red and black bars with the middle of the screen, but where exactly does the ""middle"" end?  This results in you returning to center too soon or staying off-center too long that you can't dodge the next object. In short, you lose. A lot.  This would be bearable if there was a way to adjust the difficulty and make the objects approach you at slower speeds, but that is not the case.  Instead, most players will never finish the first level.In case you need another reason to avoid this game, the spinning border induces nausea, so that's reason enough not to bother.Pro tip if you do waste your time playing:Launch level 1 before you launch the tutorial.  You're welcome."

The core game is fast paced with minimal downtime, ensuring that you’re not doing much else but bashing your head against the game’s primary challenge. The minimal visual aesthetic is great to look at but also a punishing part of the core game, making it that much more difficult to visually distinguish everything on screen. Whilst it might not be my usual cup of tea I was surprised I played it for as long as I did, especially when I started craving after a few achievements.Read my full review here:https://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2016/01/15/linea-hesitation-will-be-your-end/"

I recommend using a controller.I dont know if I would have made the game without controller."

I highly recommend this game because it was difficult, but never had you repeating yourself too much. Each level was contrastive and hard for different reasons. The DLC was an added inducement which I thought was better and more gripping than the base game.  Pick this one up, you can afford it."
,Recommended,428900,35052801,Posted: 18 September,all,Tezlakipuka,"The graphics are very simplistic, the soundtrack is well done and relaxing. The levels offer a good variety of challenges.Controller support is flawless, and I highly suggest using one. The Keyboard controls felt way too unprecise for level 3 and 4.Be aware that there is a missable achievement when starting with the tutorial first. See the guides for more information. The DLC is not needed for 100% completion.Overall, Linea is worth its current price of 1,99€."

76561198355896078,Recommended,428900,34482936,Posted: 25 August,all,Axarional,"6/10it's a nice challenge for those who like fast-paced, reaction-based games and note that this is NOT for those looking for a casual game on the couch.I personally didn't mind the music despite being a metal fan, although i'm sure others will have their varying opinions on the music so i can't say that the music is bad/good.Gameplay was interesting when there was a different, given way to beat the level however overall i think the Dev should have given the player some sort of marker, like in the tutorial, showing them what space they occupy as it makes the core mechanic of the game, dodging, unnecessarily more difficult.Finally, while i did somewhat enjoy the game:TO THE DEVplease remove or at least, change the achievement where you had to play the first level instead of the tutorial. This is because after the player finishes the tutorial, they have to reset what they had done so far which is made only more painful since they don't know how to reset the game and/or find your guide on resetting which is located in the game forum. THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN."

,Recommended,428900,32758194,Posted: 24 June,all,Drizzle,"This is a basic reaction speed game where you use the four arrow keys (or wasd) to pilot yourself and dodge red beams. It's pretty fun, but if you're really good at such games, you'll blow away the 4 levels in no time.Wait... 4 levels? Yes, 4 levels. It has another DLC that adds 4 more levels for you. Buying the bundle costs a bit over 2 dollars. Do the math and that comes to 25 cents per level.All of these 8 levels are quite hard to the average player and can (and will) chip away at your time. It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of, but the feeling you get after beating one level is (sometimes) worth it.Is the game worth it? Well... that's debatable. If you're interested in such a game, go for it. Otherwise, try spending your money on something else that suites your liking."
