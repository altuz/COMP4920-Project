,Not Recommended,428950,23406443,"Posted: 5 June, 2016",all,Agentfly42,"When I first picked up this game, I was not sure what to expect. When all you know about a game is that it has to do with toilets and guns, there is much to be skeptical about. However, shortly after getting into the game I was pleasantly surprised by a simple, fun concept that provided what I would say was a good value, for a 99 cent game.Soon after reaching the first checkpoint, I experienced my first death. Restarting was no big deal, since I had made progress and I was okay with having to go back a few steps once a lesson was learned. What I did not expect (or enjoy) was the many, many deaths it took me to reach the next few checkpoints. I rethought my strategy several times, buying many different upgrades and never forgetting to refill on health and supplies. But checkpoints were few and far between, and dying became tedious and very unpleasant.Once, after barely cruising into a checkpoint, I dismounted my vehicle, weary and ready for another fight. However, instead of aiming for me, a resudial enemy from the road came in and destroyed my car, leaving me without a vehicle. Not built to handle this phenomenon, the game then had me walk for miles with no vehicle enemy spawns. Once I had reached the end of the road and arrived at the next town, I braced myself for the foot soldier attacks that would come before I could claim my checkpoint. However, they never did come. Since I had never dismounted my vehicle, the game had never been signaled to spawn the enemies for my battle!Unable to save and stuck with no action, I left to the main menu to try Test Drive mode, which had worked bug-free for me prior to my little dilemma. Upon entering of the Test Drive section, the game promptly crashed (which I suspect had something to do with my previous bug).That said, Kivi, Toilet and Shotgun is a great game for the price it's at. It's pretty fun, with a moderate replay value. However, the difficulty slant in this game along with the many bugs I have experienced make this review a downvote."

Choose your upgrades carefully, many complain that running out of gas is the big issue, well..they must not have realised that the use of nitro is imperative, if you dont use your nitro profitiently you will run out of gas. The game is still plagued with bugs and A.I. issues, for example I left my vehicle to walk ahead and deal with a few baddies and when I turned back the road, my vehicle, and just about everything dissapeared. Some times baddies get stuck off the screen and you have to assume you are shooting them. Rage quitting is inevitable. I also worry the devs. will abandon this game or not make much a priority out of it considering they are Armenian and most complaints must be translated. This game is pain staking however I am a masochist, are you o.O?"
,Recommended,428950,21197998,"Posted: 13 February, 2016",all,TreyGamr58,"I was browsing the most absolutely cheapest things on sale on the Lunar New Year Sale and I stumble upon this little thing. I mostly got it because I felt confident about spending for nearly anything after replenishing my steam wallet and that I really dig this kind of deserty wasteland theme.It was alright enough. I haven't played for that long or gotten too far but, from what I've played so far, I'm pretty sure it's good enough for a 99₵ pricetag. It does what it's suppose to do thoroughly and it doesn't hold your hand. You have to really think and be cautious when progressing and to also be aware about all the variables that you have to take care of. I've noticed that most of these other reviewers are saying that they can't get to the 2nd town because ""the game's unfair"" when they probably didn't upgrade their vehicle (repair vehicle if below 60, fuel up, attach 2nd AK turret, and maybe buy some off-road tires) and keep their distance from enemy cars.This game is more complicated than I anticipated and you need to plan out your journey so that you won't be relying only on the RNG. It does not have everything that it should. It should give you the ability to rebind some controls (the controls could take some getting used to), it's sort of luck based, the combat could be better and more built upon, and there's a major lack of toilets here.It's alright, especially for it price, it's not garbage, it is challenging (like how old NES games were challenging), and it may be a good distraction in between of doing things or waiting for a bigger game of yours to get patched.I may have only played around a halfhour but I don't regret this small purchase. Heck, you could probably just get a refund if you don't like it after a few sessions or go for the trading cards and make a profit of the marketplace. I know that I'm gonna keep this one around."

(You will barely take a scratch from the first boss, but regular enemies can drain your hp within seconds.) There is a lot of wasted potential and it feels like the devs abandoned it when they were halfway through.The items drop randomly, so if you are not really carefully how and when you speed up while driving and keep your distance to enemies, you will have a hard time to survive, because HP-Packs won't drop at all sometimes. Some of the items are not explained, so you have to figure it out on your own, what exactly they do.There are a few upgrades that doesn't make sense, since it would make the game harder. Why should i buy a pistol for my car, when it has an automatic rifle by default? You can beat the entire game with the automatic rifles (for the Car and Char). You won't need anything else.The balancing for the boss battles would really need some improvements and changes. The second boss is probably the hardest, while every other boss is rather too easy. You can even hit them, when they can't hit you and some of them are stationary.Graphics are okay for such a simple game and have some fine details.It could have a few more sounds. You don't even hear your car while driving.But beside all of that you can get fun out of it, when you like games of this kind and if you want a challenge that can be frustrating from time to time. The concept is good, but it has much wasted potential. It's hard to give a yes or no, since you can see some effort the devs put into that game, but it feels in many situations like they haven't finished their job."

It's hard, short, and occasionally unforgivingly buggy, but it's a complete game and almost elegant in it's minimalism.  For me it really scratches that retro, post-apocalyptic late 80's arcade itch.The concept is super simple, you play a guy driving down a broken road in some post apocalypse wasteland heading for some unstated destination.  Along the way there are towns where you can pay for repairs and buy ammo, fuel, guns etc for you and your car.  In between the towns are bad guys you have to avoid or kill for loot.  Entering each town triggers a fight either with some waves of bad guys or one of 5 scripted bosses that you have to beat before you can do your shopping.  The difficulty is in preserving your armor, conserving your ammo and picking up enough cash along the way.  Oh and avoiding canyons.  Those things can be brutal."

On route you will encounter enemy vehicles which can be destroyed with on board weaponry and you shall stop at each village/checkpoint to endure a wave of enemies in order to liberate them so you can purchase your vehicle and personal upgrades there.GameplayThis game is difficult, very difficult, even unbalanced maybe? I'm able to reach the first village without problems but the rest depends on RNGesus and which enemies he spawns. I've had times I barely made it to the next, other times I got killed early on cause I either ran out of fuel or didn't have enough armor to protect my health. In all those scenarios I had around the same amount of cash, just a different upgrade.You could say that you need to find which upgrade is best at which checkpoint and dependent on the amount of cash you have. While this is true, I must admit the gameplay is rather repetitive if you die many times. Therefore finding the commitment/motivation to try a next time decreases drastically with each death on the record.Personal Purchase AdviceI bought the game while on a -40% sale resulting in a price of € 0,59. Even though the full price is € 0,99, which is not that much, my opinion is the following:If you're a person who likes a challenge and who won't give up easily then:Essential|Recommended|Average|Bad|AvoidFor all the others:Essential|Recommended|Average|Bad|Avoid"

There appears to be fundamental game design issues: after the first town, you fight cars for a while that drop fuel, but eventually enemies stopped spawning (along with the critical fuel they drop).I tried six times and suffered two crash to desktops and four rounds where the enemies just stopped showing up for work."

Good enemy variety, heaps of upgrades at fair prices, overall seems to be paced pretty well. Some of the text is badly written, a couple of grammar mistakes but it's clear what is meant. Definitely worth $1."

I don't normally play these kind of games so it could just be my knowledge of these games that makes it not fun for me.It works okay if you have an idea of what you're going to do but because the save mechanic doesn't work (atleast for me) you have to start all over again, and because you die a lot if you're not perfect at this game you have to restart a lot, which can be irritatingI wouldn't recommend this to anyone who doesn't know how to play these kind of games well as they would most likely rage a lot."

When you drive your car into a new settlement, an autopilot will take over.  This means that your car will drive through hazards, damage itself and possibly be destroyed.  It breaks the stupid meter.  It really does.2.  Many of the weapons are kind of useless for the most part.  Shotguns aren't great.  RPGs, while the most expensive weapon in the game, are crap.  You do about 1/4 to 1/2 of the life of a car.  You get 20 shots total.  (I didn't bother to get two).  It's easy to miss with.  There are 5 to 10 cars per trip.  You do the math.3.  When you get to a settlement, you get out of your car.  That's fine.  What sucks is that the car can be damaged while you are fighting outside of it.  I had my car destroyed by a group that had 3 or 4 heavy hitters in it.  Remember that you don't get to pick where your car is parked either...I get that this game is only a buck.  It still sucks."

Spy hunter was a retro car shooter for the Nintendo back in the early 80's; The only thing, that was different with the old Spy Hunter was, you could not get out of your vehical and walk around. Kive adds the effect of being able to walk around your car and shoot bad guys, then get back into your car and use the mounted car weapons.I like this game,  it's pretty cool"
