There is litterally nothing to do. tutorial is not working and.. well I could go on but the bottom line is. this game should never have been in early access in its current state.

However, in it's current state, there is really no incentive to play the game. It is a very pretty game and it is definatley unique, but as someone who is very familiar with these types of games, this is one to stay away from right now. It amazes me that one person made it and for that I give them so much praise, however, as a gamer, I say wait til more is inputed into the game and it becomes more of what we would expect from a game like this. I sincerely hope that this game goes places, it has SO much potential and I can't wait to see it grow. I will continue to play it while hoping that I can watch it grow. Purchase it if you wish, but knowing how most gamers are, I can say that alot will not enjoy it in it's current state. I hope to update this review in the near future."

With that being said, it is different and quite beautiful..but that's all it gets you. It's very buggy, even with just being released. There isn't a big team working on this so I doubt it will have the funding and devolpment to make it an enjoyable game. I wanted to give this a good review and had high hopes for it, I really did..but it fell flat.5/10, mainly due to nicely done abstract graphics."

76561198054414382,Recommended,429020,33393955,Posted: 8 July,all,M¡X,"In the game's current state, I completed this game in under 2 hours. To improve upon this version, please add missions and quests such as ""Kill 30 'Creature things'"" or ""Kill 50 Enemy soldiers"" and once complete the player will be rewarded cash or a weapon. Sidequests seem fitting in this game as it may help increase the game's playtime. There should also be features such as crouch or quick melee as guns are literally the only thing that kills in this game. I've noticed that after shooting a gun for a while it would disappear, I assume the gun has 'broken'. Please add a meter that that will show the gun's conditions. On the topic of breaking guns, I would like to suggest that the player's starting weapon should be unbreakable or breakable but have free restock at base as I broke my starter weapon and had nothing to shoot enemies with and had to scavenge for fallen foes' weapons, that was the only way out of the problem. Since the game is open-world, it would benefit from having vehicles to make travelling around the maps easier. To make the game more atmospheric there should be more ambient noise or sound effects instead of just looping bird chirping. Rustling trees or wind sounds would be nice. Upon traveling to Earth, the landscape was very green (full of vegetation) but very little of buildings, I would suggest you change Earth so that it is more like an Urban area such as a city, take New York for example, an empty ghost-city with abandoned buildings crumbling to the ground and moss and vegetation growing through cracks in roads and buildings would make for a very interesting landscape.So far, the game looks promising and it has the potential to become a great open-world survival game.Please take these suggestions into consideration.4/10"
,Recommended,429020,21156661,"Posted: 12 February, 2016",all,EmberChrysus,"Fun and challenging even in single player. I'm usually not one to play single-player games but this is fun. Sneaking around the AI and evading or countering their surprise attacks is a thrill.Different mining fields provide different ore - some are more valuable than others; but you need to make sure to stay safe when traveling between fields!Very interesting art style that looks even more unique when you get high. For an added bonus, get high then go mine ore to watch the glowing blocks whizz across your screen. ;)The world is indeed very vast. Easy to get lost, but that just adds to the challenge. You can come up with a sort of directional system by taking into account the overhead aircraft and the large skyscraper city. This will help you find other points of interest such as the mining fields, merchants, and aircraft pads.I expect even more excitement once some multiplayer servers start popping up. I will be making my tyrannical kingdom server later on. ;)Some suggestions to dev:A ""safety deposit box"" or bank system to store items (or currency). Perhaps have the merchant charge a fee to maintain the box. To help avoid losing items every time you die, because it is easy to die when starting out. :PMore creatures! The AI military are cool but PvE creature fighting is fun too. Maybe have them near the mine fields? So that if one wishes to mine, they must also take into account the risk of being attacked by a creature.Maybe a map? :PEdit: I uploaded my gameplay as well. It's just over an hour of seamless gameplay of me trying to figure things out, mine, explore, etc. so it's not an edited review of the game or anything like that. There will be some long periods where I realize you can walk across the water to the next island for example, but you also get to see me jump out of my chair every time I start getting shot by enemies heh.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVVwBQfqvkk"

WOW, it's beautiful! i ran across a bug that wont let me spawn at all even if i restart. But to be expected for just being put on early access! Im sure it will be sorted in due time. But I promise you, this game has a lot of promise!"

There seems to be a lack of feedback as to where shots are coming from (but this just might be me being terrible). The UI is straightforward, obvious, the mining is easy, guns are satisfying to shoot. Overall I'm looking forward to what this project brings."

The developer has told me he plans to add a lot of cool stuff and content within the next weeks and months. I urge you to play the game, believe in it and if it gets a lot of people playing single... or multiplayer.. and this game will be successful. theres still some kinks that need working out... but its definitely something to try!"

I started a single player world, and it spawned me on a hill that was barely a hill at all. I could not run up it. I could only slide down.Down right into the ocean. Could not get out.Quit.Joined a multiplayer server...The only one, game freezes up and a loud explosion sounds. I spawn in, and theres a player just running into a wall non-stop. Whilst facing a wall he shoots out of his back and nails me in the face....*refunds game.*"

,Not Recommended,429020,21151292,"Posted: 12 February, 2016",all,CougarBite,"-- Revisit --Combat in the game to be nice is simple. With no real feedback to the weapons, being hit or hitting people. Giving no fun during fights.Game loop is boring, revolves around ""mining"" but no need to explore for resources as they are just next to big shiny towers.No real chance to ""build your own game"" within the online mode, No interactions and just combat no chance of just having a laugh.Game looks pretty in parts, but falls down in others.A.I. doesn't exist, even simple path finding doesn't seem to be there.Variety of weapons are slim...... See video if you need to know more.Recommendation, NoChance of revisit - None, no idea where they are going with the game to make it stand up or what ""fun"" factors the game may containhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkGPEFghFCw-- Original --Games looks really good but not much that can be said after that. But disappointment followed by game breaking bug. If you like optimism followed by disappointment give a watch. Happy to revisit purely for the overall look, but for now give a miss.https://youtu.be/a_xXX3qUVkk"
