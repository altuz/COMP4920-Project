I cant stop playing it!!!1 Maybe a day and night cycle would make it a little more interesting like only certain fish appear at night. and since theres three ability boxes make some of the fish have nighttime abilities.
,Recommended,429050,22770117,"Posted: 2 May, 2016",all,wil4me,"Its multiplayer, its mayhem, its Awesome!Fish overpopulation is simply an understatement, as different fish will either become common or rare according to their movement patterns. I have been in games where the Raptor Fish and Bilbos just decimate the whole ecosystem because of their sheer numbers. Crab Madness certainly made a twist on the game as you took on the role of the lowest hunter in the ecosystem, just to become royalty if you managed to survive what the Ocean Map has to throw at you, including the big shark who hunts whatever it wants whenever it wants.The game is Difficult, but what is there to expect from a Deathmatch/FFA game? The FFA comes into play when you become a larger fish, since the bigger fish don't have as many predators and therefore don't have as much to worry about much like the smaller fish, who are easier pickings for the big fish.The game could use more balances because of how Overpowered the Catfish can be, as a level 5 can eat almost anything without having to tear the fish to pieces."

People are also saying there is nothing to do. They are completely wrong, there are many things to do. There is a ton of different fish to play as and you can even play as crabs. There is multiple different maps. There is a swamp, river and ocean. For me, the crabs are the best because you can be a king crab and build an army to fight another king crab and take his septor. You can't find that anywhere else. You can also be an alcoholic pirate crab with a sword which very fun. The fish come in many different shapes and sizes with different abilities and you need to eat to grow larger (as the name implies) and if you live long enough you might be able to take on the great white shark (I'm yet to kill him). As of controls it is a little tricky to get used to and it is very difficult to catch fish but you will get the hang of it. I definitely recommend you get this game as it is one of my favorite games yet."
,Recommended,429050,34408286,Posted: 21 August,all,Podball,"Before you buy this game you need to ask yourself: Will you enjoy a game where you are a fish?Well if you're weird like me and being a fish sounds appealing to you, then pick up this Early Access gem. It really is fantastic, there is so much content for an Early Access title, and the devs are always updating it and improving the game.-Gameplay-There are a few gameplay modes to choose from (which is great because there is always something new to do in this game)-Deathmatch, in which you eat and grow larger. You can make any fish as huge as you are able to in this game mode, which can lead to some really funny situations! You can even outgrow the map! There are 3 unique maps, each with their own fish, and all fish on each map are playable.-Survival: I LOVE this mode. It's like deathmatch, but in a HUGE ocean map that the devs are constantly updating, adding to and improving. It's really fun to see a new patch and go find the new creatures added to the map. You play as a few select fish and can grow them, survive by feeding (you have hunger in this mode), mate and have babies. It's great fun, each fish feels really different and it's a hoot to try to amass a HUGE swarm of fish and try and take over the map.-Crab madness: You play as a crab. YEP. This is the one mode I don't play as much, the camera's FOV is a little crazy and it makes me motion sick. :( But still... crabs are cool so check it out.-Graphics-The graphics are simple, but colorful and have a ""finding nemo"" feel to them. Which is think is great. I love how the baby fish have cute bug-eyes while the bigger, scarier fish are actually quite terrifying! I haven't had any performance issues with this game- I run it on ""beautiful"" (which I think is like the 2nd best setting). And I have an i5 and Radeon 7500 series GPU (which is pretty old at this point). I have 8gb of RAM.-Sound-There is only ONE music track in this game right now... and to be honest, it's all you need. The music is simple and whimsical, but not overbearing. It's a catchy (but not too catchy) tune that just goes along in the background while you play. The sounds of the creatures themselves are excellent, I love the meat-crunching sounds and the squeaks of the baby fish.-Replayability-I keep coming back to this game in my freetime, and each time I hop back in I always find something new to do. There are SO MANY playable animals in the game and they managed to make each one feel unique. Each fish has it's own abilities, some are passive, others active. They even have stats that grow with you as you level up. This game is surprisingly deep (no pun intended!) in it's gameplay and makes it fun to keep playing again and again.The updates are also great- the devs are really listening to the community and working hard on this game. The thing I love is that the updates are not buggy messes like most Early Access games out there right now. These guys really want their game to be a great game- they're doing it for the love of the game and it shows.I'd recommend this game for people who like play-as-animal games, ocean games, or simply want to try something different and enjoy a fun and addictive single player experience.The devs are working on multiplayer as well! But I haven't tried it, so this review covers singleplayer only at the moment.Thanks for reading!"

,Recommended,429050,22757205,"Posted: 2 May, 2016",all,Disodium,"Your standard Eat and Grow type game,For those not familiar with this genre, you start small and eat other smaller or similar sized creatures to grow, as you grow you start attacking the larger stuff, unless you are hardcore.. then you just try to nom the largest thing you can find and hope you do not get swallowed.It is EA so it has bugs and can be wonky to play sometimes especially when playing a crab(camera gets skewed) but otherwise very enjoyable to play.The models are well animated and the aesthetics are in my opinion nicely done.Simple gameplay W forward, S back, Left click bite, Right click swallow, E to use ability if you have on.Eat other things to grow, grow to win.There is only a few game modes currently but there is mention of more modes to come and maps to play in.Example, currently as of this review there is a Crab Maddness mode where you must raise an army of crabs to destroy the evil crab king but from what I understand this is a time limited event.I have not played Multiplayer, so cannot comment on the games performance there.All in all it is a great little game that is both easy and enjoyable to play.Should you buy it now?Not unless you are a fan of the genre, while it is fun to play, it is very much still in development so add it you your watch list and check back in from time to time."

grow)back.i'll keep this updated as updates go.Let's start with:PROS:-good variety of fishes and maps.-every fish is unique-keeps entertained-few crashes and game-breaking bugs.CONS:-controls are hard to master-some fishes are really op and take over the eco-system pretty quickly.-some fishes lack ""love""LACKS:-mac and linux support-full controller supportSUGGESTIONS:-the snake head is really under-powered compared to its price aka it's overpriced so a buff is needed-reduce diavas in the swamp map,they are everywhere!-nerf the rage ability-buff the eco-radar of the hammer-head-nerf the goliath-nerf the growth of some fishes like the wachuma.-Instead of making separated maps,you could add expansions to already existing maps like coral reef in ocean,kelp in the swamp and a lake in the river-increase the great white's price ,it's really cheap compared to its power.-sharks go cannibal in real life so you should make the hammerhead and the tiger attack each-other-add some spawn points to fishes that lack them.-make predators roam in desolated spawn points like the draith's.-re-add stunning function and first person viewmake herbivores and misc. creatures playable in single player-make that the pufferfih's ability deals damage only if fishes try to attack it instead of doing insta-damage-if survival mode is ever going to be implemented,you should put day/night cycles,hunger bar andmakes you start as a baby level 1 teen level 5 and adult level 10, then the levels restart from 1-skins for every fishAbilities:Ultimate abilities can be like:Can't be harmed by fish smaller than x meters,gains more experience by x ,deals more damage on x etc.replace snakehead's hold with stealth and for active give it ""last resort"" that when used reduces damage received and increases damage dealt based on the user's remaining health and makes it survive out of water-for teotaca:passive ""kill aura"" the more fishes are present in a certain area near the user,this last one will power up itself and for active ""berserk"" when activated it increases user's stats temporarily-active for great white ""stealth attack"" when activated it remains invisible to the prey-active for devour users ""inhale"" that makes swallow a lot of small things near the user's mouth-Give call of the gang to the piranha and the ubur-give to the nilin an active that when activated cures the nilin if bleed is active-give to crustaceans an active ""run away"" that when activated makes the user walk and swim faster-make some herbivores eat coral and add ammonites-give herbivores special abilities to escape or protection-give browurag and bonrex ""juggernaut"" when used the user will charge really fast into a prey,stunning it and deal damage equal to his bite force-give the klej ""deathroll"" when he bites something,if activated he will roll on itself, stunning the prey-give the tiger shark ""blood smell"" works like hammerhead's eco-radar but it has longer range but can detect only wounded fish-give the salmon ""call of the gang""-give the swordfish ""sword attack"" works like the passive,deals damage equal to 2 times his bite force and can be used also when standing still,this can help it in battles when he is wounded and to cut meatFishes OCEAN Napoleon fishes :cost 80 but i don't really have abilities for him,but you can make that he doesn't take damge from fishes smaller than the swordfish's size whale cost 200 abilities inhale and devour,it can't be damaged by fishes smaller than the great white's size black tip reef shark cost 30 abilities rip apart and call of the gang bull shark cost 45 abilities rip apart and juggernaut dolphin cost 30 (reef shark counterpart) abilities ambush and eco-location SWAMP: vampire leech free (i know you made something like that in the halloween update in the ocean but it was unfinished and it got removed instantly) kelp fish cost 45 ability stealth (a passive herbivore) is a dark green fish but his fins are kelp leaves. swamp monster cost 100 a rival to the swamp lurker abilities hold and juggernaut (a big grey fish similar to the goliath) mosasaur (boss)costs same as the great white,abilities ambush and deathroll RIVER storion (i think it's called like this?i'm not english) faster counterpart of the catfish cost 50 ability ambush plesiosaurus (boss) costs the same as the great white and is a tank but is slower abilities snap and ""dash"" that when activated the user dashes and in this case makes his neck longer to catch the preyBUGS-when reaching big sizes, you can clip trough walls and eventually go out of the map or fly to the sky and die.-the catfish tail in the selection menu is bugged-some models in the selection menu don't have animations,maybe you could add some.-if a fish dies during the bite animation,once it's dead his mouth opens abnormally.That's it for now.if the developers read this wall of text is up to them to decide what to do."

The devs threw in a few mini-missions to unlock certain fish n' such and I think that was great and added alot of fun into it. Hopefully once multi-player kicks into gear, it'll get even better. Still has its kinks, but what game still in the works doesn't? Personnaly, I thought the pirate crab was a fun idea."

Personally it would have a lot more replay value if they released a few more maps (size of the ""ocean"") along with 2-3 more fish per map.Another minor downfall is the time between updates seems very spread apart. Also gets slightly repetitive if you plan on playing for extended periods of time."

Simple. Effective. Fun. The controls are difficult at first but after about 10 to 20 minutes of playing you'll have a pretty solid understanding of it.Each fish is some what unique and fun to play, the maps are nice and the environment is damned pretty.Oh and if it runs kinda badly, turn off Motion Blur and Universal lighting, for me it went from 30 to 60 fps which is nice.9/10 - Its a good casual game and the only improvement I can suggest is more creatures, more abilities, more maps!"

I realize its only 2 or 3 guys but im just saying it would be really cool. and some more fish suggestions like mudskippers, stingrays, whales, mosasaur, great white playableand some more prehistoric sea creatures. or even an aquarium mode where you play as small fish in an aquarium. sorry, i have so many ideas but yes its a very good game and cant wait for more cool updates and releases. im a fish inthusiest and really love fish so i just thought id share some of the many other ideas that i have."

NoWhy?  $15.00 is too much for what you get currently.The more you know- I'm giving this a thumbs up becuase I did like it, and once it's done It should be worth $15.00.However, I returned it. Why you ask? I was keeping track of the time I played it (just in case). After almost 2 hrs, I had played on all maps, and played the fish I wanted to play. I looked into the muliplayer mode, but there were only 3 servers and no one on any of them. I also don't think the current game mode would be fun in multiplayer, because of how easy it is to camp spawns.I also would like to point out, that the fish have the same abilities on every map. So if  you think about it, each map have different fish, but really the only difference is the skin of the fish. Which was dissapointing to me. Maybe this will be changed in the futre. The one exeption to this, is the turtle on the swamp map. The only ""new"" ability was hiding in the shell. At the same time though, it was the only turtle. I'm sure if they add more, the will just look different and have the same abilities and stats."

Different possibilities for this game. I have plenty of my own ideas.With a concept so unique and interesting like this I gladly support the devs with my contribution. Can't you see it now? In a huge lake with hundreds of fish and you're competing against real people to become a predator that people run from... Er.. Swim from. I've played 8 or so hours and I've had a blast. While there isn't much to do yet, I can't help myself from looking up things about this game and thinking about the possibilities. This game is very fun. The mechanics are pretty smooth and the graphics are very pleasing. The fish are colorful and unique. It's fun playing as different fish and seeing their unique abilities. I like the leveling system even at its core basic. Just seeing your fish grow into a huge lunker is an amazing feeling.Buy this game if you like the idea and concept.

Wasn't sure what I'd think or how long it'd hold my attention. Low and behold I have almost 3 hours of gameplay already lol.It runs surprisingly well, despite having so much going on at any given time and doesn't lag my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little laptop to crap.The only complaint I have is that the clicking seems to be a bit buggy (which might just be my mouse) but there seems to be a delay between the times you can actually click. Which sucks when you're trying to rapid bite when you're being swarmed by enemies and you bite really slowly OR not at all.The other complaint I have is that it wipes your coins every time you quit, so you *have* to start over. I collected over 200 coins when I first played and when I logged back in they were gone and I was kinda mad lol.Other than that, this is a fun little time waster and I can't wait for it to be multiplayer lol."

The catfish is the main problem, it needs a little better AI for the river map, as it sits under a rock pretty much the whole game refuses to leave. Then when i get a big enough pike or something else to farm the catfish, it gets knocked out of the water and doesn't respawn. One possibility to fish this is to create a timer where entities that have been out of water for over 1 minute die so they can respawn. Apart from that a great addicting game. Loving getting a lvl 40+ pike and just sucking everything up. Cannibalism is also possible if you're big enough to swallow the fish whole"

The game still feels limited parhaps that will be better when you can play on a server. not sure what they could add to expand the gameplay from what it is becides dailys events. I think breeding could be a thing perhaps eggs are saved unlike coins and you could get bonus powers just a thought. that game is fun interesting to play and can be very hard.

I wouldn't mind the fact that they're easily killed by both packs of cheap fish (especially once they level up) and expensive fish, if they had funner or more useful abilities.Your better off just leveling up a starter fish and hanging out in a pack of fellow starter fish npcs (that will also level up, especially if you help them hunt) until you earn enough to by the more expensive fish.I also wouldn't mind harder modes were more challenging (perhaps hard mode could use a hunger system?)"

This makes the game much more fun, as you'll probably try to break your size or level record with the different fishies.I'll give the game a 7/10, it needs some more maps and polishing, as well as more game mechanics for the different fishies."

Like the 2D Feeding Frenzy of old, but in 3D.Swim around, hunting smaller creatures and avoiding larger ones.  A key difference to Feeding Frenzy is that you need to attack the enemy first and then eat up their remains.Camera works well, and very few problems seeing where you are.  The key confusing times I had was when playing a crab and getting flipped upside down in combat.At the moment getting extra levels automatically upgrades your health and attack - but hopefully as the game develops you will get the option on what to spend your upgrade points on."

I really didn't know what to expect when I picked up this title, other than the whispers I'd heard from some of my buddies regarding the game's recent popularity on YouTube. I've been looking for a game I can build a new series around, so I decided to pick it up and give it a shot. Now, at this moment, I haven't spent a great deal of time with FAGF, so this review is more of a first impressions than anything else so please, don't take it as gospel, as there is still a lot about the game that I don't know.With that out of the way, FAGF is essentially an educational game that teaches people about the food chain. The objective is basically to eat anything and everything smaller than you (and sometimes bigger) until you level up and grow, at which point you can then start eating bigger and more nutritious sea creatures! The possibilities are endless! By eating other fish, you level up and gain coins, which are then used to temporarily unlock other fish. Depending on the fish you choose, you have different abilities and attributes that either make the game easier or harder. Think Twisted Metal, but with fish.There are also a three different maps that you can play in, though I have only tried the river and the ocean. The ocean was a very narrow, straight forward map that gave nowhere near as much flexibility as the ocean. The ocean was ENORMOUS, and there were plenty more fish and plants around to help you level up, though the number of hostile high level browerags, tiger sharks and eels is borderline insane. Good luck surviving more than a few minutes! I know I couldn't.All in all, FAGF is a fun, beautiful looking and mechanically simple game, though the game itself can be quite challenging and I'm starting to understand why it's recently gained the popularity that it has. I believe there is a free version that you can get on Gamejolt, but it doesn't have the multiplayer capabilities that the Steam version has, so if you're into MP and want to support the devs (which are two young brothers), then this is the way to go.Hope you enjoy Feed and Grow: Fish as much as I have been!Cheers dudes!"

There's 0% chance you'll ever get to eat anything, especially in the river map. This is due to the fact that if you swim with your species, they'll literally eat everything you kill. If you swim away, they will follow. But if you get attacked, you're on your own. Finally save up for a new species? Great job! Too bad you die in the next 5 seconds because a bigger fish was lurking near your spawn. What's that? You need to save up again for the next half an hour? Fun."

,Recommended,429050,31516649,Posted: 2 May,all,アマツキツネ,"Best. Game. EVER. This game reminds me of Feeding Frenzy. For those who don't know, Feeding Frenzy was a 2 dimensional game where you ate fish to become bigger, then you would eventually become a different bigger fish later on (similar to this game). This game is just the 3 dimensional version of that (which I love)!!! This game has stayed entertaining every time I have played it! It is a great relaxing game to play, as well as how it can be very challenging (especially in crab madness)... Can't wait for further updates! This game is worth every penny!!!! Don't hesitate! Get it! Get it now!!!!!!"

As it stands now its a nice time waster but once or if the devs get servers set up I feel like it will be a more complete game.

,Recommended,429050,34046656,Posted: 5 August,all,Shawkdab12,awsome. this game is in early access for a reason. lots of stuff needs polished but IS SO FUN!. Multi player dosnt always work but the devs are working on it. But when you and a freind get it to work you have so much fun! We both became clownfish and i got HUGE and could eat anything and i ate my freind a couple times... This game has a great future and updates arre worth waiting for.. also amazing graphics . once they fix multiplayer it would be a perfect game

I enjoy the open world, combined with the classic game of eating fish to get bigger so you can eat bigger fish. Something to remember atm is that its early axcess.  If you are looking to play this multiplayer currently you have to host your own server and people are just not doing  that, but if you are looking for a chill game to ""wind down"" and play this is your game."

I'd say this is the game equivalent to drugs... which i hav'nt tried.Its just this game is so god dang addicting, it would be impossible for someone no to want to ge this game. I mean sure it has its fair share of bugs and glitches. But thats what to expect in an early access game. One suggestion i do have though is that, since the alpha version was really intriguing and i didint get to try it. Please game developer, try to add in a gamemode that had a resembelence to the alpha stages, fixing the bugs of course. But what i mean, is that you should have a game mode where fish can get really big, and the lvling up system is constant. So you can speed up growth and and level, like it was in the alpha. This is my review, thank you"

IMHO its fun to play,but does have its bad ideals.The good.Its fun to play, and is a challenge to play. The developers have put some good though into the game and seem to be working hard on it.The bad.There is NO SAVE option in the game unless you play survival mode. This is a big need to be done option. Its pointless to play for long periods of time, then have to leave the game for what ever reason (school,work dinner) and loose everthing that you have played gone because of no save option.In closeing, the game is fun and I have not had to many bugs yet. I have played the game on 2 diffrent PCs. One is a higher end PC the other lower end. The high end PC plays it very well (i7-4790k@4.4,8GB ram,gtx970,windows10). The lower end PC did struggle (amd4core@2.8,8GBram,amd5450,windows7)."

Kinda like feeding frenzy in 3D but without the progression part or the Levels. You just play a bunch of different fish with different modes I really can't wait to see the future of this game. It has alot of potential."
