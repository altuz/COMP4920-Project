I make a priority to get couch games for when we're together, I have to say that this is one of our new favorites.The kids couldn't get enough of it(My played time is off, we put way more hours into it over the weekend). Usually I get to a point where its time to move on to the next local game for us to play.. I didn't with this one.The mechanics of the game feel well balanced, I love all of the strategies you can implement to knock out your opponents. The dodge/catch mechanic works extremely well, there wasn't a time where I felt I was cheated. If I got hit, it was my own fault.The game has a story mode that can be played with another player, and has unlockable characters. There are a few levels, but each of them feel fresh with the different themes and obstacles to avoid. I'd love more of them, but for now I'm content with whats there. Customizeable rules help to keep things interesting as well.All in all I feel its a great game, especially at its price point. I know this will be the first game played on the next weekend we have together, and likely many more to come."

It feels like I'm back to the times where you used to play video games with your friends in actual real life! I was playing with a friend and we laughed so much that we needed a break half way through, you get really admitted to the game and it's like it's only getting more fun the longer you play because you get better and the competition gets more exciting!I want to congratulate Game Swing because of this game, it has really brought tears to my eyes and I honestly can't wait to have my friend over again tonight to play it :)"
,Recommended,429330,32732623,Posted: 24 June,all,RazorNova,"Very good and funny game as a local co-op. Has received some new content after release, which is always nice. Gameplay is easy to learn but gets pretty challenging on higher difficulties. Might be a bit short on content as a single player experience, but this game is clearly intended to be played with several players, and is most fun with 4 players due to most game modes having been designed to work with group of 4. Excellent party game with humor."

There is multiplayer if you and a friend have it, but no online vs mode. I have yet to finish the story mode but I am am pleased with it so far. Would recommend 10/10 ign."

Beautiful, compelling and FUN!"

,Recommended,429330,22275378,"Posted: 6 April, 2016",all,de_traxx,By far one of the most awesome local multiplayer I ever played. I waited for this game for about 1.5 years after playing it at a conference in Denmark.Played it with some not-really-gamer friends and they got as excited and worked up as I did. It is super competetive and fun - especially once you master it.Totally recommended if you're into local multiplayer!
,Recommended,429330,29080199,Posted: 6 January,all,Judicial Branch,"I have been on a spree to buy local co-op games because friends come over quite often and this happened to be one of them. Needless to say it was an amazing purchase. I bought it for the retail price.Right when you hop into a quick match it's just super fun, you dive, dodge, and catch balls that are thrown at you, while also attempting to get the opponents out. My friends and I did free-for-all and team play and both were just as good as the last.Pros-Team Play/Free-For-All-Story mode-Quick match-Unlockable characters-Custom gameplay options-Fun interactables in game-Death is just as fun as living because you can use different attacks to get the current opponents out.-Fun maps-Simple controls-Good designCons-Could have more maps and game modesOverall this game is a wonderful purchase, nice developers and gameplay. Purchase this game if you want a fun local co-op game to play with friends. 11/10"

,Recommended,429330,22181805,"Posted: 1 April, 2016",all,Chombie,"I first played this game with my friends at EGX Birmingham in 2015. Myself and my friends loved this game. It was our favourite game of the whole event. The humour, the retro look, the sounds and the gameplay were fantastic and made us all so happy. I would recomend this game. The game does need an Online Multiplayer though! Playing against bits gets old fast, and you cant really have many people playing from the same PC at the same time, 2 max really. Please add an Online multiplayer, i would like to have the same hilarious times i had playing this game with my friends like we did at EGX. I really feel this game will take off should that be added."

,Recommended,429330,22195094,"Posted: 2 April, 2016",all,The Tallest Hobbit,"Local multiplayer is something that I'm grateful still exists. Towerfall, Gangbeasts and now Stikbold! all fall into the ""have a couple of beers with your friends, laugh and get your a$$ kicked""-category of games, which I love.Stikbold!, since it's a dodgeball game, works best when played free-for-all with 3-4 people in my opinion. Everyone can play this game (""pick up the ball and shoot"" isn't too hard to do), which is why I'd recommend it to families as well as friend groups. If you're a skilled gamer there are tips and tricks for you to use as well - curve balls, dodges and such.The story mode actually surprised me, in a good way, though. It's a fun story, but should be played co-op (""no one's a team alone"") if you want to unlock all achievements and get the most out of it, since the bot's a bit clueless at times and prefers to leave things up to you.Lastly, it's definitely best to play this game with controllers! The keyboard's alright, but a controller is really the way to go."

I connected 4 controllers and my TV to my PC for a party and it was easily the best $10.00 I've ever spent in my life.The steam pics don't do this game enough justice.  I had very low hopes for this game, and grabbed it on a whim, but you have to trust me on this -- it's hysterical.  The music, the gameplay, all the little sneak moves you can do, the wierd 70's porn vibe the game has ... just trust me.If you're having a co-op party, BUY THIS GAME.  You're welcome."
