The winning quotes are very nice, one of them going as far as saying ""git gud"". The maps are all nicely varied, going from basic to making you want to jump off a skyscraper into a pool full of piranhas.As for the bad things, the hitboxes are ridiculous and the game tells you to make a review/join the discord like it's a goddamn google play app.In the end, buy it if you have friends. It's kind of boring alone and there's not many players, which makes me feel like the developers should've advertised their game more."

I had a blast raging at this game that I hate to love. You will enjoy all the time you spend playing this, till you eventually spike a controller through a wall.98/100 The_DragonKingGamer ""I hate my life now, but at least the journey to depression was fun.""Seriously though I do love this game, and I recommend it to all player, pro and casual. You'll have a blast and it's great with friends. Developers are responsive and content is unique and enjoyable. The maps detail and sillyness make it a game I can play everyday. Thanks for this gem, have a good one!    ^^"

Absolutely worth the purchase!"

,Recommended,429360,34358287,Posted: 19 August,all,Sjofel Wolf,"This game on itself is really well executed, it takes party/couch games to a more competitive play.the style and colors look really good.Pros:- Simple controls- Fun gameplay- Not too difficult to become good at- Great music- Character animations look great- Short loading time- arenas each provide a different challangeCons:- Servers are sometimes a little laggy.- At the moment it kinda lacks in players, so it might take some time before you can play- Single player is a little dull sometimes.The game in my opinion is worth the 10 euro, I have a ton of fun just running across a field where fireballs fly all around,also those loading screen splashes are sometimes quite entertaining to see.Although this game is not for everyone, you need a bit of patience to get a little good at the game.You also need to be able to think quick, or respond to something within seconds.there is no voice chat or regular chat wich I quite enjoy so you can't experience anny salt. Unless you play with friendsThis game also is also more enjoyed with friends, so if you have them: convince them to also get this game. It is worth all the money that you'll pay for it.so for my final rating I would say it gets a solid 8/10.Summary:- fun and simple gameplay- worth buying- lacks in players at the moment (I will edit this when the game gets more players)"

,Recommended,429360,34353905,Posted: 19 August,all,Arcanon,"DISCLAIMER: I was a beta tester for the game prior to release, and am a ""Valued Tester"" in the Discord server. I was provided with a beta key during that period, but I purchased the game post-release and have been given no incentive or consideration to write this review.TL;DR: The game is fun. Buy it.When I describe Lupinball to people, I say ""It's sorta like Duck Game, but with wolves and fireballs instead of ducks and weapons."" It gives you a bit of an idea what to expect.Lupinball is a primarily 2-4 player game (with a single player mode) where each player controls a different bipedal wolf. These wolves collect energy icons that pop up on the field. Up to 3 can be held at once. When one is picked up, the wolf can deploy a shield for a short time, with the shield lasting longer with more spheres. With three, the wolf can deploy a magic fireball. The object of the game is to survive by dodging opposing fireballs while launching yours to hit your opponents. There are also items that pop up from time to time to twist gameplay a bit, like orb blockers (prevent opponents from using shields/fireballs) and one that flips the stage upside-down but leaves controls intact.This is where the Duck Game comparison comes in. One hit, and you're dead. Once all but one wolf are dead, the stage shifts to the next and the match continues until one player wins enough rounds to win the game. There's a bit less humor in the death scenes compared to Duck Game, but the overall game is very light-hearted, with hilarious loading screen messages relating ""fun facts"" about wolves, and the characters are very charming. (Bart is best sheep.) Plus, ALL THE WOLF PUNS.Unlike Duck Game, there are no platforms or jumping. Levels aren't completely random either; each player selects a stage, and the selected stages are played in a random order. When they are complete, players then select additonal stages, and the game continues until a winner is decided. I like this freedom of choice, but I would love to see an ""uninterrupted random mode"" implemented as an option in the future.The game handles really well. Movement is smooth (except on stages with elements like wind and ice where impeded movement is the point) and you can even adjust the trajectory of the fireballs for a split second after initiating launch. Each map is unique, and offers its own obstacles, be it slowed down movement (Gailes, Wolphone, Pawcific Ocean) or changing elements like shifting walls and temporary darkness (Wolffer, Moon Estate), to name only a few examples. Gameplay itself is extremely simple; with only movement, shield and fireball launch as your only controls, your mastery of the game will rely on experience more than learning any complicated combos or controls.You can customize the match options (points to win, friendly fireballs, item appearance, among others) to create the match setting that suits you and your friends best. There are even accessibility options, such as a reduced flash mode and a color-blind mode. And of course, there is online play.Single player mode flips the rules a bit. You're alone on a map, and you're firing constant fireballs to fill the stage up. You have 30 seconds (extended with each fireball you launch) to keep firing. One hit from one of your own fireballs, and you're out. Once time is up or you die, you are taken to the next stage, repeated until you've played all of the maps in a row. Your score is the amount of fireballs you launched in every stage, totaled up, and there is a global leaderboard for the best score. It's pretty fun, though I would like to see an AI single player mode implemented where you do battle against 1-3 computer opponents.Dev support is top-notch. The Discord server is active and the community, while young, is already very friendly. Devs hang out there and are dedicated to improving this game and making it a fun experience.All in all, for 10 bucks (I paid 9 with launch discount), it's a pretty solid game. I think it could earn its place among the many other popular couch multiplayers."
,Recommended,429360,34318245,Posted: 17 August,all,[NW] RadSquirrel,"Lupinball is a 4 player arena game that plays more like a bullet hell then anything else. The art is a well crafted pixel based styled, with 15 unique levels, an awesome soundtrack, leaderboards and some extra silly quotes about wolves to boot! With a low base pricepoint, there isn't anything this game missed its mark on."

You can have up to 4 people in a room, and damn does it get hectic. The levels each have unique occurences, and the mechanics are just so much fun. Totally worth the 9.99 I paid for it"

Well, until you realize just how late it's gotten!! :)  It *will* happen.Getting into online multiplayer matches couldn't be much simpler, but don't underestimate the importance of the single player mode for getting your footwork and, perhaps more importantly, stage-handling skills improved!"
76561198067507623,Recommended,429360,34472002,Posted: 24 August,all,MuscularBunny,"So far, I am absolutely loving this game. I'm really looking forward to seeing if they'll add anything to the mechanics and if they'll add anymore arenas. However, even if they didn't I would still recommend this game. The only con I can say about it is that the single player mode gets a bit boring, so if you don't have a strong enough internet connection to play online multiplayer, or if you can't do local multiplayer, then it might get a little repetitive for you. Even still, this game is an easy 9/10."

76561198025585279,Recommended,429360,34388717,Posted: 20 August,all,MrWolf,"This is one of the best party games I’ve played - not since Mario Kart on the N64 have i had so many “not competitive” friends exclaim as their character slowly drifts lifeless off the screen, or a moving floor tile takes them splat in to the path of an oncoming fireball. The music is catchy, and I find myself humming it, or thinking other people are humming it in the office - not yet, but soon I hope!Was supposed to play this for a few mins before JackBox Party, but this turned in to the whole evening. Thanks to the time stop mechanic when a player dies, its as fun to watch as it is to play.Well worth it, and recommended!!"
