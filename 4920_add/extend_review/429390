,Not Recommended,429390,22178148,"Posted: 1 April, 2016",all,Smokey,"Edit: Played a couple of 3 player games on the recent April 12th patch. It's still a fun core game, but the glitches and game issues make it too frustrating. This game is hard, and requires every resource to be used effectively. If you can't use something because of a game glitch, it pretty much kills the enjoyment.So the game itself is great. I'm a veteran of tabletop and electronic card games of a similar nature, although I never played the tabletop version of Xenoshyft. The mechanics were easy to understand and pick up, and the card selection and balance seemed fine.The reason I'm currently not recommending this game is due to the myriad game breaking bugs that we found in only about 4 hours of gameplay. After a patch or update, I will gladly re-review this game.We had the following happen:* Milita couldn't be played to an empty space on the board. When I discarded him at the end of the round, it also discarded a surviving stormtrooper. This can be a pretty huge swing in a game like this. Our assumption is that some sort of internal ""card ID"" got mixed up, and the game though the stormtrooper and the militia were the same card.* To go along with the game getting confused, playing with one of the expansion powers (Grafting Lab), the tier 2 ability lets you bring back a card from the discard pile into your hand. It was a crapshoot what would happen when I would use the ability. Sometimes I would get 1 card, sometimes I would get all of the cards, and at least 2 or 3 times my TEAMMATE got the cards. This did not adversely effect the game since he could play on my cards, but bizarre nonetheless* We had tons of bizarre issues playing cards on other people's lanes. On death effects like the vindicator armor weren't usable if they were played on another lane. We also had troops discarded at the end of combat we had placed in another player's lane for no discenible reason.* The biggest, and gamebreaking-est of them all happened to us twice. We were in the 7th or 8th wave, and while we had both clicked done on a reveal phase (2 green check marks), the game wouldn't advance us to to the draw phase. We tried several things to 'jump start it', like both unchecking, one person leaving the game. It just wouldn't go forward. Very very frustrating after spending 30 minutes working towards the finale.The UI is serviceable, but could use some help* Why is your resource (Xenostathem) not indicated with the icon instead of the text. Pretty minor, but they have pretty icons for everything, I had to literally ask my buddy in the first game where on the screen my total resources were.* Should give you a checkbox for 'auto pass' if you don't have anything else you can do in a turn, or if you and your teammates know you won't have much impact on their lane.* I was constantly double clicking when I should be single clicking to use abilities, and it could be confusing what state you were in. The text seemed to blend into the background a lot. I wouldn't mind some more highlighting around the 'Done' button, or other text that tells you you need to do something before you continue."

Overall, it's a good SINGLE PLAYER game, just like the 1.0 board game.  Hard as nails, almost impossible to win.I'm giving it a negative because:1.  No one is EVER online. EVER.  If you want a game, gonna have to convince some friends to join.2. This game needs to be updated to the 2.0 rules, which softens the starting difficulty curve.3.  Absolutely needs the Dreadmire expansion. Never coming.4. The game is abandoned by the developer team. Updates and fixes were promised, never amounted to anything.Change those, and I'd be happy to return playing and mark this positive.  But it won't happen."
,Not Recommended,429390,22748194,"Posted: 1 May, 2016",all,Justin Hopewell,"I love that so many board/card games are being given digital versions these days, but this is the kind of release that mars the trend.To address my low playtime, my issues with this game are not related to the actual game mechanics of XenoShyft, but rather the technical and design choices made for this digital version.First off, there isn't even an exit button on the main menu (that I could see), so you have to ALT+F4 to exit if you're playing in fullscreen.The options menu contains no video settings whatsoever, leaving you with no resolution settings. The only thing you can change is whether you want to play in windowed mode or fullscreen, selectable only before you start the game in what appears to be the default Unity popup, Playing in fullscreen results in a square shaped view area with nothing using the left and right sides of your monitor. UI that could be placed in this area is instead crammed in the top and bottom of the screen, which means you have to pan around constantly, even when zoomed out.Speaking of zooming, it's incredibly slow and requires several full mousewheel turns to get close to the cards. I thought adjusting the zoom sensitivity setting in the options would alleviate this, but it barely made a difference. I have a Logitech mouse with a free-spinning toggle on the wheel that's useful when you're reading documents with many pages. Scrolling up 40 pages or so this way takes a few seconds. It takes about the same amount of time just to zoom in this way in XenoShyft.When you want to pan, you have to click an area outside of the playing field and drag the view (the way you would do it on a touchscreen with your finger). If you click on some cards this way, it will instead show you a zoomed in view of the card. But it won't do this on some other cards (like generic Militia cards).I could have dealt with all of that, annoying as it is, but the real dealbreaker is that sometimes pieces of the UI do not respond, breaking the game by not allowing you to advance to the next phase of the game.The game was clearly ported from a mobile version and it shows all over the product from the nonexistent resolution options, to the unresponsive and cluttered UI, to the awkward panning and zooming controls.The tutorial does a good job at teaching you the rules of the game, but is done through a slow and annoying ""AI"" voice that reads to you and cannot be disabled. At least I know how to play if I decide to purchase the physical card game.It's a shame because the underlying game seems fun. As it currently stands, I can't recommend it until the developers fix a lot of these issues, which really seems like they'd have to redo a large part of the game."

,Recommended,429390,25657655,"Posted: 23 September, 2016",all,hitt.william,"I really enjoyed this title. It was originally a board game, and is about defending your base from attacks by alien creatures. Each game consists of nine waves, in which you can drop up to four soldiers to reveal and fight four aliens, one by one. Hopefully, you've chosen the right soldiers to defend your base, and equipped them in a way that plays to their strengths. Additionally, there are ""instant"" cards that can be played in the middle of the wave to bolster your soldiers in the heat of the moment. The game can be played cooperatively with one of many factions, each of which specialize in a particular field. The weapons division can gets it's hands on weapons cheaper and eventually deal more damage, where the armor division can grab armor cheaper and eventually get more defense out of it. I enjoyed trying to win with each faction, and feel that both the NorTec Elite and Hive expansions added a great amount of replayability to the game.  The tense feeling as each card is flipped is very memorable, and good planning is usually rewarded."

At the end of round 7 there were 2 enemies left but the game kept on spawning enemy cards and dealing damage to the base till it was destroyed.The only way I have been able to make progress is by using the science lab and loads of grenades. Every card and ability counts. I am playing on easy with 20 hitpoints for the base. I would not consider this easy.I do enjoy the intensity and the close combat of this game even though the odds are heavily stacked against the player.
76561198053232801,Not Recommended,429390,32773082,Posted: 25 June,all,Random,"I wanted to like this game, but I did not.The interface is very clunky.  And the balance is tight enough that mis-clicks or mis-applied abilities can ruin a game.  The multiplayer is empty.  The 9 rounds it takes to play through to a victory ends up feeling like a real slog.  And you will have to hit a ""Done"" button like 20-30 times a turn.  It is ridiculous.As near as I can tell the game is easier the more divisions (players) you have... and when playing single player you can control up to 4 players.  So, set yourself up with multiple divisions, then really overpower around two lanes in the early game by using all the cards from all the players on just those two lanes.... and leave the other lanes utterly empty.  Your base will take damage in that first round, but you can take it.Once you have built up your super lanes, then on round 2 you can overload your remaining lanes, and then you just sort of coast through the rest of the game.It is annoying to play as 4 players solo, however, because each player has it's own hand of cards with interrupts and abilities.... and you will need to either remember what everyone has or cycle through them all every time something important happens.So, then the game has a simple strategy that makes it not very hard.  You are repeating the same strategy solo.  The interface makes playing this strategy clunky.  You can't play with other people cause there aren't other people playing this.  And then you have to wonder, is this even fun?Simple but grindy.... was not fun for me.  Sadly I can't recommend."

,Recommended,429390,33399917,Posted: 9 July,all,Munkhi,"Unforgiving, but every win feels like it was earned. Newbies will find it very difficult until they start to understand the various synergies on offer with division, troops, abilities and when to pop them.It'd be nice if it was cross platform with the mobile app versions too.Interface is a bit clunky, but it feels like the desire was to stop misclicks. Take a little time over what you are doing.This is a direct translation of the board game. I have to say it's nice to play this without the long set up times! Artwork is excellent on the closeups, if macabre. This also has the advantage of making sure newbies aren't accidentally breaking any of the game rules, or may expose them to actions and play orders they never realised playing the board game version. I personally thought the rule ""book"" that came with the physical board game was cr@p, leaving us shrugging several times and just going with whatever we *thought* they meant. The PC/mobile app versions will set you straight.All in all,  if you'd like a tricky deck builder that requires a bit of brain matter, then you could do a lot worse than grab this. Stay away if you have no attention span and/or expect the game to treat you like a special snowflake and let you win everytime."

In that same round I had a vindicator armor that I could not use after a trooper died.

You get all the expansions with the base game for 10-15$ compare to 80-100$ for  the physical copy. Great if you were thinking to buy this just for solo. The game has some nice effects and seems to be well polished. The only gripe I have is that it sometimes does not let you end the turn thus you are stuck. Overall great game.

,Recommended,429390,22153064,"Posted: 30 March, 2016",all,Kitty Rampage,"XenoShyft is a PC port of a mobile port of a physical deckbuilding game called XenoShyft: Onslaught. The deckbuilding game itself was the result of a successful Kickstarter, raising a touch over $242,000.The deckbuilder is a tough as nails cooperative romp that has been overall well received, currently holding a rating of 7.21 on BGG. All of that being said I do feel this is a game better played in it's physical form. There's just something about the drawing of cards and having friends around that can't be beat by a digital game. Though that's true of all board games I suppose. It is a pretty solid port, a few odd card interaction mechanics aside. Hence I'd have to recommend it if you're interested in the game. This is a far less expensive way to get it anyway as the board game costs 5x as much for just the base game without expansions."

While I applaud the attempt to fix the issue, The new time bar for progressing the game can some times freeze, which unfortunately causes the game to not progress.We've made sure that everyone had a ready status in our group, but no dice. So in the end, it still comes down to the game freezing on us when we play. I give props for the developers at least trying, and I can't wait to see a fix that works! It's only happened twice so far. So we managed to actually finish our games for once. Had a great time too!"
