A narrative game built on an RPG engine with no combat, no branching, and simple puzzles.I'm still recommending it. Accepting that it's short and linear, the writing was uncommonly decent. I've played a lot of big-budget games with incomprehensible stories and inane dialogue. Even though this was a very straightforward science fiction story, it was well done in comparison."
,Recommended,429470,20953172,"Posted: 4 February, 2016",all,Vic=HKC=,"Gail Pilgrim is a ship pilot, transporting passengers in space. This time, she has three persons: a retired colonel, a clever scientist and a crazy Russian priest that is reciting passages from the Bible. However, nearing the end of the journey, someone took the commands of the ship... How will Gail regain the control and save her passengers? And why people at Innes Station where she's docking because of an emergency are behaving weirdly too?This little adventure game was made with RPG Maker, true, so, the style and the HUD is known. But the story is well-written: you go from twist to twist, you're playing two characters actually (Gail then someone else in act III) and you have some good humor in it (Gail is maybe a good girl but she's not really confident in herself).The gameplay is easy: you search for items, you discuss with people and nope, you don't have any hidden object scenes - because usually that kind of beginning for the sentence is often found in my review about HOG. Anyway, you can combine items in your inventory when needed. Keep in mind that sometimes, you need to go to the inventory and examine more closely items in order to advance in the game - I was kinda stuck twice because I didn't think about this action.The soundtrack is also a good one. I loved the fact that you can activate the intercom to play music and to enable finally something to listen instead of the void.Seriously, for the price, you have a little good moment to enjoy. True, it's short - you can complete the game in 1 hour. However, I'm looking forward to the other episodes (I've the second one in my library and at the time of the writing, the third one is in my wishlist). Go ahead!"

,Recommended,429470,21066306,"Posted: 8 February, 2016",all,[slckr]robilar5500,"Well, I played this game today on a whim and actually quite enjoyed it. Mark this one down as one of the good RPG Maker titles on Steam. The story was cool. Sort of reminiscent of a 1950's sci-fi mystery. It's pretty standard point and click, combine items or sequences to solve puzzles fare. Nothing too challenging at all, but that's actually good as it doesn't step on the game by making the puzzles too complicated. This is meant to be a more casual and enjoyable introduction to the series from what I can tell and it succeeds.As far as all video games go, I'd probably rate this as a 6 out of 10, but when taking account it being an RPG Maker title, I give it a boost to about 7.5 out of 10. Plus, it is (at the time of this writing) 49 cents on Steam, and there is a good chance that you already have this in your library, but if not, I would recommend giving it your attention."

It's short, and fun.  There's no staggering plot twist, and the characters are likewise light on the plot.  The game feels like a one-off episode in a series... which it is.  There are three more episodes after this one.Personally, I enjoyed myself.  This was a good way to kill time when I didn't have time to sit and play longer, more involved games.  Be aware that you won't get more than a couple of hours of entertainment from this.  Once you beat it, there's no real reason to go back and replay it.As a final note, you shouldn't be paying more than about $0.50 for this game, as it goes on frequent heavy sales.  I suspect that the maker simply cycles through a sale on each episode, but either way, don't pay full price when you don't have to.  I got all four episodes for $2.00 total.Bottom Line:Recommended"

For a game that is made in RPG maker it's pretty awesome, story is good, very emotional in the last chapter. Puzzles are nice and not to challenging.All in all, very good game for its price. Total amount of hours needed to pass all chapters is around 8-10 hours, which is same as let's say Bishock Infinite or Call of Duty games, so the game shouldn't be judged by its low playtime."

It's really a good way to spend some time. It REALLY requires music though...

I don't want that to get lost when I don't recommend the game.The premise was interesting and on sale for $0.50, how could I not check it out? Based on how things start, I was ready for a good little horror game. It'd be like Alien; stuck on a ship with an unknown threat. The developer is great at setting up atmosphere. The music was perfect and the characters set a good tone. Thumbs up on having me turn down the lights. Unfortunately, there was no real payoff and it ended very anticlimactically. The gameplay is very simple as you just do one task after the other. It's just a matter of finding the right thing to interact with. The characters are not that interesting. One is crazy, one is nice, and the other one is ""Jerk Spock"". Two of them do have a little philosophical argument that was interesting, but it never goes anywhere, unfortunately.The second act is very similar in that you can tell something strange is going on and you're waiting for the other shoe to drop. Again, the ultimate ""reveal"" isn't very interesting. The third act actually has two interesting characters, but again it's their interaction with each other that is the best part, so you really have nothing to do with that and are just an observer.Ultimately, there isn't enough here to be worth your time or money, but the developer does show some talent that can be built on for future projects.Edit: Also, my play time is not reflective of game length. I had it running in the background while I did other things. It's very short."

While playing with your mouse you see if it's possible to interact with something. You can also use your keyboard/controller which makes it feel more like a typical RPG Maker game.Every character has it's own selfmade picture (some are rather creepy).

Aboard the spaceship Quicksilver, it seems like another routine trip to another planet, but things quickly go awry when the vessel becomes hijacked by an unknown source. The game is split up into three chapters, and a short prologue, and in total the game will last you about an hour.aptain Gail Pilgrim has been flying starships since she was a kid, ferrying passengers between planets and space stations across the galaxy. She has no reason to expect that this latest trip to Alpha Centauri will be anything special, even if her passengers are a little more diverse than usual.Release Date: 14 Dec, 2015Despite being both short and the first title of the series, Alpha Centauri does a wonderful job of holding the attention of the gamer through an engaging, detailed story. The dialogue is very well written, and each event that happens keeps you wanting to play and delve into the mystery even further. The graphics are nothing remarkable, and you will be visiting the same areas frequently in order to solve easy puzzles; although the settings do change through each chapter. The small soundtrack is equally captivating, and it sets an isolated atmosphere that is generally associated with space.If you're considering picking up Pilgrim Episode I: Alpha Centauri, do yourself a favor and go ahead and indulge in the bundle that contains all four currently released episodes. This one will leave you wanting more of the story, and unlike other episodic games, it actually gives more than a simple brief set-up of the plot; you'll actually feel like you've accomplished something relevant to the story once you've finished the game. The good news is, is that Pilgrim Adventures is very active with this series, and more episodes can be expected in the future.All in AllSpace Pilgrim Episode I: Alpha Centauriis a good RPG Maker!8/10 From MeSweep"

You can tell they tried to make the game engaging, and not a boring fetch quest repetitive game.There is complete mouse support, which is great because there are also alot of things to interact with.The inventory could really use some work, such as making item merging more highlighted during crafting, (I had to click guess my way through item customization first time, but it was easy after the initial guess work.)There is a journal, which I found useful as a reference point, (noticed some lag switching between journal tabs.)The music is immersive, with a nice Mass Effect type feeling, although slightly more retro sounding.The writing is quite solid and humorous at times too, however there were a few spelling errors and points that made me think, ""Now why would a character say/do that?""I forsee the writing being just as good and better throughout the next episodes, and their future work.The writing quality ties in with characters and character interaction; the characters are pretty cliched, but not in a bad way. You can have several conversations for minor character developement.There are a few amusing one liners and situations the characters get themselves into.I enjoyed the pacing of the story. A few times I found myself interested enough to be guessing what happens next, who is who, what looks suspicious and so on, which means I was engaged, contrary to my first assumptions about an RPG Maker style episodic game, which usually makes many people iffy to want to invest in.All in all, I enjoyed my experience playing this first episode and was grinning as the game transitioned to the credits.If I were to describe this, I would compare it to watching an episode of Firefly; the episode has its introduction, then problems arise, then the characters aim is to fix those problems or mysteries and it all interestingly unfolds infront of your eyes. By the end of the acts, and the episode, things are wrapped up, leaving you wondering what mysteries and problems will happen next episode.Thanks for a decently designed, written and enjoyable game.- Nerf"

When I mean interactions with objects, I mean that you can pretty much interact with every single object and it'll have some sort of dialogue/description or some witty dialogue iniaed with another person. The story itself has around two parts to it with two conflicts. Both are rather short and at least did not feel like a grind.

It took me way too much time to figure out where and how many times I needed to click to use or combine items. Also, whenever there's a dialog box open, it seems like the mouse cursor doesn't need to actually be inside the box to choose an option.

This old school RPG has some problem solving, a good story with some twists and turns, & left me ready to continue with the rest of the series.The series was a steal for the price that it was on sale for, and remains very low even when not on sale. If you still love the classic RPG style this Sci Fi type game delivers with a charming story and a few laughs and unexpected turns.Obviously, there is nothing cutting edge or advanced about it. What you see is what you get. A short, simple game without too much difficulty whatsoever. If you are lookin for some push back or a game with a lot of depth, probably give this one a pass for the time being.Basically you can tell by looking at the above art style if this game is for you. If these types of games are up your alley and you are looking to kick back with a good story and not much of a challenge for a few hours, give Space Pilgrim a try.For more video game news & reviews be sure to follow the blogHttp://www.SublimeGameReviews.wordpress.com& follow on instagram & twitter @SublimeReviews"

As of right now I haven't played the other episodes but from what I've seen of this first one I feel like I made a good purchase. The overall plot is very light and the puzzles are very easily solvable. It is a very short game (took me about 2 hours with a lot of alt tabing) but it was well worth the time.One major downside though. The game is stuck in a small window and can't go full screen (sorta like Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis). Because of this, it seemed easier for me to get destracted by whatever was happenning on any other open tab.A nice, short, indie game with some very nice story elements mixed with a likable cast of characters. The bad part was that we didn't get to know those characters so well because of the rather short story.   7.4/10"

If it wasn't for this, I would've forgotten what I needed to do next.As for game progression; at times you're prompted to combining items so as to create a more fitting object in order to proceed further.The characters reveal in a very straightforward manner what their intentions are and what they need to execute their plans. It's a no-brainer really.It looks fairly easy on the eye and there's no brain-busting puzzles (phew!).I absolutely loved the portrets. They looked close enough to the character sprites.I find cohesion and consistency very important (in any type of game).This game definitely looks and feels cohesive & consistent (from character design, to environmental design to story progression).The story is well written as well and it made sense.It was definitely worth the investment (not that this game costs an arm and a leg - far from it).I got it on sale (including 4 Space Pilgrim chapters) + an additional game by the same developer (for the curious people reading this, I'm referring to 'Crown Champion Legends of the Arena') - which cost me less than 5 bucks.The developers are definitely not afraid of trying things and dabbling into different genres. I really like that and I appreciate it (and they use RPGmaker every single time).I'm amazed at what they've squeezed out of this piece of software (which enables developers to focus on the artsy aspect without needing to break their heads too much in regard to any intricate technical stuff).They really do seem like they care about what people have to say and try to implement feedback and improve their material.There's definitely great potential here and if they continue like this, I do believe they could create something beautiful & rich (one step at a time!).I absolutely love investing in people who care this much and are capable of delivering decent quality products, time after time.It's very heartwarming and beautiful to see how they're progressing with every title that is released and I am so proud of them, because they serve as a great example of what it means to start small, and grow bigger.I'm curious to see more! I give credit where credit is due and they deserve every bit of it.PS I wouldn't mind investing in some of the artwork :)."

The game is linear and offers no challenge at all (it is impossible to die/fail), so don't expect any replay value. The visual and audio design, albeit not horrid, is exceptionally average and uses a lot of existing assets (which, fairly enough, are properly mentioned in the credits).So what is left to enjoy? The story and the writing quality. Once again, nothing offensively atrocious there; it is just... painfully average. The story has as little depth as you'd expect from such a short adventure. The dialogue has its moments, with a few chuckles coming from the clash between the scientist's cynical demeanor and Captain Pilgrim's simple-minded antics... but that's pretty much it. Nothing really memorable stands out. Surely there was room for more character development and slightly deeper exchanges, even within the context of a two-hour adventure.I will most certainly concede thatSpace Pilgrimis fair for its price; but I wouldn't go so far as to recommend playing it, unless you're an absolute sucker for short sci-fi stories and you feel that actual books have too many complicated words."

While it isn't anything groundbreaking either in story, writing or character design, it isn't bad at any of those either.1. Writing is decent to good, with some endearing humour and enough detail to line out the characters. Hopefully subsequent episodes will build on that and build good, well-defined and multi-dimensional characters on this foundation.2. The story is good, some tiny twists and turns... I like that the background music forshadows the events to unfold. Subtle, but good.3. Characters have a good foundation, but no depth so far. That is to be expected from such a very short game.4. The sound design is a tad bit lacking in quantity, but what is there fits the game very well.5. Mechanically the game is very well done, for the most part. This, fortunately, isn't one of those pixel-hunting adventures - all interactables are pretty easy to find and interact with. The mouse controls seem to be a bit weird, don't really know why, but they feel slightly choppy and imprecise. Also, the game starts in windowed mode for whatever reason. Due to the nature of the game, this are just tiny annoyances, but would be nice to see them disappear in future episodes/complete release.6. The ""puzzle"" part of the game is shallow, but enjoyable. Most things are really easy to figure out, so far nothing to really strech your braincells. Simple but effective... it might be boring for veterans of this genre, but for relative newcommers like me, it was good enough.All in all, a good game, well-worth the price. I sure hope the follow-up episodes will be this good, or better as well."

It's a straight up adventure game.  If I'd used the mouse instead of the keyboard, it would have been a point-and-click.One con is that there are zero configurable options and the game starts in a *small* window.  Fortunately, you can use ALT-Enter to go fullscreen.  It still doesn't scale all the way (probably fixed multiples) and it certainly isn't widescreen, but it still looks nice.One tip: Do examine everything.  You'll find easily identifiable objects laying about rooms, but there are also many usable objects on walls that you will need.Also, for something with such a low level of complexity, I really wish it was cross platform.  I'd much rather be playing in Linux instead of have to reboot into Windows.  I don't know much about RPGMaker, but I had assumed it would help with multiple platforms the way Unity does.Looking forward to playing the other episodes."

The game tells a story of Gail Pilgrim and a few of her associates. Instead of being a hard-boiled space marine veteran, she's just a girl who's trying to make a living by transporting passengers and cargo around the galaxy on a spaceship, which she inherited from her father. She also has an uncanny ability of getting herself and her cat, Zubar, into hazardous situations.The writing is good enough to last through the games, and the story works surprisingly well. Don't expect anything jaw-dropping, though: the game is basically a point-and-click adventure game where you run around while solving some very simple puzzles. The game mechanics remind me a bit of the old Pokemon-games on Gameboy Color. Got a warm and fuzzy feeling playing through these games. Controller works, but there's one quirk which I dislike - sometimes when skipping conversations with the action button, it's quite easy to start it over and over again.Can recommend overall, since the price is pretty much that of a lollipop."

You have to make some decissions but I actually haven't found a way to fail the game.The length of the game is with about an hour for the price a fair offer. The story actually is quite nice, science fiction (Hard SF) with a female protagonist.This is one of the games, which uses the RPG Maker as developement tool, and the game actually shows that you can produce decent games with this machine.Pros:Nice Story. The concept is quite logically and has some tinkering with stuff in it.Cons:Very short. Playtime is about an hour.Very easy.Recommended:Yes, the game is recommendable, because the story isn't bad at all - it's a lot better than most VN's actually will ever be.It's more an adventure than a RPG and this is to be noted too.

I to IV).Of course, the background story won't go as far as in Mass Effect, and the riddles and tasks to solve are mostly on the easy to medium side; however, for that amount of money you should definitely give the game a try.Think of it as a SciFi novel that you buy in a book store for reading during the holidays, it's interesting enough to make the time go by faster and reread it after a couple of years.Thanks again to the devs, I actually liked it and would like to see some kind of Space Pilgrim ep.

I mean, I didn't expect to be terrible or I wouldn't have bought it, but when you pay $2 for a game you have certain expectations and this game surpassed them.You play the rather happless captain Gail Pilgrim whose routine passenger trip manages to go all kinds of wrong. There are plot twists along the way, some of which I saw coming, others of which took me by surprise. The writing is really quite good, with a quirky sense of humour that actually made me laugh out loud a few times. The characters have more depth that you have any right to expect from such a short title. At around 2 hours the $2 price tag feels about right. Nothing in the game felt like filler, though the pacing of chapter 3 felt a little off, though that could be just because I got stuck.Given the fun I had for the $2 entry fee, Im giving this a 9/10A few notes: This is a point and click adventure, not an RPG.Stock RPG maker assets but they are well used and all the locations feel well designed.Just for the record, I'm really impressed with what the Dev managed to achieve within the limitations of the      engine"

For those of you who have played Silver Creek Falls, the gameplay is similar, with it mostly being a story that progresses with you but you can't change the outcome of. Also, as I said before, I believe you could finish this in around an hour. This is a very ""talky"" game, and for those of you who don't like such games, this is not for you. This is not a complaint, as I actually enjoy such games provided the dialogue and story are well written and decent, which SP: Alpha Centauri is. The game has you play as the captain of a small space ship taking three passengers to their destination when something locks itself in the cockpit. You must find a way in. That is the plot for Act 1, and without giving to much away Act 2 has us land on a mining station manned by a small crew for an emergency stop following the first act, and the mystery of this new station and crew. Despite the shorter playtime, the dialogue and characters are believeable, and I enjoyed myself. If you enjoy little talky adventures, I would suggest picking this up.

,Recommended,429470,34675333,Posted: 1 September,all,Kuzhara,"The first game in a four part Saga.Alpha Centauri has you take control of the Quicksilver, a Passport/Cargo ship run by a Captain named Gail Pilgrim, whose last name is synonymous with the saga's title. Once you find your passengers, you head out on a journey accross space. This series has been enjoyable for me, partly because as far as RPG's go, this one has zero combat. At first I was opposed to the idea, but I quickly grew attached to the characters, adventure, twists and puzzle solving. Not to mention that I just love space in general.The only downside to the first two games is that they're much shorter in length compared to the latter episodes. If you're good at puzzles and such, expect the first two games in the series to last about a few hours each. Also, the style of game might not be up everyone's alley.All in all, I'd have to give the first rendition of the series 8/10. Two points were counted off due to the short length, but as far as RPG Maker games go, this one, as well as the others, are pretty fun and solid."

It doesn't offer a deep or long-term experience, but the dialogue is fine, the experiences make sense, and there's a surprising amount of drama in this trip.It may not be for you, but if you want to support people who make games, and you've got the money, and you like RPGs, just try it"

First 2 games are about 2 hours long the next 2 for about 4 hours each. Totally recommended for old-school adventure game lovers and casual players."
