(Takes 6 shots from a laser shotgun, AKA the slugger)WEAPONSThis game has a lot of weapons, and there may be more more later on.The Game currently has:-3 Melee weapons-4 Pistols-A Crossbow-2 SMG's-2 Shotguns-2 Assault rifles-2 LMGs-A Semi-Auto Rifle-A Sniper-A Rocket Launcher-A Flame Thrower-A Minigun-2 Alien WeaponsGRAPHICSI think this game just looks awesome, especialy the ocean in the shooting range, since the sounds of the waves are synced with when they crash down.SOUNDSJIMBOB did a pretty good job with the sounds, for example, I may seem crazy, but I think I hear some bird noises in wave survival. Either way, The sounds are great except for the aliens footsteps, which tell me exactly where they are coming from (Perhaps there could be an echo effect indoors later?), as well as when you swing a melee weapon, it sounds like you hit something even if you didn't (Maybe it could be a swishing sound?). One last thing, with shotguns the sounds that plays when you kit an enemy is overpowering the sound of the actual shotgun, which kind of feels like a bummer since you should see them ragdoll away with a big bang. At least in my opinion.ANIMATIONSEven though the enemys kind of flop when they die, it's awesome in my opinion You can see yourself as well as your flashlight isn't fixed to a single spot since it's attached to your gun.BUGS-None at the momentRecomendationsJust some things I think would be cool for the future, you don't have to add them though. :)-The blaster aliens could drop the weapons they have when they die-A kind of boss monster that appears in every X number of waves (not the tripod)-Maybe a debuff for the slugger, since it kills everything in one hit (on hard) except the tripod-Maybe secret ways to get into the currently closed off areas for better weapons-A kind of armor system that takes away damage, but has to be repaired. You could put in an item that's rare, but you can find 2 around the map, that breaks after a certain amount of hits. It could be limited to a game mode or not.-A weight system that determines how fast you are moving because of how many/which guns you are carrying. For example, if you have the minigun, that could make you go much slower. But if you have a smg, you can move much faster. This could also influence the stamina system.You should get this gameI really like this game and I recommend that you guys get it, especially if you're looking for something that doesn't cost much and will give you at least a couple hours of fun, get this.Keep up the good work JIMBOB!"

I would give a neutral review, but there is no such a option so let it be a slightly positive review because I believe the AI can be fixed. The game is quite new and updates are still coming out.

Something very sad has happened to the developer where the whole game basically got corrupted after his PC decided to restart itself. It would be great if you could cheer up the dev or something, he worked so hard on this...EDIT: A TON of new content has been added expanding upon the game, for example a new Building/Crafting mode which is like a Survival mode type thing, lots of new maps (Like Rendlesham Forest, Arid Wasteland, etc) a New gun, and loads more I can't put into good detail.Also, loving the new Snowing feature.Don't let the bad reviews fool you, this game is darn good.Now you might be thinking.But it has bugs and bad AI!No game is ever perfect and AI should be better really soon.I personally find the AI fine, they might get stuck on something ever once in awhile but it's okay.Bugs, I have not encountered any yet.The physics and animations are bad!Physics are very good. It MAY seem like they flop dead when they die, but seriously, is it really that bad?Animations are really good... Expect for some of the enemy animations. Those are a bit wonky but Jimbob can improve them, it's hard to make animations anyways.Unity Assets are the worst!Okay, I hate when people say a game is bad because it uses Unity Assets.What's so bad about someone using a simple Unity Asset? The game has a lot of assets, I know that. But JIMBOB can't make hundreds of models himself so he used models from the Unity Asset store. Why is that so bad? If someone can't model, they are still a game dev and that's what matters.B-But S-Something else is bad...?What else is wrong? The game has bugs, okay every other game does too.Now for the review. after explanation why it isn't bad.The game has a ton of weapons right now. Enough to keep you occupied for awhile. There are about 6 or 7 Alien types so far. The game has several maps and the game looks BEAUTIFUL! Nice survival food and water system and good detail on everything. When you look down you can actually see your body and the Flashlight is very realistic, by that I mean when you run with the Flashlight, wherever your gun is facing the light goes onto there.RatingGraphics10/10Gameplay8/10Controls7/10Replayability8/10Content8/10Overall Rating8/10I know a lot of you are gonna dislike this review, but you probably are gonna dislike it only because I find it a good game. If you really are that way you should have some affection for the hard working developer.Show some appreciation for the this Indie Developer.If you don't like the game... Wait for new updates, okay?"

Good luch steering anything other than the character.-Tried build mode and was unable to place objects, it appears no key was set for this and I did not see where to add it.-Tested out the firing range and was unable to spawn enemies from the spawner.-Jet pack did not work in firing rangeI am sure there is more, but after only a brief play though I have seen enough. I got lured in by the screenshots and though this might be decent, it needs some work and could be really great."

For example, there are a vast selection of guns, but some do a small amount of damage, while the rest do the exact same (A Sniper rifle, magnum, LMG, and Assault Rifle do the exact same amount of damage, they all just have different clips and distances they can shoot). There are alot of enemies, but many of them, once more, do the same amount of damages and are basically the same monster reskined to look different. And the Food and Water system is honestly out of place and just feels like something the dev added in to be able to say ""And look! Survival!""2) Enemies are honestly overpowered, while you are horribly underpowered. Every single enemy (Including the boss) Runs slightly slower than you and NEVER stops running, meaning that you cannot stop to reload at any point during a wave, and you cannot run while reloading. Some weapons, such as the magnum, are totally useless further on in waves because it does the exact same amount of damage as a sniper (The sniper would be useless as well, but it can shoot longer ranges than all weapons, which barely gives it enough slack to make it ok), and becuase you have to wait 2 seconds in between each shot. There are 3 enemies that do a large amount of damage: Rock giants, Aliens with blasters, and the mini bosses.They all run, once more, slightly slower than you, so you can only sort of outrun the giant. The aliens will stop and shoot at you, and their shots are IMPOSSIBLE to avoid, and they do a good amount of damage. Same with the mini boss who shoots a lazer at you, high damage, runs ACTUALLY FASTER than you, and unavoidable attack. What is even worse about this is that the boss glitches through all placed objects (Minus buildings), so if you try to hide behind a tree, it just passes through it and hits you anyways."

Enemies will just run at you no matter where you are.TLDR: There's nothing that makes this a game, but if you like taking screenshots, you might like this.I enjoy simple games and this has the potential to be really good, like I wouldn't mind paying upwards to 15 dollars for this if it was complete 100%.

Example, drop one or a few and then move to another spot.* A bit longer reloading time for the minigun..right now it loads faster then a pistol.* The RPG should do more damage I think.* A 40mm grenade launcher like the M79 would be wicked to have.* ""Inventory"" hotkey that pauses the game so you can pick a weapon, see the ammo, etc..Good, but very weird in a good way, variety of bad guys.. and some shoot back which definitely increases the challenge..;-)For those that don't live just for playing online against often rude players.. this game  is a good and cheap alternative.Thanks."

The graphics are good, weapons are good and what I found interesting were the in game settings. You can change the time of day, the lighting, brightness of stars, size of the moon, stuff like that which I found cool because you can have the experience you want. There is a survival mode I haven't tried where you have you have to eat and drink the food and water scattered around the map. As I said before the AI is horrible because all the enemies do is run at you, and seem to always know where you are. Another thing I didn't like is that it only has one map, it is a good one but the lack of diverse environments kind of sucks. I give this game a 6.5/10. This game has a lot of potential and keeps getting patched so hopefully more content will be added and the AI improved."

It was mostly positive with warnings of the game being buggy, not complete. The usuals for a very new alpha game.However, what people havn't emphised enough is the potential that this game has! A base building, open world, wave survival is just what gamers want.Throw in a little multiplayer here and there and your looking at a very good foundation to begin a masterpiece!Its obvious that the developer keeps in touch with his gamers, releasing regular contect ect.The game is obviously so far away from even discussing a completion date, but I bought this game in the hope that this developer will continue his work and really make somthing of this.Seriously, good luck."

Now that I have 13+ let me say this game FAR exceeded my expectations. Sandbox mode sounded INCREDIBLY mediocre, but let me tell you; everything seen in the survival maps can be customized in sandbox mode. You can create your own maps with an overwhelming amount of prefabs and make your own buildings! I do not think you can totally play them yet, but of course this is still very much alpha. Buy this game.Old Review belowHonestly let me start off by saying; it would be hard as hell to find a developer as commited as this one. ( UPDATED )The game is GORGEOUS and the MASS amount of settings makes it all the better.Gunplay is pretty basic, but still really fun to just spray hordes of aliens.The game has a few bugs, however. ( All bugs have been fixed in the 3 days since I postedthis review. )-Unalligned ADS-graphical quality glitches-Really buggy LMGThe maps are small, but that's to be expected both of such a new game, and the fact it's wave style.If you have $4 to blow and feel like a little bit of mindless shooting then I can't recommend this enough.I'll definately be keeping a close eye on how this game progresses!"

I gave a review after only playing one mode of the game, that being sandbox, now I have spent a little longer playing and now want to say that this game has really great potential. If the developer spends some time fixing things and listening to the players on what they want to see it could be one of the top games of the genre.

I really had alot of fun with the small amount of time I spent playing. My hrs on the game are more than listed. I would say I have around about 5-6 hrs.

It feels rigid, animations and enemy models are a ""meh"" nothing menacing, and later they get harder because they have guns, tripod enimies can be killed but are essentially bullet sponges, there's nothing unique about them.While playing through the game I was thinking, I wish I could get a refund, as much as I love seeing games come to life and an active developer, this game should've stayed in Early Access because it isn't a finished game, you'd have more fun playing KF2, put it this way, you'll have more fun changing the option to run super fast, jump real high and swim like you're gliding on top of it, than playing the actual game, heck the enimies are so boring, you'll find more difficulty through the hunger and thirst machanics than the diversity or creepy factor of waves.What I want them to include? a way to spawn more enimies so I don't have to wait so long to kill all 52 enimies. What else? Difficulty in enemy types not just more HP to knock out, it's a cheap trick, I would prefer 50 enimies with 10 HP each than 500 HP for one enemy. Lastly Co-op, I would find more fun chatting to a friend jumping around mindlessly killing aliens than play this by myself."

The dev is focussing on the alpha, which is like a playground to screw around with new features, which is surprisingly fun. The wave survival mode is kinda boring but can still be fun. It's only 6 bucks so I would easily recommend it."
,Not Recommended,429490,34742906,Posted: 4 September,all,American_Blackshirt,"This game is exactly what it says it is.  A Wave survival game.  However, exactly what you're fighting is unclear.  There are mutant lobster and prey mantises as well as normal and shorter zombies.  Hell, I'm pretty sure I saw a raptor.This would probably be cool, fun to play even if the the controls didn't seem so out of touch.  Not to mention my $1400 pre-built PC could only get a steady 56fps.  Some can stand that, but considering I run much higher on games like Prey and The Evil Within, I'd say the games pretty shabby.  Not to mention that time of day randomly changes for some obscure reason.  There's no story or context which is fine but it makes it all seem disjointed.  Overall I wouldn't recomend.  Sure, if you're looking for wave survival game with plenty of weapons and enemies to shoot, go for it.  I'd honestly rather play Halo 5 than this."

This game has alot of potential, don`t get me wrong there, but as soon as I started playing, my screen blinked and froze, there was delayed reactions (such as prone and shooting). I would recommend this game. Only after it`s been fixed up, alot. This game can be so much better with the bugs and glitches removed.I wouldn`t recommend this game at the moment.
