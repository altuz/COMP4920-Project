Honestly, you probably wouldn't want to play this game without the BMS mod. If that's not a big deal, then buy this. You don't need to play it through Steam since there are no achievements or trading cards to get.Oh ... and read the BMS manuals saved to the BMS directory. They're all long, but detailed."
,Recommended,429530,23923535,"Posted: 29 June, 2016",all,Falco[Ger],"TL;DR: Don't buy Falcon 4.0 to play Falcon 4.0. Buy it to get BMS.Not very good on it's own but amazing with BMS. Get BMS for free here:http://www.bmsforum.org/forum/showthread.php?26567-Falcon-BMS-4-33-U1-Full-Installer&p=374849#post374849Requires Falcon 4.0 to be installed.BMS runs smoothy and offers stable framerates, even on lower end PCs for the price of slightly outdated graphics. Setting it up for the first time is rather tedious, but only needs to be done once. The simulation is very accurate, and it offers not only the F-16 in multiple variants but also other fighters such as the F-15E Strike Eagle, the F-18 Hornet, the AV-8 Harrier and many others to fly with an advanced flight model and clickable, 3D cockpits.Not only do you get BMS with it's very good simulation and dynamic campaign system, you can also download additional maps like israel or balkans completely for free.It offers server based multiplayer with an option to easily set up your own for your friends, if you do some simple port forwarding.As all serious flight sims do, you require a decent joystick and throttle with plenty of buttons, switches and hats, as all modern jets use HOTAS (Hands on Throttle and Stick), which basically means that you control your aircraft systems without taking your hands off your controls most of the time. Unfortunately unlike DCS it does not allow for modifiers on your stick and throttle.It offers a serious alternative to the declining state of DCS, especially if you are like me frustrated with low performance and constant application crashes, even if it looks marginally better visually. Especially for the price it is just all around good.Beware though, this is not an arcade game. You will be required to familiarize yourself with systems, avionics, checklists and manuals. It is a combat simulation after all. But once felt, you will never forget the racing heart when in a dogfight, the excitement of flying into the enemy air defences to push a way for your strike package, the tense moments when you hear that missile launch warning and know you must rely on your skills to evade death and the sight of the mayhem you can cause with a modern, 4th generation multipurpose aircraft, such as the F-16.However, I find it rather frustatrating that they are still milking money out of this, even knowing full well that people mostly buy it simply to install BMS. They are getting paid for the work of the community, the work of other people who do this for free, because they enjoy to fly in a good sim. Especially consiering that BMS is at a stage where it is easily standalone, not merely a mod anymore."
,Recommended,429530,33386883,Posted: 8 July,all,Billy Zane in Titanic,"I think the negative reviews for this game are from people who aren't aware that the only reason to purchase this game is for the .exe file needed for the Benchmark Sims modification which is essentially a brand new game. If you want this game to not suck you need to download BMS 4.33, and then enjoy one of the most comprehensive study sims available today. It is *NOT* for casual or aracade style players. This game requires lots of study, and lots of disappointment until you understand the jet but once you do, it's so worth it. Thanks to the Benchmark Sim guys for all they do."

They've made a total bucketwash of the existing Falcon BMS community by telling them to remove the latest BMS update leaving people like me deprived of the BMS experience I specifically bought this game on steam for.Not only that, but the game on steam does not even work properly without the BMS mod which mistakenly, they removed when they could have still been rounding in customers which were looking forward to BMS. I feel VERY cheated out of my money because I can't even run this game stock or modded; leaving me to have to press retry and cancel every time I attempt to launch the game. Very disappointed by this company who released this on steam. Bad marketing because they do not understand the real customer needs and wants for this brilliant game which is overwhelmingly leant on BMS.If they read this I really recommend putting the BMS installation back up for 4.33 otherwise they are going to destroy a community which have been so hearty and productive in their abscence.IM TELLING YOU NOW PEOPLE, do not buy this game, because the stock doesn't even work and you're unable to install the latest BMS mod, I have been waiting up to 3 weeks for them to put the BMS mod back up since my 26th of January purchase which misfortunately was the day they removed it. Check on the bms websitehttp://www.bmsforum.org/forum/content.phpif you're looking to get BMS for this because it tells you a whole lot about the kind of situation they have pitched on the community."

,Recommended,429530,28982517,Posted: 3 January,all,Junta,"Get this only to update to the latest BMS versionIt's not just the lavishly detailed modeling of F-16 systems and cockpit, or the generous amount and variety of weapons to blow stuff up with, or the all kinds of ground, naval and aerial enemies to fight that makes Falcon 4.0/BMS what it is.At the heart of the game is the dynamic campaign engine, which handles the war across several countries in real-time, generating missions for all forces present on the map on the fly, working together towards whatever current goal is. But it's the freedom for the player in this persistent sandbox that truly sets its campaigns apart from the competition, past and present. Not only you are able to select squadrons or missions to partake in, but also control as many or as few aerial forces as you wish, by creating missions or even complex schedules for multiple flights to cooperate and even jump into active planes at any time - while campaign AI is able to handle everything you don't want to bother with.Falcon BMS (which is the definitive version of this game) further expands it with new war locations, weapons and even new airplanes to fly. Granted in the case of the latter they aren't as true to real ones as a titular F-16, however out of the bunch F/A-18C is the second closest to its real counterpart with main difference being the usage of F-16 avionics - but it adds carrier ops to campaigns.This game is a must have for any plane sim enthusiast."
76561198052976938,Recommended,429530,26152677,"Posted: 21 October, 2016",all,Triceracop,"One thing first: My review is based on the Falcom BMS Mod which completely changes the experience of the game. I wouldn't even try to play this game without the mod anymore. If you want to give this game a try i strongly recommend to install BMS first.To all beginners: This is none of this arcade flight ""simulator"" games. Falcon 4 is a hardcore F-16 simulator and you won't have a clue how to operate the damn thing. You will have a hard time learning how to fly it and you may get frustrated rather quickly. But if you are interested in air combat simulation and bring some patience with you, it will be a lot of fun.Why should you buy this old simulator, while there are so many new games around? Because you want to play Falcon 4 BMS, which is different to all this fancy new simulators. In other simulators you ""pretend to fly a fighter"", but in Falcon 4 you ""pretend to be a fighter pilot"" which is something completely different. If you are a simulator enthusiast like me, you will love this detail right from the beginning and don't want to miss the unique dynamic campain anymore. Take your time learning to fly the F-16 and better get some cups of coffee ready while reading the handbook and you will be rewarded with one of the most intense simulators i've ever played."

,Recommended,429530,23883510,"Posted: 27 June, 2016",all,demo,"This was a great game when it was released although it looks a little dated now.Despite it`s age, this is still a great flight simulator and one for any Flight Simmers collection.Download and install the free BMS mod, (Google it...), and you have an even better one.I am amongst those who bought this with the intention of installing the BMS mod and I found it a painless process setting it up. It installed without issue perfectly. (JFI I believe the mod only needs the Falcon.exe file as verification of ownership and installs and plays as a seperate game, -certainly I find that I can play it with or without the mod).There are a couple of negative reviews here that focus on problems with the BMS download availability, I have to say that this is a little unfair as thats not whats being offered here, (even IF that`s what most buyers are getting this for).So this reviews for the program itself which I still think deserves a thumbs up.Just be aware that it`s a old game so the graphics won`t be up to the standards of games like IL-2 and War Thunder etc"
76561198107300229,Recommended,429530,28974488,Posted: 3 January,all,Bf-Bunny,"Certainly the best simulation of the F-16 out there. The game will run stock from steam on Windows 10, but to really get the best experience download the Falcon BMS mod that updates the graphics and pit to make it look a lot better.Be warned. This is a hardcore simulator with many buttons clickable and functional in the F-16. Even getting off the ground is a challenge such as starting this plane. It's certainly for fans of the F-16. Ever wanted to get a feel for what the real pilots have to do then this is for you. Love being able to be in full control of a virtual F-16, then this is for you. The time it takes to learn is what makes it fun. It's also a really cheap way to get into the F-16 and probably one of the best simulations of this bird that you can currently get while not looking like a game from the 80s with the BMS mod.Don't play the game without the BMS mod. It used it with th hotas x stick and appart from changing a couple of the axis I was good to go straight away."

Pair this with the incredible work from the BMS team and you have STILL the best combat flight simulator out there in my opinion.  DCS is great.  I love it, and hopefully it will continue improving because their is only so much the BMS community can do with 90's coding thats in Falcon.  Right now, everything DCS has wrong in the realism department Falcon gets right.  Missiles don't nose dive of the rails, air traffic control AI actually works by putting landing aircraft in the lineup and directs you  and the tower intelligently allows aircraft to take off when their is no conflict with landing aircraft.  The dynamic campaign is incredible.  The ability to fly the beloved F-16 in the highest fidelity simulation.  I could go on and on.  The greatness of this sim is a testament to all the people in the BMS team who continue modding the code of this sim for absolutely free.  The do it out of the love for this sim.That said, their are some cons.1) This may not be the best sim to start with if you are a beginner.  Setting up your HOTAS can seem extremely complicated, and downright impossible if you have no idea what the controls even do. You'll have to do some reading and searching on the BMS forums.  DCS Flaming Cliff's aircraft are probably much better starting out.  Setup is easier, and you don't have to worry about learning the ins and outs of the cockpit to fly seeing as Flaming Cliffs aircraft cockpits aren't clickable, but you will learn how a aircraft handles in the air realistically, and you'll learn the basics of using the radar and the characteristics of different weapons.2) the graphics engine in Falcon come from the 90's.  Falcon BMS makes the game look much MUCH better, but it is still a far cry from DCS with it's modern technology.Summary:  If your a lover of combat flight sims, and you love going high fidelity, you'd be doing yourself a huge disservice to omit adding Falcon BMS (BMS modded Falcon 4.0) to you collection.Falcon BMS 4.33 Trailer:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcMOOOulhME"
