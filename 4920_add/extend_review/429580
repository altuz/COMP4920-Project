The game doesn't have a fast forward, history or auto-read. I makes subsequent playthrough a bit annoying.And no, unity is not designed for a visual novel. I know that some things are easier to do with it than with a game engine like Ren'Py, but the constraint are quite annoying : 200MB of ram ? really ? 64b system only ? Visual novels are great being played on small factor devices. For these reason, this is not possible with this game.Characters art are good. However, they could benefit from more movements and poses.Some special scenes (like the one in the shower room) could have dedicated graphics.Some art are a bit behind in term of quality, like the shopping scene or the beach one. This is acceptable on a first try. But only on a first try.Character development is... poor. Sorry, but that's something to work on.Story is short, so i know i should not expect a great scenario.As for the writing. Please note that descriptions are not superfluous. It does not have to be only dialogue.This is a good test (on the developper's perspective) for things that are related to a game, like monetisation and deployment.But remember, experience is merely the name men gave to their mistakes."
,Not Recommended,429580,20318791,"Posted: 5 January, 2016",all,LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME DOOOOO,"A mediocre visual novel in which a well-endowed Mary Sue gets to fall in love with the character of her dreams. Literally. Granted, I wasn't expecting a literary masterpiece (who was?); decent yuri fluff would have been more than enough to justify the price tag.But let's be honest here: 'mediocre' givesA Wild Catgirl Appears!far more credit than it deserves. Even if you can somehow get over the middle school-grade writing skill and all its typographical errors, the game itself is flawed at a mechanical level to a baffling degree; the menu is out of an alpha stage demo, background quality is inconsistent, the CGs border on nightmare fuel, sprites aren't always scaled properly and the painfully stock music often fails to queue as intended.Then again, what do you expect from a VN made in Unity? No, I'm not kidding, it's actually built in Unity. Who the ♥♥♥♥ does that when options like Ren'Py exist?! I struggle to think of anything more blatantly amateur.'Amateur' -- that's the lesson today. Character sprites this nice deserved better. Much better. Stick with the works of Hanako, Ebi-hime, Christine Love or evenSakura Fantasyif you want a competent OEL yuri VN; you're not going to find one here."

And the characters are pretty cute. However, there are just too many things that let the game down. I've heard from other reviews that it was made in only a month, but I feel that that still doesn't excuse some of its issues.The first thing I'll mention is the artwork. Some character shots are okay, whilst a lot of others are of pretty shockingly poor quality. Some simply show a poor grasp on anatomy (and not in the way of over-large boobs, as thats of course a style all of its own - more in the way of strangely twisted frames and limbs), whilst other genuinly look as though they've been edited in a couple of minutes in paints - like the originals, but with features altered or added with thick, black blurry lines. Other images seem to be have been scaled up and down strangely, whilst some of the backgrounds are of dramatically better quality than others.The outcome seems difficult to control, and the ending abrupt. Theres also very little in the way of actual romance scenes, though I only played through once, so there may be more hidden in there (though I doubt it). I was offered very little lesbain cat-girl smut, but to futher cement things I was also offered very little in the way of romantic story, and so walked away from the game pretty unhappy in general.What else is there to say? Buttons are unresponsive, and take some trial and error to find - they're no where near their graphics. There is very little in the way of controls, with the game lacking even a basic volume control.In conclussion, it is after all a pretty cheap game, even cheaper when on sale, and some may be able to look past its numerous faults in order to appreciate some hidden charms. If you're not new to visual novels, as I am, and are more willing to forgive, then give it a go. If not, I'd recommend passing it by."

,Not Recommended,429580,26119194,"Posted: 19 October, 2016",all,Nyx,"Even for £2, this was a little disappointing. I advise you get it on sale, in a bundle, or play it through a friend's shared library. There are far better games out there for free. Too bad yuri nekomimi types usually have a price tag. 2 out of 10 despite rather pleasant art.Positives:+ Yuri - female protagonist falling for female love interests.+ Attractive art.+ Catgirls.+ A few romance routes.Neutal:~ You can't really choose your name which is disappointing but not a deal breaker.~ No voice acting yet it's a cheap game so that's to be expected.~ Although Steam has allowed raunchy scenes in games, you're not going to get nipples in this.~ It has trading cards and achievements if you care about that.~ It references ""Life is Strange"", ""Pokémon"", and ""Final Fantasy"" briefly at times. Heh, I suppose.~ Starla *could* be viewed as funny and cute despite the fact I found her pretty standard.~ While the background art is nice enough, it doesn't change often.Negatives:- FRUSTRRATING UI. God, the menu crawls in each time you click to skip to the next stage and for somebody who already becomes rather overwhelmed by irrelevant movements (etc), this robbed me of a lot of my enjoyment. I found myself trying to read extremely fast so I could get by before the creeping began. I like to take words in slower than that.- Having said that, the ferociously tedious story soon had me fast-clicking through. Fluff takes forever due to the desire to wander off and do something else for a while. Actual parts of interest are short.- Clichés, clichés everywhere. It becomes so otaku at points, it hurts.- Characters I'm supposed to have some sort of interest in like Ria and Lise are simply not interesting.- No text history (however you can post PgUp to go backwards if necessary).- Fairly disappointing choices especially since you have to read through what some might consider gibberish to get to them and there aren't many at all. I have no idea how I was shoved into the route I had to take.- Is the protagonist 12? 14? 16? Sometimes it feels like being in the mind of a randy 8 year old.- Could definitely do with a lot more movement from character sprites at least.- Replayability is debatable. I found it horribly boring so I likely won't do much more with it.- Music is passable but it is on a constant loop. Not really any interesting sound effects.- The coding girl character Lise mentions Renp'y but this was first made in Unity and then Tyranobuilder. I definitely don't know much about making a VN but I tend to prefer indie ones made via Renp'y.- A rather important scene for hilarity and dramatic purposes is fade-to-black...- Although homosexuality is a key subject, as is bullying, I didn't feel it was confronted in a new or intriguing way.- Mary Sue, Mary Sue, calling Mary Sue. Mary Sue, Mary Sue, get lost now.- I don't get the chance to say I don't want anasexualrelationship? What's up with that? It's nice that the game is inclusive enough to add that kind of character but I should be able to quit the route. I didn't even chase her anyway."

,Recommended,429580,20342483,"Posted: 5 January, 2016",all,ｐｉｎｋｉｅｐｙｒｅ,"To start out this review, I'm going to go ahead and say that I'm a dude who really appreciates kind of shoddy/nonsense VNs, so when I saw this game appear on the front page of Steam the day after the Holiday sale for about as much money as I had in my Steam Wallet, I was in. I went in with no expectations or desires, and that was definitely beneficial to the experience.This game is just very innocent, like an 8 year old's journal entry except with a little bit more cleavage. The writing looks like the authors used only the 100 most frequently used words in English, so it's very easy and fast to read. This honestly would be a pretty good game for someone learning English as a second language. They go to a mall! A beach! A cafe! It reminds me of a Spanish 102 lesson, and it kept my attention more than a Spanish 102 lesson because it had anime cat girls with big boobs in it.Speaking of anime cat girls with big boobs, the art in this game is kind of a mixed bag. The standard character illustrations that you'll see the most of are quite nicely drawn, and they have enough different facial expressions to keep things fairly interesting. The backgrounds are fine, not overly blurry like some cheap VNs, and establish the setting of the game well enough. One thing that kind of took away from the graphics was the fact that I played it at the maximum available resolution (1600x1200) and the graphics looked to be scaled up to meet that resolution, which made them kind of blurred/pixelated. That resolution shouldn't be an option if it's just going to scale up and look terrible. I would rather have had a smaller window with sharp graphics than a large one with blurry graphics.When the art starts to fall apart is when the characters go off model from their standard illustrations. If a character is posed differently, their proportions become odd, their bodies or heads become chibi-fied in kind of a rough way, or they become pretty noodly and strange. It's very jarring to have a nicely illustrated and detailed character become a wiggly mess just because they needed a different pose, but it happens. Still, I was kind of charmed by this, so I'll totally let it slide. It made the whole thing seem like a high school project.The writing in this game is fine for an anime catgirl VN. It probably would have taken away from the experience to have this thing read like a good, detailed book, so its relatively simplistic plotline and treatment thereof contributed to this game being a fairly easygoing time. The main character is a closeted high school lesbian, which is pretty cool, and most of the tension with the non-catgirl characters that arises from this made it fairly interesting. It also was a nice stark contrast to see how the catgirls didn't really care about sexual orientation, which further separated them from the realm of the real. The game's inclusion of catgirls and non-catgirls to romance (or friend-mance? There wasn't a terrible amount of romance in this, honestly) made things interesting, although I ended up getting all the catgirl endings first because of my natural inclinations.Finally, the music in this game was surprisingly pleasant. It was incidental and non-obtrusive. There were some fairly long stretches of the game that did not have any background music, which was disappointing, but the music that was there was well made and fit the game very well. I particularly liked the chiptune song that played over the credits.Overall, I don't think anyone who is considering this game is expecting this to be an edge-of-your-seat, tour-de-force emotional rollercoaster (although there is a physical rollercoaster in this game). A lot of the negative reviews seem to be knee-jerk reactions to the relatively shoddy quality of the game, and that's fair. But if you're looking for a quick and innocent little game that expects nothing from you, then this is worth the three dollars that these devs are asking."

,Recommended,429580,20317643,"Posted: 5 January, 2016",all,Jaruri,"From playing the game for a little while so far, here are my thoughts.The game is simple, with the bare minimal to work as a visual novel.The UI could use a lot of polishing/work to look cleaner and more consistent.The 3 save slots could definitely be increased. There aren't too many choices but its better to have more slave slots then not enough. The character art looks solid, especially for what looks like the first release by this group (person?), but the backgrounds and variation of artwork could be improved. Text skips should also be included, so we don't have to wait for the sentences to fully scroll before continuing. There are also occasional hiccups with artwork being incorrectly displayed for a few frames.The story isn't too bad, though I have yet to finish it. The characters are all pretty distinctive, and play on many cliches and tropes. There are also a lot of references to the real world. (Intendo, Fire Shield, etc) It is amusing, and doesn't take itself seriously at all. The music is decent as well, though a little repetitive.The game is just three dollars though, and the store page screenshots pretty much show exactly what you're going to get, at this price I can say I feel like you could do a lot worse. Plus, this game has catgirls."
