,Recommended,429600,20392680,"Posted: 8 January, 2016",all,Vic=HKC=,"This game is a re-release. Indeed, publishers changed: it is now in Artifex Mundi's catalogue and I can understand why as they have the sequel already in it. Anyway, apart adding trading cards and taking time to put achievements, I didn't see any difference between the previous and this game. Anyway, I don't care having paid for this one. A -40% is a nice discount and the game at full price is less expensive than previously.Allow me so to take my previous review and to put it here.For your first investigation, you have to solve the mystery of several children's disappearances in Charmeville. But what to do when you realize that your main suspect isn't maybe as malevolent as you thought?I should have began by this game first before playing the sequel. The gameplay is the standard one (hidden objects scenes, puzzles, items to find) but at least, it's easy to find the items needed, even in the hidden objects scenes, compared to the sequel. Anyway, or I was blind in the previous release, or it was added because I found finally a map, which is easier to go through scenes.The graphics are correct, I love the fact that it's set during one night and that you're visiting locations like a crypt, graveyard, sewers, etc.. I love mainly when Artifex Mundi publish games that are supposed to be dark and creepy. It's better when they're writing and developing games but well this one is good enough. Besides, cutscenes are perhaps not animated but the people speaking are. Voice acting is also good.Given the price tag, I would say that now, you can go ahead. Even if you already own the previous game, it's still a good bargain. Anyway, I don't know if owners will get a copy. It's the same game, without improvement, apart for cards and achievements. It's just a change of publishers. True, games that were re-released were or given for free for owners or with a very interesting discount (Sleeping Dogs, Zombie Army Trilogy, Letter Quest: Grimm's Journey are fine examples of that). But I didn't mind buying it again. I've quite a soft spot for Artifex Mundi.Anyway, free copy or not, the game is still worthy for any newcomer."

The next installment of the series is 'The Beanstalk.'*CE - Collector's Edition*HOPA - Hidden Object Puzzle Adventure.Since this is an collector's edition game, it comes with some extra features, that aren't available in the regular edition game.Game VisualsI want to mentioned that the visuals for this game is nicely done. The visuals can be adjusted in the option menu.Game AudioI want to mentioned that the audio for this game is well done even if it's simplistic and somewhat repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the option menu as well.GameplayThere are only three difficulty game modes to choose from: Casual,  Hard and Expert.Diary Notebook it keeps track off all game's objectives and notes.The interactive map allows the player to fast travel between each location quickly. It also indicates there are tasks that needs to be done at certain locations. But it isn't immediately given at the start of the game.All of the hidden object scenes consists of traditional word list with little or no interaction.Most of the game's puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of them.There are seventeen different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the game. Each of these achievements do has some requirement before they can be unlocked.There's a bonus chapter, but it can be access, only after the main portion of the game is fully completed. This bonus chapter is the direct sequel to the main story.MiscellaneousThere are total of five different trading cards. You only get the three of those cards from the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading card: Purchased from Steam's Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and it's Booster Pack Creator.Final thoughts, I've found this game enjoyable to certain extend. The replay value for this game is low. I would recommend this game but not at the full price.http://store.steampowered.com/app/429600Reviews for the games in this series:Fairy Tale Mysteries: The Puppet ThiefFairy Tale Mysteries 2: The Beanstalk"

I read that this is a re release because of the publishers changed.If u like the idea of magic and playing this game in the night (the whole game is played under a night sky) then u will love this game. I really liked the colors used for this HOG. Plus the BG and voice acting was cool. The bonus chapter end leads into the Fairy Tale Mysteries 2:The Beanstock. So make sure u also get #2 to play.

This one is rather good however.  It still keeps all the same commonalities of HOGs (hidden object puzzles, casual pick and choose puzzles, color matching, tile puzzles), but it actually has fairly good voice acting, better than average animation for a HOG, and a music loop that suits the mood (although you will likely get tired of it).  Not very challenging, but decent.  Get it on sale.  Easy achievements, easy to beat, relatively low replay value."

I did not like at all.It feels like they might have been in a rush when they made The Puppet Thief.- The artwork isn't as neat as it usually is, it's blurry.- The Hidden Object Scenes have been randomly placed on the screen, it seems (for example midair or on grass where there's CLEARLY nothing there).- A lot of the story and what you're supposed to do to advance further in the game doesn't make much sense whatsoever.I recommend ANY other Artifex Mundi-game BUT The Puppet Thief.I guess I blame The House of Fables and Gogii Games as they were the developers."
,Recommended,429600,20597719,"Posted: 17 January, 2016",all,kiminoa,"Cute! I enjoyed the second game in this series, so grabbed this one when it became available on Steam. It has a bit less of the later bells and whistles, but the art is beautiful, the minigames interesting, and the voice acting is excellent. It's all very linear path, as expected of a casual point-and-click / hidden object game. I liked the creepy Puppet Master villain and the reveal that one of the scary puppets is an ally. The scene maps in the bonus content are pretty. B+ in the broader Artifex Mundi spectrum."

,Recommended,429600,26136639,"Posted: 20 October, 2016",all,Merrisephine,"I would recommend this game to anyone who generally enjoys hidden object games, but if you are looking for a deep and intriguing story, this is not exactly the place where you will find it. I will say that I was entertained whilst playing, and it is a good game, and has some all right puzzles.However, it is a bit on the short side, and I would definitely recommend buying it on sale, if you are going to get it - as opposed to buying it at full price. I mainly got it because it was on sale, and I have been wanting to play the second game in the fairy tale mysteries series for some time.TL;DR3/5, its okay. was entertained, i guess."

I'd say buy it if it $3-4 on sale but I would be more disappointed if i had paid full price. Very heavy on the hidden object scenes which i usually like but it was a tiny bit much. The main game is fairly easy but the bonus chapter had me scratching  my head at the flow of finding objects i needed sometimes and wondering what i was supposed to do.I have almost every artifex mundi game on steam but this one was not one of their best. The sequel (which i played 1st) is much better IMO"

,Recommended,429600,20573661,"Posted: 16 January, 2016",all,Rhia,Eh... it's a decent game but I found it to be too easy and the storyline/gameplay far too short.  Glad I didn't pay full price for it because it's not worth it.  Would be a lot better if it was longer and a bit more difficult.
76561198008914127,Not Recommended,429600,24756994,"Posted: 7 August, 2016",all,Wuzzerator,"This is a disappointing offering from Artiflex Mundi who are normally, in my opinion, the best Hidden Object games around. The story could be great but it's banal and the puzzles are often annoying. There are a number towards the end where you have to have looked at a sequence and remembered it, rather than it being written down in your notebook. That would be fine if you could leave the puzzle to check, but you can't! Instead you have to keep clicking things randomly in the hope that eventually you'll hit upon the correct sequence.Perhaps I'm being overly  harsh because of the high standards I expect from this developer, but I wouldn't recommend this when they have so many other excellent games."

,Recommended,429600,29213977,Posted: 12 January,all,DocCovington,"I played the sequel first and was thrilled by it, so I thought, ""Let's give this puppet thing a try, even though I find puppets to be scary."" ;)Turns out it was the right decision. A solid release by a very talented studio. Loved the puzzles, the difficulty level ranged from simple to challenging, but mostly it was above average, thus made the game still feel challenging to a comforting extent.The story was okay, and I didn't feel bored a single second. Played through the whole game in two sessions, that's how much fun I had. Yes, there might be better ones (I highly recommend the sequel!), but this one is still worth buying -- it won't fail you, I promise.Apart from having this stretched to 16:9 (probably because it's not a new release), the engine is well programmed and the graphics quality good (although pixelated on higher resolutions). What's always important is that the UI and reaction time don't frustrate the player, and they certainly don't in this case. Everything works smoothly.Thumbs up for this one!"

They have so a high standard for games both on the story side as well as the minigames and how both is put together.Regrettably this game falls below their standards. The story as such has a lot of potential. But it remains shallow. While one normally is told some backgrounds and often enough there are some twists in the story, both is missing in this game. Anything that happens is more or less happening to you, even as it is meant to be, it does not feel as if anything is really happening because of what one did.And while there are some good mini-games they are seldom integrated well in the scenary. And the farther you go the longer the sequences of just repeating missing object mingames. Which would be ok, if they would not just pop up anywhere you look. If there would be something else to discover.Yes, there are some good ideas for rooms or scenery. But while I liked some of them I never had any idea why I would go there in the first place and why anybody would buils anything like this.It is really hard to vote on this. Because, would it not be an Artifex Mundi game I would say: Well good try for a game, not Artifex Mundi, but good approach. Try it to support the effort people have put into this.But it IS labeld as Artifex Mundi. And they have proven multiple times that they know how to do it much better then this.As there are so much better games there to play from Artifex Mundi, I would advise to buy one of those others. You will love those others. But if you have already played one of those excellent games you would regret to have buyed this game at full price.Try it if you have either played none or all other Artifex Mundi games and you get it on discount. But do not buy it if you are addicted to their games and have other options."
