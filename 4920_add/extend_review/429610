You've been invited into an underwater complex, where dreams can be reality. Unfortunately for you, it seems that you may be the  key to stop an evil spirit...As usual, Artifex Mundi is a master to pick the games they didn't developed for publishing in their catalogue. True, some of them are a bit behind of what they can deliver but they're always above average. That's the same here. The Emeral Maiden is a real nice written story, even if some plotholes exist.The gameplay is as usual the standard one: pick items, solve puzzles, find objects in hidden objects scenes (list and shaped) and advance forwards. However, here, you can travel in dreams with cards you find. I think that five dreams aren't much, I would have preferred many of them, but they're representative of the life of your parents (safe for one). And I think it's nice to find items there that you'll need in the underwater complex. Also, you have a little helper, Atome in French, a little robot that can open specific locations. However, it's kinda underused for me. Anyway, the puzzles are quite easy safe for one or two where I took a long time the first time, and the HO scenes are usually simple except for one object I seem to miss during long minutes.If anything, the graphics are also nice and the dreams are a nice way to take a break from the architecture representative of the '50. You've been abandonned in 1957 and while we're now nearly in the '80, the underwater complex never changed from the time of your birth. Besides, you understand it quickly given the notes found that dated from that time.Also, the soundtrack is nice though I didn't really had a WOW effect this time.The Emerald Maiden: Symphony of Dreams is really a nice casual adventure game. I will not say it's a must-have but it's a very enjoyable game that is worth the purchase."

The voice overs are well done and the graphics not bad for an older game. I played it on my wide screen and it is a bit pixelated (especially the cut scenes), but nothing that would stop you from really enjoying the game. Also it has Steam achievements and cards for a great low price considering it's a collector's edition.* Keep in mind people that most if not all the HOG's on Steam are not new (they are only new to Steam). This one is from 2014 originally. If you ever have any doubts before buying a HOG on Steam reference Big Fish where most of these games originate. The reviews for this one go back to 2014. So for a 2 year old game it's not bad on current PC's (at least in my opinion)."
76561198042646749,Recommended,429610,34555716,Posted: 28 August,all,kris.aalst,"The Emerald Maiden: Symphony of Dreamsis a very good Hidden Object Game (HOG). It has an intriguing story, setting and atmosphere that drive the puzzle-solving, and the puzzles mostly feel original and at least a bit challenging. The downsides are that the game may be a bit too easy for avid puzzlers and that it looks like the developer was rushed to finish the game, which led to some sloppiness in the last part of the game.GameplayThe Emerald Maiden: Symphony of Dreamsis a HOG, so there's your typical 'point and click adventure game'-style gameplay where you collect items and use them on objects in the game world in order to advance. And then there's a lot of puzzle-solving, including the genre's typical 'hidden objects puzzles' (HOP) that show you a scene cluttered with objects and require you to spot specific items in that scene.The HOPs inThe Emerald Maiden: Symphony of Dreamsare of high quality, finding that golden mean between requiring the player to go pixel hunting and placing the 'hidden' objects so plainly in sight that no searching is required and the player doesn't feel challenged at all. The HOPs also require some more actions besides just clicking on hidden objects, like combining items or using one item on another item to find the hidden object.The other puzzles ofThe Emerald Maiden: Symphony of Dreamsare well thought out, although they're mostly rather easy. If you're looking for puzzles that'll have you stumped for hours, this isn't your game. But most puzzles do offer a challenge and will require some thinking to solve them, at least.The only negative thing I can and have to say aboutThe Emerald Maiden: Symphony of Dreams, is that the last part of the game seems rushed. You start to encounter areas where the mouse pointer turns into a magnifying glass, meaning you should read the thoughts your character has on that object, but clicking does nothing. Also, the game's texts seem to be typed in a hurry without a follow-up spelling check, because near the end of the game and in the extra chapter you unlock after finishing the main game, spelling errors become more and more frequent e.g. ""I need a heavy object to smach this display case it"" or the word 'business' misspelled as 'buisness' twice. Such sloppiness really decreases the overall quality of an otherwise fine game.StoryThe story ofThe Emerald Maiden: Symphony of Dreamsisn't very deep or full of twists, but it's one of the more intriguing stories and settings I've seen in a HOG. It screams originality and even leans to a fantasy steampunk setting, even though it's set in 1957 AD on planet Earth.The story revolves around dreams and an item that provides the power to control dreams. You play a young woman who was abandoned as a child. You receive an invitation to 'The Emerald Maiden', an underwater facility that usually only caters to the very rich. Together with the invitation, you find an old picture of you and your mother. Who's behind the invitation? Why are you invited to this facility? What is its link to your parents? And what wonders will you discover in this mysterious place?Graphics and soundThe graphics ofThe Emerald Maiden: Symphony of Dreamsare fine for a HOG. Like in most HOGs I think the scenes look very nice but static. I don't understand why they don't add some ambient moving objects a bit more often. It would lighten up the scenes so much more with so little effort, really.The music is atmospheric and of high quality. A minor gripe here is that one of the tunes starts with a slow fade-in, so when it's finished you hear a very noticeable silence of a few seconds before the tune starts again. The sound effects are sharp and spot on. The voice acting is top-notch.On Steam's extra featuresThe Emerald Maiden: Symphony of Dreamshas 5 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 while running the game.The 13 Steam Achievements are a mix of some story-related achievements, a few achievements awarded for not skipping puzzles and not using hints, and a couple of missable achievements that are awarded for some optional tasks, including a 'collection' achievement requiring you to find 17 roses scattered across the game world, so completionists will want to use a guide."

It also ends on a cliffhanger, it's not entirely satisfying)*Price($10 seems decent for a HOG, but that's a lot for a game this short - buy it on sale!)+ . + . + . + .I've enjoyed a lot of the games Artifex Mundi has developed and published, they offer up beautiful, lush backgrounds, relaxing gameplay coupled with music - and each game is a unique experience.This game lives up to the reputation, aesthetic-wise, but it was a bit disappointing towards the end.You play as a young woman, who was abandoned at an orphanage at a young age; 25 years later you receive a mysterious invitation to an underwater theater and enjoy all its wonders.Hoping to find answers about your parents, you board a small drop ship and sink to the ocean floor.And you soon find yourself trapped in this luxurious tourist attraction, with an unknown phantom lurking in the halls.As if that wasn't enough, you come across strange creatures, gadgets, and even a machine that can shape people's dreams!The premise is interesting enough, and the gameplay is enjoyable.If you're a fan of Artifex Mundi, you'll probably enjoy this title as well.The only complaint I have is that it is significantly shorter than most of their games and a $10 price seems like too much.It's a definite buy, however, you might want to wait for it to go on sale if you're tight on cash."
,Not Recommended,429610,28911998,Posted: 1 January,all,HimeJezabel,"Meh. Meh. Meh. Nah.Not godawful, but not good either. There are definitely better games in this category that make for better purchases than this.Story: You get an anonymous letter that tell you that you can find your parents if you let yourself get placed in a tiny submarine and lowered to the ocean floor, which doesnt sound scary at all. You then have to solve puzzles and find objects to find/save your parents.My feels:Negative: I feel like this game forgot a level of quality control. There are many typos in the game (minding my own 'buisness' with my 'revoler'), and the subtitles for the intro cutscene where out of sync for me. Also; can we please not have flat, modern keys go into oldfashioned keyholes? The soundtrack is decent enough, but I wish it lasted longer than a 20 second loop. Especially annoying if you're semistuck on a HO scene and it loops over and over again. Also a few plot holes and minor things that didn't make sense. As a final finisher of my experience with the game; I'm pretty sure the last 'boss battle' puzzle was made in MS Paint. Just many minor things  that built up and ruined the overall experience with the game, and the puzzles were unoriginal and too easy to weigh up for all the bad stuff.Positive: KittensAchievements: There is only one missable achievement, and it's near the end, so be aware if you're a collector.Final: Not sure why this got 80% positive when I've enjoyed worse rated games much more than this :/ Buy some other HOG unless you're a achievement/game collector. There are many better HOGs out there."

But I want to draw attention on one thing right from the start :The Emerald Maiden- Symphony of Dreamsis not a game for HO confirmed gamers. And be aware that as far as Artifex is concerned it's the first time I experience such a disappointment with one of their HO games (and I've enjoyed more than a dozen of them).  I see that on this one Artifex is only the editor and not the dev' team so it's understandable that the game may not be as great as theirs. But as the publisher Artifex should prevent some things to happen (I will give some specifics, later in this review).For me this whole game looks like a slapdash job. Some features showing this :-  For starter it's very short :10 hoursis the time it took me to finish the main chapter3times+the bonus chapter.Warning for achievements hunters :  I missed a rose somewhere I couldn't go back. Gathering them all is necessary to get one achievement (thanksfully there's a good guide for that and I used it during my 2nd playthrough, just to be sure). But then I had to run through the game a third time because one achievement (something involving baby cats) was still missing after 2 playthroughs ! For this I had to google translate some German discussion on the topic to understand what I was walking by !-  Than, the game is more than casual, it's very very easy.-  Puzzles (mini-games) are, as the whoole game, easy.-  Graphics are average.-  The storyline isn't thrilling, nor immersive. I lost interest for the plot midway.-  HO scenes are not very detailed.Now are things I can't accept (about Hidden Object Scenes):In HO scenes it's not impossible to see 2 objects that can be labeled the same way, like 2 rings on the scene where you need to find one. You can't click on the one you see first, you have to look for the ""right"" ring, that is, the one the game wants you to click on.. Strange.I noticed, at least, one lexical mistake (a magnifying glass labeled as a spyglass, while in other scenes it's correctly labeled!).I also noticed a same object from one scene to another, quickly after. If it's necessary to use the same objects in the different HO scenes, at least it should be done on scenes that are far from each other, not just next to!The game and its atmosphere are not dark like some games, this one is cold, icy.Nevertheless,The Emerald Maiden: Symphony of Dreamsis a good HO game for beginers or children.The little bot that accompanies the character through main chapter is quite charming. The child part of me liked its sounds and animationsYou have to gather little kittens which are cute enough.I just wanted to stress on the fact that this game is not for confimed gamers and keep in mind that this is not an Artifex/Artifex (publisher/developer) but only Artifex as publisher.Not a bad game though."

The achievements showcase was just a list. I didn't get reactions when I clicked on some things, which felt a little flat when it was someone I'd rescued.It would get three out of five stars but it's not every game that will just throw a half-lobster man at you with no explanation.

,Recommended,429610,21449308,"Posted: 25 February, 2016",all,HOGuru,"This review is going to be a little less precise than usual, as Emerald Maiden was the subject of the first ever Hidden Object Drinking Game, so my judgement can't be trusted 100%. Still, I'm fairly comfortable with the amount of attention paid to the game, and that this review will be fair. So, let's get to it!Emerald Maiden is the story of a woman in the 1980-something receiving a ticket to a mysterious undersea hotel. The woman in question is an orphan, and she has reason to believe that the preposterously-constructed vacation resort will have some clues as to what happened to her long-lost birth parents! Which is true, but there's so much more to discover as well!On to the Hidden Object Criteria!Criteria 1: To what degree do the puzzle screens look like a thrift store vomited on my monitor?It's fairly crude this time. The abandoned undersea facility isn't a new setting - Artifex Mundi already published a fairly naked rip-off of Bioshock, after all, but the Emerald Maiden resort just isn't in the kind of terrible condition that would justify the stacks of garbage strewn everywhere. It's a little more excusable once the player starts venturing into lucid dreams which don't necessarily follow real logic, but even then the game leverages dishonest design far more than is acceptable. There's basically every type of HOS cheating a game can do on display in Emerald Maiden - size, transparency, colour, placement - the game never encounters a type of cheating it doesn't like.Criteria 2: Are the searches justified by the premise/story?It's about 50/50 here. While the game is blessedly free of item placement screens, there are plenty of 12:1 screens, where the player is tasked with grabbing a load of garbage to find a single item. There are also a number of much more interesting 'item assembly' screens, in which the players has to gather a series of random items to construct something on the same screen. It's a refreshing change of pace that fits the setting really well, and is impressive here as it was in Clockwork Tales.Criteria 3: How well do the various puzzles and object searches meld together to form a coherent whole?Very well, actually. Emerald Maiden's puzzles are generally environmental in nature - finding items to interact with the world in concrete ways that all make perfect sense. Every now and then a discrete 'puzzle' pops up, asking the player to solve a game of pipe dreams or move symbols around a board - but they always make sense within their setting, and are never too aggravating. While Emeral Maiden certainly has a fantastical setting - undersea motel and dream machine, all in the year 1980 - but its developers have gone a long way to making sure that it's all internally consistent, and the game works well because of it.Again, my fondness for this game may have been affected more than a little by my state of inebriation while playing it, but I must say that, beyond some sloppy HOS construction, this a solid and engaging adventure, one that doesn't wear out its welcome across the 3-4 hours it takes to beat. Would it have been nice if the developers had put in a little more work on the hidden object screens? Sure, but that does little to hold back an otherwise stellar adventure."

This was one was Ok. No serious gameplay complaints but there were a lot of polish issues, for instance the English texts had a lot of typos. As other reviewers have said, if you're an obsessive Artifex Mundi hoarder, you'll recognize a lot of elements in this one. Not just the usual reusable puzzles, but some of the plot ideas. Wraith of Eden's underwater world, waking-dreaming stuff from Dreamatorium...There were some clever new mechanisms I liked, like the key-card access to the dream realities. Some of the character art was exceptionally beautiful. Rescuing the kittens actually kind of stressed me out, which I admit with some chagrin. Zombie attacks? No problem. Rescuing kittens, though? I'M DISAPPOINTING KITTENS!Excellent voice acting in this one, and it was really nice having the female protagonist's mother being the hard core scientist in the plot line (thank you!!!) In fact, there was a lot of subtle girl nerd stuff in this one that made me happy. Watch for some of the background posters throughout.I would've loved more backstory on the kitten-loving human-cephalopod-lobster dude; I felt like I should've recognized him from the Nightmares from the Deep series. Why oh why does he have a lobster claw? Who is this guy?Not Gogii's best, but good. The end sounds like they're planning on more in the series, and I'll totally play 'em."

,Recommended,429610,29076298,Posted: 6 January,all,Quiet Siren,"The Emerald Maiden is an OK, not stellar, HOG with several puzzles that are easy enough that younger players should enjoy. The story line is basic, and voice acting is acceptable. I've enjoyed other games by this company better, but this one is entertaining enough, all around if I could give it a star rating, it's be 3 out of 5.There are many typos in the text of the game, and the hot spots for finding some of the objects, and or interaction could be made tighter so that you don't keep opening them when clicking away. The artwork is not nearly as good as some of this company's other games. All around lower quality, but apparently I played all the way through it and therefore gave it a thumbs up."

Nice to have two types of hidden object screens (regular HO screens and fragments of HO) along with various types of minigames. Would recommend on if sale.
