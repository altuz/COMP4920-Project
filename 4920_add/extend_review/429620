76561198034960142,Not Recommended,429620,31705851,Posted: 12 May,all,thegrassyknoll,"So here is my review. I just pulled it straight from the discussions page where i wrote it. Sadly its all true, and none of it is subjective. These issues all exist. So if you can justify playing 20$$ to put up with all the below issues, have at er.Glitches/ bugs . update the gameHello,I purchased game and have played about 5 hours. I already have discovered some major glitches.1) When you win a fight, and collect reward, you are often ripped off out of your loot. For example almost any time the game tells you recieve more than 1 of any given crafting item, you only actually recieve 1!!!! 3 iron and 3 skulls as reward it says on screen, nope you get one of each. This happens almost every time, especially with iron, the ONE resource you seem to need for everything.2) Necromancer's toga: So i found this item( in theory best item and only body armor i have found) and have equiped it on each of my 3 characters. Supposedly your xp is to be plus 50%. It simply does not work. I even tried it on all 3 guys and tried killing all enemies with the equipped character to no avail. This would be a super useful item considering the bard guy i found started 800 xp lower than my first 2 characters.3) Why is there a 0.5 to 1 second delay on EVERYTHING. Now this might not seem like alot, but trust me it gets old real fast. Movement in dungeon, Closing any window ( i.e shop/crafting screen), Waiting for your skill menu to open when it is your turn in combat, then applying skill---this offense is the worst. This game took 5 minutes to download and is 2-D oldschool pixels. There is no excuse for this. It is immersion breaking and soooo slow tedious.4) No real options menu of any importantance. I have to alt-4 out of game and close window. Really? No difficulty options to make game harder ( neither being a total deal breaker ). No way to speed up that guarnteed 1 second delay on EVERY single action in game............And even worse, considering this final point is 100% automatic in every game in existence. There is no way to map keys.5) So combat goes like this...If you use mouse. Wait for the delay and your attack window to pop up. Select an attack, Click on enemy, Wait for attack. Rinse and repat through your lineup till you or enemy is dead. Sounds simple right? NOPE. Here is why. Your team is on left on screen, enemies on right. So it is like you are playing Pong against yourself! Even the default attack, which you will be using 50% of the time requires you to choose it out of the attack menu above your character. What are the game makers thinking?!?!?!.....Want to use keyboard to speed things up? You CANNOT map keys. So to walk in the dungeon uses the arrows by default, with in combination with the mouse means you will get corpal tunnel fast. SO you move your keyboard 8-12 inches to the left for proper hand spacing since events and fight options while navigating dungeon also require mouse clicks. BUT then your messed up becasue to shortcut the abilities in the combat is the 1-2-3 keys! Why cant movement be WASD and problem solved. That is why in the early 90's games took movement/keybinding from the arrows and made it WASD.So best combination in combat is to mouse select the enemy and keyboard the ability you are selecting. But now you are faster then the games 1 second delay on EVERYTHING. Now the delay becomes so frustratingly apparant it is game breaking.I like the content for this game. But how can you mess up the interface soooo badly and have me ( one person ) discover so many issues in 4 hours. Game not properly counting items you find? you are talking one line of code here.Yes my computer is pretty solid and can run games like Call of duty on highest settings multiplayer with no lagg. So the delay is not hardware related. It is not internet lag you will see when you play. It IS BY DESIGN somehow!!! wow. How can a game be over a year old, ( plus probably had early access) Have had 4 whole updates since, and not addressed any of the above issues??????This whole trend of selling more DLC when a game has such glaring issues is unacceptable and has become common practice nowadays. This is 2017, not 1992. We should not still be battling convience issues and poorly designed user interface. Stop updating content/balance in the modern age of gaming and make the game playable in the first place. Does anyone even playtest games anymore? Oh right, we pay to playtest for them now, with empty promises of updates that never come. The gaming industry needs to look at itself real hard. ""oh, i am indie and a small team, we dont have time or money"" ---so sick of this rhetoric. They already completed all the hardest parts of building a game( i.e building a bloody engine from scratch often). Then they dont bother fine tuning anything and just say 'good enough'The best hypocricy of it all , is that ALL these developers practically beg for positive reviews, as though mentioning these undisputible observations i have made is wrong. This game has such topic pinned at the top of this discussion page like most do!"

The dungeon building is pretty meh and crafting is very simplistic. Really could have done with some sort of non linear progression. Everything is move to the next stage. Stage 1, 2, 3, 4 etc. No exploration."

While the game supports high resolution displays, it also directly scales the touch-centric interface; so each ability button is 2 inches wide! I'm giving all iOS/Android games on Steam a thumbs-down until Steam warns buyers what they are getting.While the game play is fairly fun, if a bit of a grind. Lack of controller support and excessive confirmation of every ability would be good quality of life improvements."

You follow a fixed path from dungeon level to dungeon level, stomping the monsters and finding the treasure chest in each one.  There is a challenge for each dungeon along the lines of, ""Do it without losing anyone, drinking healing potions, or triggering a trap.""  If you win the challenge, you can play it again on ""heroic"" level.  It has some bugs and runs slowly.But the graphics are hand-drawn and jaw-dropping, right?It is ""old school"" which here means ""bad graphics.""  It uses tile-based maps and a JRPG combat field.So... deep character creation?  Customization?Sorry, nope.  You pick up heroes in dungeons along the fixed game path.  You can add stat points to them when they level up.  You can't even change their name or icon.  Later you have more than 5 guys, but you can only bring 5 at a time, so that means there's some tactical gameplay somewhere.But I'm sure the combat makes Divinity: Original Sin look simple, because it's deep and strategic, right?Not especially.  It's turn-based JRPG combat where each piece moves once, using one of three skills that are pre-set for the character.  You can find similar ones on free online games on the internet.But there's crafting and loot -- so that's awesome, right?Well... no.  You get a set of about 12 items per region that you can buy or craft.  They are fixed items, with no modifications or options.  By the middle part of that section you'll have all the best items the region can offer, and then you just wait to finish enough dungeons to get to the next part of the map where you get 12 more items.Is it funny?  Because they say it's funny.  And ""off-beat.""Oh lord no.  It's like listening to seven-year-old boys.  ""Are you a really a vampire?  But you walk in the sunlight with us!""  ""Oh,"" little-girl giggle, ""I wear sunscreen!  Really it's wrinkle cream, so I don't get older!""  ""Let's hit our bard because he's annoying!""So is there anything good about this game?I kept hoping it would get better, but it didn't.  It would be a decent tablet game for $1.99 if you needed something to kill time on an airplane.  Maybe.  I got bored.  I'm not sure why so many people seem to like it."

E.g. DoT skills are 100% useless because of enemies which are usually low-hp.-Bonus challenges- They're just restricting game mechanics, nothing creative. You can ignore them though.-Economy balance- TONS of gold and crafting material.-Not much user-friendly interface- Annoying blackscreen between menus, no hotkeys (for abilities, map editor,...), etc.-Repetitiveness-Limited gear-Bugs- Buff icons are appearing and disappearing randomly (or at least they look like they're doing that), Goblin shaman sometimes casts nothing but sound, etc.Final thoughtsI'd like to see this game for Android/iOS devices rather than on Steam. And I'm not even talking about it's price (15€)... I'd recommend this game in sale (at least 50%) only."

The WORST character progression I've seen in quite some time - You literally have only 3 skills on each character for the whole game and you can simply upgrade 1 of them each lvl so that it does a little bit more dmg)2. You can't change up your team (yet?) - but so far you get 5 dudes and that's your party - you can't adjust your team to the dungeon or anything. You just walk up in every dungeon with the same 5 people.3. Repetitive. (Has also to do with the first 2 points) - but basically every fight feels completely alike.4. If you have a decent ""strategy"" (well with so few spells it's not that hard to do) the game is just too easy - there was no dungeon that really put up a decent challengeMinor points1. The Trap-System feels completely random and pointless. What's the point of traps that let you untrigger them first when you step on them (and you always have enough stamina to untrigger all of them)2. Some Skills are just way too powerful (Whirlwind, Sleep-Ability) - Together they allow you to beat bosses with barely taking any hits3. You get WAY too much gold - you can literally buy Everything the shop offers every time. (Yes you need that gold for building your dungeon (which is PVP) but if you just play the campaign you have soo much gold floating that you can't even use in any way)BUT all that said - the game has certainly potential. And if they work on some of the problems I can see this as a fun game. (But seriously - Do something about the Character progression and character design - Only 3 skills that you can just upgrade a little bit on lvl up feels not rewarding at all)"

They are rather funny but even parodying fantasy game cliches is seen too often nowadays."

It was a bit fun unlocking the next level crafting to see what else I would be able to craft for my team.The skill building tree is much like other rpgs that have the same 'skill tree' system but simple.The story line/character interaction has some funny and clever bits, but there are a decent amount of grammatical errors that made me stop when reading the texts.Some of the graphics need improving such as: sometimes a buff can be obscured by other graphics when you click on it to read the description.%s seem to be in favor of the enemy; for example: if a goblin has 10% parry, he will parry 20+% of the time while your character with parry 20% will parry 3% of the time.While there are some minor issues here and there all in all, the game is quite enjoyable & a lot of fun."

Some are heavy hitters, some heal, defense, trap stoping, scouting the map, etc. And then you have some that are just worthless, looking at you Franck.I really want to like this game, it's witty, mechanics are solid; however, I can't.**The Bad**I cannot recommend this game, currently. It's hair pulling buggy, and seems to have gotten worse the further you progress. The game experiences stuttering lag that makes the game unplayable. It crashes frequently, opening any page with items causes a 20-30 second lag, the cursor has a 10 second latency. I'm hoping within the next few weeks these get pachted over."

However, all these do not give the game anymore fun after 4 hours.The game is grindy as hell, and very simple, attack, buff, debuff, heal, make items and repeat.  Look for stuff in a dungeon and do it over and over and over again.  The core mechanics which is its battle and dungeon explore system, so too simple for a PC game.

At least 58, which doesn't appear to count the 5-in-1 Castle locations.- Turn-based combat system is clear, and the character gearing options (each character has 8 slots)let the player try meaningfully different strats.- The majority of dungeons have a set of three challenge conditions which unlock a ""Heroic Version"" of that dungeon if met. Things like ""Max 3 Potions"", ""No KO"", or ""100% Map Reveal."" Helps keep things fresh.- No bugs I've noticed. Yay for no bugs!Neutral- There is a crafting system where your dwarf gains recipes as his craft xp increases. However, since the subsequent recipes seen to require ingredients only available in level-appropriate zones, it seems to just be a more complicated store. (Maybe more later recipes would reward players who went deep into potion tech or something, I'm not deep enough).Cons- There don't appear to be hotkeys for expected things (like ""D"" for Defense or ""Space"" for Continue), making for more mouse clicking than I'd expect.  (1-3 work for each characters attack options, however.)- The first part of the game- until you get your third character- struck me as a little grindy. I wish I had just powered through until I got the third character, I'd have enjoyed it more.All in all, an easy game to recommend given the apparent lenght of the game, meaningful combat system, distinct character classes, and price point."

While I have been playing I have seen several updates to fix what the game currently offered, was well as new content added in that has made the game even more enjoyable.While the gameplay can be seen as repetative at first, it does become more interesting as you progress. The gradual addition of enemies as you progress as well as new team members positioned throughout the campaign add a level of fluidity to the combat system so it does not get too dull.StoryIf you are looking for a truelly deep plot then this might not be the best game to go for. Instead the plot follows a band of adventurers that increases as you progress in the search for loot. The interractions that are currently scripted do push the plot forward, but seem to be mostly for the amusement of the players in comedy.CombatAs I have been doing this in early-access some of the combat has been a little off. For the most part it is a simple turn-based combat with the speed of each member and monster determining the order of combat. Each character in tern seems to be designed to function in a particular role. An example would be the dwarf being a tank while the bard from the trailer is a support/mage. While getting to a full party can be a struggle, it is important to note that there is no permadeath, so as long as the end of the level is reached you can keep progressing.MultiplayerI am not a fan of competative multiplayer, but this game has done an amazing job at creating an interesting system. Each player has their own personal multiplayer dungeon that they are free to create. They can then attempt to complete other players in hopes of aquiring materials to upgrade their own. As of right now being conquered has no penalty I've noted. Wins will increase rank, loses when attacking lower your rank, so pretty standard in that regard.As a side note. Characters still earn experience, money, and items while completing dungeons. So if you get stuck or irritated with the campaign it can be an alternative way to train units at the same time you are advancing your multiplayer rank.MiscRecently a gambling system has been implemented to cope with the store. The store only has a set number of items that restock at random after a dungeon has wiped the party or been conquered. The gambling system allows random potions, ingredients, or equipement.

Only the building levels later on. Which help stave off the feeling you are doing the same levels over again.The music is ok but since I usually listen to my own, I mute it so I can't rate it.I haven't played the multiplayer part but it seems you can make your own dungeons and compete against the ones others have made.

Tasked with with finding the treasure at the end of each dungeon you enter, and killing monsters and surviving traps along the way. You can't see what's ahead of you on the grid based exploration stage, but character abilities aid you in taking a peek at where some traps and enemies lie, and even just revealing a few squares so you can properly prepare youself. Combat with monsters is turn based as well, with some strategic attacks and abilities to turn the tide of battle in favor of your heroes, nothing RPG fans haven't really seen before.The real selling point and reason I ended up buying the game was the ability to build your own dungeon, and have other players wander through it in an attempt to beat it in a mode called Arena. While there is a free build mode that lets you upload more creative dungeons to Steam Workshop, you start off very limited in the Arena proper. I don't mind unlocking monsters and more rooms, but I still can't use signs or doors in my game. Still, this building mode is cool and I love games that let you build dungeons other people can go through.The dungeon builder is also a huge problem too. The game spawns bonuses and secrets itself, you can't place them, and nothing stops players from doing a lot of terrible things. Many player built dungeons are just five traps and a boss you can't use abilities on. No room for the game to even spawn secrets. There's no incentive to make good, creative dungeons in Arena right now, but I'm hoping with some changes it could be so much more.I like it so far, and I'm certain going to keep playing, and I certainly hope some problems will be adressed as the game goes on."

I finally ran into a huge wall when I was breezing past everything and suddenly the creatures were hitting me for the majority of my health each time.Crafting system is extremely simplistic as well.  Just form a couple of items found either by dungeon diving or purchasing from the store and you have created your new item.  You don't need patterns since new items are ""unlocked"" when you get to a certain level.Overall I'm quite disappointed as the game looked to be more in depth than what it really is.

It has a casual essence, without getting too hardcore, nor too repetitive.The dungeon single player part is fun, with colourful characters, and enjoyable banter, similar to many memorable live RPG sessions over the years. The game mechanics although simplistic do have a degree of strategy, and can get tricky at some points. The gearing up of characters is also great with a purchase/find/and make your gear, with the shop offering new items after every dungeon whether successful or not, and always rotating its gear.The Multiplayer part is also well thought out, where you can make your dungeon, and other people try to get to the end of it and vica versa. I do think that although beneficial to me, that for players to participate in this that they have a dungeon already created rather than the default one.

The developer told me there has more stuff will be unlock, but actually I just lost interesting when I right saw the store system. Otherwise, the development team talk activly with customers, so that is really good.Hope that game could be much better latter.----------------------------------------------整体的设计思路完全的手游，我是玩不下去。但是开发者很热情的找我聊天，希望能解决我遇到的问题，所以还是支持。"

I know that this game is still growing so I hope to see the level cap increase as more content is added, and the skill trees to further add a type of style to each character build. Keep up the great work, love the game!"

Very simple, but has a lot of cool features and items, as well as a pretty cool crafting system. I'm pretty sure the dungeons are randomly generated, so it's nice that it's different every time I play. Also, the idea of being able to create dungeons and share them with your friends so that they can try them out is great. Fun game for sure."

I wish that they gave you more heroes earlier. The mechanics of this game is what really makes it fun and interesting. Each hero is very unique and fun. It was a blast trying different builds with each hero. The crafting system is neat but really there are not enough options and you end up having tons of extra matts that dont feel like they do anything.
