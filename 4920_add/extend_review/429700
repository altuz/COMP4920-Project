76561198208766641,Not Recommended,429700,20358082,"Posted: 6 January, 2016",all,Philgoal,I really like the concept here.  I've played other games with the two character at once concept (Brothers for example) and this game pulls it off very well.I can't recommend this game due to its overly touchy difficulty level.  I don't enjoy figuring out a puzzle within 30 seconds and then spending 20 minutes dying over and over to actually pull it off.  Lemmings suffered from thsi issue too.  After a while the difficulty is more about incredibly precise inputs instead of actually using your brain.
,Recommended,429700,28953523,Posted: 2 January,all,Sweep,"About SquirbsSquirbs is a challenging puzzle-platformer in which you control two cute blue Squirbs simultaneously with one set of controls. Looking for an awesomely difficult game? That's Squirbs.Release Date: 6 Jan, 2016The StoryWhen you boot up the game for the first time, you walk over to a crystal and destroy it, and now you need to go find the parts and put it back together because you're a clumsy oaf and shouldn't be allowed around breakables.The Gameplaythe key ""selling"" point for Squirbs, or shall we say ""what it does differently"" is forces you to control two characters at the same time. So it's a multi-taskers dream or nightmare... I say nightmare because I like to feel successful when I multi-task, instead of dying and restarting like I'm playing super meat boy.All in AllSquirbs[/u is a very nice 2D Game!7/10 From MeSweep"
76561198041528015,Recommended,429700,25511429,"Posted: 15 September, 2016",all,tricosahedron,"Disclaimer:A number of players reported a bug where they can't play the game, because they get a black screen when trying to start a new game. I didn't encounter this bug, but if you buy the game, I recommend to check if there's a problem, so you can refund the game withing 2 weeks of purchase if necessary.Squirbs is a platformer with an interesting twist:You control two characters at the same time, which will respond equally to your inputs. So if you jump, both characters jump, and if you move right, both characters move to the right. For each character, there is a crystal shard in each level, and you need to get very close to them with both characters at the same time to finish a level.The levels can feature some simple puzzle elements like crates or switches, but usually the actual puzzle involves planning a path for both characters, moving one character freely while the other one is blocked by a wall, preventing one character from jumping by pressing <jump> while that character (but not the other one) is in the air, planning when to best switch your focus between both characters, and so on.Later levels introduce teleporters, surfaces that influence your movement, and other interesting level elements.The controls are responsive, and you move / stop as soon as you press or release a button or keyboard key. Jump height can be controlled precisely by releasing the <jump> button/key sooner or later. The only thing I don't like here is that you can't jump while holding <down>, but I only remember one level where that became relevant, and I beat it after adapting my strategy.So, is this a good game?Well, I greatly enjoyed this game, and would definitely answer that with a 'yes' for me! :)However, there are two important things to consider:1) The platforming in this game becomes very technical / difficult starting after world 1 of 4, requiring you to make precise inputs in order to avoid a mistake that means instant death, so it becomes comparable to Super Robot Jump Jump, Super Meat Boy, I Wanna Be The Guy, the bonus levels in the Escape Goat games, or Kaizo Mario World. However, there are no hidden traps, and each level consists of a single screen and takes less than a minute (often only a few seconds) if you don't make any mistakes, so it's still very much doable for ambitious players.2) The game is a bit unpolished: Gamepads are supported via XInput, but you can't navigate the options menu with a gamepad, or use it to skip a story screen that you will only see once / the intro screen. Also, if you have a smaller resolution (I think the game is designed with 1080p in mind), the downscaling doesn't look as nice as it could, and button icons or numbers are sometimes hard to recognize.Another thing I noticed is that physics don't seem to be 100% deterministic on a slower PC, so it can happen that one character is a pixel further to the right than the other character after walking half a screen width, despite a symmetrical level layout. However, this was only rarely a cause for failing, so it was mostly negligible for me.I was also a bit disappointed that there was no ending, but at least there's some satisfaction thanks to the achievements for completing it.Some other reviewers claim that it becomes just mindless trial and error after some point. I can not confirm this: For example, the wall jump mechanics that can be found later are implemented in a clever way where you vertically jump if you press the jump button (no directional buttons required) while adjacent to a wall. A smart player will make use of the option to wall jump without moving the other character, while a player that relies on mindless trial and error will fail in many situations where such subtleties are relevant for success. So thinking is definitely rewarded. ;)------------------------------------------If you like frustratingly hard games and can look past those flaws, or like to try out games with an innovative concept, I think it's definitely worth it.Also, if you waver because of the high difficulty, you can still consider picking it up and just play world 1 when the game is at a discount that justifies something between 30 minutes and an hour of playtime."

Let me explain.  Everything in the game is functional, but it doesn't feel right.  The part that especially doesn't feel right is the edges of platforms.  Specifically jumping off them.  Sometimes you have to restart a level about 15 times for jumping at the edge of a platform to work right and when you have to make eight similar jumps in the level, it gets very repetitive and boring.  This isn't a terrible game, it just needs a little bit of fixes."
