,Recommended,429720,20944582,"Posted: 3 February, 2016",all,MarsShadow,"""There is a way to turn an entity into data...""Between games like Undertale, Pony Island, and IMSCARED, the idea of breaking the fourth wall of the game to terrify the player directly is quickly becoming one of my new favorite tricks.IMSCARED is the full retail version of the original, much smaller game of the same name released back in 2012. If you've heard of it or seen any gameplay videos or Let's Plays, chances are you're already aware of the game's central ""gimmick"". If you'd prefer to go into the game blind (which I recommend) then don't read any further. IMSCARED is a good game for a very cheap price. Worth the play.If you're curious, then read on: IMSCARED's main idea is that the game will mess with your computer itself to deceive, attack, and scare you. Essentially created a horror game acting like a malicious, haunted virus. Right off the bat the game automatically creates a folder on your desktop where it will send you messages, sometimes to aid you, and other times to taunt you. The ways the game requires you to think outside the box and the ways it uses your computer become more creative and more clever as the game goes on. For a gimmick, it's a well implemented gimmick.It should be noted that when I say the game's tricks get more clever as you go along, the entire game really is the same way. The first gameplay section of IMSCARED (past the short tutorial) is the original 2012 game in it's entirety with one or two very minor changes. Compared to the rest of the game afterwards, the beginning segment feels amateur, and it's not a great testament to what the game had up it's sleeve. It feels very much like the developer took the original game and has been building and improving on it since 2012, leaving the segment feeling a tad uneventful and slow (not that the segment is bad, mind you, but the rest of the game just feels a lot better).You're probably going to either tolerate or hate the graphics. It's VERY low-res and can make finding small object sprites hard. On the flipside, it does help push the idea that ""this is a video game that's acting very wrong"". Movement can be annoying, as the game has a tendency of having you get stuck on objects or even in narrow corridors, especially when running.The game's no Silent Hill 2, but it has some fun, creative scares and incredibly creepy atmospheres, especially when it incorperates the gimmick of a haunted video game. Even the least subtle parts are still better than many cheap indie horror games.Much of the gameplay consists of puzzles, which get better as the game goes on and it fully utilizes the central idea to it's potential, even if there's a bit overreliance on keyhunting, usually there's more than just backtracking to keep it interesting.Overall, for four dollars, IMSCARED is a good game to check out. Maybe it won't for your style if you can't suspend some disbelief at times, but if you can, then I believe you're in for an enjoyable and scary ride."

This truly is a game where you need to be blind as possible! The only thing you need to know is make sure the game is installed to the C: drive!I have completed all the Silent Hill games,Resident Evils,Fatal Frames,Condemneds,F.E.A.Rs,Amnesia,Penumbra,Outlast,and countless other horrors. IMSCARED does something none of these could ever do. It achieved the ultimate goal of a horror game, it went further than just being a game. It was a real, paranoia induced horror experience. I'd write an in depth piece but that would just ruin the experience for you! If you love horror at all, YOU NEED TO PLAY THIS!Be warned though. It IS watching you."
,Not Recommended,429720,20988845,"Posted: 5 February, 2016",all,Lesbian Lucario,"This review contains spoilers.I tried really hard to like IMSCARED. A game that has the player interacting with an entity that communicates with them by creating text files on the player's desktop is intriguing. The visual style, while not entirely original, feels dated, a commonly overlooked way to create unease with the player. The game's price point is also low and suitable for a game with this level of content. However, IMSCARED stumbles in a lot of areas and left me frustrated with it. I'll break down what I didn't like about the game.1. I said in my introductory paragraph that I found the interaction between the player and the game to be intriguing. While it is, it's also a bit awkwardly implemented. There are several points in the game where you need to be reading a text file while playing the game. During these segments, you can put the game in windowed mode, but the window is incredibly tiny and the controls sometimes glitch out while you're trying to go back and forth between the text file and game.2. The game ""crashes"" and closes itself on several occasions. This harkens back to Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem and the original Metal Gear Solid, where the game attempts to fool the player into thinking that the game is actually interacting with something in the real world. I initially didn't mind this, but the game began to abuse it. If you get caught by the monster at certain points in the game, the game will close and you'll be brought back to your desktop. There were points where you're required to solve puzzles with little to no conveyance as the monster chases you around the environment. If you get caught, you're brought back to your desktop, losing your progress up until the start of the puzzle. I actually took breaks from this fairly short game because I was so frustrated with my constant failures. I also imagine my Steam friends were getting annoyed, constantly seeing me start and stop playing the game. If the game maybe brought you back to the menu screen when you died rather than completely closing out, this wouldn't be so much of an issue.3. Jump scares, jump scares, jump scares. I see a lot of reviews praising this game for being ""truly scary"", but I see very little criticism of its over-reliance on jump scares. While I'll admit that the game made me feel uneasy at times with its retro atmosphere and creepy ambience, there were way more occasions where something would pop out and make a loud noise at me for a cheap scare. There are points where an overlay will flash on the screen with a loud noise and the game will close, something entirely jumpy and even more forgettable. The worst offender, however, is a puzzle about 3/4 of the way through the game where the player is tasked with finding record players in a maze and destroying them. You're being chased by the monster during this segment, but weird figures will come down from the ceiling and screech at you for absolutely no reason. They add nothing to the experience at all and don't play into the puzzle in any way, just being added as cheap scares to make the situation less scary than it would have been if you were simply being chased.4. The game is somewhat fragmented. There isn't really a hub location until the very end of the game, and the areas you're going through have little to nothing to do with one another. You go to a supermarket, a train station, a basement area and a hedgemaze throughout the course of the game. These areas aren't really connected to each other until the very end, and even then the game only connects them through a series of doors that teleport you to these areas. Some of the areas even require you to input different things into a text prompt, something that is vital near the end of the game if you didn't get all of the achievements (I'll expand on this later). Overall, you find yourself teleporting from area to area. The game will close, and you'll find yourself in an entirely new location without any explanation as to why. As a result, nothing feels familiar and the game feels stitched together, like a collection of different ideas.5. Movement is awkard and actually somewhat buggy. It's fairly simple, being mapped to the WASD keys for moving, the Shift key for sprinting, and the Ctrl key for crouching. However, it's easy to get ""caught"" on objects, requiring you to reposition the camera in order to move again. If you want to try this, you simply need to walk along a wall and rotate the camera towards it. You'll eventually get stuck and won't be able to move unless you rotate the camera away from the wall. This wouldn't be so bad if there were actual segments where you need to get through cramped spaces and you're constantly getting stuck on both sides of the wall. There's also a segment where you're being chased through a hallway, and while I only got caught on a bookshelf once, it still exemplified how buggy the movement is. It's also worth noting that if you crouch next to certain objects, you can clip through them, which looks very awkward and allows you to peer inside some things.6. Near the end of the game, the player is about to go through the last door when the game prompts them that they need to get all of the achievements in order to proceed. At first I thought this was a trick, but it's serious. Closing the game will bring you back to the start of the game, which has opened up some new doors to previous parts of the game where you can obtain these achievements. When I started this game, it was less than a week old. The achievement list gives absolutely no clues as to how the achievements are obtained and the discussion board was barren of help. This left me stumbling about, trying to figure out how to get the last few achievements so that I could actually finish the game. Some of these achievements are incredibly obscure, requiring you to do things like knock on a wall and set your system clock to certain times in order to get some items. Achievements are meant to entertain completionists, not frustrate people who just want to experience the game.I truly, dearly wanted to enjoy IMSCARED. It does some really interesting things and has a very low price point. However, the times where I was wowed were undermined by the amount of times I was frustrated or disappointed. In the end, this is just a short indie horror game with lots of jump scares and a somewhat entertaining fourth-wall mechanic. It's not incredibly noteworthy and I can think of other games that do fourth-wall breaking better with less frustrations and more polish."

This new version adds about another hour of content, and so many new ideas that it STILL feels so fresh and terrifying after four years. The original and the workshop edition are perfectly blended together to create a flawless beggining to the game, and once the familiar is gone, your are thrown right into the deep end. There are new chase sequences, new story elements, and new interactions the game has with you computer that is just amazing. You will have to interact with files, interact with the Internet, and interact with your clock to progress through the game. Also, the dev is amazing. I had a glitch in my game, posted it on the discussion, and he fixed it in thirty minutes.

,Recommended,429720,21038583,"Posted: 7 February, 2016",all,JohnWolfeYT,"If you're interested in ""metahorror"" - the fourth-wall breaking, game-is-alive bag of tricks found in other games like Pony Island, Undertale and Eternal Darkness, IMSCARED is worth a look.The full release version of a free game that surfaced on the internet in 2012 called ""ImScared: A Pixelated Nightmare"", IMSCARED's Steam version contains 2-3 hours of start-stop gameplay in which it repeatedly crashes, ""ends"", or cheats in some way to force you out of the game and restart it.While the stop-and-go gameplay is jarring at first, it's eventually desensitizing. Thankfully, IMSCARED adjusts itself with this in mind, and drops the shock-seeking act in favor of unique puzzle solving that intertwines what you do inside the game with what you do outside of it. You'll transition from being a victim of IMSCARED's shenanigans to learning how to use them to your advantage, but despite gaining control you'll still feel uncomfortable not knowing what's going to happen next.The implementation isn't flawless by any means - the uphill climb to the game's ending may prove more frustrating than frightening for some, and certain sequences may result in death desensitization. In certain places, IMSCARED is a little too particular about what you have to do in order to progress, and there is potentially a great deal of backtracking required to collect everything required to complete the game.Even so, the feeling of playing a game that's actively plotting against you is done to a T in IMSCARED, and if that's a feeling you'd like to chase - especially if Pony Island/Undertale whet your appetite - then IMSCARED delivers.(A word of warning, currently Windows 10 users are reporting rampant problems with the game's file-creation mechanic - which is required to progress and ultimately complete the game. Avoid if you're a Win10 user, until/unless that functionality is patched.)"

,Recommended,429720,21002511,"Posted: 6 February, 2016",all,europa,"I first played IMSCARED back in 2012, when the GameJolt edition was just out.Being italian myself, I was - sadly - skeptic about its value, because we're notoriously bad at making games. I'll admit I was blown away. The low-fi visuals and audio, the fourth-wall breaking, the Yume Nikki vibe. All in all, a well-thought, hand-crafted piece of eeriness. I liked it so much I kept that version for years and gave it a play every now and then, showing it to some of my friends as well.Then, February 2016 came and on twitter I saw my friend benzoin-gum re-tweeting Ivan's announcement about the Steam release - that was a really nice surprise, and I thought I owed Ivan a beer for the entertaining he's granted me years before, free of charge. Hence I bought it, and that was it, I didn't evenwantto play it again initially, but shortly after I caved in and gave it a go.Lo and behold, there were a bunch of new areas to explore, new stuff to see and hear. New chapters, and secrets. I didn't know that, it was a very welcomed surprise. Yes, the game still lives to its old expectations and surpasses itself in this expanded version. I'm one achievement short from completion, but I reckon it won't be long due.For the price of a pint of beer, I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes Yume Nikki, or had at least one dream in their lifetime where everything was bright yet the sky lied still, and black.update: 100%The last chapter was very intensive and frightening. This game is worth your money."

,Recommended,429720,30696570,Posted: 23 March,all,Malkavian,"Disclaimer:There's two ways to approach the decision of whether or not to buy this game, and I'll explain why right after. You can download and play the free version ofIMSCAREDwhere you will only be able to play Chapter 1. If you like it enough to want to play the actual complete version of the game, buy it here. The only downside is that youwillhave to replay Chapter 1 once you purchase it. Otherwise, stop reading about this game now, buy it, and take it from there. The reason I say this is becauseIMSCAREDis an indie metahorror game that plays like a blurry fever dream. It's a niche addition to an already obscure and underplayed sub-genre of horror adventure games that might mess with people's standards of what to expect from an adventure horror game.IMSCAREDis a metahorror fever dream that has you as the protagonist. It creates a desktop folder where it will upload .txt, .htm .config files that you will have to read and alter in order to progress throught the game. It's an incredibly ingenious game that will have you oscillating between the game, the desktop folder and whatever linksithas you follow. If you stick around the end credits you will see one of the creators decided you claim anonimity through the witty pseudonym of ""you see? you can do so much with so little"" (or something like that). I think that's cute and funny. But most importantly, purposefully or not, I think that illustrates the core philosophy ofIMSCARED. The sound was created using FL Studio 10, the game itself was made with the help of GameJolt and the graphis are pixelated! Yet, this game manages to produce crips and jarring sound effects that, if played with the volume on mid/high, will undoubtedly scare you. Despite utilizing the one of the 'lowest' forms of visual illustration, it manages to craft cozy and interesting levels filled with inexplicable nostalgia and mystery.Furthermore, whereIMSCAREDshines is through its script. The .txt files the game creates in your desktop folder comprise an apocalyptic log that compliments the eerie sense of being watched byWhite Facethroughout the whole game.#Discussions_QuoteBlock_AuthorThere is a way to turn an entity into data. They have a life of their own, and it is difficult to disntinguish them from normal computer files. In our actions of everyday, while we sit at the computer, this byte entity observes us, and studies our every move and fear.This is one of the first messagesIMSCAREDcreates in your computer and it is oddly profound for a pixelated game. A philosophical question at heart, admittedly fiction at the moment, but engaging to ponder. That is the main premise of the game --consciousness transferred into data-- and it executes it fairly effective for its medium.IMSCAREDdecidedly establishes it's place amongst other similar games, such asUndertale,Pony IslandandEternal Darkness; and that, although not entirely horror, effectively break the 4th wall and interact directly with the player.If you enjoy the way I review games, join and follow my curator group!

,Recommended,429720,25959310,"Posted: 9 October, 2016",all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"IMSCARED started as a small indie project that was available for download over the course of its beta period. After the game became more refined and was eventually completed, it found its way on to Steam in early 2016. Gamers that may have played the title in its beta stage are in for a treat, as it has changed quite a bit since its early days. So for old players, there's something new, and for new players, well... you're in over your head; you may want to turn back before it's too late.You may be thinking that this title looks like crap. Well, you're not wrong. Visually, it's like playing Resident Evil or Alone in the Dark from the first Playstation in first-person mode. The edges are jagged, it's blocky, it's pixelated to the point that text can be hard to read, and it only runs at 40 FPS. But looks, well they're not everything as any good gamer should know. The extremely limited view distance enhances the atmosphere of the game, making it all the more tense and suspenseful. There's also no real soundtrack to speak of, rather the game relies heavily on sound effects; this is a hard stunt to pull off, but in this case it works wonderfully.IMSCARED is a horror game like no other. You may think that you're playing it, but in reality it's playing you. It's a game that's often mistaken for a virus (which it isn't, it's impossible for a game downloaded directly from Steam to contain one) due to the fact that it monopolizes your computer; it'll open new browser tabs, create new folders and text files, and even feign the dreaded blue screen of death. It wants you to think it's a virus. It's deceitful, a liar, it antagonizes you, it dares you to keep playing it despite its repeated on-purpose crashing. It's a horror game that truly messes with your mind, not only in atmosphere and gameplay, but in the actions that it performs outside of the game. It'll stay in your head even after you're through with it... because you're not done with IMSCARED until it's done with you.So by now you're probably wondering what you actually do in this game. I'm trying to tread lightly because I'd hate to spoil this title for anyone, and if I give a basic outline it'll sound like a key finding simulator. IMSCARED is a very hard game to describe without ruining the experience. Sure you find keys and open doors, solve little puzzles here and there, but the further you go along in the story, the more the game plays YOU. False endings, fake crashes, purposful glitches, it's all part of the psychological screw-with-you mechanic that makes this title so absurdly special.There are only two things wrong with this entire event, and the first one is a very complicated puzzle near the middle of the game. There's a part involving some gramophones and the objective is to run around and shut them off; all the while being pursued by one of the antagonists. You must use audio clues to help find the direction to go to find the gramophones, but it's really difficult to decipher and usually you're led to a dead end. This puzzle is more frustrating than it is fun, and it was almost the end of my stint with the game. The second is that you must have obtained all of the achievements except one before proceeding to the final stage. The backtracking can get annoying, and I'm sure my friends were sick of seeing ""Belphegore is playing IMSCARED"" pop up every couple of minutes due to what had to be done to go back to obtain some missing trophies.Other than the two downfalls of IMSCARED, it truly is one of the most unparalleled horror games to come to life in recent years. As far as I know, there's really nothing else out there quite like it, and it'll really leave you guessing until the very end; beware, it may not really be the end and there may be more that you've yet to uncover! It would be out of this world to see a follow-up to this title, or anything else from this developer at all. He definitely has a creative and artistic mind that thinks way outside the box, and it's amazing that this game was made using so very little tools. If you really want a horror game that'll completely blow your mind, you absolutely have to play IMSCARED.Rating:5.0/5.0- An astonishing achievement, this game must be played.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"

It actually reminded me a lot of a different horror game I've played called I See You. It's the kind of game that makes you think you're playing the role of a character, but the game actually makes it feel like it's trying to interact directly with you, the player behind the screen.And it's exactly for that reason that the game manages to be so disturbing. I won't spoil the actual mechanics the game uses to interact with the player, but I can say it'll catch a lot of people by surprise - and often. It constantly tricks the player into thinking he/she has accomplished something or that they've finished the game, only to then reveal something new.The only flaw I've found in the game is movement. While the actual controls work as intended, it's easy to get stuck at walls, which can be a problem when you're trying to run from something. Also, for some reason, you can't strafe when crouching. It's not actually a problem, but it feels weird.Overall, if I had to compile a list of must-play horror games, IMSCARED would definitely be included."

Fantastic game, very spooky. Occasionally IMSCARED gets slowed down by some annoying puzzles but if you stick with it, the journey is very worth it.Sorry to everyone on my friends list who got alerts for me popping viciously in and out in and out of this game for a few hours.

To say much more is to spoil what makes this game unique.The relatively spoiler free version of the gameis that you have to escape from the nightmare you've been put in. The graphics are great at selling the otherworldly atmosphere and the sound design is also super creepy. It uses both jump scares and atmosphere versus relying solely on jump scares, making it a winner in my book. My only real complaint is that sometimes the puzzles get to be too obtuse. Most of them are good brain teasers, but some require seriously out of the box thinking. A bit too much for my tastes.Still, the atmosphere and creativity at play here is great and worth checking out. Like I said, this is a game that is beter left unspoiled, which is why I've been so vague. With the cheap asking price, you could do a lot worse than this."

,Recommended,429720,21601861,"Posted: 3 March, 2016",all,skooch,"One of the only refreshingly unique horror games released in the last few yearsAnd that statement would hold true even for the precursor to this game, a free indie title released more than a year ago. IMSCARED has been a long time coming into its current incarnation into a full game,but it lives up to it's 5 dollar price tag just fine, and then some.It's hard to explain how good this game is without spoiling any of the experience, but here goes.The horror game genre is undoubtedly gimmicky and saturated like the film one, it's hard to find something that truly suprises a die-hard participant in the genre.IMSCARED is the one of a kind exception.Some may argue over the pixelated art style, the cliche ""meta"" gameplay, or even just the length of the title. But I disagree, it's these things and how well they're done that make this game truly shine.Where others have simply copied and combined aspects of previous works, Ivan (the developer of IMSCARED) has outdone himself to the point where this game simply excels at being, well, horrific. There is a moment in this game to scare everyone and give them the chills, not a single opportunity is wasted to let you know the situation you have gotten yourself into.IMSCARED doesn't get old, not in the sense that it has replay value, but it is true:once you complete this game in its entirety you will not look at any horror game the same way again.What this title does is excite you while unsettling the hell out of you for the entirety of the experience, from the start to the very end (oh, and I do mean very end, this game while technically short, feels like a lifetime to complete in the very best way possible).Suffice to say, buy this damn game already. I've never written any reviews for Steam before, but this game is the one I just had to. That should be all you need to know.Oh and just one last thing.Forgive me."
,Recommended,429720,30403675,Posted: 8 March,all,t. mike,"Not brilliant, but innovative as heck and worth it for all the experimentation it gets into. The game twists your expectations of gaming and kills itself -- literally quits out (often during spooky moments) -- in order to keep you from progressing. You have to wade through obscure YouTube videos and .txt files populating your desktop to try to unravel what's going on and unlock the next segment of the game.IMSCARED has three endings staggered by more gameplay and story. The story's nothing special, but it's interesting enough (and creepy enough) underneath the shattered 4th wall and quirky puzzles. The way this game progresses...it really feels like the game speaks to you and responds to your actions. Great stuff."

No, but I would say that for a pixelated horror game, this has a pleasantly eerie feel to it and would be a fun way to get your feet wet if you are interested in trying the horror games."

The fact that the game never communicates what you have to do to advance can sometimes create situations in which you're not sure if you should be looking around harder because you missed something, or if you should write a five page essay and submit it to the game. The fourth wall bits are interesting but poorly implemented for a cohesive horror experience.The story is weak and vague, the graphics have a nice style but make text illegible, and the jumpscares were mostly unnecessary. Some parts of the game rely on sound within a 3D soundscape, and sound seems to originate in one position but does not change relative to your movement. Certain actions like climbing a ladder or printing tickets have a gratingly loud volume for no reason.Many achievements were very arbitrary, and ended up being necessary to finish the game. Oh, and if you want to go back to get the achievements, have fun figuring out the ridiculous hallway hub. 2 doors go to 2 areas, one door with a pickup is needed to access a password screen to get to 2 other areas. It's as dumb as it sounds.IMGLAD that I didn't pay more than $4, which still seems too steep for the overall quality of this ""game,""  or waste more than 2 hours getting achievements to see the loud, lame ending. It's an experience, but one that I could have lived just fine without."

76561198033604792,Not Recommended,429720,29392538,Posted: 21 January,all,Meeg,"IAMSCARED is not like other games. It’s “meta” and it’s spooky. I can see how the designer was aiming to create a unique experience, and I commend him for this, but in the end I think he was only partially successful in the execution of his goal and in creating a game I wanted to play. I ended up just watching my friend play through most of it and if it was only me I would have given up before I finished.My thoughts (very mild spoilers ahead):* The meta-puzzles (puzzles which require you to look outside the game itself) are clever and out of the ordinary.* The more traditional puzzles are all pretty simple. The answer is usually obvious although sometimes you might have a hard time because of the game controls or because you can’t find something.* For the most part the game succeeds in creating an eerie atmosphere. The sound, the way the environment looks, the creepy messages and enigmatic characters….* As others have pointed out, part of the scare factor is a result of your annoyingly small field of vision. You can only see like five feet in front of you so it’s easy to run into something surprising.* Related to the limited field of vision, the game has a lot of jump scares. These are fun at first but get old fast, especially if you are caught by the monster and have to replay the same part again and again. This is frustrating; but more than that it can destroy the scare factor.* The controls! You need to use the WASD keys to move around (this alone is almost a deal breaker for me) and the game is not very responsive, so your movements are jerky. It’s also easy to get stuck in a corner or at the edge of a wall (this is  just a result of poor game design/programming). It’s particularly frustrating in parts where you’re being chased and need to run.*The graphics and the environment: I have mixed feelings. I see what the designer was going for with very basic, very retro graphics. The game’s look reminded me of EGA computer games and also the LSD: Dream Emulator on Playstation. So this gives the game a dream/nightmare vibe and it fits well with the “deconstructing the game” aspect of IAMSCARED. On the other hand, this really goes beyond artfully pixelated and sometimes just feels insufficiently detailed (get close enough to something and you’ll see it’s just colored blocks).* More than the graphics, I disliked the low level of interactivity. 90% of the objects you see (bookcases, cabinets, tables, shopping carts) are just decoration you can do nothing with. You’ll spend a lot of the game going up to things and trying to interact with them only to find out “nope.”*Related to the simple puzzles and the static non-interactive environment, there are a lot of times when it seemed like I reached a dead-end and needed to do something (like find a key or a secret passage or something) but the answer was that I needed to trigger something like a “cut scene” and then when I came back the way would be clear.*The story: again mixed feelings. In the game you’ll encounter one or two important characters. You’re given vague hints as to what their story is, but it’s left pretty fuzzy. On one hand, this is good because you need to fill in the blanks yourself and it’s open to interpretation. On the other hand, maybe there’s just not enough there.*That leads into my final gripe which is that there’s no pay off. Towards the very end, the game throws up such a barrier it’s almost like the designer doesn’t want you to finish the game. And the ending(s?) are kind of anti-climactic; it made me question whether it was even worth it.TL;DR: All-in-all, if I put aside the annoying controls, I’d say I got something out of IAMSCARED and enjoyed the unique meta-puzzles but so many things frustrated or bored me that I would never have finished the game on my own."

The atmosphere is menacing, the scares are terrifying, the music is creepy and fitting, and the ending is unforgettable.The antagonist messes with your head psychologically, then emotionally. You will feel very uncomfortable as you are forced to make heartless and horrible decisions, but this leads to one of the most bittersweet moments in gaming I have ever experienced.Some of the puzzles were very clever and fun, forcing you to think outside of the box in order to solve them in ways no other game has thought of. However, they aren't perfect. A couple puzzles were very tedious: the hedgemaze and the grammophone puzzles specifically. Without spoiling anything, these were a pain to get through and were the only sections that are actually detrimental to full experience.The game could use some more graphics options. Forcing the player to play in a lower resolution is archaic and creates a delay when having to alt+tab to the folder. There are also no FOV options or checkbox to turn off headbob. These two options would prevent a lot of simulation sickness for those that can get a little light-headed from first person view video games.That all being said, any fan of horror should definitely check this out.

It's one of those games that can be repetitive, but, in the end, it was worth it. There are some things I need to go over, however.If you haven't played the game yet, and you want to in the future, DO NOT READ THIS. IT CONTAINS SPOILERS.IMSCARED starts off where the Gamejolt verions also starts off. You have a folder thats created on the desktop, and that is where the documents are created when you are playing. I had no problems with the first section of the game. It was all familiar, and, so far, I was happy with the remake of IMSCARED. Although, some parts are different, such as the new sounds, better frames, and the video that pops up, I was still happy with the outcome.The second part, HER, is scary, to an extent. The start of this section is confusing, but, it plays just like the first part of the game. Once you go into the cellar, however, is when the game gets quite difficult. You have to figure out the code to unlock the gate so you can get the rope. After that, the entity HER begins to chase you. This part I found frustrating because you had to exit the game at a certain point, but the entity was very fast, but, at my 2nd try, I did it, but it may be frustrating to others. After you quit the game, you are able to use the rope to climb down the balcony. You are then greeted to a hedge maze. This part was VERY frustrating because of the ""mirror code"". You had to find pieces of a mirror to find the code, but, like all first person mazes, this one was confusing. I eventually found all pieces and the code, and exited the maze. After that, the train station. You have to destroy 3 gramaphones to get the metro key. I found this next part cool because you have to change the time to get the metro ticket instead of waiting. After you enter the metro, you have to ""face the truth"". This part was amazing.WARNING: MEGA SPOILERYou have to face against HER. You have to kill HER. But, the game won't let you have bullets for your gun. ""Six will do.""The next part was clever. After you enter the name, you are in the grocery store. You have to complete the to-do list. But, as you quit the game, you appear outside of the grocery store. After all of that, you have to get 3 valves in order to reveal a door. You need all achivements to enter this door, however. Once you enter the door, you have two options. Take the flower or end the game.In conclusion, IMSCARED is a good game, but can be repetitive. Some people may find this annoying, others won't. For me, I was okay with it. But, some of the jumpscares in the game are cheap, and that somewhat annoys me. I won't tell you where they are. ;)In the end, IMSCARED is a truly fascinating game, and you should give it a try."

I'm hoping that the creator makes more games like this.The only complaints I have is how much you have to replay/reset specific parts of the game so many times in order to get to where it is you want to go when you need achievements, and/or solving specific puzzles.And on the one ending where there's the floating white heart, I couldn't do anything to reset the game. I don't know if this is a glitch, or if it's part of the game, but I couldn't do anything. I was able to shrink the window down with the F4 key, but I couldn't do anything after that so I can reset it properly. So I had no choice but to 'control, alt, delete' in order to reset everything.Overall though, I would recommend this game for everything that happens.

I prefer either power-fantasy type deals (like Dynasty Warriors) or stuff that appeals to planning (like XCOM or Wasteland 2). I do particularly like the ever-rare metagame, though. The sort wot is like Hack n' Slash or The Magic Circle.As that particular type of game is super rare, when I found out that this game is also that, I jumped on it.As per usual with metagames, the less said about it the better.As for the horror bits from someone who *really* doesn't care about horror (and as such is woefully unqualified to tell anyone if horror is good or not), it was pretty good. At least a few of the jumpscares actually got me and the general mood of it is fairly spoopy. That wasn't my core engagement, though. I just wanted to know the next way the game would screw with me.Take this as a recommendation purely for the metagame.

Even on subsequent playthroughs, I sometimes still feel frightened at the game's antagonist.A word of advice: your antivirus will probably hate this, class game elements as false positives and probably make this game impossible to play or even install (like it did with me).
