,Not Recommended,429780,22691409,"Posted: 28 April, 2016",all,maso,"DisclaimerI just want to make it clear that this game is not like bunnyhopping on csgo, css, gmod etc...Edit for the mad kids who want to bring up quake/ older movement styles. This game is nothing like it. It's mechanics are based off the source engines bunny hop mechanics and is not similar in any way to quake trick maps, and even if it did, it failed miserably.To all the people who have said ""maybe they didn't want mechanics/the game to be the same as bunny hopping in source games""If they did, maybe they shouldn't sell it as ""right back to...when hopping, strafing and sliding were all the rage.""They should probably make it quite obvious that they are going to change the mechanics as the mechanics are what make bunnyhopping, well bunnyhopping.Don't sell your product as something that it isn't I reviewed this product coming off what they have specifically advertised it as a ""remastered"" ""all in one"" game made for bunnyhopping (with the inclusion of sliding). If that's not what they were going for, they should make it much more obvious that it is not, instead of literally selling it as it, I don't want people getting their hopes up and falling in the same trap as I did.IntroThis is coming from a very experienced bunny hopper, thousands of hours actually bunny hopping on source, csgo and gmod.Check my youtube if you want proof or whatever.Firstly, as a disclaimer, I am giving no credit to the looks of this game visually, it does look very good yes, however it's made in the unreal engine, pulling off visually appealing games is very simple due to the lighting in the engine and the high resolution textures in the engine already.Mechanics/Gameplay (most of the review and is very important.)Map DesignSound/Options Menu.Final ThoughtsMechanics/GameplayThis game is done in a very poor way, let me explain.Strafing in the source engine is done by sync, the way that it works in short is if you have a +left (mouse movement to the left tick) along with a +moveleft (left strafe tick) in the air, then you gain speed.This means that as long as you are doing this, you will gain speed and with autohop, when you land and jump again you will not lose this speed.This is the core basics to bunnyhopping in any source engine game.Bunny hop league is made in the unreal engine, and the mechanics are no way like the source engines'.Bunny hop league in its current state, when you strafe in the air while turning your mouse you gain speed, however you dont keep your speed.Also, its not based on sync either, it's literally the further you strafe, the faster you go, so if you wanted to go fast you have to do 180 degree turns just to go fast, and you have to keep up these strafes because you actually lose speed, until you go at the base movement speed.This completely kills the whole point of the game as you aren't able to keep your speed properly, nor does it replicate the original mechanics coming from the source engine.My point is, this game is actually awful in terms of making a game to replicate bunnyhop.It doesn't replicate the mechanics, only the maps which causes an awful experience to old players and new ones.Map Design*edited*A basic lesson you learn when remastering or creating a game of another is that you can't change the mechanics of a game, and keep the same map design, or vice versa.It just doesn't work, the maps design doesn't fit with the new mechanics at all.Due to the way you get acceleration with the new mechanics there is no way to go fast without it just being a difficult mess with overly wide strafes, you cannot skip blocks either when you go fast because as soon as you stop having big strafes you LOSE SPEED, so you cant actually keep the speed you made which is core to bunnyhopping in the way it is.So even if these mechanics were intended to be in the current state that they are, the maps that have been made for them are not appropriate at all, all the block spacing and placements are very strange and force you to have very small strafes, which with the mechanics of the game, make you go slow, so you are either going very slow constantly, or going fast and failing miserably or having a very awkward time doing 180 strafes.Additionaly, the blocks on the maps are almost all the same size all the time, it's almost like you did no research into bhop map making at all, difficulty scales really well with block size and you seemed to have just been blind to it the whole time, and with the mechanics of the game being off, it's really difficult to land on blocks that small.Finally, about map design, on a few of your maps you have areas where you have to travel up a vertical area using jump pads, these are so hard to do as an ex source player due to the mechanics just being so off.In these sections, you need to strafe a lot to keep your speed, this means doing mutiple 360s in the air and turning very fast.In source, doing this action and gaining speed is quite hard to pull off, but once mastered you can control your speed.In BHL, as I said before, the more you turn in the air, the more speed you gain, which ends up just making you go stupidly fast and its impossible to control, with the combination of this and the small blocks, these sections are actually hard as ♥♥♥♥, unless you throw all skill out the window and just dont strafe and ""W"" it, which isn't fun.Sound/Options Menu.""Firstly, No sound?At all?No sound effects at all?Even for the menus????""My exact words, when I booted this game up on my stream.I know this is early access, £2, but you shouldn't be allowed to sell a product, and expect things like this to not be critiqued, very dissapointing, you couldn't of just spend a day making placeholder sounds and putting them in before releasing the game?The menu options is even worse.You appeal to the competitive bunny hop community with the release of your game, you must of understood this, and with that, your controls options are completely empty apart from sensitivity, which is a SLIDER.People want to replicate their controls from the game you are taking from, give us a value please, not an ambiguous slider which doesnt give us any way to see how close/far away we are from the exact sensitivity we have been playing on for years.No movement bind changes too, please put basic expectancies in your game before releasing it as a sold product.Video options, got the basics down at least, resolution changes, graphics quality changes, gamma changes.Final ThoughtsThe game has a lot of potential, when I saw it, my first thought was ""Great, this could be the game that brings all the bunnyhop community together from csgo, source, gmod etc... and bring them to one game, and really iron out all the problems that the source engine has and make bunnyhopping great again""But this just isn't the way to do it honestly.You really have to perfect the way that source engine strafing works if you want people to take your game seriously.The game looks nice and the idea is amazing.Please research maps, there are so many amazing css maps, just spend an hour or two on gamebanana and check out and playtest maps, get some diversity, see how they play out, watch top level css players, get a feel for what high level play looks like, it will help you out so much.I want to love this game and I want it to have the potential to bring the bhop community together, but you really have to make some serious improvements, at this point it's not even worth the £2.00 to spend on the game."

,Not Recommended,429780,32745408,Posted: 24 June,all,♥DJ Charizard♥,"I loved bunnyhopping back when it was still popular in Counter Strike Source. Now CSS has been dead for years, and it's basically a dead gamemode. I had to look for a single player bhop game in order to fulfill my bhopping needs. While this game was great for fulfilling that need, this game needs a lot more added to it.This DOES NOT need DLC yet when the game is barely finished. There is no 3rd person view, no way to record demos or play them back, no key press indicator, no customization, and countless other features that are missing.Finish the game before you release DLC."
,Recommended,429780,22696646,"Posted: 28 April, 2016",all,pcpie,"Good idea to bring bunny hopping to a newer engine, but it needs a lot more work one on the strafing and the feel of the game before its fun to play. I don't think it should copy the strafe style from the source engine but rather make something new that still feels very nice to play if not better. imo it would be best to make something that encourages you to strafe smoothly rather than something where you just have to spam strafes in order to go fast.I would only recommend buying it at this time if you're curious about it and want to support the developer. I'm saying that mainly because of the lack of content, there's only 7 maps in the game right now plus a tutorial map. I think it would be a good idea to allow people to make custom maps and upload them for other people to play, even though the game is no where near to being finished i still think it would be a good idea, because i don't think it would cost much effort to do so and it would make the game a lot more interesting. I wouldn't say its worth buying right now if you're just playing it casually and are not interested in the development of it, but i'm sure it will become a very good game as time goes on."

Secondly you should be able to turn fast as ♥♥♥♥ and not lose so much speed, it's really irritating. Thirdly it seems like you have no weight at all just like you're floating forward.

This game with friends is great, espically if there good at bhopping. One  downside of the game is, the default FOV Is not to my liking, in the future i wish they will add FOV in the settings so i can set my FOV to further away so i can see more whilst bhopping. Another downside is, that there is no online leaderboard. A global and friends leaderboard would be great then you can see what times other people are getting on the same map."

Of course with a separate record for each style.-MapsSome maps have a lot that could be improved on, i have been making bhop maps for years and there are some minor things that improve gameplay of a map drastically, without harming visuals. I wont go into details however.-ModesIts nice to see that they recently added Sliding and Ramps. (Slide racing and Fly from css/csgo) They were pretty fun but were noticably still quite buggy in some areas but since they are new maps cant really complain.-Replays/SpectateAdd a way to rewatch the current fastest time on a server, and also add a replay locally as well. This will make people more likely to post videos of their runs because they wont have to be recording the entire time.Spectating is now working! however, i would of liked to see you able to watch the player in the ""First person"" Perspective, seeing their exactly as they see it.-Ramps/SlopesThis game features an element that isnt quite as easy to do in css/csgo. You can fly REALLY high extremely easily if you hit angles, this is both frustrating and fun at the same time. It has also allowed me to get out of bounds on some maps!All for now, i will update this if i ever feel the need."

,Recommended,429780,24716096,"Posted: 4 August, 2016",all,WLSN,"This game is amazing, for many reasons. The only way i can best describe this game, is that in concept it is very similar to 'Geometry Dash'. It was so clearly a copy of The Impossible Game, yet it so much better, with awesome effects, extra levels and so on. Bunny Hop League is clearly based on Counter Strike bunnyhopping, yet this game makes it so much more fun with, just like Geometry Dash, awesome effects, amazing graphics and awesome levels.If you are a noob to bunnyhopping, this game is certainly for you, as it takes you through levels stage by stage based on levels and teaches you how to strafe and go faster as you get further into the game.The soundtrack is awesome! It has some really neat electronic songs that add to the fun when you perfectly land a hop on the beat drop. I have already downloaded some of the songs, and will continue to listen to them everywhere i go.If you want to test the game out as a demo you can use this link that was posted by the creator of the game when it was in Greenlight:GAME DEMO"

,Recommended,429780,25074944,"Posted: 22 August, 2016",all,ActrimuS,"Before you read thorugh, I wanna point out, that i am gonna compare this game to the Bunnyhop Servers in Counter Strike: Source and Garry´s Mod since all other BHop communities are dead.Bunny Hop League is a pretty good game in it's actual state. In general I recommend it, but be aware that it will take you some time to learn the core mechanics of Bunny Hopping. If you are in the BHop scene, you can read further, because I think this game has to be updated at some point.The graphics are awesome, that's not my point. What annoys me about the game is the physical settings, since they are almost everything about the game.If you were BHopping in the early days of CS:S or GMod, you will notice a little difference to their enginge in comparison. There are 2 facts I wanna point out.1. The SpeedgainNot like in the source games, you can strafe 10 turnarounds per second, and still get as much speed, as you would get with 10 turns in 10 seconds. That is stupid. A hard part about BHop is to find the right balance between wide strafes and the perfect route. With extremely fast strafes you can gain very much speed in a redicilous time. This needs to be changed.2. DuckhoppingYes, you shouldn´t duckjump all the time, but if you have to do it ...It feels like in CS:GO BHop, when you duck while strafing, you will immediately lose velocity. Why? I don't even know.Beside of this, it dosn't feel exactly like Cs, but I'm ok with it. Now we need more maps, a multiplayer and a WR-Rankingsystem. Within 3-6 months this could be a real hit, Bunny Hopping is relaxing and enjoyable for almost everybody. Give it a try if you are intrested in any way. You don't waste any money - promise."

,Recommended,429780,32454028,Posted: 15 June,all,NightPr0wler,"Bunny Hop League is a game focusing on bhop, ramping and sliding. All 3 game modes are challenging, fun and there are a handful of maps to choose from. If you have played bhop in games like Counter Strike, you should know how it works.The controls are fluid and feels responsive enough to let you feel that you have the control you need to success. Bunny Hop League runs great on my PC and the FPS is always high. Remember to have ""raw mouse input"" off to get more frames.  Overall it's a fun game but it can be annoying sometimes. That's because when you bhop you feel very light instead of heavy as in Counter Strike bhop. You miss a lot of tiles since the lightness of your body makes it harder to calculate where you should land. The maps are well crafted where some are easy, some are hard and some are longer than other maps. The map design feels simple where it's easy to navigate the layout when you are jumping at full speed.NB this feels nothing like Counter Strike bhop, so don't expect that when you play the game. Sometimes you lose all momentum if you make a sudden strafe. It's hard to explain the movement, but you should practice how this game bhop before making a final thought. The game is cheap and the devs listens to the community where they for example fixes bugs and adds new free maps, as well as launches dlc's once in a while (they are also cheap).I have not played the multiplayer, but I've tried the sliding and ramping. These game modes works better than the bhop in my opinion. Both game modes are fast paced and the map layouts are hard to master. The devs should focus more on these game modes than the bhop since it is the weakest game mode for me. While the controls feels good, it's something with the movement that makes it unforgivable when you miss a tile you 100 % thought you were going to hit.I recommend the game because it's cheap, fun and gives you another view on bhop. The game gives the genre a fresh breath, but it is not as good as the bhop in Counter Strike."

One issue I have at the moment is that the ambience only plays when im moving, which is very annoying, and there's no way to turn it off. The bhop feels a bit better in this version. Also why do I slide off the black and white platforms in the ""pure"" map?Now for how you could probably improve this in the future. I reckon you could probably add something like a level editor so people can create levels to improve the longevity of the game. You could also probably add some form of multiplayer, or even just a chatroom function as a big thing that drew me towards bhop was the banter that happens in chat and over mic.Also, why is my fps capped at 60?EDIT: Another thing that happens a lot is sliding off of platforms or clipping the edges, what's up with that?"

The game is beautiful, has bhop and has some sick choons, all in all 10000/10 for me. you should definitely pick this game up.-cheers BigD"

You can actually take your time on maps without everyone rtv'ing because they can't finish the map.The only problem is visibility. On some maps lighting is too bright, but too dark on others. Also there is a low amount of maps, but I think this could be improved by having steam workshop creator.

,Recommended,429780,23437363,"Posted: 7 June, 2016",all,meme merchant,"First of all, I really enjoy B-Hop. It's the reason I bought the game in the first place. I knew it wouldn't be that great for €3,- but still decided to give it a try.Stumbled on the following things that should be applied or changed.* Level design. Levels are kind of short and boring and there's almost no skill curve in Easy compared to Hard maps. Only that blocks are more seperate from eachother.* Air acceleration. The air acceleration in the game is pretty damn low and doesn't allow you to make sharp turns in mid air. However there is enough to make you go faster. Synchronized strafing doesn't really reward you in speed.* Keybinds. The fact that you can't bind keys to a certain action and you're bound to a certain set of keys for example space to jump. Ctrl to crouch, etc. Developers are working on this.* Jagged block edges. Every bhop or xc block has a slight radius on its edges. Landing on the edge of a block basically makes you fall of or lose all of your speed. Fix this please.* No console.Despite all this I recommend this game. If you love bhop you will like it and it will hopefully improve in the future."

,Recommended,429780,24700407,"Posted: 3 August, 2016",all,Gravity,"Bunny Hop League is a game that takes the core aspect of Bunny Hopping from games such as Counter Strike, Unreal Tournament, Quake, and others. It is run on the Unreal Engine 4. The game takes the Bunny Hopping aspect and then makes it much more smooth, and simplistic. No matter which game and engine you are used to Bunny Hopping on, you will get a hold of this in under 10 minutes. At the time of writing this review, Bunny Hop League is $3.99 (USD) and is in Early Access. The early access includes several maps featuring climbing, sliding and bunny hopping. It has been confirmed the finished release will feature a different price tag than the early release price, So if you want it.. Pick it up now. It will most likely be a $10-20 game. Multiplayer is confirmed for the future. It is confirmed to be featured when the full release, is released or possbily sooner. I have a few reccomendations for the devlopers so here they are:- Add a sync counter- Graphics customization truely lacks (Needs stuff like: Model detail, lighting detail, texture detail, anti-aliasing, etc.)- Currently Very Low - Low graphics are basically unplayable with, You cannot see a single thing. Everything is pixelated and blurry.- Add the ability to make custom maps and share them on the workshop.- It would be cool to see hands with gloves and as you jump the hands move as if real life. Kind of like Mirrors Edge.- The ability to both customize and remove the crosshair.- The ability to noclip into the map to see it out.- Command console, incase one might be interested in using cheats in Single Player (Such as noclip), or tweaking for fps.- Needs a little bit of better optimization- FOV adjustment- The music does lack in variety, would be cool if we could link our Spotify accounts and select a playlist or radio.- A spectator mode (Not to be confused with Multiplayer). Friends can join in like a lobby and spectate you and communicate together through a voice chat and text chat. (Voice chat should be allowed to disable from both the spectators end and the players end. Same with text chat.)_______________________________________________________________________Of course this is only Early Access at the current moment, but I would appreciate it if you at least considered these suggestions as a possible feature. These of course as noted are my personal opinions and suggestions and should be thought of as so.------------------------------------------If you are interested in contacting me you can do so by following and Tweeting to me on:Twitter: @CSGOgravity- Sincerly, Gravity"

,Not Recommended,429780,31553720,Posted: 4 May,all,pallinkarvarusetti,"TL;DR:Pros:- I didn't find anyCons:- A lot of bugs- Cheap graphics- CS bhopping copy with worse physics- Annoying soundtrack0/5. Don't buy.Longer explanation:I have played various trickjumping games and mofidications since 2003, and so far this game has to be one of the worst of them. I encountered so many bugs in the game within the first 5 minutes already, that any sort of early access or beta in the name wouldn't justify for the amount of bugs.First, I went through the tutorial which is not even worth being called a tutorial, as it only tells you to press jump and has horrible ""jokes"" by the narrator. After that, I tried to play the first actual map, only to respawn inside the floor and not being able to press any button in game any longer, had to ctrl+ald+del and close the game.Once I restarted the game, it was in windowed mode and no matter what I tried, I couldn't get it back to fullscreen. I went through the options several times, restarted and minimized in between, but no change. Windowed forever.I proceeded then to continue playing, only to notice that if you change any settings and go into playing a map, and come back to menu, the settings are unsaved. I didn't notice any ""apply changes"" button anywhere, so I assume it takes changes in use right away, as it seemed to do ...sometimes. I tried to mess around for a few minutes to get my desired settings, only to lose my nerves after some of the settings reset magically and some not.Settings aside, I finally went to play the maps and test the gameplay functions, only to be disappointed yet again. The gameplay didn't offer anything new, in fact it's like playing bhop in CS:GO, except worse. The jump is higher, game didn't seem to register mouse movement as sharply as I moved the mouse, and the maps are just plain bad and boring.Now for the part that has fooled most people into buying this game; Graphics. I didn't play through all the maps, but from the ones I did play, I noticed the game relies heavily in the use of reflecting surfaces. The actual structural work in the maps is extremely plain and empty, making the graphics very cheap. Also there are shootable targets that open doors, but once you shoot there's no sound or anything visual showing that you actually shot, which makes it very confusing to know did you actually hit your target or not. They could've at least made level-wise sounds for the doors or some beep noise for the targets when hit, but I guess they were just too lazy.Soundtrack choice is also kinda mediocre FL Studio crap, mostly very annoying. Oh, and beware when you start the game, all the sounds are to the max and your ears will explode.CONCLUSION: I wouldn't play this game even if it was free. Refunding right after I'm done writing this review. There are multiple better choices of games, even free ones, to go for. 0/5."

The strafing is similar to that of CSGO 128 tick bhop where you will just spam your keys alot instead of going for smooth back and forth strafes. Next, the prespeed in spawn... This is awful and I have no idea why you would include this. I would much rather like seeing a system similar to prestrafe or just keeping 450 as the max speed in spawn. One of my favorite parts of this whole game was the part of jumping up slopes boosting you into the air. It is similar to jumping in Quake where whenever you land on a slope going into it you get boosted up instead of surfing it such as in CS. I spent about an hour alone routing the map cobble with the slopes at the lava part. Majority of these maps are boring short maps that dont give much to do once you get bored of certain ones. I would really like to see a level editor for the community to work on maps because this game has less than 20 maps i believe whereas other games for bhop have thousands. Also don't like the fact that their is not bots / way to remove hud for better recording runs. I would reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys bhopping just because the slopes add a brand new way to route maps whereas normally you would just bhop through and is very interesting. If you want to be safe though and not spend your money I would wait to see what the game looks like out of Early Access. TL;DR: Strafing is like 128 tick in csgo, jumping feels like quake, not very much content, can prespeed with bhops in spawn :/, no bots for saving times, and"

First of all, the motion blur. There needs to be options to make the motion blur go away, because it creates lag for those who dont have good computers. Second, strafing in the game feels off. It just feels slow. Plus there needs to be options to change the key binds for the game. (i did see something about this inside the game in options, which i think means that they will make options for this available in the future but it needs to be addressed.) And the crouching is a little strange as well. All in all the game isnt bad, just needs a few tweaks and it should be good."

This game has alot of maps for a early access game, and more to come in the future. The devs, (btw their are only two), are very kind and I can tell this is a early access game that will grow into even better game than it is right now. The range of maps atm are huge, from small easy starter levels to large difficult levels. So no matter what your current skill level you will always have a fun filled challenge for whatever map you play. I kept finding myself at midnight trying to do skips that I created and it is the most satisfying feeling when you finally get your skip down pat. The only ""bad"" part about the game is currently there is no ingame music so it can be quiet, I just play some of my favorite music to fill in the silents. Also the game is slightly buggy with some odd triggers here and their but as a Beta Tester I can tell you that they are listiening and they are working hard to fix any bugs with the game.

The movement is very smooth, you are able to pick up speed very fast, and the maps are all challenging yet extremely fun to play.However, there are a few game breaking bugs that I have experienced which need to be fixed as soon as possible.I am running a duel monitor display, and so when I play the game my mouse always ends up moving to my second monitor as it never locks in the game (even fullscreen mode doesn't help). From this one bug alone it seems like some other ones develop. There are times where I can be playing at 200fps but every five to ten seconds my games frame rate will drop to 50-60 and then go back up. Because of this I have failed many runs. I have also found that just as I experience frame rate drops every couple of seconds, I also experience mouse lag every couple of seconds as well. I could be doing a map and every couple of seconds my mouse will lag almost as if the sensitivity had been turned down to the bare minimum.This game is obviously still early access so these bugs are normal however, this really needs to be fixed soon as this game (for me at least) is at a point where it's almost unplayable."

,Recommended,429780,25488205,"Posted: 12 September, 2016",all,damn daniel,"TL;DR: This game does not handle exactly like bhopping in CSS/CSGO/TF2/Gmod, but once you get used to it you may find it feels a lot smoother and nicer.Full Review:I'm a bhop fan and have been for a while now, I've played at least 150 hours of bhop on TF2 and made over a dozen maps.In the very beginning I didn't really care much for this game, I only stayed because the graphics were neat. Then I started playing more, then more updates came.Now that 1.0 is out, this game is very, very fun in my eyes. I can't even bhop in TF2 anymore because I've gotten so used to how bhopping feels in this game, and it feels great if you ask me. Sure, occasionally you'll miss a platform you'd swear you'd hit in Source, and occasionally you'll narrowly make it to a platform that you'd never make in a million years in Source, but if you look through that and learn to work with it, then it makes for a very impressive display of what a few developers passionate about a movement mod can create.There are currently 30 maps as of the writing of this review. Overall, the maps are what I'd call ""Pretty good"", with a lot of very excellent, good looking, good flowing maps, and a handful of awful maps. However, I don't feel any one map is too awful to simply not play, even maps that I find extremely frustrating and poorly built such as Generic are still worth running from time to time in my eyes, if anything they'll only teach you more. But when you focus on the best maps, such as Cobble and Zen, you'll start to see that this game has a lot of excellent maps to offer that you just can't get anywhere else in the Bhopping community.Physics-wise, I'd say that the devs have made this game mimic the Source engine about 80%, there are a couple of exceptions such as the fact that surfing doesn't really work very well unless you're constantly moving downwards along ramps, and bhopping on upwards-facing slopes will gain you a lot of height but not in the same way that it does in Source games. Regardless of these physics differences, after a few hours of play I can confidently say that I am now used to the physics and can run maps fast and without failing due to anything but my own mistakes.With more maps to come, further improvements, and developers that actively listen to the community, this game is currently a shining Gem in Steam's under $10 game pool and with just a little more work and help from the community, it could grow into something phenomenal and likely find a huge following in the future.Stop reading, start hopping, at just $6 the price tag is well worth it."

,Recommended,429780,34870032,Posted: 10 September,all,Heero22,"To start this off, im not familiar with CS/Source engine bunny hopping, I personally prefer Quake 3 or the CPMA varient of it, so atleast from a technical standpoint i dont know the subtlties enough to really claim if the bunny hopping itself is bad, though the ability to stop mid-air just by hitting back, is something I find to be troublesome.The good things about this game is that its sole purpose is for bunny hopping, i personally would like to see more games with this concept in mind to come out in the future. Graphically looks good, and aesthetically diverse, though could use more character models and the player shadow lags behind the player. It runs pretty well and is well optimized.The meh thing is the music, it honestly just sounds like the same old retired music found in the background of every vlog, and not having the option to turn it off (only a volume slider), or import your own music certainly doesnt help.The bad things really come down to the details and the lack of a Steam Workshop. As I said before just hitting backwards to try to slow down takes you to a complete stop, forcing you to miss platforms constantly. Another thing is the mouse sensitivity, while it has enough room for my radius of 20cm/ 360 at 1600 dpi, there isnt much more room to go beyond further than that. Having the same number scale as Source would be better for those coming from said game so they can get their radiai's to match what they play at.Theres alot here that can be expanded upon, assuming the devs put in the work, or let the community drive partial creativity. It would be a shame if a game like this couldnt be made again just because this one fails at certain points.Tbh I'm not sure how well I can reccomend this game, if you already play bhopping servers on games like CSS or CSGO, then dont get it, but if you dont have those games but want a bunnyhop like experience, then this may be for you."
