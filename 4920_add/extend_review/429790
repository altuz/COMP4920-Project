,Not Recommended,429790,29457176,Posted: 23 January,all,(Geo) JesusHatesGeo,"In its current state, I can't reccommend it unless you want to take part in the direction of the game. It's painfully obvious that it isn't complete, but no one acts like it is. It's like trying to get a baby to work heavy machinery. It can be fun at times, but for the most part, it doesn't really work. You might go to attack a skeleton that looks like something out of a nintendo 64 game with less polygons and then you target it and can't attack, then walk away, only to have a slew of damage numbers fill the screen and kill you from a hundred yards away from the skeleton. Then the revive button won't work.One thing, however, is that, from what I've played, it's MUCH less pay to win than other  mmorpgs, which is nice, it's actually free, the in-app purchases feel more like donations with exclusive perks than something you HAVE to get in order to play the game without hundreds of hours of grinding.So with all that being said, I look forward to this being a damn fine game someday. That day is not today. Or tomorrow. It'll be a while."

If you've never heard of this dev and somehow stumbled upon this with its currently ""mixed"" overall reviews status, I recommend checking out Artix Entertainment'sAdventure Quest Worlds. That is what I can forsee the game becoming. Which is essentially a decent immersive story were it not for the constant grinds and microtransactions.For AE fans, you can be sure to check back regularly for AE's latest creation sculpted identically to every other game they've made, but now it's in 3D."

(you can however use Reshade-https://reshade.me/-, and tone down the saturation, add in some better FXAA, add better bloom, and add some sharpening.)Compared to other AE games, this one seems promising, but will need some good content to really convince me its a game worth sticking with. as of now, it has seemed pretty one dimensional, however that is expected, as the devs work through making their first 3D game. promising concept guys, just follow through :D"
,Recommended,429790,29885940,Posted: 12 February,all,Saiko Rogue,This game is fun if you actually try and make friends that will help you grind. Ashfall and other updates may make this game better but for now keep in mind that this game is early access and still needs developement. Playing this game alone or solo of course makes it boring. I recommend this game for people who like to socialize.

I recommend having good internet connection to be able to play this game smoothly without any problem (500kbps is enough)Overall this game worth to download, worth to play, worth to buy and get support but not worth for 4 years of waiting I expect more from AE than this weird control game*This review is pure my opinion, I'm trying my best to explain my experience playing this game"

,Not Recommended,429790,29575132,Posted: 29 January,all,Legally Blind,"This is a game where I find it is pretty okay,but has so many problems holding it back,partly due to it being early access.I'll start with the cons since they are the more important things at this time in develpoment.Cons:The way you get quests atm is basically enter an area you get one or a few(Atleast the first quest in the area.)The quests that have you deliver things to other npcs don't have you talk to said npc.There are quite a few quests like that as well at the first area of the game out of Battleon.Lots of grinding that will turn most people away from the game.Not as many cutscenes as I like,but I am fairly sure they will make more when the game becomes more developed.Combat is fairly laggy and you will not see most animations for it.The start of the game is fairly hard for the warriors atleast(IMO as you will take heaps of damage from mobs)No current mapBad inventory system(needs sorting options)No party or guild system(But,atleast you can cooperate in killing for exp and loot)Only one character slot(Pretty sure on this,but I may be wrong.)No difference in skills so your apparently stuck with the skills your class begins with.That will basically cover the cons I think now the pros.Pros:I love the comedy of Adventurequest and I would love to see a whole mmorpg with it(I don't count AQWorlds)The art style fits the adventurequest feel(IMO)The new zard styles are amazing(and I just want more types of zards like in AQ I am only in the first area still so may already be there.)The designs of the other mobs are pretty good and have improved on the previous renditions of AQ.I would say this is a game with a lot of promise it just needs to sort some issues and balance out the grindfest that it is now if it seeks a lot of players."

,Recommended,429790,29798391,Posted: 9 February,all,Eric,"Adventure Quest 3D is basically like Adventure Quest Worlds put in 3D. The game is pretty much what you would expect from a Beta game. It is missing many cool features that were in AQW. For example you can't upgrade armor, meaning if you got a low level armor that you prefer more than some of the high level ones whoop de doo. I have completed all of the available quests for now and I'll be honest it took me 40 hours to get to level 15 with massive grinding. Storyline is decent so far and the classes in the game are also cool. I didn't understand one thing though you get to pick a class at the beginning, but it doesn't matter which one you take cause you can swap classes on the go, basically like Runescape at that aspect. Overall a fun game to play for some time at least and Multiplatform so far works great."

I sometimes went back to the browser AQ worlds to just check out what has changed since I was a kid and I saw a small teaser for 3D AQ worlds.I went in having low expectations and they were met fairly wellIf you have low expectations from this dont worry!  Its fun!  You just have to like the world and lore and that compensates for lack of depth.Another Con for this is that you can download it onto your smartphone and play right where you left off at.  If you are new to the series...dont waste your time here.  If you wanna free to play experience look elsewhere

,Recommended,429790,29415417,Posted: 21 January,all,Mr.ShiShi,"The game has a lot to go and huge shoes to fill. I think it to be the nature of MMOs that each one is compared to others, be it WoW or AQW. The game honestly needs a lot of fixing, refining, and overall polish.In my time currently in AQ3D (20.2 hrs) here are a list of grips I've had:-Out of combat healing feels slow-The lack of a healing button/animation makes it feel like your time resting is unproductive-Enemies aggro for far too long of a distance-A glitch where you fall through the floor is common in dungeons and on respawn, the glitch continues (needs /unstuck)-No sprint button-No version of enchanting-Finishing a zone has no real indicator beyond no more quests from the quest vendors-A lack of an overarching storyline (Not  a huge grip given that it is in open beta)-Moving with the forward key while turing the camera still means your character moves in the original camera's foward-Instances of areas exist but aren't stated, nor can you join a yulgar-9999 type of instance to meet up with friends, meaning if you have a large group, meeting up in one area is hellish ( /join graveyard(party) would be stellar-The barbershop costs 500 gold however you can't rotate your character model to see the back of the hair (female characters are especially a victim to this)-Quests with random drop requirements do not drop the same for every player, meaning if you're doing a quest that requires a box that has a 20% drop with a friend, you may finish ahead and need to wait for your friend-Sound is incredibly lacking-Some items don't have descriptions, which is disappointing-Inventory is not sorted by item type but by order obtained-Mana gain in combat is laughably unnoticable-Eye color choice would be nice, a choice from the entire color pallet would be great-CC gear would be nice-Hide helmet, cape, pauldron, etc would be greatSo in short, there are many flaws with the game. However, as with AQW if you think you may get into it, it's best to start now. It's an investment, a promise that when the game gets good (which I do believe it will) you'll have been there from a very early point, meaning you have very rare items (at least by AQW standards, in which the older, the rarer)."

76561198037217187,Recommended,429790,29657976,Posted: 2 February,all,Shadow33,feels like an early access alpha/beta game but with AQW added and  in 3d. Of course there is bugs but thats execpted with early access games in general. Plus the developers are not soom noobs so they can turn this into a great game given time and people's interest. just keep in mind this is early access and dont hold the tourch as high as Ark or AQW to begin with. look for potental and not reasons to hate this game.
,Recommended,429790,30023192,Posted: 18 February,all,Bulletproof,"You'll probably only like this game if you enjoyed AQW.The EXP curve is terrible, even if it's supposed to compensate for the low level cap. You'll get to the point where if you want to level up, you'll have to grind certain dungeons a bunch of times, not to mention that they give far less EXP than story missions (which you probably can't do if you are grinding the dungeons for EXP in the first place).The graphics are nice, with it being capped at 60 fps. Everything has good brightness (loving me that bloom). I'm also glad that there's actually sound effects in this game. That spawn-in sound effect is kind of annoying, though.Now, the controls  are a bit wonky. Realistically, no one is going to be comfortable with strafing their character and turning WITH THE SAME HAND. You can control the camera with the mouse, but doing so while moving just makes the camera snap back to its original position, making it a pain to use in combat. Controls would be fine if that was fixed."
