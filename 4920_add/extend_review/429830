I hope more developers explore and incorporate the redirected walking concept, because it could be a great alternative to the commonly used teleportation mechanic. I will say that the game is very very very short, but well worth it for $3- I will be showing it to all of my friends."

Each playthrough is short and take about 5-10 minutes to complete but the randomly generated obstacles keep the game fresh each time you play it. The cherry on top for this game is that it's not only fun to play it; it's fun to watch others play it too!One warning for people looking to purchase this game is that it does require a large play area (4m x 3m / 12ft x 9ft) and you will be crawling around a lot. Due to that this game is best suited for people with large play areas free of any obstruction. That's not to say you can't play it with a smaller space (I'm able to play with a space of 3.5m x 2m) the issue is that you'll have to cheat a bit to get past certain areas."

If you nearly meet the area requirements like me (about 3.8mX3.8m) , you should give it a go - I didn't seem to have any issues with the game itself (Vive tracking can be annoying though, if you don't have the base stations perfectly set up).  Gets repetitive.  If the devs continued to flesh this out it could be one hell of a game, but in the mean time, it's great for what it is.  Funny to watch your friends crawl around on the floor."
,Recommended,429830,26524197,"Posted: 10 November, 2016",all,Shubert,"One of my favorite VR games by far. Procedurally generated, so even though it's pretty short (you can beat it in about 10-15 minutes) there's actually a lot of replayability and variety to it. After playing through it several times, I can honestly say each session was pretty unique (even though they always start and end the same) and more importantly I had fun every time.The best part of course and what sets it apart from the rest of the VR market right now, is that there's no teleporting or any other type of virtual movement, you literally just walk/tip toe/crawl around your play space (which needs to be quite large, those with small rooms are out of luck unfortunately.)As far as gameplay, think Mission Impossible. Your job is to sneak past lasers, crawl through air ducts, find key cards and push buttons, making your way to the control room, where you must hack/blog the internet back into existence, or all the cat memes will be lost forever.Even though it's so short, I think it's absolutely worth the asking price as there's really nothing else on the VR market quite like it and it does a VERY good job of using your space and making you feel like you're really moving around a much bigger area."

Instead of teleporting all over the place, you walk in circles in your play area, but you don't feel like you're walking in circles. You feel like you're crawling through vents, opening doors, and dashing through a large building. I recorded myself while I played through the game, and it blew my mind how I had just been going in circles. Brilliant use of room scale. Well worth the $3. While there isn't much replayability, it's worth the $3 just to get your mind blown and show your friends how cool VR is. This is a must play for ANYONE with a 4m x 3m play area!"

It's a simple and exciting premise that's explored to its fullest. It will suck you in! No teleporting, no controller movement, you walk, crawl, jump, shimmy, and twist your way through the entire game! You're some kind of spy-astronaut-hacker on the volcano-moon-warehouse (don't question it) and you have to get through this crazy obstacle course of meandering hallways to rescue the internet (like I said, don't question it).You don't realize how much the roomspace grid impacts how you percieve VR until Unseen Diplomacy throws the grid out the window and erases the last vissage of actual reality.  You'll get lost in this goofy world, the only downside is you'll be back to actually reality in less than 20 minutes, it's a pretty short game. (But free, so a good way to spend your time.) It's a fair bit more than just a gawking simulator, since you get to mess around with switches, keyboards, and locks, but the gameplay isn't difficult or complex. This makes it an excellent game to show off to VR novices; I'll keep this one installed for just that, basically forever."

NOW the big thing that the dev could do that would be FREAKIN awesome is make something like this but like the Halloween horror houses of universal studios or 'Spooktober' where in real life you go from room to room in a haunted ""asylum"" and in each room you are  confronted with different horrors that make you edge closely to the wall until you can get to the next room.

You start off busting out of a box then sneak your way through an empty facility, finding key cards, tip-toeing along narrow ledges, dodging laser beams and crawling through vents. Using some very clever passageways, doors and lifts it makes you believe you've sneaked your way through a large facility all while never leaving the chaperone play area. Finishes up with a minigame where, if successful, you appear to upload cat pics to the internet... I'm sure they could have dreamt up a more worthy MacGuffin.Another short proof of concept but a good one and only 2 quid (UK).The game is smart enough to keep you in the chaperone area so set it to developer level and turn the camera off.

I love that the rooms are randomly generated so it is not the same pathway every time as well.

I hope these guys and other teams take more advantage of this kind of idea and continue with it.If you have played Antichamber, I think a mashup between these two games would be the best thing ever. Walk around a corner to find something different. Walk back, and it also is different? Yes Please! Getting lost in a 4x3m area sounds so cool.I see many people don't have 4x3m, but honestly it couldn't really get too much smaller. Maybe if they added a teleport for people with too small of rooms - but I'm 100% sure that would really break the core feeling of this game. Maybe if you didn't let people freely teleport, but only swap sides of the rooms (split the rooms in half and you can go from one side to another, but only once you reach the edge), or something. My idea would be to make sure the human player still walks/crawls the same distance no matter the size of their play space. With smaller play spaces, they just have to double back. That might be really really weird though."

Even though I knew it was going to 'use clever tricks' to make me forget I was just going round and round a 4mx4m square, I soon forgot that once I started playing. I was continually amazed at how the game would extend a path in front of me and I'd think 'no I can't go that way, I must be near a wall' and yet I could.I particularly recommend this game for newcomers to VR. I have found that room-scale + artificial locomotion (such as teleporting in the Vesper Peak portion of The Lab) can easily lead to damaged walls and damaged controllers. But the approach taken in Unseen Diplomacy, to modify the game world so that the player never has to reach the bounds, is superb.Highly recommended. Heaps of fun. Just wish there was more!"

,Recommended,429830,22711867,"Posted: 29 April, 2016",all,"Communist ""Joseph Ballin"" Layton","Unseen Diplomacy is kind of a rare game, because it requires one of the largest possible VR room sizes to play. The actual game is only about 8 minutes long by my average, and it's priced accordingly, but it seems to randomize itself each time you play with a few different variables for the room layout. The game is fairly simple and mostly just involves navigating through a few rooms that might have lasers or make you crawl through vents until you reach the end room, so it's fairly simple, but it's made interesting because it's one of the few VR games where you never have to teleport or use a trackpad to move around; you just walk through the whole thing. The only problem is that it doesn't tell you that it randomizes itself, so if you only play it once you might end up in a game that's almost nothing but crawling through vents and get a less interesting experience, but the randomization also seems like it would make it a good game to show a group, since each person can play it in a short time and get a different scene."

The use of your playspace as the actual movement through the game instead of teleporting etc is great. If you have a decent sized playspace then this game is a whole lot of fun.You can have timed runs to compete against your friends so great for a vive party game.

I like that the game is always pretty short so you can have multiple people try it in a party situation.

DO NOT underestimate this. Even slightly too small is the difference between having a good time or having a bad time.This game has many positive elements, and I had a lot of fun playing (while I could). You do need a ridiculously large playing area though. While mine is quite large, important elements were just out of my reach...making the game ultimately infuriating. In some cases the placement of an object necessary for advancement in the game need not be placed where it was. For example, in a room with a wall full of drawers, the key was hidden in the furthest corner drawer outside my playing area. It could have been hidden in any one of about 20 drawers, but it was in the one corner I couldn't reach. I'm no programmer, but I imagine that this particular instance would be a relatively simple fix to place the key in a middle drawer. Sometimes a necessary tool would roll just outside the space and I couldn't retrieve it.  Perhaps a room reset upon exiting and reentering could help with this.This game while simple, has a relatively large amount of replayability with a few simple changes each round to increase the difficulty. Crawling around moving lazers is quite simply, awesome! During the times when I was free to move around my space without risk of punching my walls, I had a blast. At those moments, the immersion into the game world was extrememly well done.In general, the inability to accomodate to even a slightly smaller than ideal playing space detracts from the overall experience and I cannot in good conscience recommend this game outright. However, I am extremely hopeful that some improvements can be made to make the game a bit more accessible (to those of us without a whole room in our house dedicated to VR). Then I would happily recommend this game."

It uses a very clever trick to give the impression of navigating a large space, it's well executed, and it's the game that you will show your friends to give a glimpse of what's to come... eventually.Apart from that, it's not much of a game - it has no narrative, it's procedurally generated, it has no particular 'end game' or replay value once the novelty wears off. I give it a negative recommendation on the basis that it's more of an experience than anything else, and being out of early access I can't really see how this will develop into something more."

It's also a real workout (unless you turn on a special mode for people who can't move so well) when you crawl through airvents (by actually getting on your knees and crawling for real) or avoid laser beams (by actually dodging them). Great party game, too, since it doesn't take long to complete and each run the facility layout is randomized! :)At less than 3 €, there really is no reason not to buy this as long as you have a big enough playspace.
