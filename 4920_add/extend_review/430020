,Not Recommended,430020,25035006,"Posted: 20 August, 2016",all,Faudraline,"Carrying the banner of Alawar Games - a Russian casual game publisher with decent enough accomplishments -Dance of Deathis Eight Game Studio's only game so far, and it's a somewhat alright HOG with a particularly disturbing Satanic atmosphere. It's one of those within the genre that you can either do with or without.It is near the turn of 19th century presumably, and a young boy named Luciano Folgeri has disappeared from the Saint Vicarius Orphanage in Venice! Baffled and scared by the happenstance, the director of the orphanage calls for a detective to investigate. His testimony declares that since Luciano's disappearance, the orphanage became haunted and there must be black magic involved in this particular case! Not yet convinced - however wrong we may end up within 2 hours - we begin our investigation and run gallantly to the boy's rescue.The display is certainly arranged with some elaboration, including the art works and puzzle displays with dark Renaissance themes; yet the stop-motion video acting is terribly exaggerated to a degree of annoyance. Even though artworks were mostly well-made, it all felt a bit forced with the exceeding amount of Satanic anecdote stuffed into the game at every turn. A medieval plague doctor masked villain here, a creepy goat skull there; a truck load of ghosts appearing to drop cues everywhere, and a forsaken mansion ridden with ritual sacrifices, satanic offerings and oaths sworn to the Devil. Okay, we got that the Biblical Evil was involved in this story. Get done with already! If you like your Liszt and Paganini, you have an appealing game music going for you though, which is nice.HOG scenes, while various, are not really challenging and HOG interfaces are badly collaged stock pictures to make the gameplay intentionally hard - to a failure. Without any achievements we need to worry about, you'll soon find yourself abusing the clue button. Puzzles are another story though. They are really creative and challenging with even artistic value in their display. That certainly makes this game a balanced ""meh"", not a direct ""not recommended"". Still... not enough to actually recommend it.At the end of the day, It is a really short and somewhat creepy HOG - I'm giving 2,5 hours at tops to go through clean - for 4 dollars. If you are curious, that price is an exaggeration. Wait for a decent sale and spare some time for it, only to forget about it just after.

,Recommended,430020,20347122,"Posted: 6 January, 2016",all,signalstation,"Cons: Very short (2-3 hours at most); clumsy navigation; unclear puzzle instructions.Pros: Nice art; a few uncommon puzzle types.Worth the sale price of $1.99, but hard to recommend at a higher price.Note: Do not download a walkthrough for this game. Sites that claim you can ""download"" a walkthrough for this game have infected players' computers with viruses. If a reputable site has a walkthrough, it won't ask you to download it, it will just display it.Full review: This hidden object game starts out very cheesy and below average, overall. There are a few silly attempts at jump scares, and very simple puzzles and HO scenes. The story is typical, and the occult elements are hilarious, to be honest (the villain's shoes have hooves for heels and pentagrams on the buckles!) The navigation is confusing at times and the instructions for a couple of the puzzles are hard to understand.As it goes on, however, there are a few special ""Golden Mask"" puzzles which play on music & death themes, and those puzzles are interesting and nicely designed. For example, one has you put together portraits of classical musicians and match the portraits with their death masks. Another has you match the skulls of animals to their original bodies. I enjoyed those puzzles and wished there were more. Also, the later hidden object scenes have morphing objects, moving parts, and interactions, making them a bit more interesting than the usual HO stuff.It is a VERY short game, though. So although it gets better, by the usual value estimate of $1=1 hour of gameplay, this is a $2-3 game at most."
76561198141404871,Recommended,430020,20014658,"Posted: 27 December, 2015",all,joan4003,"Storyline:  Place: Venice, Italy (or somewhere that seems like it). A boy, Luciano Folgeri, was kidnapped from St. Vicarius orphanage.  The gamer plays as a detective who is investigating this case.Simple enough storyline, find out about the boy, who stole the boy, where the boy was taken, rescue the boy and why this happened.Not quite sure why this game has an age lock on it.  Kidnapping, possibly.  The supernatural/ black magic elements maybe? (Though practically every game with magic, real or imagined, has a dark wizard/mage or some other dark entity in it.) A singular reference to God?I would get into spoiler territory if I continued about the storyline and just what is the ""Dance of Death"".  Though I will note the voice synching is off, possibly my computer, but if not my computer, not overly sure it is intentional or not.Gameplay: Mostly hidden object but with a nearly equal share of point and click.  There are basically two locations, subdivided into areas.  There is a list of objectives for each location that need to be completed.  There is no map or fast travel, it is not needed.  The hidden object scenes are lists, and some ""find x amount"".  The straight lists include extra locations or some interaction.  There are interactive lists, and they are very interactive, many are puzzles all by themselves. (I like them.  Reminds me of the Mystery Case Files master puzzles starting with Ravenhearst.)  And something different:  Morphing finds, or find x amount of morphing objects. (These are not as hard as they seem.  But if stuck hit the hint button.)  Note: look carefully around every scene especially the edges for extra places and things.  Half the game is finding all the extra places.There are no penalties in this game for game hints, hidden object hints, or puzzle hints.  There are no penalties for skipping either.  Very relaxed type of gameplay in a somewhat quasi-open world.Puzzles: mostly sliders, of various types and difficulty.  And one recipe puzzle.A few notes:1) This is a short game.  I took about 3 hours and I am slow.2) Love the music but the game does not say what the music is or who wrote it.3) The mask theme of the game is creepier then all the ghosts you see.4) Have no clue why there are so many ghosts out and about.In conclusion, this is a short, simple, detective mystery with supernatural elements.  The overall eerie atmosphere seems to be dated about a hundred years ago which is fine and lends a subliminal creepiness to all the locations, ghosts and characters.Worth the price?  Yes, especially when on sale."

That's it. Do yourself a favor do NOT get this game.Dear developer a few items of feeedback:1) waiting for items to appear, disappear or reappear seemingly at random should NOT be a core game mechanic.2) If you're going to have me travel between areas constantly, because you want more rooms than meaningful content in your game, at least give me either a quick travel or make them connect in a logical manner.3) If you release a game, make sure that you have checked the quality of the visuals of each location for consistency.4) If you're going to have a game relient on clicking/tapping, make sure that your controls are not needlessly precise.5) If you want a game to have a great UI and aesthetically pleasing HUD, fine, but don't have it block up parts of the screen with interactable content.6) If you're going to be using imagery that is setting consistent don't randomly do things because they are cool. I just dragged myself through a waferthin plot that incorporated visual imagery of the Black Plague and disease; had a killer that literally stumbled on a plank and fell to his death because he was wearing an impractical mask (no I'm not kidding); musical instruments and music itself that has been imbued with necromancy; devil-worshipping serial killers; and last, but not least, unexplained and unfounded claims of immortality. Seriously, stick to one. And since I happen to know a few of Edgar Allen Poe's stories, if they WERE inspired by him, I hope you've been cleansing your house with sage, because I expect him to haunt you until the end of time.7) Puzzles in hidden-object games can show ore variety than playing memory and sliding objects around.8) ""Hidden"" objects should not be hidden in plain sight, unless there is enough clutter around the screen for people to overlook them anyway. Using moving setpieces to obscure vision is NOT an enjoyable diversion, it's frustrating, too distracting and simply tedious as they even BLOCKED items I needed.9) If you're going to want me to interact with my environment more, even during the ""hidden"" object games do NOT place areas of interest without any form of indication in tiny little areas around the screen. They are easily missable and create the idea that the puzzles were rushed or simply lazily constructed.10) If you want me to invest anything at all in the characters you create, either don't have them pop up only once (you know what? Don't even bother naming them, if you do) or have me find clues to their life outside their current predicament in the surroundings.11) If you want me to feel like I'm doing haunted house-type magicky stuff don't give me ""puzzles"" that focus on finding bottles or twelve keys or whatever, have me go through alchemical formulae, finding magic runes and combining elements of sorcery.12) If you want to create a believable setting... ADHERE TO PHYSICS. The burner for the lacquer? That is NOT how that works. That bag that fell down, after being pulled off a branch DIRECTLY over water? That should NOT have landed two three meters away.13) If I go around looking for a whole bunch of useless crap on a screen cluttered with junk, at least have the sense to have me look for items that HELP me. I do NOT understand how looking for gems or whatever is going to somehow result in me getting a scroll! This is NOT logic, this makes NO sense and completely and utterly ruins the experience.14) If you want me to move pieces around a board or slide things around, give me the option of dragging them. Moving everything piece by piece, having to repeatedly select a target to move and a location to move to OVER AND OVER AND OVER... makes the game exceedingly tedious.15) If you're going to have me focus on a murderer with a fetish for doctors and disease, who is then implied to be into devil-worship in a pursuit for immortality: don't make it a jackass that falls off a wooden plank, to then start a new ""plotline"" about ghosts and a father trying to help his son. It makes no sense and is extremely unsatisfying. It wraps nothing up, I haven't accomplished anything and it makes the entire experience feel lazy, random, confusing and lackluster.And there's probably more, but I can't think of it right now and I feel like I've been exposed to this atrocity of a game for too long. It's a shame though, with an opening like that it had potential: the imagery was there, the insinuations of magic, the oppressive atmosphere."
,Recommended,430020,20138010,"Posted: 30 December, 2015",all,Juylyenne,"I thought the game was, overall, worth the sale price I bought it for. People forget that even simple games like this take time to program and make good art for. Which, as an artist, I do say is amazing. The atmosphere and art made me feel engrossed in this tiny little world. It is beautiful. And while some players have tagged this ""horror"", I would say there is very little to do with horror. A few ghosts pop out or things move across the screen, but it is more just atmospheric than meant for a scare. Finally, yes, there are steam cards. They may not have been working when the reviewer below posted their review. But they work just fine, now.Pros:-The art and atmosphere are beautiful.-The music is wonderful.-Puzzles to keep your mind working for a few hours.-Cute and simple story.Possible cons:-The game is rather short. Even I, who isn't the best at some puzzles, finished the game in 3 hours. So if you are hoping for an epic long game, this is not for you.-A game mechanic they relied on sometimes was simply ""go back to where you were"". Which I found frustrating. I never played any other puzzle game that used that. So when you have explored everywhere and can't figure out what to do, just go back to a room you've been in before and sparkles or ghosts might be there with the next step."
76561198049163803,Not Recommended,430020,20810387,"Posted: 28 January, 2016",all,MasterpieceLost,"Eh.  This one felt really phoned in, and it is extremely short- easy to beat in 3 hours.  But it was blissfully entertaining for how bad the plot was (if you like laughing at B rated films, this is up your alley), and had a few unique puzzles. If you can catch it at a substantial discount, go for it, but I would not recommend it, otherwise.For a game set around a mystery narrative, it was very weak on the mystery. and the narrative.  Most of the plot felt like a first draft with blank characters and some clear plot holes. Everything is spelled out in the very beginning of the story, often in a very clunky and forced fashion, defying the overall dynamic of having a mystery to solve. The final encounter with the enemy is EXTREMELY anticlimactic and involves no sense of agency.The aesthetic and startle moments beat you over the head with the message 'this is a horror! See? See the horror imagery!?' without even necessarily relating to the story or adding anything that hasn't been done to death before in the genre.The weaknesses in the game are especially disappointing given that they have some very interesting puzzles, and even bring a few things into their object scenes that I have not seen before in comparable HOGs.The in-game artwork itself is generally low grade (this speaking as someone who works in this field), though whomever was the UI artist clearly put a lot of love into making that aspect beautiful.Overall, I'd say that it did a couple things interestingly, but I'd much sooner recommend games like the Awakening, Dark Parables, Mystery Case Files, or Empress of the Deep franchises that do this genre really well."

76561197971341065,Recommended,430020,20120526,"Posted: 30 December, 2015",all,sfnhltb,"This is an okay hidden object game with a mystical theme and a lot of light jump scares and things crawling across the screen, mostly fairly easy puzzles with a few more difficult ones with a fair variety to them, the hidden object scenes are heavily weighted to the morphing object type scenes, and some scanning for places in the scene you can zoom into or interact with, so mostly you are just clicking on anything that moves or changes the cursor, rather than actually really looking for objects in the list, which isn't my favourite way of doing HOGs to be honest.The story is fine, if a bit formulaic - you know exactly what has happened from about two minutes in, who did it, so there isn't much in the way of story development through most of the game, it is all at the beginning and last couple of scenes. You play a detective investigating a missing boy, and this gives one of the good points of the game - your task list is very sensible, makes what you are doing logical and sensible, and things progress clearly as to what you are doing and why (as opposed to many HOGs where you just seem to randomly wander around finding items that you have no idea what you are going to do with, etc.), although with the proviso you seem completely unperturbed by the later tasks mostly are given to you by ghostly apparitions.A weak point is the layout of rooms/places, there are only really two locations in the game and the second one I found very confusing to navigate (especially outside), mostly relying on the hint button to get me to the right place rather than trying to work out how to get there myself. Another issue is it all being set in Venice, but we never really see anything of the city, just the inside of two houses and the grounds of the second which seems a bit of a waste of a great setting.Overall then a playable enough HOG with light horror elements, fairly short (probably a couple of hours if not repeatedly interrupted by cats), without any huge flaws but no great selling point either."
,Recommended,430020,22814589,"Posted: 5 May, 2016",all,osirish,"I wish there was a ""maybe"" option, instead of a straight ""yes"" or ""no"" recommendation.Dance of Death is a nicely presented HOG with beautiful artwork, music and atmosphere ... although it tries a little too hard with jump scares that add little to the game and perhaps even breaks immersion. The HO scenes are a little different with a lot of HO within a HO requiring multiple actions to find a single object. The puzzles, however, range from very easy to incredibly hard, and it hits you with a very hard one right at the start, they do get easier for the most part.If you are new the genre, there are better games out there. If you like HOGs and pick this one up, perhaps in a sale, you will probably get a few hours entertainment out of it."

Took me 1h30 to finish the game, without skipping the cut scenes.You play a detective called upon to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a young orphan.The manager of the orphanage explains that since the boy disappeared, the place became hunted. Why, because of dark magic.You go on a little journey in the orphanage, exploring the few rooms available, looking for clues on the boys whereabouts and who did this.I like the Goal list they incorporated in the game. Each time you accomplish a goal, they grey it out and when you've finished all the goals for the section and you need to head out, they establish new goals. You don't have to accomplish them in order, you just need to do them all to advance in the story line.The hidden objects games are few, but with a little twist to them, the red objects in your list are hidden, you have to find them or accomplish an act to reveal them. Pretty fun.You also have puzzle, which are fun and not to difficult.Over all, liked the game a lot and recommend it, if you don't mind it being a little short."

Who kidnapped Luciano? Why? Are ghosts real?Dance of Death is a casual adventure game rated apparently for adults, as Steam asks me my date of birth for age verification. The plot may deal with some ghosts but apart perhaps the dealing with ghosts appearing everywhere and the general ambiance of horror, I don't see why it should be rated high.The plot in itself is simple: save the boy from the evil man that needs him for his ritual of black magic. However, not every ghost is there to scare everyone, some of them will be friendly. Dance of Death is the name of the partition of the deceased father's boy, so, it's not a surprise to see skeletons in the menu or so many spooky references. However, the ending is quite anti-climatic. Oh hey villiain! Oh no more villain! I'm happy, I didn't have to protect myself! As you can see,One of the main problems of the game is, for me, the minigames. Some of them are a little disorienting and even with the rules, I had an hard time to finish some of them (like the masks of death as they're not really looking alike). I liked however the originality of some of them, especially those related to the missing parts of the medallion. The hidden objects scenes are quite rare but still easy and also full of originality (with moving stuffs). However, the metamorphs/beyong objects scenes are perhaps harder: you don't always see the appearance changing and I was always under the impression that I needed to find one to unlock the second (when many of them were already there).While I liked the ambiance and the tries to scare you, some actions aren't really making sense: how can I know that I need to go back to a room so that a ghost can appear and give me the needed item to advance? Also, the navigation inside the villa isn't making sense: why should I click on the bottom of my screen to reach a new location when the rest of the game is using that location to make you go back? I was really bothered by that.If the graphics are correct, the cutscenes involving real actors aren't as well done as I've seen in other games: I don't know why it's so hurting eyes, why the moves aren't natural at all. I don't know why the developers felt like they needed to add effects.The soundtrack is nice, so, your ears should be fine.Dance of Death is very brief, under 2 hours. That's another problem with the game. Usually, the genre has games that can go to three-four hours.4 bucks for the game seems a little expensive for me, so, if you see a discount, you should acquire the game. Given the fact that at the time of the writing, it's at -87%, it's a good bargain. But I would prefer many other better games if you want to give a try. That's why I can't quite recommend it. I can only do it for those who are curious and those waiting for a good discount."

As some other reviews have said, it tries too hard to be spooky and comes off as more silly than anything. The puzzles were relatively simple, and the 'story' laughably so as well. The final (and only) confrontation you have with your main villain is anticlimactic, lacking any sense of fear past the ""oh, hey there"" moment when they first show up, and it ends up resolved in a manner that screams 'bad ten-year-old fanfiction.' It is also extremely short, clocking me in at only about an hour and a half, 30 minutes of which was spent away from the computer making myself a snack and tending my pets. Someone really focused could easily complete this in about 40 minutes. As it stands, I might have to load the game and just let it run to get the trading cards involved.All in all, it's not the worst hidden object game I've ever played, being mostly functional (if a bit shabby in areas like voice acting and lip synching, along with the afformentioned areas), but unless you can get it for just a few pennies, I'd save your money for better games."

The points mentioned in the negative reviews are accurate: the plot is erratic and cluttered, there's no map so you'll be doing a lot of back-and-forth, and the skeleton ""frame"" blocks some of the screen, including parts you'll need to click on. It also has an annoying amount of railroading - you have to do things in the pre-established order.Those aside, the graphics are very good and some are just stunning; the puzzles are not frustratingly difficult or complex, and the music is pleasant, by which I mean, appropriately spooky.I have no idea why this game has an age lock; it's much less graphic and has less disturbing content than Fran Bow. It does deal with mature themes, but so does any murder mystery. I suppose it's the occult symbolism, or the fact that a child's life is on the line (which, erm... between games like Fran Bow and Binding of Isaac, I'm really not seeing that as the deciding point).If you like HOGs and the caveats above don't hit your do-not-want filter, this is worth playing.

The puzzles, though not particularily hard, are plenty, and most of them feel new (which is quite a treat after playing hundreds of HOPAs and being bored of the same puzzles being done over and over again).Sadly, the puzzles are the only thing this game does right. First of all, it's awfully short - it took me less than two hours to finish it, including a dinner break. There are no Steam Trading Cards, though the store page says otherwise, so if you considered buying it at a bargain for the cards, don't. The cards are a lie.But what's even worse is that this game is made so cheaply. The story falls flat. The graphics feel dated, the music is repetitive, and the voice acting is not only bad, but they didn't even get native speakers. Alawar is a Russian company, and the actors speak with such a heavy accent that ""sheet music"" ends up as ""sh*t music"" (I didn't make this up, I swear!). Also, the in-game messages are in bad English, too, e.g. mixing up ""famous"" with ""infamous"" or talking of someone as  ""one of our have-beens"" (still have no idea what this is meant to mean).Live is too short to play all Hidden Object Games on earth, even if they are short. Save your money on this one and make sure never to miss a game made by Polish studio Artifex Mundi, all of which are spectacular.EDITIt looks as if the trading card bug has been repaired. I haven't played the game since, but at least ""Dance of Death"" has appeared in my list of possible badges. So if you purchase cheap games for the trading cards, go along. It could be worse."

The puzzles are fine, you see a bit of range with them and there aren't many duplicates of the same puzzle, but a lot of them require you to wonder around until you find everything and THEN a ghost will drop the final piece for you.  Kind of annoying.On the plus side, the graphics are quite lovely and the music is good, although it does become a bit repetitive after a while.

No reason to replay but for the sale value of $1.00 it's enough of a time-killer to keep your attention if you're into standard puzzle conventions. It's nothing special, the same out-of-the-box brand you'll get from every other hidden object point-and-click you'll find on systems that come bundled with most bloat-wear computers. I would rate a 5/10. Not bad but nothing special either. The controls are pretty easy to figure out and the puzzles aren't too hard but the art leaves much to be desired.
