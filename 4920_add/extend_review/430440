It just 25€""You buy the game. And after a few days you realise you have been fooled, but since you have trained for your hard fight on the battlefield, there is no way to get a refund with 20+ hours.How would that feel? (Exaclty. Like you just have been completely F**kt over)Revitalising the playbase will be no easy task as the trust between the players and okam devs is somewhat broken. Adding to that the price tag at 25€ is hefty considering the content.I suggest either make it F2P or give us refunds. Since, this is not the product we bought almost a year ago."

Lack of blood and gore is kind of disappointing, but it is alpha and they focused else where. I'm sure it will be added.The combat is really fun and accessible, I didn't like it at first because I was so used to other melee combat, but now I prefer it. I've also grown to enjoy having no stamina bar, always found it ridiculous that your warrior in other games gets tired after 4 swings...dude you're about to die man up. For an early access game they have this down pretty good, just the typical hit detection bugs. Battles between skilled players can go on for quite some time, making kills rewarding instead of just going in a pile and sweeping the floor with a claymore sword, although thats still a viable stratgey, people can just hold their guard up, forcing you to diversify with blows/bashes/kicks. The combat system allows you to feint, block, and dole out hits all with the same button...sounds complicated, but with an hour or two it'll come naturally.The balance isn't too great. You'll be put with armored guys, who usually arent a problem if you somewhat know what your doing, but newbies dont stand a chance. I recommend playing duel and looking for other whiteys. People complain about 2h being op, but theres rarely any one shots if at all. It's early access this is always going to be in flux. The progression system could use a lot of work.The community is pretty supportive, developers are active, typical salty players that melee brings.The game has plenty of potential. In it's current state it offers some intense battles. Silly bugs. Kick fights. Spinning death knights getting mad cause spinning is counterable(Chivalry vets know). Derp knights. Shirtless swordmen. Soldiers completely missing thier upper arms...poor guys.Seriously might be hope for Early Access, dont let me down devs.As it stands 20 dollars spent is 20 dollars well invested.***Devs let me down....***"

There are more swing types, blocking is easier and more fluid and the hitboxes are very accurate. Obviously the other portions of this game are not fully fleshed out, but at the end of the day if you like the style of combat in mount & blade you will pick this up extremely quickly.The scale of battles and the density of fighting is what I have never really seen before. You will actually be in the middle of a brawl of almost 100 people and fighting miniature duels while the battle rages around you in every direction, and it does so seamlessly with zero lag and fluid graphics.If you're a fan of medieval fighting games like Chivalry, War of the Roses and M&B, you will love this game. You might as well just buy it right now and see for yourself."

,Recommended,430440,34886857,Posted: 11 September,all,Fox,"Of Kings and Men (OKAM) you've probably seen many reviews saying that this game was abandoned and all that, well it was not, a new team has taken the matters into their hands and has been updating the game since February if I'm not mistaken, those updates are quite nice introducing new mechanics as well as fixes.OKAM is currently the best medieval directional combat on the market, it is somewhat similar to M&B series, M&B has 4/5 stances OKAM has 9 (depending on what weapon you use) and since it has 9 stances it is harder to get that perfect block that allows you to counter attack faster than your enemy.Currently the last update has brought to us Raid mode which allows players to have their own troops and raid settlements for loot.To raid the enemy base and win attackers gotta capture flags till they get linked to the enemy base and then capture the base which is the last flag, this is where ruski tactics may work pretty well, if you Rush B you get Putins blessing and have 100% chance to win. You attackers may win without capturing the enemy base, they can kill all the troops.So, yes I recommend this game to you and your friends,  better start training for Stratember is approaching (Strategic Map) the latest update brought old and new players into the game preparing for strat, and no the game isn't dead."

The devs behind this game have outright lied to everybody. They've failed to deliver on almost any of their promises, and now everybody's gone. You'll be lucky if you can find a handful of players to play against on any server not in Europe, and even then it's just the same people you'll see over and over again. Combat is broken to a point where it's almost beyond repair, and two-handed swords are the only weapons that work. One-handed swords won't make contact with your opponent almost ever, and for whatever reason they actually swing slower than larger, heavier weapons. Additionally, they have shorter reach, less damage, and you get stunned if the enemy hits your shield. Two-handers, on the other hand, dominate every aspect of the game, and there's no sign whatsoever that they will ever be balanced out or nerfed. Don't even get me started on archery. There's also a leveling system where you can level up your stats and skills, but the skill section doesn't actually even do anything and there are really a couple of viable builds you can go with if you want to be any good at all. Don't bother balancing stats, just stack all your points into weapon speed, and then either damage or health. I used to actually be pretty good at this game, so I know what I'm talking about when I say that THE DEVS HAVE BROKEN THEIR OWN GAME."

I for one dont mind the weight. however there just is no content. none. thats the real bother. i can do the tdm and the mass wars that stuff is fun but because the devs arent adding new content there is literally like 10 people playing on a good day. so you cant even have an the experience shown on the store page. this game is a gem but its looking like a real turd the closer you look at it. since release, the content is just so bare minimum its actually embarrassing. like the devs at the bare Minimum here. When i say that im so serious, gloves, new sheild, Mustaches .... like cmon who see this midevil game and goes AHHHH YEAHH they have mustaches boisss lets purchase!!!!!. as awesome as that sounds in reality that's nothing lol. personally i cant make the devs do anything and i cant change what they want to proceed to make progress on. However as i person that is going to sit on this purchase and wait a long F****** time for this game to make it to open world, i think that needs to be their focus point right about now. if they move to making the world open with things to do they would have a player base in seconds. the combat is doable and their is potential but if i want to buy a game to have tdm sword fight ill go purchase chivalry. a bit of content to seperate yourself and stand out as an early access title will go a long ways. however that just my opinion. there are so many other ideas out there it wouldn't be such a bad idea to take the communities insight on what to do and strive to help bring players back into this game. for now this is a negetive review im hoping to change this in the future, but until then WE HAVE MUSTACHES BOIIIISSS."

I cant say disagree that the devs screwed us, but they are gone now, and we need more playerbase support to kickstart development again because at the moment its really slow"
,Recommended,430440,34917555,Posted: 13 September,all,Devolin✔,"Of kings and men has had a rough time and the original developers of the game under the pressure of the publishers promised things that simply were not ready to be released and making false promises while setting their admissions too high for their first game. But the one thing they did do right was make an awesome combat system so I commend them for that.With the new devs coming in and taking over the updates and content has been in full force and it finally seems like we are getting somewhere. This really excites me and the rest of the core-veteran players who have stuck with the game through its community dubbed “dark ages”.Combat: The combat system at its core is an 8 attacking and blocking directional system. But its soo so much deeper than that! Within the combat there's shoves, kicks, quick high risk high reward counter attack parrys. Also you can stop your attacks mid swing and faint your opponent and change your attacking angle or you can faint even more than once and really try to trip your opponent up. But you know don’t go overboard or it will look like your character is having an epileptic seizure mid fight. Anyway the point is trying to get to is that the combat system is very very deep and provides an almost endless combination of attacks and fighting styles. Often new players will be woefully bad at the beginning and get destroyed by the veteran players. Most of the bad reviews of this game are from players with very low hours which I suspect is because they are bad gamers and didn't understand or were overwhelmed by the combat in this game then just quit. I've even seen reviews from these low hour players who have said the combat is simple, again i suspect they didn't get into the more advanced fighting mechanics that you need to fight at the top level.Story: So I like combat games that have a nice story element to them. Unfortunately Of Kings and Bois Does not have any real story elements as of yet. Hopefully we will see some more story features in the future.Graphics: The graphics In my opinion are very nice and fit the feel of the game well and really set a nice medieval atmosphere. In terms of specifics the artists have gone for a realistic style and that can sometimes lead to higher poly assets that you wouldn’t find in a more cartoony looking game, but the artists have done a good job making low poly, well textured and normal mapped assets and terrain. This is great because it's easier for us to play it on low end rigs and get high fps.Player base and community: So this is another area that all the negative reviews focus on, and yes the player base is low but telling people it's flat out dead is a lie. Every night there is more and more players on and it finally feels like the game in becoming alive again. At the moment this game is very much a peek hour game on EU and US servers so to really experience playing in big teams with others you will have to join in peak hours (6-10 gmt +0). As for the community in the game it's a very alive and tight knit one with a few main clans that have regular fights and organised wars. If you want to get involved you should check out the official OKAM discord and forums, and if you want to get the most out of the game you should join a clan and experience organised combat as well as training from some of the best players.Final thoughts: As you can probably tell I very much like this game, I’m completely enamored by the combat system and its depth also the community in this game is a lovely one to be apart of, it keeps me entertained. I understand that this game might not be the most user friendly game and very approachable to casual gamers who just want to exercise a medieval battle or two, but i implore you to give it a shot and learn the mechanics. I really want this game to succeed! P.s sorry for the long read I didn't mean for it to be this long."

At the beginning of this release the devs were saying they were going to release a mode called the epic. Well it turned out to be an epic fail. So the devs decided to take it step by step rather than focus on somting massive while the core game is incomplete. The reason I recommend this game is because the community is by far the best I have seen compared to other games. There are competing clans in this game from across servers but they are all friendly to each other and love good competition. The community is funny and enjoyable to talk and play with. The devs really do care about your views on the game and give regular updates on what they are planning on doing aswell as frequent updates to the game in all aspects. I quit this game after the epic fail but decided to come back after a couple of months playing off and on. The updates have drasticlly changed and optimized this game. They are planning on releasing more game modes and soon get back to the epic. I hope this was helpful!

They kept saying they would hire a profesional coder, or good engineers.The only guy they hired was a forum moderator who instead of working spends its time fighting the angry customers on discord, and the others are trying desperately to make things work but they just cant find whats going on, as chadz on the epic for 2 month now.I always said, that this dev team would be fired instantly in a normal company where good customer approach and profesionality is requiered.And after 2 months here we are, without any single patch, with a playerbase of 20 peakplayers per day over all the servers.

A very good thing this game has is a very nice, friendly but also competetive community, which pushes the game forward. The developers also listens to what the community wants and makes it happen, and that is very important to me for a game thats in early access. They are now working on the strategic map which gonna be main mode of the game, and I think it will bring the even more people to the game and make it even more fun.I would recommend the game if you for exampel enjoy Mount & Blade or just like medieval combat games."

Laggy. Connections in-game always have a 50/50 chance of either being slow or simply throwing you out.2. Buggy. When you launch the game it does so in a very slow manner, moreover when you start a game you have to hope it connects or even wants to launch.3. Unpolished. Arrows sometimes feel like floppy weeners. With that i mean the hit system with the arrows is not up to standards yet. More-so are the character models and the game UI.4.The Epic. When i bought the game i was presuming 2 things: A. It would be released or shown fairly soon. B. It would allow the player to play single-player against AI and have a Open-World experience. This could be my own misunderstanding with what i was getting but this is what i got out of the games information.+ Points:1. The combat seems to be somewhat inventive with having to block your opponents attacks from side to side and watching your positioning when fighting people with two handed swords.2. The concept. This could be a great game and that's why i bought it knowing full well it isn't finished yet.Recommendation:I would'nt recommend it right now.It's laggy, buggy and overall not worth the money (At the moment).I'm recommending people who might want to buy it, to !WAIT!.At the moment the game is not worth it's pricing since it has very little content.Look back at this game in about 1-2 months and see for yourself if it's worth the price and if the opinions of the game have raised.Recap - Points:I know it's a Alpha so Laggy, buggy and unpolished are to be expected, yet atm it's even below standard for normal alpha's out there."

Waning player base, no substantial progress, or implementation of the Epic which in hindsight seems like little more than an advertising gimmick to get more people to buy the game.

Il be honest, i think its a really good base for an epic game... is it anywhere near that point yet ? Sort answer... No.The game needs, gore, smoother animations, the feel as if you actually hit opponants rather than having to look at your Exp reward all the time, needs simple functions like picking downed players weapons up, needs better in battle sounds, could do with a slicker menu screen for the barracks screen. Better combat. I seem to find my self in confussion as to how i didnt block that, or how did that not land! its partly because i doesnt feel that good unlike M&B Warband etc..Even after all this I can see the massive potentail, im looking forward to the devs delivering us a EPIC campaign game with building, crafting and NPC.. commanding etc.. but we will have to see.If you want to walk into the game expecting smooth user friendly combat, forget it."

The combat is very fun and skill based and with the large scale battles currently in 75 vs 75 it can feel amazing when you chop down person after person. Or if you prefer to duel in a dueling server and pick up the blocking mechanism.Pros:-Good Combat skill based-Gorgeous graphics, gorgeous enough-Perfect optimization (for most)-HUGE BATTLES-Battle Cries make the game more epic-The leveling system-Map design-RoadmapCons:-Archery-two handers can sometimes break the game if they spin in circles but you can counter them with 2 people-The sheild blocking mechanic needs a touch up-Single handed weapons need speed buff-I'd like some blood-The use of shield walls should have more of an impact on the gameThis game is already a technical achievement as I have no lag with 200 dead bodies on screen and 150 people slashing it out as well.I have faith that the developers will continue to improve this game even if it takes awhile.

I can actually recommend this game in it's current state based off the new features they have added and its very satisfying and authentic melee combat. This game just needs a bigger playerbase now but it has one of the best communities i've seen for a long time, with devs and admin ready to assist you for anything from finding the right clan to optimising your settings.If we give these new devs half the benefit of the doubt we gave the old ones this game will become what we all wanted it to, which is basically mount and blade online--- Old review----Basically everyone bought this game because they thought they were buying a persistant open world medieval battle game,and rightfully so because that was what the trailers and descriptions of the game were focused on.So I personally got this game a couple of days after realise so i'm not sure what state this aforementioned ""epic mode"" was in but by the time I had installed the game it was taken down, with a release from the devs stating how sorry they were and how epic mode would be back in a couple of weeks.I wasn't too upset as this gave me a chance to hone my skills in the 2 small pvp modes that were on offer, as did everyone else who bought the game. This is where us as consumers made our mistake, we should have refunded the game right there and then or at least not played it for more than 2 hours so we couldn't get a refund (i'm convinced this was a conscious tactic employed by the devs).Soon as those 2 weeks steam allows for refunds was up all word of Epic mode became silent. Devs were still vocal but they were talking about upcoming features for pvp which noone really cared about. We were led to believe that epic mode was essentially complete but was just pulled for polishing and now it doesn't look like they ever started it or have even begun a year on.So here we are about a year later and none of us can get a refund because we were practicing for a game that will never come out. This isn't a case of being unfair to a game in early access. I'm not upset that i bought Dayz because I knew what state the game in was when I was buying it, even if I was overly optimisitic about the devs abilities to improve it. These devs simply lied about the features in the game at the point of sale and continued to lie to ensure noone refunded. Even if Epic mode actually does come out you shouldn't buy this game.

The game plays a lot like warband, and this is a good thing in my opinion. Controls are mostly familiar and 9 angles to attack and defend from means that skill decides the fight. You cannot really go on massive killing rampages, taking out numerous enemies if outnumbered. 1v1 is a fair fight, but when you are teamed you will die with little chance of survival, which is realistic. choose your fights wisely.

Essentially all you get to do now and most likely will ever do in game is run around by yourself in a skirmish battle because the servers are dead in fact, i have never seen another player in game since I purchased but it's open world, and there's..NOPE, NOTHING.Obviously upset and dissapointed in the develepopment team and STEAM for taking players money -  no refund cause wha it's been in my library for 2 days - DO NOT BUY and if you already bought and just reading reviews GET YOUR REFUND."

No fighting mechanics come anywhere close to that of Of Kings and Men.Having already written one review whilst the previous dev team was in control I now felt it necessary to update my views since the new team is well underway to implementing its version of the game. All of those who say the dev team abandoned the game and scammed people, they are false accusations. The Donkey crew was forced out of the game by their own investors.The game is updated very regularly and the game is always being patched. The new STATEGIC MAP will be being released soon which is sure to bring players and clans back to the game.The steam page has also been updated with more realistic advertising that isn't misleading to the noobs who keep screaming SCAM. You have to understand this game is immensely EARLY ACCESS, something that steam users can’t seem to grasp very successfully. The game has been built from the ground up using its own engine.I commend the new development team on the hard work they have put into the game and I hope that their continued success will enable people to also see that the game has come along way from the epic."

Its a shame because the game got a lot better thanks to the new devs. Community is getting back on its feet while strategic map is just behind the corner. I always believed that okam will succed but for the first time it really look like it will.One of the reasons many of the people kept playing the game from the start till now is because you wont find better combat system in any game. I have been playing Of kings and men from the start and I dont regret any second I spent in it.I think a lot of you especially the players that came after the epic fail felt discouraged by the ammount of deaths they had. Okam recently became fairly easy for the new players. Its still a highly skill based game but you are not going to die as often anymore. You will start with all the skill points that you can distribute how you please and getting top gear is question of few hours tops.

Look for Sons of Heroes and join our army! and remember, at the end of the day your performance in a battle is only worth AT most 400-700 EXP if you play well, its far more important to win and finish the match, the reward is 1500EXP, and 1000EXP for only finishing as of this review."

The movement feels really good and we are all use to using the right mouse to block and left mouse to attack but I like that this is different, it adds a new feel to the fights which is a good thing. Yes it crashes,but is only exspected as early access. I purchased H1Z1 in early access & it had the same problems but now it runs really well & think this game will follow suit. Things I would like to see in the game: Blood!, some more atmosphere sounds to give the game some real feel that your in a open space. not just swords clashing. Gear that actually protects you more for the xp that you have earned. 2/3 hits system not very good in my opinion. I dont want to just look good, I want to be protected more for earning the gear i have got & the weapons I have earned to do more damage. It takes a long time to level & earn that gear you know!!! lol. What about some rain & mud? What about a crouch for the shield wall? Unsure if the game needs a jump yet like ATHOS says because ive not really needed a jump yet in the game but maybe it will need it later in gameplay?

When they were typing all this in gameplay I said we need to let you guys know so things can be added to what the players themselfs want adding to the game to make it better & most just said "" BUT WERE TO BUSY HACKING & SLASHING!!

I was extremely excited for this game but also a bit nervous, as No Man's Sky turned out to be a complete disappointment I was worried that the same would happen to this game. I was wrong. This game is awesome! It still has several glitches but the devs are constantly patching and they listen to the community very carefully. The combat is great, and the best part is: IT'S ONLY EARLY ACCESS! I can only imagine how awesome this game will be when it fully releases, with siege engines and siege battles, spears and throwing weapons, horseback riding and combat, and best of all: FACTION WARS!

The massive 150 player (later 200) battles are a lot of fun and the graphics are good. The character leveling system is well balanced and interesting as it allows you to make your own custom warrior, knight, soldier, etc. There are a lot of interesting weapons' and armors' to choose from and I believe more will be added.

You can check out their game road map as an example here:http://forum.ofkingsandmen.net/index.php?topic=388.0. The creators of OKAM have a history in Mount & Blade as the creators of cRPG mod and are well known. They have a track record of keeping their promises and being dedicated. There is no reason to suspect it will be any different for their own title.Whereas the game is in an incomplete state right now, the gameplay does not suffer. The combat system is deep and rich and there is plenty to learn and updates are coming out regularly and the open communication and responsiveness from the devs is almost unparralled from other games.I strongly recommend picking up this title and look forward to their continued updates and the progression of this Early Access game.

There are two types of persons. People that played this game a lot and people who disliked it instantly. You cant really find a bad review from someone with more than 50 hours most of them have even less than five hours in the game.The question if this game worth for you or not depends on what you want. The greatest thing on this game is the Combat. It has so much variety and even with nearly 500 hours in this game i can still improve a lot. There is always something new to try and with every hour you play, you will more and more develope your own style which makes you a unique fighter in the world of OKAM. There are many people who persuits to the perfection and are very hard to beat.This game is very skill based and it doesnt matter if you are level 1 or on max level. You have the same amount of stats and heavy armor can be farmed fast. But also light armor has its adventage and a lot people prefer to us it.Is this game something for you ?If you are new it will be very hard or impossible for you to beat experienced players, not because they have better gear or something, just because they are more skilled and experienced. Experience in other medieval games does definitly help you a lot!If this motivates you to envolve yourself to beat them one day, train alone in nights to perfect your technique then this game is definitly something for you.If you just want to come into the game and swing your sword around to kill randomly people then you better stay away.The biggest disadventage now is the lack of content. There is still a lot to add and you should have a detailed look on whats is already in the game before you buy it.The darkest days are gone!OKAM had a lot of trouble in the last year. False promises , undelievered content and the whole dev team stopped working on this game. For about 4 Months there were completly silence. The game is owned by Green Men Gaming and they hired a full new developement team. They give there best to deliever what they announce and working constantly since around 6 months with constant updates on the game. If they announced something in the past, the worst case was maybe 1 week delay.The have a structured Plan on it which can be read on their discord. They are passionated in what they to and i have no doubt they will deliever all what they announced. A lot of things are already in!Players coming back!One of the most read sentences in comments reviews or whereever when talked about OKAM is: OKAM Is dead!Well it isnt the most visited place on earth but these days i see a lot new players and the playerbase has it biggest growth since the release in August 2016.The main reason for this is probably the upcoming patch next month! They announced a stratetic map for next month which is a basic version of first mentioned ""the epic"". This means there will be a map with territorys where you can fight with your clan for land, power and wealth. Once this Milesstone is archived, there can be added more things like horses, combat improvements and much more.The Game isnt easy but a lot of fun also the currently Community is nice and will help you if you just ask. There are also many clans which are happy to welcome you in their clan, so you can fight with them together for territory when ""Strat  Map "" is out.What ever you do, stay nice!"

Otherwise when you go to fight it puts you in a dueling server where you can fight bots to get better over time.Since my last review, you no longer have to grind and grind and grind and grind for that sword you want, you can get gold pieces to unlock armor and weapons, its not as grindy as it once was but it will still take time.

The first game I got into I was stunned by how good the world looked(I joined a conquest gamemode) and how many people were on my team; 75 in total for each side. We all spawned in and a ferocious spamming of ""t"" was done with the disgruntled yells and grunts of lowley archers, to behemoth men wielding pitchforks and two handed cleaver/swords. It got me pumped and ready to go...until my first ecounter with an enemy that decided to use his 2h sword to stab me straight through my cloth armor. I was dead, but went back for more. I practiced via the Duel gamemode and honed my average skills. Also, I decided it'd be bad♥♥♥♥♥to run around shirtless and as of now, I am shirtless, have a nice steel helmet with chainmail and platelegs. I run into battle to capture the flag and fight off big burly men in heavy coats of armor with their greatswords. It is just so much fun, and I am awaiting future content updates. Also, the blue team seems to always fair better in battles(I have no idea why).

In about five days the main portion of this game, The Epic, will be released. Once that happens, you can expect a dramatic decrease in players on the other game modes. For Conquest, this is going to be catastrophic since it relies on many players to join a match. Therefore, do not buy this game for the gamemode you have seen streamers and YouTubers play.2. There is a bit of a learning curve at the beginning. It's just a matter of learning the basic attacks (where to move your mouse for a certain attack) and developing tactics to better capture and defend the flag.3. If you've ever played War of the Roses and read the cancerous messages in chat, you can expect that here and then some. Teamwork is a distant notion, it's like a giant public TF 2 match.4. Servers have been acting up. Devs have fixed the issue as it occurs, so expect downtimes but not for long.Other than that, it's a fairly solid game. No game breaking bugs."

It's only a matter of time before this game builds in popularity and content (as it is still early days for the game).I'm really looking forward to the persistent ""Epic"" side of the game also, as I feel the pvp mode will get really repetitive unless they create different modes, like in Chivalry for example. Something you will hear a lot is that the game has a long way to go. Yes that's true, but it plays remarkably smoothly, and is just a little bare bones which is clearly going to change with the new mode.

Some how they really pinpointed balanced teams, both teams have mixed players that are expierienced and ones that are just getting started, its awesome its always challenging really hard to stop yourself from playing. The beginning is kinda rough because there are lots of expierienced players but like an hour or so into it you will start getting the hang of it.

The combat can be fun and it feels like a step up from warband, which could be a good thing or a bad thing.Content at the moment comes in three flavours:CONQUEST: Around a dozen or so battles fought over changing terrain which mainly involves capturign and holding the flag for a set amount of time. The initial round is in a team deathmatch style, with unlimited respawns. When a flag is captured the winning team must then defend it  from the other team, the only thing is, everyone only has one life so things can get dicey.SKIRMISH: Never actually got to play a round of skirmish so far.DUEL: Fight other players 1v1 - i'd recommend this for new players just so they can get some practice in as the real thing can make it hard to learn right away.You gain xp from killing, assisting kills or just being in the vicinity of fighting, as well as bigger bonuses for a round ending and a ""Campaign"" ending. When I say ""Campaign"" I just mean the point when all scores are reset and teams are shuffled.You gain levels and choose to put points into 4 different stats, so you decide whether you want to be able to swing a bit faster, take more damage, move faster etc.Gaining xp also acts as a progress bar so you can unlock new gear to use. You start out with some padded cloth and a variety of low tier weapons to start out with. What you use is up to you. This is the main thing that kept me playing.If it's on sale for 50% then get it, otherwise it might be worth waiting for new content."

I join a match and spawn then freeze and unfreeze for about 5 minutes while the game is rendering. Ok so this doesn't bother me too much but can be annoying (i have a fairly good pc, can run ac revelations at max setting with 60 fps). The combat is just a copy and paste of mount and blades combat though, the only difference is that you can swing diagonally but people dont really use it that much anyway. But here is the issue that makes me the most mad, the loading times. Joining a match cand literally take 5-20 minutes (an average of 7-15 for me). But the worst part is that after this insane loading time is done the game just freezes. Yep, just freezes, i have only played 4 matches but every single one of them had a game breaking freeze and two of them caused me to have to reset my whole computer.

But as a hardcore fan of Medieval games I had to support this. This game is suprisingly very well put together for being in early Alpha. Little to no bugs I have came accross :)Please before you talk smack, make sure you have the system requirements to play the game. The game itself supports 200 player sever battles and looks gorgious! please keep that in mind before purchasing or giving a bad review.People have been saying this game is very Similar to M&B. It is, but it also is not. It has far more than 4 attack directions. Weapons vary but the average is up to 6 to 8 attack/block/parry directions!Combat is very fluid, it seperates itself from titles such as The Wars series/M&B. Its actually almost on par with Kingdom Come when applied to attack directions/and graphics IMO.The only thing that can get frusterating at times is some of the weapons are a bit unbalanced particularly two handed weapons and halberds. Though I would be more suprised If it didn't have balancing Issues (mind you those things can be fixed easily and the Devs are very open minded to reading and talks to the community :3)Lastly, as far as gameplay, multiplayer. This is just the bare bones. There will be a open world later on where players can just simply meet up and build villages/towns/castles together! Factions will be introduced as they compete for the worlds resources. While big battles are moved to another server to handle the population cap.I 11/10 recommend this game for anyone who loves medieval games!"

Thier only real experiance in making games, is creating a mod for Warband that did alot of things right, and was brilliant in many respects, but overall a bad joke.The community in particular is terrible, imature, and incredibly trollish. You can and will find plenty of friendly decent people playing, but overall its the crpg community and its problems all over again.I am interested in the combat system, for long time melee players who have dominated WOTR\Chiv\Warband and its mods, the system wont take very long to get the hang of. I enjoy it alot, but am concerned about future weapon development, mauls and hammers will look and feel off with this swing system. Which might mean some weapons will never be released, or wont have as many stances as other weapons.The progression system is hard to comment on, it is set to change, and the sooner the better. New players have not only a great learning curve to deal with ( if they are new to this genre ) and old players have to deal same problems crpg had. They have made it so you cant go past a certain level stat wise, so you cant have too high of a stat advantage. But the gear progression is bad, confusing, and rewards players who have more time to play. I havent put that much time into this game, but my kds are unreal, 100-11 everytime i play, for 3 days in a row is disgusting. I ve only put 30hours in, only played Duel, but because i can kill, I got my gear early. 100-11 isnt very impressive when most of them are fighting new players in cloth, taking 5 of their hits and killing them in 2. There is no DTV training for new players, but ill get to that.You'd think with those kds I would be throughly enjoying myself. Iam not. I only get those kind of killstreaks because all the good players arnt on Duel. They are playing conquest, a mode that looks gorgeous and lots of fun...if you have a good enough computer to run it. The minimum requirements for this are way off, I am one of a number of players who have much better than the minimal requirements, and still cannot play conquest. So while all the players that are on my level are fighting each other on conquest, im forever stuck in duel. And i can only play for a couple hours at a time, before my computer gets very loud and combat gets too wonky to play. Again, this WILL be a grinding game, whether you are grinding for stats or gear, or grinding muscle memory to be pro, the more you play the more you will be rewarded. It makes sense, works, but really sucks for those that want to play, should be able to, but cant due to poor optimization, and falsly advertized requirements.Which brings me to patches. You'd think that optimization would be the biggest priority, and if it was for Donkey Crew, this review might not exist. The idea that you have already started balencing the game, around nerfing, based on the whines and cries of incompetent players who havent put any time or effort into learning to play. Game has barely been out, Ive seen people of every class dominiate and do well, and instead of optimizing the game, so more players can give accurate feedback, you are going down the road WOTR went.Balencing isnt even close to top priority here. You have the bots to do DTV, but no DTV. You could have a server where new players could go and train without getting humiltiated by pros, or bullied by trolls in chat. Id like something to do other than beat up on new players to the genre, but so far there is Duel and Conquest only, and Skirmish on the way. Why we are adding competitive servers, instead of training servers, in early access? Its crpg all over again, brilliant ideas, tons of potential...but execection that has you scratching your head.To sum it up briefly: This game has a long LONG way to go, and seemingly no real path or series of goals, everything feels so experimental, which was a huge problem with WOTR. Unless you have a computer that has the Recommended specs, i wouldnt bother buying. Its a huge tease to be a top tier player, that has a comp better than the required specs, but cant run with the other pros in conquest. And idk when ill be able to, as optimiztion is less important than balencing, especially if your aim is to add competitive servers like Skirmish. Community aint really worth it, like if you're not one of the ""kewl"" kids thats runs around spamming the ""N"" word, than you only do well because your build\gear. Even if you are forced to adapt and do disgusting things like S-KEY, then they will ♥♥♥♥♥ at you for that.

I bought this game because after seeing it has a combat that is similar to what M&B offers.Controls of this game may take a few hours of dueling to get used to. But once you get used to it, you will see its superior to M&B. The reasons why I find this game's combat better:1) You have to block directionally even with a shield. So shield users are now at an absolute disadvantage versus 2-handers, but their shields protect them from archers. In mass combat, I believe sides will need a healhy mix of all three classes.2)You both block and attack using LMB. At first it will be confusing but after a few hours of dueling, you will see you are figting much more smoothly this way.3)There's bash in the game in addition to kick, which allows you to deal with face-huggers like never before.Dueling servers have no lag or fps problems for me but Capture The Flag servers where 100+ players fight in the same map at the same time need a little bit of improvement, but even CTF is playable and enjoyable.You can only play duel or CTF at this time, but i think even the current content justifies a buy."

I am however amazed at the level of detail perhaps put into the Physics of this game (I've seen people block arrows accidentally with the tip of their blade) (Aiming to slash the legs bypasses the shield, etc.) And although the Epic (the whole point of the game) hasn't been released yet during this review...

It might take you more than an hour or so to get a hang of it if its your first time, but when you do its extremely fun waging into a thick fight and coming out a medival god. Personally I rush the 2handers, easy kills behind the safety of my shield. The game still needs a little work, but thats why its called ""early access"".

On paper it sounds complicated however the tutorial that the team built is very simple and teaches you the mechanics of the game.In its current stage customization in Of Kings And Men isnt the most in depth system for example you cant customize your characters body or face but you can change his armour and weapons, in the game you start with a white gambeson a couple of helmets and an arsenal of starting weapons if you decide to use the mace then you will progress with that and it will lead onto you unlocking the 2 Handed Sword, If you progress with the 1 Handed Sword it will lead you onto more 1 Handed Swords and the same system is with the armour.In Of Kings And Men you can also mold your characters skills to your liking for example if you wanted to be a tank that absorbs damage for your team then consider investing skill points into Health Points, but if you want to be a warrior that deals a lot of damage then invest skill points into Damage, however the skill system is not like every ordinary game when you level up you not only get 1 skill point but you als get 1 respec point these are unique as they do the complete opposite of skill points they decrease your chosen skill but in the process it gives you an extra skill point once you use it so if you wanted to try out a completely new play style there are no limits go ahead!Despite all the good stuff about this game there is obviously got to be some negatives as there is with every game but I cant be too harsh as this is an early access review however I have to notify you as you are probably about to buy this game, as Of Kings And Men is in early access there are some bugs and features that generally annoy the public like teamkilling... Uhhh!! As for bugs the hitboxes are not on point so sometimes even tho your shield is up people cut right through it and damage you this does not always happen though there is also some balancing issues with weapons.~No Current The Epic Review~KIMBOF1's Score = 4.5/5Although theres a few bugs here and there this is a very enjoyable game and i recommend you buy it as you rarely come across games like this, apart from Mount and Blade XD."

But after the dev team changed, we get regular updates,  developers listen to the community. The recently added Raid mode has brought life to the servers. and it is a very fun gamemode to warm up with for the strategic map.You won't find huge 100vs100 battles here just yet, but at prime times the battles are very enjoyable and there are enough people to make it fun.The biggest upcoming update is of course the ""strategic map"", which will allow clans (and lone wolves) to battle for castles and fiefs, and of course honor.All in all, if you are looking for a great melee combat game, this is it.

What I don't get it why so many people have denounced this game as nothing but rubish. Never have I found combat in a game more skilled and fun to learn than in this game. I was happy to be a grunt on the large 50v50 battles that happened the first weeks the game was out. The game is fun when there is a community.Sadly most of the community has left because of the failed launch of the Epic. No one seems to want to actually play the amazing mechanics and combat, along with large scale battles that are available to everyone still. Maybe the epic hasn't come out yet but that's no reason to denounce a game with far superior combat compared to chivalry, which in the current state of the game it is somewhat similar too (two teams heading it off to capture objectives). Not to mention there are significantly larger numbers of players available to play with, if anyone could look past the Epic and actually play the game for what it is.If you're one of the hundreds writing review of how the epic was denied to you as a consumer, look around the game and realize everything else the game still has to offer in the mean time."

At first I sucked at melee and now I'm halfway decent although I still get owned by most good players.  The game as is can host 75 vs 75 combat in a capture the flag type gameplay.  Its very addicting and very fun.  You have attributes to level up.  You can get to lvl 10 and for each level you gain one attribute.  This can be placed in damage, hit points, speed, attack speed.  Also there are many different weapons and armours that you can unlock.  For example there is helmet, chest, feet, gloves, shield, 1 hand weapons, 2 hand weapons, bows.  This game is in development so its by no means a finished product.  The epic is supposed to be released soon which will offer a ton more game play and a lot more players that currently play crpg and other medieval games will flock back here.  The combat is very fluid.  Its easy to pick up but hard to master.  You use left mouse to attack and depending on where you have your mouse (the direction) depends where you will swing.  To block is similar.  You have poke attack, right and left attack,  right and left high and low and overhead smash.  You can also shield bash, kick, parry, and yell.  The next big patch should be in the next week or two so now is a good time to pick this game up.  If your a fan of mount and blade, crpg, and other similar combat oriented games, strategy games, medieval games, rpg, open world, chess, risk, pick it up.  Most players are melee but there is ranged combat as well ie archery at the moment.The epic will feature 200 vs 200 real players fighting over land, castles, resouces.  There will be 4 factions and 2 set times to fight during the day and whoever controls 51 percent of the map will be declared winner.  And they will be reset every 3-4 months.  There will be horses, crossbows, and tons and tons of new improvements added to the game.  Pick it up guys its a great bargain at 25 dollars."

Consider to make some animation improuvment. Add new anim sequences .Like active evade . Remove jumping on place. If you wanna some realism try to jump in place and see how time it should take no matter with or without armor. Forbid naked entering on battlefield. Only peasants were was Naked and believe me they cannot swing a swords onle Hoes. Improuve armor type resists. They suck atm. Try to consult some scenary choreographic adviser about some points in sword fighting. Give more explanation about stats on items and character stats and skills .How they corespond each other. Add First person camera. Tweek weapons height .It's little strange to die fron stears body when i am full plate . Plate should reduce a large portion af blunt damage. Add strafe animation - like step or step and a half. When character is not overcoumbered add roll animation. Add temoral sprint / charge. Its realy sucks to run over that naked archer. I pay full price for a 3 maps of PvP wich a mosly empty. I like the idea and potential this game have. The Epic Mode is similar to War Mode in Heroes and generals. Make weapon hanling more intuitive.  Make stance locking in altiture difference between combatiants.I don't know whats a financial expectation of investors , but for this price peoples expect more. I understand that this is Early Access alpha or not , but at the moment developers should work on content like level design / raw mechanics and so. It should be realy nice to add  more cultural Armors stiles and so on. I look forward for this game, so i wish you full time enjoyment when you create this worlds."

The style of combat makes it hard to do dumb 360 slashes like in mount and blade and chivalry. you use LMB to block/attack. Its weird but it works really well and gives the game a great feel. You have real sword fights now instead of jumping around and running and doing 360 jump slashes to kill noobs.i recommend it.

There are probably a whole host of balance issues at the moment though it's hard to tell as some people are just much better at the game, and can make any weapon seem OP. Personally I feel that with the wide range of abilities just now, everything seems pretty balanced.The game currently is very barebones, just large scale matchmaking battles with no wider goal. The combat is very engaging and fun, and at the moment is the only thing keeping you playing, I'd say that's the most important thing to consider if choosing to buy. In the future of course there will be a much larger game ""The Epic"" which everything is based around, and I'm also looking forward to having a lot more weapons/armour/smithing and factions/heraldry.As of writing this review The Epic has been revealed but is still paused. Even though it hasn't started yet the tabletop map looks really good and I'm really excited to see it in action.If you want to experience being in a massive 75v75 battle with engaging combat and a relatively steep learning curve and awesome music I would definitely recommend this game."

There are no strategy and no coordination at all. Just hack and slash. Also many players attack their own friends on purpose..But often this happen by accident since it is actual really hard to see who is friend and who is the enemy since there are no ""team colour"". yes the uniforms are good looking that might be historic and beautifull, but once people move and fight it become very difficult to see who is who. YES your friends do have a small triangle icon above your head but once there are like 20+ people the same place that all move forward and back hacking and slashing then it is just hard to see who is who and very easy to hit your own friends.I played as an archer in my first few battles and it was very difficult to see who is who from a distance so I focus my fire on other archers or people running against us.. I almost gave up supporting my own troops who where sword fighting since I could not really see who was who.Would be much better with some kind of team colour on the uniform so it is easy to spot the enemy.Other than that in 7 houres from now they release a new feature. It is a tactical 2d map where you can create factions and attack and conqure other regions.. This look promising.In genreal the game look promising but there really need some kind of coordination and strategy, els everybody just run arround like chickens without a head.But im excited about the 2d feature and the ability to build a kingdom and conqure others.but again we need some kind of coordination/strategy since the coorporation right now is non excisting. Also we need diplomacy and such things.Maybe what the game need is a king/captain/sergent.The sergens should have 10-20 people with him, and the captain should lead 4 sergents.The leader/king should be able to make the grand strategy example capture this point/defend here.Well something like that, then it would be possible to cordinate things, and reward people for following their leader and staing in a group kind of thing.Should you buy this game YES.. But it is in early access so do not expect a full game with many missing features and balance."

You can use MB2 if you have a shield though, took me a while to figure that out.- 2h weapons feel op, feel like swing speed needs some nerfing.- Small bugs and some game crashes, but barely noticeable. i.e corpses being frozen standing up.- No ragdolls for now.- Needs Coat of Arms or colored teams instead of a slightly transparent white overhead triangle.- Unlocking armours and weapons can feel and become a bit grindy.- The Epic not released :(.- Combat hitboxes feel a bit out of place, idk. It's probably just me.Tbh, I think you should just buy the game or watch gameplay and see for yourselves if you like it.Or just wait a few more months and check the game out again."

Hold to guard and release to strike makes the battle flow more smooth and intense.Shield mechanism is awesome, you can still block like 2h or polearm with your 1h sword, which grant shielders and shield wall attacking capability as they should have. And shielders are no longer invicible turtles but still have ""Free"" and easy blocks at a cost of losing attack oppurtunity.With much more stances,polearms finaly get their rightful overhand stab amniation now. Cheers.Polearm finally have true longer reach than 2h great swords, because the charactors are no longer dumb and dumbers that always hold their poles at the same positions.2h players are still formidable grinders due to synergy of attack speed, reach and damage. your sensible judgement of distance, positioning and tempo are your shield and cutter.Archers no longer have laser pointer (crosshair), which is correct decision. More and more FPS games such as red orchestra are using iron sight to aim, this is the right trend.You can hear the noise of blade slashing the mail of your opponent or feel the blunt hit on yourself by your enemy. It is immersive.By the way, two opponent can hit/kill each other at the same time, sword of the one being hit 1 milisecond earlier does not lose inertia or momentum. One more risk to consider when disregarding defense.By adopting sensible EXP distribution, conquest gamemode encourages both team coorperative, brave intensive human waves clashing, objective oriented fight in Attacking phase, and also kill/death ratio matters, one life only objective oriented defending phase. Well balanced design in my mind.Devs are also addressing non-gameplay issues of this early access game quickly, I am no longer experiencing crash when quiting the game.Judging by every tiny detail of this game, the devs are a trustworthy group of fanatics. This game will prospher and long last. For M&B players, you need 1 week to adapt the new rhythm and some different mechanics, but foot works, distance control, feint and mind games are quite alike. Why not join now to get an edge in skill earlier to welcome the late coming friends."

All tho this early version of the game only shows us an unpolished version of the combat system and it has no stamina levels or mounted combat etc yet so it gets repetative very fast. The prizetag is also way to high for a game this early in development since they claim to make a full scale persistent MMO when the game is complete. I really hope the devs row this project to land and give it enough time and love to make a great MMO in the end. Therefore I will give this a thumbs up if you can ignore the pricetag!

The game mechanics are really good, it is always necessary to concentrate while fighting. Awareness is very important, also in winning combat against multiple enemies. It takes some time to get into this, probably less when you come from another game of the same genre, but the first levels are easily made.Of course it takes practices to get better in a skilled-based combat game. But I had most of the time fun playing this game, so skill develops without further notice.What I like most: There is no ""best weapon"". Different weapons simply offer differing playstyles. And if you know how to utilise them in certain situations, for example 1vs2, 1vs3, 2vs2, it gets even more interesting.I am really looking forward to new content, like crossbows, cavalry and features like The Epic.

When in the right angle, you'll block enemy attacks going for that angle and if you let go, you can swing.Because of this your and the enemy's character will look like they're actively trying to swing for weak spots, which makes it all the more immersive and predictable.Definitely looks like a skill-based game which is good, quicker handling of the mouse will result in your character telegraphing his moves less and being able to swing before your opponent can respond."

Granted there have been complications for the devs, it has been a work in progress.  However, actual multiplayer combat in this game when enough people are online is likely the best medieval combat system in any game.  It requires skill and effort to be good, what's more you cannot just run in swinging or rely solely on levels or a broken weapon that has an ungodly amount of reach.  If you are looking for realism and accuracy, look no further.  Will it be up and active in the next year or two, I cannot say, what I can say is that the devs have not at all given up or stopped working hard at it.

Yes it's true that the game servers have got a bit quieter recently due to lack of new content but that does't mean there is no new content. The devs have been really busy and have created a tonne of new features that are due to be implemented into the game late Dec 2016 in a big update instead of releasing lots of little ones. A lot of people don't understand that this game is ""early access"" and still has a some flaws that need ironed out. But by contributing to it now you also get a chance to help mould the game into it's final version and you also get a 1 up on all the new players that will join after the full game release. So, now that you know the reasons people are saying you shouldn't buy this game are false, let me tell you why you should buy this game.Firstly the combat system is one of the best I have encountered, (and it's not even finished). The fluidity and control over your weapon gives such a satifying fighting experience as if you are actally on the battlefield yourself. You can choose between a sword, axe, spear or bow, 2 handed or 1 handed and they all respond different requiring different techniques and skills.Secondly is the customisability. The amount of weapons and armour in the game at the moment is incredible, (and again it is far from being complete). Each weapon or armour item has it's own stats that will help you in specific battle situations, and it is up to you to decide which to choose. You can also upgrade your skills in HP, damage, attack and movement speed, each unique to your fighting style.The last point is maybe the most important, comradery. This is a team game and in the heat of battle you must rely on those beside you to watch your back. It is a great feeling running in to battle with your team by your side knowing that you have each other covered, no matter what happens. It is never every man (or woman) for himself, you fight and die together as a team. And right now while there are slightly less people online, that is multiplied by a thousand.I haven't even mentioned The Epic or the countless other features that the devs have in store for us as that would take you hours to read through, but you get the idea.Overall this is a medieval warfare game like never before, and it isn't even finished yet!!!"

It has similarities to what you'd find in Mount and Blade, but with a more organic and somewhat intuitive blocking system that can be easy to learn but difficult to master. I wasn't too much of a fan when it came to the larger battles, due to the poor performance and the swarms of players during this game's hype days.I'm not sure if the uproar from when the Epic was first tested is still around but I wouldn't pay too much attention to the drama. If I recall, the first test didn't go so well and really wasn't ready, which had led to the majority of the player base losing their minds over features not working completely in an Early Access game.At the moment, the most you will find is a partially populated duel server where players hone their fencing skills while unlocking the variety of gear that is currently available, which seems to be a pretty large selection.  I personally think this game has decent potentially as long as it's not mired with players who buy EA games, expecting a feature complete game that runs like butter.All in all, positive experience albeit the non-controversies but I wouldn't recommend buying it unless you completely understand what Early Access entails."

The idea is noteworthy though not fully realized, It is missing at least a medicum of lore and game mechanics that will keep this game from becoming a mass-slaughter of hackers and self-proclaimed bandits when it finally becomes decent enough for the public to take an interest in it once more (advice for developers: perhaps through a huge update and a sale? Maybe around summer and then another one during winter?)So here are some unbiased positives and negatives of the current version of the game:Pros:1) The combat is unique and it works2) Armour and weapons are superbly made (texture wise)3) The environment is well crafted with good atmosphere4) The graphics are great5) Frequent updates6) VERY, VERY good music selection (Very, very, very, very good)7) Has a lot of promiseCons:1) Slightly buggy (the developers are thankfully working on that)2) Not enough servers for decent multiplayer games (horrible ping for a multiplayer game)3) Does not have a Singleplayer mode (unforgivable)4) The Epic needs a lot of work5) Very demanding on the PC (hopefully, lower-end pc's will be able to work with the game once it is at later stages in completion... hopefully)The game would be decent - good even, if most of the bugs were fixed (they are working on it) and more servers were put up.I believe that putting this game out as early-access was a mistake. They should have finished the game first, then released and updated based on feedback. But there is no use crying over spilt milk...Overall, I would advise not to purchase the game at its current stage; however, do put it on your wishlists as when it is finally done - it will be worth checking out.I recommend this game for the future.Stay curious."

I would like to point out that this game is early access, and that the developers have specifically set out a development map/plan available for us to look at. The game released in late August, so it only makes sense that not many things below the ""early access"" line aren't yet included. Horses, squads, base-building, crossbows, spears, and more are specified to be released gradually after the early access release date. Some of these things have been added, while others have been complained about excessively. I think it's unfair to leave a bad review of a early access game because it isn't finished. That's absolutely stupid! Then people write horrible reviews, giving it a bad reputation, and complain more when no one plays the game!This game is going to be absolutely amazing when it comes out. It looks very good and runs extremely smoothly (unless there's a download in progress) and the concepts behind it that will be implemented are exclusive to this game. When this fully releases, it's going to be BIG.So please, leave a fair review, and buy the game! The more purchases and good reviews, the larger the player base gets, and the more the devs are encouraged to keep going. The quality of what has been released so far is a 9/10, and there are some HUGE maps to be released in The Epic mode eventually. Support this game, it's going to be awesome!"

Thus far, early access and all, it has the worst of M&B fighting, where you travel the same speed in all directions.  Most fights are people backing away and you walking forward, and they'll randomly step forward to swing and then back up again.I wish they'd take a page from War of the Roses or simply from real life where force comes from footwork, thus you have to step into swings, rather than casually backing across the entire map swinging at someone chasing you at the same speed.I kinda imagined a Braveheart battle, but it's slower-paced and doesn't let you tackle/impact others, so everyone moves slowly and mobs a player at a time.  You're either part of a bloodthirsty mob trying to hit a guy from all sides or you are that poor sucker waiting to die from an axe to the back of the head.M&B was great for the jousting, castle siege fights, etc.  This is the boring aspect, where it's fairly open and everyone just mobs and it's mostly luck and flailing."

I've played Mount and Blade Warband for hundreds of hours and I enjoyed it thoroughly.So I feel as if the team can really provide on their promises, regardly of how hopeless it looks now. I want this game to be what was promised and I trust it will, the dev team seems passtionate and willing to really take it home.

I would like to point out that this game is early access, and that the developers have specifically set out a development map/plan available for us to look at. The game released in late August, so it only makes sense that not many things below the ""early access"" line aren't yet included. Horses, squads, base-building, crossbows, spears, and more are specified to be released gradually after the early access release date. Some of these things have been added, while others have been complained about excessively. I think it's unfair to leave a bad review of a early access game because it isn't finished. That's absolutely stupid! Then people write horrible reviews, giving it a bad reputation, and complain more when no one plays the game!This game is going to be absolutely amazing when it comes out. It looks very good and runs extremely smoothly (unless there's a download in progress) and the concepts behind it that will be implemented are exclusive to this game. When this fully releases, it's going to be BIG.So please, leave a fair review, and buy the game! The more purchases and good reviews, the larger the player base gets, and the more the devs are encouraged to keep going. The quality of what has been released so far is a 9/10, and there are some HUGE maps to be released in The Epic mode eventually. Support this game, it's going to be awesome!I couldnt write it better myself, this game will be amazing once it is fully released."

That's right CLUNKIER than WAR OF THE ROSES.The game itself can not seem to decide if it wants to be realistic or arcadey and is trying to compromise between the two in the worst way possible. First of all you have 8 stances from which you can attack from. That's a pretty realistic mechanic and in theory is good, but in practice even just getting to a stance requires a level of technical mouse finesse that is beyond irritating.If the game is trying to be realistic it needs to really do some hard reworking. I was getting 360ed by a glaive.Additionally the block mechanic is good in theory, but because it is so irritating to get to the proper stance half of the blocks feel like random chance. The parries are even worse and I've yet to even see one be pulled off, much less do I know how to perform after reading ""Left click then right click"" a million times.If the game really went in, polished, and made the realism stand out it could be a good game. At the moment I can not recommend it and I'm deciding whether or not to get a refund."

In the duels you spawn in to an arena and challange other players to 1 on 1's. This is a good way to get your head around how the combat works in the game. I managed to have a few scuffles, and learnt the game enough to begin getting a few kills.Personally, I found the fighting mechanics to be quite clunky. The game relies on the movement of the mouse, while holding LMB, to block, and releasing the same button to aim and release the strike. This makes for slightly awkward combat and lacks the satisfication of similar games in this genre, such as Chivaly.After dueling I moved on to the 'Conquest' game type. A 'capture the flag' scenario that consitsof a flag in a central location. While I enjoed the scale of the battles, I found the gametype quickly became repitive, and still coudln't bring myself to enjoy the unrewarding combat elements.There were also a few crashes, mainly server errors that pushed me back to the title screen. However, on a few occasions the game did crash completely.I may check back with this game in a few months to see if it's been refined. For now,though, I can't imagine I will be investing much more time into it."

In this case, Chivalry (which I didnt like at all) and War of the Roses (which I thought was iconic but destroyed by neglecting anti cheat mechanics).Compared to WoTR or almost anything I know of from the last 5 years, it is very very ugly.  Graphics are just awful.The combat is really monotonous and lacks the same real feel of being there.  The fighting is linear and articially limited by a stop and start back and forth monotony.  No free flow between capture points/ obkectives. It literally spawns in one place in a boring map which is almost incidental to the gameplay.  Also bland in terms of environment.  Combat is central to the gameplay and the game seems to lack any real sense in terms of combat mechanics. For those who remember precise strikes to unarmoured or less armoured areas in WoTR. Forget it. If you hit or miss in KoM is almost irrelevant. Spam spam spam. You only know if you hit something because you see an XP message.  It is unforgivably bad.  It was aiming somewhere between chivalry spam based combat and the pure timing and War of the Roses detailed, skeleton based, armour based detail focus combat.  It got nowhere so far.The way you equip your character is poorly designed.My nearest analogy would be COD versus Battlefield.  (too tired to think of a medievel game analogy for that).So far the best thing about the game is the presentation. Particularly the music of the title screen.  Got me excited that this was a quality production. It may yet turn out to be but right now. NOPE.Bad stop start gameplay akin to US football versus European football.  Very Ugly Graphics on max settings. It really is terribly poor in almost every key way. It is like the devs never played war of the roses or any of those games which had a good foundation for medieval combat.Possibly, it has been released so far from unfinished, it is going to cut its own throat. A commerical suicide which is likely to turn out to be well deserved as it is hard to see how anyone could build on this to create something which would be woth time, let alone cash.My first time use of the refund button."

Unintereupted duels almost never happen; its either 5 of you hacking one of them down or five of them stabbing you to death; either way, blocking gets pretty pointless.Got a refund for now, will check it out again when its finished"

It promises you so much more then it actually gives you. You only have three game modes and epic mode doesn't work or you have to wait in a very very long load screen. In the other mode you are battleing with 100vs100 and you can't do anything without getting sliced in the back even by your own teamates. The combat system sucks, its set to were you only click the left mouse key to swing your weapon and you have to move the mouse in the direction you want it to swing making it rediculously hard to hit your target and the same thing for blocking, it gives you no time to block cause you have move your entire body in the direction the swing is coming from and its really buggy and won't go the correct direction 90% of the time and you cannot customize your combat system like in mount and blade.

,Not Recommended,430440,25140533,"Posted: 25 August, 2016",all,BiggCheese,"Ok, this will be a fairly long rant but here goes:The servers-I spent 30 minutes trying to connect to the servers (bear in mind Steam says you cannot have more than 2 hours in a game if you want a refund.) It's launch day, fair enough, but still. I joined the discord, apparently the devs said it would be fixed in 20 minutes (it wasn't) so I waited, when people asked when it would be ready, the devs went AFK, dodged questions and replied to other concerns, rather than the pressing matter, the awful connection. I decided to take this time to explore the gear and character customization options, there were what appears to be the bare bones of a skill tree and equipment selector. For example, there are 5 weapons available to the player from the get go, A 1 handed wooden club, a 1 handed axe, a 1 handed sword, a 2 handed polearm, and a bow and arrow. (You can apparently progress through this and unlock more types of these weapons, but I've yet to see what difference they will even make, considering the exact same animations and fighting style is used no matter what weapon you wield. The only difference I could see was range and slight damage modifiers. Some may argue that the club would clearly be better against armoured targets, sticking to the realism! But this brings me to my next point: The armour. There is 8 armour options available at the start. 3 types of helmets, a useless straw hat, and 2 almost identical mail coifs. 2 types of tunic, sleeved and unsleeved (No statistical difference what so ever), and 1 pair of pants. I didn't even check if the progression existed for these if I'm honest, as I'm sure it would make 0 difference in the long run.The Game-I finally managed to connect to a match. I soon learned, to my dismay, that every single player, was wearing the exact same white-ish gray tunic, and the only differences were that some wore the rounded coif, some wore the square, and some wore the straw hat. Other than that, and what weapon they used, everyone was identical. There is no way to change the colour of the tunics, and the only identifier between friend or foe is a miniscule white triangle above allies heads, which is easily lost amongst the sea of the white burlap excuses for apparel. In terms of combat, the system they designed seemed to improve upon the classic Warband system, in theory it was more advanced. But in reality, it's just the same old spamfest as usual. It was to be expected, but unless you're fighting a 1v1 duel against someone who is interested in a cinematic duel, all you'll see is people walking forward or backwards while spamming left slash or overhead. Archery is as to be expected from a game like this, just shoot at the swarm of serfs slashing at each other with what appears to be foam styled into the shape of medieval weaponry and hope that you get lucky. I've yet to mention that the game is sold as a ""Persistent Medieval War"" game. The main game mode, the only reason anyone bought this, is locked away, unfinished and unreleased to the public. And instead we were given this less than half-baked shocking PvP experience on stale maps with innane combat systems. ""The Epic"" as they call it, is supposed to be an enormous open map, in which players can build cities and settlements. However, as you may notice further down on the store page, city building is yet to be implemented. Infact, ""The Epic"" itself isn't implemented, however if you click the button on the menu, it doesn't give you a large notification stating ""This feature is yet to come!"" or some other jovial nonsense it instead takes you straight into the map. I found this fairly confusing, as I'd already seen on the discord that it wasn't in the game yet. But here, on the map, were Player Made settlements. However, the map itself seemed miniscule, and there was no way to spawn. So instead I tried to return to the menu, only for the game to crash, and I had to restart, only to be greeted by the blaringly loud, ear shattering ""Immersive"" menu song, about a man going to war or some other trivial horse♥♥♥♥♥♥that no one really cares about. I tried to turn it down in the audio settings, only to find that they didn't bloody work. I really can't be bothered writing anymore so I'll sum it up:TL;DR- This game has a slight bit of potential, but is completely wasted on false advertisement and pipe dreams, offering less than a quarter of what was promised in the steam trailer, what's worse, the fans eat it up and act as if this kind of behaviour is completely acceptable. (It isn't.) To tell you just how bad it is, it is barely better than a Digital Homicide title, and the only thing this launch reminds me of, is No Man's Sky, and we all know how great that game was, don't we?****EDIT****I was in one of the 100 vs 100 battles, I did play the game, that is why I am saying it's god awful currently and that people should save their money. Information regarding ""The Epic"" should've been on the front page of steam, telling people that it would not be available for release, and that if they were only buying it for that, they should save their money. Saying that ""the tunic is level 1 gear, everyone will look different eventually its just lvl1"" is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Are you telling me that the devs couldn't even be bothered to add a simple RGB slider to the gear options, or atleast make 1 team red or blue? Please stop trying to justify the lack of content on LAUNCH by saying it is an early access title and that the promised features will be released in due time. Because, as you may know, many early access titles promise similair things, and are never finished. (This is from the very top of the steam store page, the only thing about the game other than trailers that alot of 'gamers' would even look at.) ""Of Kings And Men is an independently developed, third-person multiplayer “Persistent Medieval War” game. "". Are you telling me that isn't lying? Not false advertisement? It is clearly being sold as something that it currently isn't. I shouldn't have to go dig through the website and a sea of text about the roadmap to find that the main feature isn't in the game. It should've been clearly stated on the store page, at the top. But, as you may have noticed......It isn't. You can defend EA trash all you want, but I'm here to inform people not to waste money on this currently. The 100 vs 100 combat was lacklustre, it consisted of everyone standing in the middle of a bland rocky hillside and spamming click at each other.  At first I thought the lack of blood in the game was a simple developer choice, but after seeing that every other part of the game was lacking I've realized it was likely that they could not be bothered to implement it.Also "" but progression is so clear you can change apperance after 2 hours or less"" This completely unnacceptable, considering they could've just added colour, instead they ask you to spend the remaining about of time that you didn't waste trying to connect to the awful servers, trying to get a different ♥♥♥♥ing hat or some other useless item.I understand that ""The Epic"" is launching in one week, I already stated that in the review, however, like i said, it's unnacceptable. It's like if overwatch only had it's skirmish mode on release, with only 1 character. It is complete and utter false advertisement. Also, you're telling me I should spend my free time, every waking moment, looking up extra info just to find out what state the game is on release? I checked the steam reviews, which were all positive. I watched the trailers, it seemed good enough. When I got in game I was greeted by unfunctional menu's and awful gameplay. Please, stop trying to defend this to me. Enjoy the game all you want, I'm not trying to stop you, but don't come to my review and try to persuade people that what I'm saying isn't the truth, because that makes YOU a liar too."

Never written a negative review but this game has some issues. You cant jump or crouch but you can kick? The objectives are literally a flag in the ground you stand on to capture. No real means of obtaining an objective to move on in the battle it just switches locations. I dont know maybe its just me but its way slower than Warband which is already slow in essence unless your on a hores... Also server issues which they are working on but I dont think I can recommend this game in its state.

The community is the most cancerous I've ever experienced. The balance is completely ♥♥♥♥ed. The game doesn't have enough players to fill a server. The 'elite' refuse to duel anyone but themselves for 10hours a day to fully learn all exploits. Everyone admits 2h is completely unbalanced but continues to use it. Filled with try hard King of exploits who actively encourage people to leave whohave any critique to make the game better, when the game can barely manage 20 v 20 (when a week ago it easily had 75 v 75).Have some complaints about the game (it's an alpha after all)? Then you 'need to learn to block' - it's the standard bs response because the tryhards are in love with the broken mechanics and don't want them to change. Lose in a duel to someone who plays all day? Then 'you can't block' despite beating other 'elite' players. Apparenty you can't critique the game unless you're a game dev yourself, because it's not as if critique is a fundamental requirement for art to be any good... The game is in no way close to HEMA or realistic.The devs aren't even able to fulfill their first week promises. The game needed tonnes more work before even EA, but I guess Bannerlord was coming out and they needed that quick cash... Another example of an EA cash grab.Original review: Great game, but combat has a lot of issues atm (edit, see below).OP: Not a perfect game, not a poor game, but a bloody fun game! Combat is a little clunky atm, sometimes I let go and my guy doesn't swing, but overall the combat is fun and rewarding. The online capture the flag mode is tonnes of fun. If this gets the backing it deserves then I can't wait to keep playing this into the future. The servers are struggling with the demand right now, but it should improve.Edit: Having played a bit more it's become clear that the base combat is fairly unbalanced atm, not only are hitboxes very off, the damage seems unfair (I've been hit twice and killed after hitting my foe 3/4 times before). The game needs a stamina meter, as at the moment people are just running around 2 handing the most powerful weapons and constantly attacking, not much you can do to fight back just now - and very unfair when those weapons have to be unlocked after hours of play - a stamina meter would balance this aspect and weapon damage far more fairly. Also the two handed sword is very op, you just keep swinging with it and you will kill 4-10 people per life - I've seen guys take on 6 or so enemies at a time no problem with this weapon. Still a really fun game, but the combat still needs a lot of balance."

Medieval game, good mechanics, plans for the future and a great develop team that listens to what the community says.Some people might not think it was worth paying 25 euroes for this game, I would say it is definitely worth my money.9/10, waiting for it to get even further in its development."

I'd suggest looking at the updates to see whats changed cuz the game has definitly improved since its release a year back.
