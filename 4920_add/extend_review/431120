,Recommended,431120,30231590,Posted: 27 February,all,SKΛTΞºʳÐ¡Ξ☠  [222],"I know I can't be the only person that wants a VR version ""Black & White"".This game seems very much like an RTS Survival.  You meticulously collect ""Spirit Energy"" one at a time from dead enemies or at random.  (Just think of it as sunshine in PvZ.)  The first level requires 320 Spirit Energy or something like that.  That's when you have to survive the night.  I put up a defense tower that uses Stone resource as ammo.This game is very well-made.  The tutorial and everything is easy to read.The tutorial takes 30-40 minutes.  About 80% through the tutorial they said,  ""That's it, that's all you need to know.""  (or something along those lines.)  So I quit to menu expecting Level 1 to be unlocked.  NOPE!!  LOL  I had to do the tutorial TWICE.  (FML)I can comfortably play this game seated with motion controls.  (They allow you to use Xbox controller too.)It's definitely worth the pricepoint.When the ""Peeps"" build a house.  There's this sort of ""Pixel Magic"" that comes down from the sky.  It's really cool.  Ironically, it reminds me of the startup screen to BLACK & WHITE!!  (shake a box with little pixel cubes inside.)Only gripe is sometimes you'll tether a soldier unit to an enemy and they'll pickup a resource instead.  So navigating the camera is crucial.You also work with elements of clouds.  Mix Rain with Snow and get a thunderstorm and drag clouds to enemies.  You can take snow and freeze a river.  Use a tornado and make Peeps teleport to their destination.  It all adds a twist.The game is really good.  I've tried lots of other VR games and they just aren't up to par with Black & White.  Tethered really scratches that itch.I ended up with mass suicide because they were hungry.  But I was so busy fighting monsters.  So yeah lots of trial and error.  Good thing it's a really relaxing game and it's hard to get angry."

If you loved God games of yore like Black & White, Populous, Cultures, or some of the early Settlers games, you will feel at home. The controls are quite simple. (On HTC Vive) You use grips to move the world around and triggers/ thumbpad to ""tether"" your Norn-like peeps to resources and buildings.  The weather plays an important part in controlling production, access, defense, and healing.In order to complete each world, you need to gather Spirit Essence to wake the island's guardian. This requires reeling in floating orbs before they expire, which you will do whenever you are not managing your peep's orders. The game is somewhat slow-paced, but I found I had little down time as there was always something to attend to.Game runs smoothly on my i7-6700k and GTX 970. There were a couple framerate issues on load or when the building triangles are swirling around the camera, but during normal play I did not have any stuttering or issues.Overall a wonderful game and I am so happy Secret Sorcery brought this to PC!"

Besides these little inconveniences I think the game has a ton of potential and is probably one of the best visual VR games I've played (and I've played too many)"

I enjoyed the Black & White games in their time, and I'd strongly encourage other fans of the series (or any similar) to give Tethered a try.The movement controls seemed a bit strange at first, but felt very smooth and natural after only a few minutes of messing around.  Otherwise, this game is beautiful and well-polished...easily one of the best looking games on the Vive at the moment, and the ""peeps"" are absolutely adorable!  The game runs smoothly on my i7-3770k/gtx 980 system, with no apparent glitches or dropped frames.One minor issue for me was that the hand assignment (right/left) seems to be reversed from the Vive controllers' expectations.  It threw me off at first, but swapping the controllers physically was a simple enough workaround."

It is as good as I was expecting, if not better. It looks really stunning and I dont have a very good graphics card. It's a really fun strategy game that just eats up your time - I can't stop playing it. The music is really cool as well - I kind of wish I had bought the deluxe pack now so I had the soundtrack. I think it is really clever how they have used the 'look at' pointing mechanic even in the non-VR version - it totally makes sense when you play the game, and I think it would not have had quite the same direct fun feeling if they had changed the controls to something different.I would definitely recommend this game, and I was really lucky that at the same time it got the patch to make it playable without a VR headset it was also in the sale!! Very happy!"

Ya, short time playing so far, but thats VR.Point being there are tons of islands and I have only touch 2 of them so far! Great God Game and as mentioned a full game, kudos to the devs on this one! If you like the genre BUY IT NOW! that's if you have VR of course ;) Oh this is on Vive, OCR is being supported it seems by the devs, look to the forums, but for Vive it was easy as pie ;)Things I liked...1. The creatures are cute as a button!2. Graphics are very nice3. Sound and music are just great!4. Game play is solid and I love building up my villages on the islands5. Weather control is fun stuff !6. Feeling like a god is pretty cool in this game , even the little guys look at you when you get close7. There is combat for your little ones (night monsters)8.  Allot of building options9. Allot of promotional options for your peeps.10. Just overall a great experiance.What I didn't really care for....1. Movement controls are a bit wonky for me2. Popups to explain things are nice, some pop up thou and sometimes i would have diffculty removing them. Finally got it thou, just wasn't explained well.3. Save , but they are coming with something on that.4. Fast pace, I mean it's like any real time god game, but in this, being VR, have some sort of ""Slow"" god power would be nice, I thought about pause, but that would break the emmerision. But great news on this one too , like save they are adding a time control update soon so sweet! :)Summary:Loved it , recommend it, will play allot more in future!"

Lovely art and audio, simple intuitive interface, and thoughtful strategy design. I only played through the tutorial, but it looks like there's hours of content to chew on.You can freely scale and move the floating island. This is awesome because you can perfectly fit it inside you room bounds and then playing it as a roomscale model without needing to change viewpoints. However, sometimes the viewpoint autochanges and I had to reposition the island for roomscale again. There's also cloud hotspots that you quickly hop between if you're playing with a standing only setup. It looks like there's also gamepad controls if you're playing seated, but I didn't try them."

The music is great without being overwhelming, the environments are simple but polished and beautiful, and I haven't had a single issue yet (6700k w/1070). This game hearkens back to classic base-management RTS games, and does it well. The tutorial mission is super clear and really cleared up all the questions I had about the user interface.Oh, and don't forget to collect spirit energy in the tutorial! (I totally wasn't paying attention to it so the tutorial took me forever).Long story short, probably the first game for steamVR where I thought ""This is worth the asking price."" Don't feel like you have to wait for a sale if you're thinking about it, it's worth $25!"
76561198303758838,Recommended,431120,30328347,Posted: 4 March,all,UnReasonAble,"So good to see fully fleshed out games with game mechanics that don't get boring in 15 minutes.  I normally get bored of most games and end up switching between several before giving up, but this one had me playing until my temples started hurting (really need that deluxe strap!)  Controlling the little guys is fun and apealing, the art style and graphics are a perfect fit for the game.  The upgrade  and gathering mechanics are deep enough to not be just a chore, and the enemies are just enough of a challenge to keep it interesting longer term.That said, the controls could use some work. The main mechanic, tethering, would be better suited to the trigger.  Finding and clicking on a specific Peep is a pain sometimes, especially finding and using certain professions.  There isn't enough feedback in the game to show you what something does.  Things like the wood piles could easily have numbers over them to show you the stock, but you have to go to an info panel.  Finding your warriors and getting them to attack is cumbersome.  Menus often block your view and follow you around and sometimes cannot be dismissed.  Also, during the tutorial, I had menus inside objects, the ground, and the clouds so I couldn't read what they said and had to guess how to proceed.I hope the developers continue to fine-tune the game, but even with it's warts, it's still one of the best non-shooter games out there."

At merely 23 eur, this game is a steal. It actually has a lot of content, quite an in depth gameplay, and it's built from ground up for VR and is actually capitalising upon it's VR nature in all the best ways. And the visuals are just beautiful."
76561197993703914,Not Recommended,431120,33740478,Posted: 23 July,all,Primate,"This is a really polished game visually, which is what initially drew me. However after playing it for several hours I haven't found much enjoyment, but much tedium.This is a very casual RTS with most of its gameplay revolving around mechanics like resource collection and management and unit micromanagement. All of these mechanics are implemented here in a very rudimentary manner, to its detriment. The game is based around fulfiling objectives in which a day night cycle exists. By day you have your units engage in productive behaviour, but at night enemies spawn and attack and you must fend them off. The controls and UI are atrocious, with every task requiring far too many clicks. I say clicks because though the game was supposedly designed around VR, the controllers are used as little more than a pointer emulating traditional mouse control. Here are a few examples of simple UI problems that plague the game:-You cannot order a unit to move to an arbitrary area. Instead you must tell it to go to one of a few specific places on the map. If there's a low health unit under attack, you can't just tell it to move away, instead you must tell it to go to one of a few predefined areas. If the direction you'd like to head in doesn't have a point of interest, you can't move there.-You cannot order units to do a task en masse. This is something you will want to do frequently. If you have five units you all want to do the same task, you must tell each one individually to do that task.-Combat usually involves having all your units gang up on enemies. Once they're all standing together, it's extremely difficult to pick out any one unit because pointing at something with your controller is fundamentally less accurate than with a mouse cursor, which the controllers try to emulate.Everything is overly simple so there is little to no thought you need to put into your actions. Harvest resources, make structures, and tell everyone to kill the enemies at night one by one. However, you will constantly be doing things because the game loves to make you micromanage. The level of micromanagement expected is not fun, just dull. Telling three people to do one task over several clicks isn't fun gameplay, it's just busywork. Sending weather clouds to resource nodes because they're depleted doesn't really require any decision making, it's just a thing to do. Constantly - and I do mean constantly - holding down a button or grabbing the resources you need to complete levels as they float above the land is among one of the most mindless mechanics in a game ever. None of these things are remotely engaging or require any thought or strategy, they're just things you have to do to progress the game. Unfortunately, most of the gameplay doesn't rise past this level of banality.There are some good things about this game. It runs well, the visuals are excellent, and it has a cute, kid-friendly design. However, the gameplay doesn't live up to the rest of this game's level of polish."

76561198014872367,Recommended,431120,31406890,Posted: 27 April,all,kees,"Awesome game! I really hope for more games like this in VR.My only complaint thus far is that the game has a LOT of content which goes unused. There are all sorts of buildings, building upgrades, and Peep upgrades which are not really necessary to ever use.I'm rank #1 on the leaderboard for several maps (I plan to be #1 on all the maps very soon) and I did it with using very basic building options (Workshop, Corn Farm, Temples). No need for Barracks, Towers, or really anything else... you are best off using only 10% of the content in this game and ignoring the other 90%. I wish this wasn't the case. :(Some suggestions to fix this:1) There should be a better building 'progression' in the game. What I mean by this is, building upgrades should cost more but offer a higher reward. The game should, as you progress through the level, be so difficult that it requires you to use building upgrades. You shouldn't be able to coast through the entire game just by sticking to the basics. (Please see other RTS for examples.)2) There should be external factors which might force you to build a certain way, like paper/rock/scissors sorts of scenarios. (Note other RTS games often use this paper/rock/scissors model. Think ""Anti-aircraft towers"" in games like Command and Conquer or Warcraft, which are used against air units.) Basic changes to the creeps could help in fixing this issue. How about some creeps which can only be killed with a hero, or other creeps which require a tower to kill?3) Every building in the game should be compared to a Temple. ""Is this building going to help me (achieve my end goal) more than building another temple?"" (Most of the time that answer is no.) Either temples need to be nerfed or other buildings need to get buffed.4) Any building which gives a temporary buff (e.g. running boots, armor, grenades) should give the buff instantly to the Peep rather than consuming valuable time to receive that buff. Most of the time the buff just isn't worth the time and resources invested into getting it for that one peep. (Maybe the buildings should hand out the buffs automatically (on a cooldown), instead of force the peep to move to the building.) TBH, using the Frost Clouds to buff Peep armor is often times better than using it on anything else... which negates the need for the Armor building.Anyway... I'm still having a lot of fun with the game and will keep playing. One of the most fun games I've played thus far in VR. Thank you very much for making it and I really hope for a sequel!"

If you've ever played Black & White, Tethered is essential a sprititual successor for VR. So far I've played through the first 4 islands, and the maps are well thought out and polished. The controls are inutitive and easy to use, and the game mechanics are fun while remaining challenging the further along you get. It's a refreshing use of VR in a market currently saturated with shooters, slashers, and spaceships.I would also add that, of the VR games I've played so far, Tehtered is by far one of the most complete. This is not one of those half finished indie games that is essentially a mini-game masquerading as something more, it's a fully fleshed out game. I would expect the first run through to take anywhere from 7-12 hours, with a high amount of replayability, especially if you want to see just how well you can do completing a level."

The game is a series of islands, which can be rotated and resized with the grip buttons (there are also options for fixed view points around each island).  The game is composed of managing jobs for your peeps that arrive on the island in eggs, which you have to hatch, then assign them work collecting resources that will either feed the population, or enable them to construct new buildings or upgrade themselves.  Clouds will also randomly appear during the game and can be consumed by something to change it's state e.g. you can assign a rain cloud to some woods to replenish the trees, or snow to a lake to temporarily freeze it, or combine clouds for more powerful effects. The game has a day/night phase, where slugs come out during the night-time to kill your peeps or comsume your resources, but destroying the slugs is also a major source of crystal power that you need to complete each level."

The Vive adds nothing to this style of game. The relaxing nature of it is hindered by the constant standing in the Vive, and the gorgeous graphics are ruined by first generation pixelated HMDs. Without constant movement, the graphics simply cannot be truly appreciated, and this game simply doesn't have you looking around much.

I enjoy it and I revisit the game to try to better my fastest time. The game is well made, very polished, and fun. If you enjoy RTS games then I completely recommend that you at least try this game. You can enjoy it in VR or on a 2d screen. I have never played it on a 2d screen but I dont think one way is more enjoyable than another. I hope they may a Tethered 2 with more cools features soon."

The reason I say that is because the thrill of selecting multiple units at once and sending them into battle is distinctly absent. This is not a game where you can compose a nuanced army and break down an enemy base.However, it is an entirely unique, addictive and fun game that requires very quick work in order to ""get good grades"" according to the game. I was a gold league Starcraft 2 player and relatively competent at Age of Empires, but this is definitely a new beast. While it is not challenging to survive any level so far in the campaign, the game will remind you that you did poorly with a smattering of E grades. Still, it's so much fun to hatch new Peeps build a good variety of buildings to ultimately harness spirit energy, and manage battle tactics.I find myself wishing I could fight more types of enemies than just grubs/slugs of various colors and sizes, but that is clearly not where the focus of this game lies. And that's ok! There is certainly a lot of content here that will keep you playing well past 10 hours, but as a player of fast-paced PC RTS games through the ages, I'm not quite bursting with excitement when I play Tethered, just quite focused and enthralled.GOOD BUY. 9/10.

As and RTS game is empty and repetitive, there are no many relevant options and you basically have to build one or two buildings of certain type to win. Very relevantly: there is no continuous gaming option, so you only get to ""play god"" for a little, fairly stressful time, and don´t get to see the results of your good management: It would be nice, after the level is done, to have the chance to sit back and relax, just adjusting things here and there, and spend some time watching the little guys do their stuff, which is the most beautiful aspect of this game.

,Not Recommended,431120,33694862,Posted: 21 July,all,Drew Peacock,"Nah. Fun for a 15 mins. This sort of game is best played not in VR. I didn't feel being in VR added to the experience. Some immersiveness yes, but ultimately it was a standing in one place, pressing buttons game. I think this is best done with mouse and keyboard.  Nice idea though and the graphics were very nice."

This will be right up your alley.You are god that controls his people. You can direct weather, create buildings , harvest resources and even specialize your followers into a profession of your liking.. You tell them to do it and they listen. I only played the tutorial so far and can tell it's going to be a blast.  Word of advise even when the tutorial says well thats all we got, don't leave the game. I left and it still said I needed to complete the tutorial to play any other modes / worlds. Which sucks because it was about 30 minutes long."

Much more complex than expected and that the video conveys...there's a host of building, roles for the ""peeps"", and requires a lot of juggling. Love it."

,Not Recommended,431120,30370405,Posted: 7 March,all,Senatic,"Bought this game on the recommendations of the reviews, boy was that a mistake. The games resolution is so so low you can't even read the tutorial messages even if they're almost in your face. And with no super sampling options and steam vr super sampling not working for this game it means it is basically unplayable. Previous reviewers talks about the super cute peeps and fun gameplay. I wouldn't know about that since barely possible to make out the peeps from their pixalated outlines.A quick dive into the forum will show you several users with this issue over the past week and no response from the devs. Apparently on the oculus debug tool there is a way to force super sampling, but I can't try that since I have a HTC Vive.This is a instant refund for me."

The game is super fun, very playable seated. Controls are almost perfect, with two exceptions: a) the action button is actually a 'fire' button not the one on touchpad, and b) the world dragging could be little bit faster, but it's just my preference. Graphically it looks amazing. Sound is nice and peeps are super cute :)"

That’s an absolute tragedy with a product this good.Let’s hope they get a bit more proactive on that because I really want to see what this team produce next! I’d hate to see them fail due to having poor public relations, help them out and spread the word on these guys! Tell people to buy their game!I really can’t recommend this game enough.The game made me feel like I was playing something made by Bullfrog or early Lionhead. It brought back a feeling of enjoyment in strategy games I haven’t felt in years. Buy their game. Buy it twice if you can!Also, it’s in VR! It works extremely well and was the first experience in VR where I really just sat and played for hours and enjoyed myself.The design team should be extremely proud of what they’ve made.Thank you @SecretSorcery !"

(if that doesn't grab your attention i don't know what to do) Yes this game. if you ignore one of these little guys too long he will become depressed, he will become suicidal and walk to the edge of a cliff and if you  don't make him a rainbow he will jump screaming the whole way down.  it's not graphic he just fades into the clouds as  he falls but it was rather jaring to watch if your not expecting it. so keep that in mind before you give this to a kid to play."

76561197997794666,Recommended,431120,30309330,Posted: 3 March,all,Tikigod,"This is a very polished game.  Quality made VR title.  It looks and feels finished and is something you can actually play for a long period of time.   These sort of titles are hit or miss when you see screenshots.  The animations and scenery have alot of detail and you can zoom in and out to whatever size you want.  So, you can either explore the creatures at eye level like you are the same size as them, or shrink it down to where they almost look like ants, just by pulling or pushing your hands together.  It looks like a living breathing minature world.  This is a very unique title and brings a whole new gaming style to VR.   Even though the underlying theme in the game is pushing a save the planet hippy tree hugging idealogy...I really like the quality of the animations and time the developers put into the details of this game.   I highly recommend this title for anyone's collection."

,Recommended,431120,35271423,Posted: 28 September,all,Trebla7th,"This is the type of game I was looking for, it's not a ""Game that shows off VR"" it's a ""Fun game (if you like the genre) that was adapted to work well in VR.""  Certainly I have minor complaints, it's not perfect, but the premise is similar to any number of other games with a reasonably nice VR interface.If you're like me, you bought a Vive not for ""VR Games"" but for ""Games you can play in VR"", this fits the bill."
