76561197989528524,Not Recommended,431230,22041569,"Posted: 25 March, 2016",all,Dragon,"With quite a lot more effort Tiny Guardians could become a very good game.  As it stands it's a mobile port (which I knew) but a badly polished one (which I didn't know).It's a tower defense game game without the towers.  A hero defense game unlike Defense of the Ancients.  When under attack by a wave the hero loses the ability to move, becoming a 'hero tower', but gains the ability to summon defenders who can be moved within a limited range.None of the above is bad and along with the heavilly Kingdom Rush inspired graphics Tiny Guardians has happy cute feel to it.The probelm is in the port / implementation.  Everything is slide this, tap that.  If you want to summon a unit there is no right click wheel that can be popped up where you want the unit.  Instead click and drag the summoned units card to where you want them.  It's possible to click a card and then click where you want to summon the defender but this doesn't always work.  Not a show stopper but subtly annoying.Upgrading units is the same.  There is no context wheel for a unit, instead there is an upgrade card that must be dragged, not dragged anywhere in particular, just dragged.  Then the unit upgrades.   Moving too: click a unit and then drag the unit to where you want them, not select and click where you want them because again, the command is mostly ignored but not always.  All of this could have been better and with all little annoyances I started losing interest.The game is slow, both in terms of unit movement and play style.  I found my mind wandering whilst waiting for my units to mop up various groups of baddies.  Playing the game on harder modes doesn't really help as increasing the difficulty increases enemy health but doesn't allow for more skilful play.It's not possible to select a unit behind another unit - including the hero.  This would have been a problem only if there was more than minimal control over summoned units.  When moving a unit out of harms way or into a healing circle they'll either not move at all or walk right back to where they were originally.  And this is assuming the screen doesn't inadvertently scroll whilst trying to drag a unit around.On the other hand there is so little need for interaction (except during the tedious slogs that are boss fights) that not being able to micro manage units is not a real problem.Lastly and most annoyingly Tiny Guardians has a number of techincal issues.  Sound and music don't work (at least not for me).  The maximum resolution is 1920x1200, lower than my monitors resolution.  Menus are unresponsive and toggle states get confused.  And enemies become passive and invulnerable effectively requiring a stage restart.I can't recommend Tiny Guardians without an overhaul, I suspect this is a great time waster on mobile devices but it's failed to transistion to PCs.  Buy this is you like Kingdom Rush style art or want to support the developer but otherwise avoid."

Not to mention slow.Additionally the 'challenge' mode doesnt actually add any level of difficulty as the only actual way to do these missions is to over level past them and unlock the spamable heals and damaging spells.Not a good game, maybe worth £1.99 on mobile, no way its worth £7 on PC. Refunded."
76561197992229015,Not Recommended,431230,28733953,"Posted: 27 December, 2016",all,Dire,"Do you like games like Kingdom Rush but want something a bit different? Tiny Guardians promises just that. Instead of building towers along a lane and controlling 1 hero, you are following your hero through the lane while controlling up to 6 guardians of various classes. Sounds good so far, yet the execution and actual game play and tactics are pretty lacking, unfortunately.Let's start off with the guardians:All in all there are 12 guardians available over 4 different classes (Warrior, Range, Magic and Stealth). These ""classes"" can be upgraded with stars you earn from beating levels (up to 3) and challenges. These can also be upgraded several times during battle. Each hero and upgrade costs resources that are earned by killing enemies. If you want more heroes that will also cost ever more resources. Higher Tier heroes cost more resources to deploy and upgrade.Tier 1, which you unlock in the first few missions (Knight, Archer, Magician and Rogue) are actually pretty good for most of the game. The Knight is a sturdy tank with a stun, the Archer a ranged DD with good DPS, the Rogue a hybrid melee/ranged DD, who's not really all that necessary, and, what I found to be THE bread and butter hero in the game: The Magician, the only one who can dish out reliable AOE damage with each shot, slows enemies and causes massive aoe damage every few seconds with her spells. Seriously, this unit is so overpowered that building nothing but Magicians with maybe 1 tank (and later a healer) is enough to destroy most enemy waves. Of course they are fragile, but who cares if the enemies are often dead before they even reach you.Tier 2 heroes (Berserker, Hunter, Cleric and Assassin) unlock gradually in the mid to later levels. The Berserker is a moderately ok unit with an AOE special, more HP, but less Defense than the Knight, so I never really used him. The Hunter deals a bit more damage than the Archer, but is slower and has a crappy special ability, yet you ABSOLUTELY NEED her for 5 or 6 levels, because she is the only one who can spot stealthed enemies and traps, which can deal tons of damage. So it's kind of annoying that she gets shoehorned in there like that. The Cleric is a dedicated group healer, but only after being upgraded once in battle. She is essential later on, unfortunately. The Assassin is a melee crit damage dealer with quick attack speed, but is weak without the expensive upgrades.Tier 3 is where the game loses ANY appeal whatsoever, however. These heroes can ONLY be unlocked with the ingame premium currency ""coins"". I assume that in the mobile version (yes, this is a port), these could be purchased for real money. Here you get coins after every mission or so. If you just stick to the main campaign (about 14 missions I think) you should be able to unlock ONE of them about half way or 2/3s through the campaign. That is if you want to play with the Paladin or the Sentinel, which cost 8 coins. The Wizard costs 12 and the Dancer a WHOPPING 20 coins, which means you will be grinding challenge missions for quite a while (artificially lengthening the game). Challenges force you to play a map with no reviving heroes, only certain types of heroes, a maximum of x upgrades or just at a higher difficulty (always a combination of 3), which makes a victory anything but certain. This is unacceptable in a SP game for which you pay full price. Moreover you have only a vague idea of what each hero does until you unlock or deploy them. Only then is the entry readable, so you could be saving 20 coins for the Dancer, hoping to unlock the most powerful hero (because it's the most expensive), only to find yourself with a hero you won't ever use. Personally I unlocked the Pally, which is just a better Knight with a heal instead of a stun, but also twice as expensive almost. Deals a lot more damage as well, but I've heard the Sentinel and Dancer are a waste of time and the Wizard is supposedly a Fire AOE mage. I'm fine with my discount Ice mage though. I assume the Wizard is too expensive to effectively use anyway.Which brings me to my next point: At least on the 1st difficulty setting Tier 2 and 3 heroes are just not good enough to warrant the expensive upgrades. I usually just went with 1 Paladin, 1 Cleric, maybe 1 Assassin and 1-3 Magicians in the end, upgraded the first 3 once to get their special abilities and then just focussed on the Magicians (not in that order). What point is there to include all these options if there's no viability and the game is not balanced? I'd rather have a Level 5 Magician than a Level 2 Paladin for kinda the same price. This is one just one of the flaws of the game.Next up, enemy variety:A new type of enemy gets introduced with each level. Basically these are for the most part mildly interesting and fun, but also pretty standard, apart from the carnies. Nothing you haven't seen anywhere else before. There are also a handful of bosses, which are just super annoying, but we'll get to that later.Levels:Not too many and nothing interesting. Why you traverse the levels instead of just standing there and waiting for enemies? Cause the game says so, but it doesn't make a difference. In other TD games the level plays a vital role in your strategy. The only tactical decision here is ""take a Hunter or an Archer?"" based on the enemies in the levels (mid section of the game). Shame.Graphics, Sound, Music:Decent flash graphics, ok sound, subjectively ok music, but gets repetitive.Controls:The best for last...*sigh*. The game was clearly designed for mobile users. Heroes are controlled exclusively via drag-and-drop. Same goes for upgrading them. For the most part this is ""ok"", but in any case really obnoxious and irritating. Maybe assigning each hero a number key or just changing the whole pace of the game in general might have been a good idea, I don't know. I can clearly see how on higher difficulties the slow input could be a real problem. The controls aren't too precise either. Especially in boss fights you need pretty insane reaction times to hope to avoid the boss abilities. Speaking of boss battles: ♥♥♥♥ me, are they boring and bland. You basically just fight a tough enemy with an insane HP pool, who regularly charges you and then ""leaves"" the battlefield to ""bombard"" you from afar. EVERY boss does this, they all follow the same pattern with various variations. I've beaten them all on easy, but some of those abilities ONESHOT your heroes (especially the Troll Warlord!) and you can often not even avoid them, because your heroes are too slow and you're already being hindered by the clunky control scheme. Big no!All in all the game is not worth the price of admission for barely 4 hours of gameplay in my opinion. And also pretty much a waste of time. It's not particularly fun, offers little new and doesn't even have any semblance of a story. For the most part it's: Build x and y, upgrade, win, continue. It could have been something better, but it isn't."

,Recommended,431230,23810351,"Posted: 25 June, 2016",all,reaia,"Having only played 2.9hrs of the game, my opinion may not be as viable. However, I have enjoyed all 2.9hrs of it(I've always enjoyed tower defence games as well as collecting/unlocking items - in this case Guardians-so that may be a reason). I do understand why many people would say that it isn't challenging enough even with the increase in difficulty as I can see that happening late game once everything has been fully upgraded and unlocked as it's a common theme in tower defense games I've played.Visually, Tiny Guardians is aesthetically pleasing in a cute-chibi kind of way (even the mobs) - this being one of the reasons which made this game catch my eye at first. The controls are simple once you get used to having to drag things round (I guess on the mobile platform it is easier through usage of the touch screen). The ability to use both summoner spells and to move Guardians to better placements ensures that you will something to do whilst waiting for the wave to end.Originally I thought Tiny Guardians would just be a time filler or something to play when I'm bored-surprisingly I now see myself looking forward to play this game and not using it as a time-filler. I'd probably say for £7,it isn't really worth it(as much as I love this game), so be sure to buy it when it's on sale.I'm looking forward to any future updates of new classes, mobs, features and levels. ^-^"

For some reason none of my units can attack it, but that thing can attack them. So i end up watching that small jumpy mob and hearing that annoying sound attacking my units until death and then revived and then died again."
,Recommended,431230,22494558,"Posted: 18 April, 2016",all,YORHA♡12S,"Tiny Guardians is a fun and cute game. The only problem that I see with it is that the story is a short one. It's clear from the gameplay that it's a mobile-port, where you have to click and drag cards to summon your tiny guardians (so that's where the title comes from! lol jkjk ) to defend the summoner, little Lunalie.You can breeze through the story with easy-mode, but it's all up to you if you want to go easy, normal, or hard! I've found myself entertained by each level and sometimes aggravated due to small mistakes here and there that end up giving me a game over. But I find that learning from those mistakes adds to the fun of games such as these.So will you help little Lunalie's quest to find her friend? Or will you leave the poor little girl by her lonesome?"

Which means if you're using a touchpad it gets very frustrating very quickly. If they ever put in an option to switch from drag and drop to point and click it'd be more friendly to all versions2nd The game is much cheaper with the phone version.So if you can overlook or work around those to things then THIS GAME IS PRETTY DARN GOOD.
76561198027994280,Recommended,431230,28425446,"Posted: 17 December, 2016",all,Ismaru,"Tiny Guardians offers an unique take on the Tower Defense genre by making the player walk in the lane. It's a lot of fun!Pro'sYou actually walk down a path, with baddies trying to stop you. It's an inverse TD!The game remains very dynamic because you're (almost constantly) moving, giving you interesting defence choicesDiverse roster of defenders, allowing various mix-upsIt has cute and quirky graphics!ConsIt's a bit easy. I started out on hard mode, but swapped down to normal mode after maps started taking 2-3 tries each. I finished the game under 4 hours, so that's quite fast in my opinion. But then again, there are definitely some interesting replay options (challenge modes), but they just didn't really appeal to me.Ranged characters are a bit problematic. They do OK to good damage, but if someone comes into melee range they are worthless and of course very easily killed. I often struggled to have a melee character tank and having ranged stay at the back, especially with enemies coming from all sides.You can upgrade units, but it never felt like it had a real impact.All in all it was a short, but fun experience, and a refreshing breeze in TD games I've played!Was this review useful to you?Please check out the Izzy Reviews Curator pagefor regular updates on reviews for other games!"
,Recommended,431230,33789748,Posted: 25 July,all,Salarn,https://youtu.be/xGCjC0lFAdgNot exactly a tower defense game or even a 'reverse' tower defense game.  'Tiny Guardians' takes the road less traveled by allow players to summon a band of adventurers to quest through it's various levels.  This fresh take is well done and adds in additional tweaks such as enemies hiding in bushes and boss fights that require skilled positioning.

Usually tower defense games are about zergs of mobs gunning for your ""base"". They don't do that in this game. They 95% of them gun for everyone but your ""base"" until they run out of targets to aggro on.The class designs are cool and enemies are too.If I was to say anything negative for the game is that it felt too easy. I only played normal mode (except for the boss challenges that play on hard). Also the maps could of had more variety in mobs for each map. (one section of the game is about being zerged, another section is about a few high damage threats, another just have high hp mobs that are slow to kill).I got 15 hours out of it to beat it. I didn't do the bonus missions though at the end."
