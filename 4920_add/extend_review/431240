I understand the need to be able to kick a player due to ping problems or language however, this feature seems to get abused by hosts more often than used for its intended purposes. If you decide to join a random lobby instead of creating your own or playing with your friends, you better not be beating the host or you'll probably be kicked. Taking to long to line up your shots? You're probably gone.

,Recommended,431240,23283936,"Posted: 29 May, 2016",all,Stukas Over Disneyland,"10/10 Golf with your Friends is honestly worthy of GOTY. Here's why;Music: The music is mind-blowing for lack of better words. It is capable of giving you a wide arrange of fealings from happiness to legitimate depression and agony. I would absolutely recommend turning it up to max as you enjoy/scream through your game of Mini-Golf with your friends. The composer has truely accomplished a feat with the one repeating song that plays throughout the entire game.Physics: The physics in this game are surprisingly realistic and fair. That is, unless you change them so you're on the moon. Which brings me to my next point.Options/Customization: Do you not like your white ball? Change it to hot pink! Not like that you can't collide with your friends? Make it so you can! Not like the gravity? Drag a bar and take a trip to Mars! Not like being in 3rd Person? Use the scroll wheel to go into 1st Person mode! I was actually surprised with the amount of things you could change in this game, which is actually cheaper than the average sandwhich. Use that logic to convince your friends to buy this game so you don't have to play it by yourself. Trust me, It worked for me.Overall Graphics: For an early access game this is top tier. Honestly. The screenshots aren't cutscenes, there actually aren't any cutscenes in this game, I mean it's mini-golf why would there be? All the screenshots are in game footage. Crazy huh?It's Balanced: All the courses in this game are very well balanced, which suprised me since this is a golfing game. (aside for the ones you can access by turning on beta content, those need some work. Like ffs the Twilight map is hard af)Blacklight Interactive has done something spectacular with this game and I cannot wait for the Bogey Boy DLC. Great work guys."

With that said, I feel multiplayer in this game is rather lacking. Golf with your friends doesn't provide a dedicated matchmaking system. It does, however, grant you the option to create custom lobbies effortlessly.SummaryOverall, Golf With Your Friends is a solid game that is best played with others to maximize your entertainment. It contains an excellent development team that listens to the community and wants to improve the game drastically. The game is incredibly inexpensive at $5.99, and therefore if you have others to play with, I would highly recommend this game because it's quite enjoyable. If you intend to play solo, it may get repetitive fairly quickly, but is fantastic nonetheless.General: 8.5/10"

,Recommended,431240,23706797,"Posted: 22 June, 2016",all,Antwog,"Golf With Your Friends is a solid golf simulation game developed and published by Blacklight Interactive. Blacklight has three employees with two owners of which are brothers. The game itself is currently in Early Access, therefore, I will not harshly critique this review. The issues I will mentionI have placed in the forums for the developers to note down and fix in the future. The idea of this game is similar to real life golf, you complete levels whilst attempting to achieve the lowest score compared to your opponent in order to win. I really enjoyed this game and it was thanks to playing with friends, as the title suggests, because it creates competition between you and your friends and allows you all to have fun.The overall idea is simple, you play golf. The game features a lobby with recently-added filters to separate the password servers from the non-password servers. The filters feature is crucial to the matchmaking component of this game because as the title suggests, there are many more password-locked servers that are friends playing with friends instead of people playing with the community. You can play with up to 12 friends in multiplayer, adding a nice balance between friends playing and not over-doing it with friends per say. The three maps of Forest, Oasis, and the new map Twlight are all well designed. Forest is relatively basic but gradually increases in difficulty as the levels progress, which is beneficial to new players. Forest has a course surrounded by trees and it features some neat obstacles like spinning blades, rolling logs, and even targets that help you shoot towards the hole. Oasis is a level that is influenced by Egypt in its sandy landscape and it's pyramids with Holes within a pyramid. I like the level because it contrasts Forest and has water, thus it provides a difference with the maps. Furthermore, it's fairly difficult so I do like the challenge and map design of Oasis. Twlight is a standard golf course featuring different Holes. What makes it unique though is that it incorporates more water than Oasis and the course takes place at night, showcasing the luscious environment. Twlight allows you to step back and relax so you can enjoy the overall scenery. Twlight is my favourite course due to the night time and lights effect. Despite the small amount of features, the game has a clear direction with a simple concept and it delivers on that. Furthermore, the developers are absolutely excellent at communicating with the community on a daily basis if its informing them on direction, such as a roadmap, or responding to general queries. Blacklight is committed to this game and it shows in their work ethic because from when I purchased the game to now, the game has drastically improved and it feels more fluid than before.I played this on both my PC and my Macbook Air 2015 edition and there were differences in performance between both systems. My experience of this game on the Macbook was days after purchasing the game last month. Performance on it was choppy at best as the game lagged consistently despite my system surpassing the recommendations and despite me playing on low settings. My friend has a newer and more powerful Macbook Pro and he could play the game smoothly on medium settings and not on high. However, the performance on my PC has improved greatly since purchasing the game. At purchase, I played on high settings and in return my computer was loud, I wasn't able to sustain a stable FPS, and the game took up 16% of my CPU and up to 400mb of memory, per my task manager. Now, my computer does not run loud and I can sustain a solid 55-60FPS. Per my task manager, the game takes up 13% CPU and 350mb of memory and while not a great improvement, it is still an improvement nonetheless. Overall, while the game continues to perform better, much more improvement is needed.As I stated prior, the game features an abundance of issues. However, Blacklight have been effective at improving the game and removing bugs. And, I have made a regular contribution to the Golf With Your Friends forums on the issues I encountered as I do want to help them fix the game and succeed. At purchase, my main issues with the game were the physics and the lag that came with it. For instance, the majority of shots in courses would be overrun by lag and glitches in the physics of putting the ball. Currently, the game has made noticeable improvements in both areas but do occasionally occur.Overall, Golf With Your Friends is a solid Early Access title that is best played with friends to maximise your entertainment. It incorporates the simple feature of golf and this basic idea has been successful through the three well designed maps that are in different landscapes. It contains an excellent development team that listens to the community and wants to drastically improve this game. As with any Early Access title, it does have its fair share of bugs, but the development team has ironed out the main issues and is constantly improving this game with regular patches. This game is incredibly cheap at $5.99 and therefore if you have friends to play with I highly recommend this game because it's fun. If you intend to play solo, quite frankly it is your choice because it may get boring but at $6, nothing can go wrong.Note, for an Early Access title I won't do a ratings score.If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

Please note that the name changedoes notaffect how the game plays. fs.First of all, with only 2 courses, this game ranks in my top 5 for price paid per hour of gameplay at 0.41c per hour, compared to rocket league (058.c) Euro Truck Sim 2 (0.63c) Civ 5 (1.24$) etc. for the amount of gameplay you get, its so worth the money.This is the best mini golf game on steam already, only 3 months in to EA.The two man dev team are passionately active on the forums, always taking into consideration what the community would like to see, they patch and fix bugs within hours (Most of the time) and are working really hard to make GWF a game that the community wants.As for the gameplay, its terribly easy to point your aim and take a shot, but the difficulty comes from choosing the right power and path to the hole. If you play in a big enough lobby there is bound to be someone who is great at the game, who will be more than willing to teach you a trick or two!With workshop support and new maps/reward system and skins coming soon you'll want to get on board straight away!All in all a great little time consuming, semi-competitive mini golf game with boundless creativity that shows great promise if (like the community believes) the developers stay as passionate as they are already.9/10"

One of them is called Forest and the other Oasis. At the moment Forest contains less bugs than Oasis which contains a few minor ones.MultiplayerThe mulitplayer lacks players but it is very easy to create your own server and you can play with up to 12 people. Joining servers is not as easy though as you have to go through a list of about 12 pages.

It gets the job done rather well.Gameplay8You would think mini-golf could only go so far with its options. Oh how wrong you would be. Lower gravity, increase bounce, change the ball shape (cube, triangle, etc), turn on collision, and more. Though there are currently only three courses, expect many more, and in the mean time enjoy what there is to offer. A couple downsides to the current gameplay: It can be quite glitchy at times, particular when trying to putt into the hole. The method for hitting the ball could also use some work, as it occasionally triggers false-positives and you hit the ball when you didn't mean to.StoryN/AJust the ridiculous moments you'll laugh about over and over with friends.Multiplayer10It has been a couple years since a game made me laugh this hard, this consistently, while playing with my friends. From watching them fail easy shots in hilarious ways, to hearing them cry out as their ball flies off the course, you'll find plenty of good times in this simple mini-golf game. The laughs kick up a notch once low-gravity and high bounce are enabled.Replayability7In its current state, there aren't quite enough levels to keep you occupied for a significantly long period of time. But what is there will keep you coming back to try different modes with various friends.Overall7.8/10With the promise of more to come, Golf With Your Friends already has a fantastic start. With three levels that have 18 holes each, and a surprisingly amount of customization in gameplay, it is the best mini-golf game I have encountered yet.

(Though playing with friends will give you an overall better experience, and if not, you need new friends).The game currently has four maps with a fifth one on the horizon, all of which has a different theme, you got your standard green forest type of map, a map set in the ancient Egypt, a map taking place in a enchanted magical forest, one in a haunted mansion and the fifth and upcoming one (as of this review) will feature a candyland sort of theme from my knowledge.The game does get somewhat repetitive after a few hours of gameplay once you figure out how every hole works and how to do well on them. This is a problem especially if you're playing multiplayer with strangers, and certain friends (Damn it Carl) since there is a handful of guides on Steam explaining how to get a hole-in-one or the best possible score on each hole, so more often than not you will play against someone who has memorized all the holes or just simply looking at a guide as they play.But there are a few settings you can play around with to spice things up incase you get bored such as: bigger golf balls, enable jumping (which makes the game way easier but is really enjoyable at the same time), enable gravity and so on.I haven't experienced any game-breaking bugs myself but the game is in Early Access so chances are there are a few bugs and glitches here and there that needs to be eliminated, aswell as more content being added in the future.For $6 this game is defenitely worth picking up, and you're able to get it for less during sales. And since it's not very expensive you can most likely talk some friends into buying it, or perhaps you can be generous and gift a copy to them.Very fun and enjoyable game to play casually!"

The courses are creatively designed, challenging, aesthetically pleasing, and fun to play. The game currently has four 18-hole courses with two more expected to be developed before GwyF leaves Early Access. There are plenty of modifiers to increase the replayabilitly, especially when playing with friends, such as ball shape, ball size, gravity, bounciness, and collisions. Playing with the feature to jump the ball at will drastically changes how the courses need to be played.I can't really comment on playing the game solo, since I always play with friends, but it's a blast to play with a group over voice chat. GwyF has a text chat in-game if you cannot voice chat.GwyF is still in Early Access, and as such, has its share of issues. There are various bugs on some of the courses that involve clipping, going out of bounds, or getting stuck, especially when playing with different ball shapes; however, the devs have been keen on making sure those bugs are corrected. The spectator mode needs work. Some of the holes are flat-unplayable with certain ball shapes. It can also be somewhat of a pain to find your friends' lobby since there's no feature to invite from Steam. Most of these issues aren't necessarily game-breaking, and they normally come out to be hilarious and quirky at best, and mildly irritating at worst.All in all, GwyF is well worth its low price. It's simple, well designed, fun, and has a good amount of content, with more on the way."

They are very friendly and active on the forums and is taking community ideas and advice to make the game even better while also adding more to it in a fast enough manner.I highly recommend this to someone who wants a game that is more casual but has the options to make it a stressful race to the hole against others.

,Recommended,431240,34656233,Posted: 1 September,all,MOb6996,"This game may seem a little bland at first, but trust me, this game has many symbolic and deep cultureous references hidden. First, the large tree on course 9 at the Candyland map is actually a reference to turkish folklore. Many religious turkish records depict the tree as a symbol of peace, now you may ask, why does this even matter? Well, to answer this question we have dive deep into the 15th centuries various religious records (which I won't because none of us actually  posses the amount of IQ which is required to understand such deep religious teachings). For instance the bible quotes ""May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit"" this is also an obvious reference to the cross which is halfway stuck into the ground at course 17. The funny part is, the cross is placed directly in front of the hole, which means the game obviously trying to tell the player that what we do is due to fate not luck. What I stated above are the reasons to why this game is absouloutely amazing, but, there is one thing that I hate about this game. Its the ♥♥♥♥ING GRASS! WHY DOESN'T THE ♥♥♥♥ING GRASS MOVE WHEN THE BALL IS OBVIOUSLY MOVING THROUGH IT! BAD ♥♥♥♥ING GAME DESIGN.

,Recommended,431240,33952020,Posted: 1 August,all,RhapidFyre~,"This game already has great reviews so I will just add my short two cents.Pros:- Very fun gameplay - Even an extremely casual game like this can have tense moments when you are 2 strokes from beating your friend who's right behind you.- Mechanics - The gameplay mechanics are above decent. Not perfect, but great. I can judge my direction and power pretty easily, and have an idea of what I am doing.- Freeform Camera - Pressing ""C"" in game will let you fly around in ""noclip"" mode, so you can view the courses. This needs to be made more clear from the get go, it took me several games to figure this out, and until then, I was shooting blind hoping for some kind of miraculous Hole-in-One.- Random multiplayer server support, you don't HAVE to play with...your friends...Cons:- Early Access Game, so there are some bugs. A hole (I don't recall which number) in the Candyland map allows you to fall off the course behind the hole, and if you roll back underneath the map, you can hole your ball underneath it, due to the detection trigger the map uses. It was very annoying that one of our friends tried to tell us it was a fair shot when clearly it was a glitch.- While teeing off is simple and you can jump right into it, some other commands and ideas are not so easy. It was very hard to learn what to do on some maps (candyland specifically, the water slide hole with the 3 ramps) without direction or previous experience with the game. Another problem as mentioned above was no inclination to use the ""C"" button to fly around and see the course you're on before teeing off.Overall, great casual game. If you're looking for a cheap time killer, Golf With Your Friends is a good boredum killer and has replay value."

Turn-based would add more pressure to each shot, for example. $6 is more than worth it for the fun you're going to get out of the two 18-hole courses (a forest and an egyptian temple-themed one). Perhaps I'm greedy, but I want more! I'll happily shell out a few more bucks if need be for some DLC courses; just don't get carried away!

All you have to do is hold the left click and pull back the mouse.Runs great on most computersThere's a ton more pros but you guys get the idea.Cons:Not a lot of players. Game came out Janurary 30th and didn't get featured on the front page of Steam, so it might be awhile before the playerbase gets heavier.Only two courses, 18 holes each. They are currently working on some other courses and the potential of a content creator added.Some glitches. Just about all non game breaking.---As you can see there are tons of reasons to by this game, the big one being it's not like other horrible early access games that are just buggy messes.

It is mini golf but has some kinda annoying music, which you just turn off but for the sound itself it again is nothing enjoyable.  Just basic.Controls: The controls are simple mouse to use, so easy you learn the game on the first few seconds and cannot complain about it at all.Gameplay: The gameplay is mini golf basically... What do you want? You can turn normal minigolf into some insane fun with friends... Up too 12 people might I add and there are several options you can change in the modes options to make the game even more enjoyable, which range from low low gravity, different balls like egg shape, cube shape, cyclinder shape and so on, so mix all these together and you've got a lot of fun going for you!Right now as I write this review, there are only 3 zones and each zone contains roughly 19 holes each.  Sadly, you can do these in under an hour, depending on the settings you have!Still the game is insanely cheap and will be getting a lot of work and more content in the mix and for that, I would highly highly recommend the game!So yes, go and buy!"

This game will wish you had. IT is purely a social experienced that is there to kill a bit of time, record something stupid and love every second. There will be disbelief and rage amongst chaos and humor.Golf, well... it's golf. Think putt-putt in a blender. Can be slow on standard, or hectic with different shaped balls or even cubes and that is not mentioning the jumping.Early access. The game holds up well with it's biggest flaw being a lack of content. When I purchased it, there were only three different ""maps"" that housed a full course of 18 holes. To my knowledge now, there is 4 maps. I would say there really need to be a significant jump in content before I call it a completed game.Overall I would vote it a 7/10 for what it is, an early access golf game.

Is a fantastic game to play with friends, particularly as a drinking party game. In my opinion, the game is much less enjoyable by yourself and as the title suggests it is meant to be played with others. Granted that the game is in early access, I've run into a solid amount of bugs and complete game crashes. The last hole of the Oasis course is almost completely luck based and needs to be tweaked, but otherwise is a very balanced, relaxed, skill based game.Absolutely worth $5, you won't regret it."

,Recommended,431240,25828622,"Posted: 2 October, 2016",all,Plebby,"First off, I would highly reccommend this game to anyone. This game is some of the most fun you can have in multiplayer games. You can also play singleplayer, but if you want to have fun, you really need a bunch of friends playing it with you. I would give this game a solid 9/10 on enjoyment. I can't judge how the game is built too much since it's currently only in version .096, a long while until fully complete.Visuals - 8/10A game doesn't have to be good to have good graphics. This game has graphics that are good enough. Looking at some games that run at 1080p 60fps for me such as some table pool ones, look fine, but don't fit the game. The graphics just don't fit the mood of the music or the game your actually playing. On Golf With Your Friends though, the graphics fit the game. The graphics go well with the music as well. The graphics don't cause the game to slowdown, even with my meh computer. I wouldn't change anything about how this game looks if I could.Music - 7/10Some of the tracks in this game can get a bit repetitive, but they are still pretty decent. The music fits great with not only the graphics, but the mood you'll be in while playing this game: happy. I'm going to end the music section quick just to save time, not too much to say about it.Singleplayer - 5/10I don't give this game a very high score for singleplayer. The game is still fun, but not nearly as fun as if you were playing with a bunch of friends. If you do have friends but they don't feel like playing at that moment, you can go mess around with 50 shots and level retries trying to find ways to get holes in ones though, and the courses alone are entertaining.Multiplayer - 9.5/10I think this game has a potential to make a 10/10 in this area, but again, it's not complete yet. Sitting down with my friends playing this game is one of my favorite things to do. Me and my friends even named each score (Hole in one, birdie, bogie, etc.) after Garfield characters, even calling running out of shots/time a ""burnt lasagna"". The amount of laughs I've gotten out of my friends failing, or just the tention of a friend being on the last level when you don't know who's going to win.Replay Value - 8/10This game has a lot of customizable features in the custom game settings. If you want, you can make the ball into an egg or a cube, you can turn on low gravity, high bounce, jumping, etc. You can customize your ball color if you want, but not that exciting. The devs have said that they plan to add minigames in the future. One suggestion someone had was that you would have to get the ball somewhere while in a pinball machine, or into a basketball hoop, which sounds amazingly fun. The dev commented on this idea saying he might impliment it, so you can already see that the creators are listening.Overall - 9/10 (for now)This indie game is amazingly fun, and I hope that all of you reading this review buy it right now and play it with some friends. There is a lot of hope for this game, and I can't wait  to see it thrive forward. This game is 100% worth the 6 dollars I payed for it, and I would probably but this game if it was 30 or 40 dollars, it is an amazing game, that again, I would reccomend to anyone. - Coddlington (me)"
76561197993626713,Recommended,431240,26702055,"Posted: 19 November, 2016",all,NailDive,"At the time of writing, Golf With Your Friends is still in Early Access, but having been on the market since January 30th, I’m pretty comfortable in my assumption that nothing ground-breaking is going to come out of the game, and that it’s at a point where GWYF can be reviewed for the long-term.Golf With Your Friends is one of those stunningly aptly named games that despite its simplicity, still manages to imbue the game with a sense of fun before you even get to playing it. I’m really lucky when it comes to reviewing this game, because the 8-Bit Preppers crew all grabbed a copy one night to play together, and I feel as though that initial session really let GWYF show us exactly what it was all about. There were tears of laughter, no small amount of sledging, and cries of “♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t” as we played through the three maps that were available. It was an excellent initial experience, and we have managed to wring a few more sessions out of it by changing the physics options, and by joining public games, but in the end GWYF faces the same dilemma that many early access multiplayers face: Content.In the ten months since its release, Blacklight Interactive has added one extra course to Golf With Your Friends. One. It fills me with disappointment to think of how popular this game could have been upon release if it had more courses, or if more courses were released in a timely manner over the duration of the Early Access period. Like most simple games of skill, GWYF has the potential to be one of those excellent casual games that never gets uninstalled. There are great variations in the four courses that are available at this stage, and I am genuinely interested to see what the next two courses that are scheduled for release in the “full game” will look like. I am, however, pretty sceptical that they will be released before mid 2017, considering the fourth map took so long to release. If Blacklight Interactive really wanted to ensure the longevity of GWYF, release of a level editor with the full game would go a long way towards that.I have to admit that on a fundamental level I still think that releasing games before they are finished is an affront to consumers, but at the same time I can also appreciate its benefits for fledgling Developers like Blacklight Interactive. The good news is that in Golf With Your Friends, they have set very reasonable targets for what is going to be included in the full game. I just wonder if without a level editor or something that adds value and replayability, whether this will just be another casual multiplayer picked up on sale for the majority of consumers. My advice is to plan a game session with your mates, and milk every bit of enjoyment you can from that initial gameplay."

,Recommended,431240,24540663,"Posted: 26 July, 2016",all,Audish,"Is there anything more sublime than a round of minigolf with your buddies? Some of my fondest childhood memories were of birthday parties at the putt-putt course, and even as an adult I sometimes cajole my co-workers into a round or two. Like the name suggests, Golf With Your Friends aims to capture that same simple joy, and does so with an ever-growing list of content and features.When I first jumped into GWYF there were but three courses to choose from, Forest, Oasis, and Twilight, at 18 holes apiece. Forest hews closest to what you remember of minigolf, with the classic windmill, Plinko drop, and river jump holes. Oasis is an Egyptian-themed course with longer, more elaborate holes that cross over and send the ball flying through the clear desert sky. Twilight is a significant jump in difficulty, with unforgiving ramps and pits that might require half a dozen or more strokes to get just right. Added to those now are Haunted, Candyland, and Ancient, which vary even more in challenge and variety of scenery.Navigating these courses is as easy as click, drag, and release. Your mouse aims your shot and you pull back to fill the four-part power bar, which gives you a wide range of control over the ball. Everything from feather-light taps to line drives are possible, and the holes you encounter will require them all. There's definitely a learning curve to the courses, a large part of that being no preview or free camera to scout your shots so learning the courses is expected. Once you have the lay of the land, the challenge becomes learning just the right finesse to put on the ball to overcome the traps. I could come close to par on all the courses after just a round or two, but it does require come patience to learn the more insidious holes.That's probably going to be the biggest hangup for anyone looking for a casual golfing experience, honestly. GWYF isn't really here to simulate a real-world putt-putt outing, but rather a fanciful, hectic, arcadey approximation of the sport. Holes can be huge, sprawling, and require you to carom balls off of statuary, comestibles, and levitating decor. Getting some of the gimmick holes right can take dozens of shots and while replicating that success isn't too hard, having the patience to suss it out might be an uphill battle. Especially with the uphill holes.At least the interface is simple enough to get you into a game almost immediately. Since this golf is intended to be enjoyed with (your) friends, every game is set up as a hosted server. Choosing to join gives you a handy browser with all the filters you could want, and hosting plops you down with name, password, and custom game options. One nice touch is that the lobby itself is a practice hole where you can putt around different obstacles while waiting for the match proper. And then there are loads of alternate modes and silly options to enable if you just want to fool around with your balls. The player base seems pretty chill as well and it's always easy to find a match, even if it's not necessarily the course or options I might want at the moment.The graphics have been improving along with the content, taking ever-fuller advantage of the Unity engine to render its hazards and accouterments in excellent detail. The sound design is less ambitious, featuring a peppy, looping soundtrack and only the most basic effects. Obviously you're going to have more fun if you have the titular Your Friends to play with, but even going in solo there's plenty of fun to be had. Even in its early state, Golf With Your Friends contains enough fun and adventures to make it worth your time.Did you enjoy this review? I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope you'll check out more of them athttps://goldplatedgames.com/or on mycuration page!"

It is best played with friends (as obviously pointed out in the title) since you may meet trolls in multiplayer and ruin your experience. It’s an Early Access Game at the moment, and will only get better as time comes along.GET IT BEFORE EARLY ACCESS IS OVER #SELLOUTMy First Thoughts on Golf With FriendsOn normal settings, Golf With Friends is surprisingly realistic, considering I’m a real golfer myself (please point out that the levels themselves are not actually realistic, just the physics of the game). The list of physics and ball customizations can go from challenging to a straight out clown fiesta – from changing the gravity to ball shape. As I said in theTL;DRsection above, Golf With Friends is best played with friends – to either have a fair and just game of golf or straight up mess around and have fun; since if you hop into a random lobby, you may face the chance of trolls.ProsThe physics are surprisingly realistic.To add onto the previous point, there are a lot of customizable options in the game – ball color, visuals, ball physics, ball shape, ground bounciness, gravity, you name it!The music literally motivates you into playing round after round, with the classic arcade feel.It’s Balanced.Lady Luck is Smilingscrew Twisted Fate (a character), the game’s in your hands, the game won’t interfere with your gaming experience.Colorful ballsKreygasmIt’s very good for a game at this price. At the same price (Early Access 6 US Dollars) you can only find unbalanced games that have less quality then a Mortal Kombat arcade Cabinet from the 1990’s.ConsThe game has a few bugs, but since it’s Early Access I’ll let it slip by. Thus, the bugs aren’t game breaking, just my OCD kicking in.Despite the name of the game beingGolf With Friends, trolling your friend can lead to somewhat harsh loads of salt pouring from the sky.Honestly, there aren’t really any cons I’m just trying to make it a somewhat unbiased review for such a gorgeous game; I mean hey, nothing’s perfect am I right?ConclusionThe game is fantastic and beats a lot of its competitors for such a low price. This is something that I would recommend to my friends anyday.(If you found the review helpful, giving it a thumbs up would be nice!)If you're looking for more Steam Friends? Look no more - feel free to add me!Thus if you have any questions on the review, hit me up! Send me a message, I should be on at least an hour a day.Edit 1: Some formatting changes."

More courses are promised, along with a level creator, so there should be tons of replayability in the future.Also, the devs are super active in responding to community feedback. Moreso than I've seen for most indie developers, or game devs in general. They are extremely passionate about their game and don't want anyone to be left out due to a small glitch that doesn't allow them to play.If you don't like minigolf, though, there's nothing here for you.

I have never had so much fun playing a video game in YEARS now, Golf with Friends is easily the funnest thing I have ever done.The game itself is extremely well polished for early access, if they didn't say on the store page, they could have easily sold this as a full release and nobody would question it, even with only two courses (18 holes each) it's so well done.The music is very happy sounding, and quite addicting, it repeats on a loop basically forever... But you don't even notice it, even on a loop it's just that fitting to the game.  I could listen to this on a daily basis and still love it.The physics of the game are almost flawless, with a little skill you can predict exactly where the ball will go, and sink that hole in one every time.The courses, for there only being two... Are beautifully designed, with the classics such as windmills... All the way to being eaten by a sphinx, going throughout it's body, and being launched out into a temple of doom.You've also got loops, half pipes, bouncing platforms that launch your ball all over, bank shots off pillars, running along the walls, fake holes that launch you off the course. They've got it all!It's a lot of fun playing singleplayer, sadly there are no AI so you're all alone, but it's decent fun.But once you add even a single friend to the game... Oh boy, get ready for one hell of a time! The more you add, the more fun it is.  Exponentially more fun, when on Skype or other method of talking to your other players.The dev team for this game is very small, only two people, but they are extremely active in the community discussions, taking suggestions, helping with issues, and are just providing an outstanding experience for their users.10/10 game, 15/10 devs."

But this game however, really captures that magic of going to a mini golf course and playing. Having only played the 2 courses once each and no friends yet to play it with, this game will have a lot of replay value. Once more maps are added and custom maps are added I plan to play a lot more of it. I do hope that the custom maps can be accessed through some sort of a ""gallery"" or ""player submitted"" page with reviews of how good the maps are and maybe even records on each map.I give it a 10/10 in its current state."
,Recommended,431240,22259930,"Posted: 5 April, 2016",all,Jeppz,"This is really a fun game. Due to it being early access at the moment, you might have a limited experience, but fun none the less. It's a fantastic game to play with your friends (I suggest being on voice comms with them, it's really funny).I feel that I can't explain it better than ""it's good fun"", so here's a list of good and lacking aspects of this game that I have come across in my 7 hours of playtime:Good:- Very easy to pick up and play.  Within 30 minutes of starting the game I was already able to play on a decent competitive level against others.- The controls are wonderful. Feels very smooth when you play it and it doesn't take long for you to master the ways of the putt-putt.- Stimulating/satisfying gameplay; this is the kind of game I just love to play while watching a movie or YouTube on my second monitor.- Playing together with friends is alot of fun and depending on how you customize the game rules, you can get some proper Mario Kart-esque competitive fun.Lacking:- As of posting this, there are only 2 maps; Forest and Oasis. There is a big shift in difficulty between the two. Forest is very easy and the pars/hole-in-ones can be memorized within an hour, while Oasis is very tricky and requires alot of good timing. This will no doubt be no issue once more maps have been added.- I have experienced a few weird occurrences regarding the physics of the game. Sometimes when you hit a wall straight on, your ball can bounce away at an angle. Sometimes you can suddenly go off a jump and go way higher than you usually do.- The server browser is probably the worst thing right now, as you cannot sort the listings in any way, and you have to painstakingly check if the server is in the Lobby and has no password requirements. A way to sort the server list and filter out password requiring servers would be awesome.Note: Even though there are these lacking aspects of the game, the good aspects override them most of the time.All in all, I'd say this game guarantees at least 3 hours of fun, and much more if you can get a few friends to play with."

The only thing I'd say is missing so far is Workshop support, or at least the ability for players to create and share custom made maps.With the different types of objects you can use to get to the end of the course, the game is either really easy, or really tough. But still really fun.Just grab a couple of friends (or just let random people join you) and go wild.

This is a surprisingly fun minigolf game for up to 12 players, across three levels 18 holes each (at the time of writing this review), so there's a lot of minigolf to be had. It gets really tricky and fun when the host enables the ball jump, which means you can cut through holes in creative ways.Friendship is over when the host enables solid ball mode - you can knock your friend away back to square one if you're lucky.Also, all 12 players play the same hole at the same time, which speeds things up considerably.Although the game is in Early Access, all the important parts are working.

There's really no other way to describe it.Pros:Customisation - Balls can be customised to a colour and the lobby host can change the physics of the game by changing the ball shape, gravity, bounce height, toggling collisions with other players, etc. Makes for a laugh with low gravity, bouncy eggs.Simplicity - The game is simple with a minimalist art style, runs on pretty much any machine very well. Do note that 'Medium' and 'High' settings have their FPS capped, where as 'low' is uncapped.Fun - Just, fun. Like a game should be.Affordable - Definitely worth the price, an absolute blast to play.Cons:Maps - only two maps at the moment, however these are very cool. I especially like the Oasis map as it has some really cool features like the river section.Dear devs:Please add workshop compatibility later in development, it would be awesome to have the community make custom maps, also please make more maps of your own as I love the level design currently in game!Overall verdict:Fun, easy to run, affordable - get it, especially if you like mini golf."

As it stands now, controls for this game are ergonomic and pleasurable to use. There are 4 levels and they are each pretty well constructed to mimic the idiosyncrasies of real life mini-golf. The lobby/multiplayer system is already in place, so you can (as the title says) Golf with your Friends!The developers are 3 guys based out of Australia with no prior track record. They have been promising so far with updates and addressing user concerns (via forums, emails, or Discord), but I always err on the side of caution since the income from an Early Access game can sometimes alter agendas; this is especially true for developers that have no investors and haven't had that sort of money before.Verdict: the game is great fun. You won't save much by waiting for it to go on sale. Potentially be ready for the developers to have a change of heart."

,Recommended,431240,31031503,Posted: 8 April,all,SolumnMushroom,"Who doesn't love a good game of mini-golf?  If you don't, you are looking at the wrong product, friend.  Golf With Your Friends is exactly what it says on the tin.  An online mini-golf game, complete with Workshop and cross-platform support.  Going into this game, I was very excited, as it is 100% up my alley, and I even have friends to play it with!  Imagine that.  If you don't, there are open servers and the community is very active.  I can't judge the community in terms of play experience, due to only playing in private servers, but it's mini-golf so how bad can it be?With all of that said, this game isn't perfect.  My primary issue with the game is that it isn't very well optimized.  I tested this game on an HP Envy 17-1181 (Core i7 940XM, 8GB RAM, ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5850) and on a late 2012 MacBook Air (Core i5-3427U, 4GB RAM, Intel HD Graphics 4000).  Both run the game smoothly enough, but the game caused audio issues with Discord on the Mac, and caused the HP to shut down due to overheating.  Granted, the HP runs hot normally, but other Unity games don't cause the computer to shut down.  To be completely fair, the game is in Early Access, so this issue should be patched out once the game goes Gold.  Additionally, unlike a AAA development team, the devs of this game are probably limited on their testing hardware, so they can't possibly make the game run perfectly on every computer.  So while the poor optimization is an issue I ran into, I'm not as bothered by it as I would in another game.I'm normally rather critical of the Early Access model, as it can feel like a leap of faith to the consumer.  This game is very worth playing, if only to see just how high (or low, if you have skill) your score can get.  I ended Oasis with 100+."

The development team are great especially with rolling out updates for the game even though it is in early access i think that this game will become very popular i the futureit Consists of 4 maps with stunning visuals and detail you can create a server upto 12 players and can also have custom settings which allow you to change the appearance of your golf ball the size and other crazy options which add an effective twist to your game. You can also have a classic mode which has the original settings. the controls are easy as all you really need is a mouse which will be good for the beginners.in the future i would love to see them add a map editor which would be awesome and maybe more player slots on the serversit would also be cool to maybe add steam trading cards the people who collect badgesbut overall a absolute great game i think it has  great potential.great work guys over at the development team :)

Played competitively it's a bit of a mixed bag, with some courses being a little too clever for their own good and some glitches and connection issues causing problems from time to time. As a less-serious party experience, it's an absolute riot. It takes some time to figure out which of the adjustable settings are suited for actual gameplay and not just one-off gimmicks (there are a lot of goofy ball shapes that are funny for 2 minutes and then never again), but you can get many hours of entertainment out of this game if you and your friends discover the right way to play it.The lobby badly needs a search feature and some word filtering, though.

Some glitches as to be expected for an early access game but a lot have been or are getting smoothed out as time goes on. My friends and I like to all get in a TS and then let the shenanigans unfold from there which is always good for a laugh.Things that I hope they address:-adding at least 3 more maps-add a ""Search"" feature for finding specific lobbies-adding some sort of (optional) ingame voice chat so you can vocally talk with other people in the game-changing the hole times by increments of 15 seconds instead of 30 (hard to do a speed round in 30sec but 1 min seems to be too much as well)-enable punctuation in the lobby title (want this so I can make the title the TS IP)-some way of reducing that eternal roll your ball can get stuck in on some of the mild slopesOverall love this game and all it's other features. Jump is a little cheap but for some reason everyone seems to love it. The random shapes games can be tough enough to make one pull their hair out. I would have no problem buying this at it's current price of $5.99 even. Well worth it especially if you can get a group of friends to join in.FOUR!!"

With four courses and a fifth one on the way soon, this game is a steal. There are a few small bugs as it's still in early access, but overall the game is very playable.Cons: The default setting will heat up your CPU/GPU so you need to lock the FPS to 30 or 60 instead of leaving it on 'unlimited'. Sometimes this setting will revert back and must be changed again. One obvious thing that is missing is a 'high score' record, hopefully this gets added later. Lastly, signing up for a Classic game only to have it changed to Custom at the last minute can be aggravating. I would like to see classic games locked to classic upon creation.Pros: Several custom options keep the game interesting should you get bored of playing on classic mode, and the skee ball game on the practice course is something fun to do while you wait for your party to assemble.Overall great game! 8.5/10"

This really annoys me because this is only early access and this game hasnt been out for very long and its quite hard to program a new game so instead of hating and pointing out the bad things look at the good things and change the bloody ball shape and dont say 'but the ball wont go where I want it too' thats the fun of the game idiot.

,Recommended,431240,29145451,Posted: 9 January,all,Hostile Hippo,"I bought this game after a friend suggested we all buy it and play. I was hesitant at first, but I can safely say now for the price that they’re asking, it is well worth the buy. For an early access game, it is probably the most functional thing I have played. Of course it has bugs and glitches that can be frustrating at times, but majority of the time, it just adds to the ridiculousness of the game.Some positives about the game, are definitely its functionality, again like I said, it is probably the most functioning early access game I’ve played. There is a lot of content in the early access stages, and you can easily play the game for a couple of hours, whether it be trying to play legitimately or screwing around to get that sweet trick shot.Some negatives about the game, which I’m sure will get fixed is, some of the level design is a bit wonky in some areas, but overall well done. The game obviously has bugs, it’s in early access, and it’s not going to be perfect. Depending on your perspective, the game changes every now and then with updates, so if you’re a person who gets used to how to play a game easily, don’t, because this game definitely updates at a good pace.Would I recommend this game? Of course I would! For the 6 bucks I paid, it’s probably the best thing I’ve purchased in a long time. I definitely got my money’s worth and I always enjoy the game when I play it. It’s perfect for those moment when you have no idea what to play with your friends and just need something casual."

,Recommended,431240,32622552,Posted: 21 June,all,SwanChairUh,"GWYF is a solid purchase, at $6 full price, it's a great value if you play it with the right people. If you think you'll enjoy putting around with your friends, you probably will, it gets the essential things like physics and putting strength right. There isn't much to say about the game overall because it's simple and straightforward about what it is, but there is one flaw I just don't like about this game.The only real complaint I have with GWYF is that the newer course designs are pretty abysmal. The Forest, Egypt, Candyland, and Dark Forest maps are pretty great, but Haunted and the newest Ancient map are pretty lukewarm. The problem with these two courses is that the developers designed them to make the course challenge you, instead of having your friends challenge you. Haunted and Ancient have a lot of places you'll frusteratingly go out of bounds over and over again, sometimes with questionable vision of where you're hitting towards. (Also why isn't freecam unlimited duration by default?Ttake your game a little less seriously). Egypt and Forest are especially good because they are straightforward, and let your competition drive the fun in getting a good score. The better maps also have curveballs here and there to mix it up but don't go too crazy with the jumps, elevation around the holes, and ""wind-elevators"" (just why?) found in Ancient. Custom settings make these problems a little more bareable, which is a nice little inclusion.I ranted a bit but GWYF is a really fun game. A level editor is on it's way and if it's a good advanced editor at all, it can make this good game into a great game. If you think you'll enjoy this game, you will, especially for $6."

As the alpha testing currently shows, this game can prove to blow up to be huge one day.Pros//There is a very open and welcoming community to join into. I have been invited to play with about 5 different strangers in the course of 3 days of having the game just for being online.//Balance between competitive and chill gameplay. You can choose when to tryhard and don't have to worry about slacking a few games.//Achievements are definitely something to strive for as this game is still being developed.//Costs very little compared to other titles.//Mutator settings add variety to gameplay.//Multiplayer is both fun and exciting in a public server or a private lobby of your own.//Free roam in multiplayer lobby is definitely a new idea for a golf game.//Already has huge player base.Cons//Other than poor RGB sliders, the game has little customization implementations.//Offers little replayability. Does begin to get repetitive as you play the game.//Visuals are on the low side (thus far)Final ThoughtsI definitely do see this game going places in the future. I have seen how responsive the develpopers and moderators are both in discord and through steam. They do make sure to keep up with how the community is coming along, and how the growth of the game as well.

The controls are pretty easy to grasp. In terms of the core golf experience, it's pretty much great... excluding a few holes, of course. If you're in a bad spot, you're gonna stay in that spot for a while, eating up your strokes.Besides, that, we tried a number of custom/random assortments of game tweaks, such as a ""Random Thingy"" challenge where we were all the same random shape and size with the ability to jump once with some additional time and shots. Then we did ""EXTREME Random Thingies"" (I know, great name) where instead of 'random all', we did 'random each'; let's just say our friendship was in jeopardy, lol. Finally, we attempted a custom hoops gamemode where the gravity was 0.25, bounciness was at medium, and you could super jump... kind of a zero-gravity basketball, if you will. That was pretty fun, but still frustrating in a good way.I can't wait for the level editor (I mean I REALLY CAN'T WAIT, lol), and if you devs look at this review, I have a few suggestions:-allow for player-made preset 3d shapes to be freely placed and texturized however the player may please so new buildings or objects could be made using the same materials as the regular levels-make some things adjustable, like the fans or conveyors, of course-if a player applies a conveyor or speed pad to, let's say a half-loop, the mechanics of the conveyor should be applied to that part of the shape or part or whateverThank you for reading!  While it is still under development, I would give this game a shot for the many wacky things you can do. Have a great day, ladies n' gents!"

(putting a cone a few places in candyland LOL)Very few ramps/runways/general ground areas don't match up perfectly which results in little bumps to crazy physics bugs.I really have nothing bad to say about this game at all, and as soon as the game starts it gives you a warning that the game is in alpha, there are bugs, it is what it is. It's not as bad as the warning makes it seem, in my opinion. The first ""Con"" is really on you, not the game. When you change gravity, use weird shapes, and have to jump a slightly bumpy spiral ramp, and can't make it... welll... duh. lol. The second is totally understandable, it's in alpha, and they are so far and few, it's just another thing for you and your friends to laugh and cry about, just adding to the overall experience.100% Worth it."

TLDR at BottomThis review is mostly compiled from what I have seen on the game's discussionsIt's a really good game for early access with only 2 developers. The devs are very active and friendly with the community and seem to take suggestions/criticism very well. They are very helpful when it comes to helping someone fix an issue. From what I have played I have not encountered any bugs, but if someone is to come across a bug/glitch they can make a post about it on the discussions and relax knowing that the devs will notice it and work on fixing it. There's usually an update with new features around every month, but there seems to be a lot of bugfix updates usually every week at least.Not much to it as of right now, but that'll change over time. There's only 2 maps currently and they can be completed fairly quickly. Once you get bored of playing the maps on classic you can always do a challenge mode that involves changing the timer or mac strokes for each hole. And if that still isn't interesting enough there's modifiers like ball shapes and so on. It's best to play this game with friends because it's not nearly as fun alone. You can always play online with randoms, but that requires stable internet (that which I do not have) so I don't know how well that is, but I've seen very few people complain about the community or the lag so that's good.If you have good internet and friends, then I'd say go ahead and buy the game. However, I wouldn't recommend buying it right now if you're like me and can't play games online. Technically speaking it's unplayable for me due to the fact that you have to be connected to the servers in order to play, but that's more of an issue for me. I'm certain I'll be able to recommend it 100% when they add local multiplayer, bots, and offline play.TLDRGreat game. Amazing devs.  Not much content currently. Worth it if planning to play online. Should probably wait if planning to play offline."

The makers of this game has a twitch stream where you may submit holes for courses and they may create and play the hole that you designed. This games is where you are able to relax and play a game of mini golf too. The game looks nice and since it is in early access, you can wait for more content to be created. content may be slow at times but waiting isn’t that bad.

The course design is very good and although the customization is pretty mediocre, the simple to learn controls and fun atmosphere certainly are a welcome to me. However, there are a few optimizations to be made, as I have a GTX 970, and can get about an average of 30 FPS. After that gets fixed, it's a pretty damn solid game. Oh, did I mention modifiers? That's a game changer as changing gravity, or giving the ability to jump adds a new element to the game which I really enjoy and adds a new way to play. I like this game yes, but with customization, and optimization, I would LOVE this game."

Playing this game is very fun with friends and its really cheap on specs which is good as more people can play it despite owning a graphics cardless tablet... however the lack of customizable controls and lack of levels at the moment is hindering the number of people playing the game. This can be improved by having multiple sets of controls to suit different needs. Another drawback is the fact that you dont know where the hole is unless you've shot your ball or played it a few times making it very hard for hole in one for new players. It can be improved by adding a mini map or a walk around view to see what the entire course looks like. At this stage of development, i wouldn't reccomend playing this game ALONE... unless your friends have it, then buying it would be worth it !"

76561198025427208,Recommended,431240,30017601,Posted: 18 February,all,trdsf,"This is a game that has the potential to be a great little minigolf game, but isn't quite there yet.  The main issue is that the dividing line between success and disaster is too fine.  When the only way to complete a hole is to hitpreciselyone spot, with no margin for error, the frustration level piles up quickly.  You're not alone here, Blacklight - Vertiginous Golf has essentially the same problem.  Having a rotten angle or needing to just putt out to safety is enough of a penalty; having to replay a stroke until gottenexactlyright sucks the fun factor way down.It's a principle of golf course design -- and the same applies to minigolf -- that if the route to the hole is high-risk, there should be a bail out option for players who aren't at that level yet.  I certainly wouldn't play a regular golf course where every tee shot required a 300 yard carry over water with no other way to the hole.A little on-course direction would be a good idea -- it doesn't need to be precise, but when you're on a timer and don't know which way the hole is, that doesn't help the frustration level either.That said, it is a very good game.  The graphics are excellent (if a little eye-twisting on Candy Land), the mechanics are straightforward, the play is smooth, and the music is not only appropriate, it's even kind of charming.Overall,Recommended.  If the vast gulf between risk and reward narrows, I would even change that to Highly Recommended... but not yet."

You can shoot along a wall and get your ball bounce directly back, because there's just pinaccle that extends just a tiny little bit out of the wall.This game is just poorly made.

The 5 different courses are very unique and different from each other and very colourful. You can use the different ‘props’ in each course to your advantage for example aiming the golf ball at a cauldron in the Haunted course or trying to aim onto a trampoline in the Forest course.As with classic mini golf courses this game has obstacles to avoid or to aim through or bounce from. Some of the pins are easy to see so that you know which direction to go but some of them are harder with hidden views and trickier pathways to navigate.You can also customise the colour of your golf ball, host your own game rooms or join another’s game room. So even if your friends are not online there is always someone to play a round of golf with.Watch my You Tube channel to see how much fun we have playing this gameFull Playlist herehttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJcmAk9VUnqm0Q7iXAoloNbdcl-JEBC1lMy favorite coursehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9v8yebHdCY"

The ability to pause, resign, or dilly away some time makes this one of my favorites since my life has a number of interuptions. For anyone who dislikes the game, from what I can see from their list of complaints, they completely missed the point of an open beta game which allows you to throw eggs and other strange shapes. I'm not quite certain whaty they were thinking they were getting for a miniature fantasy golfing simulation game with how they whine about lack of options. You can change gravity, add collision, and fiddle about to see how far you can screw up your shot. It can be downright hillarious some of the things which happen at random, and cannot be repeated. I look forward to future updates and mind puzzlers from Blacklight."

That is if you have friends who also already have / will buy the game. If you get a few friends together, and play this game, you will probably have a lot of fun for a good few hours.Usually I would not review an early access game, however the devs of this game are doing everything right. They are constantly tweaking, fixing, and updating the game, and listening to the community to try to make the game the best that it can be.As I mentioned, there are only 3 maps, which are Oasis, Forest, and Twilight, and the devs have confirmed that another map ""Haunted House,"" is in development, and released a long list of maps that they have considered adding in to the game (many of which are taken from the community.)With so many devs ignoring the community of people who keep their game alive, it is good to see some devs listening and caring about the experience that their players have. They have also said that there are many features to be added in the future, including a map creator.I think you should buy this game because the content that it has now is a few hours of good fun, however if the devs continue as they are, it could be possibly hundreds of hours of fun in the future."

And I'd kinda like it to have a solo setting (Yes you can create a room, and make it just have one person or be private, but still)Apart from those things, it's really fun, it can be rage inducing, and some of the custom options are neat. Shapes and low G are just the worst xD But a the worst in that everyone suffers together sort of thing. I'd say it's a nice option if you have a bunch of people that you game with and want to do something fun. I'd probably say it's a four person game at least!"

Seven months is a very long time. I excepted a bug like this to be solved. The bug that happend to me essentially prevents me from connecting to any golf with friends server. Or hosting one. I am unable to be detected by anyone and I can't detect any server. So I thought hmmm maybe they would fix this soon. I tried to go on recently and I still cannot access this game again. I was able to play this game for a period of time. This bug is also iffy as occationally I could still go on. But once I tried restarting steam several times and tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game which took me a full 2 hours and was still unable to play. I just uninstalled the game and until this game is out of early access I am not going to bother playing this again. So for now I have to give this product a 4/10. The 4 is still pretty high considering it's not a zero simply because when you do get to play it is farily fun."

Though you can't get a hole in one in every map without custom options or cheating, which is a bummer. but all the issues can be looked past considering this is a good time consumer to play with a pal.Someone put me out of my misery."

This game outshines all similar golf games i've seen on Steam; for example, I have really enjoyed playing rounds of golf where we have been acorns, cones, even Christmas ornaments causing some insane and funny rounds. Now that's only if you specifically select to have random ball shapes, but the game is still very fun, and with a new map and a level editor coming soon, this will be interesting to see what the developers plan and what players plan for custom courses."

,Recommended,431240,33747748,Posted: 23 July,all,Hartley Harms,"It's a very fun and interesting game.  Even though it's been out in Early Access for a while, I think it has a LONG way to go.  There's no individual hole practice, there's no way to change the music back to the way it was before, and I honestly feel that the difficulty spike after Forest is a *bit* much.  Some holes desperately need some technical tweaking to make their tricks make sense.All-in-all, it's a great game to have fun with your friends in, but it's nowhere near finished.  It's missing features you would expect to be in at launch, and instead of fixing bugs and tweaking holes so they're not so obscenely unfair, the devs are just spending time making new courses, which is fine, but there's basically no efficient way to practice any holes on those courses."
,Recommended,431240,34249751,Posted: 14 August,all,Rhetor1K,"Golf with your friendsor ""friends"" after your experience with this game.Is a game that takes the regular golfing format and revamps it into a casual, fun, rage inducing but more importantly a simplistically designed multiplayer golf game. Taking a very bold approach to changing the golfing format.This ""format"" is primarily changed through physics, as the golfing balls in this game are prepared to go to mars and back just to get into that damned hole. Although the physics revamp is definitely for the better: as it is more or less the sole reason that this game has sold so well. Regardless, like it or hate it; the physics are gonna have someone in your friend group screaming""♥♥♥♥ING UNREALISTIC PIECE OF♥♥♥♥♥♥GAME ARGHHH""One of the larger downfalls of this game is not having the largest map pool (6 maps each map having 18 holes each, totaling to 108 holes!)maths... whoooo!Although, I feel as if the lack of maps can be forgiven due to a LARGE replayability factor and alternate twists to each map. For example: a ""hoops"" mode which changes the game into a deluded basketball or ""custom"" allowing you to have an ideal golf game.Although let's be honest, you're just gonna turn collision on and tell no one simply to mess with the person on top.I think a way to counter this issue is allowing the community to have a map maker with a workshop for other users to browse, play and edit other users levels.This game is golden, that is if you have friends that are the type to say ""HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥IF YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT PASSING ME I'M GOING TO ♥♥♥♥ING STAB YOU"""

The first is that there are only a handful of maps, and it simply gets boring fast, I am sure this will change with updates however.  The second and largest reason is that it seems to be too difficult.  Let me explain: as with every golf game the goal is to get the ball in the hole in as few moves as possible and each hole has par, anything less is a good score and anything more is a bad score.  The problem is that it's almost impossible to hit the ball with the right amount of force because the ball either rolls a lot or a very little and is hard to get the exact force you want.  Secondly you have to be a perfectionist when playing, there are several holes where if you make one mistake you'll get over par.  There are also some holes where it is almost impossible to get under par because the hole is seemingly designed to make you go out of bounds or get lost.  I'm looking at you egyptian level."

Some holes are ridiculous and it's not always clear where you have to go to. Some things might be ramps while other things are traps, perhaps I am looking for more realism in Golf, personally I do not recommend this game unless you have friends to play it with, custom lobbies get fun. It's been a year since this game came out, it's really up to you whether you prefer artificial difficulty or just want to golf like me.Pro:Ball customization (Colors, Hats etc.)P2P Networking (No need to port forward)Con:Limited amount of courses (You can play them all within two hours, then the replay value goes down. I suggest that you play this game in small sessions or with friends to get the most out of it)Most holes have ridiculous traps designed not with difficulty in mind but just straight up luckNo Controller SupportYou will probably instantly mute the music once you get in a course.Tl;dr I cannot recommend this game until we fix one of these cons at least.

It's a fun game, but they didn't anticipate the number of people who would be joining during the steam sale. The servers constantly disconnect you, and they will claim it is your end and ask you to disable your anti virus software or open up about 20 different ports on your firewall. I've never had to do this, simply allowing peer-to-peer access would solve this issue.I shouldn't have to jump through hoops to make a game stay connected, early access or otherwise, admit that there's major connection issues with this game at the forefront.

Unfortunately, the Developers have not put much content in the game, and I understand it is in early access and only costs £4.79 at the time of writing this, but the game honestly does get boring after a few hours. I would only recommend this game if there are a lot more courses to choose from and if you have lots of people to play with.

You can argue that the custom options are fun to play with, but only a few times and after that it is boring.

76561198218757184,Not Recommended,431240,29403582,Posted: 21 January,all,Krullon184,"An incredibly buggy game that lacks basic features of a typical golf game. Great potential to be a good game worth playing, however the mechanics need to be fine tuned, bugs actually fixed rather than ignored, and features implemented to fix it up.As seen worst at its worst with the latest 'Candyland' map, there is a desperate need for a 'look-ahead' feature, because as somebody else has said in their review, it's just blindly shooting without any indication of what to shoot towards and where you'll actually end up. The Oasis map has a hole with a sort of ramp thing that looks horrid and is hard to know to hit the ball at it at power in order to progress, as it just looks like glitchy terrain with no indication of what to do, similarly with another hole on the same map, where you shoot seemingly randomly at one of two pillars and just hope your ball goes somewhere good.Two of the most common bugs are: 1 - your ball randomly collides with invisible hitboxes, throwing off your shot completely and massively screwing you over, for example on Oasis again, the hole with the 'S Bend' ramps with speed boosts, if you aim along the right wall, you won't progress. 2 - If you're on any sort of incline with mid-low momentum, don't expect to be taking another shot any time soon as your ball will most likely just keep rolling very very slowly, and as it's still moving, the game doesn't allow you to take another shot, so your best bet is to hope you have a timer on the holes so you can actually move on eventually, without having to close the game. This one is incredibly common and happens on near enough any map, just watch a YouTube video and chances are that you'll see it happen.To repeat; the game has great potential to be a fun game. It's simplistic and easy to play with just a simple drag and click to shoot. However it is incredibly buggy, and whether it's in Early Access or not, the devs should think about perfecting existing levels, particularly fixing the bugs that have existed since the very beginning, before adding more maps, changing existing levels, and creating many more bugs. Do not recommend."

This is a game where you use the mouse to click+drag in order to determine how hard you hit the ball. Astoundingly, the game has no option to adjust mouse sensitivity. So for me it is, quite literally, unplayable. Even with my mouse on the lowest settings, and my DPI turned down using external software, I can still only either hit the ball as HARD as possible, or so little that it BARELY moves. I am aware that this is a specific issue that will not effect 90% of the players out there. But it is INCREDIBLE to me that someone would make a game where it depends 100% on how hard you move your mouse, and not have a sensitivity option."

It's fun don't get me wrong, but being early access there are far too many game-breaking bugs that just ruin gameplay over-time. For example it randomly adding strokes to your score even though you aren't moving, or the COMPLETE randomization of how shots happen in random shape mode where literally you can do the same shot twice in a row and have a COMPLETELY different result happen, It's just too much. I mean it's not a bad game to get on sale but eventually it will make you want to kill yourself and everyone around you. MAJOR fixes need to be made."

I played a lot of golf and there always are pros an cons to make out in golf games. But this one does everything wrong. You get confused where to aim for cause there often are multible goal flags visible when you search for your way to shoot. the Physics are terrible and you just can't get a feeling for it because the camera is clipping all the time. When you try to change graphics resolution in the options like switching between windowed and fullscreen, your monitor just starts flashing and you have to reset your PC.This Game is in this state for many month now and I have given up the the believe that there will be anything fixed at the basics and there will never be any fun in playing this game.I only wish I could get my money back for buying something usefull. ..like toilet paper ....or even a Game worth playing."

I had forgotten just about everything from my previous play through, but it all came rushing back pretty much immediately. So much seems exactly the same.Things that jumped out right away:o Camera (or lack of) to see an overview of the hole you are on. I'd say by far this is the biggest annoyance of this game. Maybe I'm in the minority, but I feel like 100% of the enjoyment is lost when you sink the ball into a hazard that you don't even know is there. This trial and error is extremely frustrating. There should be an overview (top-down) button that is always selectable at the very least A flythrough camera would also be nice at least for the start of the hole, but a birds-eye view would at least give you an idea where you are even shooting for. It is a fundamental of the game to be able to see the course/hole to know what you are aiming for. This is so much more important (in my opinion obviously) than additiona courses or ball shapes at the moment. It is the one thing that makes me not want to play the game again.o No sound for striking the ball. Not only should it make the sound of hitting the ball, but it should also be louder based on how hard it is hit. Without this sound, it just seems weird (especially since hitting the ball into an object makes a sound). Very sterile and like the game is muted. The sounds could be realistic (like a ball actually ""pinging"" off the putter).. or more arcade-like with the sound of a swoosh of air and the driver whacking the ball. Just something to give it a little ""life"".o No visual or audio cue that the turn is over and the ball is ready to be struck again.o The stroke counter resetting to 0 immediately after sinking the putt. While yes, the score card is shown at that time, it still would be nice to leave the current stroke count at the bottom right of the screen until the hole is advanced. Since that is where you normally are keeping track during the game, it always seems odd when you sink the putt and glance to see what you got (something that is just natural), but just see a big 0 instead of your actual stroke total.o Ball is routinely covered by world geometry. While you can still see your power indicator, it is very jarring (and just plain looks odd) to try and aim a ball you can't see.I know this is still EA and you guys have been working on it quite a bit. Just giving my opinion again for that very reason..."

This game is not worth the $5.99 price tag.  The angles/physics, whatever you want to call them doesn’t work.  After many patches and updates I’m always hopeful something has changed but every time I come back to it, it’s just a letdown.  If that's not enough, the game is very laggy when playing with any settings that aren't default and it's not very enjoyable to watch or play for that matter.  Another thing that really steams my beans so to speak is the fact that there are 3 maps.  *Excuse me 4* So this game gets very boring/repetitive very fast.  If you're a fan of playing a game for maybe 10-15 minutes then great go for it but the longevity of this game is that of my sex life:  Non-existent.  If by now after reading this review you're thinking ""Hey, I'm a little hungry I could use something to eat.""  Go get in your car/bike/train/bus/uber/any means of transportation the world has to offer and take yourself to your local McDonalds and order the Large #1 meal.

Only one thing, I think I can't recommend this game, is its strange data.Friction and Power. Yeah, these two simple words destroy this game. I had played Mini Golf in real life when I visited MACAU, there is a park near the black sand beach. You can pay little money for borrowing golf club and ball. So if you know what is Mini Golf in real life, you will totally know why I complain about that two simple words. You are so powerful that you can hit your ball thousand miles away if there are no barriers to stop that ""running in the expressway"" ball. Meanwhile, that high-speed rolling makes Fricition be of little significance ( Or I can say, this game doesn't exsist that thing ). If the producer can't pay attention to these, I will keep my comment.Suggestion for player: Don't be serious about this game. If you really want to play Mini Golf, Tower Unite is much better.Suggestion for producer: improve the gameplay."

Surely I woyld have thought you just typed? But no, I couldn't get that to work either.In short, don't buy this game, even if you see it on sale, as it is just plain awful.Best Mini-golf game I ever played was Mini-Putt on the Commodore 64.

Not being able to see the hole before you play it is equally stupid. How are you supposed to know where to aim for when the game hasn't given you even a clue? There were times that the game made it look like you were aiming for what turned out to be a different hole entirely.

,Not Recommended,431240,23007542,"Posted: 15 May, 2016",all,:D,"When I first started playing with my friends we had a lot of fun. It was a nice and relaxing game you could play while talking to other people. Everyone was happy and we had a really good time. After playing for a couple of days we started to be more and more competitive which wasn't necessarily a bad thing. Instead of just playing, trying to have fun, we now focused on winning and beating each other. After a few more days things slowly started to go south and what started out as a fun activity became the reason why I lost most of my friends. We didn't play to have fun anymore, the only reason we played was to win and to find out who was better at the game. Death threats, insults and tears replaced all the joy we first experienced playing together. Over the course of time more and more of my friends started to quit the game because they couldn't deal with the fear of being humiliated anymore. To this day I still don't know what happened to some of the people I used to talk to on a daily basis, they simply disappeared and no one ever saw them again. I personally feel responsible to inform the public about the risk of buying ""Golf With Friends"", because it ruined not only my life, but the life of the people I was closest to as well. I'm dealing with severe depression and anxiety attacks on a daily basis because of the insanely competitive environment that surrounded me. I still recieve death threats and letters from people I won against because they want to take revenge. If you decide to buy ""Golf With Friends"" speak to your parents if you're not at least 18 years old and make sure they are aware of the possible long term effects this game can have on you. If you are old enough please take the time and ask yourself if playing a game is worth risking your health."

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS TO PLAY IT WITH.-The players that are online are usually just other people making private lobbies.CONCLUSION: (TL:DR)This game is pretty fun. It has a fun quirky environment and while it only has 2 maps it still offers lots of various holes to play in. However it still has a few gameplay flaws that can be alittle frustrating at times. The online multiplayer is still very undeveloped with only an average of 5-10 people on at a time. Hopefully this game can gain more popularity and increase the population of the multiplayer server. Until then, I repeat... DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU HAVE FRIENDS TO PLAY IT WITH, but if you do, this game is worth taking a crack at plus you can always refund it if this isn't your type of game.After coming back to this game 3 months later, it has improved alot! While I'm a bit disappointed there are only 2 maps still, the community has grown so much! I have decided to swap my review to positive for 2 reasons:1) Way more people playing now! (300 at 12AM!)2) Custom Settings (The best thing ever created)If you like the concept of MiniGolf, this game takes it and makes it way more competitve and hilarious! Definitely buy it if you have friends to play with!"

Controls are very easy and, with some more maps, this game will be a blast. So --> Only negative aspect: The few maps, which is basically fine at the Alpha point.Also, you can play this public (or alone :( ) but as many things, it is more fun if you have 1, 2, 3, or even 7 friends with you (might get chaotic with 8 players).Lastly, go and buy this game, it'll be worth every cent in the end.

Plus the levels itself are fun and creative in a way for you to srategize on how to hit your ball, based on where to hit, how hard to hit, and when to hit.

The fact that you can change the shape of the golf ball makes all the hard holes hard again. Trust me, although there are only 3 maps, some of these holes are really hard. This game has SO much potential. If the authors of the game ever read this review, I highly suggest that you not only add more courses, but also allow the community to add new holes/maps, ball styles, or even game modes. A game like this is perfect for what I call community development-a game where a large amount of content is based on adds by the community. I hope the devs take advantage of this as it would greatly improve the game. As a ""very early acces"" game, it feels like it is ready to go. If it was not in early access, I would not be disapointed, and for $6.99 for hours of fun, who would be."

In my opinion, on the hole you are on, the flag should stick out, like a different color from other holes that you are not on or currently finished.If this was real miniature golf then you would be able to see the layout of each hole, which this needs going forward for the reason mentioned earlier.Overall, it is a fun game and am curious where it is going moving forward.."

For under $10 this is a good pickup to play when you and your friends want some down time and have a relaxing yet very fun game. There are currently only 3 maps, Forest, Oasis, and Twilight. Forest feels like the map that introduces to the simple mechanics and gameplay that will be in the game. Oasis gets a little bit more nutty and encourages you to make more creative shots. Twilight is a love/hate relationship, very creative holes with a combination of frustrating ones that leave you out of strokes. Overall, very fun and I hope they add a community map editor so we don't have to wait for new updates to get more maps."

There are plently of maps to choose from and the UI is cool and really easy to naviagate and so easy to join/host a game.The only thing I would say is there is no easy way to search for current servers and I had to search through 21 pages to find the server I needed, but this game is still early access and I'm sure it will be implimented over time.On Startup, you get a nice configuration menu that gives you a list of resolution, a graphic settings of Low, Med and High and an option to window/fullscreen it.Overall, I recommend this game!"

There are only three courses right now, but as more and more are released (or better yet, a level editor??) the game will continue to be tons of fun.If you have a few friends to play with, I definitely recommend it. Looking forward to future updates.EDIT: Just wanted to update this review to say how much I appreciate the developers of this game. They are hard at work adding new features and fixing bugs while the game is in Early Access, so it's definitely not just some abandoned, ""take the money and run"" title.They are also very cheerful and positive with their news posts, which is nice :)"

If you want to play this game, have friends that have it, don't play alone.When everything is working great, the game is a lot of fun. The physics are a fun mix of relistic and stimulated, the ball jumping adds a great strategy spin on simply putting the ball to the hole, and the game has dedicated servers. The map design is pretty varied, but a little inconsistent. For as many good holes there are in this package, there is about half that are easily forgettable.Straight up, Golf With Friends completely follows the title. Play this game, with your friends. If you don't have any, don't buy this game. Without fun people to play with, this game is pretty much useless, and will get old incredibly fast. Which is fine, this game is meant to be a party game to play after a couple of drinks, and for that, it serves it's purpose. It's great for rage videos, it's a great simple game to get people to play (Even if they don't play games normally), it's pretty cheap, and it runs well on lower powered machines.Unfortunately, this is current a Early Access game, and with that comes issues. About half of the times I start a game with a friend on his personal server, the game stops responding and crashes. Luckily, this hasn't been a severe problem mid game, but it is most certainly something that can drive many mad. This game is also a work in progress, and has some missing content. As of 9.18.16, there is only three courses with 18 holes each. Each course features a different theme and setting, varying itself from the rest, but playing all three holes takes under a hour. AFter 2.8 hours in, I've mostly stuck with the forest course, as it has the least amount of holes with horrible design. For a game that costs money, it currently doesn't have enough holes, and for the holes it does have, it has a lot of bad ones."

The actual maps, physics, settings and all that is pretty bad. Funny how you can download golf games for free with hundreds of maps while this one had 3 maps for a half year in total and is not free to play. If the creator is alone/with few people they should instead of creating these big themes on each hole, instead just make many. Quantity is much better than quality in golf, my friends and I agree. We often end up with this after a long gaming night and laugh of how terrible we are. But seriously it's what 4-5 maps in total now, thats not good.

It's a really fun mini-golf game. I can see why it's in Early Access, it's definitely not finished yet. The 2 developers tend to fix what ever major problems the community runs into. This game won't appeal to many because it's in Early Access but once it is finished I am sure there will be lots of more players. If you really aren't patient, I wouldn't buy the game, YET. The ball sometimes tends to glitch where it slowly rolls and you can't shoot. There are other problems but I won't get into them because I am sure they will be fixed. Lastly, again, If you aren't a fan of unfinished games, obviously don't buy this yet. It may be a good idea to grab though since the price will go up at full release.Edit: They don't stream development of the game anymore due to internet issues.Edit: They are starting to stream again apparently."

But if you can handly the taste of salty rage on almost any give hole than I highly no not even, I strongly recomend this game. The gameplay is simple and easy to under stand which is good for a golf game and the graphics are beautifull to look at. Overall I give this game a 8.5/10 it's only 8.5 because of the differcuty spikes but thats what it needs work on. After all as of the time of this review the game is still in early access."

,Recommended,431240,32758259,Posted: 24 June,all,OgrePrincess,"As its name suggests, this is a very enjoyable game for spending time with friends. Being able to see how others on the course try - or attempt to try - to putt their ball can be really great, and gives perfect opportunities for taunting over mic/chat. The downsides to this game at the moment are the small amount of maps, tiny community (only bad if you don't have friends to invite to a lobby), and how getting into the game can be buggy sometimes. However, it is early access, so devs are still working on stuff like that. I would totally recommend this."

Single player mode is quite relaxing, as the holes are quite short, but it won’t be long before you try different techniques to achieve the hole in one.  Playing with friends is awesome, set up a lobby, invite your friends and let the inner competitive streak take over.  The graphics are great on low end machines and stunning on the more powerful ones, the courses are really well designed, unique and quite quirky, controls are super easy, so you can focus on having fun.There are a few glitches but they are more of an annoyance rather than detracting from the 'fun with friends’ element of the game.

,Recommended,431240,28925870,Posted: 1 January,all,Big Boss,"The LevelsCurrently, there are 4 different levels: Forest, Desert, Moonlight Park, Spooky Mansion. An additional 2 are supposedly planned.Each map contains 18 holes and at least in the forest level you can finish it with 18 shots - but this will take you a lot of practice.The design is really neat and most of the time you can take more than one approach to hitting the ball.With to the many possibilities comes a big part of the replay value and the whole fun of the game. If you manage that one insane hit, none of your friends even thought about and you leave them wondering how you managed the hole in 2 strokes when they are on the 7th.The GameplayIt's Golfing - as easy as it gets - you hold the mouse button, move the mouse to change the strength and direction of your shot and release to hit the ball.You can also zoom in and out to get a better idea of the location of your goal, but sometimes it is obscured by obstacles so you won't be able to see where to hit at all - I really wish there was a free camera so you could inspect the level beforehand.MultiplayerCreating and joining a lobby is super easy, as well as setting up modifiers.Another big part of replaying this game will come from setting up different modifications - such as 'random ball shapes'. When the unlucky one with the acorn hits the hole in one - a ♥♥♥♥♥torm will be unleashed :DHowever before even going into multiplayer, I advise you to paint your ball under 'Customize' - so you can be recognised by your friends. Just don't take the same colours.On the downside: you can't join a game through steam yet, which is a shame since you have to leaf through a few pages of games to find the one you are looking for.The VisualsAll the levels are really neatly designed and have a really cool air about them, to match a certain theme and bring you in the mood.The Forest, for example, is an all outside map, with a timber mill and saws and rolling logs around the place.The Desert features a pyramid theme with a sphinx and switches from an open-air level to an indoor level around the way.Moonlight Park is the currently only night level which has a really different feel from the other maps, it's quite magical.Last but not least in the mansion you will play all indoors and have ghosts spooking around as well as weird statues and trophies as well as cobwebs all over the place.However, in the current state of the game, some locations will just eat away your framerate - so you might have a look at your settings.The SoundI really like the sweet melody in the background, my friend, however, turned the volume way down because he couldn't stand it - so it's really a preference thing.The VerdictIf you have friends willing to play this game with you - by all means you can have a good time.However, there isn't that much content in the game yet. Of course, you can aim for the hole in one on every map (if this is even possible; I don't think it is), hone your skills by trying new hits and playing with funny settings but it depends on how long you and your friends will stay motivated together - because if the first one loses the interest, the others will probably follow.Also: always play with Collision - on. HateThank me later.Note:If you have read this far - thank you.I hope this review helped you in deciding to buy this game and if it did, I would be grateful for a 'thumbs up', if you didn't like it, you can give me a 'thumbs down' but I would be glad to hear your opinion on what you didn't like."

The devs are interactive with the community and do their best to stay on top of any issues that arise. The game is consistantly in my update list because of how hard the devs work.Keep up the good work, and we look forward to what else you have in store for us!"
,Recommended,431240,33566835,Posted: 15 July,all,Rusty,"Whether you'll see it as a good game or not depends on what you're looking for.It's mini golf with crazy, themed type courses. Think of mini Golf courses that sometimes feel like obstacle courses but exaggerated to at times extreme levels.You have the ability to customize the appearance of your ball (i.e., change the colour of it, give it a hat once you unlock said hat or even use silly things up to and including an acorn in place of a ball). This can work out to some pretty silly looking balls that hopefully will only get sillier once they add more options.Unlike other Golf games, when you aim and select the power level of your shot, you *won't* get an estimate of where your shot will land. You also cannot see an overview of the hole you're currently on, which can lead to ""where the heck am I aiming for?"" moments for some holes, especially when you're new to them.If you're someone that doesn't play a lot of Golf games but has (for example) played Golf in GTA V and enjoyed it, don't expect this game to be a similar experience. This is far more causal and (in my opinion and from my limited experience with it) is not a Golf game one will enjoy if you try it take it seriously and not getting a low score is something that will bother you.If you're someone that likes trick shots (i.e., bouncing from one thing to another to another etc.) some of the holes seem to beg for them. Doing a perfect trick shot is always awesome. However, since you can't survey the hole beforehand, it can often involve already knowing the hole and a lot of trial and error.In short, if you want a silly mini Golf game you can play with others (but also alone if you're like me and have no friends) that's easy to jump into, this might be worth your consideration.However, if you're looking to get low scores and to take it seriously and/or want something more realistic where you (for example) have to take into consideration which club you're using, wind speeds etc. then this may not be for you."

You play as a golf ball trying to get into the hole in each map. there are 4 maps and each map has a few levels. We beat them all in about 90 minutes.

I get that this game is in early accessPros:Very fun to playUnique map designsEasy controlsCons:Not knowing where to go; a lot of the time I'm left not knowing where the hole is at the start of the hole. It would be great if before each hole, we were shown where the hole isPars; It may just be me sucking, but I feel like some of the pars are way too low. It seems like in order to hit the par, you have to know where the hole is, and do everything perfectlyHills; There are a lot of maps with hills on them that just require the perfect amount of power to get up them. Especially the one hole on oasis with a giant hill and a hole in the middle. It is incredibly difficult to get your ball in the hole as you will most likely have too much or not enough power, and end up running out of strokesMaps: I know this is early access and they are still working on maps, but there are only 4 maps, and after playing through all of them, there really isnt a point of playing them againGraphics: The graphics really aren't the greatest. Especially the fire, which is a pixelated gif that looks like it's from 2008tl;dr This game is lots of fun, but not knowing where the hole is, running out of strokes because of a stupid hill, and the very small amount of holes leads to very short lived gameplay"

I was scepticle at first, however, a few holes in (and possibly a few complaints to the police) later and I found the game to be extremely fun. This is a game that you will get angry at, but it is the fun, freindship ruining, Monopoly type anger that you will laugh at in the end. The levels are really well designed, and very viberant, the Dev's are pretty on the ball with bug fixing, and the new content seems well designed and unrushed. This feels like a game that I can waste many hours on and possibly destroy many of my friendships with.Pros- Very simple game with entertaining content.- Good Devs who pride the game and their players.- Highly customizeable physics for wild shinanigans.- Multipule ways to play the game; either through standard casual play or pro MLG trick shots.- Good for anger venting. (Seriously, you might rage at this game)- Good difficulty progrettion between holes 1 through 18.Cons- Rage indusing (Would not reccoment playing regularly with ""salty"" companions).- No difficulty rating for individual courses (Not a huge thing but would be nice to have).- Can be tempermental with lower end gear. (Still playable if your computer is just below the mark, but you may have issue pulling off more flashy shots).- No way to implement a turn order, yet. (Again not a bad thing, but it would be nice to have an option in there for it. The chaotic everyone goes at the same time is nice, but there have been times where I have nudged/have been nudged by my opponent which messed up my shot. Needless to sday arguements insued.)SummeryFantastic game and I am looking forward to supporting this project to it's completion. The con's to this game are nore tiny specs hidden upon a glorious feast of fun. I would greatly recoment picking up this game for it's price. It is great value for money, and will deffinatly give you more than what you paied for. Gameplay is refreshing, quirky and fun.9/10 - Will do another review on game's release.Side note: There is currently no option for user creaded levels and/or Workshop content. I believe this wouyld be a fantastic feature to the game later on, once it nears a complete release. This does not take away from the game at all, however, I believe it would be a fantastic eddtion to have rateable user created levels to add to the already wacky and bizzare selection of mayhen the game has to offer."

I haven't experienced any performance issues at any time.- The graphics are pretty good for a mini golf game.- The controls are easy to learn and precise.- Wacky options like being able to make everyone have to use a cube instead of a ball make things interesting.Cons:- I wish there were more courses to choose from.In summary this is a fun little game that does exactly as it advertises. It's easy for you and a few friends to jump into a game and play some put-put."

Even when nothing is happening....at all.5) The Dunst: There is always one friend who cant keep up and finds every obstacle or pool of water somehowHowever it must be said if you have no friends you can play golf with strangers on a public game and who knows maybe you'll meet a friend...Overall this is a good simple game, very few courses at the moment but changing the physics of the courses and ball shapes gives viability.

It's hard to trust early access games as they are not fully complete, but I believe this one to be well worth it for the price at which I bought it. I can see this as having plenty of replay value as I look forward to trying all of the different customization options, and at the promise of adding new maps to the game, there could be plenty of variation in the game to keep it interesting and challenging.A few minor, nit-picky things: At some points, the ball does seem to lose some it's friction and glide a little easier, and, for some of the holes, I feel like the par number is a bit small in comparison to the area/size of the specific hole.I look forward to playing more of this, and I hope you will join the rest of us that have purchased this cool game!"

I would like to see steamworks implemented in the near future to allow custom maps, designed by the community, to be available on the workshop."

Definitely recommend to anyone that doesn't extremely hate mini golf. Actually no. Even if you do hate mini golf, give this a try because it is amazing.As for the feedback they want to help shape the full version of the game.... Can't really think of anything. A space level with aliens would be cool. Or an underwater level. Or a wild west one. Or some kind of East Asian one with temples and dragons etc. Or a safari one? ... These suggestions are probs worthless though as I imagine they already have plans for what levels the completed game will have...Maybe add a feature so that two (or more) people can play it on the same computer, doing each level in turns."

Well, here I am with six hours logged and three of my friends now have it because of me and we just. Rage at each other while playing minigolf. How great is that? Long distance friends who I can't REALLY minigolf with now have the opportunity to talk trash to me and lose at my mercy. Excellent.The game has it's bugs (some of the holes will just do weird things, it happens, early access) but they aren't frequent enough for me to be really upset about it. It's more just a. ""Huh that just happened."" And then my friends and I start cussing at each other.The different options and customization make replay value pretty awesome. Seriously just try every hole with the acorn ball. You'll hate yourself as much as you've always wanted by the end of it. The bounces and gravity adjustments make trick shots both hilarious and fun. And at times, they also make you literally want to put your foot through your computer monitor so. Y'know!I think it's worth the early access price. I can't wait to see the finished product, I'm sure it will then be worth the full price. I just hope they keep adding more content once they complete it, even if it's a Map Pack or something, y'know?

It has some bad physics to it but to me really doesn't matter it's just a REALLY fun BS game to play with others and it's in early access which means more things to come.  Lots of options, plays well with voice chat and other things.  It's just fun seeing my friends or myself yell at the game when BS happens.If anything, the game needs an option to view the map and look around when needed there are lot of blind spots on many of the courses and you need memory skills to know what lies beyond the course.Overall very fun game and I could play this hours on end."

It's one (sometimes two) guys working non-stop to develop this game, and they bring consistent updates. They have created 6 additional courses to play since the start, and are hard at work at a level editor. This game is super fun to play with friends, but I can see it being fun solo trying to perfect every hole. Although, for me, there's nothing more fun than playing a course with friends that no one has played before. Lots of laughs are had. And that's just with a normal golf ball and normal physics. Just wait to see what other awesome things you can play/accomplish with different game settings."

At the same time this can also be a pretty rage-inducing game (just turn on contact and watch as your so-called ""friends"" make it their mission to punt you off the face of the Earth).The levels are very well-designed, with a relatively high skill-ceiling for those who want to spend hours finding all the hole-in-ones (it's possible on almost every hole!)One minor criticism I have is there is a slight lack of maps. I do understand though that this is a new game and undoubtedly more maps will be added, so this'll probably be a temporary problem. The customisable game options give each map a good bit of replayability however.So yeah, nice and chill (unless your friends are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s), and a cheap, easy-to-run, well-made game!"

The ones with rules like ""Do not beat people with the golf clubs"" and ""Do not intentionally hit golf balls out of the course,"" who made their courses around those rules? Well forget everything you know about minigolf because this game is all about exploiting the course to your advantage. Watch as you aim ridiculously far off from the course, bounce your golf ball off some scenic object, off another scenic object, through one more scenic object, straight into the hole. You will get frustrated, you will laugh, and you will master the art of minigolf.It's a good purchase for $6, buy it."

,Recommended,431240,33843284,Posted: 27 July,all,Polish Dog,"Miniature golf on Steam, what’s not to like?Pros:+ Unique courses and game modes that separates this game from other golf games.+ Connecting with friends and players online is fairly easy and there has been little to no connection issues playing with friends from all over the country.Cons:- The learning curve is very steep. Of the six courses available (at the time), only one was suitable for beginner/intermediate players. With the other five ranging from challenging to frustratingly hard. And a handful of the holes in the courses will rely on precise geometry and “parkour-like” trick shots to make it to the goal as opposed to playing like a real miniature golf hole. I’m not asking for them to make the game easier, but I am asking for them to offer a more wider range of difficulty among the courses. Have a handful of relatively simple and easy courses as well as “medium” or moderately challenging courses to accompany the more difficult ones.Overall: A decent game for what it is now, still an early-access game in development but it looks like they have some good ideas for future updates. If you have friends who would enjoy playing this with you, I recommend you and them buying this game."

,Recommended,431240,34701101,Posted: 2 September,all,Swine,"This game is a good game, for what it is. There is a quaint feeling of nostalgia when playing this game. It reminds me a lot of ""Over the Hedge: Hammy Goes Nuts!"" This game does appear to be lacking a bit in graphical quality compared to the game, and is definetly lacking the main character, Hammy. Nonetheless, I would say this game is definetly fun when played with friends. I would like to see in future updates an option to have a player hitting the golf ball, with enough customization options to make my character look like Hammy from ""Over the Hedge: Hammy Goes Nuts!"". What would really sell me on buying this game for all my friends is a story mode, like in ""Over the Hedge: Hammy Goes Nuts!"". Right now there is no objective, and no Hammy.Overall, I would rate this game 3 Nuts out of 5."

We played each of the levels a few times and played with some of the customizable options. This game really is a lot of fun but you will run out of levels to play. At the time of this review there are I think 5 levels and unfortunately theres just not enough content to keep you going. My only complaint about this game is the lack of levels currently available which seems only temporary. If you are looking for a simply mini golf game look no further because this fits nicely

Want to paint your ball your favorite color and have it wear silly hats? Go ahead! Is normal minigolf not challenging or frustrating enough for you? Play a custom game, where you can turn your ball into different shapes that affect how you hit it, and turn on things like low gravity, collusion, and more! Starting to get tired of vanilla minigolf? Try the new dunk game mode, which turns the game into both minigolf and basketball!Right now it has six different maps you can play, and It gets updates every now and then for more maps and bug fixes. A minor gripe I have is that I wish there was steam workshop support for more maps and such. Other than that though, I really like this game, so thumbs up."

,Recommended,431240,35483217,Posted: 4 October,all,hazzaricks,"Golf with Your Friends is everything you want in a casual game. It's amazingly fun on multiplayer and I've already racked up 32 hours on the game since getting it in late August. I love casual games and Golf with Your Friends manages to achieve that perfectly and despite being early access, it's still an incredibly fun and creative product bursting with life.My only criticisms come from three aspects of the game which I feel might be fixed by the time this game is fully released:1. A restart option needs to be available in Classic. Many achievements rely on playing in Classic and when I'm trying to achieve par with a friend online, once we realise we won't get par or under, we have to 'Retire' and then set up a lobby again.2. The game can be very glitchy. The ball can sometimes just randomly stop, get stuck in terrain when it shouldn't (Haunted's carpet floor is particularly bad for this). Likewise, on Twilight's final hole, once you reach the floor, your view is impaired with either water or blackness. This obviously needs to be fixed but I have every faith that these problems will be sorted.3. Haunted isn't fun. This game is meant to be a challenge, but it's also meant to be fun - discovering new trickshots and cheats,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off your mates by getting THAT ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t hole-in-one etc. Whilst all the other courses manage to brilliantly balance between challenge and fun, Haunted is just a mess. It's almost impossible to score a hole-in-one and everything is just very awkward and frustrating. There is nothing wrong with an annoying hole, but Haunted is too difficult and there is nothing fun about playing it in my opinion.Other than these three aspects, this game is frankly excellent. A brilliant early release which I can't stop playing. I cannnot wait until we get the full game with the level editor and more courses."

Don't play with competitive friends unless you want to put that friendship in serious jeopardy."
