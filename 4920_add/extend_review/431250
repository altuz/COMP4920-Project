The morale system is introduced at level 11, forges at level 14, the possibility to transform buildings only at level 17.--IF you want to judge the game fast take a look at the ""how to play"" section where mechanics are well explained and, maybe, try them immediatly in a skirmish map (even tho campaign does a better job by introducing them step by step, just maybe you'll need more than 2 hours...)--In my experience, I've NEVER found any game similar to this that has the same strategic depth (from Galcon to Eufloria to any other free flash game on the net or android and apple stores), that in comparison always felt boring to me.This game is a pearl.Easy to get in, but a lot of strategy and fast-thinking involved at high levels.How it works: is a simple, fast paced RTS game with 2D cartoonish graphics. All happen in a single screen, where 2 to 4 factions fight over the control of all buildings (conquest mode) or key buildings (king of the hill and domination modes).A match last an average of 3 minutes, but may be virtually infinite (i had 30 minutes long matches).Controller commands: (Xbox / PS)left stick: select buildingRB/R1 (hold) + left stick: select targetB, A, X, Y (circle, X, square, triangle): send 25%-50%-75%-100% mushroomsLB/L1 (hold): open upgrade panelWhen in upgrade panel:A/X: upgrade buildingX/Square: transform into houseY/Triangle: transform into forgeB/Circle: transform into towerDouble tap A/X: upgrade building.

,Not Recommended,431250,33164322,Posted: 2 July,all,Blueberry,"Flash games much like this exist for free, anyway Got about halfway through till I was completely bored with it. I somewhat enjoyed the conquest by numbers, however theres a mechanic that completely ruined the experience for me. It's called the morality system.Basically if you successfully defend or upgrade some buildings your morality goes up. When it increases, troops defend buildings better and become stronger. The main problem with this is that it punishes players who attack first and can expand faster. You're forced to attack second if you want a gaurenteed victory. You wait until the enemy attacks, get your moral boosted than go on offense and steal a building and repeat.Scenarios take forever because you just wait and wait and wait for the enemy to make a move, you have to wait for the enemy moral to go down, you have to wait until your troops fill back up. And it ultimatly becomes a waiting game. It's a decent game, not worth $11.Also theres no one to play multiplayer with."

79542197291297985,Recommended,431250,22439392,"Posted: 15 April, 2016",all,Kitten,"The gameplay of Mushroom Wars is pretty simple. You command an army of mushroom warriors who are housed in mushroom structures. You can command 25%, 50%, 75%, or all mushrooms of a selected structure to attack or move to another structure. Although simplistic, this can get really interesting when dealing with a large number of villiages and a variety of structures.The devs said they were inspired by a game called Galcon, and games like Modern Conflict and Planets Under Attack took a lot of inspiration from Mushroom Wars. So if you are familiar with those other games, you might have a decent grasp of how Mushroom Wars plays.The campaign is 30 levels (with a few being simple tutorial missions), and compete against enemy AI who sometimes have a tactical advantage from the start. Initially I was annoyed by this, but since the AI is nowhere near the competance of another human player, I found that the difficulty was actually pretty fair. This actually led to some of the later levels almost feeling like a puzzle to me, forcing me to decide which enemy structures to take out first in order to not get overwhelmed by the AI's larger numbers. Overall it's a decent campaign, although a little short.Other than the campaign there are skirmish and multiplayer modes. Skirmish is what it sounds like, you're given a selection of symmetrical maps where you can compete against AI. I can't say anything about the multiplayer unfortunately, as it is not availible at launch. This may be a deal breaker for some considering the short campaign, and that's understandable. However, the devs have promised that multiplayer will be availible for free in a future update. I'll update my review then.The PC Port itself works fine. There aren't many graphical options beyond resolution and vsync, but that's all that's necessary for a game like this.Overall, Mushroom Wars is a fun little indie game with surprising depth despite its simplicity. I would say that it's worth $10, especially when it recieves its multiplayer update."

,Not Recommended,431250,33248960,Posted: 4 July,all,Count Cocofang,"So YEARS back, I played this browser game called Civilizations Wars. It worked pretty much the same way: Your buildings generate people and you command them to bash their heads against enemy buildings until only one clan is left.What Civilizations Wars didn't have was an upgrading mechanic for buildings. What you captured is what you got. The controls weren't as good, to select multiple buildings you had to keep your mousebutton pressed and mouse over all the ones you wanted. And it always sent out half of the men in a building.What Civilization Wars DID have however, were spells that you could use, perks you could upgrade for your clan, boss battles, slightly different clans, later versions had heroes, and more. Additionally the maps looked really pretty compared to the bland, flat ones here and the art style had a nice touch.This made for a more engaging game over a longer period of time. On this one, I got bored about an hour in. I played the maps on hard in hopes of unlocking something, but the ""rewards"" were just little achievement icons.The gameplay is so basic, that I didn't feel like investing any more time. A free browser game series has much more to offer."

Basically you conquer mushrooms, which then produce mushroom men and allow you to conquer more mushrooms. Every map is pretty much the same: Conquer more mushrooms and produce more mushroom men than your opponent. There are some maps with other type of goals, but even then it typically boils down to numbers.Wouldn't pay 10 euros for it, but if you get it cheaper might be ok buy to kill few hours of time."

,Not Recommended,431250,26378418,"Posted: 2 November, 2016",all,Horten,"It's good, but i cannot recommend it.reasons:-Developers work at the rate of Nexon. Their main motive is money, with as little work as possible.-Map size is fixed-No custom maps-No map size variety-No players online-Morale System is broken and you can become up to 2.5 times stronger than your opponent (wtf?)225% defence, 25% more attack damage, 50percent more movement speed at 5 stars. So just let your opponent attack and gain your defence stack to win.-It is one of the easiest campaigns for an RTS game because of broken morale-The morality system is broken, as defending is the ONLY way to win. Essentially whoever gets the most bases at the startwill be the winner if they know how morale works. It is easy to win a game with 100 units, against 300 if you defend and the opponent disregards morale. You'll learn this in their campaign on hard difficulty how OP morale is.The game is fixed around this broken Morale system. A lot of things will have to change, and at the rate these developers work, it's never going to get accomplished. That is why they are making a second game which is going to be a cash grab and have the same broken morale.I've got over 50 hours on the phone version and all pro's play the exact same which is not what RTS games are about.The use of forges become obsolete against Morale and unit production, since those without morale want forges, but also units. There is no compromise.I can write a blog on this, but that would be more work than it took to make this game.Conclude:I would recommend this game, as I still enjoy it on the phone exploiting morality, but after paying for this I know I won'tspend another cent towards these cash grabbers. Bad developers in charge of a good idea for a game."

I've played through the game several times over the years and it really is one of my all time favorite games. Originally I had it on PS3 and it was by far my favorite title there. Why do I enjoy this game so much?It's a real simple game about using troops efficiently by either defending structures or attacking unguarded ones. The best weapon at your disposal is the element of surprise and a lot of patience. If you rush into a building odds are that the enemy will guard it with ease. Sadly the pvp seems to be pretty much dead at this point but for the price you still get a terrific campain with diverse missions and when you're done with that there is a reasonable amount of skirmish maps.On this account I have beaten the campain on hard once and all the skirmish maps and I'm in for a good 10 hours. It took me way longer to beat it when I was new to the game though so you can count on being entertained for quite some time after that.The visuals are amazing, the gameplay is fun and fastpaced and the soundtrack gets stuck in my head in a good way.
