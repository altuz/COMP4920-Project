,Recommended,431260,35393721,Posted: 1 October,all,Chudah,"Surprisingly, I enjoyed Cursed quite a bit.  Granted, the story wasn't great, but I've played plenty of HOGs/adventure games with much less coherent writing that are just as campy and cliche, if not more so.  At least it was fluent with a plot that made sense despite being pretty ho-hum.  The gameplay was enjoyable enough, although I found myself missing the occasional hidden object scene.  Ultimately, you spend most of the game finding key after key after key, but I was okay with that as long as I was given beautifully painted locations to search through. And the artwork is indeed beautiful!  It's definitely worth it for the gorgeous graphics and monster design alone (there's some really awesome looking uglies in this one).  Just don't expect too much of the story and you'll be fine."

Very beautiful background and objects designs, Very focused main story line without too many side quest distraction,  but it is NOT a hidden object game. There is not a single hidden object scene in the entire game. The achievements is easy to get though out the game. Just right puzzle difficulties. Overall really great game."

As a point and click adventure it falls a bit flat.  Even though I locked my inventory bar, it would keep vanishing and I'd dutifully lock it again.  This happened constantly through the game.  At one point, every piece of the amulet I was collecting parts of showed back up in my inventory, unclickable, but really cluttering things up.This is a pretty sloppy game, and between the bugs and lack of features and polish we have come to expect from these sort of games, thanks pretty much to one company, I would suggest holding off on this one.  JetDogs is not terribly far from making good point and click games, but they aren't there yet.**edited for typo**"

This game has so much going for it; it's beautiful, the story is interesting, the voice acting is good, but it just isn't a great game. The game play consists of 'take object A and move to next screen to place it'. There are very few actual puzzles and it's all just so easily fixed! Make it a hidden object game or make more puzzles. It's either way too obvious or there are areas that you don't realise are areas. No explanations are given for what tasks are sometimes (the non obvious ones)I really think this could have been amazing, but it fell short."

I'll take your resolute silence as confirmation in the affirmative. In which case, THIS is the game for you!Cursed plays almost exactly like a hidden object game in that you'll pass from one screen/location to the next, gathering up random bits and bobs and solving puzzles through haunted mansions and shacks and towers and the like whilst trying to thwart some evil threat in the process, but it deviates by doing away entirely with any form of actual hidden object scenes. Instead, you'll just find the items strewn around the environments and the challenge is to figure out where and how to use them.There's a story about a bride-to-be and her absent fiancée being tricked into working for forces with wicked intentions, but let's be honest, when's the last time anyone's played one of these types of games for the story. It's the same as every other and entirely throwaway and forgettable. Although, having said that, the cutscenes are far better than the story deserves and are surprisingly well drawn and animated. In fact, the overall artistic quality is higher than I'd typically expect from these types of games, and if anything, kind of made me wish there were actually some hidden object scenes as I would've loved to have seen what the artists would've produced. But even without them, it's still a largely fun and entertaining game.There's only a couple of hour's worth of content here, and most of that will more or less be spent in exactly the same way - poking around from screen to screen to find the litany of keys and emblems to open up new objects and areas - but even so, the overall quality of presentation manages to elevate it from decent to pretty damn good. Though whether or not the full asking price is worth it or best bought on sale or in a bundle, I think only you can really decide that worth for yourself."

The story is ok, but I had to play through it twice to beat it because the game kept getting bugged out during the first run-through.  I had gotten stuck and couldn't complete it.  Even though I had recovered all of the amulet pieces, the count still showed one missing (though it was there on the map).  Very frustrating!  After a certain point, my inventory filled up with the amulet pieces -- seriously, what was the point of that?  This game's structure is sloppy and still has bugs.  It's short and not really all that challenging.  I noticed no difference between advanced mode and regular.  Granted it didn't cost as much as other HO/PAC games, but you'd be better off spending money on another one."

,Recommended,431260,25519062,"Posted: 15 September, 2016",all,adam1224,"Cursed is a little interesting genre-wise - it's basically a Hidden Object Game without hidden object scenes - it's like a really light point and click game, but best to be compared with HOGs.Soon after starting the game, I remembered one of the rooms from the developer's Dracula's Legacy game - and that made me worry, as I played the game, and noted quite some flaws in it, starting from questionable UI choices to mispellings and lack of polish in the game's second half.But to my surprise, the problems are gone. I'm not sure if all, but there are numerous small, but meaningful difference between the two games. Finally I can lock my inventory, and don't have to pet the lower side of the screen to access my items. The back button in the lower right is in the proper corner, unlike previous game's where the *exact* corner was empty, so you couldn't just fastly go back, you had to aim at it, and at the same time they reduces the ridiculous size of clickable areas to a more realistic, but still generously sized ones. The animation is incredibly good throughout the whole game, amongst the very best I've seen in similar games, the game lacks the mispellings the previous one had - I really liked the developer's Frankenstein game, and despite it's short length, I was really content with it. I'm really happy that they again made a game that was a similar joy to play.The best thing in the game, in my opinion, was the narration and the setting of maybe late 18th century, based on the use of language. They use a more lavish english, definitely older styled, and while finding note after note from the main character's fiancé could be boring, they were presented in a way that he was standing, and saying the letter's content, while it scrolled in the background. I can't put my finger on it, in what series or movie I've seen a similar presentation, but it fit to the game perfectly, and added to it's little cheesy old-fashioned style.And the fact, that the game was (and very likely will be) discounted to 0.5€, just made this an ever better purchase - it was a short, but all-around really well done game."

This same problem happened in one of the very first scenes, where i had to click at least 25 times to hit just the right pixel on 5 or 6 boards blocking a door. It didn't happen again after that, so i thought it was a one-off bug until the nameplate thing. So i'm stuck 93 minutes in and can't proceed because of a click-zone bug. Terribly frustrating.Up until that point, i was enjoying the graphics, the animations, the music, and the voice-overs (except that they sometimes got sorely out of sync with their subtitles). The story's a bit odd, and people leave things laying around in weird places, but it's not bad in that regard (just odd). But, as mentioned above, getting stuck due to an obvious graphical glitch (missing/broken click-zone) is completely inexcusable. Face. palm.If an update gets posted sometime this year i'll try again (provided i don't have to restart the whole thing), but the devs don't appear to be responding to posts in the forum, so i've got little hope that they're aware of/will fix this.EDIT: GOT IT: that last screw came loose when i clicked about 50-60 pixels below, and 20-30 pixels off-center, to the right, of the screw. i swear, i had to spend more than 5 minutes on that one single screw, though.But i can't recommend this title, for that single (inexcusable) reason until/unless they publish a fix. A shame, actually, because i'm quite enjoying it aside from the mis-clicks.EDIT: a while after the above ""EDIT"", it misbehaved again and the amulet (the game's McGuffin) cannot be assembled. i give up. It's a gorgeous game, but the bugs have ruined it for me."

I only played it twice because the first time I did not check the ""Advanced Mode"" and didn't get any achievements.

But, by the gods, the voice acting is more wooden than the Amazonian rainforest.Long version:Probably the best way to describe Cursed is that it is a monster hunting point ‘n’ click adventure game, which is so casual that its challenge level practically drifts into nothingness.Despite not being a hidden object game, Cursed carries quite a few elements associated with that genre. This includes the plot itself: a worried bride is looking for her missing fiancé, who is held captive in a mansion filled with Universal movie monsters. So, she does the natural thing of finding weapons to murder each of these monsters until she reaches the end credits. And I would swear that one of those weapons is her voice acting.Gameplay is so easy that Cursed could almost be viable as an education game on casual adventures. It has a large gameplay area but only a handful of actual tasks, so most of the time is spent travelling. Even with this, it barely lasts two hours at most, but at least those are two very laid-back, fun little hours."

That saves precious time, both for those who like them, and those who don't, and that's my little secret for having managed to collect a few hundreds of perfectly-visible-object games so far.Don't get me wrong, It's not that I don't like them at all. It's that suffer from a very rare disease, called randomclickophobia. So, you can only imagine my frustration, when I first started this one and I encountered a hidden object game interface.But to let you understand exactly how this one (almost) eluded me, I have to reveal my second bias: (do I need to say TL;DR ?)You see, I believe that games should be made in Linux and played in Windows.Linux provides all the tools for free, to make a developer's life easy, and Windows has the majority of customers and gets all the support from hardware manufacturers. Mac comes third (sorry), for those large companies that can afford spending some tens of thousands of dollars just to buy machines to test it. This game was the first I know to satisfy my superstition, so I really had to buy it. (well, if it costed 30$, it wouldn't be THAT necessary).Fortunately, beyond my initial embarrassment, being determined to give it a second chance, I discovered a game of the not-so-well-hidden-object-after-all genre, and quite a pretty one, actually. Well, it's not Skyrim, apart, perhaps, from the sparse draconic figures. You could say it's more like a Tomb Raider, without the guns, and the jumps, and the animations, and the sexy female protagonist. Although this one has a sexy voice, and is more reluctant about killing wildlife, be it mutated, or not.But its puzzles are decent (if not challenging), its graphics appealing (despite static), its voices well spoken, and it's atmosphere rather persuasive, depending, mostly, on the state of lights when you play it. Cursor highlights usable objects, so no frustrating click-all-overs are needed. It's a pleasant and relaxing experience, overall. (although I don't know if it is considered to be an advantage for a horor game).Having bought it for 0.49, I had a hard time deciding whether to check that I received it for free, or not. Then again, prices are relative, and the cost of an unfinished coffee that one leaves at a cafe, might be a day's salary for another."

While I don't believe the story is unique on its own, it held my interest until the end. The graphics and voice acting were well done. Fed some hungry wolves, shot down a bat, serenaded a snake, slaughtered the cutest little creature, went sailing, harpooned a demon for blood, and more. Was a nice little adventure.My only con (this applies if you’re a badge collector) the game is rather short, yet drops 8 cards. I ended up leaving the game up to finish collecting the drop cards even after I finished it.

It was a fun experience for me though, and I'll recommend it in case someone else might enjoy it for the same reasons. Disclaimer that I haven't played any other hidden object games since I was a kid, so I don't really know the standards for the genre.I enjoyed Cursed in the way I might enjoy a haunted house attraction around Halloween. It isn't about being frightened, seeing an amazing narrative, or even being immersed. It is worth it for those who like horror to experience the spooky atmosphere and enjoy the well-done props and art. Same for Cursed. The story is far from the worst I've seen, plausible but cheesy at times. There are some bugs, I only encountered one that was easily bypassed but some people have had worse ones. The puzzles and hidden objects I assume are standard for this genre and not really special, and the gameplay could be boring if you're uninterested in the scenery and visuals that play out.But as a fun showcase of skeletons and ghosts and cursed books and demonic critters, it's not a bad time. I got to sit down after work one evening and spend a few hours exploring a nicely visualized game, I got to chuckle at some cool creatures, melodramatic ghosts, and a charmingly nonchalant main character exploring a bizarre estate like it's nothing. The illustrations are nice, the atmosphere is an enjoyable romp through classic horror imagery. Nothing truly frightening (only once did it get me to jump in my seat, curse you tree goblin) but only what I could describe as a pleasant day trip through a haunted house.So for that I liked playing it and would recommend others to play it too, maybe not for everyone at full price but I'd encourage you to try it on sale if it looks interesting to you. With the right expectations this is a nice couple of hours, an easy 100% achievement game, and some fun horror emoticons, profile backgrounds, and achievements if you're into Steam's profile customization."

That's not to say that there aren't a few new puzzles here, or that even the repeated puzzles aren't still fun, but throughout the game, you'll get very similar feelings you'd gotten if you've played Frankenstein Master of Death; it has the same horror-esque type of atmosphere as the previous game. Regardless, I found that I enjoyed solving the puzzles as they were neither too difficult nor too easy but a little bit of both while leaning more towards easy than hard.What I was surprised at was the complete absence of any Hidden Object sequence; yes, you collect items as you progress throughout the game, like you do in most Hidden Object games, but you never come across any true Hidden Object mini-game.. so it does feel sort of deceiving to have ""Hidden Object"" as one of the tags of this game. If that's specifically what you're looking for, then this game isn't for you.Most of the time I was playing the game, it was on a crash-fest. The more I progressed through the game, it seemed like it crashed even more frequently. Like every 30/60 mins or so. Quite frustrated, finally I checked off the ""Full Screen"" option from Options and it seemed to have solved the problem, it isn't the ideal way to play the game, but at least it allowed me to actually *play* the game.The storyline and voice-acting are okay. They seem to be using the same two voice actors to play different roles and you can tell by how similar the voices are. But overall, the writing is average and it uses already established and overly used plots of the genre; ""your partner gets kidnapped in strange circumstances, it's up to you to save them, wow look at these weird surroundings.. isn't this scary?!"" type of thing.Overall, I recommend this(if it's on sale)to anyone who's into casual puzzle games but not to someone who thinks they'll be getting a Hidden Object game, for that you should check out: Frankenstein Master of Death or better yet (for way better voice acting and Hidden Object game as a whole) Brink of Consciousness: Dorian Gray Syndrome."

Next is a small bit of dirt that obviously hides something, but she won't dig with her hands, because that's what peasants do. A bit later you come across a glass bowl with a key and a crab in it, but you can't smash it or reach in with your hand or anything, so I'm going to assume you need some string and a hook to get the key out of it because of point and click logic.But if there are tentacles coming out of a chasm next to a blue glowing crack in the ground with several dead animals around it she suddenly has the courage to take a closer look to check out what create the tentacles belong to...The story started of weird. The main characters husband gets a job offer to renovate an ancient building and gets paid so much that he and the main character will never have to work again and can enjoy a life of luxury. Of course he instantly accepts without any question and goes missing. Without even trying to contact any form of authority (a police department, a local private investigator, whatever), she decides to go in after him instantly. I stopped caring about the plot at that point.The game looks nice, but tries way too hard to scare you. When you open the gate at the start a man appears and gets quite the close up. After you get to a mansion a girl appears and tells you to find a book after which she turns into a character from Nightmare before christmas.tl;dr same point and click logic as ever.

For me, it's like 2,5/10. Or, if you find it on sale like me (0,50 € instead of 5 €), then you can add one point, so 3,5/10.How to start this review? Well, i want to say that i love point and click adventures. Usually short games (under 5 hours), in which you have to use brain a lot, many puzzles, nice story, sometimes a plot twist. Pretty visuals, maybe animations and cutscenes, good atmosphere, soundtrack, etc. Cards and achievements are nice bonus.But this game. Ehm. To describe this game with one word: disappointment.Yeah, it is a point-and-click adventure. You can finish it in 2-2,5 hours, witch all achievements, without hints, etc. The problem is, that there are almost no puzzle. You don't need brain for this adventure (like, seriously, 4 puzzles in whole game? And to ""kill"" final boss, you have to solve 4x4 sudoku. Ehm.).What's next? Story? Well, there is some, but really unoriginal, bullsh*t story, the only horror part is demon and skeletons, bats, old house. And one jumpscare (but it is maybe my fault, i did not notice that it is ""horror"" game).Okay, so almost no puzzles in this game. But it is still adventure, you need your brain to continue in story and finish it. Well, you don't. There is absolutely no logic in this game. Plenty of locations, but almost nothing to do there. Go to that location, pick item 1, go to another location, use item 1 to open a box, there's item 2, which you have to use in another location. And, that's it. The sad part is, that locations are totally random, there's no logic in that how the item 2 appeared in that box.Oh, there's also awful controls. Inventory? On the bottom of screen. But, it automatically hides after 2 seconds. How to go back to the previous location? Click on the bottom of screen. See? Inventory just popped out. You want to use some item from inventory? Well, maybe you will go back to previous location instead :)What else can this game offer? Nice visuals, cutscenes, atmospheric sounds and music. And bugs. To be honest, i had only problems with subtitles, not synchronized well. But if you check the discussions part on Steam, you can find that many people had problems with this game, and not small ones, but really big, like unable to take some items = unable to finish the game.So, yeah, that's it. As i've already said that, you can buy it while on sale, but it is not worth the full price. 5€ for 2hours gameplay, with a chance to find gamebreaking bug (= unable to finish the game), and with no replayability. Just not worth. There are plenty of games like this, which can offer much more. So, keep looking :) And buy this one only if you are totally desperate, that you've already completed all point-and-click adventures on steam :)PS: i don't know why this game has 80%+  score on steam. But maybe i can understand. If casual gamer (who played only 2-3 point-and-click adventures in his life) finds this game for 0,50 €, he could say it is good. But this isn't a hidden gem, just some average adventure (when you close one eye)."

Well, to be honest, it's a hidden object gamewithoutany hidden object puzzles.By that I mean that if you're familiar with hidden object games, everything about this game will remind you of them - the art, the animation, the plotline, the voice acting - but, as I said, there isn't a single hidden object puzzle to be found in this game. That is, unless you count one where the items are all hidden in a regular scene, as opposed to a HO interface. The game did only last two hours, but overall I guess I enjoyed the experience. For fifty cents, I don't regret it. I still can't recommend it, though. I will say that the art, while a little dreary, is beautiful and there are some truly creative creatures in it. I liked the spooky atmosphere, too, though it was a little light. If you play through, be prepared to use that hint button. I generally try to avoid using it in HOGs, but there's WAY too much backtracking in the game to not resort to it now and then.I should also mention that I use Linux and when I first purchased this, I couldn't get the audio to work correctly. I got a refund for it as I found it unplayable and the developers were unresponsive. Hey, fifty cents is still fifty cents.

,Not Recommended,431260,31509398,Posted: 2 May,all,Arcaneshield,"Alright so first off, I've never played one of these 'Hidden Object Games', as the demographic for such has, as far as I was concerned, been pretty much middle aged women. I do enjoy point and click adventure games but generally the likes of Curse of Monkey Island have a bit more substance to them than hidden object games. I actually initially found this game while looking for all cthulu-related games and apparently this one showed up. There is one tentacled' monster but it most certainly has nothing to do with cthulu mythos. It is, at best, mildly spooky even for the intended audience.The voice acting is tolerable though corny and the art is certainly nice looking though the manner in which they did some of the 'motion' looked a bit janky. Dissolving between two still images and slightly swaying them side-to-side does not spooky animation make.The puzzles usually consist of finding item a to use with slot b (they're really big fans of shape-based locks), rinse repeat. There are some amusing moments where the character slays some creepy beast but from a gameplay standpoint it is the exact same as using item a on area b. There are a few legitimate puzzles but they're not particularly fun, though I recall the skull and thread puzzle to be oddly satisfying even if there was little rhyme or reason on how to complete it and you mostly just moved them around.There is some attempt at horror and I suppose for the genre it could be considered mildly spooky but my own mother wouldn't be the least bit spooked by any of this game so I doubt you'll get much actual 'horror' from it. The story is also terribly predictable and if not for the interesting and beautiful visuals I wouldn't reccommend this game even to the most diehard hidden object game fans.I think my biggest gripe with the game is how nonchalant the lead character is towards all the goblins and ghoulies and clearly overtly supernatural mumbo jumbo happening around her. Granted it's not actually scary but she seems not to question a single thing in the entire game. Perform a blood ritual? Sure thing! Shoot the scary bat thing that looks like a demon from hell? Just another day in the life of a vaguely victorian betrothed woman! Later in the game the situations got so legitimately ridiculous that when coupled with the character's complete lack of response to pretty much anything I found myself laughing out loud.So after all was said and done I managed to get about two hours of 'gameplay' into this thing. Someone less adept at problem solving might meander around enjoying the scenery for another half to full hour. Make no mistake, for five dollars canadian this was at least a mildly entertaining use of my time and money but I wouldn't reccommend this game to any but legitimate fans of the genre. If you don't usually play hidden object games, like myself, I doubt there's anything here to give you a wow factor.At least the plot was about saving the world... and not finding your grandma's missing recipe."

I finished the game in Advanced Mode in just over 2 hours, without rushing through or using Hints or Skips. The remainder of the time played shown on my account was just idling to get the TC drops.No replay value. None at al IMHO.Controls freeze up and become unresponsive quite often.

My last 2 hours of play were idling for the rest of the cards. Basically it's an easy 100% (all the achievements unlock just from story progress) with cards. Grab it on a big sale or in a bundle."

Ehhh...The game took me a little under two hours to complete. The puzzles were incredibly easy, and the game flow was super simple. The story was atrocious, and the graphics were down right awful. The mechanics were very limited - most of the game was finding keyhole-like items and putting them in their place.If you're looking for a video game with the entertainment value of having a tv show on in the background, I highly recommend this game. If you'd rather spend your time playing something better, I would steer as far away from this atrocity as possible."

However, even if the bugs were fixed entirely, you'd still be left with a puzzle-solving game whose puzzles are off-puttingly simplistic. The mere lack of challenge is one thing, the puzzle design itself being weirdly uninspired for such a visually creative game is another. Most of the time you simply search for specific shapes to then put them into their respective holes in order to open doors. The overwhelming majority of puzzles are exactly this and nothing more. I mean, to be perfectly clear here, I don't need my casual games to be brain-bustingly difficult, that's not my point, but the puzzles in this game are easyanduninteresting, and that's just a tiresome combination."

I do think it's a bit silly that it's even tagged under horror (the only real reason I bought this game). It has a feel of a HOG, although there are obsolutely no hidden object scenes. The story is decent for this type of game. It's about the length I'd assume for this kind of game, as well.A plus is that there aren't many games like this that HAVE achievements. If you're an achievement  hunter, this is a pretty easy game to get them. The downside is that there was a lot of little quirks that need fixing or changing to make this game better. For instance, in one part near the end, the game had be collect a piece of the amulet I had already collected. When you click on a zoomed area, you HAVE to click on the back button to exit. It'd be nice to be able to just click outside of the box to exit it. I love map options, as well, since it saves a bit of time when going back to previously explored areas. This game has no map option (call me lazy, but this annoyed me). There were also times when I tried using the correct item on something and it wouldn't take the action. I had to do it a couple times for it to even register the action.Overall, if you can get this game cheap, I'd grab it. Don't expect it to be the greatest, but it's still pretty decent. Definitely NOT a horror game, if you're specifically looking for one."

Acceptable short casual point and click adventure with some very simple puzzles.On the plus side, it has nice graphics and good animation. There is a map feature for easy navigation.On the down side, it has a so so and cheesy plot, started out quite nice, but there's no real twist. I was expecting the other ghosts are actually evil and misleading, or the main char's task suddenly turns sour, or something very unexpected to happen. But no... it has to be straightforward and somewhat forced. I caught myself rolling eyes many times.This game assumes that the player is quite familiar with this genre. There is no offer for a tutorial at the start. There are barely any comments when clicking on objects, so player has to guess what to use with it. Most objects are easy to figure out and often available within the scene, otherwise having to use the clue or trial-and-error. The worst of all, there is no description of the puzzles at all. Surely, they are easy for people who already know them, but if this is their first of this genre, it will be frustrating.Actually, I'm in the middle for this game.

It's not bad, some of the animation is pretty, and it kept me occupied for nearly 2 hours, so it's not like it's awful. It's also not quite as laughably bad as Dracula:Legacy which is a very similar game.But...the animation of the mouths is annoying as they flap like fish with no real timing of what they're saying. The story is derivative, and the voice acting of the protagonist is a little limp. The puzzles are not particularly challenging - the main challenge comes from whether you've spotted there's a particular area you haven't reached yet and now you've got the item to reach. There are also very few hints about what object you're meant to combine with what. That wouldn't be a problem if there was a clearer icon e.g. whirling cog, to show that there was somewhere you hadn't yet performed an action. Sometimes there are also areas where you've cleared out all that there is and they still haven't gone.Like others I also found the moving back arrow sometimes didn't work and that the inventory disappeared at random intervals.So...on the whole it was interesting enough for me to spend a couple of hours, but I won't really find it memorable, nor do I particularly want to play it again."

,Not Recommended,431260,30247836,Posted: 28 February,all,Sheep!,"WhatCurseddoes, it does reasonably well.  I just don't think it does enough.Cursedlooks and plays like a hidden-object game, with all of the actual HO scenes removed.  It has the usual melodramatic story with all the favourite elements of HOG storylines (female protagonist faces supernatural evil, rescues loved one, redeems villain.) In exchange for the lost HO games, even more running about of various plot coupons is involved.  Most of the gameplay, really, revolves around trying to remember where you saw some kind of lock, now that you've found the object that serves as the key.Graphics and sound are decent, though nothing extraordinary. The puzzles typical of an HO game are here, too.  They're not very hard, but they're done well enough.  In fact, I might grudgingly recommend this game for people who love the flavour of HO games, but hate actually hunting hidden objects, if it weren't for one problem; the game is glitchy.  The discussion forum has plenty of threads from people who encountered game-breaking glitches.  For my own part, I got a glitch-free run up to the final cutscene, where the game crashed completely.  Thereafter, I could never play it again, because it would crash immediately upon loading -- even after an uninstall/reinstall.The combination of the limited gameplay and the game's apparent determination to commit suicide seals my verdict on this one;  look elsewhere for your next HO gaming fix."
