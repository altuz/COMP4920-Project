Given that its only EA at this point in time, there will be more to come. I got the game on sale which is going on right now for a little less than half the original price and I am liking it. It does not feel as mature as Creativerse, but what it has already got the better of my curiosity.What I liked about it.- Its premise is based on fantasy and magic. (This was the main thing for me. I was looking around for a minecraft like game with better graphics and based on magic. BINGO!!)- It has a unique way of crafting in the game, through assembling blocks into shapes then casting a spell on it.- There are some very powerful functional controls given to players where creative mode crafting is involved. You can even make your own customized weapons, and other items. (I have not explored this area much yet, but from watching the available video I thought it was really facinating.)- You can make your own golems of various shapes and sizes by assembling the blocks into a recognizable shape and casting the spell (I doubt there is another game out there that lets you do this). And, you can command said Golem to mine for you.- Lots of blocks, colored blocks, materials, to allow you to get creative with your creations.- You can fly, throw fireballs, and shoot lightning.- Graphics definitely looked better than the pixilated stuff you see in minecraft and its clone.- The ingame map where you actually see all the activity going on in an area around you, including where the mobs are, what they are doing, where are the resources for you to go mining for, and where are the guarded chests-o-loot which you could go killing for.What I didn't like (it is my greatest hope that they exist now because its in EA)- Even though the graphics are better that minecraft, it could still be better.- There are some annoying bugs but not totally game breaking at this point.- Not much of a tutorial going on at this time.- Not a whole of lot content in terms of fun and interesting encounters.- The mob AI could be drastically improved on.- No caves and dungeons to explore (""Yet"", I hope)."
,Recommended,431450,29949024,Posted: 15 February,all,Piratep00f,"Alchemist's Awakening is quite different from most other crafting games. The genius of the game is that everything in the world is divided into a number of elements. If you want to build something out of planks (nature), you can go ahead and gather grass (nature) and then make planks out of your nature element. There's no more need to travel endlessly to find the things you need. Even better still is that you can give life to your creations. A first of its kind, where crafting is combined with actual moving objects! This is something that has been lacking in many crafting other games. Even though the game still has several bugs at the moment of writing this, I find it a very enjoyable game and have high hopes for the development. Worth the €8,- I spend on it!"

The development team is a one man show but he seems to be very responsive to ideas.  Like all early access games there are bugs and stumbling stones.  As long as the developer keeps up the good work I will continue to keep it in my favorites list to see what comes next.

The methodical nature of crafting and building is both calming and relaxing after work. But by far the best element (pun intended) of this game is the lighting, and how sunrise coats the landscape with brilliance and the hope of a new day. A beautifully unique experience I would suggest to fans of typical rust-like games and magic fanatics."

If you're a builder you can build anything you can imagine.Layout lines of blocks at a time or simply click two corners to build walls.You can make custom objects in the object editor then scale them downto be the correct size instead of oversized blocks.  I've made a garden trellisa popcorn popper  trucks and trailers all scaled down to fit right in.Literally anything you can imagine. Play in creative mode,singleplayeror on the multiplayer server.

76561198053422627,Recommended,431450,21969335,"Posted: 21 March, 2016",all,Zaxtor99 ® YouTube,"Here is my First moments in the game right after it launched in early access here on Steam:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn82cspwepcThe 2nd time I played (also on launch day in early access), I livestreamed the game and even had one of the developers in my livestream chat.. Here is that video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEGtcXxbH2UThe game is a little rough right now in it's current state, but I believe has plenty to provide a lot of fun with some new twists on the current popularity of these open sandbox survival and crafting sort of games.  Still, I love that it feels fresh and like the developers are actually trying to create something fun and innovative with this game as opposed to all of these sort of games where it feels like just a scam or cash grab attempt.This game is VERY playable and a LOT better then I expected going into it having not seen any other reviews or gameplay footage.  I love how you can combine and collect items to make elements. For example, you can easily collect wood from a tree, and make a windmill following the simple design, use your tool you start with to bring it to life.  At that point, it will collect the element ""wind"" over time and you simply need to right click your windmill at any time to collect the stored wind.  You can make an over with a block of 8 stone blocks and the same tool, then put wood into the over to create the element ""fire"".  After you have both wind and fire, it's very easy to combine them to create fireballs which you can use as a weapon against the plentiful wolves and ninja beasts that love to aggro you when you walk too close to them.  Use can also just use fire by itself to shoot out a flame like a blow torch as a weapon as well, but it's not as much fun as casting fireballs which explode for more damage.  Also you can use wind to fly around the world, but make sure you have plenty before to take off too far, because if you run our of wind power while flying high, you will fall to the earth and take fall damage.If you die, you lose all your stuff on your corpse and it seems to vanish pretty quickly at the current time.  But never fear, using wood blocks in a 3 x 2 x 2 pattern and the tool will create a chest to keep all your un-needed resources safe, much like a bank box.Collect all of the elements, and you can give life to ANY creature that you decide to make out of materials.  Want a solid gold golem, no problem!  Just find enough gold metal and then all the elements to bring him to life!  Want a gigantic iron spider with 8 legs?  I haven't yet tried that yet, but it seems like it would work, and I love this about the game!  ..Super cool!I think that this game will really appeal to players who love minecraft in particular, but also to anyone who enjoys sandbox, creative kind of games.As this game goes through development and early access, it will be intersting to see how to gets molded by the developers with feedback and suggestions from the early access players.  Will hunger be added?  What about the ability to create more items such as bombs, moving devices, etc?  I honestly think it's well worth the price tag to be a part of this game and both watch and play it as it develops.  This IS a special game, and it's nice to see these early access games like this made by developers who actually desire to make a ""fun"" game as the priority over trying to make a quick buck.  That is already obvious to me on day one of it's early access.  Enough said.It's not perfect yet, but it IS fun!  It also already seems to have a heart and soul, and bringing your creations to life is very rewarding!  Add in the ability to play online with friends and you got a game well worth it's asking price.My Score on Day #1 of early access...VALUE:  At $16 USD, regular retail price today, I believe this game offers a nice value for your money.. with procedurally generated worlds and the ability to play online, this game delivers in the value department already.  38 out of 40 for Value is my score here.FUN:  It's a very fun game, at least my first few hours, and theres so much left to do, I don't see that changing much, especially as more and more content gets added over time!  I give this game an impressive 27 out of 30 score here.CONTROLS and BUGS:  The controls are fluid and responsive, there are a few weird glitches and bugs but nothing game breaking or un-expected of a game in early access.  I give this part of my scoring a 16 out of 20 for this game.GRAPHICS & SOUND:  The graphics and sound deliver well enough to make playing the game enjoyable but not anything that will take your breath away.  Everything looks as it should, and the music and sound works with nothing either disappointing to me or mind blowing.  7 out of 10 is my score in this department.ADD IT ALL UP.. AND I GIVE THIS GAME A SOLID 88%.  That's a damn nice score for a game like this on launch day of early access.!!! IMPORTANT - BEFORE YOU BUY !!!-----------------------------Please check the recommended specs before you buy this.  If you have less then 8 GB of RAM, if your CPU is older then 3 years old, and/or your video card isn't a GeForce 650ti or better, you are very likely to notice laggy gameplay and slower then ideal framerates.  Please make sure your computer can handle this game before buying it.. this game requires a much beefier system then Minecraft or World of Warcraft does for example.-----------------------------Impressive stuff devs, keep up the good work, and thanks for deliverying an enjoyable game in early access, something that isn't exactly common on Steam these days with early access games."

It's still in Early Access (EA), but it is one of the better EA games I have played!  It isn't nearly finished, but it is already fun to play!The world that was generated for my first experience is beautifully rendered is high quality graphics.  I set the anti-aliasing from 1x to 2x (your only two choices) and it slowed the game down a bit.  It wasn't that much better, as the graphics already looked awesome!Sound is good without any pops or glitches.  There was a storm brewing and it sounded awesome!  Creature sounds were great and scary at times.  I was being persued by a beastie and thankfully I found a building to hide in! I let my pet do the fighting while I ran away! lol  He died, but he showed up later when I was building stuff, so I guess he respawned?It looks like a good deal of work has been put into this game already and it has some really great working ideas!  It still needs work, but it is playable and I never felt I couldn't advance in the game due to an unfinished part.  The map generated for me is HUGE!  It will take some time exploring this map! You can enter you own seeds for map generation.There are beasties to fight, if you can figure out how to build a weapon! lol  I'm not that far into the game yet. If you die you just respawn, so it's not that punishing.  You'll build things like windmills and lightning rods to capture and harvest resources.  It's pretty cool!As I said, there are some really great ideas here and many of them are already working and playable.  KUDOS to the dev's as this is looking to be an awesome game!  Please don't stop developement on this game as it could be one of the GREAT games here on Steam!!!

Modding your architecture is great i cant wait to see some great structures that you can subscribe, load on your map move anywhere you want and place. yes place it anywhere high, low, rotate it. Mods=skins, giant structures, trees, buildings, and much more. Walk through and check out there constructions modify the building you download, make towns, invite friends to your towns, cities, terrofom land, change material of land make your own trees. Make Pixal Art. Make a mod of your design and publish it and see if your structure can be the most popular in Alchemists Awakening. The game Alchemists Awakening by Osaris is Early Access and being updated and modified. They are really helpful, polite and work prompt on feedback and bugs.

,Recommended,431450,21982759,"Posted: 22 March, 2016",all,Ceronos,"My first 30 min with the game:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOofggWK6J0TLDR:It's a really neat building game, rough around the edges but some of the core mechanics are incredible at this stage of development. The ability to fly and bring creatures to life are two of the most promising features out the early access box. The game runs fairly well on a moderate system as well.The Good:Alchemist's Awakening captured my interest the first instant I saw it under Upcoming games. I checked it out, looked at the screenshots, read the description and thoughts: Okay here we go again, more promise than worth. I ended up getting it day one, and the above link is my first time playing. Needless to say, I end up having allot of fun. It's not that the game is amazing; the feeling I get from this is more of awe. Rediscovering how to build in a familiar setting felt quick but unknown enough to make it entertaining. Spending more time with the game after making my video, I learned about the flying/life creation/biomes.I feel like I could see multiplayer being played very diversely. It can be a PvP fest, or just a community thing. Arena based golem fighting?The soundtrack is stunning, and was instantly impressive.The life creation process is fun, and is without a doubt one of the big activities to do. You can make massive creatures, but more often than not, you will probably make some sort of abomination.Cons:Some things are clearly implemented that really shine the early access polish. The combat being one of my yellow flags. It's not terrible, just very much a placeholder until it's improved upoin.On the theme of combat, after looting several chests found with the enemies, I had about 8 fire or ice swords.It seems that you face two enemies, wolves and bandits. Like I said, combat seems to be recently added, and not fleshed out. Nothing wrong with that though.Not all sound effects are as pretty as the music.AI is still a funny thing to watch, but is being improved on._______I'll be sure to update and add more as development continues!"
,Recommended,431450,21988184,"Posted: 22 March, 2016",all,emp456,"Alchemist's Awakening is a polished and beautiful early access game that worths it's actual content for it's price.I am testing with graphics at maximum and not only the game looks beautiful, but it also runs at 60 fps without any lag.Building is somewhat similar to minecraft but with a very personal touch: you are an alchemist, so you collect natural elements and materials from the world without needing a tool and you can create different shapes and blocks with these materials. There is no recipe list because you need to create a form with blocks and materials and then apply some weird spell to see if that shape can create something useful.For example, creating a rectangular form with 6 blocks at the floor let's you make a chest. If you try to form that shape vertical, it creates another thing (or not, but those are different shapes and make different 'recipes') Another example is creating a vertical rectangular form of 8 blocks, and that makes a door (spoiler, spoiler :P)You can also give life to your creations using a combination of all elements and materials in the world (there are 9 elements/materials to use) This is probably what makes this game different from others open-survival-crafting games. Creating a tall wood protector or a stone golem is possible here, and you can of course try different combinations and make your friend a mix of stone, fire and crystal, if you want.The weak point of this, and where it shows that it's still in development is the combat. For now, there are 2 types of enemies: wolfs and dark tall warriors with a big sword. While you can use the elements to create spells (like a fireball, for example or a lightning), the melee combat needs a lot of work. And also, the animations. For now it works and you can also kill a wolf with a sword, but it feels very basic.I hope they will also work a little more the AI of enemies and your 'friends', because right now they seem to like to get stuck usually with just a few rocks and you need to go back to 'help' them gathering those rocks.Another point is that, right now, 'survival' just means avoid being killed by one of those wolfs or warriors. There is no hunger, or thirst.Given another. mmm... not very good examples of early access that are also survival, open world and which also have crafting, this one looks, plays and feels like a very solid base for adding more content and features.Oh, and i haven't found any bugs until now.Actual content and gameplay: enough to start a new world and to play at least for a few hours collecting all materials, creating a house and needed tools/machines (oven, windmill,m lighting rod for auto-collecting elements) and a few golem friends to crush all in your way.Not going to talk about potential because i don't know and i don't like. For now, this is a solid game that, of course, is in development and needs more love, but it's already better than a lot others and in some cases, it's even cheaper so i think it worths the 15 dollars/euros or whatever right now.And as a picture is worth a thousand words, here's my house with my friends Patata and Willy xD:[img]http://prnt.sc/aimall[/img]P.S: if someone knows how to show the image instead of the link, please feel free to leave me a message in comments :P"

No starting weapon, just lion and got in 1min attacked by 2 wolves. No tuttorial on how to build stuff.Ugh, good thing steam's support is more trustwhorthy than the comments on here."

However you can only play in window mode by hitting f11 at the title. its laggy as all heck. i have a high end pc. now i have to wait for the refund and ignore all the hope i had to play this amazing idea of a game.

Doesnt seem to be anything to do.. no quests...no instructions on how to get started when you log in everything attacks you die and drop anything you might be lucky enough to have. Didnt seem to be a way to harvest stuff. SUCK SUCKS SUCKS

I love the subject matter and the game play is coming along nicely. There are some issues here and there but remember this is an early release title, and the developers have been quick to turn around fixes and additions."

,Recommended,431450,22281189,"Posted: 7 April, 2016",all,Armitage,"DISCLAIMER: I only recommend this game because to not recommend it would do it a diservice due to the dev's transparency with what's available in the game.I would consider this a tech demo right now. The store page doesn't tell you anything more than it needs to. It's an hoest overview of what;s available to you right now in game.As far as the game itself goes, it uses a very unique slant on crafting, and given time and subject to the dedication of the devs, this game could be a real winner.Purchase with care, this is very early alpha, but what's in the game seems to work fairly well, with the exception of combat. The combat system needs a ton of work. If you're loooking for a feature complete game, wait for this game to be out of early access.Pros:- Large open world map.- Unique crafting system.- Lots of potential.- Some amazing mechanics, like the flight and give life spellsCons:- Not a great looking game (but the gameplay could easily make up for that).- Combat system is clunky- Tutorial is a little light on information- Only 2 enemies- Limited tools and crafted blocks- AI is fairly derpy"

It looks good, there's a handful of interesting environments, and the magic is amazing.  Sure, it's simple right now, the enemy variety is limited, there isn't anything like a story (at the moment), but there is something about deciding to animate a whole, giant tree to follow you around and fight with you is an amazing moment."

At the current stage now, theres really no objective to do (They said they're developing a singleplayer story mode) but explore at your own will, so I say either buy it now or wait until its finished, but by then the price will hike up."
