The cars included with Automobilista are top-notch, especially the assortment of F1 ""style"" cars from every major era of Formula 1. The included track list is lacking, but head over to Race Department and you'll find a wide assortment of high quality mods (Especially CART Extreme). The niche audience of this game has kept third part content at a high standard. The newly included Championship Creator is a long overdue addition that has added it to my sim racing schedule in the next few weeks, as well as the new Formula Ultimate car (2017 F1 ""Style"" Car).If you're getting into sim racing, this is one of my five ""must-have"" titles (the others being: iRacing, Assetto Corsa, rFactor 2, RaceRoom) and I would rate it third overall with a first place in physics/car handling and a second place in AI (after rF2)."

It looks better than Stock Car Extreme and sounds better too, although some sounds (touring cars) and visuals (mostly interior models) need improvment and there are some graphical bugs here and there that existed in Stock Car Extreme as well. I have to say that so far I'm pretty stoked with this sim and I will be putting hundreds of hours in to this before long.Physics - 9.5Graphics - 7.1Sounds - 7.8Content - 9.0Can't wait to see what elese is coming from Reiza!"

This game is Reiza taking the ISI Motor and really turning it into something of their own.  All of the content is solid, and the stadium trucks and rallycross Lancer are Reiza showing they can nail any type of car.  I can't wait to see what else come to this game and the future Reiza project."

I think much of that comes from the amazingly communicative force feedback which seems to have no lag whatsover. You really feel connected to the car and can really get in the ""zone"". The level of immersion is fantastic as far as i'm concerned.If you rate a decent game engine and realism above everything else I would definitely recommend this over the other titles at the moment (although I also rate rF2). I think perhaps Reiza really understand the importance of input repsonse and feedback.Many thanks Reiza for persevering with simulation and not selling out."

,Recommended,431600,34314742,Posted: 17 August,all,Bradlero,"This game..... THIS GAME!Where to begin.... I've mentioned this before in my reviews about racing games/sims, I'll say it again, I primarily play racing and sim type games on PC and console, if there's been a racing game released on either in the last 30 years I've likely played it. In regards to sims; Assetto Corsa, Project Cars, rFactor 2, R3E.... you name it, I own them all, and play them all. Automobilista has to be my favorite out of all of them!Here's why;Automobilista is a fantastic racing sim. Reiza has taken rFactor 1 and built on that to the point that it feels like a new experience. Essentially what we have here is rFactor 1 with all the best mods included and updated, plus many little tweaks here and there to bring one of the best racing experiences available on the PC at this time.Sure the graphics may not be on par with something like AC or PCars, but this is a DX9 title and for that era of game engine, the visuals certainly do more then enough to appear convincing and many of the car models included as well as available via modding are faithfully reproduced inside and out. The full daytime spectrum is available when racing from dawn till dusk and overnight, unfortunately weather is currently not an option but I dont find I miss that too much since the simulation is so engrossing in other ways.By default the game ships with some of the most diverse racing series available in a game and this is great as it allows you to dip your toes into something you may not have otherwise tried. From stock cars, to Porsche GT3 cars, to nearly EVERY era of Formula 1 cars and Trophy Trucks to Karts, this game has it all. Oh yeah.... The Formula cars.... Automobilista has a car from nearly every era of Formula one, and this is awesome! Im a big F1 fan, so its really cool to be able to drive all the diff car styles throughout the history of the sport when you please. As far as track content goes the included list is lacking.... it's mostly made up of random Brazilian tracks that no one really knows or cares to know.... There are a few highlights thou, particularly both old and current configurations of Hockenheim and Imola (both of which I love), It's super cool to take a modern car down the original 72 layout of Imola!! I also love the addition of the Montreal GP circuit from Canada (I'm a Canadian eh!) so i can relate to that track IRL.Reiza has also released some great DLC in the form of new locations, all of which are faithfully recreated.The physics are some of the best in a sim game, even with all the other aforementioned heavy hitting sim titles I still find myself coming back to this game time and time again.... It's just the most fun, and I find the driving model to be spot on with most of the vehicles both included and mods. The FFB is great and the AI is really really smart, probably the best of all sims I've seen yet.Then there's the mods.... This game, like AC and many others available is made exceptional through the mods. In particular there is a track pack with 24 additional circuits by a guy named Patrick you can find on The RaceDept website that is so good its basically considered an official part of the game. It has a lot of the tracks you'd expect to see in a sim such as Monza, Spa, Laguna Seca, Nurburgring, Road America, Road Atlanta, etc. They are all made to the same level of quality as the provided Reiza circuits as well. Simply a must have. Then theres the available cars and series addons..... GTS, WTCC, Formula 1 (skins), CART, it goes on and on. Not the largest mod pool available yet but its growing and the quality of many of them are really really good.BOTTOM LINE; If you love sim racing, do yourself a favor and grab this game! It is hands down one of the best. If you can, try and grab the DLC as well in a bundle, it goes on sale at times.11/10 would buy again."

And a little extra to get it with the Season Pass.My god - set it to harcore sim settings and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ I get right into the Formula V10 and was immedietly shocked at how great the car felt, not even two hours in and it most certainly makes  great use of the ISI (RFactor) engine -  better than even RFactor itself, feels way more real than the old GTR/WTCC series, and  physics are totally Superior to SimRaceWay (another ISI engine project). The FFB is amazing, the sounds are great (mostly, some cars sound weird), and damn I never knew brazil had such amazing race tracks.And the best thing ever - THERE ARE FREAKING SUPER TRUCKS IN HERE. HOLY HELL - they are insane to drive with all assists turned off - and super challenging to keep under control when you come off the ramps - totally nuts to control on the gas during a corner exit - but insanely fun!I wanted a pure hardcore sim - and damn, this title does it well, even if the graphics are a bit dated, graphics mean nothing if the game itself is fun. So many new tracks to learn, plenty of content - finally a racing sim that has me super excited - I hope I get plenty of free time to learn all these unfamiliar tracks, just the two I have tried were astoundingly interesting. Obviously brazil loves to throw chicanes right after full-throttle-open sectors of track, I predict many flat spots to appear on my tyres in the weeks to come.Certainly the best use of the ISI engine I have ever tried (in my opinion of course).Was also super easy and quick to get my DFGT wheel setup with this.I have been looking for a super fun (and super hardcore) racing sim since my old LFS and NR2003 days, and 2016 has been a horrible drag:- Assetto Corsa, great, but the addiction is starting to fade.- Tried F12016,  refunded - silly simcade physics and weird car handling.- Tried Nascar Heat Evolution, refunded - totally an arcade racer with a so called ""sim mode"" but does not have any form of realistic and believable handling  - nore do the cars actually stear more than100 degrees either direction (also, non linear steering appears to be build specifically with console players and gamepads in mind). Also - crap physics.- Rfactor2. Really pretty - really cool tyre model, plenty of content - but somehow is lacking in something special that I cant put my finger on.- Project Cars: <-- I wont touch this with a 10 ft pole.- Automobolista: Where the ♥♥♥♥ is the advertising for this sim, I should have discovered this ages ago, it's certainly a gem."

One of the best choices i ever made, since then i am hooked. Started with Project Cars and it felt ""real"". I loved how all of a sudden i got some sort of rollercoaster in my own house. Amazing. Soon after i added F1 2016 to my collection. Also awesome. Also felt ""real"".I had no idea.Then i bought Automobilista. At first i didn't like it. The menu's and all around presentation seem to be from a previous era, same goes for the graphics. Also basically every car i drover got in a spin as soon as i tries to take a fast or technical corner. I was used to the more arcade approach of PC and F12016 and went back to those games. I guess just to comfort myself and to have an easy drive.Put after a while i came back to Automobilista. I knew i had to give it another chance. I started riding simple ovals in all kinds of cars and started to geta feeling for them. And that feeling grew. It only took a couple of hours before i understood how to drive a ""real"" car. And it was amazing.Now just 36 hours in and i am hooked. This game let's you set up basically every race on every track available. Most tracks are unknown tracks from Brazil, but their detail is top notch. The force feedback is just from another planet. You feel every bump, every line. It is simply amazing.Autmobilista is one of the best if not the best simulators on the market imo. Also tried iracing and Asetto Corsa, but Automobilista is the game i'll use to get beter at sim racing. Having an absolute blast.Would buy again. Masterpiece."
,Recommended,431600,32580705,Posted: 19 June,all,acdcdave1387,"This is the single greatest exhibition of the original rFactor engine. The team at Reiza really outdid themselves here.The car selection is awesome. For fans of Formula 1 you have a car from almost every era. Open wheel fans in general can rejoice knowing that there is pretty much something from every level of professional racing. The other various types of vehicles provide a level of diversity that few other games have. The Brazilian stock cars are actually really cool, especially if you like touring cars.The track selection isn't the greatest. There is a large quantity of tracks and they are of high quality but the majority of them are smaller unknown Brazilian tracks. With that being said, most of them are really fun tracks though and there are always a LOT of different variations to each and every track.The audio, despite being this dated rFactor 1 engine, is well done. The engine recordings are spot on and the feel of the cars is terrific.The game is definitely one of the top sims out there. If you are a fan of proper sim racing then this is a title you must NOT pass up. If you are new to sim racing then this will still be a great title because you can always lower the realism and work your way up.The AI is fantastic by the way. Do yourself a favor and give this one a try folks."

The graphics are a bit dated, yes but with some Nvidia Inspector and a couple mods, you're right where you need to be.This isn't a simcade game. It's an actual simulation. Be ready for that if you want to buy it.I don't know what type of wheel people have that are complaining about FFB, but my Fanatec CSL Elite and F1 wheel feel amazing in this game. The V10 F1 series is a bit loose in regards to steering, but that can be compenstated for on my wheel. Everything else feels like the real thing.The people complaining about this sim/game haven't played a real racing sim before. Comparing this to F1 20XX, Project Cars or Assetto Corsa isn't doing it justice. This is a real simulation for people who enjoy real racing. If you don't want that then go back to an arcade that has hard drivin' or Chase HQ.This is the best racing SIM available currently. If you complain about it, buy a PS4."

The physics leave little to be desired, the AI is fantastic, and the force feedback is the second best I have tried. Niels is a genius.. I play almost every sim on the market, but I was late to the party with this one, and i gotta say, I was missing a lot. The Reiza content is fantastic, and it also has a great mod community, with the best mods from RFactor available (only updated and upgraded), and original mod content as well. The physics and force feedback aren't quite at RFactor 2's level, but the content is possibly superior in range of vehicles you get. Nothing matches the best cars in RF2, but it also doesn't have any below average content, and every single car is worthy of your time. That said, after discovering RFACTOR 2, I have been spending a lot less time here. My only complaint is that the online community is lacking, but the fault lies on us consumers and not the game itself. If you haven't tried it yet, do it. Do IT! As soon as possible, do it! If you are into sim racing, I would say this is a must have title. Forget the other big names coming out right now, as they may be prettier, but none of them will give you the complete package and amazing wheel to wheel racing experience that this does. They fixed the UI issues since GSCE and now the whole thing looks a lot more polished, with new colours, design, and on HUD while racing. And I haven't even mentioned the fact that Reiza is always updating, and releasing FREE new content to people who own it. There isn't a better value for your money out there. See you on the track!"
,Recommended,431600,31821599,Posted: 18 May,all,TobimanDBoss,"AMS has been a solid experience for me so far. SO much excitement wrapped in a little package and is worth a place in every sim racers library. The astonishing array of fomula cars, racing trucks and unique cars makes this a germ that you can't find anywhere else. The handling of the cars and ffb are unique yet very outstanding. I find it to be just as good as assetto corsa, in that regard, when you warm up to it.Some of the cars feel really alive but a lot of the feedback coming from the wheel is usually noise and can tend to mask what the car is actually doing. This is unique to just a few cars and isn't really a con.If I had one problem, it would be the graphics quality for 2017. I can't complain though since this game serves a niche market of sim racers and is incredibly easy to run. Every sim racer needs to buy it but reiza is too small to do any sort of advertisement like project cars/R3E can pull off which is a bit sad. I wish more people could enjoy this fun interpretation of sim racing which would aid reiza in developing a more polished experience overall in the future. 10/10."

It may look oldschool but for a proper driving simulator it's actually really fun. Physics and force feedback are up there with the best in class... but there are plenty of sims that can say that. This one beats them by providing the full package out of the box - the stuff you actually enjoy in driving games, and lots of it. This is particularly the case if you miss a quality single player experience. (There's MP too but I haven't tried that.)It has a fantastic comprehensive library of cars (including some unique classes) and tons of tracks and variations, which all feel very different. Every class has a full championship available, some several. Racing against AI is actually pretty good, with convincing 3 wide stock car action, an ai spotter on the radio, and real safety cars and flag rules. Glorified lawn mower 1 gear rental carts feel like rental carts, 70s muscle cars feel like they should, modern stock cars (particularly the aussie and brasilian formats) are especially satisfying. The insane open wheel and dirt cars, even trucks! are all convincing. This is also the only sim I have played where they sixties formula 1 cars drive like a modern evolution of the punishing GPL engine. As for F1, no licenses, but you can drive representatives of major format from the sixties onwards on historically matched track variants. Awesome. :)I'm kicking myself for having bought it a few days ago for full price, but after putting a few hours in I can see it's worth every penny. If you are an even occasional sim racer you'd be nuts to pass this up during the sale given the value here. I can see the thirty or so championship seasons on offer being my go-to offline racing kick for some time. :)"

The Sweetfx look  nice and natural and the sound engine of the game has been nicely upgraded,   Everything sounds much less computery (compared to GSCE) and more natural.  Both really welcome upgrades.  (Yes, you can get Sweetfx for GSCE and rfactor, but you can't upgrade the ancient sound engine like Rieza has done here.)The FFB for me ( DFGT user here ) is much much better in ways, although isn't as strong as GSCE ( 100% in AMS is not the same 100% in GSCE). But it FEELS better imho.  Its almost..ALMOST rfactor2 levels, for me at least. Nice details in all the bumps and colisions, and again, it FEELS more natural, hehe..So buy it! If you love racing."

I love sim racing games and if you check my library I own allot of them.  If you are looking at reviews deciding between games like Pcars, Assetto Corsa, and Automobilista they all have something to offer so get them all.  My main arguments for this game is the AI is really good,  one example is the driver spun out recovered and fault like hell to prevent from being lapped.  I can honestly say  I never experienced anything like that.  Physics and FFB are superior as well.  Graphics are a little dated but just like when im playing GTR2 or Race07 I dont care, its all about the driving experience."

The tracks are mostly South American, so apart from Interlagos you might find yourself a little lost if you are used to Spa and Nüburgring. For some this is a huge plus, since it means that you get to try new tracks. Some people really don't like it, since they went to drive on the same maps they are used to.Another major complaint from people are the graphics. Since the game is still based on the rfactor engine, the graphics are of course not the prettiest. Personally, it doesn't really bother me, since the ffb and the physics are more important than the graphics."

I almost felt like i was buying in to the sim racing past rather than the future. Eventually however it was in the sale at a good price and happily I am not disappointed. The content is interesting and varied and the driving experience convincing.I feared it may just be a mix on the Rfactor theme, which it is to an extent, but the extra features such as the dynamic track and updated FFB make it worthwhile. The graphics are not as ancient as some may have you believe - sure its no Assetto Corsa but they are good enough and run very smoothly with everything cranked up to maximum.More importantly the driving experience makes a lot of sense and it is actually fun to play. I feel all the current sims have their strengths, I already own R3E, RF2, iracing and Assetto Corsa. AMS compares favourably to them all and in some respects has exceeded my expectations. Considering the amount you can spend on other sims which use a subscription and/or paid content business model AMS is certainly good value and a sim that any dedicated sim racer should not be without!"

Yes it uses the rFactor engine, but what has been achieved here far exceeds what any others have managed. If you were to get rFactor, download all the best mods, set up everything perfectly, follow guides etc.. you would not come close to what this game does out the box, without mods.You actually do not need to add mods at all. In most cases you will in fact undue the great work that has gone on here if you do.There are some mod added tracks available that are Automobilista quality, but try to avoid filling up the locations folder...just because you can. Stick with the original content and drive until you can do it well.If you want the best visuals, then buy Project cars, otherwise look no further, unless online racing is all you do, in which case go iRacing.

,Recommended,431600,24035251,"Posted: 2 July, 2016",all,Gunsargeramalls,"VIDEO AVAILABLE ATwww.twitch.tv/ramalls.WOW!  All I can say is ............. WOW!  iRacing, watch out.  This game currently cost 30 bucks with no residual cost (as of this writing).Let's talk racing simulation.1. Car physics.  Automobilista has nailed it!  The different cars have different physics and handling characteristics that you can feel!  Tire wear, suspension travel, brakes, camber.....you make adjustments and you feel the difference.2. Dynamic tracks and tire wear. I swear while I was racing in the F3 car I could see my tires degrading over time............not just feel it but see it.  Now, maybe it's just because you have real time telemetry data that tells you what your tire state is, but I kept looking at my right front tire and I could swear I started seeing tread wear. Anyway, they have their tire model spot on.........and it's only going to get better.  The tires pick up gravel and grass if you run off the road and you can hear it on the pavement also.  Run behind someone that has ran off the road and hear the dirt and gravel ping and pong off your car's underbelly.  Great job.3.  Force Feedback.  THIS RIGHT HERE PEOPLE IS WHAT FORCE FEEDBACK IS ALL ABOUT.  They got it right..........on the first try none the less.  There are a number of default setups for almost every racing wheel you can think of.  G27, G29, MoMo, driving force..........if you have a wheel, it's probably supported here.  (CAUTION:  This is a TRUE racing sim, so please don't attempt to drive with a gamepad.  I see some support is in there, but you really are not going to get the full experience).4.  Graphics.  This is where some pundants say that Automobilista is failing.  I say that they are a small team of developers with a small budget that have created a simulation that is DIRECTLY  challenging Assetto Corsa, iRacing, RFactor, etc.  If I was to put the graphics to a scale of 1-10, I'd give them a solid 7.............but remember, this is an Early Access of the game.  How may of you remember Assetto Corsa's early access. Pretty damn strong graphics........horrible physics.  Automobilista is headed in the right direction.5.  AI.  I know, I know...........who wants AI in a simulation racer.  Let's be honest, there isn't a racing sim out there that can compete with the online community of iRacing.  You ALWAYS find human racers to compete with.  That's not to say that Automobilista doesn't have a mulitplayer community.  Indeed, you can log on and find some multiplayer races.  However, the community has not expanded yet.  Therefore, you NEED AI to get some traffice time it.  The scaleable AI here is some of the best I've seen in a racing sim yet.  They truly try to find the best path around you for a pass and seem to attempt to avoid all contact.5.  Complaints. As I said earlier, this is an early access of the game.  However, I want to be sure to let everyone know if some of the downsides that I think exists.  First, you will notice some clipping when you collide with certain artifacts in the game.  It's nothing that ruins the overall realism and fun of the sim, however, it's there. Also, there seems to be some scaling issues with a few of the tracks. Montreal's straights seem to be pretty short.  Speaking of tracks, there are curently 0 American Road  Courses in the game.  Hopefully this will change..........(Long Beach, St Petersburg......FORGET Laguna Seca).  There are also a lot of tracks that are either new to me or not real world tracks.  When setting up a single player practice session, you have to manually add the AI cars..............ONE CAR AT A TIME.....CLICK.....CLICK.....CLICK.... Hopefully this will get changed.6.  Speaking of cars............There are several in here that are not mainstream to your typcial racer.  COPA is something complete new to me.............and I love it.  COPA MONTANA are GT trucks that are pretty damn fun to drive.  The other COPA (sorry cannot remember the spelling or name) is GT Hondas Civics and Cheverolets.  Pretty damn fun to run these rice burners.  There are also SUPER V8 TRUCKS and tracks (imaging dirt rally truck on a race track with buitl in jumps).  Definitely a change of pace.  What doesn't exist right now are true GT3/GT1 cars.All in all, I'm really excited to see what Reiza is going to do with this simulation.  They have definitely come out swinging and are directly challenging the mainstream racing simulations on the market today.  This is how you do an early access game here........(hint hint hiht Star Citizen).  Looking forward to more to come.  I'll update this review as new content comes out.See you on the track!!Oh, if you want to see video, check out my twitch page athttp://www.twitch.tv/ramallsEnjoy."

I had the previous game from Reiza Studios, Stock Car Extreme, and this game builds upon that game with more polish and more tracks, cars and the like. It's not a Forza or Project Cars type of game, with fantastic graphics. But the graphics are more than enough to support the racing and it also means it can run well on less than uber hardware.The racing is very good. All the bells and whistles are there for setups. And there are a lot of options for control layouts. I use an X360 controller since I'm more of a causal racer and the game easily supports this. And the large number of different car classes means a player can find a number of different cars that appeal to you. And there is a whole range of assists so whether you are a newbie or a hardcore sim racer you can find the assist options that you prefer.Finally, there is a healthy mod community already in place to support this game. There are already a zillion skins, several new cars and tracks and a bunch of other mods.

The AI make the same mistakes as I do and jostle with each other on the track in such a way that it's almost creepy.  And they're not overly aggressive or ""stupid messy"".  Nobody has coded their AI like this studio.The physics model is amazing.  The only other sim I've found that is somewhat comparable is Assetto Corsa.  It's excellent.  The damage model is good and comparable to most racing sims.  Not crazy good like Dirt Rally, F1 2016 or Grid Autosport, but good.  The OVERALL physics model is not like Nascar Racing Season 2003, but what is?  Although, it's really good.The FFB and control setup is great and very easy to adjust.

That's what I thought...keep your eyes on the road and that AI behind you that's trying to eat your lunch with style.  An example of the detail given in little areas you wouldn't expect to see any is when you drive into grass or dirt, it sticks to your tires for a short period of time.  I've only seen that in F1 2016 and that's ""last week new"".  The cars are beautiful.The content is, well, excellent.  You want Stock Cars? OK got it.  Want F1? OK got that too.  Trucks?

Forza 5 (ok console release title, still♥♥♥♥♥♥ Project Cars failed completely with a broken game that i heard wasn't much better on PC, formula 1 2015, poo. Any way my cousin introduced me to two great racing sims on The PC, iracing and RFactor 2, both fantastic games, also introducing me to the new dirt game which was brilliant.After reading reviews about this game I thought why not, its not expensive, it dosn't need a subscription and its got amazing feedback. So i took the plunge.EARLY ACCESS!!!!!! Best early access I've ever played. It has more content then any console racing game thats been a finished title. The graphics are great, fps is smooth running 120 fps dead, no jutter, just what you want from a racing game. The Sound is fantastic, I've not driven many cars in the 6 hours I've clocked up so far but I have to say the mini cooper race was a blast. My G27 needed no config at all everything was set just perfect. the feedback really sychs with what im seeing on the screen.I have experienced one issue but its not anything major, but is still a problem non the less. If i have my xbox one elite plugged in for use of headset on skype, the game does not boot. Im assuming that its simply just conflicting what controller the game wants to use. The moment i unplug the xbox controller the game loads fine.This game is Just brilliant though. The AI can be adjusted for those that are inexperienced racers or the true vetran racers. The AI is the best I've ever experienced, but still useless when it comes to them getting back on the racing line.I've done three races in three different classes, all with rolling starts, the races have been great, but the auto start is annoying, you seem to lose momentum against the AI Due to the game changing to 3rd gear as you're given control. bring in a warm up lap to begin a rolling start then i would find this game completely perfect. Even without that slight change this game is a gem, and I recommend it to any kind of racer, be it rookie or hardcore this is a superb racing game. Also with a modding community and a lot of events that are set up daily, not taken part in anything myself but i have looked into it and aim to become a competitor in the future but i have some training to do.9.8/10Cons: Minor controller glitch, which stops the game loading, easily fixed by removing xbox device.

The Classic F1 and 86 Opala Chevy I6 Stock Car being my favourite cars to run.The game uses an upgraded Rfactor engine with great physics and more livly graphics and textures. Clearity @High FPS and any resoloution is always awesome. The modeling is pretty great.If you can't play anyone online, then why not just get together with a friend and race the Ai Together, it works for me. This is so much better then all those other games that pass them selves off as simulation, such as Asetto Corsa, and Project DLC. All super cars, no soul.The server system finally works, the Hud is pretty good for such an old game engine, and the controls are solid, just make sure you spend enough time tuning the wheel outside and inside the game and make sure the steering feels just right."

Combined with the force feedback and handling of the cars is the sense of speed delivered in the way you're virtual head moves about inside the cockpit. I set the head motion and yaw exaggeration to the maximum, cranked up ""look ahead"" all the way, and it REALLY adds to the sense of g forces involved in cornering, accelerating and braking inside the cockpit as it feels like the car is violently bucking and surging, as it should in an F1 car.As far as graphics go I was about to delete the game from my system and go on a forum and ♥♥♥♥♥ about how crappy they are until I discovered that you have to DISABLE SweetFX in the initial setup screen of the game, keep Anti Aliasing OFF...and then go into the nvidia control panel and manually setup the Anti Aliasing there to OVERRIDE the game's settings.I bumped my Anti Aliasing up to 32 supersample and now the graphics are smooth as silk. If you just install the game as is with sweetFX enabled the graphics look a bit like playstation 1, so don't delete it from you system until you follow the above.Don't expect Assetto Corsa level graphics here but to me, it's all about the smoothness of the jaggies. The textures of the track are done quite nicely and are very detailed. The cars are modeled very well but there are a few bugs in some views, such as when looking to the rear while in the cockpit your back wheels won't be visible in the F1 car. But this is still pre launch so I'm sure it will get fixed. The terrain in general is a bit bland but on par.The thing I'm finding with the tracks is they are all a little bland just by their nature, but a blast to drive. So again, this sim isn't about showcasing eye candy, its about the EXPERIENCE, and in my opinion this is THE game for F1 hot lapping.I have not yet tried driving against the Ai so I can't speak about that, but my hunch is it will be intense. I've never had a game pull me so much into the feeling of driving an F1 car at high speed as this one. Just be sure to widen your field of view a bit back to get that sense of speed necessary.If you crave a pure F1 experience THIS is THE game."
,Recommended,431600,27907314,"Posted: 27 November, 2016",all,BRAAP♛,"Automobilista is the result of Game Stock Car Extreme and rFactor having a baby.Physics:Automobilista has very realistic physics that resembles rFactor and iRacing. Although the force feedback is a bit rough, it is overshined by Automobilista's F1 and Racecar physics. In my opinion, AMS' best physics are in the karts and single-seaters. Automobilista has a different feel than other racing titles which means you will have to get used to it.Gameplay:The best part of automoblista's gameplay would be the online and hotlap modes, where the optimization and hard work is mostly spent. The AI in this game sadly is very poor and imo needs some work. For example if you are slower they will stay behind you until you fully get off the racing line and litterally get out of their sight before making a move, Which means having multiple car classes at once can be a probem in singleplayer.Graphics:The fun part of having an outdated graphics engine is that there is no lag. For people like me who have a poor system this can be a life-saver. Even if the engine is old, the game is suprsingly very nice looking on ultra and is about equivalent to the counter-parts iRacing and the rFactor series. If you are a real sim racer, graphics should not change the way you drive or see a game.Content:Sadly, the game crashes at this aspect. For the price, Automobilista should have double the variety of racing cars and most importantly, TRACKS. Although there are more than 12 tracks in-game, about half of them are mexican/brazilian tracks that the average sim-racer doesnt even know. Racing on Monza, Nurburgring, Spa or Paul Richard  is only acomplished with Mods.Even sader, the upcomming content will all be sold in DLC packs which are way over-priced imo.Overall:physics: 9/10Gameplay: 8/10Graphics: 7/10Content: 6/10Final Rate:     75%"

They have significantly improved in nearly all areas over GSCE. This runs at 4k with unlimited cars on track on max and looks great if you cans upport this. Yeah it would be nice to have a few more known tracks but if you mod your games and are members of decent modding groups etc there is plenty of content and it's ever increasing.

76561198091442443,Recommended,431600,26356179,"Posted: 1 November, 2016",all,Desh,"Don't often write recommendations but this is one of those times. Going to write it in order of 'Pros', 'Average', 'Cons'.PROS:-Physics are absolutely on point. (Cars like the V8 Super cars, Go-Karts, touring cars and F3), The levels of grip given to each wheel at certain times, and the way the car 'dances', like it should in lots of cases, it's completely unmatched by any other sim . EG, taking a corner, and the FR wheel hits a bump, you don't just feel it amazingly well in the FFB, the cars weight shifts extremely well, creating more lean on the LF tyre, the suspension then reacts to it, changing grip levels of both those tyres and the movement of the car. The list goes on and on about the reactions of the cars in different curcumstances.  You can also feel the effects of the downforce much more through the FFB and car control. Take the Formula 3, at high speed the car is much more planted, but at lower speed the wheel requires far more steering input as the downforce becomes almost non-existant and you are rellying on mechanical grip. Also, the suspension physics are immaculate, low speed reactions to bumps and kurbs is great.-Force Feed Back, Simply unmatched. No other sim is even close, 'Nuff said really.-Management... Yes, you have to manage tyre and brake temps. If you have the HUD on, you can see your brake and tyre temps in detail. Don't keep your tyres and brake temperatures up, they become less effective.-Car list, is fairly vast.... Go-Karts/X-cross/V8 Super cars/trucks/F3 etc etcAverage:-Now one thing that got hyped, and rightly so, was the AI. The AI is great, far better than other titles I've played in Sim's. You can change their aggression, and skill level in percentage right up to %120. They'll do pretty well to hold their own on the track. But, and it's a big but, They also still hold big features that make you strongly remember they are AI. For example, AI does not have a clue what a blue flag is.... Imagine, you get out first in quallifying, get the tyres and brakes up to temp on that outlap, then full steam ahead down the Start/finish to start your flying lap. Just to be met with %50 of the AI coming out of the pitlane, and that don't react to blue flags.... It's such a simple thing that destroys the element of the AI supposedly being 'human'. Also when you change their aggression to 'extreme', they still are very cautious about passing you and defending. I lost my wing in F3, and completely removed myself from the racing line and slowed down to around 50mph, and moved right to the edge of the track, and there was still a queue of AI behind deciding on whether it's safe to pass me or not. Also, they don't defend as aggresive as this setting suggests, they often leave the door wide open. But the plus side in that is that they do try to counter attack..... Another note with the difficulty level, is it's too easy in some cases. I had the super Karts at Spielburg (I know I spelled that wrong), and I naturally have the dificulty set to %110. Within 17 minutes practice I was the quickest driver on track by .4 of a second... I reset the difficulty to %120, and within 45 minutes practice I was still the qiuckest driver by .3 of a second.  It should be a tad more difficult imo. 45 minutes practice, without ever driving that vehicle, should have me at the back of the pack somewhere...... BUT, In general race-craft, the AI is a huge improvement, and is actually fun and difficult to race against for the most part.CONS:-Graphics, it's not a huge dissapointment, but at some points it does feel very outdated. I'm running Maximum detail and it doesn't look right. I'm seeing jagged lines with Full detail and 16x AA. I feel i'm mising something, and the opponents cars give that old school floaty and pixelated look at 50+ meters. Maybe that's something at my end, but it's a bit of a turn off. Doesn't reflect the fun you have while driving though that's for sure.-Setting up the wheel. Now this is only if you are a perfectionist, like me. You may find yourself going back and forth changing the settings, but if you aren't new to sims and Race in the likes of iRacing, you may be more used to it. But it does seem to take a bit more effort. The con is only the time it takes, but it definitely returns reward when you dial the settings in.-Multiplayer. The public servers are a ghost town, everybody who has this Sim, and races online, races in a league no doubt.-Mods, I went searching for them on RaceDepartment. And there wasn't a huge amount. A lot of the tracks were made by 'Patrick', or something. And there are barely any quality tracks, the only quality tracks existing were the ones made by this 'Patrick'. One Gentleman said that this is down to the Devs not releasing info on the game to support modders making tracks, specifically the shaders. I don't know how much truth is in this, but it does go as a con in my book if it is truthful.Overall, if you're a heavy sim-enthusiast get it, just buy it. You are missing out on something amazing. But you should really look to get into a online league, because the Public MP servers are dead. Also, a league is just normally far more fun anyway than the public lobby bangers."
,Recommended,431600,25731235,"Posted: 27 September, 2016",all,Andre Davis,"I was going to delete my old review, but then thought it would actually be best to leave it up, because I don’t think my experience with this title is unique. In short, my initial impressions of the AMS were observationally correct, and yet simultaneously completely…utterly…wrong. You can read the original review below this one.After doing a little reading, I decided to reinstall the game and give it another go last week. This time, armed with a little pre-knowledge and a more realistic expectation of the setup curve, my experience was completely different.First, the force feedback. I own and play (PCars, AC, R3E, and rF2) and IMO, with a little bit of tweaking, AMS has arguably some of the best force feedback I’ve ever felt in a sim.  And by a little bit of tweaking, I mean simply adjusting one setting in the .ini file to dial out any clipping from the default settings. A small bit of clipping is perfectly okay, but the devs claim the defaults settings, allow about 20-30% clipping. Not sure what wheel they tested that on, but on my CSW-V2, the default gain setting for the cars in the base installation allows a little too much clipping in the high-speed corners for my tastes. Not a big deal, very easy to dial out. And once you do, the cars will feel amazing. :)Second, the graphics. This was a big turn off for me the first time I tried AMS. Yes, I realize graphics aren’t the end-all-be-all measure for sim titles, but, coupled with what I thought at the time was poor FFB and a poorly designed GUI, the outdated looking graphics made me feel as though it wasn’t worth the time to negotiate the setup curve of the title. What I didn’t realize at the time was, AMS’ built-in graphics processing is terrible, but you don’t have to use it. By turning off almost every in-game graphic setting, and simply creating a profile in my GPU driver for AMS, and allowing the GPU to handle most of the processing, I was able to use the enhanced HDR setting in AMS, and it looks like a totally different game—very much comparable to any other modern title. When properly configured through the GPU, the outdated graphics gripe basically becomes a complete non-issue.Third, the GUI. Yes, it appears a bit cluttered and hard to navigate, but the more time I spend with the title, the more I seem to be discovering the method behind the madness. AMS remembers the little things, like which track you were driving in each particular car and what difficulty level you were using with that particular car/track combo. The latter was a welcome surprise, considering AI difficulty often varies by car/track combo. I believe some of these little conveniences that have been revealing themselves are made possible, in part, if not completely, by the way things are broken down and organized in the GUI. And, to be honest, after a few days of play, the GUI doesn’t seem nearly as chaotic as it did on day-one. :)So, as much as I’d like to say, “Please ignore my previous review.” I think reading them both is best, because there’s a good chance you’re going to be feeling some, if not all, of the things I felt about the game when I first tried it a few months ago. The thing to remember is, while all my past observations were indeed true, they only apply to the out-of-the box installation. With a little patience—a browse through the community forum and possibly a Google search or two—the initial installation can be transformed into a real racing pleasure that should appeal to just about any sim fan.Verdict: AMS is a definite must have for sim fans.Below is my original review. :o--------------------------------------------I heard a lot about this game and was excited about the track evolution aspect. After downloading it, and selecting theNo Assistoption, I then spent about 20 minutes trying to find out why it was still auto upshifting for me. After a Google search, I discovered that selectingmanualwasn't enough (WTH??). There was a second setting for upshifting. Whatever, I moved on and started tackling the FFB. It felt promising, but when I went to start dialing it in, I realized there was no FFB meter (again... WTH?). I found a lot of information online, telling me to make manually adjustments in the config .ini files. That seemed a little archaic, and coupled with the lack of an FFB meter, I was just really turned off at this point.To make matters worse, the graphics are very, VERY dated looking, compared to just about any racing game made within the past 7 years. I have a GTX 1080 and had the settings cranked, viewing it on a 4K screen. It still looked dated. Even the onscreen HUD overlays looked like they were made for a kid's game.At the 1.5 hour mark, I just gave up an returned it. If I didn't already have three sims that I was thoroughly enjoying, I might have spent more time trying to massage AMS into shape. But there just seemed to be too much blind fiddling required.Verdict: Refunded."

The team at Reiza UNDERSTAND what it takes to make a satisfying sim, and no amount of slick graphics (Project Cars) substitute for engaging driving and gameplay. Let's take the setup of the cars and the physics:Reiza has refined and tweaked the ISI engine so that almost every car available gives wonderful feedback to the driver. You can feel when you are on the edge, and this is down to not only the beautifully tweaked physics but very importantly the customisable sounds including tyres and various balance controls enables you to get a very good idea of how fast you can push. Every clue that you need, both in sound and feedback, is customisable and exceedingly well done, including rumble strips, grass and dirt, and for me this is the only sim which offers believable reactions to being offline or offtrack. It also makes it much easier than other sims to catch a slide because you can feel what is happening to the back end of the car.Frankly I do not care whether the graphics are not to PCars ""standard"". Most of those are in any case a distraction from the job in hand: racing. The cars are very well done and despite not being fleshed out with bling like PCars are still perfectly good and crucially are way ahead in practical driving terms.The force feedback is (again unlike Project Cars with its frankly ludicrously complex FF setup - which doesn't have any clear explanations as to what the absurd number of parameters mean) simple yet highly effective.The AI in Automobilista is outstanding and superior to ANY currently available racing sim, yet Reiza are still working to refine it. This makes it by far the most satisfying offline racing experience.The one slight misgiving is the available tracks. It's not because they are mostly Brazilian circuits or somewhat unfamiliar, but that many of them are rather plain looking and consist often of very wide tracks with long, shallow or sweeping curves. Some make like these but I find them a bit samey and lacking in character. However I think Reiza Studios recognise this and are encouraging third party circuits and perhaps in the future will offer some classic tracks.Overall this is a very promising sim and despite being early access is already close to being a very polished product. Even at this stage it is far more polished and playable than either PCars or Assetto. It is also far more polished and offers much better quality content than ISI whose own content in rfactor 2 is falling way behind."

I currently enjoy R3E, AC, and Project Cars, and have found the experience with Automobilista lacking in pretty much every way so far. The much touted FB on the G27 is hardly ground breaking, and the graphics are only just a step up from rFactor 1. There are bugs in the program that result in the Config Tool crashing (which Reiza has acknowledged and a fix is apparently in the works), and the starts are a mixed bag of being suddenly swerving around as the game gives control to you, or a formation lap where the car doesn't actually go anywhere and won't respond to the controls.I realize this is an early access release, and I'm hoping that Reiza and their team can improve on things to clean it up, but if you watch OnWheelsTV videos on YouTube and get the sense that this is the next big thing in graphics, FFB, and car physics...well...so far it isn't.

There are quite a bit of cars and tracks that come with the vanilla game and the dlc is not priced that crazy.  I hear that wheel support is iffy but who cares, I race with a controller."
76561198027355942,Recommended,431600,25594838,"Posted: 19 September, 2016",all,Freespirit,"This game is one of the best racing simulators on the market. But to fully enjoy you really need a steering wheel. Then you can appreciate the physics and different car handling. The sounds are really great too, especially in formula cars, when you can hear the sound of the air passing the car in high speed. I also like the graphics. I know it's not the best compared to Assetto Corsa or Project Cars but for me the most important is actually the racing itself. The tracks looks very good for me, much better then in rFactor2 where they are using  very dull colours for some reason. Also the AI is much better here compared with the other racing games. Here you can see for example more often when AI drivers make mistakes (like in real life) which I didn't see in many other racing games. The downside of Automobilista is lack of dynamic weather. There is a 24h cycle but that's it. No wet racing :-( That's the biggest criticism. I also have noticed some AI issues, for example the AI drivers are for some reason much slower on corners, but on the straight line much quicker."

Since those problems mentioned above disappeared some time ago I've very very much enjoyed using this sim for racing and I would absolutely recommend it now for the quality simulation it provides."
