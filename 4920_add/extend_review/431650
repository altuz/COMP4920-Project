,Not Recommended,431650,29786157,Posted: 8 February,all,Azralynn,"See written article belowor watch it here:https://youtu.be/m6OsiFnI9kkTL;DR: SKIP TO CONCLUSION!Phoning Home is an atmospheric story-driven exploration survival game. You play as a mute robot named ION, and you crash land on an alien planet. With the guidance of the ship’s AI, you must find a way to phone home for help. Not long into your mission, you come across another robot named ANI. The two of you must work together as strange alien life emerges, and the planet itself defies the laws of nature. I find the story interesting, and I definitely get that Wall-E meets E.T. vibe, but with a different tone for the narrative.The majority of the game is essentially a walking simulator. Exploration is often necessary in order to find the resources you need to craft the tools you’ll need to survive. You’ll also need to guide, carry, maintain, and protect another robot ANI. I wish I could have just left her somewhere, but she requires upkeep. As far as walking simulators go, the game is enjoyable for the first couple hours, until I hit a large desert area From that point on I became so incredibly bored and frustrated trying to reach the objectives.After finally repairing the first tower, a storm came, and she said to go ahead and explore, and that she would catch up after the storm ended, so I did. The storm lifted, but she never followed, so I was unable to progress without losing a ton of progress (that I wasn’t willing to repeat). Autosaves occurred after I had gotten a fair ways away, so I couldn’t find my way back up again. After my initial frustrations with finding my way up in the first place, and ANI not following like she said she would, I did my best to finish up the mission without her, but couldn’t,  so I gave up. In hindsight, I should have manually saved more frequently, but I also think having to manually save often hurts the immersion. I think more options from autosaves to load might have helped a lot.Pros:lots of exploration, so having a scanner to detect and identify nearby resources and the compass for direction are good features in the gamesurvival mechanics are reasonable, and aren’t too bad to manage as long as you are actively crafting and exploringthe combat is a nice addition to add some excitement to the gameplay – you can take part in the combat, or choose to avoid it (the combat is easy, but some of the creatures spawning startled me a few times)interesting story (and I would have liked to have seen how it all turned out)environments look fantastic, the characters are adorable, and there are some cool creatures to seethe voice acting is done very well; and both the music and the atmosphere are great (I love the sound of the rain; it’s so pleasant, and calming!)Cons:you have to find the exact paths to take in order to scale the mountains in the desert area, but the hills are saturated with areas that LOOK like paths you can climb to get to the objective – I often found myself so close to the top of where I needed to go, only to be unable to climb or thrust any higher (invisible walls?), and then just slide all the way back down the mountain again; having this happen countless times ruined any hopes of exploration for me, and the game just became boring and frustratingthrusters are inconsistent – at times you barely get any lift at all, while other times you get decent height with the exact same amount of thrust power (it’s irritating to miss a jump and take fall damage because of itANI gets stuck, and doesn’t always follow when she should; a storm came, she said to go and explore and she would catch up after, but she never did – the storm lifted, she never followed, and I was unable to progress without losing a ton of progress (that I wasn’t willing to repeat)the game autosaved right as I was falling to my death, leaving me in a loop of dying (thank goodness I had quick saved and manually saved not too long before, but autosaves like that should never happen in the first place)you’ll be babysitting a lot – protecting and maintaining ANI is a neat idea, but it usually feels like more of an hassle than anything else, and she nags a lot when you don’t tend to her needs quickly(nitpick) if you don’t explore the right locations, you can easily miss out on a huge stock of resources that you will probably need (and maybe die without getting) – at one point in the game, I had to reload an earlier save to farm more resources before going into the next area, because I wasn’t able to progress(nitpick) the constant beeping of ANI got on my nerves a bit(nitpick) controls are customizable, except that thumb mouse buttons are not supported, and while the game has controller support, it’s as good as it could beI played the game for a bit over 5 hours, and the last 3 hours of that time I wanted to stop playing. The game has a solid start, but it grew tiresome. I would have liked to have seen how the story progressed, but unfortunately, I felt so discouraged that I lost the will to continue.Conclusion:Phoning Home looks amazing, sounds great, and has an intriguing story. I’m sure some people will enjoy it, and I’m happy for those who do. However, I cannot recommend Phoning Home, as I did not enjoy a large portion of the experience. Simply put, I was just not having fun with it enough to want to see it through. It’s not very often that I don’t want to finish a game, but this is one of those times. After walking around for what felt like forever hoping to find the correct path among hundreds of pseudo paths took simply its toll. My boredom and frustration claimed victor, and I stopped playing.If you like my reviews, please feel free to join my Steam group, and follow my curationshere.You can also view this article on my websitehere."
,Recommended,431650,31662301,Posted: 10 May,all,Andi,"I have never had a love/hate relationship with a game before... until now.Phoning Home starts out simple enough.  Find resources, craft items, and defend yourself.  Then it gets a little complicated.  Find ANI, craft items (for two), and defend both of you.  After that, it gets insane.  Take care of ANI, carry her over rough terrain, use a lot of your resources on her, tell her to stay or follow (maybe she'll listen or maybe not), craft items (again, for two), and she'll make pull your hair out.  Despite all of that, the story is engaging, the maps are fairly large, and there is much to explore.Pros:Graphics are very well doneA great story-lineA mystery unfolds as you play the gameVery challengingThe developers are actively updating and answering questionsCons:ANI slows down the game to a crawlThrusters are hard to controlThe island hopping level, some of the portals are deliberately hidden from viewThere are places where you can get stuckAfter it's said and done, the story-line is solid and this mystery had me guessing all the way up to the end.  I enjoyed finding resources and crafting items to fix something or to complete a task.  This game kept me busy for awhile and that's what it's really about.Unfortunately, ANI slows this game down considerably.  She moves much to slow and she doesn't always do what you tell her.  At one point, you both have to climb up a mountain to fix some radio antennas.  The first pathway is in front of you and easy to climb.  The other two are substantially harder to find.  The paths are not marked at all and what looks like a path may be a dead end.  This happens quite often.  However, it was only after a couple of play-throughs before I realized that the portals, more often than not, drop you off where you need to go, that's my fault.I encountered a few bugs while playing this game too.  The most notable was when I had to jump into a pit using the kinetic damper to break my fall... the ground was not visible.  I loaded my most resent save and that fixed the problem.  I also encountered a couple of trigger errors, but I sent my saved game to the developers and they fixed it.  I'm fairly certain that most, if not all, of the trigger errors that I encountered have been fixed, so that may not be an issue anymore.At the time of this review, Phoning Home was selling for $19.99.  Is it worth it?  Let's be honest.  There were times that I wanted to quit and play something else, but I stuck with it and learned much about the eccentricities of this game.  What's the bottom line?  Did I have fun?  Yes, yes I did, so... Yes it's worth it."

I love the *spoiler* little companion and it's cute little changes of expression whether angry or happy.  It's not a hand-holder.  You've got to figure out what is going on and how to progress. Graphics are great for and Indy or otherwise.  IDK I just love this game and am having a great time playing it.Highly recommended but it is NOT a mega-high-action combat game in case you were wondering. It's an adventure game to it's core.  One with an interesting story (that I'm still learning) and an interesting premise. You play as a robot with no knowledge of what happened after a crash landing on a strange planet.  From there you are on your own.Love it. Easily recommend and hope you do to.
,Recommended,431650,32032881,Posted: 28 May,all,Sir Pikachu,"I have seen this game a while ago and was just able to pick it up to play. I have to say this game is very interesting and has an in depth story behind it that you will slowly uncover while playing. There are so many good qualities about this game as well as not so good but overall the experience was worth it.Pros:- In depth story.- Survival Systems- Lovable Characters- Lengthy Game 6-10 Hours (I Completed my play through in game time at 5 hours 40 minutes but that doesn’t include the deaths, resetting to previous saves, etc.)- Good range of scenery (Forest, Desert, Snow, and Islands)Cons:- Sometimes the game doesn’t tell you what you need to do completely / Don’t know what to do next.- At one point the game tells you to get stocked up for a fight but in reality you just need to run.At the end I was satisfied with the game and the price point which i know is not for everyone, but is actually completely worth it in this games case. If you enjoy nice story type games with some survival elements then this will be the game for you. While you might get lost easily you will find yourself exploring and enjoying the world around you. It is lively and plenty of stuff around. I would rate this game a solid 8/10."

So you go explore for some goodies on the planet. You will somehow find one of you friends, a little robot too, but... she needs protection, so you must keep her ""alive"", protecting her...You will need a little fighting against the living of the planet, but the game is not a shooting one so you're not searching fight in there.Very cute, very fun and the dev team is active when you need any help!Regards,Urzah"
,Recommended,431650,34814244,Posted: 8 September,all,Necidious,"Okay so, I went ahead and decided to purchase Phoning Home because I liked some of the work the developer had done in the past. First things first, I absolutelyLOVEthe soundtrack and now I understand why there's an option to download it seperately — definitely worth a buy! It sounds truly astonishing and nailed it on making people immerse themselves in the game environment. Kudos to the composer! It can't get enough praise, really.Let's get back to the game itself. The main characters, ION and ANI, are adorable. The A.I. narrating, however, is a bit on the annoying side for me personally, but not to the point where I couldn't continue playing. When the game tosses you in the world, it's a bit hard to know where you're supposed to be going. Is that a bad thing? Not necessarily because the game world is pretty beautiful and it urges you to explore, especially knowing it's an indie game surprised me even more.I'm not entirely sure why people claim the game has bad optimization. Either their computers equal the computing power of a potato or they're simply lying. I don't think the game isthatdemanding. On my end, the game ran pretty smoothly with everything on maximum graphics.Do I recommend this game?Yes, definitely!It really nailed it on the aspect of exploration and connecting you to the main characters."
,Recommended,431650,31512569,Posted: 2 May,all,evercreepy,"Well, I'm really surprised, I haven't expected this game to be that awesome.I instantly fell in love with the characters and the atmosphere. The plot is so captivating, that I spent 10 hours playing first time I've opened the game, without even noticing. It's the first game in ages, that managed to keep my attention for so long. I'm glad I've discovered it.I'm loving everything about the story and how it's delivered. The soundtrack is so perfect, it literally gives me goose bumps. Let's say, if Phoning Home were a movie, I'd watch the hell out of it.I just wish the game were a little more polished. The constant struggle with quirky physics takes a bit from enjoyment (I mean, I ended up dying in textures more times than from any real in-game threats, and it can be frustrating).But all the other aspects of the game are so exellent, that I'm happy to overlook these issues and keep playing.Overall, Phoning Home totally goes in my personal top 10. Especially if there will be more bugfixing updates."
76561197992795604,Recommended,431650,33360341,Posted: 7 July,all,Angel Night,"I would like to give this game a good review, but I'm having slight difficulty doing that.  I was enjoying the game very much, up until I got ANI.  Now I feel like I'm being rushed through the game because I have to constantly keep her out of harsh climates and create items to protect her from corrosion, which means I have to be on the constant move to find more resources, which disappear fast when making items for both myself and ANI.  I was going to enter a bug report/idea to the creators of the game, that maybe they need to slow down the deterioration of ANI's protective coating or perhaps make her immune to the weather all together, like ION is, so the player can enjoy taking the game at their own pace again, but their website is nothing more than a video clip of the game.  I had high hopes when I saw this game in Steam.  I hope they decide to make ANI less of a pain to take care of so I can actually enjoy playing it again.  I suppose I'll just have to wait and see for now.  This game definitely has lots of potential and I believe many people would enjoy it so I will recommend it, but if you're like me and enjoy taking a survival game at your own pace, e.g. exploring everything, collecting resources, building a base, and making use of replenishable resoures, e.g. growing plants, then you might want to wait and see how the game develops before committing to it."

You play as ION, a little mobile unit, looking for a way off the planet your ship has crashed on. You find ANI who becomes your parter and helper, but its your job to keep ANI protected from the elements as your scour the landscape together for the items you need to leave the planet.There are puzzles to solve, safe places to find and entities to avoid or overcome as you collect, craft and search your way to success, all the while trying to keep ANI as corrosion free as possible.I really enjoyed this game and would recommend it to those who like these sorts of games."

76561198107051310,Recommended,431650,29924156,Posted: 14 February,all,jonen560ti,"A decent indie title bogged down by largely beginner mistakes.The premise and presentation is interesting. You play as an explorer robot named ION who crashlands on a planet that is rich with resoures and you need to survive and find a way to phone home(roll credits). The game certainly has personality, the character designs are pretty neat, a cross between Wall-E, Star Wars and ET most of the time. Your ship has a personality that brings a lot of Portal characters to mind and while not entirely original, it is one of the better takes on the humorless, business centered, arrogant robot companion archetypes and he is one of the games highlights. Especially when you find and repair another ship with a completely opposite personality and the 2 starts bickering. The companion robot, ANI whom you find later is a bit cliche'd. A feminine talkatative and somewhat impish robot who instantly falls in love with you. imagine if Wall-E was female and EVA male and that's pretty much their releationship. except ION is silent. At least they have an in-game excuse for this in that his speech chip is supposedly damaged, but still. Seeing ANI make several attempts at romanticising someone who can't even respond was initially cute, but after a while it became almost sad. overall, pretty good setup and characters.Now the gameplay is a mixed bag.  it IS a survival game so crafting and maintenance galore. the game isn't too stingy with crafting items and you do have a compass that shows you nearby items. ION isn't too hard to maintain either, even though he has 3 needs, fuel for rocket thrusters, power for sprinting, using weapons and staying alive and hull damage, maintaining them isn't too hard, they last a decent amount of time and items for restoring them are fairly abundant. i haven't had any issues there yet. however, when you find ANI, you not only have to repair her when damaged(no power or fuel needs, thank god) but she does corrode and you do need to make coatings for her to prevent that. and you want to because if she corrodes, her movement slows to a crawl and to my knowledge you can't undo corrision! and she doesn't do enough to warrant your attention. she can fight, but other than that, she is basically an escort mission. she can't teleport to you if she falls too far back, if a sandstorm appears. you need to find shelter or constantly craft coatings for her and you need her to progress. why can't she find random crafting items for you, perhaps give you fuel or power or teleport closer if she gets too far away, just something to make her more self reliant. how could she ever think she could even survive on the planet, if she was smart she would have stayed on her ship.Combat is fairly basic, fire a relatively slow moving projectile at usually slow moving enemies, movement is pretty good overall, the thruster is a bit wonky as it only seems to add upward momentum, aka don't use it if sliding because you will keep your momentum, a forward thruster would be great could have speed up the slow walking too. which reminds me, the walking is slow. it feels like the world is large and characters slow specifically to pad out the gameplay. note to indie devs, don't do that. most pc gamers already have a library filled with unfinished games due to a lack of time to play them. a short and sweet game is much better than a long sluggish one. fortunately, the devs are aware and have increased sprint speed slightly, but ideally there should be an upgrade or a forward thruster that significantly speeds you up.The gameplay has a good framework but isn't handled as well as it should. i'd love to see a sequel or a redux where all of these issues are fixed because there really is a good survival game hidden in there somewhere.as far as graphics and audio go, there's no issues. i've heard people complain about it being hard to run, i'm rocking a gtx 1080 and playing at 4K max with a near locked 60fps so i don't see any issues. but i'm also rocking the 2nd best video card right now period so. graphics themselves are well polished. not the best of the bunch, but art is quite coherent and some particles really impress. sound effects are also very pleasant, impressively so for an indie title. now graphics options are fairly basic. so is input options. gamepad support is shoehorned in there and just kinda works. it plays best with M\K.I think in summary, this is a potential indie gem that has it's appeal already, but a few dumb decisions, especially mid game, holds it back. Fortunately, the beginning 2 hours is a good taste of what the game has to offer so you can safely refund quite fast if you don't quite feel like it's up your alley. The devs have done a good job listening to feedback and patching, but i think a redux of sorts is needed to really leverage the game's potential. it's a recommend from me, but a cautious  one. I nonetheless wish the devs good luck in the future, i think they have potential"

And I might hurt the devs with a negative review, which I don't want to do. They surely put some effort into Phoning Home. The idea is excellent, but -as many other reviews say- the execution is far from ideal.I read that Phoning Home is a walking sim with a robot as your main character, where later on you additionally have to take care of another fellow robot. I was expecting something like FireWatch (a walking sim, but nicely done). I was disappointed.As much as the game is visually pleasing, the graphics just seem too heavy and poorly optimized. The robot moves too slow, which is really dull. The areas are too large and it feels there is not much to do, other than gathering resources, which are too scarse. And somehow gathering resources was not fun at all.I also feel that the game is overpriced. Yes, even with a discount.I was expecting a great storyline, but it evolves too slowly.Phoning Home is an ambitious attempt to create a successful game and the devs should be commended for that. Yet I seriously believe that the game needs rebalance and a faster pace.I'm sorry. Thumbs down."

The scenery and dangers that lurk within are well planned, and the puzzles are ingenious and make you think. This is a game I would highly recommend to anyone who wants a blend of survival, puzzles, and optional stealth/needed strategy in their life. The open world is truly an open world, although limited at the same time in certain areas. The map is vast is what i am trying to say. 10/10 you should try it out if you have the available funds."

I like the story line, guided missions, challenges, no poor language, etc.  Very smooth game with few bugs. Control mapping is very important to me and this game allows remapping.  Bugs and the inability to map controls can make a game so frustrating to play, you will loss interest.  I would like to see a range value to collectables with an added plus of an altitude.  Maps are common place in most games with a fog component, that would be another useful perk.  I suspect the Character Sister could repair ION and upgrade him with a map."

Had to reduce the graphics to cope with the lag from the constantly moving grass and trees plus the rain at the beginning. Everytime I jumped down off the smallest thing I'd have to burn fuel or take damage and scavenge more supplies; knowing that I would later have ANI to scavenge for, I can see where most of my time was headed. Just not into collection/crafting games anymore I guess. Still, I could tolerate all that more than having to listen to that annoying voice for a minute longer.

For instance, you can tell her to stay put while you go an explore some perilous situation, but eventually she follows you anyway.  WTF, ANI?  She also talks incessantly, but while every other AI in the game speaks words you can understand, ANI just makes R2-D2 sounds and her words appear on screen as text.  Remember this is an exploration game, so looking around and paying attention to your environment is important, but you now have the choice of (a) doing that, and missing everything she says, or (b) not doing that and reading all the words, then wishing you hadn't  because most of them are not important.

However I saw this game and it caught my eye immediately.After playing the game for a few hours now all I can say is wow! The graphics are fabulous, from the terrain flora and fauna to the night sky. This game is  extremely visually pleasing to the eye.The story progression is also very well done with comments from an AI that at times are very witty and amusing. However can become a little annoying at times.The crafting system is very easy to learn and understandable as with most games of this type a fair amount of exploring and gathering items to craft is inevitable but enjoyable to complete.Watch my lets play on my channelhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJcmAk9VUnqkMbHlptXhjAOqjTI3d0-pB"

There could of been more stuff in the world, like greater variety of flora. Another game where it rains when its clear out. arghhhh. The difficulty level was good except for the island hopping one and especially the big crashed ship at the end in the Lava area. The path to the  tetrarium storage area you needed to go and escape back out of was way too obscure.The story was great. Thought provoking. I wonder if anyone at the end didn't go with ani and sister and leave.Ani did talk too much though."

The game is a large bowl for each zone you go to and the word large is a hurrendous understatement each level is massive! however this causes serious problems with continuous gameplay. I was wandering pointlessly for about 3 hours collecting resources and just trying to find the next place i had not already been. THen finally found a portal which launched me into the next zone. However this was not how i was supposed to find it, so i ended up wandering in that zone for 3 days of gamplay, something like 7-10 hours of me playing. finally when i got out, it goes oh you just found a new area youll have to go back to explore and turn on these radio towers... which ai had laready done... so i come back expecting the game to go oh cool your done! but instead the game goes guess what time to redo all of the♥♥♥♥♥♥you just did! which would easily take another 2 hours of just walking to each tower.... UGH!the game has many paths to takle for each place you want to go but most are landscaped with invisible walls pretending to be slopes which are too steep.. and poison gas coulds which kill you before you even get close. It needs much refinement.I love the graphics, I love the Wall-E feel of the game, and I loved the expansive universe but i cannot in good concence recommend this game. After literally over 28 Years of gaming under my belt, i just cant. The game makes you feel lost and not in a story dialogue. You feel like you cant find the next step at all times.. and the clunky story line only being triggered wen you happen to be in a specific place, makes the game feel off balanced and painful to push through. A user should feel that the game is anticipating them and working with them on the adventure of the story. It should not feel like  I must go through in a very specific way, and only if i do it in the correct order will it unlock the next steps."

It is mostly story driven through your ship who acts as a narrator and guide. If you're looking for a relaxing, yet intriguing game, then buy this game. I am still early into the game, but the game has a lot of potential and already looks very polished and plays well. Well done developers!!!"

But then you turn around and start moving and all of a sudden she teleported back and you have to go get here.But as i said the game is new and refreshing, i like it so far even though its alittle rough around the edges so im giving it a thumbs up :)"
76561198011335672,Not Recommended,431650,34858381,Posted: 10 September,all,Monster,"I hardly ever write reviews, but I think this game deserves one. From all the games I played, it's close to the most *frustrating* game I know. Since it's a ""No"" review, I'll concentrate on the bad sides, and leave the good sides to others to describe.Assuming you haven't played it yet, I'd say that the game is about exploring, gathering resources, crafting tools and supplies, and looking after a ""suicidal girl"" (and that is my main issue with the game).My issues with it are:1) The ""girl robot"" is not immune to the environment, like the player is. There is no way (that I have found so far), to undo the damage. That in itself would be an acceptable gameplay element, if it wasn't for the following issues.2) The ""girl"" apparently cannot walk-and-talk at the same time! I only know one girl like that IRL; she's 90 years old and obese! If *I* was a girl, I would be greatly offended. ""My girl"" definitely agrees with me on this.3) There are constant sand/rain/snow-storms, which damage the girl robot. Guess when she likes to start to monologue at length about flowers and butterflies? Yeah, in the middle of the damn storms, which are literally killing her!4) You have some minimum ""thrusters"" that allow you to go up, but as you go up, you loose the ability to move forward, which makes it nearly impossible to get to some places. In particular, if you're on a mountain and it gets too steep to ""walk"" up, using the thrusters usually result in you falling down, rather the going up.5) The devs have refrained from using the traditional ""invisible walls"" at the edge of the gameplay area, so that you (or at least I), regularly end up ""outside"" the part that the player is meant to ""stick to"", and it's usually impossible to come back from there. So make sure NOT to overwrite your last save, and keep using new slots.6) To force you to at all put up with that ""girl robot"", there is one kind of resource you need to gather for the end-game, which only she can ""sense"". And if you somehow lock her ""somewhere safe"", than the game will literally make the resource invisible, until you go back and bring the girl robot with you.7) There is ""coating"" you can apply to the girl robot so she takes less damage. I assumed she took damage when it was all gone, but it seems the damage is a percentage of the missing coating. Of course, the game only clearly tells you that once your half-way through the game, and she's already half-dead.I haven't finished the game yet, and suspect I won't, either because the girl will ""die"", or because I'll get to the end, only to notice that I have only 46/48 required ""special resources"" to finishe the game, most likely."
76561197994972869,Not Recommended,431650,29914966,Posted: 13 February,all,Dr.Abscondus,"I can't recommend this game in it's current condition. There's a decent game in there somewhere, but it has serious balancing and control problems that make it a frustrating experience, especially in the later stages of the game. Lack of a map means you'll spend a lot of time wandering around the desert section looking for the single trail which leads to the top of each of the 3 mountains where the mission goals are located. Insufficient crafting materials that do not respawn means that you'll spend a lot of time trying to find essential items in the large levels going only by the jumble of monotone icons on the HUD. Nightime lasts far too long and I found myself simply waiting in cover (to protect the robot companion with which you are lumbered and which has all the durability of a dead slug) until daybreak. The single greatest problem is that you have to keep your robot companion in perfect shape through the entire game because you won't find out until it's too late that if it's armor or corrosion levels drop below certain levels they cannot be brought back up to 100%. The companion's speed decreases as corrosion levels increase so it lags further and further behind which means you can't keep a close eye on it's health while trying to find enough crafting materials for the both of you. You'll need a lot of those crafting materials due to the constant attacks by the various nasties the game world contains and for which your defensive measures are totally inadequate.Since I've reached the point where I have to mostly carry the companion, I'm just going to leave the game unfinished and check periodically to see if they've fixed the problems. I'd like to finish the game but I have zero desire to start a new game. The story just isn't that interesting."

I enjoyed the game-play, and found ION's ability progression quite nice.  All in all, this is a great game and I can recommend it in the current state.  It could use some polish here and there, and I hope the developers listen to players suggestions.PROS:Right from the start screen, you can tell the sound track for this game is fantastic.  I thoroughly enjoyed the ambient music, ambient background noise, sound effects, and voice acting.  Witty banter and engaging dialogue kept the story flowing and really drew me into this beautiful world.  I truly kept wondering what was going to happen next.  I feel like the core of a good adventure game should be an interesting story, and this game nailed it.The game looks great.  The scenery is beautiful.  It looks like the developers put a lot of work into making the game feel immersive and impressive.  The world feels large and the sense of scale of a little robot walking around the terrors of the world is striking.Game-play was enjoyable.  I enjoyed the gathering, crafting, and general mechanics of this game.  Controls feel responsive and I had no crashes, bugs, or other technical issues.CONS:There are parts of the game where if you don't have what you need, then you can get stuck and have to reload.  I had to reload 3 times at one point because I didn't have a certain flower before jumping down into a canyon.Not a huge fan of the AI pathing for ANI.  She kept falling off a cliff at one point on her own which became very frustrating.  Feel like that could be refined.The thrusting cool-down time felt just a tad bit too long.  I think the game would pace a bit better if I didn't have to wait 2-3 seconds between each jump.Gathering resources is fun most of the time, but can also be a bit tiresome.  I feel a lot of games of this type suffer from this mechanic however."
