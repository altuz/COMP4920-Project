Unfortunately, now in Epsilon Indi, she's under the investigation of the J.A.C., the corrupt space police. Between the rebel scientist, the priestess of a strange cult and the young man that want to be a Jackal, Gail and Sabina have to survive the encounter. And what surprise is in stock for them?This game is the sequel of Space Pilgrim Episode I: Alpha Centauri. So, you bet that you're familiar with the ship. The story is still well-written, with the same humor as before: Gail still in dangerous situation, not really trusting herself, Sabina still logical and in her world and now, on top of that, a young man overconfident with himself, a scientist that is too absorbed in his work and a priestess that makes sense but not really. You still have Galactic Hospital as the sitcom on TV and the cat Zubar, though he's not useful in this opus.The game is an adventure game made in RPG Maker - so don't expect any leveling or xp or any skill to upgrade. However, the gameplay is still take items, use them, combine them, examine them and discuss with people around (so that you can get more information about everyone). Again, you'll play two characters: Gail in the first two acts and someone else in the last one.The graphics are correct, though we lost Gail's goggles. Anyway, if you liked the first episode, you'll like this one and like the fact that you will have some other landscapes to walk in. The soundtrack is as usual good and the trick with intercom is still working: activate the music and you'll hear something else than the ambient sounds.Epsilon Indi is a little longer than the first game, given the fact that you have more to do around.Anyway, again, the price isn't a factor to prevent yourself to buy it. Go for it!"

I think the story is starting to get even more interesting now. Since you should have played the first game before trying this one out, you should have some idea of what this game will be all about from an aesthetic and gameplay standpoint. In this one, the intrigue continues as you have taken on more passengers and of course, something is not as it seems. Which becomes apparent when a J.A.C. ship boards to search your ship for fugitives. Anyway, I liked this episode better than the first. I will be interested to see where episode 3, not sitting in my library, will take us.Much like the last, considering the fact that this is an RPG Maker title, I would actually rate this 8 out of 10."

Why do you even wonder that the ship's AI likes more its programmer than you? As a female captain of the spaceship Pilgrim you are just a better stewardess to all of your problem guests. You'll encounter again many critical moments with a new 3 persons crew. This time you even replay an interplanetary escape with a cyborg and its creator. Highly expecting episode three ..."

Possibly more if some puzzles do puzzle you.There is slightly more mix of re-entering old rooms in this episode however, and I found myself wandering back and forth quite a few times looking for certain items, or when characters gave me instructions that were not clear enough about what computer to use etc.For that small amount of repetitive walking I did, I am thankful for the mouse support.About 99% of the pathing by clicking is really well done,especially in the suit on the space walk, which was really cool, and my character only messed up their pathing twice clicking across long cells, which is really awesome work to program the character to do that.The characters are still boringly cliche, such asanother priest/nun religious character, generic group of soldiers with one female added in, hardcore sergeant, immoral G-men/women running 'round with gloves of blue and not mysterious briefcases this time and a Kryten... ah, android,, but what is not cliche these days?The animation tiles in this game series look atmospheric to a tee.I especially love seeing the ship in space, and thespace walk looked great showing the ships hull, as did the ground sections on the planet, especially the cliffs/fence when you walk into the courtyard near the bin.As another journey on the passenger and cargo starship Quicksilver comes to an end and the familiar music comes on whilst the credits start to roll I am left with an excited smile to see what happens on the next episode of Space Pilgrim!Thanks again, and I anticipate when this series ends I will certainly be feeling the all too familiar, ""Firefly got cancelled,"" and, ""If only they had made a few more episodes,"" set of feels. This is, after all, the only set of RPG Maker games/episodes I have purchased and probably will ever purchase.Enjoy the game you smegheads.- Nerf"

As with the 1st episode, this one is self-contained, meaning that you don't have to play the episodes before or after to enjoy the gaming experience. But it certainly helps if you've completed Episode I first, as some elements of the story in this episode refer back to it.The Good- Ambience, setting, sound, immersion- Play as 2 different characters- More adventure game obstacles to solve compared to Episode I- Some puzzles were not bad- Fun achievements- Story, pacing and narration keep you interested- A good number of objects & environments to interact with & explore- Slightly longer in length compared to Episode IThe Bad- Having to go through the same tedious 3-step process each time with the airlock is a pain and time-waster- Flawed grammar in a few areasConclusionFun to play no doubt, but much like Episode I, is quite short.

,Recommended,431710,26309058,"Posted: 30 October, 2016",all,Royal Rambler,"This is the second installment of the Space Pilgrim adventure.It occurs a year after the first chapter.Some changes have obviously taken place seeing how quite a bit of time has passed.Some of the characters' past interactions have lead to the blooming of a friendship, and this is depicted in this second chapter of the SP saga.One of the passengers from back then grew closer to protagonist Gail Pilgrim (the pilot of starship 'Quicksilver' - where most of the scenarios take place in the former chapter).This friendship blossomed to such an extent that the former passenger now co-manages the starship with Gail. The character in question is also intermittently playable (which allows for a bit of variation & excitement). Meaning, the player is handed control over Gail first & then her friend when the story calls for it.In this chapter there is yet another handful of passengers on board (and some of these turn out to be allies, and others turn out to be antagonists), as was the case in SP1.The starship serves as both a passenger & cargo ship (meaning it transports people but also goods). And there's more of an emphasis on the latter in chapter II.And just like chapter I, the game is divided into 3 main acts, which each focus on a specific issue.The story now contains elements of one (playable) flashback (which is totally awesome and revolves around a trained individual who was meant to serve as a soldier, but somehow ended up as a fugitive).How this happened is explained & depicted as you play.It's interesting to note that the starship still looks the same as before and this chapter feels like a plausible sequel to the former (meaning the story makes sense and does unfold logically).The dialogue system has been expanded as well (i.e. more questions to ask).And I appreciate that very much :).NB: this game contains some brash language & risqué jokes at times (you've been warned!)Trivia:In the former chapter, there was mention of a particular organization (the J.A.C.) which was only named by it's abbreviated form.In the second chapter the role of said organization is clarified (i.e. full name is revealed) and further expounded, to such an extent where the subject becomes of great interest to the crew (and story in general)."

Like the first episode (if you played it before), this game will mostly made you to interact with objects and read the story.GraphicsThe sprites used are almost the same with the first episode with a few addition for other map with a different UI color. As i mentioned in the first episode review, the sprites and UI are used beautifully.MusicThe music describe the outer space perfectly, with its almost-nothing sound. The SFX is also used appropriately.StoryThis game happens around one year after the first episode. Unlike the title name, this episode has a standalone story from the first one, although there are some references. Like the first episode, this story is very short and well thought. Unlike the first episode, this episode ending doesn't wrap the story; there are some room for questions and mysteries for episode 3 and the story will be continued in that episode.The gameAs i said before, you'll mostly interact with objects and read the story. Although you might stuck at some point, all you have to do is just press your action button on all things you can find in order to advance through the story.I just replayed the game with mouse control and i realized that the mouse control isn't very comfortable to use (unless you are really lazy to play the game with both hands, that is). You'll need to be careful when you want to combine items, there is no button to bring the menu screen, and the autopath tend to screw you up when you are going to the kitchen and lavatory.Pros:- Short and well thought storyCons:- No dash button- Mouse control isn't optimized yet (it's hard to combine items, there is no ""menu button"", and the autopath tend to stuck when you are going to kitchen and lavatory)ConclusionThis is a short RPG Maker game about fugitives who disguised themselves as a passanger in a spaceship and the one who chases them.Should you buy this game?Yes.If you love to buy RPG Maker game, this one is a must. If you love the first episode, you better buy this game. However, if you are the type who think twice before buying RPG Maker game, because of its length, you might want to skip it or buy it when it's on sale."

There are more puzzles and side quest.  You also have to think further than your conventional thinking in a couple of sections in the game.The great thing about this game is its formula.  It keeps things simple and yet continues to expand the story and gameplay.  It builds on old relationships while creating new ones.  Gameplay is expanded by having side quest for each character but enough so you won’t lose sight on the main story.Chapter 3 is certainly in my future.

The graphics are nothing special, there's hardly any music or sound effects, but the story is nice and funny, just enough for this game to be worth it, considering its price.The only aspect of the game that really got me annoyed was the user interface. It took me way too much time to figure out where and how many times I needed to click to use or combine items. Also, whenever there's a dialog box open, it seems like the mouse cursor doesn't need to actually be inside the box to choose an option. Too many times I ended up clicking somewhere outside the dialog box (for whatever reason), just to accidently choose something to do or say.TL;DR - A nice low-budget point & click adventure.

Some of the original cast back for this episode and the banter between the 2 main characters can be entertaining at times. Good progression of the overall story and still makes for a decent stand alone game. Still I enjoyed the whole series, well worth the price."

The RPG tag on the store page is a stretch. If this game qualifies as an RPG then every game ever made that contains a character would be an RPG. There are no elements of character building or what you would expect from a role playing game. Your character has a preset personality in conversations and you are just piloting them from one puzzle to another.Don't buy it at full price, the game (each episode) has less than 2 hours of content. (It's about 6 to 8 hours to complete all 4 games ~ episodes)If you can get all 4 episodes (in a bundle) for under $3 on sale, then it's worth it.Game is not worth $2 per episode and not worth bothering with unless you are going to get all 4 episodes (they are too short to be worth much alone)Playing through once for the storyline was fun, but there's no real replay value.

New plot is quite intriguing and the cliff hanger is well done.It's a bit short so I'll say probably get it on sale, as I did for all of them.If you haven't played the first part, it's not that bad because there're barely any related contents to this part other than introducing the main chars, or very subtle that I haven't noticed. You'll see them mention the first part occasionally.For people who haven't played the first or other parts of this series, it's a RPGMaker game but it's not really traditional RPG that you battle and grind exp. It's more of a point-and-click adventure, with some minimal puzzles, mainly just combine stuff. So, don't expect anything more than a casual interesting story."

Once again we find the hapless captain Gail Pilgrim finding that, as usual, taking a load of passengers is never that simple.

Look if you played the last one, you know what to expect, if you enjoyed it you will enjoy this too. If you didn't play the last one,this story continues directly on from the last one, and I really don't recommend playing an episode in isolation, go and get the first one.Due to an awful action section involving robots that felt dramatically out of place Im only giving this one a 7/10 (It was going to be a 9)"

,Recommended,431710,23494482,"Posted: 10 June, 2016",all,Kestopher,"Space Pilgrim II kept me hooked from beginning to end. It was a late night shuffling through Steam games before deciding that it was time to take a look into the next Space Pilgrim episode. 2 hours later & before I knew it I was finishing the game. There is a creative story in this episode involving religious fanatics, mad scientist like doctors, and crooked cops. It has two of the main characters from the previous episode, especially Gail Pilgrim the main character. It gives you more of the interesting story telling, simple but fun problem solving, and interesting plot twists that you would come to expect from playing the first in the series. I appreciated the little astronomy lesson in the titles of the games as well. The style is obviously retro/RPGmaker, but the dialogue has some winks and nods to modern situations and delivers with the humor and suspense. These aren't the epic time consuming games that you will spend huge portions of your time to dig into and finish, but for a short narrative driven experience Space Pilgrim has delivered twice for me and I look forward to seeing the rest of the series.For more video game news & reviews be sure to follow the blogHttp://www.SublimeGameReviews.wordpress.com& follow on instagram & twitter @SublimeReviews"

There are new characters, as well as a few old ones. One of the good thing that this saga did right was the character development over the series. It helps you become more attached to the story and characters, in my opinion. This one, as well as the third one, went more in depth with the story of the Pilgrim universe.Epsilon Indi is, like its predecessor, filled with puzzles that you have to solve in order to advance, as well as filled with a few twists of its own to keep things interesting.An enjoyable puzzle and adventure RPG, however it's not without its flaws, concerning the length of the game. Like I mentioned in my other review, this one should only take about a few hours to complete, and that's why I'm rating this sequel another 8/10."
