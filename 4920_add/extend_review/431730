I even thumbed down a few for being so vague.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------** SINCE WRITING THIS REVIEW, THE DEV HAS UPDATED THE COLOURING SYSTEM! IT IS MUCH MUCH BETTER AND EASIER TO USE!! O:Let me say:It's like photoshop, but for pixel art. Seriously.PROS--+Super rad real time animation preview makes animation smooth+ onion skin lets you see what's on other layers when you're drawing new frames+ LAAAYERS+ work with opaque or transparent backgrounds+ layers can be transparent and have opacity+ incredibly easy to navigate+ YOU CAN LOCK UR LAYERRRS!+ super cheap animation program that's cute, simple and well made. (Google the price of others, like Ulead GIF animator 5.0)- able to save in basically any format (EXCEPT PSD. HOPING THIS WILL CHANGE!)-also has a tiny preview to show you what you're working on.- really really cool rotate tool, so your stuff doesn't get super fuzzyCONS?--~No crop? Seriously I can't find crop. If anyone can hint me that, ping me.- I hate that [ and ] don't change the size of the brush, but instead scroll through the colours. I keep messing myself up.*** crop DOES exist! The dev stated it's in SPRITE - Crop- no colour adjustment button. (in photoshop its edit > adjustments > adjust hue/saturation, but I wish we had one here so I didnt have to switch programs)-no opacity lock so you can't just draw on the layer without worrying about messing up others, but that's a minimal complaint.Lock alpha exists which lets me do that! Nevermind!It's still a new program and has so much potential.I hate trying out new software and have had my gif program for 18 years, I'm actually really really happy with this. I recently made a guide for this program if you're interested at looking at what it can do and how simple it really can be.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=630941660Enjoy!"
,Recommended,431730,33677454,Posted: 20 July,all,[CVNT] llamadoH,"Updated review September 25, 2017I have been using this program for a few months now. Today an update came out for it and it is top notch. For me, the two biggest improvements are that they added a gradient tool, and they made the symmetry option able to do horizontal and vertical symmetry at the same time. These are two huge improvements to me. This program really is great. Worth every penny.--------------------------------ALL BELOW WAS ORIGINAL REVIEW ON JULY 20 2017--------------------------------Great program.I got fired from my graphic design job a few weeks ago. I have been doing graphics for around 20 years. I have all of the Adobe software and several other programs. The day I got fired, I decided I no longer wanted to work for anyone else again and I decided that I was going to learn how to make a video game. That is what I am doing full time now.I bought Aseprite the day I got fired and learned the majority of the program by the end of the day. It is super easy to learn, yet is powerful enough that I feel more comfortable making my sprites in Aseprite than in the Adobe programs. It's missing a few key features like gradients, but from reading the update news it appears these are being added.One thing I would love to see (if it's not already there and I'm just missing it), is preserve transparency so that I can paint over top of something without worrying about my painting bleed off of the image. It's not a deal breaker though by not having it.Overall, this program is great. It's easy to learn and use, and it is powerful enough to make some great looking sprites and animations. I definitely recommend it if you are looking to make some sprites or pixel art."

I didnt know how to use blender and i found it quite hard to make any of my own assets so i just used ones online (i dont sell the games i was just learning the software) but i had an idea of a game i wanted to make but i wanted it to be unique.I was shown this by a friend on discord and i bought it. I was hoping i could learn... I messed around at first drawing stick men and simular things animating a stick move across the screen nothing special. Until i drew a shotgun. Alot of my friends liked it and the guy who told me to get the software told me to animate it so i did. At this point i had the software for not even a day and i made a shotgun gif. From there on i went to work, i made a working character and i made 10 different versions. I made alot of things to just use. I drew some art work too. Ive only had the program for a few weeks maybe a month and im loving it. It has put a spark in me and shown anyone can pixel art.Pros:+ Easy to use+ Unique UI style (Retro Looks like it was drawn in aseprite)+ Lots of features+ Can make very detailed images or low details with a few pixels+ Easy animations with no hassle+ Always has good performance+ Monthly Updates with new features+ Quite cheap (Although there are free options i prefer this due to its accesibility)Cons:+ There are free options out there+ Transparency options are annoyingOverall a very good program!"

It was so easy that I actually had fun doing it, having no experience with similar software, and having very little artistic talent. Very powerful and very user-friendly software.http://i.imgur.com/OAcqJZA.gifvUpdate: 11.4 hours in now, still loving the tool! I have made a few things, including two animations and a pixel fan-art of a little-known youtuber, as well as a few other small projects. Every project I worked on took a little over an hour, and each time I learned something new about the tool, such as the 3 scaling options (rotoscale is great for rounding and can create a great effect; nearest-neighbor makes a perfect scale-up pixel for pixel given whole-number scale-ups [i.e. 1x, 2x, 3x, etc.], and the other which I forgot), and the pixel-perfect assisted drawing tool, which is great considering I'm using a mouse.Here are the two animations:http://wtfisit123.deviantart.com/art/Bleeding-Slime-657694333http://wtfisit123.deviantart.com/art/Middle-Fingersplosion-657825987Update: 62 hours in, love the tool, and glad to see more stuff is being added in. Developer is quite responsive and seeks out suggestions. I've sought out more tutorials on pixel art and have been doing better, both with more sophisticated art and animation. The only feature I found lacking as time went on was group layers, and that is a feature in the beta. Still wonderful to use, intuitive, customizable, and fun to work with."

,Recommended,431730,26542193,"Posted: 11 November, 2016",all,KERNBOOM,"Before I started using Aseprite, I had already worked with Photoshop, GIMP and Paint . net.Each of these titles are great works, and serve their purpose.For sprites, I used Paint . net mostly, and I use Photoshop for my special needs.I was working with Paint . net on 2D animations to use with Unity, and somehow stumbled upon this software.What immediatly sparked my interest was the built-in ability to make animations, if you are working with any of the above to make animations, I am sure this sparks your interest aswell, as with the software mentioned above, it is tedious and time consuming.The reviews spoke of fast and positive results, they mentioned that the developer actively listens and responds to his customers, and is shaping the product to everyones liking.So I bought it for the low price of 15,00 euro, nearly instantly became pro at 2D animations, and even had the developer respond to my days old question about color palettes in the Steam Discussions. The reviews weren't lying!The built-in animation stuff works really great and your exported spritesheet is easily imported into Unity. Next to all that, it is the little things that make this software great, like the option to change the hotkeys or using the eyedropper to sample through several layers without having to click the individual layer. There is a lot of attention to user functionality.One thing that might scare you off, which was mentioned in the currently single negative review, is the interface. However, this interface serves as a really comfortable work environment for pixel art, although I can imagine this might not seem obvious to the average user. If this interface bothers you, there is the option to change it into a regular interface.There is a lot more positive and interesting stuff to say about this software, from the color palettes to the selection tool, but if you are looking for something to make your sprites and animations with, look no further and find out for yourself!10/10, HIGHLY recommended."

It never gets in your way, you don't feel like you are using some tools to draw and animate. You just feel like you are... Drawing and animating.I am not an artist, but I could do the best walking cycle I ever did in my life, in just around one hour, because I was just doing animation, not fiddling around the software trying to figure out things.If you know the basics of frame animation and know the main Photoshop keyboard shortcuts, you are ready to do some great stuff with this.I recommend this to anyone who wants to make animated pixel art, for games or whatever reason they want.I think it is also a great tool if you want to draw static sprites, but you won't be using it at its full potential.Even if you already own Spriter, I would also highly recommend this, since they work with very different kind of animations and could really complement each other."

Over the years I've used dozens of different softwares, all with there different pros and cons, but Aseprite has completely blown me away. The problem with most other software is that it tries to be good at too much. Aseprite is not pretending to be a full-fledged image editor like Photoshop. It is dedicated to pixel graphics, so you get a much better product for spriting.It's interface is ridiculously easy to use and if you are a beginner to pixel art, will be able to get creating like a pro within a few minutes. Aseprite doesn't drown you with an endless supply of weird options and settings you'll never use. The tools it does provide are simple but powerful, and encompass everything you need for pixel art creation.They have a trial available, which I recommend, but after using the trial for a few short minutes I was sold."

I bought the Steam version after forgetting key details to recovering my account from the DRM-free version. The creator, David Capello, personally read and discussed my situation via his support e-mail. Despite us not finding any way to recover my account, I accept full responsibility for the loss of my original copy and I'm surprised and thankful for the lengths he went to in order to help me.Using the program is like lucid dreaming for sprite art. I never considered myself a pixel artist before, but I've been drawing for as long as I can remember. With Aseprite, pixel art is not only much easier to make and feel motivated for, but every 'gripe' you'd usually have wondering about the ease-of-access of a program is already a feature, leaving little room for wanting to make excuses for it.In short, Aseprite is a phenomenal program for pixel-art and flips the script.

Take of it what you will, but an hour was all I needed (and the 15 dollars to buy it.) .Why?DawnBringer's 32 color palette was the default palette. Considering the tiny amount of work I've done with a limited palette (no ""dirty"" brushes) has been with this palette, I felt at home with this program almost instantly (Disclaimer: You may not feel as comfortable as soon as you start it up like I did. Trust me, it won't take too long.) .Ok, so the palette isn't the real reason I love it. You can set up your own anyways, just thought that was awesome.Working with it is easy for any beginner pixel artists or anyone new to the program (like me), while still powerful enough for professional artists. The pixelated interface is a nice touch, too. Dunno why that one guy was complaining, a round/smooth GUI would look strange (If you have no idea what I'm talking about, some guy gave a negative review because the GUI was pixel art itself.) .But what is (what I think) the one thing that makes this worth more than some free digital art program?LAYERS AND ANIMATION FRAMES ARE SEPARATE! That makes both simple and complex animations FAR easier to make. It functions a bit like other animation programs out there (I've had a little experience in Adobe Flash). What does this mean, you might (or might not) be asking? You can edit an image in different layers (like Photoshop layers), then move on to the nexxt frame of animation, while keeping the layers of the image!I already have a small project in mind to use this program for, too! I will takeTHESE(I made these back in an animation/image editing class. I used Photoshop for them...) and redo them (unposterize, if you will) while using the same 32 color palette.Oh yeah, and you can make sprite sheets for games.

I struggle with animation because I'm still learning and this has made it so much smoother for me. It's very easy to learn and get a grasp of and it works well. It's a really excellent tool and I highly recommend it to anyone that does pixel art, or is interested in starting.I love that it's fairly simple, its very straight to the point. But a major point for me is that it easy to use and manipulate symmetry tools. Things are so exact with pixel art, and you do so much stuff that needs to be exactly the same, copying and pasting, then flipping and checking the work in Photoshop isn't a huge deal, but it still sucks. I've been wanting pc software that did this simple task but it's been difficult finding one that I could also get the hang of.This has just, it's filled all the gaps I've had in my process while also taking over tasks for others. It's really helped me understand what I'm doing better too, I think just because it is so straight forward.AND MAAAAAN, ONLY $14.99??Way worth it."

Aseprite has the Scramble Tool!While it's easy to draw something in any sprite editor, Aseprite has ""Pixel-perfect"" drawing, so you don't get those weird jagged lines when you try doing something like a curve, and ""linked cels"" which don't change with every frame, so you don't have to do any cut-and-paste into all the frames like I used to. The downside is that, if you accidentally forget to unlink something, it changes in all the linked frames. The good news is you have unlimited undos, unlike some of the other spriting tools I've used.There's also things that other spriting tools have, like layers and palettes, and while Aseprite has some cool layer stuff, I haven't used it much, and if I were to talk about the palette editor, we'd be here all day.Aseprite is worth the $15. I may have gotten it for free, but the amount of quality put into the sprite editor is enough to give away the price tag by itself. It's a nifty little thing I've already spent 100+ hours on, in the month I've had it for."

,Recommended,431730,25141240,"Posted: 25 August, 2016",all,agameraaron,"A really good pixel art editor. Arguably the best, but does lack some features other pixel art editors have and has some minor issues of it's own.---The features that impressed me include the palette editor, complete with many presets from classic hardware and other platforms. The animation editor comes with onion skinning. Each frame of the animation retains all the same layers in a matrix of frame & layer data. The freehand tool works very well for certain lines & shapes when drawing as it prevents the raw jaggedness of the shape as it would normally be rendered. The interface is just perfect for low-res pixel art.Dither & pattern features like Graphics Gale and some other pixel art softwares have is disappointingly missing. It is particularly useful with the bucket tool. Another nice feature would be to allow selecting a portion of the animation to preview, like when I highlight certain frames it should use only those frames when I press 'play animation'.---I have found 2 issues that are only in the Linux version as far as I know (if you use Windows or OSX, skip this):Sometimes the layer itself will copy and leave a highlight around it inside the animation editor that I can't get rid of without closing the tab. This is because it retains focus or something (I can't pin down the cause for this issue).The second Linux glitch is that Alt does not provide a functional eyedropper tool for me (using MATE). It shows the eyedropper in place of the cursor while it's held, but it does not process clicks for color swapping. Still, it is a reassignable key and setting it to something else bypasses the issue. I had gotten so used to Alt though...---Overall, it's great software that's near perfect for a pixel artist's needs. It's drawbacks are annoying, but that does not stop it from being the best pixel art software on the market despite all that.I will update this if the above features or bugs are addressed. Thanks for giving this one a read."

There is also the major cost difference between the two apps.Well thought out!Aseprite features a lot of the same basic handy functions that Photoshop offers like easily dragging your canvas around. Several selection tools, works great with moving pixels around and on layers.Offers a really nice resizing tool that moves your pixels in a very nice way, which is great for animating as well.You can import video files for animation reference and tracing.Has very easy and clever default keyboard bindings allowing you to speed up your work a lot.One thing I was a little worried about before purchasing Aseprite was the pixel GUI, thinking it'd be awkward to use. After about 5-10 minutes playing with the app, I hardly even notice and find it to be pretty nice.If you're out searching for a pixel art app, I recommend giving Aseprite a try."

Still, that's not a good enough reason, hmm... maybe the fact you can just have onion skin, resize the pic without it being blurry or distorted (I'm looking at you MS paint), cutting / cropping will be shortly added, fully capable of being a professianial software... ehh, it's my best shot.^ People will probably be very mad at this part. ^I would not recommend you use a touchpad mouse (laptops, mac, linux, etc.), I would say right now for this software to be properly used if you have a mouse, it will be less stressful for any use of this software and it will take less (or much less if you are like me with my works).In conclusion, I would give this software a8.5 / 10for what it offers and what if shows off.

,Recommended,431730,29325655,Posted: 17 January,all,A.G.¥10,"This program has some incredibly frustrating idiosyncracies, but also a strong core featureset, and a lot of potential.First, am I the first to say this? The chunky 8bit stylization wastes an ungodly amount of screen real estate in the GUI. The minute I saw it in the trailer I thought it looked gaudy, gimmicky, tacky,  unnecessary and wasteful. I'm trying to draw some basic sprites in an efficient interface, not pretend I'm using an ultra lo-res monitor with an 1980s microcomputer. Lets keep in mind I paid for every inch of panel space I have, and if a program just throws it away, I'm basically losing money. I also finds this stylization highly distracting, though that seems to have been the opposite of its developer's intention.Intention vs. Implementation:The first problem is that it wastes so much space.Another problem is the icons become cryptic. It was very hard to figure out very basic things about the program, which doesn't yet have a huge community online do draw knowledge from.Here's the big one, something the dev probly didn't consider.This interface looks *nothing* like any productivity program I have running on my computer.And herein lies the big issue, I am constantly having my eyes pulled to the GUI elements looming in my peripheral with their (as of 2016 at least) highly sylized blocky pixels. That bold, jagged, upscaled unicode font is constantly screaming at my eyes to look at it.I would love to just have this look like my normal computer, which is running in Classic mode, AKA it looks basically like Windows 98.I edit video in a program that doesn't look like a piece of glass candy. My eyes ignore the UI and focus on the content I'm making. It's lovely. Importantly, the interface doesn''t *match the content*, so my perception never blurs the lines.There are some serious concerns I have with the default layout. I was unable to find any way to change it on Google and the program does not make anything about itself obvious. I was finally able to change it thanks to developer response(thank you), and I can finally get to setting up a workflow.Overall the program performs well, hasn't crashed, and the thing that has frustrated me the most is that these issues stood in the way of me using a program that does have basically all the features I need.UI scalling has steep gradations only. Everything is too tiny or too huge.Same with zooming in/out. Going from 100-200% in a single scroll-whell step is not very helpful.Preferences menu will hopefully see some expansion in general.a ""Dark"" skin would also be a godsend, as with all productivity software.I have only used this program for a couple hours. I will likely update this review with more notes once I hit hour 40."

It lacks Photoshop's ability to show me a single layer out of my stack and then go back to the visibility setting I had before; and this was especially frustrating when the onion skin doesn't seem to work if there's a layer below it.On a personal note, I would have liked to be able to nudge the layer by pressing arrow keys when the move tool is active, but as that input is used for changing frame/layers I can understand why it doesn't.

After watching the trailer video and seeing the animation workflow, I decided to give it a chance, and man I'm glad I did.For anyone who has used flash, you'll feel right at home. The interface is similar and feels just as robust and 100x easier when making animations. Being able to draw/animate each piece in a different layer gives you a lot of control and ease, also for anyone who has used GG, they should know the frustration in editing multiple frames of the same layer and/or setting up sprite sheets after you've completed your animation. Aseprite does all of this automatically, and god does it speed up workflow!One of the most surprising and powerful features of this program is the Pixel-Perfect option which lets you draw freehand (with a mouse even!) and get fairly correct results when drawing. I would advise to not rely on this tool, but it helps tremendously in learning how a line works, or why a line you made doesn't work.I also enjoy the option to change from a color wheel, to a color spectrum when picking my colors; and also being able to pick different colors from modes such as Analogous, Complementary and Triadic. (This just makes color theory something you don't have to master to have great colors in your art.) Also the default color palettes are great (really love having a NES palette) and I hope to see more implemented!Exporting is super easy and simple as well! You can keep your file in .ase format (so you can keep your layers and animations exactly how you left them) and when you're ready to export them into your game, it's as simple as hitting CtrlL+E. I can't tell you how much of a blessing this simple little feature is, and how much time it saved me.The only two issues I've run into so far are-1: Lag seems to be a problem when making the color wheel/spectrum larger.2: After playing and then stopping your animation, the layer defaults back to the top. Not knowing this at first caused me to draw on the wrong layer which was frustrating. After I figured out it did this, it was just something I had to be aware of, but annoying none the less.I've only scratched the surface of this program, so the issues I presented may have easy fixes I'm not aware of, nor do they take away how great this program is! If you're an aspiring artist, or a veteran in game design, I would definitely recommend this program. You cannot beat the power and simplicity for the price IMO."

Also, the dev is always performing evolution on the program so you can get some nice features from time to time. These new features is based on the user's feedback so you can count on the dev to stay tuned on what the users want in the program.I created no only games with Aseprite, but animations, backgrounds, icons and so on.Aseprite is completely user friendly in such a way that you need almost no previous experience with editors to start using and with a fast research under nicely made tutorials you can learn the program's features in no time.It's my favorite pixel, animation and icon editor ever."

There are lots of export options to fit the need of your development. The command line interface I haven't used yet but it should suit your needs fine.

It is also a very good one.It almost handles like Photoshop and MS Paint combined and if you're familiar with either software you'll be able to adjust in no time.There are three features that I like very much: the ability to create [Layers] and [Frames] plus the ability to [Play] those frames. Layers functions similarly to the one in Photoshop. Frames one the otherhand lets you create a  subsequent image you can edit. Then you can Play the Frames with a press of a button to see how well your animated sprite is coming along. Together  these features makes animation a lot more easier.It can also open files of different image formats. So if you want to trace an image you have hand drawn, you can load it, copy it and paste it on a layer.Even without being on sale, the price of this software is affordable.I recommend this software. It's a buy."

It is clearly designed by someone who understands pixel art deeply, and as a result it is full of tools that are actually useful and usable. The UI is quirky but fantastic. Best of all, the price is totally reasonable. One of the best functional software purchases I've ever made.Important tip for people who use Linux:I have had issues on some but not all Linux systems with stuttering graphics. If you have this issue the fix is quite simple, by default Aseprite has the screen scaling set to 200% and the UI scaling set to 100%, if you swap these two things will look mostly the same but the stuttering will be gone. Hope this helps someone!"

There's no map making / tile library capabilities but that's not really the point of it.  If you need to create still or animated props or characters it has tools with good sub-options (like single pixel width line drawing) and a robust drag/drop timeline system.  Good saving / export options, good palette options, good preferences / customizable keys, good hints such as grids / onion skins and so on.The interfaces own pixel style might be a little weird for some, but otherwise there's not a huge drawback to it.
