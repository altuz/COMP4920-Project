,Recommended,431770,20876873,"Posted: 31 January, 2016",all,Shmoo,"This game is a ton of fun, and definitely worth $3.PROS- Easy to learn, strategic play- Hilarious positions & situations- Insane blood effects & limb removalCONS(Because it's early access)- Hotseat only, meaning you have to share a mouse. I plugged in a second mouse so players don't need to be right next to eachother, but you're still sharing the same cursor.- No graphics or control options at this time. It defaults to a 16:9 resolution, but it maintained proper aspect ratio on my 16:10 monitor.- Game is silent (I recommend playing The Matrix soundtrack in the background).SUGGESTIONS- Controller support.- Graphics options.- When a fight is over, play the fight back in real time.- More weapons and arenas.- Character customization.- Steam workshop support (for the previous two bullets)."

,Recommended,431770,21231028,"Posted: 15 February, 2016",all,Eroing,"A wonderful, simplistic little party game.. easy to learn - hard to master.. it's like toribash light, it doesn't take ages to learn, just click and drag the body part and the timer goes down as you drag.However.. there are a few cons which are present, but it might just be that they are not present YET..* No replays.This is not just a game about winning, it's a game of wits and doing nice moves, even if they don't make you win. A replay at the end of each combat is a MUST for the future!* No sound or graphics settings.Given I've only played this game for a very short while, I might just not have found them yet.. but the main menu only has ""start"" or ""quit"".. you can still use alt + enter to enter / exit fullscreen though.Conclusion?For 3€ - it's a must have! Since it's, to me, not only about winning.. you don't really need a friend to play it with all the time, even though it's even better with a friend.. I'll let you know after the coming weekend! ;-)so..To be continued..."

Its really statisfying seeing your weapon touch the skin of your enemy.This game can be related to toribash, only this is a bit more casual. This game is also in early acces and that means that this game will get more content overtime to make the game even more awsome.It has great potentional and not a big asking price. give it a try!(here is a video about whats in the game at the moment)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMiJTPIjyhc"

,Not Recommended,431770,31739850,Posted: 13 May,all,II,would be better if it didnt suck so much.So for more in depth feedback:- If you arent playing incredibly slow and defensively you will lose every time which makes the game boring and quite tedious to play.- Once your character gets damaged to a certain amount you can move a very large amount more per turn due to the momentum.- The UI and graphics look like it was designed by a 14 year old who took a half year course of graphic design in high school.

I would say that even £1.99 is probably more than one should sensibly be paying, taking into account how much content is actually in the game at the moment, however I believe it has potential and really, £1.99 isn't exactly a whopping pricetag so potentially give it a go, show some support and maybe we'll get more stuff in-game?"

Super fun for two as intended, but sitting at home on my laptop, actually weirdly enjoyable to play both yourself XD That said, will be great once the networked option is up.Rarely glitches, and it's a super quick load so it's easy enough to exit and reopen. Super indie local game, really glad to find one so great. Props to very young, very personable, super chill dev."
