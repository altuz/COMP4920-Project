,Recommended,431850,25218506,"Posted: 28 August, 2016",all,Audish,"Period games are always a pleasure to experience for the effort put into their style. High fantasy and glossy sci-fi are endless, so titles that hearken back to antiquity or forgotten decades bring a welcome change of pace. Projector Face makes the most of its Great Depression-era silent film look, and fortunately has enough adventure game substance to match the style.From a forgotten attic in the woods comes The Projector, a peppy little reel-to-reel that you might remember from elementary school if you're as ancient as I am. Somehow The Projector forms a body out of a pile of old clothes and sets off in search of that most precious of treasures, friendship. This is easier said than done for a machine-man with no mouth, and that's where the puzzling in this adventure game comes in.Every couple of screens you'll encounter scruffy children to befriend, but with no way to speak you cannot get their attention. Some exploring and puzzling in the area will reveal a film reel and bits of film you can splice together into a show for the children. The aforementioned puzzling is the usual finding/combining/using items, luckily with more sensical solutions than a lot of adventure games offer. You'll have plenty of challenges to overcome, with none holding you up for too long, I'd wager.The charming story is told solely through actions and silent film title cards. It's a great feel for the game, especially paired with the dilapidated environments of the Great Depression. There are drawbacks to the silent film theme, though, as your mute protagonist cannot describe items or give any feedback on puzzle attempts besides shrugging. And while the art style is perfectly fine the animations are severely lacking, as is the sound design outside the old-tymey soundtrack.Projector Face will last you about an hour, during which the story will run you through a surprising spread of emotions. It might not be particularly long or challenging but the puzzles are solid and getting things done is plenty gratifying. The game picks up once you start entertaining the children with your films, and has a few twists and turns before settling into the ending. Any fan of adventure games will find something to love in Projector Face, even if it is short and sweet.Did you enjoy this review? I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope you'll check out more of them athttps://goldplatedgames.com/or on mycuration page!"

I was never stumped, and it's quite linear (substantially due to its short length), but I had fun.Perhaps better for ""non-professionals"", and I wouldn't suggest paying full price, but on sale for under $2, I think most players will be satisfied.(Spoiler: Teddy bear violence!!!)"

Like most adventure games of this type it is devilishly tricky.Feels like a (silent) David Lynch movie crossed with Fallout, minus the ultraviolence. It has an innocent charm, but a sinister undercurrent, so I'm not yet sure if I should let my kids play it."
76561198042646749,Recommended,431850,29323196,Posted: 17 January,all,kris.aalst,"Projector Faceis a point & click adventure game about a projector who gets a body and goes outside to try and befriend the local children, even though he can't talk. Gameplay is your classic 'gather items and use them on objects in the game world or on other items in your inventory'. It's a very short game: it will most likely take you about an hour to finish it. It's also pretty easy. Sometimes, you'll have to think about what to do next for a moment but it's always a logical solution so you're never really stumped.Projector Facehas 5 Steam Trading Cards. You'll get 3 while running the game. Some of the cards go for insane prices at the moment and others for a more usual price. There are only 5 Steam Achievements and you'll get 4 automatically while going through the game. The 5th achievement is obtained when you finish the game without making a single mistake, which adds some form of replayability: if you want the 5th achievement, you'll get to test your memory after finishing the game once (or you can use a guide, of course).I recommendProjector Facebut only when it's heavily discounted (-66% or better) because it's so short and basic. It can be a nice introduction to the point & click adventure genre for casual gamers, or an easy break from the baffling adventure games some experienced players may prefer."

Even at $5.00, it was a bit overpriced for how short the game is.It was kinda cool. The story was unique.I had to think on a few of the puzzles.If $5 isn't too much for you, so ahead and get it. Otherwise, get it if it goes on sale for 99 cents or something.I just wish they had made a few more movie clips you had to find, etc.Oh well."
76561198261972637,Recommended,431850,29025801,Posted: 4 January,all,Tunnel,"I stumbled upon this game when it was on promotion and thought it might just be a generic point & click adventure game so I didn't expect much from it. However, after playing through the game I was so glad that I found it becuase it gave me such a joyful experience and it made me hunger for more games like this.As soon as the game menu showed up, I was intrigued. The black-and-white menu was like a stage with spotlights focusing on your mouse cursor as you scroll through it and the backgroud music was very cheerful and relaxing as well, all of which made me feel like I was sitting in a theatre waiting for a movie to begin.The protagonist of the game is a projector with a human body, which you may already known from the game's name and screenshots. The story of the game is very simple: projector face wants to make friends with kids, but apparently, a projector can't speak, so it's not gonna be easy for him to accomplish his little dream. Projector face wants to make the kids happy, but it always gets messed up by himself in the end, which makes you laugh at his ackwardness but feel sorry for him when you see him frustrated. The soundtracks fit the game perfectly as if they're connected to the mood of projector face. They're delightful when projector face meets new kids but immediately switched to the sound of howling wind when he becomes upset. The cartoonish artstyle of the game makes projector face even more likeable. Although most of time the game made me smile, the ending left a bitter taste in my heart.Another feature of the game that stands out is its narration style. The game takes inspiration from the silent films in the old days as it uses intertitles to push the story forward, which is brilliant in my opinion. It brought me back my sweet memories when I first watched Charlie Chaplin's films many many years ago.The puzzles in this game are logical and interesting. You need to collect all sorts of items and figure out how to use them correctly just like other point & click adventure games. In the meantime, you also need to keep an eye for film reels and reel frames, as projector face likes to show films for the kids. There is some replayability if you want to get the hidden achievement or just to enjoy the colorful world in the game again.My only complaint about the game is that it's too short. It took me less than an hour to beat for the first time and the game ended when I was still immersed and enjoying myself. It's not a big deal anyway as the game was good to the last drop for me.Considering that the game lasts merely about an hour, the full price may be too high for some people, but from the perspective of a point & click adventure games' fan, I think the price it's fair. To be honest, I'll definitely buy this game again for 5 bucks if I could, just to show my appreciation to the devs.Well, that's about it. This long♥♥♥♥♥review is a proof of how much I love this game."

76561198220791780,Recommended,431850,24411314,"Posted: 19 July, 2016",all,rainbowthefox,"I saw the game on Greenlight and just HAD to follow it until it became released! The game hosts a creative and uniquely-made main character. A stored projector that came to life and searches for friends using its only form of communication. The effect is a bit repetitive, what with the communication failing for the same purpose, but it still serves a sweet attempt from The Projector. I can't help but love him because of his loneliness.I like the art and animation because of its simplicity. The walk cycle for the main character is a bit rough and could be smoothed out for a better experience for the players. But I do understand budgets and the small group of creators/developers, so it can be tolerated. The animation for background characters are nicely done, though.One of the achievements are broken, and I was a bit dissappointed from the ending of the game. I do like how the storyline played out, though. It ended on a sad note, and I love that. We need more stories that don't always have happy endings. I was glad to see another character with a unique concept, too.Definitely a recommendation if you love point-and-click games!"
,Recommended,431850,23353076,"Posted: 2 June, 2016",all,Kippesoep,"It's a little short, but I quite liked it and I look forward to seeing your next project. The format lends itself really well to having the ""silent movie"" type cards -- which I thought I'd find jarring when watching the trailer, but didn't. The videos the projector displays made me laugh out loud (literally out loud, which is very uncommon for game jokes as they usually only make me smile) and with the third movie I found it quite funny to get someforeshadowing of what the twist would be from the last frame visible during the assembly.Other things I liked:How you made the most out of having just a few locations -- having to go back to earlier screensObjects being used, sensibly, multiple timesThe surrealism and bleakness of the wonderfully drawn world. Things like the crashed car being there long enough to rust and the general state of disrepair in the world contrasted nicely with the playing children. The projector even seems to clean it up slightly as he goes along, which I interpreted as symbolic of his good intentions.The music. Simple, but appropriate.Logical puzzles -- I'm hardly a very good player, but I finished it in about 45-50 minutesThe projector looking dejected simply by facing downward in the last actThe endingit seems appropriately sadI got the feeling there are multiple endings(, possibly a more cheerful one), especially as I only got 4 out of 6 achievements, but I haven't been able to find them.Is the area behind the red double doors the prison? It is the only place that cannot be reached from the outside and my instincts were to take the photo there at the end."

,Not Recommended,431850,32723703,Posted: 24 June,all,Don John,"""All the feels"" as the kids today like to say.  I loved the character and story of this game, but I found the logic of a lot of the puzzles to border on insane.  If you play a lot of point and click adventure games this may be more your speed, but if you aren't a die hard fan it's just frustrating.  If this had been a short film I'd cross my fingers for it to win awards, but as a game I can't recommed it."

Quirky storytelling and intuitive puzzles made this an enjoyable game, though it is rather short.

76561198309189955,Recommended,431850,26708421,"Posted: 20 November, 2016",all,Artscapades,EDIT: Given the new information the only really negative thing I have to say about this game is that for some reason it doesn't start in the game default language which is English. It instead stared in Italian. This change makes me quite happy with the simple little point and click game that it is.Simply choose the launch configuration tool option rather than the play option the first time you play to change it as there isn't an option in game to do so.It's a cute little point and click game. The problem I found is that I would have been perfectly happy with a no words approach but there are title cards in a different language that give it a silent movie vibe. However because I didn't understand the other language I knew that as I was playing there was story that I was actually missing. It's not like the whole game is in the other langauge the options screen is in Engish but I just feel that knowing I was missing story ruined my enjoyment of what is otherwise an adorable little game.
