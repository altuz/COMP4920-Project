The graphics aren't that great, but it doesn't affect gameplay adversely. For only $5 this is a neat little thing.I was wary about putting down my money after seeing the front page negative review going into detail about the game, but at this point most of his complaints are not as he described and have been fixed."
,Recommended,431870,31471013,Posted: 30 April,all,Red Eagle LXIX,"A pretty decent dungeon romp.Might not have the greatest replayability once beaten as from my current attempts on Rogue it seems each playthrough will be nearly the same.The pit traps affect the baddies as well as the player.  Always nice when such is the case in this kind of game as it does allow for more tactics.  I do wish some of the other traps worked on the baddies as well, but the pit traps were very useful.  Especially in Rogue mode to avoid Morph fights.Overall, one of the few to make it out of Early Access and be a good game.  Does what it says on the label and has been enjoyable.A lot of reading if you want to get into the backstory (not really necessary).I appreciate that the developer put the effort into detailing theories on magic and the planes of existence and how it relates to the game universe."

But an hour will only get you so far in this game. There is a lot to explore.  Which might I add is saying a lot for a game that was just released, and being developed by 3 people. For what it is I say it is worth the price."

There is plenty to explore and I got a few jump scares. The game’s combat is fun but still needs a little more work. There are a few things I’d like to see in the game though. Adding things in like blocking, voice acting, and a rogue mode would be nice. I’d also like to see faster player actions and more things to pick up. Otherwise the game is good especially for the price. Can’t wait to see more"

However, I am an old gamer and this game has no adjustment to make it easier for me to play.   I live for the story, exploration, and the fights.  Managing my resourses takes a back seat to the adventure.   It is early and with luck these nice developers will fix it a bit.  Exploring Castle Torgeath will have to wait till then.  You got a potential classic here guys, keep at it!!!"
,Recommended,431870,32907969,Posted: 27 June,all,The_Brickinator,Castle Torgeath is an interesting little dungeon game. Had fun playing with it mostly. It was an interesting adventure for what I played so far. I really enjoyed the surprises in the game as well as talking with npcs. There are some things I wish were done better like more RPG stuff but in general I'd say it was mostly good. Final score: 7/10
,Recommended,431870,26696195,"Posted: 19 November, 2016",all,Solitary Sentinel,"The game overall is pretty good, puts me into suspense while in game because you're not sure when a creature will come out and attack you, or the things you could find in any of the rooms. Also, the game has been improved a lot since the day I bought it, that means updates. Updates are a great thing in games like this ones, specially in early access. That shows that the developers are constantly looking forward on ways to improve the game as much as they can. Many of the diferences I noticed in a few updates where some of the scenes at the beggining of the story which were improved greatly, and some texture changes and additions so the game looks even more interactable. Finally, the game is good, still has a few details that should be covered but nothing too serious and I would recomend it to anyone."
76561198285735689,Recommended,431870,30738787,Posted: 25 March,all,MountDoom,"A great game for nostalgia and worth getting if you enjoyed the old dungeon adventure experience.Castle Torgeath harkens back to the olden days of dungeon rpgs such as Shadow Tower with the attempt to recreate that experience for more recent times, something the game does very well for people who remember or liked those kinds of games. Combat is somewhat slow at first and takes a bit getting used to but then becomes modestly enjoyable for at least a short while after. The story that I uncovered so far was fairly interesting although I wish more than just the npc dialogue was voice-acted, however it doesn’t really affect your ability to get into the game so long as you don’t mind pausing and reading for a bit here and there. The little I’ve seen of the rpg system is somewhat basic and bare-bones but it seems to get the job done if you really stack your points into one particular stat or another.  The game does a good job of keeping you in suspense and forcing you to consider whether it’s wise to engage a group of enemies for xp or not. I had my reservations for the strange monster types that seemed to randomly spawn after killing enemies sometimes, but the system ended up feeling exciting and interesting rather than frustrating so long as you kept your wits about you and roamed carefully most of the time. As it stands the game is fairly decent for what it is and is more than likely to satisfy that dungeon crawler itch if you’re the kind of guy who is into dungeon-themed games. More than anything else it was the low price point of the game that made me feel like it was very good for what it was. So with all that said I can resoundingly say the game definitely gets a positive recommendation from me.tl;dr: Game is pretty decent for the price especially if you're really into dungeon games."

The main problems i have, is there are too many bars to fill and not enough stuff to fill them. in my opinion its a good game on the right track but with a few tweaks it could be Awesome, a game i could play for hours :)."
,Recommended,431870,22396458,"Posted: 13 April, 2016",all,Mead Champion,"First of all, I'd like to mention that I like this game and I'm fascinated with medieval castles and dungeons, although I wouldn't want to be in the protagonist's shoes. :DIn fact, I've wanted to play such a game for many years. A creepy game that is set in a dungeon and where RPG elements are combined with survival elements.What I also like is that I control only one protagonist, I control him freely and directly and the movement is not grid-based, unlike other dungeon RPGs, many of which are party-based as well. I like it when I play as a single character.I haven't played a lot yet, but I'm willing to give feedback.What I really liked about this game:The price, of course.That the game is not overcrowded with enemies and doesn't focus on constant fights. As a result, the game is slow-paced and creepy. It's immersive. If the dungeons were full of monsters, it would ruin the atmosphere. It's better to have a small number of monsters that are dangerous and scary.That the dungeon is not so straightforward. There are passages and hallways that are not connected with each other and lead to separate areas.The availability of character customization options. I want my character to be unique.The overall idea and setting. An intriguing story, dark dungeon exploration, necessity to survive, frightening surroundings.The graphics, style and design. They're pretty old school and make the game even more gloomy. I especially liked the statues.The music is surprisingly fine. It was a good idea to use such ambient music as a main soundtrack in the castle. It helps to create a dark and haunting atmosphere that is essential for this type of game.What I'd like to be changed or improved. A few suggestions:The halls and rooms look empty at times. They could be embellished with paintings, weapon racks, furniture, some useful items etc. Anything that might be suitable.The ability to block enemy attacks and to strike with the torch. I'd like to have it.The way the protagonist holds the sword looks kinda weird and unnatural.The first NPC I met was weird too. He looked like a statue or a zombie. Maybe his position or animation could be changed to make it more realistic.I wish there was a sneak skill to avoid some hazardous enemies if the protagonist is not prepared to face them.I didn't notice any bows in the game. I saw a crossbow only. A variety of weapons would make the game more interesting.I would like to see a 'hardcore mode' where a player is able to save his progress either at certain 'checkpoints' or a limited number of times. I want the game to discourage a player from constant 'save/load-s' and from feeling safe in this castle. I want the game to force a player to survive. >:I'd like to see barrels and bottles of drinkable wine as an addition to other consumables. I didn't notice any. A medieval castle without wine? No way. See my current avatar. ;) It would also boost protagonist's bravery, something that he really lacks. :)Anyway, the concept of combining a dungeon RPG with survival elements and creepy atmosphere really appeals to me. The game has its peculiar charm.Update:I've just defeated the giant spider and proceeded to the next area. Wow, it was a disturbing adventure.I love it when these types of things appear in games. In combination with appropriate ambient music they often create a grim and hellish atmosphere.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=665138388http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=665138486In spite of enjoying the game, I feel a little uncomfortable while playing it and I feel sorry for the protagonist. It's due to the mentioned atmosphere of gloominess and despair. The developers managed to create it, well done. On the other hand, this type of game helps me to 'relax' and forget about everything after a busy day and daily routine.I wish I could light a fire here...http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=664623114...and drink a bottle of wine......to warm and cheer the protagonist up. ːsteammockingː"

Making the torch mandatory gets frustrating sometimes. I would much rather have a shield in that hand. Maybe have a light spell or something to give lumens.

And the first time you swing the sword you start with, you'll likely think ""ugh! soo slow!""...But don't judge a book by it's cover!Here is my ""First Play on Launch Day! (Early Access)"" video...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUzoP8xrafAStay patient with this game, and it will reward you, even on this first day of it's early access launch.This game offers creepy spiders galore, lots more baddies waiting to ruin your adventure, and while the A.I. is far from great and could use some work, it's still fun and will have you desperate to get your own hits in, especially when taking on multiple enemies at once!There are hidden traps everywhere, and keeping your eyes open and your torch lit are vital to your survival on this expedition to escape the castle once the doors you entered close shut for good on you!This game features multiple weapons to be found and used as you venture further into the crypts of the castle, and while you don't start with any kind of character creation or get to choose your class, you'll get to experience a little of every class if you can complete this game.As long as you don't go into this game expecting to play the next Skyrim, I think you'll be happy with the fun to be had in this indie RPG.  As it continues its development, I would expect it to only get better, and at $4.99 USD regular price, you could do a LOT worse with your money!There is NO procedural generation of loot, dungeon rooms, or mobs.  It's going to be the same game every time, but just finishing the game is the challenge. The developers say about ten hours is expected to beat the game, that equates to about 50 cents an hour.. which to me seems like a pretty good value, even if there really is no replayability.I give this game a recommend based mainly on a high value score and the fact that once you get past the old school graphics and slow combat, this game offers quite a bit of fun...Value:  36 out of 40Fun:  22 out of 30Controls & Bugs: 15 out of 20Graphics & Sound: 6 out of 10---------------------------------My total score on Day one of Early Access: 79%79% is not bad at all for a game that launches on sale at $3.74 USD that offers many hours of dungeon crawling gameplay and understanding the game will likely only get better as it goes through its early access development.This game gets my recommend to anyone who won't buy this game expecting it's gonna be the next Skyrim or Diablo AAA game.  While it could have better graphics, a faster combat, and better mob AI.. it still packs quite a lot of RPG adventure goodness for your gaming dollar!"

The game is simple but fun to navigate and if you're into an underground setting it feels pretty good. Being able to smash enemies with traps laid around the map always makes for a fun experience, at least it did for me xDOverall for being so cheap Castle Torgeath is a nice gem in the rough for fellow fans of dungeon crawlers."

,Not Recommended,431870,29182247,Posted: 11 January,all,CallmeNezo,"First i want to say that this game is a really good Dungeon crawler game. It has alot of things that i really like. But one thing that i feel is missing is the option to look at a map. Since many areas are so so big, then there are alot of hallways that look almost the same, many places look the same too. And i feel like when playing i'm going in circles many times, or are total lost. And the worst thing is that if you can't find you're way then you run into the problem with food, the food system is alright but when you are lost and can't find the way it becomes a bigger problem.If you like a good dungeon crawler game, buy the game. But keep in mind you are proplerly gonna waste alot of hours finding you're way."

Despite this, I've found it quite enjoyable, especially for its price tag. The combat is already quite fun, the game is quite intuitive, and it's one of the most atmospheric games I've touched all year. It hearkens back to the older dungeon crawlers, a genre in sore need of good new games. I honestly got the urge to pull out a pen and paper and begin mapping out a game for the first time in years! This game shows much promise, and I look forward to where it will go. If you have $5 to spare, I heartily recommend the game."

Great atmosphere with very quiet combat music that does not distract.  The mouse controls for fighting are very impressive… rolling the mouse wheel forward and backward performs different strikes with the equipped weapon.  When the equipped torch runs out and you try to make your way back to the last wall mounted torch to get a refill and a spider surprises you in the dark… great stuff!!!
