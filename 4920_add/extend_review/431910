,Not Recommended,431910,21106225,"Posted: 10 February, 2016",all,themoonrises,"It's a lot like Super Hexagon, but with up and down and the controls are constantly being inverted. If you hit an obstacle the timer and music and everything starts again, which is annoying because there seems to be only one music track. If I remember rightly Super Hexagon  had more, not just for the different difficulties but every couple of times you hit an obstacle the song would switch between one of a couple of tracks which made it feel a bit less repetive.  It's a lot less sleek than Super Hexagon and to be honest I only managed to play twenty minutes of this compared with several hours of that, partially because the music is purposefully awful, but there's only one track of it, partially because the control switching is irritating. Super Hexagon was stylish and insanely difficult, this just seems designed to annoy.I paid about seventy pence for this, that's about as much as a can of coke. Honestly I'm not sure there's enough here to justify it even costing that."
,Not Recommended,431910,24819559,"Posted: 10 August, 2016",all,"Notice Me, Sendai~","Okay the concept is interesting and the gameplay is nice, but here's the problem. It is SUPER hard, and it WILL NOT let you quit the game until you ""find the answer"", which i assume requires you to last a certain amount of time in this rainbow hell. Thing is, if you aren't all that good at it, not only is it frustrating, but the constantly changing rainbow lights may start to give you a headache. They may make you start to feel sick. And if you try to quit it asks you if youve found the answer. If you haven't it won't let you stop. It won't let you lie either. I had to go to the task manager and force shut the thing down just to make the headaches stop. Do not play this game if you are not good at it. If you are not good at it it will not let you go until you are. And the flashing lights, they never, never stop.Now if you could quit when you wanted to instead of being forced to watch nonstop flashing lights until you 'find the answer', maybe my review would be different. But as it is, no. I cannot recommend this game. This game gave me a migraine and made me feel sick, then refused to let me take a break when I needed to get away from the lights. This game is mean and inconsiderate and might even be actually dangerous to photosensitive people. Like I dont even have a problem with a few flashing lights and it had me about to throw up, I can't imagine how much worse it would be for someone who's sensitive to that kind of thing.So if you're thinking about it, don't. Just. Don't."

No matter now long you try, you'll never catch the dragon.  But the trying is worth it.The mechanics are simple but the game is very hard to master. Do not get this game if you get easily annoyed as the game seems unfair at times.This is the sort of game that you can start whenever you have some spare time to kill but beware it could easily turn into a ""one more try"" game.  You are not going to want to turn off the game and the game won't let you.Will you find the answer?"

My experience went as such:I got faster all the time. I felt the progress to keep going reaching out in front of me. Each door that seemed shut could be opened with the right reaction at the right time if I was fast enough. I'd form rules to follow if something felt unnatural. Meanwhile, I would be praticing; trying to teach my fingers what to do. Changing back and forth I'd stretch myself as far my luck, speed, and patience would take me.
