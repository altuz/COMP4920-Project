,Recommended,431960,30453222,Posted: 11 March,all,Laggel,"I have always hesitated to use live wallpaper applications since they used to be very performance-draining. When researching for perfomance-tests of ""Wallpaper Engine"" I didn't quite find a review that was useful for me so i decided to get the software and test it myself.It should be noted that this review will ignore other apsects such as the content of the software.Hardware Specs:CPU...............................i5 6400 (no overclock with BCLK)CPU cooler......................AIO watercooling loop from NZXTGPU...............................GTX 980TI (MSI - no manual overclock)RAM...............................16GB DDR4 (GSkill - 2133MHz - dual kit)Motherboard.....................ASUS ROG Maximus VIII RangerSSD................................Samsung 850 Evo (Only for OS, Steam and apps on HDD)OS..................................Windows 10 ProfessionalTest:The software (run in non 64-bit mode) will be tested in two scenarios. Arsenal wallpaper will be used for all tests.1) Hardware usage will be observed while the System sits idle for 10 minutes without any other applications running in the background. The tool for HW monitoring is ""OpenHardwareMonitor"". This testing scenario will be repeated for the wallpaper presets Low, Medium and High and a standard windows desktop background as reference.CPU temperatureCPU loadGPU temperatureGPU loadGPU memory usagePresetNoneLowMediumHighCPUTempAvg21°C20°C20°C20°CCPUTempMin18°C18°C18°C18°CCPUTempMax25°C22°C22°C23°CCPULoadAvg1%3%3%3%CPULoadMin0.4%0.4%0.1%0.4%CPULoadMax24%10%24%24%GPULoadAvg0.1%7%10%15%GPULoadMin0.1%1%1%2%GPULoadMax5%11%16%21%GPUTempAvg35°C36°C37°C37°CGPUTempMin34°C35°C36°C36°CGPUTempMax36°C37°C38°C38°CGPUMemoryUse180MB185MB230MB260MBFurthermore the RAM usage has been tested, but did not show measureable differences!Ram usage was always at about 2.2GB.2) This test will show the impact on gaming performance. Again, Arsenal wallpaper is used, this time on preset High. As there are different options to choose, which define how the wallpaper will react to an application being run in fullscreen (Keep Running, Stop, Pause) a benchmark will be done for every mode and as reference with a standard windows desktop background.I chose the Benchmark Scene from Rainbow Six Siege with the graphics on ultra preset. Here are the results:FPS in RB6-BenchmarkRB6SMinFPSAvgFPSMaxFPSNone102173327Stop93172264Pause100172296Keep Running58171299Conclusion:As we have been able to see, there are slight differences in terms of hardware usage. I was surprised that the software did much better than expected, but the results may differ, considering community-made wallpapers may use more resources. The CPU temperature values may not be very reliable due to the CPU being watercooled thus these values are at the very low end of the scale.Wallpaper Engine does also have an impact on gaming performance, which can be kept to a minimum using the ""Pause"" or ""Stop"" behaviour for fullscreen applications.With a hardware config as ""enthusiast"" as mine, i doubt that there will be serious performance issues with this application, but if you are gaming on a much weaker rig, i recommend turning down the settings of the live wallpapers a bit.At the end of the day, you will have to decide yourself wether you want to sacrifice resources for cool a$$ (a$$ can be taken literally) wallpapers or not.I do not regret my 4 bucks on this software and will be using it from now on."

,Recommended,431960,29064509,Posted: 6 January,all,冷水ひさし (9) .tw,"Although this application doesn't have any cutting-edge technologies or unforeseen ideas, I see a lot of potentials in this app as it is still in early access while it surprisingly fits my need (The magic of Steam workshop); however, I would still glad to see the devs implement more features to make this app more customizable depending on various scenarios and target audience.For example, being a anime-chuu and otaku like me, I have subscribed a bunch of anime openings, but it seems that I have no choice but configure them one by one manually. Thus, it'd be neat if this app provided a feature which allow us to group multiple Anime Openings (video-type themes) together by creating/editing playlists or something like that. (configs? profiles? tags?) Furthermore, once we choose a playlist, it'd shuffle it and play/apply each of themes in the list automatically, like the way that Windows's built-in function works. (Wallpaper Slideshow)PS. Just some random thoughts/suggestions that came to my mind. The devs have already done well so far. This app definitely worth paying for. (120 NTD)"

As of right now, it is not bad.However, the only thing I have to say is this…  First off, I do not hate anime and there are anime shows that I do like and/or enjoy watching.  But, I guarantee you that over half of the workshop’s content is anime related (it takes your at most two minutes to browse through the workshop and see what I am talking about).  I personally don’t like that a large chunk of the wallpapers on the workshop is some sort of (let’s be real) anime porn…  I prefer more nature centric or creative backgrounds.If you can get past that, this is an awesome concept that I hope gets continued to be worked on by the developer and fix the little bugs it has and maybe clean up the workshop of the anime spam.   I recommend that you try find backgrounds of the ocean waves with a beautiful sunset or even just nature centric backgrounds in general.

There is TONS of good non-anime related wallpapers. I personally have some space wallpapers (as I'm an astronomy lover) and some game wallpapers for games such as dark souls, witcher 3, etc. If you also feel that theres not enough wallpapers to your liking then you can even make your own! Wallpaper Engine provides you some tools to help you make your own wallpapers. If you have skills in coding (which I sure as hell don't because I ain't THAT smart lol) then they can be taken full advantage of with this software!As of the date of writing this review this game is still in early access so more content plans on being added in the future. So far I havent experienced any bugs with this software but I can't speak for others.Finally, one of the best parts of this software is that it puts little to no stress on your computer's performance! I'm running on an Intel Pentium G4560 @ 3.2ghz, 8gb DDR4 ram and an EVGA GTX 1050ti (not the most top of the line computer) and I have all the settings cranked to max and it literally puts no stress on my hardware, as a matter of fact just having steam open uses more of my hardware power than Wallpaper Engine itself displaying a moving wallpaper at 1080p 60fps! This software can run on 99% of computers no problem so don't worry about having low end hardware. Wallpaper Engine also pauses when you go fullscreen on anything like webpage or a game (you can disable it if you wish).Overall this is THE BEST software I have ever used on a computer. I'd HIGHLY recommend you pick it up right now! It's only $4 and the price will be raised (according to developer) once it leaves early access so hurry and buy it ASAP!10/10 Would downloadhentaimy favorite anime openings and game wallpapers again!TL:DR: You can get thousands of wallpapers of almost anything you can think of, as well as make and upload your own. It uses little to no power of your pc hardware and is convienent in nearly every category you might think. A must buy software for pretty much all people!"

But I even saw summer themes with snow falling. And nothing BUT the snow was animated.-You come across tons of Anime Openings or Simple Youtube Videos. Which I don't really get.

,Recommended,431960,26019997,"Posted: 13 October, 2016",all,Kabacus,"It's Early AccessThere are currently two levels to this software, casual use and advanced. I make the distinction as until some useful documentation is produced you will need to know a bit about masks, 3D modelling and such if you want to create 2D or 3D wallpaper of any complex nature. Even then I think you will still have lots of questions.For example, when creating a waterflow wallpaper the only hint at what is required to make the water flow is ""The red channel defines horizontal water flow, the green channel controls vertical water flow"" and there is an image with red arrows and green areas on it. I haven’t a clue how it works :( (but I will ask the question in the discussion group)But as I said this is still early access, I am sure either a guide or documentation will follow when the application is ready for full release.Casual UseThe supplied wallpaper is very good, as is a lot of the available wallpaper on the workshop. The application encourages you to upload your creations to the workshop so if you can’t find anything that suits your tastes at the moment I am sure it won’t be long until you do.One foible for myself though, I have a 21:9 monitor and rarely have apps in full screen (unless gaming), an animated wallpaper can get quite distracting and a lot of what is available is quite bright with high levels of contrast by default.The overhead seems quite minimal, mostly CPU runs at 1% or less for the exe and GPU utilisation (GTX 1070) was up to 40% utilisation for some of the 3D wallpaper, 15% for 2D and 6% or less for everything else. As promised the wallpaper does pause when full screen is activated for an app/game.The creation of web, flag and video wallpaper is a breeze and to be honest I was stunned with the ease of the creation and presentation of a video wallpaper. You can create some in-game footage using Shadowplay then immediately create a video wallpaper using that footage and have it looping on your desktop, flawlessly using less than 2% GPU on my rig!Advanced UseIf you are experienced in 3D modelling or (semi) advanced graphics I am sure you will have a ball creating wallpaper with this software. A quick look at the workshop demonstrates what is possible even at this stage of release. I only hope that some good guidance becomes available so that I can join in, I am sure it will.SummaryWhatever your level of expertise Wallpaper Engine will have something that you can use and will like. At its current price it is a steal and it can only improve."

I've had this running for weeks now, no problems whatsoever.Also, very few of the wallpapers seem to support 2 or more monitors. The various flag themes scale correctly, and look quite nice, but they're still half the resolution they should be.

If you're not that old, humour me anyway.  It was a grand age of desktops-to-impress, later snuffed out by Microsoft who decided that flat-and-plain was so much better...Not to worry: Wallpaper Engine brings animated desktops back!  It's been done before (Stardock's Object Desktop for example) but Wallpaper Engine is leaner and much more stable than any others I've tried, only sucking up around a quarter of the RAM used by Google, and just a little over that used by the Steam client (so it's quite small).  There are only a few wallpapers included, but that doesn't matter because there are some 36,000 ready-to-use wallpapers right there in Steam's Workshop (that'll keep you busy for ten minutes at least...), and it's also very easy to make your own with the application.  You'll find in the Workshop lots of game cuts and intro scenes that loop endlessly, with and without audio effects, anime, abstract, nature and all sorts of other stuff (you might find yourself wading through a LOT of anime to get to them though).The program supports all display resolutions, though if your screen, like mine, is larger than 1080p, some wallpapers will look a little soft because they were made for a lower resolution, so you might have a bit of trial-and-error in fishing out the good wallpapers from those thousands of uploads.  As with all Steam Workshop content, you simply subscribe to the ones you like in Steam, or delete, then unsubscribe to be rid of them (I expect there will be a few that horrify you enough to delete immediately)!  However, if you download a wallpaper and it happens to have a horrible audio track, a horrible theme colour or you're just a picky blighter like me, you can simply disable the audio or adjust the volume and you can change its colour scheme (the settings are remembered for each paper).Wallpaper Engine is a neat little program that can cheer up a dull, static desktop.  My life will be complete when someone reinvents animated icons to match.

Now at first (whilst the application was just springing in popularity) there wasn't much choice in workshop-content. It was only anime, anime and more anime. Since then however, the diversity in user-generated content has skyrocketed.If you are an advocate for desktop customization then this program (with Rainmeter) is a must."

,Recommended,431960,29683510,Posted: 3 February,all,ThatDarnOwl,Wallpaper Engine is a neat piece of software that replaces your wallpaper with a tweakable animated render.So far the functionality is pretty tip top. It supports optional audio playback features. It can start with windows when it turns on. It has tweakable settings related to things like anti aliasing. And different wallpapers are customizable. Ranging from the ability to change the color to the speed at which the animation plays.So far it's in Early Access but I've mostly been pretty satisfied so far with it. I'm interested to see where it goes in development. Since it is a very neat idea that I've only really seen on Linux operating systems and not so much on Windows.Whether a little bit of eye candy is worth your 5$ is up to you though. But for me having an animated wallpaper that displays soundbars for your music tickles an itch that my usually static wallpapers can't scratch.

But for the multi screen user you might experience some problem of finding fit wallpaper because NOT ALL OF PPL USE MULTISCREEN and this happened when you apply normal wallpaper on your multi screen the wallpaper did stretch to your monitor. it like you open 1920x1080 image and enlarge it to cover all screen.BUT THIS IS EARLY ACCESS like you all know (the review tag already mentioned it) the things might be improved.

Even Windows Vista, at a time, supported the concept natively. But what makes Wallpaper Engine revolutionary in my opinion is that it is the very first time this idea has finally been executed successfully.No program before has managed to ever make this great idea more than a gimmick. Programs before had limited support, it was impossible to find wallpapers, the UI was confusing and it was difficult to create custom backgrounds. In comparison, Wallpaper Engine, only being a few months old on Steam, already has thousands upon thousands of different background options available for free, and all easy to install with one click - just subscribe through the Workshop as you would any mod on Steam.Not only is there a breadth of backgrounds available, but the program also proves exceptional in its resource usage. Programs of past failed in this respect, as they'd clog valuable CPU and memory resources to keep the background going, which defeats the purpose of a background in the first place. Wallpaper Engine has none of those woes, and its resource footstep is nearly invisible.The idea of a program enabling users to have live, animated, and lush desktop backrgounds is not a new one, its decades old, but Wallpaper Engine is arguably the first to, at last, make it work."

( basically move the wallpaper along to the beat. Well I don't know how to rephrase it so plz forgive mah ;~;)3.

There is still support for it by the community (a lot of people are still making wallpapers)Cons:1. Wallpapers with Music can't play when u are in full screen :<, so you would have to either close full screen or no music (Now I can't listen to my nightcore .~., when I game)2. Too much anime wallpapers, ( I know that i listed it down as a good thing but that is if you liek anime. IF you don't, you would have a lesser range of wallpapers since 75% of the wallpapers are anime themed)3.

,Recommended,431960,30835221,Posted: 30 March,all,mighty hawk | TradeSkinsFast.com,"At first I was a bit skeptical. I thought that Wallpaper Engine really would destroy your RAM. Then I said ♥♥♥♥ it, and bought it. But after the purchase, I found out that it pauses whenever you open something else (with the exception of non-fullscreen/enlargened windows).Steam Worshop is what makes it worth it though. While it might be a bit dissapointing to see that most of the custom backgrounds are half-nude anime women, there are some good ones out there as well. As a big fan of The Witcher series, I was delighted to see multiple start menu backgrounds from the various Witcher 3 DLC.The fact that it's filled up with animated women also makes for a lot of fun with your friends. I bought it in school, and we definitely had a lot of fun with the explicit backgrounds. Uploading your own backgrounds is also possible (that sentence reeks of p0rn, I know). You can even get backgrounds withsound(again, sorry).ConclusionWallpaper Engine is a great source of fun and amazement, and for mere 4€, it's definitely worth it."

It has no more effect than watching a video in VLC or streaming on youtube. This software is beautiful, and the steam community backing it in the workshop is fantastic. Pick this up now! -PR0XIDIAN"

Wallpaper Engine turns your static desktop wallpaper into a moving work of art.  Featuring a bevy of customizable options for systems powerful and modest, a veritable gallery of high quality, gorgeous wallpapers, and a reasonable price, you'll replace your current background solution in an instant and never look back.The software comes with some basic wallpapers pre-installed, but with Steam Workshop support, you can already browse hundreds of nifty wallpapers made by the community, many of which are expertly made and really breathe new life into your desktop.  You can search through various categories such as video games, anime, animals, cartoons, and much more via the integrated, hassle-free Workshop.  You can search for popular wallpapers, top rated, most recent, and even more customized searches.  Just subscribe to something, download it, then click and test out your new wallpaper.  It's all very snappy and doesn't take any more effort than assigning a traditional wallpaper in Windows.There are multiple options for tweaking and enhancing your moving wallpapers, such as anti-aliasing options to make your background look as pristine as possible, FPS limits so they flow smooth or look more cinematic, even resolution controls and options to decide whether the wallpaper should keep animating in certain instances, like when playing a game in fullscreen or maximizing a window.  Some wallpapers feature sounds to compliment the scenery as well, though thankfully, the volume can be turned down or muted altogether.  It's all pretty light on system resources too, but just in case, toning things down still makes your wallpaper look incredible, just with a smaller resource footprint.  Even at 10 FPS, most wallpapers look spectacular while ensuring virtually no impact on system perfromance.As for the selection of wallpapers on hand, the Steam Workshop is constantly updated with jawdropping new animations by talented artists.  This software has become very popular on Steam, guaranteeing that fresh wallpapers will be added at a consistent basis to the Workshop.  All in all, the creator of this software should be very proud for implementing such a simple yet genius idea in such a polished and accessible way.  It really looks awe-inspiring, and you'll be hard-pressed to ever go back to a lifeless, static desktop background again after experiencing the cutting edge look of these animated wallpapers.  For its current price of $4 as well, this software feels like an essential addition and the logical next step in owning and personalizing a computer."

You can create animated wallpapers and for some reason put unity games in there too, but that's really where it ends. Which isn't a bad thing but if you're hoping for a little more you're not gonna find it.The tools are nice and easy to use, not having to siff through config files is nice and there's really not much else to say.Basically if you're willing to drop 5$ for animated wallpapers go for it, but if you're looking for something with a little more function I'd say go to/stick with rainmeter."

If yes then buy this right away.When I first heard of Wallpaper Engine, I had no idea what it even was. I had though it was just some cheap cash grab that just gave you stupid wallpapers. I was VERY WRONG.Wallpaper Engine Is well... Wallpapers, however it isn't your average everyday wallpapers, its LIVE, 3D, VIDEO, AND WEBSITE Wallpapers! I had overlooked this program until I saw a video showing off Wallpaper Engine, I was immediately interested and said screw it and bought it. (I haven't even thought about regretting it) Wallpaper Engine is one of the best things I've spent my money on in a long time, which is saying a lot considering it's a wallpaper program...I will admit the vanilla wallpapers aren't the best, however when you open the workshop, and filter out the Anime tag (or not), I can gaurantee you will find at least 10 wallpaper you immediately download!Pros: Easy interface, Easy to use, The ability to (In program) filter out certain tags on workshop items, Workshop support, Cool Devs, It will freeze the wallpaper when a program goes into fullscreen so it doesn't kill your fps while playing, Achievements, Steam Trading Cards, Its THIS good and it's still early access, Wallpapers, Memes, Gandalf, Gaben, Shia LaBeouf, Oh and more WallpapersCons: No Skeletor Wallpapers (Yet ;]), You can't delete any Vanilla Wallpapers, Your wallpaper can (Rarely in my case) crash, I felt bad for the cons because there were so little so I'm just writing a really long string of text because there were only 2 real cons that I found...My personal favorite Wallpaper is NVIDIA RGB, followed by Bacon ;)"

The setup is very simple, and you can assign different wallpapers for each monitor, something that Windows 10 removed from 8.1!

I have yet to work out the purpose - is that stuff supposed to titillate?

However, I can say this is the bestanimated wallpaper software I've used so far.  Though I would like to recommend one feature,please allow us to globally mute wallpapers (if this is already possible, please inform me as Ihave been unable to find such an option)!  Audio is not something I'm looking for in mydesktop wallpaper.  Also still relating to audio, the audiophile wallpaper that comes with theprogram doesn't work correctly for me when I turn on record audio.  Every time I play a soundit repeats an annoying sound at the end and the only way I can stop it is by unchecking recordaudio, which defeats the purpose of the visualizer.  That being said, when it comes to justhaving an animated wallpaper this software is amazing!  I used to use Dreamscene for myanimated wallpapers but this has most of the wallpapers I used then plus hundreds more.  Notto mention they are all displayed with much higher quality and usually at a solid 60 fps(Dreamscene always looked more faded and ran at around 30 fps).  tl;dr- if you want highquality animated wallpaper and don't want to bother with Dreamscene or you have an OS afterWindows 7, this is the software for you!Edit: reviews are hard to format properly on steam lol"

,Recommended,431960,29152509,Posted: 9 January,all,CrAzY,"Originally bought this to make a game wallpaper using Unity, but quickly found out that Keyboard input doesn't work for any wallpaper background, only the mouse. There is a way around this, but it basically will get my game wallpaper to be flagged as a key logger.Despite all of this sadness, this application is excellent, especially for being Early Access! I have no problems with it so far, besides the wallpaper pausing itself, although this happens very very rarely. [UPDATE: This no longer happens!] It boots up with Windows no problem and selects the appropriately selected wallpaper every time it restarts itself. Settings enable you to pause or stop the wallpaper completely if you are fullscreen or focused on another window, if you are worried about it hogging your PC's resources.I am excited to see this grow as well as see the Workshop explode with content.Funny that I have followed the creator since discovering his amazing abilities to modify Valve's Source Engine, so finally having a way to support him and use one of his creations is pretty awesome. Good luck with everything!Updated this to point out that the developer has been fixing problems and adding new features to this software on a regular basis. This thing is exploding! You can really tell he stepped it up to improve it because of this. Great job!"

You could be playing your favorite music video, have a cool-looking scene from your favorite show, or even an animated version of a previously stationery image you had for a wallpaper. The possibilities for what you can create and use for your wallpapers are endless.

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

But you need to know the following limits/problems:Steam will constantly display that you're using the program even if you're just running it in the background for the wallpaper, this forms a problem due to friends that think you're ignoring them because steam says youre using this program. That automatically makes it look like you're at you computer.This program also causes problems when running a family library, if you're using the program just for the wallpaper and a family member would like to play a game from the family library they can't because steam sees this software as a game being played for some reason.I'd recommend it to fool around and show off, but not for permanent use."

You get access to a massive variety of incredible creations from the devs and the community. Backgrounds have amazing customization and I love it. I especially love the ""Raindrops With Audio Vizualizer"" background by DillieDing, as it is absolutely amazing. and I highly recommend you check it out. This is the type of app that leaves you speachless every time you boot up a new background, and almost makes me feel bad for hiding the beautiful wallpaper with my game. Though all this is great, I must give a word of warning that there is A LOT of anime for some reason. Search anything and you get at least 5 anime results.

It gives you the posebility to set animated ""web programs"" and more.For exampel, you can have a thing were watterrippels will follow your mouse movements. OR you could have a video that is playing on loop. There are alot of supercool things. I recomend the ""4k audio visualizers"".

You can surf the web without leaving your desktop now. And yes, that includes porn, for those affectionados. :PA big thank you to the community trying their best to come up with original web and application wallpapers (interactive 3d particle playground, simple audio visualizer and raindrops are a must-have).I read some of the negative reviews and was skeptical about buying this, mainly because I thought I wouldn't find something that suited my taste. Don't be. By the way this is growing it won't take long before they up the prices.2.79£=3.some$ IT'S DEFO WORTH IT!Only cons: (My experience only)- Audio responsive wallpapers are only working if I have my mic set as the sound input. I recon'd the steam community, restarted the computer and all but the audio from my speakers is not recognized.- 1 too many little anime girl wallpapers (You can choose to opt these out when searching so it isn't a real issue, just a comment)This is actually my first review on steam. I hope it helps you decide."

So I decide to stick with the same old boring wall paper , intill I found this baby.  not only was it 4 buck but it allowed me to set up custom wallpapers both static and animated! and didnt rely on a another site to suck up your wallet.Instead it relyed on the steam workshop(which to be fair its mostly filled with anime crap).Finally you are allowed to make your own wallpapers."

So if you aren't into that type of stuff you might wanna stray away from this for now... Not saying there isn't non anime related live wallpapers but the amount of anime wallpapers easily destroy the rest.

,Recommended,431960,29347753,Posted: 18 January,all,LeMador [TH],"i get that the developer has to make sure that the 'Wallpaper Engine"" works without any serious issues.. but it does feel like a finished product already.. and i had no issues running this Early-Access on my i3-2120 with GeForce GXT640Ti..i used Stardock's ""DeskScapes"" for over 2 years..'Deskscapes' has a good number of animated wallpapers, but when i saw what the ""Wallpaper-Engine"" can do.. i was blown away like a young kid trapped in a toy-store alone all night..i am browsing the workshop for hours non-stop and i am still discovering new things to add to my collection of animated wallpapers..- what makes the 'Wallpaper Engine' a winner is the workshop..the software's official animated wallpapers are too conservative compared what people share on Steam workshop.. FORGET ABOUT the video posted by the developer on Store Page.. go to youtube, and if you search for 'wallpaper engine' on youtube, make sure that you watch videos that are posted by people from Asian countries (China, Japan, Thailand, the Philippins etc), they'll show you the variety of what this software can do..while most English speaking videos do not do enough justice to what this software can do..by comparison..'DeskScapes' from Stardock has stunning official animated wallpapers, but the community website (the equivalant of Steam Workshop) has very few good animated wallpapers that were made by fans..'Deskscapes' always felt to have few good choices..but on 'Wallpaper Engine', i am struggling to choose which animated wallpaper to be on.. there are so many good choices to choose from..- the length.. some shared wallpapers on 'Wallpaper Engine's workshop, are 7-10 minutes long before wallpaper gets repeated; that's more than enough for music-videos, trailers and short films..  compared to 'Deskscapes' animated wallpapers that rarely go above 20 seconds before they are repeated, like a Gif animation..- what i hope to see in the future updates of 'Wallpaper Engine"", is the ability to tweak the wallpaper more.. for example, 'Deskscapes' has the ability to invert a wallpaper vertically or horizontally, and apply filters like black&white, darkening and old-film.. i for one, prefer to make my wallpapers darker, so i can better read the lables on my desktop icons..and other features like the ability to automatically cycle between selected wallpapers with a shuffle option..- at the moment, this  Early-Access is about US$3.00 compared to Stardock's Deskscapes which is standing at US$10.00..and i cannot emphasize more on the fact that the Steam Workshop is what makes the Wallpaper Engine great..in conclusion..this is a great software and a great addition to my collection..but you have to remember that this is an Early Access, and they are still trying to iron-out the kinks in it..so make sure you read the system requirements for the app, and 'how to fix common incompatibility issues' that is posted in the 'Discussion' before buying..5 out of 5"

Like i am at a loss for words, i took a shot in the dark and bought this seeing how it does everything stardock deskcapes does at a much cheaper price. I didnt expect it to be so good. The sheer amount of work put into this program is top notch and there is massive support from the community through the steam workshop which has literally thousands of animated wallpapers created by its user base. You will never be bored or run out of new animated wallpapers thats for sure! The program barely eats any resources at all and doesnt affect your PC's performance. If you open a game it automatically pauses in the background as to not slow down your games which is a very nice feature. At the price of $4 you cant go wrong here, I still cant believe this is an early access app either, it feels very polished. BUY IT!!! the reviews are overwhelmingly positive for a reason. This will change the way you view your PC forever.Q: Does it support multiple monitors?:A: YES! The app also supports multiple monitors, which means you can span all the wallpapers on dual or even triple screens, which looks amazing!.Q: Can you edit the wallpapers?A: Yes the majority of the wallpapers can be customized, such as the color and size.Q: How much resources does the app use?A: The app uses about 2% of the CPU resources (on my i5-4670k)Q: Do they react to your music?A: Yes! some of them do, you can filter wallpapers in the workshop for music support."

With a non-intense background, now I am getting 50-60 fps (which is how it runs without wallpaper engine :)2 .The dev responded very quickly, so brownie points.  He stated that it might be caused by a recording program (I use the NVIDIA overlay) so I thought, that might be it, but it turned out it was just the background."

,Recommended,431960,31014493,Posted: 8 April,all,¡★Zerafalgar,"What is there to say?It's a software that does its job, and it does it well.You can either create your own animated wallpaper, use one of the preset ones, or browse Steam workshop for downloading  any wallpaper. Creating one can be just as easy as recording a part of a video/game, saving it, and then using it as a wallpaper through this engine.Don't worry about the performance drops, I'm using this on a low-tier laptop and I've never noticed any performance drop at  all, no matter what I was doing. It must be so minor if I follow the logic that there should be some performance drop because those still are animated wallpapers, but really so minor that one won't notice at all.You can also change the wallpaper motion speed and add music to the wallpapers.I have nothing more to say, if you want to try creating your own motion-ed wallpaper, using some part of a video or just have a really cool game momment recorded that you want it to be a wallpaper. This engine is for you. If you're not as creative with own stuff, don't worry, the workshop is filled with a lot of creative ideas too, most of them being for anime fans, but you can also find high-res game captures such as Sovngarde sky from Skyrim (that is what I'm currently using), or a lot of other things, really, once you  have this engine, the next to limitless choice is just up to you.There is nothing else I can really review, as I said, this software does its job, and it does it well."

Regardless of choosen wallpaper it will make your gpu and memory clocks go 100%, which then makes the fans spin. I didnt buy a gpu with 0 fan rpm mode to make my wallpaper screw up my silence.- Vast majority of wallpapers run at whatever framerate and speed they want, completely ignoring powersaving options of the software.- Doesn't support ultrawide really. The few wallpapers that do are pretty much exclusively from overwatch (for some reason ?) The rest are just zoomed in which reduces their quality.- Makes discord/steam detect it as a game without ability of disabling it.- There are wallpapers as big as 2GB. I mean really who wants their system to load n keep in memory 2gb wallpaper?- 20% of wallpapers have music (WHO THE HELL WANTS THEIR WALLPAPER TO PLAY THE SAME SONG ON REPEAT!?)- 20% of wallpapers are cheap and easy cuts from movies at terrible quality- 20% of wallpapers are ACTUAL anime intros/outros (which tend to be busy). Seriosuly. . . . wtf- 20% of wallpapers are flat wallpapers with snow effect of sorts- 15% of wallpapers dont actualy let you disable music and/or are simply AMV stolen from youtube.

,Recommended,431960,30860391,Posted: 31 March,all,[PG] Gimff,"Now, I'm not entirely certain how to review a piece of software of this nature, however I shall try.Short and sweet? It's good and is worth your money. I shall provide a detail synopsis below.What is it?Wallpaper Engine is a great tool which allows you to have detailed animated wallpapers which often have interactions and are incredibly versatile, many playing music if you so wish it. These wallpapers come from the plethora of community created artworks on the steam store, all compatible through WE (Wallpaper Engine). WE also allows you to tinker with your own artworks and upload them for the world to use.Yes, I am aware there are free alternatives to this (and so should you be), however none do it as stylishly as WE, nor are any as convenient to use.The software is stable, and has support for multi-monitor setups, allowing individual allocation of wallpapers per monitor, or for stretched panoramic artwork. I have not experienced much issue with the software stability wise. WE does what it claims to do, and it does it well. It also does not have a high impact on system performance, I say this from the perspective of running WE on a very mid-tier PC.Is it worth your hard earned cash?Well that depends on you of course. Is an animated, and potentially interactable wallpaper something you feel intrigued by, and something that you feel you could appreciate? If so, yes, WE is well worth the asking price. If wallpapers are something you have never bothered with, or if having an animated wallpaper is not something you feel you would appreciate, than of course WE is not software you should be purchasing.At the end of the day, WE is a very well made piece of software which delivers on it's promises and then some, and in my mind is worth the small asking fee and more.Post script: Yes, there is a large quantity of ""anime themed"" wallpapers on the workshop, however that is by no means to say that there are only ""anime themed"" wallpapers. From my experience, there is a little something for everyone here."

I have an i7 3.2ghz (old series from 2008) and it has 0.25% usage on typical wallpaper at 30FPS. Depends on the wallpaper. Process is suspended when not animating (full screen or maximized window) for 0% usage. RAM usage is about 100MB per.+ Don't need Steam to have it running or start.+ Frequent updates.+ Large selection on the workshop with ability to make your own or use a video file.+/- You need to be a shader programmer to make complex, high fidelity, low resource usage wallpapers. There's no scripting language or anything (probably why it runs so well). Video (mp4) backgrounds run acceptably well though (~1% of a 6600k @ stock).

You can select/search local files to activate (or workshop files that have been downloaded) and you can browse/search the workshop directly inside the app to subscribe and download it. Within main UI you can also make 'playlist' similar to when you queue MP3s on Winamp/Foobar/Spotify. Overall the UI is pretty basic but it gets the jobs done.When pulling data from Steam workshop, the performance overall is impacted if the file being downloaded is big e.g: video wallpaper around 700 MB. It takes as much as 80% of my harddrive alone. Understandable though, but it does affect the app's own performance if it's playing video + music as it causes stutters. People with more powerful rig and notably SSD prolly won't see this performance hit.The software is smart enough to detect if there's full screen app active - so it stops its operation, and there are options to adjust so your performance loss when using the software in the background is suppressed. The biggest performance hit comes when you play high resolution video (1080p/60fps). If I use it, it causes a big performance drop for my laptop. Switching to other app as full screen app instantly stutters everything for a second, and if the video background has music attached, it also freezes a bit. Thankfully for a normal live wallpaper, I can use it just fine with no noticeable performance drop.As for the workshop itself - which I deem as the main strength of this app as crowd-sourcing app contents still surpasses developer's contents in terms of richness - , you can select from many styles of videos or live wallpapers. There are thousands materials to select from already, and growing, making the selection pool pretty large. You can use an in-app editor to make your own and upload it for free, or monetize it if the users give you approval (like Steam's Greenlight system).Honestly I can do nothing but recommending the app. It's cheap, has crowd contents, allows you to upload your own creation and really I've had fun tinkering so even the experience alone is well worth the money. Just be wary if you use a toaster like me, don't have too high of an expectation.8.5/10 - please improve the UI, developer."

I couldn't end the program properly, so forced 6 running instances closed which brought CPU usage to 33% when it should have been about 13%, yet still bogged down the system horribly until restart.  Seems to be a leak or duplication issue that is eating up resources.  Until that is fixed I cannot recommend the engine.Edit: I have a triple monitor setup, so 6 instances of the program running wasn't insanely over the top as it seems to designate a seperate process for each screen."

This one... Sure it is!As you can understand what the heck is this software from it is name, Wallpaper Engine is obviusly a Wallpaper software. It has dual monitor support (couldn't try triple but I am pretty sure It'd work fine) and you can create wallpapers, share them on Steam Workshop or you could download them on Steam Workshop for free. User created wallpapers always rocks. I found many game related animated/video wallpapers with music in the background and they look neat in 4K.Did I create any wallpapers? Of course no. Sadly not. I don't think that I can handle it. So, I can't comment on creating wallpapers but as what i see, it looks quite user friendly and nice. I bought this software to -only and only- download wallpapers from workshop. It's well worth it. Wallpaper Engine's workshop is huge and you can almost find everything, even maybe request them on the forum. (Anime and any other Asian created wallpaper included, be warned :D)PS : You can close Wallpaper Engine at anytime on Steam, it runs on the background. It's no harm to system (at least mine does not use much Ram etc.)You have to start Wallpaper Engine from steam when you restart your PC or shut it down. (Idk if there is another way)And, Wallpaper Engine is easy to use. Has some great options which is setting FPS etc. (I set mine wallpaper to 30 FPS, works fine. 60 could make your pc overwhelmed)"

76561198142562617,Recommended,431960,30911120,Posted: 2 April,all,A🅱️ion,"CS:GO is a highly competitive skill-based game. This is what makes it so great, learning the maps, all of the different tactics, improving your aim and managing the economy. This however, can be a long grind. Every map has its own calls, grenade spots to learn and positions to play.CS:GO runs great(although every updates costs FPS), has some good sound design, and decent graphics for an older game. Updates come regularly to add stuff and valve keeps improving the game. A big downside of CS:GO however is the big amount of cheaters. If you don't link your phone number to the game and play in ""prime-matchmaking"" the game can be literally unplayable. This can be very frustrating, especially when you're doing your best to rank up and improve.Aim and sound play an important role in CS:GO, More than in most other shooters. every gun has it's own recoil pattern to learn and it's own unique playstyle. Since CS:GO requires alot more tactics than most other shooters, aim is more important aswell. Having your crosshair at the right position means you can take your opponent down alot faster. Alot of practice, and playing aim maps helps and using your sound to locate your enemy's footsteps gives you a big advantage. The CS:GO Esports scene is also massive, milions of people follow it and it's a great place to learn. Use this to your advantage. Wanna know those new tactics, boosts and smoke/flashes? Watch some games! You can honestly learn alot from watching the pro's play.Now ofcourse, you saw this one coming, the community can be really... annoying. Especially at lower ranks the community is full of toxic kids, people who have no idea what they are doing and teammates who refuse to work together. This can be harsh, especially because CS:GO heavily relies on teamwork. Thats why i recommend playing this game with friends, and practicing alot. The faster you're out of those low ranks the better! Once you get a bit higher you'll see the community gets better and better(with the occasional toxic/clueless player ofcourse). People work together, people give usefull information and are just a bit more nice in general.Next to competitive, CS:GO also has some gamemodes for people who just want to have some fun and don't care about ranks or tactics. Gamemmodes like: Gun-Game, Team Deathmatch and Casual are great for this and the thousands of community servers offer cool things like: Surfing, Aim training, roleplay, minigames and more!Now would i recommend CS:GO? Yea ofcourse! Especially for the small amount of money it costs. Just dont expect this to be another casual shooter. It's a highly skilled game and requires you to put in alot of time to improve. Pick this up with a couple of friends so there is less chance to be matched with annoying teammates."

Quite a few desktop backgrounds are in different languages but often it is obvious which buttons to press and quite often not necessary. You can have this boot on startup if wanted. The only downside is with some moving backgrounds, the RAM usage will go to extraordinary amounts, so either you can have a very good computer, or simply use the mode I do which will pause the animation when you're not viewing the desktop. Overall a very good software."

76561198003811382,Recommended,431960,30085229,Posted: 21 February,all,Azza ☠,"The product itself is a bargain for it's price tag and a nice way to bingo out your desktop or give it additional effects/features.Performance wise, it's mostly good for all, but depends on what you use. I personally get 1% or 3% CPU usage on all, except for a few really bad ones which can go up to 17% (but just avoid those). Disk usage is low and memory usage is fine too. It can also auto-stop the wallpaper animations while playing a full screen game, etc. So no worries there.If you have application control or quality anti-virus scanner which monitors your Operation System, ensure you allow this app to be trusted and not blocked. Else it could lag or cause many issues around security access. My virus scanner is very restrictive of allowing apps access to modify the Windows desktop and monitor audio, etc. However, after setting to trusted this works fine.  Also, the vulnerability scan came back clean and pretty secure (access to audio, network, etc - depending on what you are using).Suggest you make your Windows wallpaper (under Control Panel or right-click Wallpaper > Personalize) to be just a solid black color. There's no point loading in this wallpaper, with another going to be placed on top. It will stop it from flickering between them too, when first just loading up Windows, for that split second before the Wallpaper Engine had loaded.The purchase wallpaper items are probably not worth it, but there's a few good freebees, specially gaming ones I personally like.

,Recommended,431960,26162669,"Posted: 22 October, 2016",all,Scottx125,"Wallpaper Engine is a fantastic piece of software, which allows you to display 4 types of wallpapers for your desktop, these backgrounds can be as follows:- Scene : Basic wallpaper, can be animated.- Video : Video wallpaper, in most cases looped to seem animated, can also have sound.- Application : Run an application (such as a basic game) as your wallpaper.- Web Application : Run a web based application as your wallpaper.Now as many of you may be thinking, a lot of these formats can be fairly intensive on your GPU and CPU, however on my specs (albeit fairly good, check my profile for them) I have not noticed any lag. And performance on my favorite wallpaper which is a looped video of a log fire, only uses 3% CPU and 2% GPU capacity. In any case when you are on your desktop and have nothign significant to run, using up clock cycles to run a nice background isn't going to bother you that much. And if you are worried about the background impacting performance in games, do not worry! There are an array of options within the engine to mean you only really have to open Wallpaper Engine when you want to change wallpaper, the options within this menu allow you to set the wallpaper you choose to launch on computer startup, to pause when not in view to save system resources, change the volume for backgrounds (if it has any sound) and so much more.Still now convinced? Below is a short list of the Pro's and Con's of Wallpaper Engine.Pro's:- Cheap.- Do not have to buy DLC, can get LOADS of wallpapers from the workshop.- No noticeable performance impact.- Lots of settings to reduce system usage, and individual wallpaper settings.- Developer is extremely active with the community and regularly patches bugs (were a few at launch, but were all patched within first couple of weeks, works perfectly now).Con's:- Workshop is now full of anime..Final rating 10/10, great piece of software with even greater potential."

There are lots of wallpapers/videos to choose from in the Workshop.BUT...There's way too many anime wallpapers.  It's a weeb's wet dream. Even anime fans will probably think there's just too much.  I haven't found too many wallpapers I really like yet.My biggest complaint with Wallpaper Engine is that there doesn't seem to be any way to randomly cycle wallpapers after a set amount of time. So that means you're stuck watching the same video or wallpaper endlessly until you manually change it.  I just prefer to use Windows' personalization and use my own photos as wallpaper, and have them randomly change every 10 minutes.Another minor complaint is there doesn't seem to be an option to disable sound by default.  If I load a wallpaper with sound, it plays when I load it. If I turn the sound off, then load another wallpaper, the sound will play with the new one.  I'd like to disable sound universally by default so I don't need to manually turn it off each time.I probably won't end up using this too much, but I don't regret the 4 bucks I spent on it.  It's a neat program that's worth messing around with for awhile."

Thus, it'd be neat if this app provided a feature which allow us to group multiple Anime Openings (video-type themes) together by creating/editing playlists or something like that. (configs? profiles? tags?) Furthermore, once we choose a playlist, it'd shuffle it and play/apply each of themes in the list automatically, like the way that Windows's built-in function works. (Wallpaper Slideshow)PS. Just some random thoughts/suggestions that came to my mind. The devs have already done well so far. This app definitely worth paying for."

This program is either for people who already know several coding languages or those who want to download work from them.I simply wanted to add audio responsive effects to go with my own wallpapers with no interest for the workshop or the bad few wallpapers coming with the program itself and there is simply nothing to do that yet it's what one would expect the most from this program in the first place. Also I asked about this in the forums and i received no answer from the devs or anyone.And I noticed that the base wallpapers coming with the program themselves are messed up. For example the D.N.A. one is meant to be displayed with a task bar located in the bottom of the screen ; mine is on top so I could see that the bottom of that wallpaper is actually an ugly neat line of its ""background"" without the blurry foreground.

All I have been able to do was download some poor backgrounds from the steam workshop, none of which (there are only 100-200 btw) cought my eye. You even have to launch it every time you start your computer, or else the background you chose won't load in. This is just an annmoying thing that seems so obvious to fix, but hasen't been. I am not even able to return it or even launch it from steam. I wish I had been told that beforehand, because I have no reason to use this, and would have returned it if i could."

Overwhelming number of the wallpapers offered are plain rips of youtube videos, static images with babby's first after-effects or just good old softporn of Japanese childrens cartoons of children for children. Good stuff, senpai.Notice that all of those things can already be done by means which don't cost a dime. So what are you paying for? The privilege of spending hours to make your favorite dynamic wallpaper? Of sorting through endless reddit-tier trash? Having mom freak upon seeing your animated moe wallpaper and call the priest to exorcise the pædodevil from your sexy tubby bod?It's not worth the money until they commission or produce some works which realise the whole potential or at the very least some kind of QA service.

It's just that the content that exists is made in a kinda half♥♥♥♥♥way and a lot of it is just plain bad and ridiculous. Again, not all of it.I found maybe...5 wallpaper I actually liked (weren't anime, just to meniton )  and were genuinely cool and not just some clip that was thrown on the screen, but actualy effort that someone put in making the content that I expected from this. Like a cool and pleasant solar system, which was nice. Or some space-like energy floating around.Also to mention that the creation of your own wallpaper doesn't work. Or at least I haven't figured out how it works. Having to ""launch"" the program everytime you wanna open it is annoying.Those who put effort in their work, those 60 fps, smooth wallpapers - nice.

,Not Recommended,431960,33410526,Posted: 9 July,all,Alexou,"I have three monitors in my setup. To be able to game on a three screen display a certain configuration is required. In this configuration, the computer sees the three monitors as a single monitor. Which means that when I open the wallpaper engine, I don't have the option to put one different wallpaper per monitor. So what happens is that I can only put one wallpaper, and the majority of the wallpapers available are for a single screen... So the wallpaper gets all stretched up...To fix this problem I would have to enable my three screen gaming configuration only when I want to play games, and has soon as I leave my game I would have to remove that configuration... It just doesn't make any sense... And to enable/disable this configuration I would have to close all running applications and turn them back on afterwards...What could be good is, to be able to choose from where to where do we want the wallpaper to stretch. As I said, my computer considers my three monitor as a single widescreen monitor with a resolution of 5760x1080. What could be nice is to be able to chose for example : to have one wallpaper of a 1920x1080 resolution aligned on the left side (left screen), to have another wallpaper of a 1920x1080 resolution aligned on the center (middle screen) and another one to the right side (right screen).I recommend this for people who have a standard resolution monitor (not a widescreen monitor), for people who have a multi monitor setup (not for gaming).

Some wallpapers have little adjustment possibilities (speed, color, sound, etc), which you can tinker with.Keep in mind that this is still in early access mode. So little bugs can arise.

I'd prefer a slightly smoother transition, ie Fade from one to the other.- When you have a muted video as your background, switching playback devices for your sound makes the video's audio start playing again.

Considering what it does, it uses suprisingly little computer resources to run.The only con is the lack of variety of the wallpapers available, they're not bad but there's too much of the same style, the workshop seems mostly anime focued, but with a little playing around it is easy to turn a video into a background. I have a feeling that there is a lot more to it that I am unaware of but hopefully I might stumble across some relevant information on how to make some better custom backgrounds one day.I hope this software continues to grow because it is the most stable program of its style that actually does what it's meant to do without having to be a technical genius & it is cheap, unlike some other programs I have come across that make the clams of customization but fall flat, especially with the Windows 10 OS & tend tp cost a crap load more in comparison to Wallpaper Engine."

Plus, it's obvious a huge portion of the creative force of the users enjoy that content, so I may be in the minority with such an opinion - I can't give an app a bad review because the playerbase doesn't allign with my creative desires.There are plenty of awesome wallpapers to be found, so even with that little rant I 100% support this application and would definitely suggest buying it.

The Workshop's categorization leaves a lot to be desired.They also REALLY need to demand, as REQUIRED, that creators upload an animated preview of their wallpaper before they're allowed to be accepted into the workshop, as some of these ludicrously size up to 1gb or larger, and most of them don't show you what they do unless you actually download them.Another is some of these walls have extreme CPU load with multiple processes cropping up, and even though my CPU is relatively old at this point (AMD Phenom2 x4 955), 50% usage is bloody outlandish.But I'm thinking it's likely an issue on the uploader's side with wallpaper streamlining than the software since a plethora of others run a single process at about 2%, if even. Can't be entirely certain.All in all, I'm surprised this works as well as it does. MY DESKTOP, IT LIVES."

,Recommended,431960,32042378,Posted: 29 May,all,Honey Badger,"Anyone who saw the other, negative review and is confused:""Hold on, Badger, what the hell, your review was negative before, you were tearing the software a new one, complaining about the anime's and butts and how there were too many of those!"" Yeah, well...I still don't like that, but something happened, i'll tell you what happened:The developer told me how much of an idiot i am (Note: he didn't tell me that, but i'm sure he would), because i wasn't using the IN-BUILT FILTERING WITHIN THE SOFTWARE, because all that time i had been using valves one, which doesn't have a filtering software, so i messed around with the new filtering in the software and...It works. Beautifully.The best part is i'm sure atleast one person was trying to tell me this, but hey, I didn't know.Okay, now that THAT's out of the way, i can start this review anew.Wallpaper Engine, the name, and the pictures do not lie, ladies and gentlemen, this software replaces your wallpaper with animated wallpapers, be it giant clocks, soundwaves that react to your music, or hell, just some memes, why not, hell as i type this i've got ""Are you ready for a miracle?"" with gaben's steam summer sale on in the background.Now, I think some of you want an explanation, why is the software so great? Why should i spend my money on this? What was that spoiler in the start about!?Does Gaben withold half life 3 from the masses to build massive hype!?All those questions, except the last one, shall be answered.Why is wallpaper engine great anyway?Simple:You have animated (or static) wallpapers, and surprisngly this really doesn't kill your computer, unless it's a potato from the 1980's or something, no system should have trouble running this thing, I would've thought this thing would eat up all my RAM usage, but hell I don't really have a problem with this. I can use my computer for days with this thing running and it's not any slower than the day i booted it up.Why does this software deserve my money?Nothing deserves your money dude, just saying.Well, quite simply, it's bloody animated wallpapers, and not just one, but hundreds, THOUSANDS of them, all catagorised, I will say right now:Are you an anime fan? Yes? GET THIS PRODUCT MAN, YOU'RE GONNA BE IN HEAVEN.Are you an overwatch fan? We have tons of duplicates of your stuff, help us.Do you love watching waves hop around fraticly as music is blasting? We've got plenty of that!How about videos? GO RIGHT AHEAD.You want some games on that background? We literally have a section dedicated to games.How about medieval? You want some guy in armour stand with the words ""DEUS VULT"" slamming you down? WE GOT IT BOYS AND GIRLS. NOW YOU TOO CAN GO ON CRUSADES AGAINST JERUSALUM.Anyway, besides that, you can find what you need within the following catagories:- Abstract- Animal- Anime- Cartoon- CGI- Cyberpunk- Fantasy- Game- Landscape- Medieval- MMD (Miku Miku Dance i believe it's called?)- Music- Nature- Pixel art- Relaxing- Retro- Sci-Fi- Technology- Televison- VehicleAnd - Unspecified genreThat's right everyone who owns this product, i just went through the entire workshop to post all that.Now i can't say if more will be added, probably, probably not, but that's all we have, and remember there's HUNDREDS, if not,THOUSANDSof these wallpapers in each catagory. So there is never a shortageWhat's that? You want too make your own wallpaper or you feel there IS a shortage?WELL COME RIGHT HERE SON, I'LL SHOW YOU A MAGICAL WORLD CALLED CREATE YOUR OWN WALLPAPERThat's right, this software has it all, displaying animated wallpapers, and you can create them as well, there's even video tutorials for this. Personally i haven't used it. I have a terrible imagination.BUT THERE YOU GO, YOU CAN MAKE WALLPAPERS.Is that it? Final notes?YES.I need to stress this urgently, and i mean, if you don't follow it, you're gonna seriously hate yourself when you find out a later date.The game has an inbuilt filtering and searching system, i recommend this, because valves searching system on the workshop, does NOT have a filtering system, or atleast, it may as well not be there, because otherwise you're gonna turn into the negative version of me, see picture here(http://imgur.com/a/XP6sJ)of why I turned into hitler himself (And gained the popularity of about 57 people out of 85 (67%) about the fact i hated the workshop)But seriously, use the inbuilt search and filtering system, you'll have a better time with that than valves.I recommend it."

Most of the fun is because of the community it self and the workshop contents. they deserev the credits.secondly, most of the workshop content is full of anime pictures or trailers and if you are not the biggest fun i would recommend the contets made with unity. they are the most fun part of this.another good feature that i like about this is that if you have multiple screens you can put a wide wallpaper fitting on both screens or chose different ones for each screen.in general, they are still on the early access so not much to say yet if you have a low specs pc then dont buy this software. it is not for you. you wont be enjoying your slow running pc."

It's quite easy to learn how to make it work, and there's so much content already availiable. It is quite evident that if you don't like anime, then much of the community work won't be to your taste. On the other hand, most good community work have lots of customization options to make your wallpaper yours. Although this does slow my slow computer down slightly, its not noticable with the reccomended settings."

I felt like I had to add in to the chorus of positive reviews. When I bought this I expected it to be slightly gimicky, or like maybe I'd find a few good images and the rest would kinda just end up being low quality, but so far 20 pages into the work shop and over 100 wallpapers downloaded I'm blow away at the number of actually HIGH quality ones.My system is a bit beefier than most with an overclocked 7600k and a 1060 6gb but it still only runs at about 2-5% usage on both of those which is honestly amazing compared to some of the other systems I've tried that cost more and have less content."

I was blown away.Several days later, I'm still gloating. On monitor 1 (where I seldom see desktop cos I'm playing games), I have wonder woman with this amazing flow of particles on her sword. Yeah, I did see her sword, once.On the second monitor, mortal kombat.You'll love this app. It is so worth every penny that you'll pay for it, no matter the price. It has a search function, with links to every type of background you could want, from semi anime NSFW softcore to Supermans' first flight in Man of Steel as a video.

It is easy in use because of the simple and straigt UI, its widely customizeable and shows a lot of potential to improve what is already there and to add many extra features.Don't expect a very great variety in ready-to-use wallpapers though, because this program -and mainly the Steam Workshop of it- is completely infested to the core with weebs. For every decent searchresult, there are at least 10 crappy anime-versions of it. If you want that great wallpaper, be prepared to spend a lot of time looking for it while wading waist-deep in anime trash.I suppose that will fade out as the software gains more popularity.

My favorite feature is the video wallpapers where you can play videos or gifs on your background.Pros-Very wide variety of backgrounds to download.-Very easy to use. I have never been very good with programs like this but this one is very easy and simple to use.-Very easy to run. I have a potato and I was questioning if I could run this but I can run it at high settings very easily.-Good price. This is definitly worth $3.99.Cons-If your checking out the steam workshop 90% of the projects are anime and weeb stuff.-There are a few bugs like when you PC goes to sleep it will glitch and freeze. (Simple fix just close it with task manager)-It is pretty hard to make your own video or 3D backgrounds if you dont know what your doing.

76561198021701955,Recommended,431960,31861196,Posted: 20 May,all,GSValhalla,"For what it is and how much it costs, Wallpaper Engine is probably going to be one of those things that'll be almost a must buy for a lot of people. Now for some it may silly to buy basically just a wallpaper app. But for me it is well worth the money. What you get is an app where you can create your own wallpaper (with guides on steam to help new people) and/or download other people's creations from the steam workshop. What impresses me is that you can get really good high quality gifs, videos, 3d images as well as your usual 2d wallpapers.The downside for some people is that a lot of these are anime type or anime related wallpapers, which not everyone is into. However, if you are happy to search around you'll also find a good amount of gaming wallpapers as well as other things. For example, I found a Starcraft 2 wallpaper in the workshop from where the single player campiagn menu is from the Planet Charr and loops with all the sound effects of the guns firing etc. Another good example is The One Ring from Lord Of The Rings being on a table with the words on the ring slowly glowing and fading with the soundtrack to the movies playing in the background. Of course you may not want the sound from the wallpaper playing, but you do have options to turn sound off when you have other things on fullscreen for example or can just turn it off altogether.Overall, its cheap, fun to look through other people's creations, can create your own stuff and seemingly high quality."

76561198006898791,Recommended,431960,29910012,Posted: 13 February,all,Inspiration,"Best £2.79 you could ever spend.I've always been into my desktop wallpapers and would easily spend hours just filtering through websites searching for ones I like to add to my folder collection. Somehow, randomly while browsing through steam this came up on my page and thought for the low price of a sandwich I'd check it out.Once I bought it, I found the default animated/video wallpaper library list to be exciting at first, but you easily get bored of the gimmick after a few minutes of browsing and trying them out.The thing that makes this truely special, and worth the money is their workshop support for people to post, create and upload their creations. Don't get me wrong the base game allows you to create your own, but the fact is, there's plenty of talented and imaginitive people out there prepared to put in the hours to create amazing wallpapers for people to enjoy.This is why I can't recommend this software enough, there are so many amazing wallpapers out there thanks to people sharing their creations on workshop, it makes the small price they're asking for this so worth it.I really enjoy the exciting range of wallpapers from the workshop list. If this didn't include workshop support, I could maybe praise the software since they charge such a low price. However, with the workshop support, it's amazing.I feel like this software is a true gem, not sure if there's others like this, but definately worth checking out, so much so that I even wrote a review for this and I never write reviews as you can tell from my 100+ products but no reviews.There are improvements to be made though, one of them being the multiple monitor support for playlists. This software allows a playlist feature to put all your favourite wallpapers in a rotating list either random or in order. However, if you run multiple monitors there is no automatic feature that puts them in sync so you can have the playlist playing for both monitors and rotating through wallpapers at the same time. What it does do, is allow the user to have a playlist for each monitor but in no way does it allow the user to have the same playlist playing for both at the same time.Another thing I have noticed is after certain wallpapers I've added through the workshop, they seem to freeze randomly. I can't put this at the fault of the software itself. But it is something to keep a eye on if your adding workshop content and noticed it freezing now and again. My solution would be to unsubscribe and see which wallpaper is causing your list to mess up."

It loads the current selected wallpaper pretty much instantly. (it can take a couple of seconds on my v. low spec laptop, but anything over about 3ghz should be near instant).Also can be run without steam once installed, so steam won't need to be set to run at startup.No icon in taskbar either, just a discreet windows looking icon in the hidden icons tab that can be used to access the customisaton panel. Have seen no loss in performance while gaming, seems to be about as heavy as having chrome open.Exellent clean UI and easy to use.Only negative is some of the wallpapers on the workshop are quite large, and so subscribing to around 5 or so can easily take about 1GB of space, but that's not really a problem for most people.Best £3 I've ever spent."

You are no longer confined to keeping your desktop wallpaper as a static image. Instead you may use videos and apps in order to customize the wallpaper however you want. If you are a fan of an image, but want to add particles, the app allows you to add those as well. The community currently has a lot of anime wallpapers, which may not appeal to all, however the engine makes it easy to create whatever wallpaper you want.Recommendations:-I recommend having a picture editor such aspaint.netor photoshop in order to layer your wallpaper so that it looks the way you want it to.-I recommend having Unity if you want to develop apps for your background-I recommend getting inspiration from what other people produced, either from the steam workshop or youtube.

You see, sometimes some wallpapaers have audio, you do not have control over the audio in the main settings, you can only control the audio via that wallpapers setting with a slider, there is no ""mute"" checkbox. The wallpaper may pause or stop when running software maximized or full-screen, and sometimes, when it pauses and resumes, it blasts the audio full volume even if you have your slider all the way down. Scaring the crap out of you and being extremely frustrating. You must slide the volume up and down once again, but eventually it will blast full volume again, best fix is i've found so far is to disable the wallpaper engine all together... Shame..."

,Recommended,431960,31479432,Posted: 30 April,all,RAOH,"ESCAPEMy stepfather always hated me. When my mother married him and he moved into our house, my life became a living hell. He found fault with every little thing I did and was constantly shouting at me and calling me names. In his eyes, I could never do anything right.Pretty soon, all of the chaos at home began to affect my schoolwork. I found it impossible to study and my grades started slipping. At the dinner table, I was so nervous that I hardly ate a thing. I gradually withdrew into myself and stopped hanging around with my friends.Things began to grow worse and worse. I became my stepfather’s punching bag. He started beating me at the slightest excuse. He was a strong man and I was too small to fight him off. Each punch and kick he delivered hurt me emotionally as well as physically. It wasn’t long before I was diagnosed with depression and the doctors put me on medication.Through all this, my mother stood by and refused to intervene. She chose her new husband over me. That hurt me more than anything else. I gave up hope and prayed for the day when I could escape.One day, I couldn’t take it anymore and ran away from home. I made it as far as the city, when the police found me and brought me home. When they took me back to my house, my stepfather was standing at the door waiting for me. His face was twisted in anger and rage.As soon as the police left, he turned to me and said, “Did you think you could escape?”That night, he beat me twice as bad as before. I cried myself to sleep. After that, the violence escalated. Every evening when he came home from work, I tried to avoid him, but it was no use. He began inventing excuses to beat me. I never understood how anyone could be so mean and cruel. It seemed like it was all a big game to him. Each time he hit me, I could see how much he was enjoying it. My body was covered in bruises and it hurt to breathe.Eventually, he went too far. One evening, he beat me so badly that I couldn’t move. I just lay on the floor of my bedroom, staring at the ceiling. I didn’t know it at the time, but I was bleeding internally. My mother begged him to bring me to hospital, but he just ingored her. He said I was faking it. During the night, I lay on the floor of my bedroom, moaning in pain and slowly slipping into unconsciousness. The next morning, my mother came in to check on me, but by then, I was already dead.Time passed…I don’t know how much time passed…Suddenly, I saw a bright light.I heard a voice announce, “It’s a healthy baby boy!”I started crying loudly.Slowly, ever so slowly, I opened my eyes.A man and a woman were staring at me.They were smiling from ear to ear.The man leaned down and touched my cheek.In a gentle voice, he said, “Did you think you could escape?”.btw nice app"

There are hundreds of custom wallpapers to choose from, some animated, some not. The animations are very fluent and run from what I see, at 60FPS, with the ability to rock music and sound effects when needed. 1 bad thing that I have noticed with this is that my ping in games/group chat channels (eg: Discord) drops a bit, though this may have no correlation to the wallpapers, further testing will be put in to this by me later.Music capabilitiesAnother fun feature with this software is that you can have music with your dose of animated wallpapers. The music is clear, and has no stutters. A brilliant implementation that i dont really have to say more about.Overall, a really great software, and nothing really negative from it. 9/10"

First of all it doesn't take a big toll on your pc, the wallpaper you create will have as much affect on your pc as having a page of crome open. Second it looks goddamn sexy. Thirdly, though you don't get alot of different options from what is already in the application, but that is why we have the workshop. So yea... reccomended."

They were either difficult to use or used too many resources or had some other sort of problem. Based on past expriences with things like this, I'm suprised how well wallpaper engine works. The UI is clean and easy to quickly understand without too much work. I basically tried to stress the program to see at what point it slows down and honestly I don't think I'll ever get to that point. With a i5-4690k @ 4GHz and 12GB of ram I tested the following. Max settings which were 60 fps (the max currently) x8 MSAA, full resolution, post processing, reflections, and the video loaded in memory. I found a pretty big wallpaper to test it that was about 1300MB and it runs without any problems. CPU usage for me was usually <5% at that configuration. Obviously that sort of wallpaper took up a considerable chunck of ram but that typically isn't a problem with most modern pcs. Pretty great program for a few bucks."

Yes there are a lot of anime wallpaper and I like my wallpaper to be landscapes, which I have had no trouble finding. (though, yes some of them I guess could be considered anime landscapes but I feel they were talking more about the anime girls).  The other thing is I don't know what kind of bugs or crashing they could be talking about, the only 'issue' I've had is that some wallpapers aren't set up to work well with verticle monitors (I have one horizontal and one vertical, which I'm pretty sure nobody else does, but AS EXPECTED stretching a wallpaper between the two monitors doesn't work that great (some of them are ok though), but using two different wallpapers is fine), and like I said it seems some themes weren't configured with vertical monitors in mind and the alignment is off, but some themes look just fine on a vertical monitor (IT could also be it was expecting multiple vertical monitors to work as one screen)"

I have to say wallpaper engine is one of my top 3 favorite programs because of how versatile it is. Its easy to get a great looking wallpaper setup or just download one from the workshop. About the workshop if your not an anime fan remember there are filters mmk? Past that there are nature pictures, audio visualizers, web apps, fireworks shows, animals, unity applications for amazing particle effects(I recommend if your using unity to pickup the ultimate VFX pack by Mirza) a little work goes a long way with that one)use HDR!Also if your a fan of Rainmeter this is a great way to make it even better, or make this better. They work well together. I sound like a sales person lol. Anyway your just here for pros and cons right? Ill get onto that nowPROS-Easy-Workshop is full of great wallpapers-Good with Rainmeter-VersatileCONS-Some wallpapers take alot of CPU(like 20-40% of my 6600K)-So much anime, it needs a bit more diversity-Time played is inaccurate, i must have 300 hours on this but it says.....*checks time played* 80.1 as of writing thisOverallThis is a great piece of software if your interested i totally recommend it.

One thing that I thought that would be a problem was that the wallpapers would consume a lot of the system but actually it consumes almost nothing. and while gaming or using something in full screen the wallpaper stops so it doesn't consume your system."

Even after having the same settings on each monitor for wallpaper rotations the monitors would end up with different wallpapers.Another thing is how the Workshop for this app is filled with anime-related wallpapers. This is either good or bad depending on who you are.The app is in early access right now so I can't wait to see how much is added when there's a full release. Despite the issue(s) above I would highly recommend getting Wallpaper Engine.

And spent hours in looking for that animated screen of meteors falling onto the planet, or Jeeves rotating sh*t on a blue screen?Check.This is not God's gift to wallpapers, but it honestly saves hours of googling, and if wherever on Earth there is a boffin with your tastes (and there is because come on, we are millions) who has created the wp you were looking for, BINGO you have it.Warhammer 40k flag? Check. Habsburg imperial flag? Check. Mass Effect 3 meteors raining sh*t on the planet? Check.Cons:1) every decent wp soaks up at least 100 Mb HD space, and yes, often they are screen captures of, say, Mass Effect 3 (have I said it?), Witcher 3, and other menu screens. Without text, at least.2) Manga, Anime, a lot of it – but you know already, and you can scroll down can't you?3) The usual horrible user-created cr*p, obviously.Buy it, 3 EUR and you save chunks of life looking for wallpapers. It's a KILLER APPLICATION, you will never need to tinker with system files to have an animated wp. Just get it and pick something decent, or test your mettle by creating original content (I will NEVER try, but it's possible).PS I am using it a lot. Steam says I've been using it for a few minutes, but this is because the program launches it at boot, and then you don't need to access Steam to benefit from it.GO. BUY. THIS. LITTLE. CRITTER.

This program lets you quickly and easily customize your desktop wallpaper(s) or simply choose from thousands of ready to go wallpapers from the Steam workshop. It allows for regular static picture wallpapers, full-on animated video wallpapers, and even app wallpapers. Wallpapers may also use music so things like music videos, episode intros and relaxing ambient pieces are all fully supported. You can make your own  custom wallpapers with any picture or video on your computer, or on the web, or if you're really talented you can give the app wallpaper a try. Upload your wallpapers to the workshop and share with others, change playback rate and sound volume for each wallpaper individually and quickly switch between all the wallpapers in your library.There should be something for everyone here, and if there aren't already tons of wallpapers that catch your eye, the program comes with easy to understand tutorials for all the supported wallpaper types, so anyone can make a working wallpaper that they truly love in minutes.I strongly recommend this program! It's listed as early access so it may or may not recieve even more features in the future. Give it a try, it is definitely worth the low asking price!"

It has many features that make it powerful enough for any user but still simple enough to use. It strikes a perfect balance between options and user friendlyness. The option to make your own wallpapers is it's strongest element. While Wallpaper Engine is very solid when it comes to options, there is no choice to purchase a multi-PC license. Attempting to run it on multiple computers at the same time causes issues with Steam and it's licensing. Having an option to purcahse a second license on one account is one feature that should be added. Overall it is well worth the money and I would recommend it to anyone who want's a more intersting windows experience."

Flexible and easy.Let's start with positive sides:+ No heavy impact on RAM+ Now you got animated wallpapers+ Animated wallpapers with SOUND+ You can even paste a whole season of your favorite show as an wallpaper+ A lot of steam workshop wallpapers+ You can make your own wallpapers from Video/Scene/Animated GIF/Web+ Cheap price+ Works even when steam is off+ Flexible with custom settings as FPS change/color/sound volume/ and many more+ Sound is muted and your wallpaper is paused when you use browser/play games/ etc+ Program is always updated and improved+ Web games as wallpaperNegative sides:- It wasn't released faster. We needed this program for years.- Some wallpapers have bad loop- From time to time you will get errors(Fun side - for 512 errors you will get achievement )- Some wallpapers got music that you wouldn't like(you can fix it with making your own wallpaper or find same without any music or turn sound down for that specific wallpaper)- Some wallpapers aren't FULL HD (but majority are even 4k)In conclusion:If you want a fully customized, with low impact on RAM, flexible and easy to use wallpaper program. Than Wallpaper Engine is what you need.You will get thousand of wallpapers from steam workshop. At any moment you can make your own. You can even make/use web games/unity games as wallpaper and play them on your desktop at any given moment.Thanks to this program using my PC became even more fun with unique wallpapers.So if you have spare money and you want to customize your desktop even more and better than before, don't wait any longer and buy Wallpaper Engine."

,Recommended,431960,29913776,Posted: 13 February,all,140.15,"About a year ago, I was looking for a simple (and cheap) way to use animated backrounds after seeing someone on the internet showing off their desktop with sweet animated pixel art as their backround.You'd think it'd be simple to do so by now, but the only free programs I could find at the time were rather junky and not that easy to set up, so I figured it's not worth the effort and gave up on the idea.So I was very happy when I found out about this program, which is not only cheap, but as easy to use and straightforward as changing backrounds through windows, as well as not too heavy on the resources. As I was getting tired of looking at static backrounds after all these years and windows versions this program is pretty much a life changer :DOne little problem (if you're not a fan) is that there is an overabundance of anime at the workshop that seeps through every category. So before I went ahead and bought this app, I made sure to do some digging to see if there were enough non anime wallpapers in there to justify my purchase. For me, there were (and I found that sweet pixel art as well!) but by reading some of the other reviews, that may not be the case for everyone.So before you buy WE, you might want to check the workshop first and see if you're happy with the current selection of wallpapers, especially if you're not interested in making your own."

Anything from waifus, anime intros and whole music videos (We Are Number One ofc)  to amazing space landscapes and visual sound equalizers will become a part of your desktop.The best thing about this? Its not resource intensive and as soon as you launch a fullscreen program you can pause it or even stop the animation all together in order to free up RAM.

This app runs as a software, and not completely through Steam, meaning you can have your desktop, yet it wont interfere with other steam apps or games. The live wallpapers really do bring your desktop to life, and the Audio Responsive wallpapers are pretty cool if you can get the right colors. There are a couple of really good Audio Resonsive wallpapers on the workshop, and you can change them in many ways, and set different backgrounds behind the audio visualization.

So now you can get creative, or just steal someone else's creativity.•Uses low resources.Cons:•Choosing the perfect background is hard. You'll find yourself distracted for hours choosing the right one. Its not really a flaw with the game but this wouldn't be very full without it being said.•The workshop is full of weeaboo crap. If you had facerig, you would have had this problem too, as it is everywhere and is just clutter to the workshop. Seaching for cars? Nope. We have anime instead. Searching for scenery? (No pun intended)Anime.•The stock backgrounds get pretty old pretty quick, but I dont know why you would buy it and use the stock backgrounds exclusivly.Theres probably not much else to say about, not that much other people are saying anything new, because its  either ""its cool"", ""I like anime"" or ""Its cheap""Summary (and/or) TL;DR:Its great.

The program can be selected to start on the launch of your computer, or through the software section in your library.Keep in mind, Wallpaper Engine's main strengths play in through the workshop and its neverending supply ofHentaibeautiful images and imaginative designs. Of course the default pictures aren't bad, the workshop holds the best you can find.On a last note, its also important to mention that some backgrounds make music. There is an option to freeze the frame of the background when it is not visible, for reasons as to not eat fps when playing a game.I would advise anyone with a few extra dollars to get this program as it is truly worth its price."

It has to be doing something right for a lot of people.Overall a very good product, and very reasonably priced.

But the only thing I don't like about this is that even when I set it to stop when fullscreen games are running, it drastically affects performance in games, such as CSGO. I normally get 400-600fps, but then when Wallpaper Engine is on, it drops all the way down to 100 and it gets almost unplayable for me. I wouldn't be complaining if it were only the fps as I don't have a 144hz monitor, but it somehow messes up my DPI and I can't do anything.I have it in my library, but it's currently uninstalled for now. Definitely going to install it again after some optimization updates."

76561198136445943,Recommended,431960,32203081,Posted: 5 June,all,Galileo007,"The trailers don't do this program justice.Wallpaper Engine is a program that lets you use custom-made moving backgrounds for your computer. These include videos, things animated in the Unity game engine, or even simple games themselves. All of this can easily run in the background of your PC with little to no performance loss.It's biggest feature is it's Workshop compatibility, which means that setting up a new background is a simple is finding one you like in the workshop, and hitting the download button. Now it will appear with your other available backgrounds within the program's menu. You have tens of thousands of wallpapers at your disposal, and almost all of them are free.The program has no noticeable performance loss. Using video-based backgrounds (not ones rendered in real time by unity, such as desktop background games) you will only see 1%-2% CPU usage at most. But how will this make my games perform? Worry not gamer, Wallpaper engine AUTOMATICALLY stops moving backgrounds when a fullscreen application is opened on that monitor, so your performance is untouched.The pros:-No performance hit on most gaming PC's.-Huge library of wallpapers.-Well made, polished, and easy-to-use UI.-Performance settings options, as well as nice settings for the active wallpaper. Most notably a volume control, which is extremely helpful.-At the time of writing less than $5.Because nothing is perfect; the cons:-No 4K support unless you have windows 10.-When using a single background for multiple displays, it will pause the background on all monitors when a window is maximized on one. This is a little annoying with two or three monitors because fullscreening anything will pause all your displays.-The included scene wallpapers are really lame. They are replaced fast by users with ones more interesting.My only serious complaint:-There are bad performance issues on Windows 7. Not effecting the entire system, but the desktop feels sluggish and slow, visibly running at less than 15 FPS. Dragging and tearing. I don't know if others experienced this, or if it was just an issue on my system. Newer OS running the same hardware worked far better.TL;DR:This is an amazing program, with good features and an even better price. Infinitely expandable due to the Steam Workshop. No performance drawbacks, and almost no bugs. Solid 9/10.But do note, this program was made with Windows 10 in mind, and you will see the best performance and support on it."

The only complain I have is to preview a wallpaper from the workshop, you need to download it, then if you dont like it you have to unsubscribe. A preview option would be nice.Also,  One more thing: it doesnt have a profiile option, so if you want to change your wallpapers you have to do it manually which can be annoying at times, but not too out of the way, the interface makes switching easy enough where its not a hassle."

,Recommended,431960,33867787,Posted: 28 July,all,Knight Radiant,"One year ago, I tried to replicate The Last Of Us theme using only rainmeter. When I finished it, I realized it was using so much resources, yet it was not animated, and startup was taking way too much time. Also the music started after everything else loaded, so it ruined the immersion. And today, with the same rig, thanks to Wallpaper Engine, I have achieved near perfection. It is 1080p, it is animated and the music is looped and starts first.  I use rainmeter only for two skins, and startup time is the same as if like I don't use Wallpaper Engine and it never lags.I cannot recommend this software enough, it is a true piece of beauty.TL;DR; Replicated the theme only using rainmeter, ate a lot of resources, used Wallpaper Engine, no lag. Best software 10/10"

Now there's so much you can do with Wallpaper Engine whether you just want to pick a background, mess with a backgrounds settings, or make a background of your own, Wallpaper Engine delivers.Rainmeter is always a free option but it is much less user friendly.

It's a great product that is well worth the already cheap price. Anime fans will be especially pleased with the user created wallpapers.Wallpaper Engine is a very nice application for any PC user. The ability to have a desktop background that is moving is just amazing. If you are looking for a good wallpaper for a laptop, desktop, a dual monitor setup, or a flatscreen TV; there are plenty of great user submitted wallpapers to choose from. If you aren't a fan of Anime; there is a filter function. Wallpaper Engine features several kinds of moving desktop backgrounds...~ A video file; great for when you want to have an AMV or a nice meme video.~ A 'Scene'; basically either a still 2D image with layered effects; or a 3D one. (Most user uploads are 2D)~ A 'Web App'; it's usually a game or some kind of application that is being run as a background.This is a great application to have for any PC user; anybody can make their own wallpaper with the editor!"

,Recommended,431960,34055239,Posted: 6 August,all,SimplyBallistic,"My friend gave me a cracked version of this awhile ago so I could try it out, but the moment I started using it, I hurried to steam to buy it before the prices went up. This program is amazing, fluid and fast. There are some crashes here and there, but mostly, it is stable and fast. It launches immideatly on boot with no delay whatsoever and is wonderful to see when I start my PC.The wallpapers are creative and editable which truly makes the expierence yours.My only complaints are:- Most wallpapers are ruined with dual screen setups which sucks. There is no support in the workshop for multi screen wallpapers-  There isn't too much of an abundancy of wallpapers in the workshop. It takes time to find a wallpaper that appeals to youOther than that, I high recommend this software!"

To make active wallpapers work natively, you have to do some weird registry hacks and whatnot. Not with this.Only problem is, sometimes it'll run away with your GPU, even if you lower the settings. Right now I got just a simple video background going, and my GPU fans started to ramp up after leaving a game, and now the GPU is at 75C just idling. If I remove the wallpaper, the temps go back down, but turn the wallpaper back on, temps go up. And I have a well ventilated system.Regardless, still a great application that really doesn't use any resources (unless you tell it to or the wallpaper you choose says it will)."

The community will keep this program alive and the 4$ id honestly pay 5 or maybe 8$.Keep up the works devs to me this is a finished product no complaints.

This app is created for my type of personality because I like anime and there a so much wallpapers it will take all my life to try them all out. This app is created for people who are to lazy to make their own wallpapers or search them in google. Of course we have to mention that some of the wallpapers move and are so lively. And if I'm not wrong this the first app with wallpapers on PC or just on steam.My rating for this app will be 10/10 because I don't really know could be better than this program.

If you`re playing this and dont have the animations paused this will cause so much lag and RAM usage its insane. But this is more useful if you have 2+ monitors, otherwise its basically useless, unless you stare at your monitor and just watch the animations then be my guest and buy this. But this is a must get for anyone that uses more than one monitor. Also if you use a 1650 by 1050 or less, search for those for the best looking picture.

Mine is the glow + Spark effect from Battlefield 4.If you want your background to be Nvidia, search Nvidia, if you want it to be a car spinning around, search car, or something similar. Its only 99% anime if there is no filter set.With regards to performance, it uses about 8% CPU and an extra 40mb of memory (Based on I7-4790K + 16GB RAM).

I'm impressed with how light weight it is. A great choice of many different animated wallpapers for you to use. A great feature is the animation pauses if you open a full screen application, so it doesn't use your CPU at all while playing games! You can also customize many of the wallpapers even further by editing colors, speed, etc. The program itself is also highly customizable so even if you don't have a very powerful computer, you can still run it just fine. Highy recommended for anyone who is bored of static wallpapers."
