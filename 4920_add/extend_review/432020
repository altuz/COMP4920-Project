Sorry, but this is a really poor attempt at a comedy game using basic cookie clicker like mechanics with a slight twist, if you want a game like this try 'Shower with your dad sim'. Much better, cheaper, has some actual gameplay, doesn't hurt your wrist.Edit: Yo, speaking mainly to the dev here but also to everyone else. This review is an honest opinion from my time played, I've got such a short playtime because I wasn't at all compelled to play the game beyond the time I played, it became frustrating and monotonous incredibly quickly. I bought the game to do a review off of it and it was inexpensive anyway. Not some critic just giving my 2 cents on a game I bought with the intention of sharing my opinions on it.Thanks."

,Not Recommended,432020,20373388,"Posted: 7 January, 2016",all,The Horror Network | Embalmer,"To be blunt, What's Under Your Blanket is nothing more than a tongue-in-cheek jerk off simulator with terrible Paint quality graphics.The game is comprised of five levels, and five sub-levels. During the main five levels, your objective is to play with ""what's under your blanket"" while avoiding getting caught, setting your blanket on fire, and breaking your bed. You must achieve your goal within two minutes by quickly clicking on your blanket to fill up your jerk-o-meter. The faster you click without interruption, the higher your multiplier climbs. The higher your multiplier climbs, the faster your jerk-o-meter fills.Every now and then a family member, or special guest for the current level that you are on, will interrupt you. If you get caught, or set your blanket on fire from jerking... I mean clicking too fast, it's back to the beginning of the entire game for you. I might also mention here that there is no save function, and no pause menu. The escape key will also immediately close your entire game.The five sub-levels are simple arm wrestling competitions, and barely favor a mention whatsoever. They're thrown into the game for filling the void of an otherwise empty game. Just click away until you finally win.Don't get me wrong. I had a laugh my first playthrough of What's Under Your Blanket. However, when I revisited the game for a second time to clean up the achievements I missed the first time, due to the fact that they were broken upon the launch of the game and have only been recently patched, the humor was gone and I was bored... stiff. *badum tsh*Truly, games such as this are destined to end up on places such as Newgrounds... but Steam? It's hard to fathom that this title made it to the actual store front. I know that I'm not helping to keep trash like this off of Steam since I actually purchased this title, but I do hope that games such as this and Shower With Your Dad Simulator are one-offs, and not a sign of things to come.Rating:1.0/5.0- It's Bad.The Horror NetworkCurator|GroupClick for Gore"

The gameplay is pretty bad as well. I did get bored of the game before the timer on that two minute clock was over.This game is an obvious cash grab. Even as a free mobile game, it still wouldn't be appealing. It's better off as a game in a free online site, but even then it would probably get terrible ratings. Although this game is currently voted as ""very positive"". I can view them as either joke posts or people who enjoy playing terrible games.

That is not the case either, you stop clicking while in bed when you hear footsteps, wait for the head to disappear, then go close the door not slam the door in the person's face. Being caught in your underwear even though your not doing anything is also a game over.If the cat comes in, you may think you need to chase it out the room with it running around and running away from you. No, just get close to it and click on it, I wasted a lot of time trying to chase it out.Besides that, the game doesn't seem anything special and fits more newgrounds for free than even 80p.

This game doesn't just suck, its aggressively not fun. You click on your blanket to fill up a bar, and you HAVE to click rapidly so you can do so before a 2 minute timer goes down. All the while various people attempt to go out of their way to catch you doing stuff in your bed. In addition, if you click too fast, you either break your bed or catch fire. Get a game over for any reason? You have to start over from the beginning. Hit escape to pause the game for a break? Start over from the beginning. Without splitting hairs, the creator of this game made an awful, painful, visually terrible game. And what little point there was for the game existing goes away shortly before early onset carpal tunnel kicks in: Ha ha. It looks like your fondling yourself. But that doesn't mean you can charge money for a less fun, asinine version of Cookie Clicker. Do NOT buy this game. Not even for a dollar or for whatever discounted price you saw. It's not worth it. Under your Blanket is not worth anyones time or money."

,Not Recommended,432020,20387443,"Posted: 7 January, 2016",all,Apoch Weiss | Apochs.net,"What’s Under Your Blanket?! is the debut Steam outing for One Game Studio, a development team or one-man operation I can’t find anything else about on-line anywhere. It was slapped on the Steam Greenlight program, and received enough votes to be released on that digital marketplace surprisingly quick. However, much like the recently released Shower With Your Dad Simulator 2015: Do You Still Shower With Your Dad title, this one also comes with a decent amount of controversy, ranging between how this service is allowing this type of game to exist to how sexualized the content is and how it can be observed by both children and those easily offended by it. But is there really anything more to this one than just a one-joke gimmick about masturbation, or is there more to this title than meets the eye?Yes, What’s Under Your Blanket?! is literally a male masturbation “simulator” at best. You’re placed in one of five “different” scenarios, all with the same goal of reaching climax. Most of the settings take place in your house, but there is a hospital and a gym to break up the monotony of the similar settings, as well as various interruptions per specific level such as a cat you have to chase out, your grandfather, a nurse, a trainer, and Santa himself. Next to the simple concept are the overly basic controls of spamming the left mouse button on your character to commance pleasuring yourself, stopping when someone approaches, then using the W, A, S, and D keys to run around after people who have walked in, or to close the door for privacy. Keep working yourself until you fill the bar at the bottom of the screen and finish, all the while attempting to reach a 5x multiplier without setting yourself on fire.Visually, What’s Under Your Blanket?! looks like it could pass as a simple free-to-play web browser flash game and, well, it pretty much is, but with a price tag attached. Think early South Park episodes involving Canadians and without the shadows behind the characters, and you have an idea of what the visuals of this effort look like, but a lot more crude and poorly drawn by hand. Even the heads that appear in the doorway that interrupt you look like someone just pasted them on a black rectangle and called it a day. The backgrounds do have a little more to them, but that isn’t saying much, sadly, as almost all basically use the same floor designs and wallpaper behind whatever one or two objects are unique to that level’s sppearance.The audio isn’t anything too spectacular either. The simple electronica is catchy enough for multiple playthroughs, but some of the additional effects like the noise from hitting a multiplier of five and reaching “godlike” status is obnoxious and can drown out the footsteps of approaching family members, if not trick you into believing someone may be behind the door. There’s also some sounds lifted from other games, such as the “fight!” shout during the arm wrestling match between levels that clearly came from early Mortal Kombat entries.There really isn’t much else to be said for this title other than it’s a one-joke game that loses it’s impact after your first time through. What’s Under Your Blanket?! only has five levels, which can be done in about ten minutes, even less if you get bored and decide to cheat like I did by the third time through and load up a hotkey code or an automatic clicker tool to do the dirty work for you. The only real appeal of this title after the first one or two plays are the achievements, which are now unlockable following an update that dropped the day after its release. Well, that and the trading cards if you care if. All in all, finising the game entirely and unlocking those fourteen goals will put you at twenty to thirty minutes of game play for one dollar (US currency), which still doesn’t even feel worth it given that this is so basic and crudely done. What’s Under Your Blanket?! was fun for a few minutes, it gets redundant pretty quick, only worth your time and money if you enjoy achievement hunting, trading cards/badge collecting, or find this sort of humour the pinnacle of comedy.Overall Score: 4/10Review originally published atwww.apochs.net"

What is under your blanket?(Still wishing for a mixed review option, rather than a straight yes or no)Gameplay: The only 'story arc' is that you are a young guy trying to masturbate and you have avoid getting caught or game over. You can get caught your sister, grandmother, dad, Santa and a couple of other interesting characters. You can set the blanket on fire from masturbating too hard or you can get caught by police - Who come busting in with guns blazing.. (Hehe, did you see what I did there?)Graphics: Pixely, box like goodness.Menu: Extremely simplistic, volume and effects level bars and that is all . Simple controls (i.e; WASD and click), escape instantly quits game so there isn't even a pause menu.Soundtrack: Slight variations through levels, but in all it sticks to the same track that does get a tad bit annoying after the few minutes.Final Conclusion: What is under your blanket is appears to be a very similar game to 'Shower With Your Dad' simulator, but not in any of the good ways that SWYD sim did. See.. SWYD had decent and addictive game-play that actually took good, quick attention skills. This requires a clicker, or some serious wear and tear on your mouse for the sake of getting your boxy dude off.It gets irritating after a short time due to lack of content, lack of replay ability and just an all round lack of anything. The comic factor dies down very soon after you lose a couple of times - Having to restart from the very beginning each and every single time.In all, I guess for the short comedic burst, it's worth the money and few minutes of your time, but anything more than that, it's one of those games you play once and let it sit in your steam library forever more."

And play the mini game and go to the next one and keep going.So until there's some type pf pausing or level select: I wouldn't recommend it unless you're a very fast clicker. But you can get it for the ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles."

You have to walk to the door and close it to continue fapping. The only negative part of the game is that the game is really short. In about 15-30 minutes you can finish the game.

I have spent literally a thousand hours playing this game and I do not regret a single second of it. theres so much replay value its insane. I quit my job and have taken a ""temporary"" break from school since I bought this game on the day one release. I havent talked to the majority of my family or any of my friends months since ive been trying to prefect/start a pro whats under your blanket scene or as i call it WUYB!? and will be refering to it as so from now on in this review. The pure skill and time this game takes to actually be good at is insane everything about it is so satisfying from counting frames and pixels to get the perfect time strokes to door canceling your inputs to reach climax in record time, its an adrenaline rush from start to finish yes it is. If youre thinking about picking up this game and want to know my opinion as if it wasnt obvious already yes buy it you will not regret it. the only downside to me buying WUYB!? is the measly 150-175 extra pounds i have aquired since i started pioneering this game. The next thing I want to talk about might be my favourite part about this game, the story. It immediately pulls you in from the first second with the lovable and funny characters and intriguing story. for the sake of this review i will not be going into detail as i believe that the first playthrough of this masterpiece is possibly the best as you hold onto that wonder and sense of adventure with♥♥♥♥♥♥in hand. its truly beautiful if you ask me. I would go as far to say WUYB!? may have changed my life for the better, it has really taught me about love, friendship, and compassion. So to sum it all up yes. i do reccomend this game. but ONLY if you want to go on a grand, tear jerking (no pun intended), feels feeling, story telling work of art video game for the measly price of under 5 dollars."

I honestly think the difficultly would be fine if it current diffculty of the 3 level was the peak (last level difficulty). ** on a side note I honestly think I should ice my wrist.* How to play critique- doesn't explain what the ESC key does- doesn't explain how to get intruders outcat, grandpa, etc...- I feel like there should be or is some mechanic to continue play aftercops or firefighters show up- Lastlyon the win screen the only way to exit is the ESC key and it doesn't say anything* it would be nice to have a windowed mode* sounds seem to play too long e.g. cat's purring continues after it's gone andsirens continue too long but sounds cool with the music*when you get a ""god like""it's very hard to hear footsteps which has lead to me being caught several times :(FINAL THOUGHTSfor what it is and the price I give it a 9.5/10what would raise my score to 10, less carpal tunnel mode, such crapl toonlz!"

But you could see the graphics in the game's preview.  Were you expecting Fallout 4?  Guess that's a bad thing.  This game is not Fallout 4.  Intriguing and compelling story?  Did you miss the title of this game?  What kind of compelling story did you expect from a game titled ""What's under your blanket"" and with a description mentioning masturbation?  Were you expecting The Witcher 3?  Spoiler Alert, this game is not the Witcher 3.So what do I think of this game?  What else do I expect for something I bought from selling trading cards?  I got this game for free.  I have no expectations for this game other than a giggle.  It was cute.I see so many people saying ""I kept setting the blanket on fire""  Well if you actually clicked, without downloading a mouse clicker app, or going to a keyboard macro... its pretty hard to set yourself on fire.  I think the fire, bed breaking, tree collapsing is to stop people from using these tools.  That tells me that the dev actually considered with their clicker game that people would try to cheat.  And the anti cheat works.  It actually causes you to click.And people worried that some 12 year old child will get their hands on this game?  Watch your children's Steam purchases.  Parenting is so tough.It was a cute game.  I got an 89 cent giggle.  Still a better game than the Slaughtering Grounds and still a better dev than Konami"

So only reason you should want to get this useless clicker game is for the 100% achievements and after that just sell the Steam cards to get your money back.(Btw beware because you may need a new mouse after this)
