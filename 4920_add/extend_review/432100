Run a lingerie shop, look to hire girls, why didn't we think of this before?Unfortunately, the game is pretty tame in the visuals department (even with adult patch), with very few events, and the story is really, really lacking. Most of the story is listening to your main character (female) prattle on about how tough it is to run a store, day after day, and you just keep clicking through those internal thoughts.There was huge potential here but it missed the mark. After finishing the game in about an hour, getting the ""good"" Jasmine end, I have to say I saw very little of ANY of the girls, including Jasmine. It doesn't inspire me go for another playthrough."

,Recommended,432100,26138953,"Posted: 20 October, 2016",all,Akka,"If you get one game from Dharker Studios make it this oneI've played through a lot of their earlier works and Negligee really shows the greatest amount of effort. The inclusion of ACTUAL sex is a welcome (though long overdue) addition. Assuming you patched the game to include the adult content like a champion, you're treated to a series of erotic illustrations, sometimes animated, and all fully written out in graphic detail. Score.The storyline exists as a vehicle to feed the player a steady stream of cheesecake. I can't say the plot takes a backseat though since your decisions will impact who you spend time with. There's plenty of playful, flirtatious tension to enjoy as your team of new hires compete to impress you. This makes the writing just as crucial as the trysts you're rewarded with.Each playthrough is rather short, clocking in under two hours. The game caps off with 3 good endings, plus a bonus true end and several bad ones to hopefully avoid. Naturally subsequent playthroughs go quicker so you won't need more than 5 hours to see all the content.If you want to support more lewd games coming to steam, this is where it all begins buddy.If you like this game then check out Nekopara. There are a lot of parallels, including an adult patch that restores all the content cut from the steam release."
,Recommended,432100,29549085,Posted: 28 January,all,F4rseeR,"Ever wanted to take a break from saving galaxies, conquering kingdoms and exploring worlds ? How about waking up to finding out you're the new manager of a lingerie store?Before going any further, I have two things to say. I haven't played a visual nover before and I played the censored version of the game.Visual novels are composed of beautiful artwork, lots of fun reads and some choices which have to matter. This is the impression Negligee built for me. The menu is simple with some ambiental music. I had second thoughts, but considering that I could finish a playthrough in an hour or so(which meant I could still refund it), I ventured into starting a new game. It's all cute in the beginning: lovely artwork, nice music and the dialogue boxes that keep popping with new text. Despite seeing the Visual novel tag, I somehow didn't expect to have so much to read. Alas, it often proved an entartaining read.When you first look at the store page, this game looks like it's target audience constists of 15 year old who have yet to discover internet porn. That may be so, but as someone in his 20s, I can say there's some fun for the older demographics.Being the store manager that has to hire three good looking store in a place where lingerie gets sold is obivously erotic. When you have to choose if the employers have to wear their uniforms or do their job wearing nothing but their undies you can tell the game doesn't shy away from being exactly what it looks like.But it's the way everything is presented, the way it's composed that the content feels mature. It's the social awkardness that a 24 year old woman(main protagonist) faces when she's dealing with workers that are in their late teens and have a fondness for her. The different situations and dialogues and the options you have to deal with them makes what seems like a short game engrossing and replayable. As for the game's length, it depends on what  choices you make. You can hire someone on the spot or you can give everyone a chance by giving them a trial, prolonging the playthrough by two thirds.The girls have different personallities, which makes every convesation interesting, especially when you have to pick a side. You have Jasmin, the oldest and most serious, who wants this job because she's tired of being a stripper. Charlotte, the youngest, is sweet and extremely shy, being constantly mocked for being 13(she's 18, as she keeps replying). Sophie is the smart and ambitious, also the boldest, too bold even with her boss. All of them make an awesome combo which takes away the boredom from work. Depending on your choices, you'll have one of two possible clients who are looking for the right outfit. One is more open minded, while another one is nervous like a virgin who has nuns for friends and parent controlled internet at home.The artwork is gorgeous and make replaying the game totally worth it, not just for discovering new dialogue and situations, but also for feasting your eyes on tasteful erotic content(though the style might not be for all). A big plus is that all attractive images are unlocked in the CG Gallery, should you want to see them later.Having played through all possibilities I can say I've had some good laughs and genuine interest in what the girls were saying. The fact that I was playing as a girl was obvious at some points, but that didn't brainwash me into forgetting I have balls.While I feel like recommending this game to anyone, even those who would be skeptical, I'll confess that I'm still not into visual novels. However, I might come back to playing this game just for the sheer fun of it and trying out the uncensored patch.Negligee isn't just some unlockable erotic picture gallery, but also an entertaining adult story which can take many turns."

I earned every achievement (meaning I saw everything, endings and 'memories') in about 2 hours. I played the full story through once, and then used a guide to zip through the (mostly) same story again and again to snag the achievements. If you grinded through this yourself, yeah, you'd wrack up a bunch more hours but you'd have to be a glutton for punishment with reading nearly the same stuff over and over again.Sometimes I also think these types of games have an identity crisis.They want to have a legit story, but also mix in the X-rated content. It kind of works, but the whole thing just comes off super cheesy at the end of the day. It's all just one giant cliche of some kind of male fantasy setting. This genre would do well for themselves to get some real stories that are interesting and think outside of the box.Pros:+While there isn't a ton of artwork (it feels like there is at first - but there isn't), what is there is high quality. I think they would have done better to at least include a few more regular outfits for the girls (at least a different work outfit for each day of the single week in the game).+The menu options are great. Everything is there that you want, including an autoforward so you can watch it like a movie.+The patch is available.+Dialogue is well written (which I am seperating from 'storyline' quality as you will see in the 'cons').Meh:=Music is good at first, but when doing subsequent runs through I thought it felt a bit off and a poor fit.Cons:-Dialogue box is horribly placed and  you cannot move it. I mean it's a 'visual' novel and the put the dialogue in the worst possible place.-Not many girls, and more importantly - no variety to them. They all looked fairly similiar (seeHuniePopfor how to do this right).-Could have used more artwork.-A bit expensive for a few hours of content (again, I got > 20 hours out ofHuniePop).-Storyline is super cheesy. People that state the story is great must be either very young, or easily amused.Definitely do not pay full price.I think its a decent adult visual novel, but could have used more content and variety."

The art style is quite lovely, and the story is interesting for this kind of game. The only thing that bothered me was the lack of expression of Hanna’s (the MC) avatar. She’s always smiling, despite of what she’s saying. They drew different clothes for her sprite, but they didn’t made other facial expressions for her. That’s mostly a pet peeve of mine tho.The characters were okay. I liked Jasmine, she’s a cutie pie. It’s a short story, but it was fun to read.

,Recommended,432100,26132930,"Posted: 20 October, 2016",all,CaptainSharkFin,"For those not aware, Negligee is at its core a Hentai visual novel censored for a Steam release. An adult patch can be found and is free to download, easy to install. The file for the adult visualizations can also be easily taken out for the proper censored playthroughs.Though, let's be honest, we're all here for the porn.That's okay, though. There's absolutely no shame in admitting it.You see through the eyes of Hannah, a recently-promoted manager of a lingerie shop named Negligee. For some unknown reason, her previous manager had decided to quit and at the last minute the task of finding a new hire falls on her shoulders. Depending on your choices, you have a total of three options:Charlotte, a college undergrad just starting her secondary schooling,Sophie, a second-year undergrad going to the same school to become a fashion designer, andJasmin, a dancer at a local strip joint. The visual novel goes day-to-day as Hannah ""struggles"" to pick the perfect hire, and make friends with these three girls.The quality of the visuals is impressive, but pretty ""generic"" as an Anime visual novel -- I mean, not really surprising. I'm speaking as someone whose only VN experience was Nekopara, and that was it. Unfortunately there's no voice work in this game -- English, Japanese, or otherwise. I was slightly disappointed by this (although I hate listening to porn with the sound on, just makes it awkward).The dialog is the main selling point of a visual novel, I'm assuming, and honestly I enjoyed the dialog a lot more than I feel like I should have.There really isn't a whole lot to say about the game. It's got some glaring spelling/grammar issues in the text, but the character designs were pretty neat and if you have the adult patch installed, there's a few extra scenes that are pretty neat to watch through.The game takes place almost entirely inside the lingerie store, though, and as expected there's a lot of underwear involved. With one of the choices, the main cast members are wearing some really nice outfits. This is great for me because seeing a woman in lingerie is literally one of my fetishes.Seeing a woman period, even...Anyways! I'm recommending it for anyone who likes Visual Novels, but beyond that I guess it's nice to have something to relieve yourself with every now and then."

Wow, I think I've blown more brain cells reading such useless♥♥♥♥♥♥than a night of binge drinking.Rant aside, I was actually blown away at how good this game is, which is why I have such a hard on against trolling reviews that make it appear that the game is worse than it actually is.  Yes, I know it still says 'Very Positive', but if it weren't for such dickbutts, it could have been 'Overwhelmingly Positive'.What?  Ok, ok, I'll stop ranting about how broken the review system is.  As someone who has worked in retail, I can tell you that although this game is essentially a porn parody of life in retail, they got a lot of it right.  There's a very well-written scene where one of the girls is dealing with an irate customer.  Without spoiling anything, I felt the game accurately depicted how a salesperson might act in that situation.  A lot of the dialogue is side-splittingly hilarious and gleefully over the top.  There is no voice acting, which I actually approve of, because there are scenes that may look great on the page, would sound annoying as hell if acted out.Now that you've read this far, I know the question you are burning to ask: ""Is it fap worthy?""  My response is, ""With the uncensored patch released by the developers, absolutely yes.""  Steam guidelines would likely prohibit me from posting my sexy screenshots, but take it from me, it makes Witcher 3 look like Sesame Street in comparison. Another strong point is the games multiple endings.  When the description says ""11 alternate endings"", they are not kidding.  This is not Mass Effect 3 where nothing ever did meant anything in the end.  It even gives Telltale Games a run for their money in how to craft a game where your choices matter.To sum up, do you like yuri-themed hentai?  Do you like to fap?  Then buy this game.

The stunning detail (extra bonus with the HD wallpaper pack which adds some very useful information the characters including Height and Cup Size) is truly magnificent. For anyone who loves this unique and beautiful type of genre then this game visually is perfect for you. From cut scene to intermate moment everything is captured in perfect detail meaning nothing is missed from the reading processThe CharactersThe characters in the game are what truly takes it above other graphic type novels in the fact the detail that has gone into them including brining each individual character to life with intermate detail is truly fascinating and adds so much more depth than other novels. Each character has an interesting personality with one overarching theme (which to avoid spoilers I will not mention) which truly makes them so different but also so close at the same time making you connect with each character on a personal levelThe StoryWithout going into spoilers, the story most of the time is fantastic adding gripping twists and turns within the plot however at some points it can feel lacklustre and confusing, especially when enjoying it with others. These holes in the story however are mainly ironed out by the true beauty of the characters and the look of the Novel. The writing is fantastic; it keeps me guessing and gripped throughout and definitely look forward to buying other titles.10/10 would recommend to a friend, especially a lady friend"

,Recommended,432100,28927967,Posted: 1 January,all,PUT IT IN REVERSE TERRY!,"Before getting into the review of this game, there are a few things that needs to be stated. I originally bought this game out of interest into the genre of visual novel and saw this game on the Winter Sale, and also as joke to make my steam profile more weeb and stereotypically Asian (since I'm Asian). But it has sparked and interest to the genre of games.The Review:I found this game pretty chill, I just sat there clicking the game while reading the dialogue between the 'girls'. I found this story well written and detailed for a game that can be sped run within 2 hours (that's if you know all eleven endings to the game) which is a treat, otherwise this game is very short and pointless. I like the story; it's funny, detailed (mentioned, duh.) but at times rather weird and sexually inappropriate (guess it's the Hentai elements kicking in).As mentioned there are multiple endings to this game, thus there will be repeat of certain dialogue but there's a skip button so once you have read it, skip it! Which is what adds to the speed run element to it. The different elements are achieved through different dialogue choices with the characters, which adds a challenge since one will have to figure out different combinations of dialogue to achieve certain goals, it's fun and challenging. But if you feel lazy or even the endings difficult to achieve, there are detailed guides out on steam that can help:https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=785186200https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=789777700By WizardWorgen is a detailed and very good guide, follow their's if you're stuck.To the internet's eyes this game is perceived as a very weeb and near Hentai game, with skimpy lingerie and enormous breast. BUT it's 'near Hentai', there is an 'adult' patch released by Dharker Studios (which can be downloaded off their website); it transforms the game to 'full Hentai' with naked Ecchi sex. This patch will provide those rather sheltered individuals with great fapping material.In conclusion, this game is not everyone's cup of tea but ignoring the sexual images projected, the story is interesting and good content."

This game is a lot of fun, and super lewd without being over the top. I've actually had some of these interactions with my gal pals, so none of it is too far out of the realm of reality, either. There are a few spelling errors, but those come with the territory. Of course there is some stretching reality, as in I don't think it'd be a great idea for employee safety to walk around in lingerie all day with creepers gawking through the window, and some of the sexuality in the work place is inappropriate, but hey, I'm the pervert playing this game, and I find it entertaining.

Anyway, you are taking over a lingerie shop called Negligee, and need to find an assistant. Two to three girls show up to try for the job (The other choice in that first decision lets another girl show up). Going through the entire storyline and choosing in the correct way will lead to you being able to hire a specific girl... and them staying.

While Negligee's art was good overall, the experience feltdissapointingin the long run.PROS:- Fullscreen arts, gorgeous!- Uncensored vers. available!- Soundtracks (good)CONS:- Very few variance of characters's portrait- ""Animated scenes"": very low quality- Slow storyline and some parts are predictable- Relatively short story overall. Cleared 100% in 3h+- Railroading. Choice have minimal impact and outcome is more or less the same.Choices you make aren't that game changing.For example; a certain scene, an accident happen. Well no matter which character you chose to have help you out at that particular location, the exact same result happen. The outcome is more or less the same. It does affect which endings you get. You'd expect choices to bring you in a completely different direction: new scenes, varied backgrounds, new encounters, plot twists, etc. Don't expect theses here. There was a point I was just pressing next, next, next and hoping something would happen.Another thing to mention: Once you cleared an epilogue, you can skip dialogue you have previously seen. However, as I mentioned earlier, a LOT of scenes are very much alike with few differences. Well guess what: the skip button won't let you skip it because you never went through that exact path before. To the credit of the game's creator you can tweak some options in the settings to skip text regardless (until choices appears) at the click of a button. The drawback of that is you can accidentally skip new conversations by accident. Not good.------- ------- -------Would I recommend it? It would depends on your experiences (and tastes) with eroges overall. If you are curious and would like to try that genre out go ahead.

Without any guides or youtube help, I ended the game with the bad end option for Sophie, The Good and love end for Jasmin, and the good and love end for Charlotte.I very much enjoyed the game for the intricate paths and varying routes available, and the content of story was really nice too. Unlike most people, I loved the game for it's insight towards women's clothing, rather than the lewd scenes and perverted content. It was extremely cute in places, and really brought emotion in for Charlottes bad end and getting fired. That's a good visual novel that makes you have emotion for their success and failure. Getting Jasmin's and Charlotte's good endings were very rewarding emotionally. Good job.(But seriously... Sophie is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to get on the Harem path... like what the actual ♥♥♥♥....

They all have quirks that distinguish them nicely and (if you actually read everything) they have some nice fledged out personalities which i could appreciate. Ofcourse there is only so much you can do without writing a 600 pages, and i did feel that the character of Charlotte was the one that came short in this story.The bad endings in this game really made me feel bad for the different characters, and it made me feel bad for clicking the options that made the ending bad, which is excatly what i feel a game like this should do, because that means you feel for the characters.My favourite thing in this story must be the interractions between the characters, its not realistic, but more like a, i dont know... I would have to say i view it as the dream friendship, and that makes it all the while better when you get to hire them all.Take this review for what its worth, im not the one to give the most in-depth or best opinion, but all in all i found this game to be a really good time, and for any girls who might be looking for a game, my girlfriend found it fun and cute aswell so i guess it has her endorsement :)"

For me, it is safe to say I am in love with this genre of gaming. My first was Love Ribbon, so I was happily met with another girl on girl storyline or since it is a girl version, I believe its called yuri? Don't quote me on that haha. Anyway, Negligee is definitely filled with many story lines that you can explore. Each unique ending left me wanting for more and when I mean more, i wsh we could continue that storyline and see how much more there could be. Of course games must have some kind of end, but this game is definitely great at pulling you into the story and characters that want you wanting for more. There is an adult patch, which I was grateful for. Because in Love Ribbon, I downloaded the patch right away and saw the nudity, but when I didnt patch the game right away of Negligee, when I saw the first censored scene, I just HAD to download the patch. Overall, the game is a great story and some of the mechanics are alright such as the characters visualized and your own character. Honestly, Jazmin's smile just creeped the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me like no one smiles like that LOL Charlotte was definitely my favorite girl as it was hinted but I did not expect her bonus end like holy♥♥♥♥♥♥what a twist. Also, I am glad I can see our character but ever so small for most of the game if you dont see or choose the right choice where it happens to make you the center of the photo like when you are unloading the truck and your suit rips. I just wish when we saw our character talking, I wish it could have been a little bigger in my opinion and that is completely not not what she said.

The story is pretty straightforward: Your crazy boss has made you the manager of your store, and you have to hire one (or more in the 'harem' ending) new employees to replace you.It's not FANTASTIC, but it's a good way to spend a few hours. The controls are intuitive if you're familiar with Visual Novels, and the artwork is very nice even if some of the expressions and poses are a little weird.Mechanically, it has an issue where the sprites and dialogue are linked, so even if a conversation is exactly the same, if the character sprites are different, the Skip function is disabled. This isn't a huge deal if you use a guide, but if you're the type that likes to savescum and figure out all the endings on your own, it can be a little tiresome.The game doesn't really hide what it is, wish can also be a plus or a minus. There's no voice acting, but the script is tight and mostly logical with the characters having pretty distinct personalities.Only problem is it's so short we don't really get to know all the characters as much as we could. Which makes an odd bit of sense, considering they're trainees at a workplace. I still would have wanted a bit more characterization, but for what it is, it's fine.The price point is a weeeee bit high, especially considering the game only lasts about 5 hours if you do EVERYTHING, but I can definitely recommend the game itself if Yuri genre visual novels are your thing."

I recommend checking out the uncensored version which can be found on nutaku or just search using google, be warned the website will show pu**y, masturbation, and yeah! Also the game has really great artworks, HD and beautiful! Uncensored version is way more better because it has more dialogue and those ""sexxyyy scenes"". Anyways I recommend you checking it out if you love Visual novels that have really unique plots, in this game you pretty much run a lingerie store and so on... BUT GUYS UNCENSORED IS 10x WAY BETTER THAN STEAM VERSION!! YOU ARE MISSING OUT!!!!!"

I feel like these kinds of games shouldn't be taken serious, but are definetly worth the experience for what unique twist they bring to the table.Dharker Studio,Thank you very much for the experience.

My only complaints are that there needs to be a way to skip over dialogue you have already seen even with the new background or characters on the screen and the true ending was not as good as the other three good endings.  But these complaints are minimal compared to the fun I had playing this.  I look forward to what comes next from Dharker Studio."

,Not Recommended,432100,29054985,Posted: 6 January,all,Darbee,"Length: Short (2 - 10) hrs.Avg read: 3- 5 hrs for full clear (40mins - 70 mins for first route)Type: Dating SimDescription: The game follows a female protagonist named Hannah, as you/she are suddenly thrust into the role as manager of the lingerie store 'Negligee' in a small Beach Front Town.The owner agrees to find her some girls to join her in the shop, but it is down to you to decide who can work at the shop.Overall: At $12.99 USD it is overpriced for the content. I'd say you may enjoy as a shoujo ai but only if you pick it up on sale.(30% or more) Does have 11 endings but only 5 have any length to them. I'd say the uncensored patch is a must or you miss out on the endings imo. There are much better Shoujo ai stories or Yuri/ecchi out there but the options are very limited on steam atm.4/10"

Otherwise, you're essentially reading a story.Now if you want erotic japanimation fiction, I'm sure there are thousands of sites online that do that.  But if you're going to make a GAME, then make a GAME with more then 5 or 6 dialog choices....in other words, you only have about a half dozen chances to actually interact with the game......the rest is simply reading some boring dialog.I bought it on sale for $10, and it's a ripoff."
