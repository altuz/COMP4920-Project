Seems that the developer spended more time in creating a movie about the game than in the game itself. The status right now is still between alpha/beta and there is no general reaction to discussion posts or announcement for further process.This kind of developers destroying the idea of early access and this is very sad!Please find my original Post below.Best Regards-------------------------------------This is the game I was waiting for!I like to play all kind of city building simulations.

Plus the game makes no sense story wise. It would be more fun if it was just a cool Soviet style sandbox city builder with communist policy options, instead the point of the game is to terrorize people by randomly murdering folks? That makes no sense. I thought the game would be an actual city builder, where you maintained a soviet city, instead it's a series of teeny tiny maps where you build a couple houses and try to scare people for no sensible reason and that's about it.Cool music though, too bad the game isn't a sandbox soviet-themed city builder."

,Recommended,432250,22848678,"Posted: 7 May, 2016",all,Agathosdaimon,"great art style and some quite unique mechanics and challenges. Its not so much based on history but more a parody of what some soviety city is like - there are a lot of neat ideas brought to the fore in how the player uses state terror and the double-edged sword this can be in both trying to keep the civilians under control but also answer the demands from the central government. Its well worth getting, can though be a little difficult to start with as there are alot of options on screen and time is ticking and there is seemingly alot one must do to meet 5 year plan goals and such - to some extent the game expects one to fail a few times in meeting such goals i think."

I encountered no errors, and load times were a little long, but by no means unbearable. The art and design are very nice, and the score is very appealing, almost soothing in a brain-washing sort of way, which I can only imagine was intentional.The controls are easy enough to learn, though it may take some time to get used to the menus. One criticism of the menus is that they are not always labeled as what you may expect them to be labeled with, but that is easily overlooked once you learn the layout, which the current tutorial does a fine job of.The biggest issue I've had is a few grammatical issues with tutorial text and loading screens, but they are easily fixed, and easily forgiven.Even at its current state, I would recommend this game to someone who enjoys city sims, as well as one that likes puzzle type games."

I have always adored the 'fake' soviet unions akin to the ""Red Alert"" series and this game really hits that sweet spot of my very abstract love for the dirty dirty Ruskis. Therefore I give the following things as possible feedback/advice to help this game reach its true potential via polishing and refinement:- Slightly bigger maps, or at least an option for such- A ""free build"" mode thats not so heavy on the objectives but still contain them to help drive the game- A better explanation of the ""Terror"" abilities and a possible way of regenerating some of the points used (Maybe by completing objetives or something) Especially because meat and coal are vital to city survival in the early game- Please PLEASE make the soundtrack available for purchase if you can, Oh MY GOD THAT SOUNDTRACK SON, SO GOOD!!!There are probably a few things Ive forgotton to mention, Ill edit this if need be!

I do not mean the tutorial, but it takes quite a lot of trial and error to properly get the hang of the entire economy of the game, each resource and the ways they are created.2 - The geography of the map is riddiculously bad: Forests tiles are riddiculously awful and hindering any plans.3 - There is no indication on how to get ""Terror points"" (which are quite important for some decisions) and that they differ from the ""Terror meter""4 - You can only create your city focusing on souther border, as you can only place export tracks on southern border5 - ""Holes"" and water tiles ruining the map.6 - Various little bugs.However it is quite a fun little game, with a grotesque representation of a socialist state. Unfortunately it could be much much more (from making the game less ""Smartphoney"" to more sim-city-es, to including more complex needs, economics and politics mechanics)."

,Recommended,432250,22170933,"Posted: 31 March, 2016",all,Darkstar,"Soviet City has some of the most innovative and unique concepts I’ve seen in a city builder style game in a long time. I would have backed the game’s greenlight from the get-go based on the concept alone, but it had already been greenlit by the time I got there, so I followed it closely, watching and waiting for release.As a longtime student of Soviet history, especially of The Terror, I was mesmerized by the idea of being part of the uncaring, murderous socialist machine. Make no mistake, this is a very dark game. State sponsored murder on a large scale, is, in fact, a critical part of the economy in the system, and can’t be forgone if you want to succeed. In the horrifying picture of socialism it portrays, people are quite literally nothing more than resources to be either worked to death and then recycled, or simply murdered on a mass scale (and then recycled).Gameplay is similar to just about any other city builder, albeit strongly tied to mission objectives issued from above. Directives, such as “increase the population by 3,000”, can be met by building enough housing for those people, or by sneakier, more conniving methods typical of highly bureaucratic systems that are rife with corruption (you can simply have the birth certificates fudged at the local hospital and voila! 3,000 new “people” for the state).The art style is utterly fantastic, and one of my favorite aspects of the game. It captures the bleak, stultifying brutality of a country undergoing a mass terror campaign. Everything from the People’s Palace (presumably where your exalted self resides), straight down to the most decrepit apartment block, screams totalitarianism.The developer has been accused of “Russophobia” by a few very loud critics that presumably didn’t play the game, or only bought it just to accuse him of such. The same people seem to have little trouble throwing pejoratives his way about his nationality, and I find this terribly unfair. While many aspects of the art and even the concept harken back to Soviet Russia, they also evoke the other Soviet republics, Great Leap Forward China, North Korea and others in equal measure.  The word “Russia” is not used once, at least not that I’ve seen so far, and even if it is, that’s hardly “Russophobic” of the developer or his product. Let’s all be civil. If this game is “Russophobic” so are most of the Call of Duty titles.It’s an uncomfortable game, and it’s intended to be. It should make you feel a little bit… queasy, at times. That’s the idea.I highly recommend Soviet City to people that enjoy city builders, socio-political history and dark (bordering on macabre) humor."

,Recommended,432250,22171891,"Posted: 31 March, 2016",all,Sporkmonger,"Really interesting concept, badly in need of better introductory tutorials that actually make some kind of sense. Terror level and how to influence it is totally unintuitive. Iconography is unclear with insufficient tooltips to help explain what things do. It's a good game held back by bad UI. Buildings go idle and you have to send Mao to inspect, but explaination of this is absolutely terrible. Citizens randomly get upset and destroy everything, with the only immediate solution apparently being to kill people at random until you get the person who's unhappy. But if your terror level moves outside the acceptable range you just lose. Game doesn't explain why terror level goes up or down or how you earn terror points with which to kill people, so for the most part, when you lose you don't feel like you even know why. Basically,♥♥♥♥♥♥goes wrong constantly and it feels like you have to click stuff in the interface at random to solve. Again, it's a really great concept and maybe if you're the sort of person who doesn't mind stumbling around in the UI, you'll really like it.
