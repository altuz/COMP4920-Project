A great way to try the Rytmik Ultimate software. It's got simple placement options as well as a plethora of adjustments to make sounds your own. You can also add in notes via a virtual keyboard (which I have yet attempted to use.. Kept it simple for now.)... So far I would say it is software I look forward to using in future projects.

I messed with the program for more time, and found that it is much more simple to use than I thought.  It took me quite a bit of time to understand however, and I'm still trying to figure things out.  But, for $5, this is quite a nice little tool.Original Review (I originally had my review say ""not recommended""):  Has potential, but it's got a clunky mess of a layout with no description of how to use anything.  I can't tell if I'm actually able to make and place my own notes, or if I'm stuck using loops.  It's all unclear.  This is of course coming from someone who is not used to using intermediate music software like FruityLoops and the sort, so it may just be on me.  But, it'd be nice if the program was more user friendly and intuitive, which it just isn't right now.   I'm sure it'll get better with time."

,Recommended,432330,30703277,Posted: 24 March,all,demon_boy53,"Are you planning to make music for video games? This is a perfect tool for that. The files naturally come in .wav format, so you'll probably need an audio converter like Audacity, but otherwise this tool is very useful for creating great-sounding video game music. The user interface is easy to use, there's a whole lot of enjoyable instruments to work with, and the program allows you to save the data for 999 songs: you can export as many as you want, but those 999 will be perfectly editable."
,Recommended,432330,21489403,"Posted: 26 February, 2016",all,Sum1,"(original review)This program is hard to learn. It is marketed as an easy program, but a confusing sound making section complicates any chance of making anything your own. Nice default loops though...P.S. Also needs some video tutorials or something to get someone started in sound/music production(new review)Everything i sad above is a misunderstanding. (I still haven't used the loop making section though.) This thing is awesome and needs only a basic tutorial for the drag and drop interface (because someone won't understand it, it is way to simple.) This program is worth it if you don't want, dare I say it? royalty free music from random places on the internet (ugh). I would suggest this if you just want to mess around or are getting serious but just can't get that right feel of 8-16 bit."

The software itself is only 7 dollars, and you'd be able to try it for yourself and see if it's your cup of tea, and hey, if you like it, you can spend 11 more dollars on the DLC and have EVERYTHING that this software has to offer; absolutely everything.The range of sounds and effects are VERY wide; I couldn't even begin to describe how this program works because there's just so much to it—enough to be satisfied with what you can make.It just take a little bit of practice with quite a bit of patience to use this software every day/[mostly]night like I do ^.^"

But this lite version is absolutely not worth it. It's WAY too featureless. There is ONE instrument.I don't lke paid demos and that's what this is. Furthermore, for a program with that unintuitive interface this really is a bad demo because it took me a while scratching my head trying to find the other instruments. I was clicking everywhere, trying to find a basic drum to go with my beep boops until I realized that's all I was gonna get.If you have any interest in this application, watch some videos online, see if this is what you want then buy the fully featured version.As for me, I felt conned, to be really honest. I expected a lite version to have more features than that. This left a bad taste in my mouth and I will not be purchasing any other version of this software."

It's made for Ipad also so it has to be a little dumbed down but for easy music production besides like FLstudio, this one is cheap as heck and pretty great for what it is!\don't like how exporting takes the same time as the song length however."

With this  version all you get are two basic one note sound bytes that can only make what I can only describe as early DOS or commodore 64 music. Even then good luck trying to figure out how to use the damn thing on your own because the only way to learn how to use the software is to look up the manual on the official website (It's just a pet peeve of mine that i have to go to an external website just to learn how to use the software). To be honest this is my first music software I bought off steam (not the first I've used, that was FL Studio) and first impressions were terrible but after upgrading to Rytmik ultimate, I honestly like using it in my spare time when I'm not in the mood to play Gmod or TF2 (or any game for that matter)."

Rytmik is programmed with the UNITY 3d engine and it is not capable of being used as a DAW plug-in nor MIDI synth.  This is not a synthesizer. It is a very limited audio loop player.
