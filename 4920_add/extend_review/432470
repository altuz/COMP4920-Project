,Not Recommended,432470,22330175,"Posted: 9 April, 2016",all,Bodomi,"This game has a great idea behind it.. why oh why couldn't it have been developed by a proper competent developer?The game claims that almost all things can be interacted with, this is far from true.And the actual interaction system is horrible, you don't pick stuff up and look at it and move it around in your hand like you'd expect, you drag it across the floor, you drag a magazine or a cup across the floor.The movement in the game is bad, and the lighter to give you some light is so weak that I had to look at my keyboard to make sure I pressed the correct button then I looked down at my feet in-game and saw a spec of light.No subtitles, no key-rebinding. And why is the flashlight(lighter) bound to the button L? Why not T or Q or something closer to the rest of the buttons.Horrible, absolutelly horrible performance. I have a pretty damn strong PC and I was lagging all over and my FPS was in the ground, I had to turn everything to the worst setting to be able to play without ripping my hair out.The game tries to be scary, it tries to be some sort of horror but fails.The only scary thing if you really want it to be scary is the vocie of a woman talking, and her voice is extremely low, if you want to be able to make out any words then you'll have to turn your windows volume WAY up which will make you deaf as there is no in-game volume sliders, so all other sounds will probably blast your eardrums out.This game is simply unfinished. I don't.. I can't phatom why this was released as a finished product when it's clearly not. Why not just wait until it's finished or at least put it in early access.I'm really sad that this game got released so early, I bet if this game was released when it was actually finished, you know, when the game is playable performance-wise, when you've finished the options menu, it would've been so much better but now you've tainted everyone with a bad experience to this game.I can only assume that most of the positive reviews where for a CD-Key to the game or something. No one in their right mind would rate this game good.And by the way I'm pretty sure that the developers or something are going around disliking all negative reviews because as far as I can see most negative reviews instantly get like 2 or 3 dislikes.Edit: And yea, I almost instantly got 2 downvotes, cool."

At first I was annoyed by the poor illumination that the lighter gave but... it's a lighter it's obvious it's not the best font of light right. The ambience is good. The pitch black outsides is kind of frightening even on the house while I was opened doors or switching lights I felt like something was going to jump on me any moment. The game is short, but the story is good enough and the ending gave me the chills. Oh and it has trading cards that are worth the games price on sale or even more. I recommend it."

Its broken. Loading bar reaches 100% sound plays and nothing happensConclusion: Game dev was promising a port to unity engine 4 and removal of settings options. Looks really amateur based on the screenshots and looks not worth the time or effort to playthrough however if it gets fixed leave a comment and I will play this through again and reassess this review.

It was even hard to idle it for cards because it runs, hangs (alt tab works sort of, but will not actually switch), and had to reboot to get control back (start > power > restart).  But it does technically idle while hung, so I could get my trading cards.  On my 2nd attempt, I got it at least to accept the ""Rus Eng"" choice, then loaded indefinitely, and Alt + Tab shows a crash report.  In the end I could alt+tab to the crash window (although nothing pictured), hit enter, and it accepted the hidden dialog and I was back on my desktop.  What an adventure :) .I honestly only got it for trading cards, which it did deliver.  But it was the hardest way to get trading cards of any of the junk games I've bought for trading cards :) ."

Now they have a re-release version of it on Steam Greenlight trying to trick us into giving them votes again (I will admit to voting for them on Greenlight for this one) so they can sell it again under a slightly updated name.  The horror.---Once upon a midnight dreary, I was feeling bright and cheery,Until some technical problems I abhor.While I nodded in anticipation, the game it crashed, oh damnation,Met with errors, crashing, crashing, what a chore.""T is some glitch,"" I muttered, ""I'll try some more,""But appeared this way for evermore.Ah distinctly I complained about this failure of a game,But long it lingered in my brain, I felt the need to play some more.Eagerly I held my patience until the game it was updated,""No more crashes"", in sorrow I implored.I clicked my mouse, the game it soared,And displayed madness at the fore.---I initially bought this game when it was first released.  In my very brief playtime, the game repeatedly crashed at start-up.  In the two occasions I actually got into the game, once my mouse locked up in the settings menu unable to alter anything until the game crashed completely.  The other time I went straight into the game, getting about 1-2 FPS.  I believed my system was capable of handling this game with a GeForce GTX 970 and 16GB RAM, but alas, it was not to be.  I got a refund and that was that.Nonetheless, I kept thinking about the game, wishing I could have experienced it, and then I saw it again, on sale for £0.36, at that price I could hardly say no, it was worth seeing if it had been fixed.The technical problems I suffered are all gone, I’m happy to confirm I’m now running the game smoothly with all the settings maxed out, I knew my set-up could handle it.  This is the sort of game made for me, I love the writings of Edgar Allan Poe, I love games like Gone Home which give me a place to fully explore at my will.  But perhaps this game works better in the native Russian language.  It is clear the developers are trying hard, but the English translation is so bizarre I just can’t quite work out what the writing is trying to convey half the time. The quality of the writing is the key factor of a game such as this, when that doesn’t work, you’re just left to explore without any real sense of purpose or immersion.The developers have an interesting sense of humour, I’m sure there is a joke I’m missing about the fork next to the toilet.  I don’t understand it, but it’s still funny on a simple visual level.  Also the physics on the chest of drawers are pretty special, just pick them up and move them around like they’re in zero gravity, it’s quite novel in what is supposed to be a dark and moody game.The big issue for me though, is that the game entirely lacks an Invert Mouse option, which is simply unacceptable.  This can easily be patched in, but for a game claiming to be a release build and not an Early Access preview, this is inexcusable, especially as it has been out for some time now and has still not being implemented.  When basic essentials are missing from a game, you have to seriously question what is going on at the development end.  I'll happily edit this once (or if?) this essential feature is patched in.  But two months after the alleged release build was made available on Steam, I don't have high hopes.From an objective perspective, this game is not good and I cannot possibly recommend it.  But from a subjective personal perspective, I find it all quite entertaining.  If you want something competent, maybe look elsewhere.  If you’re happy to take a chance on a game that will utterly confuse and amaze you with unintended craziness, you could do a lot worse.  I'm going to go back in now and see what else I can do."

Let me give you a list of everything wrong with this game.The English translation is terrible.Your player movement is comparable to a slug.No matter how good of a computer you have, this game will shutter like crazy.The goal of the game is not clearThe entire game is covered in blackness unless you find some lights. (Its so dark I found it very difficult to know where I was going half the time)The locations of the keys are terrible and will sometimes not appear (You need keys to open some doors)I used a key to open a drawer and there was nothing inside it. [Glicth example]The only music I heard was in the title screen. (granted I could not finish the game because I could not find the last key to open the last locked door. and there are no guides explaining where its location is).In short, this game is terrible.
