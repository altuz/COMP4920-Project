It crashed nearly 3 times on us in 30 minutes. While we play almost exclusively indie and early access games, this is unheard of. There also needs to be fairly extensive developement on the menu and overall playing system done, before I can totally recommend.Pros:+Really fun to play, even in the current state+Price is probably too cheap+Graphics are quirky, and fun+Music and ambient sound is nice, at this pointCons:-Too buggy as of (1/13/16)-Needs better UI refinement and hotkeys-Probably needs further complexity and depth addedYeah, I mean its like three bucks. Its worth it, but I just hope developement continues quickly."

The first negative is impossible to load a saved game, at least I have not found the download. Another minus for some reason, when I saved 1,000 trees or food, my game crashes. I'd like to see in this game, barns and warehouses to store food and there is a tree.More would like you to have added more soldiers and Lords. If you have added more gold mines, it would be all right. You could dig for gold. Add to the economy of the game. I would like to add more new homes. If it were you added the tower was chivalrous, would do great! And I really liked the game forward upgrades!"

76561198056047123,Recommended,432500,20631406,"Posted: 19 January, 2016",all,rrocks,"Early Access ReviewFinally, a game that is priced appropriately for the content that it offers.The game is very early in development, and there is not much content at all. I will list the current content, and my pros/cons, during the review I will try to be objective as possible.Current Content=Farm: Used to grow crops, needed for unit construction.=House: Used to increase population limit.=Fence: Decorative item (not sure if it prevents hordes from attacking).=Road: Increases unit speed, although units do not ""auto-follow"" the roads (yet).=Tower: Used to deal ranged damage to enemies.=Woodcutter Shack: Used as a secondary resource drop for wood choppers.=Barracks: Currently in-game, although the materials needed to create it are absent (in my experience).Pros+Nostalgic 8-bit graphics, scanlines and all.+Good difficulty curve.+Ability to choose your hero class/perks.+Heroes respawn after falling in battle.+Promising game/mechanics.+Procedural world generation.+Ability to distribute XP ""your way"", i.e. either for Tech, or for Level UpgradesCons-Limited content (currently).-A.I. don't follow build orders/can't queue up build orders.-A.I. pathfinding needs improvement, guards appear to retreat to random areas after a conflict, rather than to their post.-Can only queue up to 5 units for creation at a time in the Town Center construction.-Menu options are very limited, don't seem to save preferences.-The procedural world generator can leave you with no resources, or room to build.Subjective/Personal ThoughtsThe game has a solid idea, using this low resolution graphical style the options seem to be limitless. Currently the game is very in development however. I have had maps start where I simply had no room what-so-ever to build due to terrain issues. This is because you cannot build on/cross over mountains, and water tiles.There are some trees (not sure if all) that seem to never deplete their resources (the fat oaks), I am not sure if this is intentional or not. The issue with this is that it goes against the idea of the game, that you have to outlast the waves of enemies with limited resources.Of course I would love to see more content in the way of resources, methods of transportation (boats/horses/etc), unit types, defensive structure types, a market, other A.I. towns, etc.GameplayThe idea of the game is simple, you have a settlement, a hero, and a few citizens to help start over. You must build up quickly because each night waves of enemies start attacking you. Right now, I haven't ""lost"" the game so-to-speak, which is a good thing for me, because I hate games that put you in a position to ultimately lose eventually. I like to have a little more control over my fate, and know that through good strategy I can win/survive.You start the game by picking your hero, his perk, and his class. You then have a handful of skill points that you can distribute before the game starts. Once you are in the game world, you task your workers to start on supplies, and your hunters to scout the area for resources, choke points, etc.Once nightfall hits, the hordes start moving in. I don't know how random the chances are, because I went through three nights straight without anybody bothering me, and that the same time I have been hit hard multiple nights in a row.Through surviving the nights (by killing enemies), and building various structures, you gain experience. This experience is then either ""saved"" to level up your town center, or spent to instantly learn new techs. As of right now, the options are very limited, but I like having the RPG element of picking and choosing how to distribute my own XP. Sometimes it may make more sense to spend that XP on a Fortify upgrade, rather than leveling up your Town Center.This pretty much sums up the gameplay in the games current state. There is not a lot to see or do at the moment, but for the price, it's more than appropriate. The only concern I have right now, is because of the price, how much content will the dev add in updates.NOTE:Some people are complaining of crashes. I have not experienced a single crash yet. The only bug I have found is, if I change from windowed to fullscreen via ALT+ENTER, the mouse cursor becomes out of sync with the game. I have been ALT+TABBING without any issues, and loading/exiting without any issues. The lower resolution may be an issue for some people depending on their pc setup, some graphics cards simply don't run windowed games at such low resolutions. You can see my build information in my profile.tl;drIt's a solid purchase at $2.99 to support further development. The only concern is the low price, was this meant to be what it is in it's current state, minus the bugs? Or, will the dev build on this and keep adding content/mechanics. That's a risk that's personally up to each person to take individually. I supported the dev in hopes that he continues to build on this game, I recommend others to do so as well, but I respect everyones personal decisions."

,Not Recommended,432500,20484536,"Posted: 12 January, 2016",all,JolliB,At this current state game is too buggy and incomplete and should have not even released with its current alpha state.   Map was very small and everything in this game that it can offer at this came can be accomplised in 10 mins.Major bug which is a game breaker for me is that villagers will randomly stop farming fields leaving you micromanaging them often since you have to put each one back to work.  When you have many farm plots going this can get tedious because not only do I have to keep an eye on them I need to watch which plots are vacant due to this bug so I can put the villagers back to work.Right now once you are set up there is nothing much to do since aside from playing mini tower defense when nightfall comes and you have to defend your base from the creatures that attacks your base.    I would say wait for this game to get develop or not buy it at all due to its curretn state
,Not Recommended,432500,24034978,"Posted: 2 July, 2016",all,Vtownhood,"You can pretty much beat this game in 30 mins or less. Not enough building options, quite frankly I don't believe it takes 7 months to add new buildings, enemies, perks, etc. to a 16-bit game. This may be more of a cash grab or maybe it's not. But don't buy this game please, there are no updates. The new version doesn't even let you get everything because the inventory is glitched, so you're just sitting there staring at new buildings you can't get or you can't see which is a real pain. Like you can't even train military units because the iron mine is replaced by a 2nd set of roads. Then tier 4 altogether doesn't even show.... It's not worth it. Save your money and move on."

Here's my first game play on the early access launch day:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDNtTFrUaLYAt this point, this game runs well with simple old school style pixel graphics, yet it is pretty fun to play if you can get past that.The game ended up crashing on me that ended my game just as the action got intense, so be sure you use the options in the top right of the game screen to save the game often if you buy this!  ..Just a heads up!  :-)I'd like to see improvements made to the AI of your villagers so they don't just stop working a given task requiring your micro-management and sometimes they just seem to take off in a random direction for no reason without being to to and get themselves killed, pretty frustating..but I guess it adds to the challenge lol.Overall, I can see this being a really fun little game if the developer continues working on this and fixes a few things, and keeps adding content.  I hope that he/she doesn't give up or abandon this, and if you find my video of this game or this game interesting, perhaps show your support with the small purchase cost!  I personally already see enough value in this game to warant the cost, just be sure you save often in case it crashes on you!  :-DI like it.  :-)"

Besides some bugfixes on release, because for some the game flat out didn't work, this ""game"" has had no update since release. It does not even really deserve to be called a game at this point, it's more of a prototype.Basically a short time after release the developer decided the engine wasn't good enough for what he wanted to do with the game. He said he decided to port it over to another engine and redo everything, that was more or less the last meaningful thing he ever posted on steam and besides a gif and a screenshot(iirc) a while back and answering someone that he's still working on the game there's no real proof that this project is ever going anywhere.So unless you don't mind paying 3$ for a very shallow, short and potentially crash filled sandbox RTS just move along, there's better alternatives, both paid for and free, out there."

76561197986155483,Not Recommended,432500,20498350,"Posted: 12 January, 2016",all,GTH,"Pros - The game design is quite nice and it could easily be an addictive way to pass your time as the leveling feature keeps you playing to try expand.Cons - As already mentioned in other reviews, the game is extremely buggy at the moment. Within an average time of 5-10 minutes of playing the game completely crashes.I feel like this is just not acceptable to release a game in that state. Surely it must have been tested and the developer fully aware of the game state. Hopefully it is fixed soon.In terms of game play, quite a number of things to improve but that is expected due to this being an early access game so ill leave those out for now.The crashing really limited the chance to fully explore the actual game content, i will be happy to change my recommendation when the crashing is not at least as frequent."

The pixel art style would be fine without it, but personally it makes it impossible to play for me.

If you can get it on sale, great. But if I knew I would play it over 2 hours the first time I even tried it, I would have bought it for full price. Yes, there are free games exactly like it. There are similarly priced games that are better. ANd there are expensive games that are better. But I'm not comparing it to the rest of the world, I'm enjoying it for what it is.Only down side is that if your town gets too massive the game crashes.(I'm talking span the entire map with farmers type massive)Edit: Barracks doesn't work because the resources required don't exist. Looks like the game is unfinished. So don;t go into it expecting the full experience."
