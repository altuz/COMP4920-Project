The AI sometimes does very stupid things.Get the game on sale for at least 60% off in its current condition of today."

Played the Ipad version before I knew it was on steam. I have this glitch where All the text just appears as boxes which is annoying, but It is still a hella fun game and so worth it.EDIT: Game developer even contacted me and helped me to fix the glitch in a few days total. Even gave me a sneak peek on what the next update holds :)"
,Recommended,432870,22640120,"Posted: 25 April, 2016",all,Doom,"This game is quite fun for being in early access and I would say it's quite worth the money.Pros:-The game has a very good tutorial, which makes it easy to learn-It has a pretty fun campaign-The multiplayer is also quite fun and even more fun if you play with a friend.-No lag / connection issues in multiplayer so farCons:-You can't type whatever you'd like to say in multiplayer. (There's a box where you choose phrases to say)That's pretty much the only con I've found so far."
,Not Recommended,432870,22354567,"Posted: 11 April, 2016",all,quadZ.,Bought the game mainly for the multiplayer.As a Recruit I've been matched against Elite and Master ranked players 23(!) times in a row. Then I gave up...You don't stand a chance against them. They have more experience and way higher equipment to compete with.It's a no for me.
,Not Recommended,432870,25242039,"Posted: 29 August, 2016",all,XaeroSignal,"Can't figure out why this game has possitive reviews. The movement and combat mechanics are clunky and awkward. The animations are stiff and these ""tactical"" characters unload an entire magazine each turn into an enemy when they attack. Door Kickers and Breach & Clear already did everything this game does but better."
76561198080159836,Recommended,432870,22664024,"Posted: 27 April, 2016",all,Jesse_Eisenberg,"This game is amazing for the price. The multiplayer is fun, and has the potential to be re♥♥♥♥ed many many times. My only con with the game is that sometimes it can take a while to find an opponent on multiplayer but apart from that the game has been incredibly fun."
,Recommended,432870,23417855,"Posted: 6 June, 2016",all,Furrydaus,"My Personal Rating for this game: 8/10Special Tactics is an amazingly in-depth game. Looking at it head on may not seem like the best thing to do but when you go into the gameplay more, you'll find every decision you make can and will change the outcome of each single player mission.The tutorial paves a fantastic route for new players to get into the game.Game Engine wise, it will and CAN play on almost EVERY system (unless you're playing on a really crappy potato machine)The game has many different mechanics from grenade deployment, boosters (this are free every round. No IAPs), movement, vision tracking and more. The mechanics may look simple but you will slowly and gradually get used to it and find out you can do a lot of more complicated plan adjustment.Multiplayer seems to be dead at least from my standpointThe game itself does not look great and may disappoint some of you guys out there (I know I am a bit disappointed at the graphics).It is priced at a cheap $10.50 but till now, I don't feel like I have my full money's worth just yet. This is probably due to me playing a lot of value based games instead of this. Yes, I paid the full price in case anyone was wondering."
,Recommended,432870,22617683,"Posted: 24 April, 2016",all,[DJK]Piberius#Rusty,"Cool game and all though, Playing agaisnt players with silenced gear is no fun,Information is limited where Silenced players usually leave no trace if you were camera was not the specific place you were getting shot from,Will be taking my money back for now, Might buy the game in the future,Suggestions:With the small community playing the game, At least set some balancing in terms of  equipment,I just started the game played through some campaing missions then played multiplayer matches where I was matched up with silvers who had full silenced gear. Feels like the enemy is hacking when he can get his/her soldiers behind my lines in 2 turns,"

,Recommended,432870,24555923,"Posted: 27 July, 2016",all,Azxc,"This game is okay if you have a friend or two to play against withThough I have to warn you that the developer is a bit lazy and he is currently taking a break from programming =(so don't expect any new updates and other fancy stuffBut this is a damn good strategy game, go for it if you are really into strategy games"
,Recommended,432870,23412711,"Posted: 5 June, 2016",all,Seanharrs,"An interesting way to make a real time game ""turn-based"". I quite enjoy it, it's just a shame there's few players. I highly recommend if you have a friend who will play with you, or if you don't mind the endless survival modes in games (single player), but otherwise you might have to hold off until the playerbase increases. Hard to find a ranked match, and unranked is only with friends."

Not the highest graphical standards, but good enough for the price.  Worth the fair price of < 10 € !!!I did not try the multiplayer yet.If you like the mechanics of a game like this, don't hesitate to buy.02/05:I tried the multiplayer...don't even try to start it, you will get only experienced high level players...there is no fair matching...it's not even something you can call a game...scandalous !!"
,Recommended,432870,22795496,"Posted: 4 May, 2016",all,Rubix,"Very good game, and very fun. My only complaint is the matchmaking which tends to pitch me (a level 2 noob :3) against level 100 people. It's rather frsutrating as they have a lot more experiance in the game and have therefore learnt what tactics work good and really know how to utilise their guys properly. They also have much better gear an will shred me to pieces.There's no point in saying ""git gud"" or ""use better tactics"" because the fact of the matter is: I only have a few hours on the game, and the people I usually fight have a few hundred hours. Kind of unfair don't you think?Still, this is a really fun game and tho the matchmaking can screw you over, I have had a few cases where I destroyed a high level player simply by playing better than them. I definately reccomend this to anyone who likes tuen based tactical games."

,Recommended,432870,22698375,"Posted: 28 April, 2016",all,Lord Marsden,If you have a spare 10 bucks buy it. Otherwise skip it. Mainly because of bad ui design. At first glance i htought the graphics were bad but in game there better than i htought. All it needs to do to justify the purchase alot more is more/better keyboard shortcuts and better ui cause its really bad right now.
