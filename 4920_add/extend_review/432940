I really appreciated that. I went ahead and purchased the game and I'm glad I did.I have only played it a little bit but so far I'm really enjoying it. Good graphics (with no lag), great explosions (I've died a lot). Lots of perks and rewards with daily rewards and challenges. There are a lot of different paths you can try each time you race and its quite addicting.Hopefully, see you on the leaderboards."

The levels can get fairly repetitive day to day, and quite often you're at the mercy of pick up spawns but the majority is about skill and memorising the patterns.For a few quid it gives plenty of hours of fun (5 hours in a week for me and about 20-30 mins every day usual)."

The course changes every 24 hours, and the sun position and weather conditions often change too - sometimes to full-on sandstorms.The ever-changing courses and scoreboards make you come back for more.  Used to play this on Android, but free of adverts and with a decent progression system - this is the version to play.Looks great, and is good for short games or lengthy driving sessions.The price is a steal when considering the replayability."

The game maps change every 24 hours, so each day you end up racing a new set of levels to try and beat other players for top spot on the leaderboard. You get to outfit your ship with some cool skins, and more importantly, upgrade it with special capabilities (""perks"") to help you stay ahead of a relentless pursuit vessel that wants to zap your ship into smithereens."

Easily among my top time killers, action, speed racing, chasing, and full throttle addrenaline as to try and get further and further each time, slightly laggy with my laptop, but i believe thats simply because its a cheap laptop without a video card, but i think some graphics options like on the tablets/phones would be a little helpful for the weaker systems like mine. (seriously, only running a CPU and RAM here, beside directX lol...)10/10, would crash into a stone wall and burst into a ball of flames again....and again....and again...(P.S. steam client version has very little users, tournaments are a walk in the park if you know what you're doing ^.^ happy crashing!)"
76561198173606567,Recommended,432940,24819899,"Posted: 10 August, 2016",all,KeinSchiesse,"A nice-looking, easy-to-play futuristic Racer / Runner with a simple premise of beating your last best distance, while veering to collect pickups (i.e. infinite boost for a limited time, a jammer to buy you more distance between the pursuing menace...) Cool futuristic designs and several pickups to use in the middle of races adds complexity, as do the always branching paths and unique risk/reward boost mechanic similar to the Burnout franchise's ""Near Miss"" points...+Nice Futuristic Graphics / Effects / Soundtrack+Interesting ""Beat Your Own Personal Best"" and Risk / Reward Boost System+Global Leaderboards / Global Competition-No Head to Head / Same Race VS Multiplayer-the main 'pickup' noise of the game's overall currency, which you will be getting the most of, is a bit loud and obnoxious, however the soundtrack is full of such good tunes you will be enjoying those instead of this however itd be nice to have an option to turn off this sound as it begins to grate a bit, but I like the sound design of the game overall quite a bit.The soundtrack is good electronic music as well, I hope a UI showing the artist - track of the soundtrack is displayed at some point.Of the futuristic racing titles offered on Steam, it's one that is well-made and fun to play. For an early access title, the game has evolved a lot from its early release to its present iteration,the developers have done a good variety of tracks despite the game's seemingly simple overall arc at first. I don't want to spoil what you encounter too much but from level to level as you increase your max distance and see how far you can ""run"" on the game, but they have a good variety of effects to dodge and things going on in the background of the levels to keep you on your toes *spoilers for level surprises / descriptions*i.e. buildings / pipelines falling / sandworms diving in front of you, abstract diamonds falling from the sky, etc...For the game's small asking price I have enjoyed playing many times, in short spurts, to see how far I can get real quickly, but I have always enjoyed that there is a new race pretty much each day, generated by the game, it makes for a really cool variety of areas to navigate and always feels fresh. I do wish there were a bit more effects ie night racing / weather effects or more musical tracks on the soundtrack but what all is here I like a lot."

It has a few few rough edges (being converted from a mobile game and being in Early Access), but aside from that it runs very well.The graphics are very nice, especially the craft detail.It is a shame that it has been abandoned now, and so is only worth getting in a sale.Update : Apparently it hasn't been abandoned :""Thank you for contacting PikPok Customer Support.Breakout has not been abandoned. We are planning on a full release of the Steam version with VR support soon.But there is no new content planned beyond this, at this time."""

,Recommended,432940,21053073,"Posted: 8 February, 2016",all,Raketenziesel,"It's definitely fun and obviously heavily inspired by Race the Sun, and that's a good thing. What the letter had going for it in the sort of abstraction this one is pursuing a more realistic visual style of techno-dystopia. Yet feels way more unforgiving, since you can't jump out of dead end and only offer one retry per run, so memorizing patterns adds some nice variants to later game stages. It even has Dune sized metal sand worms popping out if nowhere.The great soundtrack gives it a Gesaffelstein'ish atmosphere, yet could use some expansion over the the currently very short playlist.The multiplayer leader board is nice and after a few day of playing you get a feeling that it really is quite unforgiving after stage 15 or so, even the upgrades won't get you much further, so it's a quite leveled ladder.Developers are currently (Feb 2016) very responsive and might fix some minor issues with controllers and non-16:9 ratios."

Well this is the game you need to buy!Don't misunderstand me, I'm not saying you'll only spend 10 minutes playing this game. In fact you'll probably spend 10 minutes each day for the rest of your life playing this game.That's my little bit over and done with so I'm just going to sum the rest up in quick points.- Fast paced post apocalyptic hover cars- Power ups, upgrades, kits and BOOST!- Daily Tournaments and PrizesThe more you play the more you'll want to be better, give it a go!"

,Recommended,432940,22001158,"Posted: 23 March, 2016",all,SimpleSimon,"Breakneck is like an endless runner and has leader boards.You can earn in game currency which you can purchase perks and perk upgrades which you will need as you are scored on the distance you travel. With a ""pursuer"" always hunting you down you need to keep ahead, so being strategic with your choice of perks is a must.You get a wide direction to travel left and right giving you plenty of choices how you are going to get through the zones, keep an eye out for perk pick ups, avoid crashing, and avoid the ""pursuer"" which will take you down if it catches up with you.Every day the game levels are changed up a bit to keep the challenge up, this is good and keeps it relatively fresh each day. What the game needs though are some more zone variants, right now there seems to be 3 or 4, and while they do vary on each visit during your play through it would be cool to have a more diverse change of scenery.Graphics are really good and fast, and the electronic music is very fitting the game, again a little more variation on that would be nice since it is essentially one track that loops (other than changing when the pursuer is on you).One last thing I need to point out, while the game runs great there are the odd accassional time where it will freeze for a split second, this is real bad when your on a twitchy section, this problem has cost me high scores a few times. I noticed this happens if you head far left or right, its as if the game has to briefly load that area in.Other than that this is a great time waster and ooozes that just one more try appeal."

It has amazing graphics and TONS of action. It is far better than the mobile edition of the game and is worth 5 dollars. The soundtrack is awesome with epic music suited exactly for the high speed action the game delivers. The zones each have their own look and chaos happens in the background as you try to go as far as possible! 10/10 would buy again:)

76561198017076013,Recommended,432940,21776445,"Posted: 11 March, 2016",all,Texelion,"Well, that's really promising. Not sure I was going to like this kind of ""racer"", but in the end it's pretty addictive.Pros :- nice graphics- tight controls- really fast- good sense of progression ( you'll probably do ♥♥♥♥♥♥ scores the first days until you unlock stuff )- ""OH SH*T"" moments- easy to play ( you only need to steer left and right, and one button to boost ), difficult to master- day-night ""cycle"" and weather that change every day ( today there was a sand storm ).Cons :- really repetitive electro music- feels like a pay-to-win mobile game at first with mecanisms like ""collect reward"", ""quick unlock this and that with coins"", but it's not : everything can be unlocked by playing- UI is a pain to navigate with a controller and there is no ""retry"" button, after each run you have to go through at least 5 or 6 panels to start the race again.- the engine has problems displaying the obstacles fast enough sometimes, stuff will appear in your face- some mesh flickering- pick-ups are random and can ruin a run if you only stumble on the ""bad"" ones- barely any options currently, you can change the language, turn sound and music on/off, and that's it. You can't even just lower the volume a bit, it's either on or off.So basically what is this game ?You have a really fast ship and you must outrun some alien pursuer before they can lock some laser weapon on you that will one-shoot you. You race through short levels, each one is different from the previous one, in a few different ""biomes"" ( industrial zone, alien fortress, etc. ), and the trick is that you have to get really close to walls to reload your booster. It's not just a mindless ""go-as-fast-as-possible"" game, because you have to manage your boost to avoid running out of it in a critical moment, while finding the best path with the good pick-ups to help you. The fastest path is not always the best.You earn XP and levels, which unlocks new features, and you also earn three different currencies : gold coins, blue insignas and purple bonuses. Gold coins are mostly used to buy advantages before each race ( an advantage is like ""you get some free boost at the beginning of each zone"" ), but each advantage slot must be unlocked by blue insignas. Each advantage is lost if you die or get catched by the aliens, and you have to rebuy it ( or not, you can also race without any advantage but you won't get far ).When you reach some levels you'll also unlock power-ups that will appear in the race, and you can upgrade these power-ups with insignas and purple bonuses.At the end of each day you get rewards based on your rank, new skins for your ship, blue insignas, etc.Oh and on top of that there are a bunch of ""missions"" you can do during the race to earn more rewards, like ""collecting 100 coins"", ""finishing 5 zones without hitting anything"", etc.It's all pretty confusing at first but it makes the game more interesting."

PC version has much better graphics and visuals2. PC version makes it so premuim currency is no longer somthing you have to buy3. PC version is being worked on very consistantly with lots of updates.The only bummer is the seperate leaderboards for iOs and PC and that you can't sync the accounts together but that's not too big of a deal to me.

I like the tournaments that happen daily and give high rewards, lately I saw some new players play it. Kinda sucks that not that many people play it, such as previous of the tournaments, it's very easy to get high on the leaderboard. Which personally I don't mind becuase ""ooh yay more prizes,"" but I feel like it may be more fun for me at least if more people played it. I always see the same 7 people on the leaderboard and it's always the same person in first place, sometimes I could be in 8th or 2nd; with that said it kinda sucks that people play it.With that said, it doesn't have to be a competitive game, I usually try to beat my high score, yes, it's fun to get a high score on the leaderboard but I find it more fun to beat your own score. With the powerups and pickups it makes it fun and easier to go futher. The pickups make it a lot more fun, something to help you get the boost that could make it to the next level.It also runs very well on my computer and I find the controls easy to use, I mostly play FPS games so I like easy controls. It plays similar to Audiosurf, you can you your mouse, arrow keys, and a controller. All 3 I find easy to use, I prefer the controller but thats me.  With an OK computer that can run games at a minimum of 20 frames to a max of nearly 150, in scenes where there's a lot of things going on, my frames never drop, never freeze, anything like that."
