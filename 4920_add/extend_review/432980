Sounds confusing right? Well don't worry. It's only a little bit confusing. Anyway, INVERSUS is a game I can definitely recommend, but while it is an amazing game, no game is perfect.THE PROSThe gameplay is very very well done, very smooth, and every mistake you make is always your faultArcade mode is a great addition to the game and is very frantic and funThe soundtrack is just... awesomeIt has a really amazing and nice communityBest. Developer. Ever. He constantly does contests to win steam keys and is almost always willing to talk :DVery, VERY fun with friendsColor palettes help switch up the game lookEmotes.Very easy to learn, hard to master, especially in arcadeTHE CONSThe biggest con is the lack of a big community. This game is VERY small in terms of its playerbase and could definitely use a LOT more players to make finding matches in online searching much easier.The price is a tad too high for what the game is, I feel like 10 dollars or lower is a good price for it.Only three modes, the default 1v1 and 2v2 and arcade, also with a coop. Could definitely use some more interesting ones.Overall, INVERSUS is an amazing concept that is put together so so well, but is definitely lacking in its playerbase. My suggestion would be to buy this game, and whenever the game goes on sale or something, tell all your friends! The gameplay is spot on, its intense, it has a good singleplayer, but I already mentioned all this in the review.JUST GO AND BUY IT ALREADY 10/10"

I never got into a match after 5 minutes, but the game just came out and my guess is there just wasn't anyone playing online at the time.  Hopefully this improves with time.I absolutely recommend picking up this game if you like arcade multiplayer games.  It's a game I'm going to enjoy playing with my friends for quite a while."

76561198205577637,Recommended,432980,26434555,"Posted: 5 November, 2016",all,UnoSquid,"I first encountered an early build of Inversus at Bit Bash 2015, and was instantly impressed. At the time, there was just multiplayer mode and only about 7 or so stages, but it was already apparent that this was something special. The core mechanics were quite simple, but allowed for impressive strategic depth, intertwining shooting with territory control. Think Othello mixed with a competitive top-down shooter.Since then, the developer has added about another 20 multiplayer stages, online play, a single-player arcade mode with 7 stages, and numerous unlockables, turning what was a promising demo into a quite compelling game.Unfortunately, matchmaking appears quite sparse at the moment, but if you have friends to play with, Inversus comes highly recommended."
,Recommended,432980,33332494,Posted: 6 July,all,Sensual Lettuce,"This is a tremendous multiplayer game to play with friends. I bought it in the recent Steam sale without much expectation but it has surprised me with its combination of fast pace and strategic depth. Since you can only travel on tiles which are the opposite color, you are torn between clearing space on the map to navigate and targeting your opponents. The pacing of multiplayer is great and levels are unlocked quickly, giving you a lot of variety in terms of level designer. Overall a fantastic game."
,Recommended,432980,25340414,"Posted: 4 September, 2016",all,James76931,"Don't be fooled by the simplistic design. This game is an amazing third person shooter where you, a square, must dodge, shoot and run from various enemies on a grid. In versus mode, you must use your bullets to eliminate the other player whilst changing the tiles on the board for you to walk across, whilst your enemy will do the same and may attempt to trap you by closing you in from the sides. As well as this, there is an arcade mode against bots (Which can also be played in a cooperative mode with your friends) where you have to survive waves of red square enemies and bot versions of the other players in versus whilst once again making paths to cross and trying not to get trapped on a path. (P.S: I think there are more enemies, it's just I haven't got to that stage yet xD). Arcade mode ends when both players lose all their lives in cooperative or when you lose all your lives in singleplayer.This game is brilliant but needs more players :)I'd definitely recommend this game, but people may mistake the simplistic design with the price. Maybe the dev could boost the players with a sale of some sorts and more gamers would see that not all simplistic games ""aren't fun"" because fun games don't have to have AAA graphics. As long as it fits it's design well and has good gameplay, I'd call it a good game.Overall: 10/10"

Playing that again i feel like its even more polished and awesome now! They managed to make the single player REALLY enjoyable for high score chasers like myself cant wait to dive back in. I also got to dive into some multiplayer which i was really excited for. Someone named Gongon poped into my game and we went back and forth at it for about an hour stright !!! keep in mind matches last what, maybe 2 minutes or so ? so you can do the math how many matches we played ! You can tell after a while we were both playing mind games and trying different strats on each other, what a blast.You can pretty much see what your getting yourself into this game in the trailer so ill tell you a thing or two that you CANT SEE. There is actually a good amount of strat. that goes into VS. people in this game. From Board Managment (controlling a specific part on the board or just trying to control the powerful/fast Red Bullet pick ups) or the Bullet managment (When to shoot or try and counter what the opponent is going for, when to use a charge shot as opposed to some quick fast shots) Cant wait to dive back in =)"

,Recommended,432980,26200476,"Posted: 24 October, 2016",all,StevenSeagal,"Inversus is a fantastic combination of deceptively simple gameplay with great strategic depth. I'm a big Geometry Wars fan, and this game doesn't feel like a replacement or a successor so much as a competitive compliment. There are two modes: verus and arcade. Arcade has you unlock levels one at a time, which is sometimes necessary for some of the more brain-bending levels, but just a little bit slower than I'd like. Versus is where the game really shines, though, if you can find a match.There are some maps in Inversus that wrap around themselves, so your ship and enemy ships are repeated throughout the screen. This is a very interesting aspect of the game and adds a lot of strategic depth. You may be focused on your ship on one side of the screen, but since the level might wrap around, an enemy could fire and have the bullet hit you from where you weren't looking. In versus mode especially, this builds into a large element of mindgames, positioning and fighting for the timing of powerups.When I have been able to connect to a match online, it's been very fun. The netcode is superb, everything is quite responsive, the gameplay is quick but very thoughtful. The only issue is that no one seems to be playing it online. The game works just as well as a multiplayer couch game, though.The game has a lot of promise and is immensely fun to play with others. I feel like the full game price is worth the quality of the gameplay, but some frugal players might be turned away until a sale."

I almost wrote a really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off review about it. Dunkey talked about this game in one of his videos on pax. really nice game but I had a few problems getting it started on my nvidia card. I updated it and now it will open. Once I closed it though it didn't allow me to reopen the game after I exited, so I guess I'll have to restart steam I guess to get it going again."
,Recommended,432980,25131655,"Posted: 25 August, 2016",all,CXZman,"There are two games in one. The solo arcade mode and the duel multiplayer mode.The solo mode is a great thinking/acting fast minimalistic game with reasonable challenge, simple yet powerful leveldesign and a good overall quick to the point game. And leaderboards.The duel mode is more like a jousting/fencing game with a fine tactical sense and a demanding awareness due to ""warp"" walls around playfields.Not the most profound game around, but a solid simple fast action game that will really shine as a party game. Heartfully recommended !"

The mode is great for solo/co-op, using friends-based or global leaderboards to keep track of just how far you've got to go to get to the top. Arcade games can be played while waiting in an online lobby too, good for a warm-up while you're waiting for your next opponent.""Versus Mode"" is the game's player vs. player game type. Versus games can be played either 1 vs 1, or 2 vs 2. Getting a match online can be difficult from time to time, but the offical Discord channel is a perfect resource, with channels specific to finding folks that play the game. The leaderboards also keep track of versus rank in the background, so you can fight your way to the top if you're feeling saucy.INVERSUS is awesome. Play INVERSUS."
