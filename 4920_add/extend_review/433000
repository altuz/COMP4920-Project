The game itself is quite complicated to play as you hardly ever know where to use which item and backtracking to the start of the game happens all the time. The presentation is fine, but the puzzles and mini games are all rather bland.Please remove this advertisment nonsense from your game. Thank you."

76561198024972696,Not Recommended,433000,29386786,Posted: 20 January,all,DALCOhstangultion,"The game starts with an advertisement screen for the company's other games.  Later, it pops up a nag screen to rate it.  I paid for this game.  It's not freeware.  So, here's the rating it demands:  Not Recommended.  Fish poops.EDIT:  After a total of 15.9 hours (9.8 hours to complete the base game on Hard without maps, 1.8 hours, similarly, for the Bonus Chapter, and 4.3 hours to get the remaining Achievements (on Easy with maps)), I've now finished the game.  So, here's some information on the game, itself.  It basically plays almost exactly like the previous game (Lost Lands:  The Four Horsemen (TFH)):- A lot of good work went into the story, graphics, and puzzles.- The voice acting is fairly terrible (about par for the genre).- The puzzles aren't Hidden Object Games (HOGs), they're Chain of Object Games (COOGs).- The collectables (particularly the morphing objects and the statuettes) are so ridiculously camouflaged that they're essentially impossible to get.- The key/lock pairs are so far apart physically and temporally that it's impossible to remember what belongs to what (or even that it exists).  This gets much better when playing with the map, since then you merely have to look at it, see what's active, jump there, and use any new objects.Also, getting left over mini-game Achievements is helped since we can do them in the Extras area once the game is done.  But, HOGs and collectibles have to be done in game (which means starting over if we didn't get them the first time through).I'm not changing my rating from my initial Not Recommended, though.  I rated TFH as a just barely borderline Recommended.  But, the starting advertisement and the rating nag screen here just pushed the game over into Not Recommended territory.  However, if you liked TFH and don't mind the ads/nags, feel free to give this a try.  You might like it."
76561198141404871,Recommended,433000,22110466,"Posted: 28 March, 2016",all,joan4003,"Our intrepid Susan is back.  Twenty years have passed in the Lost Lands since the Dark Horsemen roamed the Lands causing strife and destruction, this time she has been brought to help lift a petrifying curse that reaches into her own world.  Third in Lost Lands Hidden Object series (The free to play games do not count) and by far the most complex.Storyline:  Before Maaron was born, the Druids in order to end Gorasar Conn's, the conqueror dwarf's reign agreed to pay a tribute to him and his four generals; a golden tribute, gold the Druids cursed to petrify him and his generals.  The dwarf conqueror and his generals, a harpy, a fiery golem, a minotaur and a snake woman, indeed became petrified.  The chest of cursed Druid gold was taken by Lephron Conn (leprechaun pun- lol) last of the Dwarf Priests after the defeat of the conqueror dwarf, Gorasar Conn, his brother, and he hide it where no one in the Lost Lands could find it (in the human realm).  For centuries the dwarf conqueror and his generals remained petrified until an archeologist in the human realm stumbled across the crypt of Lephron Conn and the cursed gold.  Curious, the archealogist removed a golden key and became petrified releasing the petrification spell on one of the generals, the Harpy.  Susan is brought back to the Lost Lands to undo the curse that has now affected her world and to defeat the four generals once again.Gameplay: Hidden Object interactive silhouette picture scenes, a massive find and use inventory, point and click, a huge variety of puzzles and mini-games, and the absolutely necessary fast travel map.  (Fast travel in this game is definitely encouraged and the player can ""bounce"" through all five mapped areas doing things to accomplish a single task.)Five-BN went to back to the roots of gaming by creating a huge open world minus the bottlenecks, making game progression based solely on tasks performed.  The order of the tasks is actually quite logical and linear in their progression and would be how someone confronted with the same events most likely would prioritize the tasks needed to be done.  Here is where the player is either going to hate this game or love it.As I mentioned before, this is a huge open world, and yes the player can easily collect inventory items in the first several scenes of the game that have no use until several chapters later or even the end of the game.  Now add to this the ability to know where things are but not necessarily interact with them until also late in the game.  For example, finding a box in the hollow of a tree early in the game but not being able to open it until the end of the game.  Or having a mechanical eyeball in your inventory found almost at the start and not needing it until the end of the game.  Or even seeing that item out on the lava bed but not being able to reach it until much later (when snowshoes are found).  Play on casual mode (for active locations), or use the strategy guide on hard mode, because unless one take notes or has a superb memory the player will most likely forget where something is.  There simply is that much.Then, of course, we have the fast travel map which can quite helpfully send the player ""bouncing"" through all 5 map areas and any location within that area to complete a task.  For example: Discovering rose petals are needed when standing in the Castle of Madness, Minotaur's lair.  Now where to get rose petals?  Oh yes, I planted a rose bush earlier in the game.  Where is that rosh bush again?  Hmmm..., oh yes the Cemetary, located on the Dark Lands map.  Go there get them, come back, all very simple with fast travel assuming the player remembers where the rose petals are in the first place.  This is quite common throughout the game.   Love it or hate it the whole game plays like that.Puzzles: Highlights of the game - a ""chutes and ladder"" board game played with dice, and an actual dot-to-dot puzzle.  Such fun and quite the novelty for anyone who remembers either or both.  For music ""lovers"": the music puzzles actual give the player the order of the notes BEFORE solving.  (Yeah!!)  The trick is finding the solution in the first place.  There are rotating sliders which seem twitchy but are not.  The rings lock in place when they are in the correct place with a little musical twinkle. Even with that they are still a challenge to do since they rotate backwards, as well.  Mazes, matching, logic, tangram, among other types of puzzles.  Huge variety.Hidden finds: Morphing objects, collectibles, manuscript papers and the contents of Susan's purse which can not be missed since the player finds and uses them as inventory items.  If the player manages to find all the collectibles this unlocks the Bonus Game which unlocks after the bonus chapter is completed.All Extras become are available after the bonus chapter is completed.  Extras include the Bonus Game which is ""Flow Free"" since I do not know what else to call it.  (The game where the player connects all the different colored dots without overlapping.)  There is a 20 question trivia quiz which restarts if you answer incorrectly, plus picture puzzles.  All the mini-games can also be replayed in this section.  If the player missed the achievement during gameplay the achievement can be earned in the Extra section.  (Love this feature.) Extras also include wallpapers, concept art, music, and cutscene videos.All achievements can be earned during a single playthrough.  There is one achievement that can only be earned during the bonus chapter.  Unfortunately, there are no trading cards which is a shame since the artwork and graphics are so detailed, colorful and beautiful.Highly recommend this game, the whole series in fact."

I played it to completion, aside from some voice acting issues, there wasn't a huge issue with much of anything, except one thing.They had pop ups...in the game. A PC game that I paid for. Had pop ups. And it wasn't just the 'rate this game!' popup, either. There were a couple times when I got popup ads...to other games."
,Recommended,433000,22217804,"Posted: 3 April, 2016",all,Vic=HKC=,"Susan has to save again the Lost Lands from demons that were awaken from their stone prison... because humans touched a cursed gold, found in a ancient tomb. However, she'll meet new friends, see familiar faces and visit new places...Lost Lands: The Golden Curse is the third game in the series. After saving her son from a dark overlord and defeating the Black Horsemen, Susan has to save the Lost Lands again from demons that were turned to stone centuries ago. At this point, the story seems common, however, with the new friends she's making and the fact that she'll face new enemies, it's still very well-written. As for the chapter bonus, you'll finally know what happened to Sandra, a fisher, when she was a young girl.Nothing really changed in terms of gameplay, it's still an hidden object games, though the scenes are still a silhouette one, making it hard to achieve it without misclick or under a certain time (achievements, achievements). The majority of the puzzles are easy. Also, some items can be combined or inspected to find another one.Despite not being indicated in the title, this is a collector's edition: it means that you can replay minigames, unlock the music, concept art, bonus games (puzzles), etc.. It's always nice to have some extras or more chances for achievements (concerning minigames). You even have a quizz with twenty questions to see if you did follow the story! I don't know if it's unlocking something but well, it's reminding me the questions at the end of a CSI case to earn more points.The graphics didn't change from the previous game: Susan has changed again her haircut, the Lost Lands are still full of surprises and brightful, you're even visiting a castle that could lead to madness with many problems to solve, you're visiting floating isles: one is under the snow while the majority of them are more showing a spring/summer weather... And the soundtrack didn't change too, which is also a good thing as it was good. Voice acting is also correct.The Golden Curse seemed less longer than the other games, however, the cutscenes aren't short. As you can't skip them if you want an achievement, you have to go through them.However, there is something that Five-BN should avoid. After important scenes, you have suddenly a screen asking you to rate the game (I suppose write a review here). You're under the impression to be into a mobile game. It was very annoying. Seriously, the screen popping once, I can understand. But so many times? Anyway, that's how I knew that I would enter a new chapter of the story.Lost Lands: The Golden Curse is a nice sequel, where you learn more about the Lost Lands. However, it would be nice to let Susan a little in peace and maybe have a local hero. Why not a game set in the time where the druids cursed the gold? Or why not being a young Marroon? Or maybe an adult Fiora? Why only reserve bonus chapters to locals? Anyway, if anything, the game is sold to an interesting price for a collector's edition. Go for it!"

What I personally appreciate is that you keep some things (like a knife) and use them more often instead of throwing it away after one use and trying to find one again just two minutes later.

There was a lot more back-and-forth travel than the first two games, but I never transport using the map, so this may only interest people who don't use the map for quick transport. I LOVE the ratio of puzzles to hidden object scenes. I like hidden object puzzles, but not every other scene, like in Stolen Runes Portal of Evil. The plot was not predictabe or boring, and the puzzles were challenging but doable. The graphics are incredible, as they have been in the last two games, and there are no missing sound bits nor misspelled subtitles/captions. I also really enjoy the change of scenery; I know this may sound obvious but some games have the entire map open to you from the beginning of the game, but in this trilogy, you have to discover each place, which I prefer. Overall a great game, you should definitely get it if you're a fan of the series (and if you're not!)."

The HO minigames are the 'find the silhouette' though, and while I don't care for those, they do require actions to continue the storyline which help on the puzzling bit.  If you enjoy adventure HOG and puzzles, you won't be disappointed."

76561198312721354,Recommended,433000,31496432,Posted: 1 May,all,cjvanbuskirk,"First and foremost: if you like hidden object/puzzle games, get this game. It's pretty good. Next, I really liked how the puzzles themselves are challenging, but not impossible. It is nice how you can skip them or get hints when you really need it, but you don't need them. As long as you keep calm and are patient enough to stick through it, you'll figure it out and feel  super smart for doing so. There have been times where the puzzles have been super-sensitive--you have to get it just right, otherwise you haven't really solved the puzzle. Its a little frustrating when you've lined up all the parts but its still not solved, come to find out that only needed to move this one piece a fraction of a millimeter to the left. Still, it didn't happen very often, so everything was still fun and satisfying. I highly recommend it."
