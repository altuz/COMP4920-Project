This game so far, has been a standout in the genre for me. It has just the right amount of tension and still has the survival and crafting elements that so many gamers desire these days. The visuals are stunning and it runs very smooth on my PC. My only real complaint is the annoying and plentiful rats. They are EVERYWHERE! A patch at least lowered the insane damage they initially did but they are still aggravating. If you want a tense game that looks and plays good, with plenty of places to explore, this game is for you. Especially for the price and the developers seem to listen to what people say and make positive changes.  Refreshing game to a normally stagnant genre!"

It's surprisingly well optimized for a newly released alpha and I had a lot of fun playing it.The good things:1. An excellent parkour system with great environment that makes the game fun and sometimes challenging.2. An interesting setting with a story that gets deeper as you explore and learn more.3. Great soundtrack. (Music and in-game sounds)4. Challenging enemies that are not too powerful but charging them head-on is not ideal (which so many have tried and failed).5. Awesome in-game world with secrets to discover and beautiful picturesce environment.6. A lot of game for the price.7. Updates are coming.The bad things:1. Early alpha, so you will complete what's out so far in 10 hours.2. Annoying and LOUD wheezing sound constantly playing in the background which breaks immersion (Hope it will be fixed soon).3. Minor alpha bugs.4. To be perfectly honest, the voice acting is so-so. Some good, and some a bit stale and monotone (Not horrible, but not great).This is the most fun parkour run and hide game I have ever played, highly recommended.Ps. Steam is too sensitive when &quot♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; is hearted out."

Use parkour to explore a gorgeous, tropical looking island avoiding rats, dogs and crazy cultists armed with scythes.It's a bit light on story at the moment and the mechanics are about as basic as they could possibly be, but the island is fun to explore, the premise is captivating and it has some really impressive environments visually. If you don't want to drop some dough on it at the moment, it's definitely worth keeping an eye on at the very least.Full video review:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mzkhHSZC3M"
76561198338594007,Recommended,433170,34003165,Posted: 3 August,all,thesmithsera,"So i'm barely cracking this game open, but already i'm having a blast. I would describe it as a crafting-survival/ stealth-horror game. No, you do not die from small falls or get injured. I've only died from heights where I know i'm gonna die if I miss my jump. You will have a good time if you understand this game is in alpha and is a crafting survival stealth game.You do not fight 100's of rats in the starting area and lvl up to become a wrecking machine, that does not appear to be with this game is intended to be. Instead you explore, craft, survive, sneak, hide and JUMP your way through quests. I'm in love with this game and cannot wait for more. There is nice use of music and beautiful visuals. To comment on the people that are complaining about stamina and water usage, I say OH PLEASE! I've never even been close to less than half my water supply and there are plenty of plants and other health items to recover your strength and hp. I like the fact that weapons are weak and that they break. In my opinion this game should be a little harder, but its still in alpha :)One tip: Take in the visuals and don't just ran past everything."

Why is there  no advertisement? I mean the game is quite obscured, and nobody seems to talk about it, which is a crime since the game is really well made for being an Early Access.It's basically a survival game with story, unlike most survival games i played. The game is all about exploring the island and uncover it's secrets. There are no useful weapons to kill any hostiles but you do have one important and powerful option, parkour.- The enemies in the game are really hard to kill, you need to hide and run from them.- You can craft tools and simple weapons as well as bandages and med kits.- The parkour system is excellent, which reminds me of Mirror's Edge without wall running.- The story so far is great, which is not yet complete and im looking forward to it.- The game looks beautiful and runs great on my system.This game is a steal for its price, despite being an early access game, i'm quite impressed by what i've experienced so far. Definitely got my money's worth. Im really looking forward to future updates.---------------------------------------------------My PC Spec -i5 7600K16GB RamGTX 1070 8GBWindows 10 64-bit.I run the game on Ultra settings with over 60fps."
,Recommended,433170,32209404,Posted: 5 June,all,Evil incarnate,"There are many open world survival games out there and especially on EA Steam, but I feel like this one is different from the rest because of the main concept this game carries and delivers; even at such an early stage.Starting with negatives/improvements, this game's biggest problem right now is its performance, which is a good thing. If they can sort out performance, this will be a solid experience. On my 1070 and quad core i7 3.4ghz, this game runs around 55 - 75fps with a mix of high and ultra (no AA) and with frequent micro stuttering. 75fps may seem high, but that's only achievable when in an interior looking into corners. As a 144hz user, I do expect this game to be hitting above 100fps given the graphic fidelity quality this game has. Another improvement I think can be made is having the stamina regenerate much slower because it seems like I can just rest 2 or 3 seconds after sprinting for so long, I can outrun ANYTHING that goes for me. I think the dogs/wolves should be faster than you at least. Also, the ""cling"" sound when you're spotted should be removed or changed to something more subtle and less alerting.Where this game shines are its mechanics and concept. While most EA survival games have you playing as a stock bald dude plucked from some Asset store, you play as a womanly lone survivor who is barefoot and with appropriate footstep sounds to boot - which combined, help with the immersion of a realistic world your character is reacting to. Next up, it's pretty nice how there is a somewhat storyline in such an early build, and although it most likely isn't going to win any awards it is something to work towards and there are a couple of genuinely interesting moments (so far) in the main quest that will want to get you exploring. To supplement your exploration, this game features some damn fine climbing and running mechanics similar to Mirror's Edge and Tomb Raider, whereby if you press the jump button as you're about to leap a fence, the character will seamlessly hop over it. Moreover, moving the camera around in first person as you're hanging from a rock looking for a ledge to grab feels like it's straight out of TR/Uncharted/Dying Light. Additionally, similar to Resident Evil 6, if you press the crouch button as you're running your character will slide across the floor - well animated and actually useful for diving into waist-height cover. Come to think of it actually, it would be cool if there were proper swimming mechanics implemented too.So, it's still a survival game, so you gotta collect natural resources and craft and repair items in order to keep your hunger, thirst and quest progression up. The hunger/thirst seems quite forgiving for the most part, but it doesn't really make sense that a water well would break upon first use. Having said that, recipes don't appear to be too complex and purposely bloated with useless crap in order to artificially make the game seem deeper than it actually is. No, instead, the recipes are kept simple and you can see what you have and what you need easily by opening the inventory - which is fast and efficient, by the way. It's really cool to see the inventory instantly open upon pressing the key, and having the different tabs clearly marked, and showing the character portrait to the left is a nice little touch to show you're a somebody and not a nobody. Anyway, as said, the crafting part seems relatively simple compared to other games of the same genre, but finding the parts themselves can be tricky as important resources are sparse. Having said that, you can save the game using a bonfire nonetheless, and if you die, you'll be taken back there. I'm not totally sold on this bonfire system because it goes against the design that you have to build and craft to get somewhere, so how does it make sense I can light a fire with perfectly placed wood all of a sudden? It's clear the devs just copied Dark Souls' system here but I'm afraid it probably won't end up working in the game's favour in the long run.There are quests to do but there's far too many given at one single time with a checklist of almost meaningless objectives. I mean, literally the second you exit the beginning well, you're given 4 quests with multiple objectives to do in each one. This is very overwhelming for an open world game and as such, I think you should reduce the amount of quests given at the start as well as their respective objectives, and have them show up the more the player explores. How does it make sense that I know about some coastal tower when I barely know the island I'm on?Graphics are so-so... they aren't great nor bad, but this being an alpha build, I can overlook dated graphics for now. There's options like SSAO, unspecified AA, screen space reflections and other modern post-processing that UE4 comes shipped with, and can all be turned on or off. Sound design is okay, too, and as I mentioned above having the correct footstep sounds is something I always love in games. Movies have them, cartoons have them, so should games. Your character groans and cries in pain as you're hit, she puffs as she gets lower on stamina, ""alert"" sounds are quite standard and aren't memorable with the exception of the weird sounding ""cling"" when you're spotted by an enemy. While the inventory system is slick to use, its layout is quite bland in that it looks too modern. Black bars acting as your window separator is frankly boring to look at and it doesn't fit the theme of the game.Speaking of being chased by an enemy, it's actually quite satisfying seeing that 2D depiction of your character in the lower-left corner that displays the type of action you're doing. e.g. when you crouch, it crouches, when you sprint, it sprints. This takes me back to the days of early 00s tactical shooters such as Ghost Recon. However, and I'm probably not far enough in the story to understand this, but it doesn't really seem logical that some guy wearing a bag over his head is roaming around and then chases you for whatever reason. If he's looking for you, and is meant to be the game's ""stalker"", I suggest that he remain hidden for the most part and have him leap out at you during unexpected but scripted moments. As mentioned, I can easily outrun him and it turns into a joke that this menacing guy can't even catch up to me.All in all, a surprisingly solid EA game with a few problems, but to counter-act this, has some neat tricks up its sleeves. If you're a fan of open world survival games, definitely give this a go. If you're sick of these kinds of games, stay your wallet and keep an eye on this one, because despite it falling under a common and popular genre; it offers things not many other games of this kind are doing. Sure, there's no base building, multiplayer, but I actually think this game is better off without them. It's clear the devs want to tell a personalised story, and it doesn't make much sense that an inexperienced survivor would just go around building castles like they are a mastermind architect. Please, keep base building out, and solidify your survival mechanics first. Finally, I think the maturity of this game should be stepped up. Examples would be more variety in death animations, gorier deaths both to and from the player, having the character be naked by default (like Conan Exiles), more emotional moments during key points in quests that belong to the story and generally more of an uninviting atmosphere. I want to see stuff like heads on pikes, decayed corpses in caves, vultures pecking on dead animals, this sort of thing. Right now, despite the colourful world, it feels almost too inviting and friendly in that it is just an abandoned part of this land, and not a place somebody would place their victim to trap them.Hopefully the developers will take my criticisms/improvements into account and build upon them, as well as continuing to add great new content that supports the current gameplay mechanics."
,Recommended,433170,34255870,Posted: 15 August,all,El fideo rubio,"The biggest selling point for this game is the campaign and setting.The mediterranean island is well crafted all around, giving you visual variety and good design at the same time.The parkour felt satisfing and fast which is a good combo but it could use some work on the snapping.AI is not the greatest you can outrun all enemies and when you are low on stamina you can get on top of a rock and no one will be the wiser.There is a bit of progression which consist of getting better gear new shoes that allow you to consume less stamina or cap to lessen the water reductionThe sound deparment is good my only complain is the lack of more tracks when you wander around, the voice for the main protagonist is really great but the rest fall way down, the collector npc was the worse no doubt I could even hear the microphone getting on whenever he was about to drop the line and the voice didn't match the character.I'm not going to spoil anything about the campaing but the story seems pretty interesting so far.For the price you pay you got a 7 hour game with more hours to come with every update, the game is one of the best early access I've seen in time and it's only 15€.Pros-Good level design-An original and colorful setting-Fast paced parkour-Side missions-Gear progression-Interesting story (so far)- +7hours of content (in the current version more to come as soon as updates arrive)- Cheap priceCons-AI (although it tries to be efficient it can easily be avoid by running or sitting on a rock)-Poor variety of enemies-The snaping on the parkour (it is going to cause more than one death)-Survival (it's super easy even in the hardest difficulty )-Crafting is sparse (just a few recipies)-The collector's voice (this needs to be redone)"
76561198064434403,Recommended,433170,32212251,Posted: 5 June,all,Link10103,"After seeing footage of alpha gameplay on youtube, I thought Die Young looked rather interesting. Little did I know atfer looking it up on Steam over the weekend to follow the news that it would be hitting early access in only a few days. NEAT.So far I have enjoyed myself. Havent experienced any major bugs outside of falling off a minor hill and being obliterated back to my savepoint. Literally fell off a building before and took damage but oookay GG.Die Young seems to have heavily taken from Dying Light, as in certain parkour actions looks damn near identical. Granted I dont know how varied you can get with vaulting over things and such. I do like the climbing actions alot though, in addition to a persistent stamina system while climbing things it actually seems realistic.Also, and I will freely admit I am no expert with the series, but I swear it also takes something from Metal Gear. Whenever you get detected by an enemy capable of doing real damage, theres a retro sounding blip noise. I just thought that was funny.As of now, I have only explored the Twin Houses, the Manor, and some of the Temple since if it isnt the sycthe wielding d-bag hunting me down its a bane of my existence dog chasing me to the ends of the earth trying to chomp my booty. I like it enough. Die Young, not the dog. F*ck dogs."

However it add that thrill of almost not making it, but still pulling it off. gaphics and performance is pretty good, their is some bugs and loading lag. But in genral performs nice, ive played this on both a laptop gtx960m and a desktop gtx1080. The laptop gets a pretty smooth 30fps on median. while 60fps on a gtx1080 and both have loading lag.

Basically a relaxing game untill he spots you, or the dogs, snakes and whatever else is there. Challenging at times, but not impossibly hard, good sound track and environmental sounds. Explore, hide, crouch, craft, find food and water and save points.I personally like this game alot and recommend to anyone seeking something different. Be aware though, to run in extreme, maxed out mode will require somewhat of a hefty system.I am maxed out 3440x1440 on a 34"" curved Dell monitor with only a EVGA GTX 980ti s/c (no overclocking at all), and an I7 9730x cpu with liquid cooling and the temps do reach the 40C mark.The Unreal engine 4 really makes fo gorgeous graphics. App 2hours+ into game and so far no bugs. No idea what my fps is but runs smoooth. Reminds me of hide and seek in a way. Really gets the adrenaline pumping when you are spotted and chased.

The designor choose to make your field of sight get really blurry as your character was getting dehydrated. It was frustrating as can be looking for a water source. The rats dogs and sneaky snakes kept killing me. At this point the game was 1 out of 10 - super hard blurry yucky graphics and very very tempted to ask for refund. Then at last found water , started getting feel for the jumping and the game was fun trying to figure your way around the open world.This is an incomplete game - missions with no solutions and no way to get to the tower.Overall i liked the game 6.5 out of 10, need more types of enemies and wait to see the developer to finish the game. Good potential to be a 9 but for most it will be a 3 since its not done and game is yuck till you get water source."

The Interface is great. For whole day of playing, have't experience any crashes or other technical issues. Runs quite well - I've locked it to 60 FPS from the settings - everything maxed/Epic setting with AA off, on GTX 1070 @1080p.The game is also very beautiful. The story is interesting and you need to uncover it yourself - through interaction with the world and reading the journals/maps/hints/clues you find in the game world. The Island has eerie chilling atmoshpehre. There is contrast between the sunny nature, and the occult and gory secrets you unravel. The protagonist is great and personally find her an interesting character.And it is still unfinished but at the same time it is the most complete EA game I have ever played. It feels like it will be released in a month, thats how much content it has. And they will add more as the last area is locked. I wonder what will look like when it is done.The Game DIrector is a Dark Souls fan, and you can see hints for this in the game - starting with the bonfires and that the game is actually hard and is expected from you to die :)If I can add something negative is that the wolves in the later stages of the areas look too unthreatening - they need to look more ferocious when growling.Note that the game has bugs, texture pixel lines in some places etc., indeed is unfinished, but this is early alpha build so it is expected. However, these issues will not get in your way of enjoying the game while playing. :)Oh, guys and it is indie. So buy and support it.Edit: typos."

Not if.  When.Take a Dead Island kinda visual vibe, mix it with a Far Cry collection/crafting deal, throw in a dash of Resident Evil 7 (in broad daylight), a sprinkle of Saw-style kidnapping and you've got a recipe for a great game.   Now add Dark Souls with AI that can see you from really far away and no way of knowing if you're properly hidden.That's this.And that trailer?   WTF is that?  Even though I can't recommend the game because of difficulty, that trailer is doing a disservice to this game.   It may as well be footage from a different game."

,Recommended,433170,34073159,Posted: 6 August,all,Bacchatus,"I'm not recommending this game in its current state. I'm recommending it for what it has the potential to be. It isn't a game that holds your hand. It's currently in early alpha, so the majority of the game isn't even there yet. While largely unresponsive in the community after the initial release, the developers DO listen to feedback and have made several game changing tweaks in the last couple of releases.The premise is simple. The protagonist is a young woman who is ambushed while partying on a remote island and dumped in a well. She is not John Rambo. She is not even Tropic Thunder. She is in shape, has some basic (very basic) survival knowledge and is looking for a way to bail herself out of her current circumstances.There is no watered down tutorial to get you acclimated to things. It's baptism by fire, baby. As soon as her feet hit the grass, it's live or die.The crafting system is not deep, nor should it be. The survival aspect is not deep, even though it's billed as a survival game. This is a story-driven parkour style game with some survival aspects sprinkled in to spice things up a little. It is movement and lore heavy. You will not be building shelters or crafting guns. It does take some pages out of the books of Farcry and Mad Max, but it stands on its own.It has some flaws. The wrench should never, ever break. (I think it should be removed from the game.) The combat knife should never, ever break. She should not be able to craft a wrench. A simple shiv? Sure. There is no hunger mechanic, but the devs have stated that the game is intended to be finished in a few in-game days. She may be a little peckish by the end, but she should be able to hold up. Fall damage has been tweaked.The game is visually appealing with great audio. It has limited configuration options at this point, but the basics are there. I run a solid 60fps on my mid-range machine, though I've seen complaints of stuttering severe framerate drops. I'm advising those people to check their rigs. BF2 runs great? Congrats, your AAA game with months of optimization across various chipsets runs better than this indie game that's been available on steam for just a few weeks. Not sure what that's supposed to prove.The game isn't finished, but development is very active. The first couple of hours are frustrating. But if you can muscle through that, keeping in mind that there's more to come, you'll probably enjoy this as much as I do. If nothing else, get it now before the price goes up, shelve it and pick it up again when it's closer to being finished."

The exploration of the island is also another aspect in which this game shines. In the areas available to explore theres a lot to do and explore, like finding resources and other stuff needed to craft items and along the way you find new quests to explore sites among other things.As for the story so far the setting is interesting. You play as a girl who was kidnapped and buried alive in a well and her main objective is now to get out of the island while trying to find her friends.Since this is an early access version the story hasnt progress too far yet so at this point you only get a glimpse of what it will be.As for the graphics this game is gorgeous, it only has a few texture issues but so far has been a fluid and enjoyable experience."

Layer on top of that a very crude ""survival"" system aka baby sitting your characters needs.There are better survival games out there by far so look elsewhere. Me?

,Recommended,433170,34319882,Posted: 17 August,all,DMStewart,"Tons of potential. Opens with a killer theme song. UE4 seems to work fairly well for parkour (who knew?!). It really just needs a few minor things to be polished up. Better than all CoD games ever made.My one note of critiscism is that every climbing part of the game is very similar and every one is predictable in its design. It just makes you take the absolute longest way around no matter what. Have to get to a 3rd floor? Climb up one side of the first, go all the way to the end (with excessive jumping every time), then go up one level. Go along the 2nd floor or platform all the way (the entire length) back to where you started (just one floor up). Climb up, repeat."
76561198011875318,Recommended,433170,32215737,Posted: 6 June,all,Steal,"The best way i can sum up this game; imagine a survival game, but instead of your goal just being to survive endlessly, there is actually a story to follow, however it isn't one of those stories where you're forced to pursue a linear path, you just wake up, and off you go. You discover things through exploration and slowly piece together the mysteries, i particularly like how you can't just craft everything right away, but you have to educate your protagonist by finding information on the island.This game is as much a mystery adventure game as it is a survival game.Also, it seems they understand that having to monitor your hydration is not something people want to be bothered with every twenty seconds like on other survival games, and that is much appreciated, and it allows you to really enjoy the world more.I notice some people in other reviews complaining that the enemies never stop chasing.. And this is true for those that you can't outrun; but i feel that simply comes from a lack of understanding on how the game works, you can still escape them even if they can chase you, via climbing, or standing on something they cannot access..Something i feel people fail to understand is that the game is a stealth game also, you're supposed to hide in the bushes, not run around in the open like i myself did my first time playing.You want a game where you can run around without concern, this isn't the game for you..There is potential danger around every corner.So far no bugs, and it carries what it tries to do seamlessly as far as i can tell. For early access, you can't go wrong, i highly recommend.And if i had to pick a criticism, i'd say perhaps some of the animations could be smoother, and it could probably do with less snakes."

It's fairly unique and offers some beautiful scenery, a good storyline, interresting gameplay mechanics and all for an extremely low price. I bought the game on sale and actually feel bad about not paying full price, as it's already so cheap, for what you get. LOL. Not even kidding. There are full release games on STEAM, that are quite a bit more, that are no where near as good as Die Young, IMO. Basically, you are getting a near AAA game, for $15.I read alot of reviews and read many of the negative reviews for this game and I have to say, people have a very difficuly time, in reflecting accurately, on what they are saying. Like the comparisons to the Island. IMO, this game is nothing like the Island and is far better. I have played the island for 3-4 hours. It just doesn't hold my interrest. It's too generic, not well thought out or implented. The gameplay is boring and offers nothing new. It is simply another survival clone, IMO. Where as, Die Young is pretty unique in many aspects, well thought out and very nicely implemented, into gameplay. Beautiful GFX/scenery, original local, original concept, some original aspects of gameplay, great tension, all wrapped together in a nice, neat, little package. IMO, this game does everything well.The controls are tight. The play area is already pretty big and they are adding more. The crafting is easy and intuitive. The weapons feel like something you should have, in a game like this and the breaking mechanic helps add to the over all tension. The jumping/climbing aspects are not puzzles, IMO, as they offer clearly marked paths of accension. There is no guessing where you need to go, as there would be in a puzzle. You do have to pay attention to stamina, but that just adds realism. IRL, you can't just dangle some where forever. Combat is straight forward and functions well. Dogs are actually VERY easy to kill. Probably a little too easy, IMO. Just a matter of using your brain to figure it out.Some people put down the jumping/climbing aspect, of this game. When you consider the protagonists background, extreme sport/adrenaline junky, it fits in perfectly. The people complaining about it, have very little time in the game, which means they didn't take any time to learn the basic mechanics and must rage quit very easily. The jumping/climbing adds some nice challenge, as well as some nice tension. In all honesty, there are only a couple of jumps that I did not make the first time. However, the way that saving is implemented, you simply craft a fire, before a long jump and save, so if you miss, your right at the jump, to try again.The developers are on top of it too. They add new content regularly, communicate with the community regularly, get patches and fixes out in a timely fashion and are very professional. If all devs were like these people, the gaming industry would be a totally different animal, than what it is today.This is EASILY one of the absolute best bargains on STEAM and without a doubt, hands down, one of the best games on STEAM, not just in EA. I have decades of gaming experince and this game, this game is special, unique and will be played through many times, by myself.Would I buy the game again, if I had it to do over? ABSOLUTELY, only I would have paid full price, instead of getting it on sale. Why? Because these are the type of developers that you want to support and see grow. They still have plenty of ideas to implement, into the game and I already know that, when it is done, it will be as close to being a AAA title, as a game can be, without getting the rating. In my mind, I basically got a AAA title, for less than $15. Not a bad deal in my book.Do yourself a favor and give the game a chance. I think you will be surprised, by how good it really is. I know I will actually be buying several more copies, to give out as Xmas gifts. I hope you ignore some of these reviews, just on the grounds of inaccuracies and just go with your gut. If it looks like a game that you would like, punch that ticket and take it home."

It's a survival game only in the sense that you need to pick flowers to heal and drink water occasionaly. In terms of how you ""progress"" it's like Prince of Persia (jumping) or Mirror's Edge (the bad parts). It's not scary, at least not in my time playing, and my agency was rutinely taken away to complete jumping puzzles.To clarify: The term ""jumping puzzle"" means - a series of player inputs that suspend player agency and usually involve jumping.In other words they're jumping mazes with one correct solution. They aren't neccessarily (or usually even) hard at all. You just jump, look around, jump, look around and so on.The jumping puzzles are canyoned. They're long enough to need check points. For example, half way up a building a box will fall that allows you to more quickly access the area you just jumped to. There's no thinking or problem solving involved in the jumping puzzles (at least not as far in as I got before quitting). You just look for the next place the devs want you to jump.You get to make some survival sandbox decisions BETWEEN jumping puzzles, like what order you should do them in. These sandbox mechanics accounted for about one half of my time in-game.If you haven't played a game with ""jumping puzzles"", allow me to warn you that, for me at least,  they tend to break any suspension of disbelief that you may develope from other, better, survival games. The ""island community"" appearse to have gone through a lot of trouble to make a parkour park, even taking the time to paint reachable areas white and tie red cloths to interatable wall hand holds (ALL of them - lol).This game IS shockinly well made for what it is. It looks and sounds good. If canyoned jumping puzzles are your thing, you'll probably love this. Generally, canyoned jumping puzzles have been made by really bad teams of devs. This is a canyoned jumping puzzle made by a good team. It's unique and strange in that way.On record I show more time than I actually played, since I walked away and left the game on in menu. Wish I hadn't cause I'd get a refund if I could. Sad that I didn't realize what this game is when I bought it.To the devs - please abandon the jumping puzzles entirely and you may have something here. They are outdated. IF you must include them because of some nostalgia for old bad games, please at least make them optional routes to non-vital content. Parkuor movement in a survival game is GREAT, little pieces of metal with flags tied to them from the 90's that I MUST interact with is a deal breaker for me.Finally, after playing this for about two hours, I have to say I cannot imagine this style will ever gain traction for this fundametal reason - survival games cannot be canyoned and still feel cohesive. They have to feel ""real"" with real consequences and rational atmosphere (like who the hell tied red scarves to all these pieces of metal?). Jumping puzzles have never and will never feel ""real"" since they have never BEEN and will never BE REAL.  I don't think this version of this game will ever really hit a wide demographic. How many fans of Prince of Persia enjoyed ""The Forest"" and thought, ""this needs more jumping puzzles""? I'll be shocked if it's very many.""The Forest"" is a great example of a game that has tastefully integrated climbing elements. They feel relatively natural and logical, they are short and interspersed with decision making. I'm not a fanboy (well maybe a bit - it's a good game) just pointing out an illustration of what I mean and trying to help point people to content they'll enjoy.**I've edited this review after calming down to be more helpful and less spiteful.

,Not Recommended,433170,32246683,Posted: 7 June,all,Xechasate,"I first found out about this game through the trailer on YouTube. In the video, it looked like a beautiful game with decent voice acting and an intriguing plot that would guide you through a memorable adventure.TL;DR: If you have standards and any inkling of expectations as to what an adventure/survival/open-world game should be like, don't be fooled by all these positive reviews and think twice about the purchase you're about to make.Unfortunately, I was immediately disappointed. Provided backstory is minimal and feels thrown together with lacking effort, so the character you play is all but a stranger - and an unnecessarily loud one at that, but I'll get to that point in a moment. I was expecting to delve immediately into a storyline that is well put together with depth and excitement. The lack of explanation in this game as to what's going on isn't mystery; it's poor story and game design. Aside from a few mysterious, poorly written (think back to that creative writing class you took freshman year of high school) notes lying around, like the kind you'll stumble across in many dated mediocre adventure games, there isn't any sort of information to find that drives me to continue trying to piece it together.I have a high-end gaming laptop, and while the game ran very well with no lag, that's probably because the game's graphics, even on ""EPIC"" settings, are sub-par. In 2017, gamers can expect so much more than choppy graphics, 2D effects, and low quality audio set on repeat. I did everything I could to figure out why my game looked like it did before I realized that that's just the way the graphics were made.Since I mentioned audio, let's talk about the main character's voice. In the intro I gave the voice acting a solid B+. Compared to many games, it was pretty good. But after the intro, the game developers seem to have stopped putting acceptable effort into any sort of voicing. For as much noise as this woman makes whenever she runs or jumps or climbs and moans and gasps and groans any time she needs to use muscles above her thighs, there is little to appreciate in terms of her voiced input. Sometimes when she observes things, she has (somewhat) useful observations, but they aren't voiced. Half of this game uses only subtitles, even when the voice actor had seemed so fitting! What?The AI in this game is probably the most disappointing part. Remember those early PS2 games where enemies monotonously patrolled a single path without a single change in their gate, or where they were set to wander randomly throughout a small area? That's the level of innovation applied to Die Young's AI. Stand on a boulder and you can watch dogs and rats and comically bulky men wander aimlessly in their small area, forever stuck in the same animation and never stopping to look around or do something vaguely interesting. There is no search mechanic for the enemies; as soon as you pass the invisible wall that keeps them in one area, they give up and run back to their patrol. Did I get transported back into 2004?I can see what this game is trying to achieve, and I acknowledge that it is still a pre-alpha release, but Die Young was advertised as so much more - so much better - than what it currently is. I am still curious about the story and will continue to follow the game's new content and updates, but I will do so skeptically. Currently, I regret paying $15 for a game that is actually worth at MOST about eight bucks. Even then, I would probably still ask for my money back.Speaking of... can I get a refund?"
,Not Recommended,433170,34704812,Posted: 3 September,all,TheDarkAngel,I know this game is still in development and for most part I'm enjoying it. BUT it still feels incredibly unbalanced the whole concept of save locations rather than just being able to save the game is really offputting meaning if I've invested a while and then suddenly die because a dog appears around the corner and my weapon of a stick or small stones just arent enough I lose all of my progress so will just turn the game off. You can't even punch or kick so when your stick snaps you're defensless! Controls are also a bit dodgy.

It was such a let down for me as I had very high hopes for it and was really looking forward to getting my hands on it.  The exploration and Parkour elements are incredible and make the game tolerable.  The enemies and Horrendous graphics(and they are terrible) make this game nearly unplayable.  A game like this needs to be between 50 and 60 FPS at all times and even on a high tier gaming PC I only could achieve between 28(yes you read that correctly) and sometimes during very short stints I could get 60 FPS.  Overall just bad.The game has an incredibly unbalanced and poor save system and lacks fast travel and quick save.  The inclusion of even one of these would make this game much more fun.  Flashy Trailers and Intense ""gameplay"" videos with ""cool"" music cannot mask how poor this game is.Overall Rating 3\10 and I cannot recommend it.  I cannot figure out how every review for this game is positive.  Give the developer something to work on because there is a lot of things that need to be fixed in this game.The enemies never stop chasing you...EVER!Also, if you like dying from Rats biting at your feet and want a ""wimp on an Island"" simulator, then this game is absolutely for you."
