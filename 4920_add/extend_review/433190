However the single player scramble missions are more immersive than Eve: Valk as there is more wingman ""chatter"". The graphics style is not as high quality and the style isnt quite to my taste but it is close enough and the feelings you get when blowing up enemy ships is great.I cant wait for the single player campaign though .. I hope that gets finished soon. I recommend it at least for the experience (and if you dont want to or cant buy Eve: Valkyrie, this is currently the next best thing), but it also shows a lot of promise for future implementations."

A crosshair was added for the menus and many bugs were fixed. Of course its still in a very early state, but it gets frequent updates. And it has huge potential.The game itself is an arcade Sci-fi shooter which mostly concentrates on Action. It can cause nausea but its awesome to feel like your in space, and the sense of scale is very good! the Planets are gigantic and the scenery has some great variety so you wont get bored to soon. Graphics would need some more polish but keep in mind that this is a one-man game, give him credit for that.In conclusion if you need a quick fix for space shooting in VR, this is a good game to start."

Want to go on exciting missions as a space fighter pilot?  Want to immerse yourself in a fantastically rendered, battle hardened universe, where you are a member of a topflight squad?  Then this game is for you!This may be indie, but the immersion and the gameplay are top notch!  Works great with my H.O.T.A.S  and I got totally lost in the CDF Database, looking through all the ships and space stations.  Clearly a lot of thought and love has gone into the lore and backstory for this game.The dev is approachable and is open to feedback and suggestions from the community.

Choosing weapons, managing shields etc. would be nice.But the devs seems to be on the right track.So far i prefer this a lot over the usually mentioned VR titles. 12€ well spent.Hopefully this game gains some attention."

Some of the experiences are cool but do not expect easy, plug and play for HOTAS users. Even for the supported model called out in past updates. There is no easy way to reset controls to default. You literally have to edit and delete files and pray something sticks. Most games it is within the options, yet this game requires a walkthrough for a simple reset. Unless some better user experience updates come along, HOTAS users, avoid this one for now.I edited this review due to feedback from the developer. The game itself is great and if you want regular controller support then I recommend giving it a shot and take part in a good communityt. For HOTAS users (even the TFlight stick users like myself), I cannot recommend this at this time. Dev told me this might change in the future and I will glady update this review once that happens!Edit: I realized that the support was for anolder version of the flight stick and I had the newer one. After much assistance from a community member (thanks Atlas) I was finally able to get it working and learned a bit more about controls than I ever really thought I would.

Only got into the opening training bits so far.The tutorial could be a bit better as it's not really explained how to move around at the beginning (using an Xbox One controller). I went through about 1/2 of the training missions, learning the basics before jumping off into a SCRAMBLE mode mission. The Macross/Gundam/BattlestarGalactica fan in me couldn't resist the whole ""SCRAMBLE!"" thing. Hello learning curve! Basically if a space fly veers off course and hits you, you'll be blown up! Superfly! Banzai! (+1 if you got that reference!) Well, maybe not that bad. I managed to eliminate 2 of 3 ships before dying. The gameplay itself though is good once you know what you're doing, and it looks decent enough.The menus are the usual annoying look at what you want and press a button which I could live without. I'd get it if it looked like I was in a hanger and looked at the area I wanted to go to, but that's not what this is. After completing a mission you're sent back to the start of the menus instead of where you last were.For $13, I really can't find a reason to not recommend this if you like these sorts of games. No, it doesn't feel as polished say say, Elite: Dangerous, but this is a smaller game overall, and once you figure out the controls which are poorly explained, you'll be on your way. A budget priced game that offers access to a Wing Commander like game in VR. Happy to support this!"

I use the very popular X-52 Pro and can't use it because currently CDF only works with HOTAS X whatever that is?NAILS needs to implement custom bindings for joystick rather than setting a number of preset profiles for a few select HOTAS.It took Eve Valkyrie devs a while to do this and they are a big team.  Hopefully NAILS will figure out how to implement custom mapping of controls other than xbox controller.There is another single developer game Vector 36 running on Unity engine and that lets the user assign whatever controls to any HOTAS.The other thing needed I think is better engine sound with low frequency content.  I use a body vibration system that is fed from any low frequencies in games like explosions, engine sounds etc.  The sound in cockpit is currently a bit flat.There is an increased sense of speed which is good... perhaps even more would be possible.  Elite uses star dust streaking past to give sensation of speed and the speeds look and feel higher (should be able to whizz past asteroids much quicker than currently possible).I like the improved menus and the cockpit."

I've only just bought a HOTAS (Saitek X52 Pro) and have been looking for games to use it with when using the Vive. Specifically I was really hoping for some arcade space shooters that don't also feel the need to add trading, tedious A to B ""missions"", etc.Starfighter looks to be just that and I can't wait to see where it winds up in the future.The sense of scale and very nippy crafts make this an already exhilirating experience and one to keep an eye on.There are bugs and the current custom control solution is not ideal, but check the guides to resolve this until that side of the game has been fleshed out; it's worth it to get your HOTAS working as expected.Just don't go in expecting a thoroughly polished title right now, and you won't be disappointed."

,Recommended,433190,29112484,Posted: 8 January,all,G-Dub,"For $15, this is a decent 90's style space dogfighting game for VR. Graphics are pretty good. Lots of different ship types and beautiful planet backdrops. The game was way too hard for me, but I sometimes have trouble with my depth perception IRL so that likely put me at a handicap. The feeling of flying was pretty good and the AI is a challange and there are a lot of different training scenarios and skirmishes, though no offical campaign or multiplayer yet.As others have said, the controls take a bit to get used to. On my PS4 controller, left stick is just a throttle control, and right stick moves your nose. There doesn't seem to be a way to 'roll' your ship, you just point your nose in the direction you want to go and go there, but you can't roll. I took it as a challange and just got used to piloting without rolls.TIP: Select button is what reset POV for me. Quite useful so you can play from anywhere.I suggest picking this up and if you don't find it too challanging I bet you will keep it. Especially for only $15. Nice to get in on the ground floor and support hard working devs like this."

Keeping the graphical limitations of VR in mind, the dev has done an amazing job in finding balance between realism and playability even on a 970. The flight mechanics are Arcade-style, but with enough complexity to make you think beyond point-and-shoot. No power management or newtonian physics here however. A variety of controls are supported, and the dev appears to being responsive to improving them. I use a PS4 controller and everything was mapped and ready from launch. The game modes, while straightforward, offer a good amount of content for an early access game. The Free flight and training sims are a welcome addition.  Singleplayer missions have voice acting and objectives one would expect from this type of game. Conclusion: If you are looking for a VR flight sim, this is your game.

I've not been able to do two missions in a row without an exception popup, which of course doesn't display in the Vive headset. I have to set looking at nothingness for a minute or two before taking it off to check my PC monitor.* Selecting a menu option takes you out of the VR world for a minute or more while a new scene loads up.* I've had my fighter spawn somewhere inside of a wall, rather than the docking bay. No way to reset in-game.* Controls are super twitchy with an Xbox 360 gamepad.* I often look down to see  that my ""head"" - the game camera - is misaligned with my pilot's body.

And I think you can be assured this developer is pretty dedicated to making this the best he can.I'm recommending this, but only lightly. Steam reviews are very binary, and as so often is the case, this is a ""Yes it's good but"" review.This game has a lot of potential and I can see it being fun once it's complete. The immersion is there and the VR integration is relatively solid. Probably the biggest draw of the game is the 80s/90s theming which definitely makes a difference, and you often feel like you're in the middle of a cheesy dogfight from an older sci-fi TV series. This is actually pretty refreshing in my opinion, as many other games just try and be a little too flashy and end up becoming a little bland.Graphically the game is pretty good, but much of it is likely due to the high grade engine running underneath. The GFX, such as weapons and shields, are quite nice. Ship models for the most part are detailed, and cockpits have since been updated in their textures to appear a lot more solid. It's no AAA work for sure, but it's still enjoyable to play in nonetheless. In some ways it goes towards the ""cheesy low budget sci-fi"" feel, but that's going to be subjective.Content wise it does feel a little empty. There seems to be a few missions along with a randomly generated dogfight mode, which won't keep you busy for long.There's a couple negatives though, but these are to be expected with early access titles.The game is kinda buggy right now. The AI will probably stick out the most, since it still feels very much WIP and is capable of some funky manoeuvrers like turning and accelerating instantly.The other issue is the menus- the author has tried to create a full scene with a screen in front of you for each menu. It's very pretty, and the developer has improved the menus by removing excess menus, but I still feel like the transitions between each menu takes a bit too long.My last point was the controls, specifically the apparent lack of throttle control, but since writing this review they've been touched up and are now much more enjoyable to use.Is it worth picking up now? I think if you're into space sims and have a VR headset, sure, and it's quite cheap all things considered. The developer is clearly here to stay and there's a nostalgic feel that not many games quite nail these days. However, it is of course fairly early, so if you're hoping for a complete experience right now it might be worth waiting a little longer."

Unless you like games that have horrible menu set-ups, un-intuitive controls, no HOTAS support even though it says it has HOTAS support..  I'd like to tell you about the game play, but I can't play the stupid game because it isn't recognizing my HOTAS, even though I have an X53 pro and it's listed in the menu, still isn't enough to actually work.  Waste your money on Farmsimulator or something, at least that game works as advertised."

I was an early supporter of it and spent money on it early on when there were just a few levels.  I flew around them, shot up stuff, had a good time with the game.  The first time I looked out my window and saw my cannons on the wing was one of my coolest VR moments thus far.That said..The controls are just a mess in the most recent update.  I don't know how you can neglect support for an Xbox 360 controller which much of the population still owns.  When I first purchased it played fine with a 360 controller, but 6 months later things have gone all to hell.   For some reason the game wants to default to keyboard buttons for my ship controls (my 360 controller works fine on every other VR game I have) instead of my 360 gamepad.  I had to go into custom controls to fix, and when back in the game, my ship spins like a damn top and the controls are all out of whack.  Left is right, right is left, up is down, down is up, and then I puke.  I have no other controls plugged into my USB.  This is running Windows 7 64 bit with most recent updates and 360 controller driver installed.I gave up on trying to even get my starfighter out of the docking bay.  I've come to the conclusion that it's a lost cause.And the menus?  They remain a nuisance with a gamepad after 6 months.  I've never seen a game where the cursor will skip options like it does in this one.  And it does it continuously.  I can't tell you how many times I've had to sit there and wiggle with the analog stick over the same area 6-7 times trying to hit the hotspot on an option button.  Same with the d-pad; it cannot see the hotspots.  The cursor just cannot see some of the hotspots half of the time when in the menus.I'm a developer myself and can appreciate the work required for a game of this magnitude, but there's no way that this far into development there should be controls issues like this with one of the most popular gamepads in the PC market.  I'm not playing this with a 9.99$ controller made in Bangladesh; I'm playing this with a freaking Microsoft Xbox 360 gamepad.  And it doesn't work.  And every other VR game I have works with it fine.That's inexcusable."

It ALWAYS inverts the right stick....so my forward thrust is now pushing back on the stick.Boost still doesn't work unless you hold down forward thrust....but it plays an animation of dust particles flying past your window faster.  You need 2 thumbs on each hand to control this game has intendend.The menu screens are nice, but try navigating between option screens (and the various rooms you're in) you quickly get bored of the slow fade to black and wait states between each room.Put the menu on one screen."

,Not Recommended,433190,34051188,Posted: 5 August,all,pxlFkr,Wow - REALLY wanted to like it - but like everyone else says none of the controls work - xbox controller nor X52 Pro. Extremely buggy - got into the cockpit once and it looks super promising - but the controls stopped working. Rebooted several times - works - then stops working. Really buggy. Switched to Hotas in menu - then nothing worked and can't get anything to happen. Looks like the dev abandoned it. Shame. Could have been awesome. Waste of time and money for now.

Seriously why are the controls so effed? And why when you change the button layout is there NOT a return to ""Default"" button? This last item would make things so much easier. I accidently changed the y-axis controls on my controller, and then had to wade through a bunch of appdata files to fix it. I thought, WHY? If the Dev isn't going to take the time to but in a default button, then why do I need to take the time with this game? Refunded. There are better titles on here for space fights, go play them."

UI is very bold and modeling is vary basic.  pretty much a tech demo in range of giving it a range in level of quality.  But defenatly there is other game sim in VR better than this one. House of the Dying Sun and especially Elite Dangerous is one of them who can call them a full game.

I did wait for a couple of updates and give this game a chance, sadly I don't want to hang on too long and be beyond a refund.Edited , looks like the devs have been working hard on updates for the HOTAS issues, I haven't had the cash in my steam wallet to buy the game back yet, but will be back to edit this review once I have tried it again and hopefully it will be positive :)"

You point with your head the menu items you want to select, except some of them are placed in a way where my chin touches my chest and I am curled forward only to reach them. Very uncomfortable.Also some HUD items are hard to see / unreadable because font is too small for resolution of the vive.But mainly it's so dark I can't see anything in so many areas. Instead of being amazed at a large capital ship, or that I am flying in space, or even trying to dock back in, there are so many unlight areas where it's pitch black except for the odd light here and there that does not produce any light to its surroundings but rather just a blinding spot of color.This is immediately apparent in the first tutorial where you're inside something but you can't really tell what it is, and then when you are navigating back trying to dock into the capital ship there are huge areas of said ship that are just black holes of nothingness."
