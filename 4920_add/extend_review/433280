,Recommended,433280,20689827,"Posted: 22 January, 2016",all,Aurumlamina,"An absolutely incredible RTS with heavy RPG elements, Warlords Battlecry III is still one of my favorite games to this day.  With almost a dozen and a half well-balanced races to choose from, the replayability value is absolutely insane and every race has several viable strategies that will work to use their strengths against their opponents' weaknesses.  Creating your leader, a hero, is also extremely rewarding from the nearly infinite number of builds that you could create.The gameplay and story are a worthy pairing for the mechanics even if it does sound somewhat familiar to that of a standard adventure RPG cliche.  A great evil is rising and threatens to overtake the world.  Your chosen faction is determined to defeat it and, through your choices, you will make many allies and enemies of the other factions as you travel throughout the world accomplishing what you must to do so.  The world map is interesting with lore behind every location and tons and tons of content to explore as the game is very non-linear.  Combat is also a fun experience where each faction's strengths and weaknesses can be used to your advantage.  Each faction has its own unique units and buildings as well as its own level of priority for the four resources of the game.  For example, the Dwarves faction uses a ton of metal, the Daemons are heavily based on stone and crystal, and the Empire prioritizes gold, though, each of these factions will find itself needed at least a little of these key resources to truly build a respectable army.Your faction, whether you choose a fantasy classic like the Knights or Dark Elves, or a more unique one like the disease-carrying Plague Lords, or the lizardman-like Ssrathi, is an absolute blast to play.  Each has a list of armies and buildings that are almost entirely different from the other races as well as a separate tech tree.  Your hero, however, is the ultimate icing on the cake in my opinion.  With sixteen races and twenty-eight classes to choose from you could never tire of trying out different combinations to create vastly different heroes.  Each race provides six skills for you hero and each class does the same.  Each level that you achieve in the game provides you with a point to improve these skills and further improve and specialize your build.I would recommend this game to all RTS fans as well as those who love fantasy RPGs.  This is a great game that to this day I don't tire of.  I purchased it instantly as soon as I saw it on Steam and wanted to get the word out that it is an absolute gem!"

I played it back before it was on steam (and eventually lost my copy, and was so excited that I immediately bought three copies for me and others.)It has more races than any other RTS I've seen.It has more resources than any other RTS I've seen.It has heros, it has leveling, and it has dragons.It's also the only game I've seen that makes the phrase, ""Spring is in the air!"" send shivers of fear for your imminant doom down your spine."
76561198026070142,Recommended,433280,20740165,"Posted: 24 January, 2016",all,Herr Chooban (Kookamachi),"Here's the short version of my review: This game came out well after the groundbreaking RTS Warcraft III: reign of Chaos, but it represents an independent creator's attempt at perfecting his craft and coming up with some brilliant mechanics along the way. This is in my opinion one of the all time greats for real time strategy because of its bold hybrid nature, original soundtrack and voice acting, and ahead of its time mechanics. This is the very definition of a cult classic video game.Here's the long version: This game has an incredible number of stream lined RTS features that put it WAY beyond its time in terms of utility and functionality. Resource gathering is a little similar to that found in a Relic RTS (CoH or dawn of war) in that resources are based on ""territory"" capture (I put in quotes because the resource buildings must be captured by either your hero or one of his generals).  Buildings had the ability to set continuous production on any pattern of units or upgrades you wanted. Each unit can be set to behave according to a huge number of AI scripts including scout/rampage (useful in the age-old RTS conundrum of when your opponent is hiding one villager somewhere on the map with a secret little building and you dont want to have to search endlessly).Above all else is the ability to make a persistent hero with his own posse of regular ole soldiers who rise above the ranks and stick with you above and beyond battles. This concept is what got me into this game in the first place and its something that saddens me to not have found its way into any other RTS's (that I know of).The heroes are many and their abilities are interesting but one of the things I was not a big fan of when I first played the game was the plot driven campaign (I always liked Warlords Battlecry II's Total War style campaign map). I did warm up to this later on and I now view it as an improvement.Whats further incredible about this game is the sheer number of sides with very unique mechanics for each one. There is a side for everyone to take up and enjoy. (Undead take little wimpy skelemen and turn them into apocalyptic harbingers of death... dark dwarves can use their engineers to build massive siege buildings... There's an entire race of fairy people that were extremely broken but seriously who would stoop so low as to play as a giant race of pixies?) Most of all, each side has a unique feel that is spot on.There are a ton of other features that I often miss when I play other RTS's as well but I only wanted to highlight my favorites.In conclusion this niche classic is a fantastic time killer and quite a bit of fun. Whenever I look at spending money on a game I ask myself how many subway sandwiches is this thing worth? Is Warlords Battlecry 3 worth two subway sandwiches? Absolutely. I mean seriously. I eat subway sandwiches and then poop them out. This gave me hours of entertainment just now. I started writing this. Played like 6 missions in the campaign and enjoyed it a great deal. Easily worth 10 bucks. Buy the game. Maybe they'll make WBC IV someday. Maybe."

This is a very good RTS-RPG on all levels with a huge amount of content, but it is simply very generic in its theme, that's all.It's not even generic in a bad way, it just has all the classic units and races you'd expect or want.The weakest part of the game overall is probably the graphics which were not that great when it came out in the first place, some units also feel a bit out of place graphically when you take the art themes into account, sort of like when units are added with a mod and they don't look like the same person made them.Oh, and it would be best if you didn't buy this for the MP, I'm not sure what sort of hoops you're going to need to jump through to get it working."
76561198170785126,Recommended,433280,31895479,Posted: 21 May,all,Vyrrh,"It's fun. Unbalanced, but fun. Actually, taking Balance out of the equation is probably what makes it fun. How many RTS games do you know where you only get three factions and there's not really much that sets them apart? The factions in this game have completely different playstyles, advantages, and disadvantages. Knights have good cavalry, but electricity and flyers can make their lives hell. Anything that isn't elven has access to siege equipment, with Dark Dwarves getting the cool stuff. You can be snake-people, plague-bearing abominations with hydras, Conan The Barbarians, minotaurs, Undead Humans, Knights, Humans-that-aren't-knights-or-barbarians (they get mages but are kind of boring), fey-cretins, grossly misinterpreted orcs (it says those units are kobolds and gnolls, but they do not look like it), and daemons for maximum edge in case DarkSpiderElves wasn't edgy enough.Your hero unit can be of a race separate from the Faction you play as, and you can make Dumb things like a daemonic paladin, or a fey Dragonslayer, or you can play an archetype straight. It progresses like an RPG character, slowly growing in power as it wins fights. Advancement is simple enough to be done mid-battle, and if you're a trickster, you can use the lairs on maps that spawn NPCs that are hostile to everyone at regular intervals to farm EXP for you or your troops, or destroy them to release a Very Powerful Unit close to an enemy base.The graphics are two dimensional, polished-up versions of the original game's sprites. So, they're dated. Not to the point that you should be unable to tell what you're looking at (in most cases), but enough to have that constant air of cheesiness about it. But the cheese is good! Most of the time, anyway.The campaign is more RPG than RTS. You're sailing on a ship when a Portal To Hell opens up on some island, and it turns out something is trying to escape the portal in order to go wreak havoc upon The World, and for some reason it's your job to stop it. Bland stuff, nothing really groundbreaking in terms of plot, but it's fun for what it is. Just watch out for when the campaign randomly decides to throw a lvl 75 hero at you when you're barely lvl 20.It's important to switch on Compatability mode on any computer that isn't a complete dinosaur, and maybe downgrade the version a bit to the last official release if you aren't digging the setup that got released here that is riddled with text popups about how your buildings are being converted that'll make you wonder if a thirteen-year-old modded this for the re-release. Easy enough fix with the proper files.My only real criticism apart from some of the design oversights is that, if you want to play as a female, your only real options are humans or elves. No lizard women or daemon women, no zamby women, no plaguemonster women, no minot- wait not having minotauresses kinda makes sense. I've seen Kung Pow: cows are either OP or have a glaring weak point. There is no middle ground.Vee's Rating: It's as good as any generic fantasy is going to be, but with knight-druidesses and their harems of dryad-chicks and crazy fiery salamanders and succubi. Good cartoon, dumb fun, would watch more of."

However, I really can't recommend this version of the game at all as it includes fan patches that not only fix the bugs but also change the gameplay drastically.Scroll down for what I said when I thought this was the official version and what I'd restore along with a recommendation if it is reverted to the official version.It's like having a reunion with a long lost childhood friend, only to find that, during our long separation, aliens have abducted him, experimented on him and gave him an extensive modification before letting him go. While these modifications are, according to the aliens, improvement, the person is no longer your childhood friend but a total stranger wearing your friend's face.So, if you've played the official version and is planning on getting this for nostalgia's sake you should at least find out what the fan patch changes and decide whether or not you could live with it.Original ReviewNote that I'll be approaching this game from a(n extremely) nostalgic point of view.The moment I saw this game on steam, the first thing I was checking if my eyes were deceiving me.And when I could confirm that it is really here, I bought it without any hesitation.This game literally is my childhood. While it is certainly not the first RTS I've ever played, It's certainly what instill the love of the genre in me.On to the game itself, there are two features which, to me, give this game the charm that even modern RTSs couldn't match; the hero system and the races.There are 16 races in this game and all of them are almost completely unique (there're a few units that turn up in more than one races, like peasants, the builder unit for both Knights and Empire). While this introduce some balance problems (like how the Orcs have limited anti air capabilities while the Demons have air superiority, which will put Orcs at a disadvantage should the two races are put to fight each other), the variety results in an almost endless strategic possibilities and is like a playground for a child's imagination. Even as an adult, I still sometimes think back to the days before I lost the disc and imagine how the races interact with another. There're few games that let war elephants duke it out with a freaking T-rex (yes, there are T-rexes in this game, and it's almost worth buying just for them alone).And now for the hero system, instead of playing separate battles and begin anew every time, you create persistent heroes (which you can choose from all the sixteen races and twenty eight classes, in an almost RPG-like system) and have them, and their retinue of hand-picked troops, leading the battles. While this, again, creates balance problems (as a level 50+ hero could probably stemroll an entire base lead by a level 1 hero, even though there are temporary heroes and no heroes mode designed to avoid that), it also leads to a very satisfyinng gameplay as you build your hero up, finding new gears and gaining new abilities and more overpowered retinues. The system let you immerse yourself in your hero's journey and exercise your imagination. Even after many, many year, I still remember fondly my favourite hero, a Ssrathi (basically half man, half snake) Paladin, equally skilled in close combat and healing Magic, bodyguarded by a T-rex, a Minotaur King (who is as tall as the T-rex), a Knight Lord, a High Elven Moonguard and a white dragon. Isn't that awesome? That's the kind of experience this game gives. And of course, ther're so many other builds out there that could satisfy basically any idea.The game isn't without its flaw and even its huge fan like me acknowledges that. It seems to focus on diversity of builds and strategies rather than balance, the point I've already brought up (twice). And the graphic is pretty old even in 2004 (when it came out) and is completely outdated in 2016. Still, if you can get past that and you like RTSs, RPGs or a great mix of both, I believe this game will satisfy your need and your imagination quite nicely."

The 'heroes' in WarCraft 3 don't even come close.Unfortunately, the steam version of this game uses the player-made patches which, in my opinion, are inferior to the official patches. It's because of this that summoned troops have cooldowns and the game breaks emersion by talking about ♥♥♥♥♥es when your buildings are being claimed.Sad.

I enjoyed the combat mechanics to a degree and loved the idea of retaining troops and a hero after each map. This game brings more of the same and then some. That is to say, the same sprites that were used in the first and second games make an appearance here in the third game as well.The leveling mechanic in Warlords Battlecry 3 is done right. Your hero gains experience as the match goes on and can even level during the match (something that could not be done in the first one). Tons of classes and races allow for moderate choices which can dramatically alter your game play.The varying abilities that are available for warlords to take can alter everything. Abilities like Engineer make your building have more hp (think tower defense), while merchant lowers the price of all units universally (good for swarm tactics). Abilities like constitution make warrior warlords a pain, while specific classes such as pyromancy can make enemy warlords dangerous. A well built warlord can take down an army in the blink of an eye, as long you carefully watch the battle unfold.If the Hero concept does not sell the game to you, then maybe the races will. There are 16 different races, each with unique troops and abilities to really add variety and replayability. Although some units are shared by races, you'll be impressed with the selection given here! To add to this, each race has a unique titan that can really change the tide of battle.Titans are units that can only be built near end match when most upgrades have been researched. After it is available, it takes a while to build and if it dies, its gone for the match. However, Titans can mow down armies without flinching, provided they don't get overwhelmed! (If you don't like this concept there is an option to turn this off, but why would you?)Finally, the campaign is truly something to behold. Loads of side missions and ambushes add for a significant amount of reputability. The mainline of the campaign is not all that exciting and ends quickly but the significant amount of side mission will more than make up for the weakness of the mainline in the campaign. The missions are also quite varied too. Tournament pitting you Warlord vs others as well as defense missions and elimination missions leave the campaign quite varied.Although my overall view of this game is highly positive, I would be boldly lying if I did not say there were problems with the game as well. Bugs that were very annoying in the first game have made a return here. I experienced an average of ""1 crash every hour"", but most came from multiplayer. I am unsure if what was causing the issues but it was a problem for both Windows 8 and 10. Low max resolution can be a little annoying to some as well (although it didn't bother me at all).The most important problem by far though is the AI in Warlords Battlecry series. Sometimes you will start a match and the AI will be vicious. They will quickly swarm you and be relentless for quite some time, even on easy difficulty. This can be fun at times but frustrating as well. Other times, The AI will suddenly refuse to continue on and just give up or make baffling mistakes. I watched the AI walk a Titan into a field of towers and let it die. Afterwards, maybe 10 minutes later, it brought an army that wiped the board in seconds without losing many casualties. The AI also makes VERY bad decisions with their Warlords which will handicap them (but to a lesser extent). Suffice it to say that the AI is definitely passable and a capable challenge, but could benefit from a little work.The good+ Warlords+ Retinue of generals+ Loads of varying Classes+ Loads of different Races+ Titans add a new level of combat+ More fleshed out mechanics+ Building art style is nice+ Soundtrack is decent (and easily modifiable if you want to make a custom soundtrack)The Bad- Still filled with some annoying bugs- Crashes are horribly common (I would go hours without having one, then have 3 in 10 minutes)- Random AI can sometimes be REALLY hard or REALLY easy.- At times, maps are not optimized for the AI to understand. (Some maps cause the AI to become brain dead)- Max resolution is 1280x1024 (which you get used to quickly but still should have higher resolution available)- The fan made patches for this game are forcefully implemented here. (It is obvious that Steam and GOG did not spend any time playing the game as one mod adds a silly profane comment when building conversion occurs.) This is not a deal breaker, especially with this game, but I hate when stuff like this happens. I want the option to mod me vanilla game, not be given a premoded version.Overall, I give this game a 9/10 and recommend it for Warlords series fans. Its a good strategy game for anyone but its massive compilation of Warlords units (especially from Warlords 4) was awesome. This game is rough around the edges and some support would really help smooth out the problems. None of the problems I encountered were ever bad enough to make me upset with the game.

,Recommended,433280,30524153,Posted: 15 March,all,Aron,"From the series I have only played Warlords Battlecry III, but it is a big favorite of mine nevertheless.The RTS SideAs you probably know, Warlords Battlecry III is a Real Time Strategy (RTS) game, just like the Age Of ___ games or Starcraft, Warcraft. What makes it unique is its large amount of races to play with - 16 to be exact - from Elves to Dwarves, Minotaurs, Daemons, different reptiles, etc.There is a conversion mechanism for buildings - some units can perform aconvertaction which will turn nearby buildings to the player's side. This is how the resources (Gold, Crystal, Metal and Stone) are handled - you have to convert the mines which will produce for you.The RPG SideA neat feature in Warlords Battlecry III is that the player has their own hero, a superunit who stays with the player between battles and gains experience to level up. There is a huge list of classes to pick for the Hero, such as Merchant, Dragonslayer, Pyromancer, etc.Heroes can learn spells in many different spell schools - Alchemy, Chaos, Divination, Nature, Poison, Necromancy, and of course the basic ones like Fire or Ice. Additionally, Heroes have an Equipment and Inventory system - with Set items to collect too.The Gameplay SideWarlords Battlecry III offers a Campaign Mode to take on with a unique storyline.The player can take their hero to independent battles in Skirmish Mode and play on either randomly generated or manual maps with up to 5 AIs.Lastly, there is an Editor in which the player can assemble their own maps.Last WordsRTS + RPG, perfectly falls in a good old game category. Definitely recommended."

Even today Warlords Battlecry 3 has a lot to offer to the real time strategy genre, even if at moments the implementation is a little sloppy. It has a ton of races to choose from, and a persistent hero unit you can bring from game to game as well as units you can level up and put into your retinue to also bring from game to game(if they die they are dead forever though, unlike your hero unless you choose ironman mode).

I've experienced other odd, one-off bugs from time to time, like being declared victorious when the enemy kills my hero instead of other way 'round, and unusual unit behavior occasionally.  But I was such a huge, drooling fanboy of WBII, which sadly is not offered on Steam, that I had to pick up WBIII for 10 bucks.  It's not all that different from WBII and still contains all the elements that made the original great: persistent heroes, different races to lead (with genuine differences in gameplay), towers that you can occupy to make them stronger (wish AOE had that), and no-fuss resource gathering which again you can strengthen permanently by adding workers (though ""permanent"" assumes the enemy won't convert your resource).  There is also some really good assignable AI for your units, with an unusually large number of choices, from RAMPANT (stomp around the map attacking everything) to GUARD to FALLBACK 25% HEALTH and PATROL and so many more.  The only time the game really gets fidgety is when the enemy and you keep converting the same set of resources over and over and over, at which point you really have to just break the cycle and start making advanced units to go wipe him out.TL;DR?A really good RTS in its day, with some unique features that make it still a blast to play.  This version is fan-modded and sometimes quirky, sometimes buggy.  For $10 it was a no-brainer for me, but modern gamers with no history wth the game may find it quaint and dated."

I have yet to play the Campaign mode as well but if it adds a story to the already intriguing system of leveling up and building then I'm all for it.I'd give this game a solid 7/10 due to the fact that the game is a bit unrefined at times with units not following today's standards of pathfinding along with some clunkiness with the AI, and lastly an Ironman Mode feature that apparently has not worked for a while.

For anyone who was around for the original Warlords BC series, this was the pinnacle of their game system.  Some might say that WBC 2 was the most interesting in terms of character building and campaign, but this one stands in contrast to that one in the freedom it offers.The freedom is almost overwhelming at first.  Which race/class combination to choose?  Because you can choose any of any.  Undead paladin?  Fey Necromancer?  Orcish Merchant?  All doable.  It stokes the imagination.However, the graphics and ui haven't aged well.  Other modern games do it better.  You can't play in windowed mode, for instance, though if you set up your monitor a certain way, it won't stretch the graphics on a wide screen.  The art style isn't bad, per se.  It's very colorful in contrast to former entries to the series.  And the number of effects are pretty satisfying to look at if you're able to look at them through nostalgia glasses (provided you've been around long enough to be nostalgic.).Anyway, I still say this is the best of the mid-late nineties early 2000's RTS genre.  It's the pinnacle of all the warcraft and starcraft.  And to boot, you get a hero that persists through all your battles.  It's fun having that continuity in a game of this kind."

These changes have re-balanced many of the units and heroes to suit more of an arena style of play. For an actual change log you would have go to the site in order to see the full list.This is one of the best RTS games of it's time and although the graphics have aged quite a bit it allowed you to greatly customise your hero and allow many different tactics to be used with each team. There are a total of 16 different races (some better against others) and a large game world to explore in a series of skirmishes or short missions. The major focus was on the hero and it's development in the game which race or races would it lead into battle, what are it's skills going to be and what equipment their was. While it is possible to play the game without heroes there was also no limit to their development. Races are not balanced or set to a specific play style you will need to use different tactics to stand a chance when faced with a racial mismatch but the game is almost always win-able.The unofficial patch heroes for example have had many of their abilities changed to empower warrior type characters. New spell sets have been added and mage abilities changed to better suit the method of the modders. Summons are the most noticeable difference as you now have a limited duration on units that would likely have died due to a lack of healing from your team. The magic system in short has been altered to prevent some tactics and give others a chance if they unload all their spells at once a much harder system for people to learn.Most units from what I can remember from the original have had at least one value changed from cost to massive increases to health, armor or damage. This isn't a small change either with some of them getting double health or similar changes. The result is an over developed patched version of a game that was good by itself.Unfortunately it seems to be a case of if it ain't broken why fix it. The game is less friendly than the original for new people and many older players want their classic game back. You could call this Warlords Battlecry 4 for all the changes they have done but they aren't good ones. Play the version you want and try the 1.30B patch in compadibility mode before you judge the game."

Grinding away at a normal pace without risk is only fun for a short period of time. Retroism support told me that this is known issue and that there is no fix for it at this time. The game is only playable until you complete the campaign, then it loses flavor."

Right back in my childhood, and I couldn't wait to kill some snakemen again. Unfortunately, when I bought, downloaded, and ran the game, I learned that Skirmish mode (you vs AI) doesn't work at all, and saving games and heroes is also impossible making the game itself completely worthless. Even worse, I spent all day yesterday playing through the campaign only to save my game, and come back to nothing. 16.ish hours right down the drain. I'm requesting a refund."

To be quite honest it's a huge disappointement."

The link will be posted below.This game was a basic copy-paste with NO upgrades to be had to moderrnize it for newer systems. YOU ONLY HAVE 3 RESOLUTION OPTIONS:800x6001024x9681280x1024THATS IT!!Now, I do have to say that it was like curling up with a blanket on a rainy day and reading one of your old favorite novels with a glass of warm brandy and a nice wood fire to keep you company.... BUUUUUUUTTTTT.........The game’s asking price after the initial release discount has gone away is $10 US. And I do have to say that it felt good to play around with an old-style RTS like this again. However, given the current price tags of other RTS’s that have more interesting story, better graphics, and more modern mechanics… I would have to say to give this one a pass guys.. At LEAST until there’s a steam sale or the price gets cut roughly in half.You can see my full review here:https://youtu.be/2TJPjS0f3pE"
,Not Recommended,433280,31500032,Posted: 1 May,all,Cybot,"this game is so bad, I regret buying it.The first titel was the best IMHO.The so called ""unofficial"" patch is making this game hell.I don't know why, but you get killed so fast by assasination then intented, by mere kobolts!!! (3 gobs comming your way? you don't have a Warrior class hero? well say byebye Hero)the summoner limit is also a downgrade, magic overall is, Item ""balances"" are also crap.There is only english audio not multilang how it supposed to be. I even bought this game as a hardcopy for the same money and got what I wanted, a good game without ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""fixes and balances"""

This game would struggle to look good next to Warcraft when it was first released. Of course that would mean nothing if the gameplay holds up but it failed to draw in me in at all. This game may have its fans that it boasts about, but I will not be one of them."

One will affect another. Help the Elfs or Kill them.Cons:Graphics but who cares. Gameplay is what matters.

I could even import my old hero from the original version with no problems!  My only complaint is that they added time limits to summoned creatures, which makes my hero (a level 41 Summoner) a bit weaker, seeing as the level 5 Daemons she summons only last for about a minute and a half or so (haven't timed it to be sure, but that's what it feels like).  It definitely gets a solid 4/5!"
