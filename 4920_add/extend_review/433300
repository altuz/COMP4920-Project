It's got some great elements going for it, the stuff that drew me in when I was first playing are still there- the choice of characters, the gameplay, and the general feel of the game overall are still superb.However... DO NOT BUY THIS GAME AT FULL PRICE.The controller support is ABYSMAL. It took me admittedly WAY too long to find out that the button mapping IS NOT WHAT IT SAYS IT IS IN GAME. My Xbox controller (which is the one they have it built to use) was not able to be used properly for the game. For example: pressing the ""a"" button would give me a different input than what I desired. To actually press ""a"" in game, I would have to press the ""x"" button. To pause the game, I had to click in the right analog stick. It's a very messed up control scheme that leads to way too much confusion in a game that relies heavily on quick action.I was lead to use the keyboard controls, which felt clunky, slow, and inaccurate. This only further cemented how improperly this game was ported.The graphics weren't updated much, if at all, which quite frankly, is disappointing. I'd have hoped they'd have reworked the whole engine to make it look and feel better, but it's fair that they wouldn't want to spend a bunch of money on it. However, this is just horrible. The game still doesn't look bad, and ran smoothly at a constant 60FPS at 1920x1080. It however, is not new or cutting edge- still very PS2/Xbox era.Overall I'm quite disappointed here. At $40 the price is WAY too high. I'd have been okay with getting to relive my hours of gameplay for $10-$15, but with this poor quality and irresponsibility, I feel that I have to say this is a no-go. Please wait on this to see if it's updated and fixed at any point, because it's just hurtful as of now.Puddle of mess that you stepped in on your way to the store: 3/10"

If nothing else, I figured a nice graphics update would suffice and hopefully a game engine update would follow.  Since I modded the original game a ton, this new release got me interested because of the amazing new possibilities.Except not.  This game is amazing in itself, but the port is a total dumpster fire.  The day of release, controller support did not work properly at all.  With any form of Xinput type controllers, button mappings were either♥♥♥♥♥backwards (""A"" was really ""X"", ""Start"" was really ""R3"", etc) or not functional whatsoever.  I had a hell of a time even getting passed the initial start menu.  When I got in game, I couldn't swap characters at all.  I couldn't use powers.  I went to the Options menu, and I couldn't even rebind any keys or buttons whatsoever.  For Direct input, the compatibility was stripped from the game all together.  This is especially stupid since the original MUA1 release for PC had it.The UI is just a polished turd with a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥coat of paint on it.  The ""Options"" menu should be renamed ""Lack of Options"" menu because every meaningful option was stripped out.  Graphics settings can be summarized up in 3 words:  Low, Medium, or High.  What?Everything about this port is totally garbage, which is extremely frustrating because it was already released on PC before in a perfectly working condition.  All they would have had to do was update that version.  Instead Zoe Mode chose to port a console version (it looks like the 360 version), and then♥♥♥♥♥♥on it.  This game obviously never went through QA because even the initial start menu doesn't work properly.  Or maybe it did go through QA, and the quality they were shooting for is &quot♥♥♥♥♥♥poor"", hoping we would say ""♥♥♥♥ this"" and just go buy the console version instead.No original DLC, lack of options, no ability to rebind controls, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controller support at best.  I refunded this game immediately.  Unfortunately, shortly after I was told there was a patch that supposedly fixed all the issues. Some people even say the controls are working now.  So, me being a dumb fan and believing them, decided to go ahead and repurchase the game and get the patch.  The patch fixed almost nothing.  I use a Logitech F710 wireless gamepad which emulates a wireless Xbox 360 controller and works flawlessly in every single other game that supports Xbox controller... except for this one, because unfortunately this port is bad, and Activision should feel bad even releasing it at all.  I mean how could you POSSIBLY ♥♥♥♥ up controller support when this port was from a CONSOLE version of the game SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED to run on controller?To be quite honest, even Arkham Knight wasn't this much of a blatant cluster ♥♥♥♥ on release.  There is no excuse to release a 10 year old game with no DLC, no true remastering, no graphics or gameplay updates, no way to customize controls, and no way to actually ♥♥♥♥ing play it and charge $40 for it.  I mean they even ♥♥♥♥ed up trying to take the lazy way out.  Instead of just re-releasing the original PC version, they ported an old console version.  So they did more work trying to do less.  If Zoe Mode isn't out of business by next week, then something is terribly wrong because they suck.  I normally don't trash devs this hard or support people losing their jobs, but if there is one company that deserves to fold over this nonsense it is the developer who made this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port of this amazing game.If you want to experience this game for the amazing game it truly is, please buy the original PC release.  Go to the Marvelmods forum and get some awesome mods for it as well.  I'm one of the original modders there, so you won't be disappointed.  If you want to experience this game for the complete♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of a port it is, then stick with the Steam version.  But don't say I didn't warn you."

(My understanding was this had to be patched.  Also note that I can't speak to the quality of the mouse and keyboard controls, but since it is a port I'd expect they aren't amazing)-No crashes-No bad audio issuesIt plays how I remember it playing on the xbox 360.It doesn't offer anything new, but if you play with 360 controller you too can recreate fond memories of a heroic beat-em-up now on your PC.I've also played some in Ultimate Alliance 2 and my assement of that is the same as this."

All of them are still definitely my favorite style of co-op games, ireallyappreciated how each player can pick a character to match their own playstyle.You feel like hanging back and blasting fools from a distance with projectiles? Done.Wanna mow through 'em one by one like a tank? Go for it.Oh, you prefer to stick to the skies and rain down haymakers? No problemo!The flexibility in how you approached each stage was (and still is) awesome, countless hours were spent playing through the story with different combinations of teams and it was cool to see how certain team combos were given boosts i.e. Fantastic Four, Avengers, X-men etc.Unfortunately, when it comes to this port on Steam, i'm just not interested in spending more hours than the few that i already have on an otherwise great game... as you will see in other reviews, controllers are virtually un-usable due to the button mapping. The fact that the game is still being offered for purchase with this major issue is insulting to the series and to the community. It's like expecting people to pay for a car that they can barely drive and having no issues with selling such a sub-par product... even on a sale it's questionnable.I hope that Steam will increase their standards for what they allow to be sold on here. With this major issue, it would make more sense that you tell the publisher to fix it with a patch or otherwise remove it from the store completely if they fail to do so within a given time. In its current state, it's honestly not doing anyone any good, and hasn't been for a long time.===== Verdict =====Visually it runs really well on high settings with no bugs (so far), but that's pretty much where the pros stop.I'm being really generous here when i say that i recommend this game, and that'sonlybecause i absolutely love this game, especially when the plot takes you to Asgard since i'm a big fan of Norse mythology. More so, i recommend it only because technically it does work on my setup after taking a good 20 minutes to map the buttons on keyboard and peripherals. I bought this game purely to enjoy it with friends again, but since controllers don't work, i'm left playing it on my own which takes a lot away from the game's potential experience that i remember.If you love this series and don't mind playing it alone on keyboard + peripherals (i don't, game runs beatifully), then this games for you.If you don't subscribe to the above points, honestly just skip it and spend your money on something else.

All controller issues appear to be fixed, andmissing characters have been added!""Never had I see a licensed game take such care and detail in digging into the lore of its universe before.""Marvel Ultimate Alliance was one of my favourite games of the last decade and was followed up with an equally great sequel. Never had I see a licensed game take such care and detail in digging into the lore of its universe before.For me this was the game that truely got me into Marvel's vast universe and wide cast of characters. I truely believe it was these games that helped push interest for the wider universe before they started making the MCU. As for the game iself, it explore several diverse sections of Marvel, and has memorable main bosses, memorable CGI cut-scenes (though they used the originals which look a bit blurry now we have HD), and plenty of comic lore to explore and collect.Now for game mechanics; the fighting in this game does feel a little dated now and less fluid then I remember. Still though, every character has their own unique abilities to mix and match for your team and you can spent points leveling up powers or buy upgrades for your costumes. Its still fun mashing hoards of enemies once you get into it but takes a few levels to get used to using your preference characters and move combos. I also remember having the same problems in this game as I did with the early Lego games when you play them on multiplayer with 2 people trying to go in opposite directions but sharing a locked shared view. You can actually still play up with multiple people if you have controllers on a single PC which is cool or up to 4 online as well. Haven't been able to try online yet since I cant find any games.I'm probably biased because I'm nostalgic about this game, and this game does have its age working against it, but if you enjoyed it the first time around too then you should still do now. As for first time buyers, if you love the Marvel world or even just an interest in knowing more about marvel then you will like how deep this rabbit hole goes.For the price, I wouldnotrecommend buying on its own for the full price, however buying it as part of the pack with the second game is reasonable enough to do."

Originally I had the PS2 version, but when I heard about the Gold Edition on 360 (which I happened to have at the time) and that version included eight exculsive characters, I got it on that system. Now that its on PC, specifically, on Steam, it's almost like Christmas all over again. Though, there were a BUNCHA problems with the initial release. Controls were improperly mapped, there was a plethora of game-crashing bugs, and the fabled Gold Edition content, the epitome of what made the 360 version the Definitive version, was nowhere to be seen. That was then, this is now, the game is fully out, patched up a bit, with the characters and all, and basically ready to play, let's give it a review.The basics of the game is this: Doom is planning something big and bad, and has organized a group of supervillains and is calling this collective the Masters of Evil. Their first target? The S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier flying over NYC, which prompts Nick Fury to call in some reinforcements! Spidey, Thor, Wolverine and Captain America answer Fury's SOS, and from there, they start making scrap out of Ultron's copies and the Doombot's plagueing the Helicarrier. Afterwards, its up to the newly formed ULTIMATE ALLIANCE, a collection of many superhumans from all across the Marvel Universe, to come together and find out what Doom's up to, put a stop to it, hammer his face in a few times, then come back home for some Schwarma!The gameplay is pretty simple. Take a squad of 1 to 4 superheroes and tear through locales of the Marvel universe, destroy roundabout every object and enemy in your path, gain levels, gain powers, collect SHIELD Coins to spend on powers, collect equipment to make your team stronger... if you've played X-Men Legends, its the same basic fair, just now with a whole lineup of Marvel. Each character has a bunch of powers, three additional costumes to unlock, there's a whole plethora of sidemissions you can do on your main mission. If you're a Marvel Buff and wanna test your knowledge, there's a Trivia game in each of the Mission Hubs you can play around with. There's also sketchbooks you can collect while out on missions to view artwork, and there's a handful of character who can be unlocked by finding their 5 of their respective Action Figures scattered through the mission levels! You'll also find Training Simulation Discs which will have Missions you can play for additional unlocks!The sound is sharp and clear, but that's kind of to be expected, its an HD port after all. There's a handful of weird sound bugs, such as hearing a strange announcer shout out with Critical Power Attacks. Maybe its a superhero thing or maybe I just don't remember doing them a while back, but they seem out of place.With the Gold Content added in (the originally Xbox 360 exclusive characters of Venom, Doom, Magneto, Sabretooth, Hawkeye, Cyclops, Nightcrawler and Hulk), I can safely say I can enjoy this game no problem, now. This is (almost) truly the complete experience. Why the (almost)? Black Widow and Captain Marvel were characters playable in the PSP/Wii versions of the game. That being said, their absence is a small loss, and modders are bound to figure out the game's labyrinthine code setup, and get them in as well.The controller problems are primarily fixed, though budget controllers still have issues with character switching and camera adjustment. That being said, M&KB play isn't as horrible as it seems to be anymore, especially if you turn off that abysmal Click-To-Move option. It was cute idea, yeah, but it just wasn't executed well. It seems that Clicking the mouse attacks in relative direction to your character now, not sure if that was originally there before the Character Patch, but I kind of like it. It definitely makes fighting a bit easier.A large plethora of bugs have been taken care of, including the horrendously problematic Simulator Mission Crash Bug (seemingly.) There's still a few bugs that have persisted since the game's genesis years ago, such as the Dum Dum Dougan Sidemission text (those who played know the one.) That being said, there's a potentially problematic bug which for Win7 users if you're not up to date with your system updates, which will cause the game to not even boot up. A potentially problematic occurence if you're looking to... y'know.. play the game. Make sure you're all caught up with your system updates, and everything should run fine.With all this being said, is MUA worth the price of admission? ...Well.... yes and no. As a standalone for $40, HELL NO. I spent $60 on this game when it was new, ten years ago! I might have enjoyed it, but that doesn't mean I'd be happy to buy it at almost full price again. If you're going to buy the game, get the Bundle Deal. By technical terms, it makes each game a more reasonable $30, and, in my eyes, they're both definitely worth playing, especially since they both have their complete content.TL;DR VERSION: S'good. Grab the MUA Bundle."

Even now, I hear there are struggles with certain controllers. However, as someone who played it on keyboard on a low(ish) end laptop, I had a decent experience with this.I was in love with this game back when it was originally released. I lost the disc copy I had back in '06/'07 and was longing for a long time for a way to play it again and my wish came true at the end of the summer last year.The only technical issues I ran into when playing this was EARLY ON when there was a bug with the game crashing after completing simulator disc missions from the kiosk in hub areas. This has been FIXED now though and I haven't had any issues since.The graphics didn't receive very much of a boost from the Gold edition of the game which seems weird for an alleged remaster, but a more accurate description would be a port. The game design is a bit outdated with limited backtracking availability for certain missed collectibles and the inconsistent behavior of parts of the already-completed game resetting itself with enemies and bosses.However, all of that aside, this game is the bees knees. It's so addicting to try out different combos of characters and even making mini ""builds"" RPG style by matching up the right equipment to the right stat boosts on certain costumes to make your characters the most viable. Combat is simple but really fun. A handful of different playstyles can be achieved with the right setup. The Marvel universe is brough to life for casual fans and hardcore ones alike. The soundtrack is actually pretty catchy and will stick around in your head unexpectedly often.The price is the biggest thing holding me back from calling this a must buy right now. I still recommend it due to the great fun I've gotten out of it, but if you aren't a humongous Marvel fan or don't have disposable income, I'd wait for a price drop. Even if you ARE those things, a price drop or a sale is probably your best bet. But definitely get it at some point!"

So I couldn't ready up to get out of the menu, and I had to alt-f4 the game.Next time we tried, we noticed he was stuck with the game thinking his R-Trigger was held down all the time, so he couldn't use regular attacks unless he was holding the L-Trigger.  We expect it's a deadzone problem but since it isn't configurable in the game and doesn't reflect in the Windows Controllers UI, there was nothing we could do to fix it.The graphics menu showed me no less than 45 1280x1024 resolutions, but not a single 1920x1080 -- which didn't matter anyways because the game seems to have just used my desktop resolution, regardless of what it was set to.  There's also still a graphics quality option that has no options and doesn't do anything.That said, when I played 20 minutes of solo, I was quickly reminded just how much fun the games actually are, making it even more sad the state of their launch on PC.

The first thing I noticed when I fired this up was like many stated the button mapping for the 360 was off. I didn't feel like googling anything to get the fix for it. So figured I would dust off my steam controller and give it a whirl for the game.The steam controller worked flawless with no need to change anything. I love my steam controller but it mostly only sees any uses if I'm playing a point and click game or something that doesn't require fast movements. But now with Marvel UA and Marvel UA2 I have found a new found love for my steam controller even more. So if you want to purchase Marvel UA but not sure because of the bad reviews I say buy it especially if you have a steam controller as it won't take any effort to start playing it right off the bat. If your using a 360 or xbox one controller just spend a little time and google the fix. I'm sure it takes no more than 5 minutes to address the issue.
,Recommended,433300,25991345,"Posted: 11 October, 2016",all,Wirdjos,"This is truly an unpolished gem of a game. Putting aside the glitches that the remastered edition introduced, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance had plenty of problems already. There's nothing painful enough to stop you from enjoying yourself, but there are constantly things that just don't work right. Body parts tend to phase through each other, dialogue sound cuts out randomly, and enemies will bounce off the invisible edges of endless pits. I think I even finished the final battle by pushing the boss through a wall. The ridiculousness adds an unintentional layer of humor which fits well in a comic book adaptation. You're already being tossed from one unconnected location to the next with only a paper-thin plot to tie them together, and character conversations seem to be ripped straight from Wikipedia. But none of that matters as long as the action is there, and it is. There's an endless parade of various minions to pummel and an equally diverse list of moves to do it with. Characters can be customized with skill points and abilities as well as costumes that have their own set of boosts, all of which have to be earned and developed. Characters can only have three abilities at a time - not counting the Xtreme move particular to each character which can't be switched out - and groups can only have four heroes at a time, so there's a certain strategy to your choices. Simulator disc missions often place characters alone, revealing their personal strengths. The journey is also peppered with side quests, adding ramifications to the player's decisions which are explored in a cleverly presented epilogue.Strangely enough, filling the playable character roster with actual Marvel heroes does seem to have acted as a double-edge sword. In many places, the plot would have made more sense if Fury's 'Team' was made up of player-created heroes. When it's mentioned that the X-men have done this or the Fantastic Four did that, it seems silly that Storm and the Thing are standing right there, doubly so when Cyclops asks Professor Xavier who he is. The times when characters do have special dialogue with someone they have a relationship with are pretty special though and the charm of hearing familiar catchphrases or looking through generations-old costumes would be missed.There's a lot to love here and about as much to hate. For every time Ultimate Alliance endears a player with its respect for decades of background, another AI-controlled character irritates by randomly jumping off a cliff or just stopping in their tracks entirely. If you think you can look past the game's many flaws, there's plenty of simple comic book-y fun to be had."

The problem here was the game believed I was playing local co-op as the mouse and controller were both plugged in. So I restarted the game, removed the mouse and made sure to press A and not START at the first menu.

It was pulled a while back because of licensing only to recently reappear. Its relaunch alongside Ultimate Alliance 2 was not without its problems. These were documented by the likes of Jim Sterling and Totalbiscuit which included issues like unfunctioning menus that did nothing, audio issues, and controller issues.Now I am pleased to say that it appears these issues have been resolved. During my time with the game I have not encountered any of these issues. The menus work and there are a number of resolution options as well as keybinding options for keyboards. I do recommend playing it with a controller. I use my WiiU controller and it works pretty well with a WiiU controller adapter set to Xinput.The game itself is a bit like Diablo in that you assemble a group of heroes and traverse a variety of environments and locales pulled from the Marvel universe. Along the way you will earn currency and points that can be used to upgrade skills and abilities. In addition you can unlock a variety of costumes each with their own bonuses that can also be further augmented with points. There are also characters, comics and concept art to unlock as well. The game boasts a pretty extensive roster of heroes ranging from Spiderman, Cap, Wolverine, Deadpool, Dr. Doom, Thing, Spider Woman, Iron Man and more.The story is a bit too silly for my tastes as you will deal with one threat only to have another crop up almost immediately. It suffers from a lot of plot contrivances but at the end of the day the game is still fun to play.The voice acting is a bit of a mixed bag. Certain characters definitely sound better than others. Wolverine and a few characters definitely sound on point while others are a bit indistinguishable from others. Marvel Heroes 2016 certainly has the edge in terms of voice acting with the likes of David Hayter playing Winter Soldier, Nolan North voicing Deadpool and so on.The elephant in the room is the price. I don't know if I can quite recommend this game at full price considering that Marvel Heroes 2016 is similar to this game and can be played for free. I would recommend this game to anyone who is a Marvel fan and has a bit of nostalgia for the game. The game is certainly in a better state now than what it was.

There's a new game out, Marvel Heroes, which is basically the same, it's made for PC so the controls make sense, and it's more up to date (graphically and what not- if that matters to you). It also has a bigger roster, and Deadpool is played by Nolan North.This game is alright, if you see it for $5 go ahead and check it out, but when you can play Marvel Heroes for free (or purchase one character and constantly get everything else for free or whatever), it's more modern, and it improved on this game's formula so you might as well just play that one. There is honestly little difference between the two minus maybe the story which only serves the game play in both so isn't the reason to play these games. Maybe if you want to be able to control three characters at once for no reason other than this was a console game that wanted co-op play this one instead.

Using Windows 10 with a Xbox one controller and Microsoft adapter, the game button mapping is so screwed up its not playable.

76561198004811351,Not Recommended,433300,24688278,"Posted: 3 August, 2016",all,AbsoluteDeicide,"When Marvel Ultimate Alliance was originally released a decade ago it was a dream come true for comic book fans. Featuring dozens of playable characters from Marvel's lengthy history and providing deep dives into the lore, it was both an incredibly fun brawler/RPG at a time where good licensed games were rare and a reference tome for comic nerds. With smart variations to the gameplay to keep the standard beat-'em-up formula from getting stale, hours of optional content, secrets, and unlockables, and near limitless replayability, every inch of the game was a testament to Raven's love and care to the modern mythology of Marvel. If only an inch of that care went into this re-release/remaster... whatever this is...If you were to look at the price of this game and the release date, you could reasonably assume all of the optional, platform specific content was included, the graphics were improved, maybe the entire game had been rebuilt from scratch in a new engine, or any combination of those. Proving the age old adage about assumptions true, none of that is present here. The only notable improvement to this re-release is an upscaled resolution, everything else is the same if not worse. If you looked at the game and took the more pessimistic, cynical attitude of a cashgrab that was rushed out the door to cash in on the current superhero craze that's riddled with bugs you're on the right track.Being a massive fan of Ultimate Alliance (previously playing the hell out of it on Xbox 360), I bought this more or less on blind faith the day it was available. It was almost comically broken; the very first button prompt (“Press 'A' to Start) didn't work. Figuring maybe you had to fiddle with some button mapping to sort out using a controller I went into the settings menu, and even that was a mess. Getting hung up on options, being unresponsive, it amounted to guesswork to get anything to register. To top it all off, the controller diagram used for the menu was the same one I was attempting to use: an Xbox One controller... so they went to the trouble of making that picture, but didn't bother trying to get past the first screen of the game using it. After some time fumbling with that, I switched to a wired Xbox 360 controller that I keep handy for playing older games with similar issues with modern hardware, and it worked fine. Good for me (?), but this isn't an excusable issue in 2016.The game itself is still amazing! Part '90s arcade brawler, part Diablo dungeon crawler RPG, and a lengthy, epic cosmic story that is constantly escalating in scope, Marvel Ultimate Alliance is dumb fun defined. Like a good Saturday morning cartoon it's unapologetic in it's absurdity. From fighting a dragon on a giant heli-carrier, to battling mermen in Atlantis, going to Hell to fight demons, and to Asgard to save Thor and Friends, the variety in locations and enemies is inspired. While the core loop of punching people in the face to level up so you can punch more people in the face is present, there are just enough loops thrown at you to keep it from getting stale. There are some simplistic puzzles to solve, platforming challenges, then there's Murderworld where you're tasked with playing fully realized versions of Pitfall and Breakout. You can take a break from the main game at mission hubs where you can talk to a large cast of NPCs to flesh out the story or answer hundreds of obscure Marvel trivia questions for bonus XP. There is a lot of game here, and it's all worth experiencing.A big chunk of the side content of the game is trying to complete Simulation Missions: one off scenarios for either your team or a specific hero that are unlocked by finding collectibles scattered around the main game. Not only are these missions nice breaks from the story, they are a great way to level up your team and are how you unlock certain costumes for them. Oh, and they're broken in this version. Not only will most of them cause the game to crash consistently, but once it even deleted a couple of my saves. So that was cool...Marvel Ultimate Alliance is a classic game, but this version is riddled with asterisks. The only thing you can currently do without holding your breath and hoping the game doesn't crash is play through the main story. There are no extras here, and there's actually more content in the original release (*DLC characters are “coming” at the time of writing). The joke of controller support has been more or less fixed (*except when you have to press a key on the keyboard on the upgrade screen), but let's not forget that it was an issue on release, and this wasn't an Early Access game. So if you can take all of that nonsense into account, swallow the price tag, and you're still interested you have a great game waiting for you... a couple patches down the road."

Literally.I remember first playing this game on my cousin's PlayStation 2, back in 2007. I absolutely fell in love with it. Spider-Man was the only hero for me, while my cousin used Deadpool (which at the time we had no idea who he was, but we thought he looked badass). I ended up buying the game myself and replaying it about 5 more times.On 2009, I got my Playstation 3. Which came with this game. Having already completed the game, I didn't really expect nothing new. Until I saw the Character Selection Screen. And there, I saw both Colossus and Moon Knight (which were not available on PS2). I told my cousin about it, and he consistently asked me: ''How'd got them''? Which I replied with: ''I don't know, they were just there''. After watching some YouTube videos about the game in the same year. I found a video called: ''Marvel Ultimate Alliance All characters and ultimate team''. Halfway throuh the video, I took notice of some extra characters he had, such as Venom, Magneto, and Hulk. After some more research, I discovered the game had a ''Gold'' edition. Which contained 8 extra characters. Since I owned a PS3 at the time, I didn't have the chance to play with them. Until last year.Reasons for being the best version out there:*All DLC characters*1080p and higher resolutions*Controller support (I played the whole game with a PS4 controller)*60 FPS (PCMR exclusive)I totally recommend this game.

Graphics are strong but the game doesn't require a very high-end PC. The game is fully patched (although a handful of DLC characters have not been put in) and has stood the test of time. The game treats its source material with the respect it deserves and its tour of the Marvel Universe (circa 2005, since Wolverine: Enemy of the State and Captain America: Winter Soldier are the latest stories it references) is comprehensive. It's easy to test out various characters and decide which ones are most fun to play and/or most useful in a fight. (For my first playthrough, I eventually settled on Captain America, the Hulk, Storm, and Spider-Man. The first three were picked because they were really useful, but I picked Spider-Man purely out of a desire to use him to smash Mephisto's face in.) While the game is primarily targeted at people like me who are familiar with the comics, it's impossible to get lost in the lore, since there are plenty of dialogue options with NPCs to explain things like ""what is SHIELD"" or ""who is Namor.""Cons: major learning curve, complicated controls, quicktime events in some of the boss fights."

It's a simple beat em up game wtih simple RPG elements in there such as giving points into your powers and equiping items on characters and unlocking costumes.

I can't really explain why, but this is my favorite video game.First things first:  Let's discuss how terrible a port this is.  Actually - let's not.  Just scroll through the reviews and you'll see the reasons.  I do not play with a controller, so I didn't have those issues.  That being said, using the keyboard / mouse combo is nigh unplayable.  It would be great if you could map the controls so your left and right mouse buttons could be regular / strong attacks, but you can't.Here's how I'm playing:  Use WASD to move with my left hand, with my left pinky on the ctrl button to activate powers.  I use my right hand the number pad for powers and attacks.  In my case, I use numpad #1-4, also remapping normal / heavy attacks to numpad ENTER and +.This control configuration feels clumsy as all heck at first, but it doesn't take long for muscle memory to kick in and I've got a smooth mouse-free way of playing.Back to the Underoos - if you grew up in the late '70s, you probably had these (or at least knew about them).  Superheroes back then were everywhere then just like they are today, but instead of AAA-quality movies, we had Lou Ferrigno, Adam West, Linda Carter, and Morgan Freeman narrating the Spider-Man skits on the ""Electric Company"" on PBS.  It was shallow cash-grabs and lunchbox fodder, mostly.Fast-forward three decades or so, and I picked this game up for my PSP right before a business trip.  Omigosh - I played the HECK outta this game.  At that time, I didn't even know who half of these characters even were, let alone their backstories / origins.  This completely rekindled my interest in Comics, and I started collecting books, reading all about this varied universe, and some of the great stories Stan Lee and The Boys put together.I then bought this game for my PS2 so I could play with my kids.Then I bought it for the Wii... because it had a couple of characters not available on PSP/PS2.When it was time to upgrade my PS2 for a PS3 - you guessed it, I bought it again.And now it's on Steam.  Yup... bought it again.  Granted the asking price for this and the sequel aren't really appropriate given the game's age and quality of the port (again - all revolving around controller issues and command mapping).  Even the $30 sale package is too much - but at this point, how many times have I bought this?The game itself plays out in ARPG/Diablo/Torchlight fashion with lots of unlockables, fun one-off comic book missions that revolve around one particular hero, their backstory, and usually of that heroes' iconic villains (Spider-Man vs. Rhino, Cap against Winter Soldier, that sort of thing).  The story spans so, SO many aspects of the Marvel Universe.  Saving the Skrull homeworld from Galactus, helping Namor reclaim Atlantis, the Inhumans on the moon, Mandarin's palace in Asia, hell (!), and the Sanctum Sanctorum, just to name a few.You enjoying the comic-book hero resurgence?  Like ARPGs?  Want to explore the Marvel Universe and learn more about the characters?  This is your game.  For real."

I went to the menu to enable his controller and the game wouldn't let him.So I restarted the game,the controller finally worked but it would let him switch characters and the button layout was same the same as my xbox one controller but when he tried attacking the buttons weren't corrsponding.For example,the 'X' button is to grad on my his and my layout but 'Y' was to throw.Like WTF,the game does'nt look any better from what I remember.It honestly looks better on the PS2 than it does on the PC.The volume is too low in this game and the 2ND one.And It's $40 for the game and $60 for the bundle that's a terrible deal.I'm all about buying revamped games especially if the price gets reduced because of a bundle.But,this is not a deal this is a steam from out pockets.The second game even has the same problems,so I wouldn't reccomend local multiplayer for this game until Activision comes out with a brand new update.O YEAH where tha ♥♥♥♥ is the DLC at,TBH I didn't know that there was DLC for games back there's until I ♥♥♥♥ING HEARD THAT DLC IS NOT INCLUDED IN THYS ♥♥♥♥♥.ACTIVISION ADD OUT ♥♥♥♥ING DLC,MAKE HD TEXTURES,BETTER SOUND QUALITY,STABLE ONLINE MODE AND FIX THA ♥♥♥♥ING CONTROL ISSUES FOR PEOPLE PLAYING LOCAL MULTIPLAYER.THIS NEEDS TO GET ♥♥♥♥ING FIXED BECAUSE NOW I'M MAD THIS IS THE WORST PORT FOR OLD GAMES.I BOUGHT DEAD ISLAND DEFINITIVE COLLECTION FOR $40.02.Those games come when enhanced graphics,better online playability and a cheap price for a good game.ACTIVISION GET WIT THA ♥♥♥♥ING PROGRAM FO REALZ YO."

Thankfully, the games have been patched several times now to fix MOST of these issues as unfortunately some people are still reporting controllers not working (I believe the only controllers still affected are Logitech ones although I could be mistaken) and the simualtion missions which make up the bulk of the MUA post game are seemingly causing consistent crashes after their completion. However, the audio bug plaguing MUA2 has been fixed, and there are several workarounds that users have found for repeatable crashes that may or may not work for everyone experiencing them (as is so often the case with workarounds) and most controllers now work with the correct mapping.Marvel have stated that further patches will come and the DLC characters for MUA1 are on the way within the next few weeks, so it looks like the game will be in the state that it should have been in from launch soon. That being said, this is a rather good port of the original game (from what I've seen so far) and should entertain me for a while longer. If you have the money I would recommend picking this up... because its Activision publishing this and you know how they just LOVE to reduce their prices ;)."

I had the original on PS2 and PC. The PC version is still on one my HDD's w/ DLC. Quick note: Original w/ DLC 6.43GB, this 'remastered' is 5.9GB. I very briefly looked into the directory and the only thing I noticed right away is 64bit and possibly updated DirectX stuff. That's it.This is more or less a port over. Not remaster. The controller bugs are the same in the original for PC(it was that akward time when MS started forcing Xinput on everyone). The res. caps at 1280x1024 100hz(WTF!), same as original except that was 60-85hz. Ironically lower res's can go upto 144hz. The original stopped working on Windows 10, this one does. So, lets sum it up, we gained maybe 20 frames, 64bit support, and Win 10 support.Worst double dip ever! Activision fix this!!! People loved these games and you're charging premium. Very upset, more than a refund I want resolutions upto 4k at least and customizable controls.Didn't play enough to experience the sound issues but can tell you right away its probably related to the Fmod sound. Google it, there are fixes and known issues.Upate 7/30/16Both games updated this morning. Control bindings now match. I'm able to adjust the resolution to 4k now also. So, the sound seems fine a the first one. I'm not sure about the DLC, folder is still about the same size as before even though 2gb was dl'd. I think they just deleted/overwrote the bad stuff.Good news is the game is working. For those who don't know. The pc version has always had some issues which it still does but the new problems are solved. Thanks Activision! I'm loving the game again!

Lots of people giving the game a thumbs down and non-recommendations (of course these reviews dated back to last summer). I knew the only way to know was to try it out for myself.I'll admit. $40 is a bit much, especially for a game thats 11 years old. But I suppose I've made the most of it. I start the game, jump in, and immediately notice what most people are talking about.The default controls for the keyboard (which is all I have) are incredibly bonkers. I feel like Im cramed to play one side of the keyboard and bend fingers in ways their not suppose to...I was especially concerned that the options wouldnt allow me to customize these controls, as some reviews have stated. But at last I've managed to figure it all out and assign the controls to more managable configurations.Because of this, I'm definitely having a blast. Everything seems to be working so far. Sound is okay, mechanics are working, no glitches just yet. Its a nostalgic ride from here on out.I would advise not buying this game until the price goes on sale or finally lowers down. Buy at your own risk, I suppose. But once you've managed to figure out the options and make things work, things will work smoothly to your liking.3.5/5 -  Overpriced and screwy default controls, but a fun reexperience once figured out."

I have played through the Prologue with a wired Xbox 360 controller and it plays fine, everything is properly assigned.DLC characters are coming. They did not say if they will be free. Frankly, if they're not free I wouldn't recommend the game,  I feel $40 is already asking a lot, but an extra $5-$10 DLC would just be an insult.Now, besides the controversies and patched issues. Is this a good game even 10 years later? Yes, it is. I played these games a ton back when they were released. One of my favorite games from the 360/PS3 gen of gaming.The game plays a lot like a Diablo style dungeon crawler with more action/RPG elements.You make a team of four heroes, you control one while the AI controls the other three, and you're free to swap between the other three at any time.You have a light attack and Heavy attack, which can combo into various effects, knock ups, knock downs. Then you can set 3 normal abilities that cost energy and your ultimate ability to hotkeys.It has a skill tree system for every hero, you have abilities that unlock as you level, and abilities can have skill points put in to strengthen them.it has a costume system where you unlock costumes, which have a lot of the various classic looks of the heroes, and the costumes have stats on them which you can use tokens earned from enemies to increase.It also has a normal type of gear system, where you get drops from bosses and can equip them on heroes. I don't believe gear stats are random, so there's no real loot grinding for perfect stats.If you're a fan of action/RPG dungeon crawling and Marvel, even though it's a 10 year old game, it's still probably worth $40 (especially if they give us the DLC for free).

,Not Recommended,433300,31474827,Posted: 30 April,all,Badprenup,"This is a direct copy and paste from my refund request:Controls are confusing and not intuitive. The default controls are clunky and make little sense, they appear to be entirely different from any similar game for no reason. Menu navigation is slow and also confusing, with common methods to go back a menu or cancel (such as escape) not working. You can hover over things with the mouse to select them, but clicking on them does not work, you instead need to use the attack button for all menu selections, and the power attack button to cancel any actions (I'm assuming these are mapped to A and B on a standard xbox controller).This would all be workable if I could change the controls, but that doesn't seem to be all that possible. The control menu is a mess, with only about 10 ""Actions"" showing up in the list at one time. You can more or less change these controls just fine. However there are many more controls that need to be edited to make this playable. It was not immediately apparent how to reach additional controls as the mousewheel cannot scroll through them (another common menu navigation method that this game seems to ignore), and there are no pages that you can select to find the other controls.You instead need to use the gameplay directional buttons to scroll down to the additional options. Again, this would be fine, albeit very slow. But the major issue is that as soon as you try and change one of the controls that do not appear initially in the menu, the list of controls resets and places you back at the top of the list. I have been unable to find a way to change these controls as it resets the list each time. And of course, it does not even bug out correctly, as the list of in game actions you are trying to change resets to the top of the list, but it still displays the controls that were for the actions you had scrolled down to."

The game has issues, however the situation isn't as dire as the reviews suggests, and I feel the need to balance out the reviews of people who won't bother changing them, regardless if these problems got fixed/patched. And patches have arrived.I will go over a general review of the game itself, it's technical issues, and what got fixed already that 0.1hrs negative reviews mislead you about.About the game in generalThe original was relased back in 2006 in retail stores, never had a digitally aviable edition. This is basicly that, patched up to natively support all the standard HD resolutions, have a very slightly better graphics here and there, with tiny user interface polishes and steam achievements added. On top of the fact of course, you could not get this game legally in the past 10 years.The gameplay is very similar to Diablo-ish games, imagine that designed for controllers. You control a team of 4 heroes (with local and online co-op aviable) going through many worlds from ocean cities to hell, circus to castle, sci-fi labs to space cities, in a very long playtime game compared to today's average. My 9 hours in when I write this review, was enough to get me to Act 2 out of 6. (edit: ended up with 20 hours with most of the hidden and optional content unlocked, additonal roughly 3 hours is in there for the solo hero missions to unlock Silver Surfer). The game offers a lot somewhat hidden sideactivities and sidemissions you have to discover for yourself, because no tutorial is telling you anything, it's from those ""good old ages"". The playable heroes are many (see screenshots!) and use the more classic comic versions of course (with customizable abilties and 4 different costumes for everyone), not the later created cinematic universe versions. Technically, the game is running smoothly and flawlessly, with no gameplay or audiovisual glitches anywhere.The game had 4 additional characters as DLC back than, sadly that is not included at this moment, but confirmed to be on their way. You also get 2 bonus characters who were xbox exclusive at the time of the original game, this isn't DLC, but in right now.Technical problemsThis is strictly control related.* Keyboard players, until this get patched, have to get used to seeing the default buttons in QTEs, even if they rebinded their keys. The game does change the shown keys, but keeps forgetting it with each new launch. Your settings are saved and working, but QTEs and menus show the default 1234 keys instead of whatever you replaced them with, until you set your buttons again, or get used to this.* Keyboard players again: the hero details screen uses TAB and CTRL as left and right to swich between heroes. But CTRL is also the button that allows you to place the highlighed skill on your hotkey bar, so you have to choose the (for example) 3rd skill of a hero to the left of the hero you want, so when you press CTRL you swich to the hero on the right and bring up the hotkey bar replacement menu. Annoying? It is, but nothing that stops a nostalgia fueled dedicated fan.* Controller players: using a 360 wired controller, strictly in the hero details menus the game sometimes forgets what item is highlighted, and you cannot interact with it until moving away and highlighting it again or mousing over it while you keep it highlighted. Any other controller related issue you may see in negative reviews HAVE BEEN PATCHED.Arrived patches, future patchesThe game recently recieved a 2Gb patch that solved most of the almost offend level issues, such as the game greeting you with a PRESS A title screen where you have to press X to move on. Wireless controller compatibility issues have also been resolved already. In case someone scrolled down here instantly, I mention it again: the missing DLC is confirmed to be on it's way, along with futher patching that is also confirmed to be SPECIFICLY targeted at the PC version's issues, and is NOT some general all platform patch that fixes invisible bugs people don't even know about because they never encounter them.Overall, the game is far from being as bad as people make it seem so. Other than the minor controlling issues, it's next to flawless regarding performance, the game itself is exactly as good as it was back in it's time because it's literally unchanged, but recieved a slight change to the interface to make those UGLY grey backgrounds semi-transparent and got 2 bonus characters, with 4 more arriving as DLC (paid or free is not clear yet) and steam based online multiplayer support."

A few months ago I got ""the Division"" for less than the cost of these older games. I am taking nothing away from the Marvel games, I still love them. However in the day and age of ""remasters"" and ""Next-Gen Re-releases"" I think that gaming companies are charging to much money accross the bored.. trading on our fond memories of older games."

It's basically a dungeon crawler with good multi-player and solo play options, where you can upgrade the heroes powers, costumes (not visually, in terms of stats they can give) and items. The attention to detail in terms of characters back story, interactions between characters, locations and more is incredibleThe use of powers may be a bit strange for those of you that are used to the original; There, all of your powers were on separate buttons, but here to hold a key and use the four main action buttons to activate your powers, changing them out in a similar way. It isn't ideal, and is very strange if you weren't used to it, but it only took me a few areas to get used to the new style of play, and I must admit its pretty fluidI've seen a lot of complaints here about bugs and crashes. So far, the only issue that I have had is that if I tab out on the loading screen between areas, the game will crash, but that happened in the original release of the game as well, so I should have known that was a problem. There is one other crash from the original game that I am anticipating, but I haven't gotten far enough into the game to confirm if it is present yet. Basically, near the beginning of the second act you have two fights with Jean Grey (Spoilers, she's mind controlled, she isn't a villain, promise) and after the introductory discussion with her in the second fight, it was known that the game would stop accepting key inputs, and I'll update this review when I get there to let you know if its still there. But other than that? All the glitchy things mentioned in other reviews? The changing of controls? I haven't experienced any of it. Now, that could be because I have altered the controls to suit my playstyle, meaning I'm not using the default controls, but I doubt that is an issueYes, the graphics aren't great. The game is 10 years old though, frankly, what do you expect? They have been improved upon, but they still aren't fantastic. The price is very high, and I would certainly recommend getting the bundle with both games in for the value. The gameplay though is very fun, the references to the Marvel universe are excellent and well handled, the combat feels very fluid with the rapid skill switching and combos, and in every way I think this game is worth playing. It was one of my favourite game growing up, and it still holds that upon replaying now. I'm not saying that through nostalgia, though that will obviously play a part, but I'm noticing extra things in the game that I never utilised previously and extra features that make it even better than my memoriesOverall, I would rate the game at 8/9 out of 10. The graphics aren't great, the price is high, and there is one crash (that I have found so far), but everything else about the game is excellent. I definitely recommend this to all of you, even if you aren't Marvel fans"

I play with a Logitech F310 Gamepad, and I have to hit the switch on the backside to 'D' just to have the majority of controls... except with buttons reversed (B swapped with A, X swapped with Y, RB and RT reversed, etc, etc) and no ability to switch using the D-Pad. It's playable... but obviously backwards in terms of a natural feel... then there is of course having to switch controls to the keyboard / mouse setting for puzzles that require you to have the heroes in two different spots (those who played the Helicarrier portion should know what I'm referring too).It is frustating and time consuming, but hopefully the gamepad issues will be resolved with that patch I keep hearing about"

,Recommended,433300,24546495,"Posted: 26 July, 2016",all,Knolin,"Honest review from someone who WISHED for this to be re-released on PC for years. I played the originals when they came out, still have my original Xbox Gold copy AND I kept my 360 JUST for this game.Pre-launch - I was super eager at the announcement of this release, and didn't even care about the $60 tag (Of course I was going to get both.) Tried to do some digging about the DLC content, and nothing was announced at all, so I just assumed they'd release it because why wouldn't they?Post-launch - Bought the game, and turned them on and dinked around for roughly 10 minutes. I'm not going to give the game itself a breakdown, you can play it for yourself (Most likely you already have). Game looks great considering its age, runs silky smooth, and the controls (Wired 360 controller) work very well. No problems whatsoever. I haven't tried the keyboard, nor do I plan to. A lot of reviews are slamming the controls and I can only assume it's for the keyboard or the Xbone controller. I have no issues. Ultimate Alliance, as far as I can tell, does NOT come with -any- of the DLC characters for the Xbox Gold version, the PSP, or GBA. While I didn't even know the portables had exclusive DLC, it was kind of heart-breaking to hear that the console characters were missing. So much so, I considered passing on the games until I heard more news. Especially with the price tag, I'd have expected a more ""complete"" game to be released. I have no idea if this is a licensing issue or Activision greed, but I don't like it. Even with that, I took the plunge, bought the game, and am really surprised at how well it turned out. It looks and plays great, and can't wait to get online with some friends to punch some baddies.Pros+ Silky smooth 60 FPS+ Graphics have aged well, look sharper+ Controls great+ Lives up to the hype I remembered in the pastCons- Price- No DLC charactersI recommend this game, but do so with a heavy heart. I'll undoubtedly get great value, personally, but am very disappointed in the lack of content that SHOULD have been released, and for the price I payed. If I could give it a more medium judgement, I would. That said, the game is just as great as I remembered."

This will be a fun game once/if they fix the controls.  i.e. L/R triggers dont do anything, L/R bumpers act as L/R Triggers, when it prompts you to hit the A button its mapped to the X button, the D pad does not select other party members to play as it should etc etc etc.As I said, there is definately something here, some definate fun to be had, but i will park this game in the library until the controls are fixed.Ok...

It looks great, runs smooth and the keyboard controls are easily remapped. And, unlike last time, we not only get Colossus and Moon Knight, but the whole previously console-exclusive set of 8 DLC heroes (Cyclops, Hawkeye, Hulk and Nightcrawler) and villains (Doom,Magneto, Sabertooth,Venom) to boot! And one of them is none other than Doctor Doom himself!And speaking of console stuff brought over, the control schemes are a clear example of a hasty console port and the UI has some strange quirks to it. Minor grievances at best, but definitely eyebrow-raising.Also raising those same eyebrows is the price. Even I have to admit that for a slightly upscaled 10 year old game $40USD is kinda steep. The deal becomes a little more enticing with the bundle, which brings down the price to $30USD, but even that seems to be stretching it a bit.So, I definitely recommend this classic, but either get it in the bundle or wait until it - or even the bundle - is on sale."

People seem to be butthurt about the price and the missing DLC.What people don't seem to remember is that the original retail PC version did not come with any DLC. However, Moon Knight and Colossus which were Xbox exclusive characters do come in this new Steam version. I was hoping that MUA1 would be included, but it doesn't effect gameplay what so ever.As for the price, everyone is different and I personally felt that the $60 bundle price was well worth it. I've played MUA1 on both PC and console along with MUA2 on console many, many times; there is a ton of content here for the price. I won't argue that a lower price point would have been preferable, but like I said, I didn't even think twice about this purchase.With regard to the controls, they work almost flawless with a wired Xbox controller. The only issue I had was with the A button not working to equip items, costumes or adding skill points. Kind of a major part of the game.The one problem I do have with the game is that v-sync locks the frame rate for me at 30 fps which seems odd, and the mouse cursor continues to show on the screen even while using a controller.I loved this game in the past and find it's well worth the price point for the many hours of entertainment that it will give me.

The big factor here for me is the price. $40 a game is completely unreasonable in the state that it's in. $60 would be worth it for both games if only the settings and menus weren't so buggy and unusable. The gameplay itself gave me absolutely no problems, other than not being able to adjust the resolution (menu says it's at 640x480 but it looks like 4K downscaled so...???) and also buying perks in the powers menu. I did however get the latter to work by fiddling around with the mouse and clicking on the perk, which did nothing, but only after hitting A on my controller let me choose the perk. The unchangeable res I played at actually looked beautiful at 144fps and there were no audio issues for me. Xbox 360 controller worked like a charm. Please fix the menu bugs, Activision. We aren't asking for much, just a FULLY FUNCTIONAL port, and suckers like me can justify that high price if just for that alone. This game is a ton of fun and I still had a blast playing it, but fix that and lower the price, or at least give us the original game's DLC. For a direct crappy port of a 2006 game, the price deserves a $15 or at the most, $20 price point. One last thing I'd like to make clear: MUA1 is NOT a remaster by any means. Don't go into this expecting that. It looks great on modern systems and displays, but that's all it has going for it in that regard.EDIT:10 of 12 found the above helpful. The first part was on release and subsequently, changing my review will wipe all ratings. As of 9/21/2016, this game is in decent shape. Controls mostly work, at least if you're using Microsoft brand controllers. Afterglow still is broken. Higher hz monitors (mine is 144hz) seem to cause a lot of the issues in both games, so make sure you force the game to 60 FPS to ensure there are no problems. DLC characters were added to the game. It's playable. Multiplayer is good, only slightly laggy when first loading up a level but really nothing bad. I can finally say I recommend this one, but still not at the current asking price.

The game definitely shows its age in the graphics but seems to be ported accurately from the console.  One of the first things you may want do out the gate is to go into the hero details and turn off auto assignment of ability points (each character has to do this) and also auto equipping of gear (again, each character) and any time you change anybody on your team, repeat.  You also have to be real careful with your button presses during conversations or you may miss dialog (try not to double press the A button).
