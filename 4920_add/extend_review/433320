Thus far, it seems that the crackling sound and controller issues have been fixed and the game seems to be fully functional.This port had a really shakey start, but now that it's been fixed, it's a fantastic game. Having played Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 1 to death on the Wii when it was released, I was elated to hear that its sequel was getting a PC port/remaster. After waiting until the patch fixing the host of issues with the game, I picked it up and thus far I have not been disappointed. One thing that you need to realize before making your purchase is that this game is not a remaster, as many first thought. It has been upscaled to modern resolutions and given a boost to 60 fps, but otherwise, no major changes have been made to the game. If you played the game before and enjoyed it, you'll be getting all of the same. Just don't expect anything new. As such, it's very difficult to justify the price-point, so I'd suggest waiting for a sale to purchase the game, or purchasing the current 2-game package that is being offered. I would not recommend this if you do not have a controller or do not like fiddling with key-bindings because the default keyboard controls are ABYSMAL.On the topic of controllers, I would like to give Zoe/Activision some serious props as they actually took the time to create an official Steam Controller profile for the game, so it's very much plug-n-play. Not enough developers are supporting the steam controller like this, so it was refreshing to load up my configuration and see that it was already good to go.I recommend this game very lightly as though it's very enjoyable, the price is very difficult to justify for a seven-year-old game with no modern graphical enhancements. If you haven't played the sequel and don't mind the price, however, the game is an absolute treat."

I never got to play Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2 because it was never released on PC before so I was especially excited to at least finally get to experience it.  If nothing else, I figured a nice graphics update would suffice and hopefully a game engine update would follow.  Since I modded the original game a ton, this new release got me interested because of the amazing new possibilities and I would finally get to mod the sequel.Except not.  This game is amazing in itself, but the port is a total dumpster fire.  The day of release, controller support did not work properly at all.  With any form of Xinput type controllers, button mappings were either♥♥♥♥♥backwards (""A"" was really ""X"", ""Start"" was really ""R3"", etc) or not functional whatsoever.  I had a hell of a time even getting passed the initial start menu.  When I got in game, I couldn't swap characters at all.  I couldn't use powers.  I went to the Options menu, and I couldn't even rebind any keys or buttons whatsoever.  For Direct input, the compatibility was stripped from the game all together.The UI is just a polished turd with a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥coat of paint on it.  The ""Options"" menu should be renamed ""Lack of Options"" menu because every meaningful option was stripped out.  Graphics settings can be summarized up in 3 words:  Low, Medium, or High.  What?Everything about this port is totally garbage.  This game obviously never went through QA because even the initial start menu doesn't work properly.  Or maybe it did go through QA, and the quality they were shooting for is &quot♥♥♥♥♥♥poor"", hoping we would say ""♥♥♥♥ this"" and just go buy the console version instead.Lack of options, sound issues, no ability to rebind controls, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controller support at best.  I refunded this game immediately.  Unfortunately, shortly after I was told there was a patch that supposedly fixed all the issues. Some people even say the controls are working now.  So, me being a dumb fan and believing them, decided to go ahead and repurchase the game and get the patch.  The patch fixed almost nothing.  I use a Logitech F710 wireless gamepad which emulates a wireless Xbox 360 controller and works flawlessly in every single other game that supports Xbox controller... except for this one, because unfortunately this port is bad, and Activision should feel bad even releasing it at all.  I mean how could you POSSIBLY ♥♥♥♥ up controller support when this port was from a CONSOLE version of the game SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED to run on controller?To be quite honest, even Arkham Knight wasn't this much of a blatant cluster ♥♥♥♥ on release.  There is no excuse to release a 10 year old game with no true remastering, no graphics or gameplay updates, no way to customize controls, audio issues, and no way to actually ♥♥♥♥ing play it and charge $40 for it.  If Zoe Mode isn't out of business by next week, then something is terribly wrong because they suck.  I normally don't trash devs this hard or support people losing their jobs, but if there is one company that deserves to fold over this nonsense it is the developer who made this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port.If you want to experience this game for the amazing game it truly is, then I would unfortunately suggest just grabbing the original console version.  If you want to experience this game for the complete♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of a port it is, then stick with the Steam version.  But don't say I didn't warn you."

,Recommended,433320,24741937,"Posted: 6 August, 2016",all,daVid // PSN: Waveshaper__,"The game was indeed relased in a terrible state,  but it's been patched and is (almost) flawless now, so don't belive the overwhelmingly negative reviews! It usually comes from people who did not bother to change their vote after the game has been fixed.TLDR, what is this game like?It's a LEGO-console Diablo-ish team based action RPG, where you always control a team of 4 heroes (or this time, vallains!) and you practically go forward on linear maps filled with mini sideways leading to the many collectibles that can unlock new characters, art, audiodisc, dossiers about characters and the MARVEL world itself.How is it compared to Ultimate Alliance 1?The gameplay changed in many ways while feels exactly like MUA1. The same control patterns, grabs, throws, whatever, but characters are much more diverse. Ultimate abilities are gone, however instead you have Fusion abilities that allow a unique super powerful skill-duo of 2 heroes, with not entirely but relatively very, very much unique combinations of 24x23 heroes, such as spreading Iron Man's most powerful laser all over the screen with Wolverine's claws or mirror it back from Captain America's shield for a much stronger single and controllable beam, etc. with 24x23 combinations.The gameplay's ""feel"" in general is much more fluid, characters have more unique abilities with less overlapping compared to MUA1, but they also have only 4 abilities instead of 4 choosable out of 7 (but they change if you upgrade them, visually and mechanically too!), and the gameplay design also shifted from less but stronger (more RPG-ish with resistances etc.) enemies to far, far more many that die easier, and I can tell you that slicing through 10-30 enemies with a metallic tornado controlled by Magneto while Human Torch makes the entire whirl burst with flames (or Gambit making each metal piece charged with explosive force) is uncomparable to MUA1's single ultimate abilities.There have been some simplifications after MUA1, most of them are great but some are not so welcome.The combat is much better, there are way, way less empty filler talking (in fact: 0) with a far better Secret War + Civil War storyline that is actually very enjoyable and the new slightly Mass-Effect-ish conversation systems allow for a lot optional talk that isn't written in a tiresome cringeworthy way like before, so definitly huge improvements here. The ""gold"" you collect is finally automatic and each hero gets it separately so you can upgrade everyone at the same time and never going to feel like ""I should have played him/her much sooner, he/she is too weak at this point of the game"" like in MUA1.Having only 4 abilities per hero is I say acceptable in exchange for the Fusion abilities and having more Unique heroes, but sadly everyone has only 1 unlockable alternative costume. At some point in the game you have to pick a side in the Civil War and some heroes naturally belong to your enemy, so they can potentially go locked (templorarly, don't worry just wait for the story to unfold!) and their alternative costumes won't be unlockable until you replay the game again and pick the other side (registration of superheroes or fighting to stay anonym), and this can potentially be frustrating to some. It was for me too for a while, but as much fun as I'm having with MUA2 I'm definitly replaying it in the future if not instantly after finishing it, because your hero progression and unlocks carries over to new game+ on higher difficulties, so I'm not really bothered by this limitation on a few heroes, rather encouraged to play more instead.The PC port: at relase and now.MUA2 had an absolutely garbage relase, but it's been fixed up nicely since. Main problems were controller compatibility issues (adressed, though pay attention the store page says PARTIAL controller support, so the layout is not customizable!) and the game was absolutely unenjoyable because of terrible sound issues making everything sound like your neightbour is drilling the wall (this also has been adressed and is perfect now). Regarding performance, you can easily achieve 60fps and play through the entire (very enjoyable) game, however there is some strange fps swinging when the game randomly drops to 40-50 fps from 60 even if you are standing still doing nothing, so there is that miniature drop that happens a few times (like 2-3 times every 5 minutes) but really you won't feel it, because the gameplay and the animation isn't working in a way that would make it annoying like in an FPS, personally I wouldn't even notice it by now if not having fps written in the corner of the screen. Also the game starts in Windowed Mode for some reason, just Alt+TAB away and back and it's fixed!"

(My understanding was this had to be patched.  Also note that I can't speak to the quality of the mouse and keyboard controls, but since it is a port I'd expect they aren't amazing)-No crashes-No bad audio issuesIt plays how I remember it playing on the xbox 360.It doesn't offer anything new, but if you play with 360 controller you too can recreate fond memories of a heroic beat-em-up now on your PC.I've also played some in Ultimate Alliance(1) and my assement of that is the same as this."
,Recommended,433320,32414536,Posted: 14 June,all,Wirdjos,"Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2 streamlines the successful design of its predecessor by locking characters to a single moveset, reducing the number of costumes per character (which now have no bearing on the character's stats), and allowing ability points to be redistributed at any moment. Surprisingly, all of these limitations create a better experience. The Ultimate Alliance formula was built for couch co-op and less complexity makes it easier for players to join in or swap out.Working against all of that, however, is the way storytelling was streamlined. The first Ultimate Alliance flung our heroes from one corner of the Marvel universe to the next with only the frailest of threads to tie them together. The single united tale this sequel strives to tells - an important one from the comics no less -  is more engaging, but players that join a game in progress will have a harder time finding their bearings.The wheres and whys of brawling through the requisite sea of mooks now have a greater context and the characters have more to say than another thinly veiled recitation of their backstory. On top of that, the story and maps available are affected by your decisions - well, decision anyway - as you're given the opportunity to chose which side of the superhuman community you'd like to support. This choice also limits which characters are available (at least during the first go-round). Though the game is very clear about the three that are locked to each side, this still means that a player's favorite character might be out of circulation for most of the game, further hindering flexibility.Despite its own set of glitches - bosses failing to show up to a fight, enemies shooting from beyond the invisible barriers of the map, etc. - nothing that I experienced was painful enough to cause me to put down the game (ample autosaves helped with that). There's enough replayability here for more than the two playthroughs it takes to see every map, so even those in-and-out co-op players will have plenty of chances to piece together the whole story. It's not a straight line of improvement or decline between Ultimate Alliance 1 and 2, more like two different takes on the same formula and you're in for a good time either way."

Doesn't excuse how poorly handled the launch was, but I had a good time with this. It's fair to note that I played with a keyboard and didn't have to deal with the controller issues, so take my upvote with a grain of salt if you were not planning on playing this way.I enjoyed this game quite a bit. I still like the first game much better for several reasons, but this one is still worth at least one runthrough. Graphics are clean looking for the era it came out in. The combat is just as fun as it was before (albeit with less customization as far as loadouts go). Characters all have their trademark personalities and the story puts an interesting spin on a couple of stories from the comic books.If you've got a few hours to kill and an itch to scratch after the amazing movies and Netflix shows Marvel keeps pumping out, this game (and the first!) should do it for you."

And when you're kicked, the only option seems to be go offline... maybe you can save (not sure), but you can't invite them back into the game and have to restart the session.  Annoying.

,Not Recommended,433320,24546604,"Posted: 26 July, 2016",all,Knolin,"Honest review from someone who WISHED for this to be re-released on PC for years. I played the originals when they came out, still have my original PS3 copy.Pre-launch - I was super eager at the announcement of this release, and didn't even care about the $60 tag (Of course I was going to get both.) Tried to do some digging about the DLC content, and nothing was announced at all, so I just assumed they'd release it because why wouldn't they?Post-launch - Bought the game, and turned them on and dinked around for roughly 10 minutes. I'm not going to give the game itself a breakdown, you can play it for yourself (Most likely you already have). Game looks great considering its age, runs silky smooth, and the controls (Wired 360 controller) work very well. No problems whatsoever. I haven't tried the keyboard, nor do I plan to. A lot of reviews are slamming the controls and I can only assume it's for the keyboard or the Xbone controller. I have no issues. This game DOES come with the DLC characters from the PS3 version, which is very happy news! Game looks great and runs smooth at a constant 60 FPS. While this game lacks the polish that Ultimate Alliance 1 had, it's still a fun game. One of the things that is super weird is the audio. You can probably see in other reviews that this is a common issue. The music and sound effects have this constant weird crackling noise that is sometimes constant, and sometimes comes and goes. I have no idea what's going on, but it is very distracting. As mentioned before, the game lacks the same kind of TLC that the first had. They skimp on voice acting, and instead use written dialogue in a lot of places. The controls are a bit more floaty and don't feel as responsive (This isn't a controller issue, but a game design one.)Pros+ Silky smooth 60 FPS+ Graphics have aged well, look sharper+ Controls decent+ Lives up to the hype I remembered in the past+ DLC characters included!Cons- Price- Audio issues- Game itself lacks the polish of the firstWhile I enjoy the game itself, and have fond memories of it, I can't quite recommend others to get it for $40 (Or even $30 if you bundle it...) unless they are just wanting to turn the sound off. While that in and of itself isn't game breaking, the fact that this game was released as wonky as it was is disappointing. The DLC characters are definitely nice (WTF, why aren't they there in the first game!?) this game just isn't quite as great as the first, and the bugs make it harder to enjoy."

Launching the game I found that the game natually detected that I had a 1440p screen running at 144 hz, and I was getting a full 144 fps. Also it natually was using KB/mouse for control but upon trying to use my Xbox One Elite controller all of the tool tips switched over to XB1 buttons and worked flawlessly. I tried adding a second player with kb/mouse to test and everything seemed functional albeit the controls seemed awkward (I would heavily recommend using a controller for the game).The BadWhile this feels critical to put in the bad, the game is in no way a ""remaster"" of the game (nor does it claim to be). That said though the graphics are straight from 2009 and look like the belong on the Xbox 360. It would have been great to see a refresh of the game assets for more modern times but just know this is a port, not a remaster.Again I would also note here the controls for PC feel very awkward in the 10 minutes I tried playing with them.

Overall it plays a hell of a lot better than its predecessor, has nice clean UI, features 30 playable characters with 1 alternate costume each, better designed locations, more enemies to trash using the combo specials (2 heroes combine powers for a super attack, which replace MUA's ultimate moves), and a cameo from Stan Lee!I have to admit that the CGI scenes in this don't hold a candle to the first game's movie-quality CGI clips but this one doesn't suffer from those poor resolution cutscenes.

I loved this game way back when, and was looking forward to playing it on my PC. I really wasted my money. Keyboard/mouse players like me can't play this game. You cannot bind any mouse commands to anything but the game was kind enough to bind M1 and M2 to commands that would screw up if you used the mouse to initiate them. When it came to button mashing, which is required in order to advance at all, no matter how furiously I mashed the game would not accept the idea that I did anything at all. Only sometimes would I be able to right click (for whatever reason) and mash that right click to get anything done, until I got to a room in the second mission where the object I was mashing was to far back in the room so I couldn't interact with my mouse, which was really stupid. I tried using the camera to zoom in and see if that fixed it but the camera controls were flat out unresponsive. The controls are not intuitive at all even when they do work anyways. What do you think the button is to activate your third power when your first 2 powers wre ctrl+1 and ctrl+2? Not 3 silly, that's your jump button! It's ctrl+4. On top of all this I can run Overwatch at Ultra graphics without any fps lag but this game on low graphics with v-sync off had major fps lag for me. Until the mouse buttons can be bound or you can move the camera and the graphic settings page gets an overhaul, please DO NOT SPEND $40 on an already old game that even after it was ""fixed"" is still broken. I hope somebody who works on this stuff notices this, because I would gladly play it and spread the gospel of how good a game it is if these issues were fixed."

I use the XBox360 pad (wired) and the game is correclty mapped for that, other controllers I cannot speak for.Two issues I have however..The first issue is the quality of cut scenes is poor. . . but these are old games and to be honest the cut scenes are not important as far as gameplay is concerned in my opinion.The second is, given the age of the games I firmly believe the price is too much. A few months ago I got ""the Division"" for less than the cost of these older games. I am taking nothing away from the Marvel games, I still love them.

Did not come with the DLC and was not moddable like the original PC version of it.  I *do* have major distortion of the sound when I play MUA2, so I just turn it down and listen to music.  My controller works just fine, so I didn't run into that issue.  Graphics are great and definitely improved."

Of particular note is the new Fusion mechanic that substitutes in for the old Ultimates.+ Friendly AI that are not as dumb as bags of bricks+ The story, while not as massive in scope as the original MUA's, is just as interesting and engaging, with the eventual choice of sides giving it that much more replayability.+ The already diverse character roster is further enhanced by all 7 of the DLC characters: Black Panther, Cable, Carnage, Iron Fist, Juggernaught, Magneto and Psylocke.The game looks great, runs smooth and the keyboard controls are easily remapped.Definitely a happy recommendation."

Bought a Xbox one controller and everything I've done so far works without a problem.Update Review 1Even after the update the key bindings are incorrect. Using a wired X-Box 360 controller. Going to wait for the max time limit before I ask for my money back. Love the games, But it's a console port. The controllers should have been working. On my controller the LB and RB buttons don't work at all. And when they say press A, what they really mean is press X. To do what A should have done. In it's current state, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Just stay away from both of them at this point. I own the PS3 version of this. Did a side by side compare, and they look the same. Unless I'm missing some sort of advanced shading done. This isn't a remaster. It's a straight port. And they promised a remaster. As other have said it's missing DLC. I've never bought a remaster that didn't have all the DLC included. Can anyone say cash grab? I thought so."

Using an Xbox 360 wireless controller with a wireless receiver, I had XInput ready but I didn't have a need for it.The game is however still missing some scenes from the console versions and might still be missing content from PSP and Wii versions. There is a slight delay for the text prompts and the audio files you find, other than that though, the game is enjoyable and it pays good homage to the original version."

If you can get past the price tag, this version of MUA 2 is well done and runs perfectly.

Definitely worth a look into especially if it ever goes on sale."

I still kept tabs on the game and bought it again when I read that there was an update that fixed the issues.After playing for around 9 hours now, I think it's safe to say that the game is indeed much better. No more weird crackling sounds and the controls are okay (I'm using a 360 PC controller btw). I haven't experienced anything negative so far. Aaaand... I don't have the best eye for stuff like these, but still not sure if the graphics got better. Maybe during gameplay (Iron Man's armor seem... shinier, idk whatever :P), but the cut scenes look very pixelated to me.Game is still super fun as I remember it, also glad they included the DLC characters. I'm having tons of fun playing them since I wasn't able to do so on the console.If you're a big fan of the game or just want to play for the nostalgia, I think it's safe enough to pick it up right now. Or wait for a sale since yeah, price is still kinda ridiculous for an old game."

Wait for a sale to come along and snatch up both of the Ultimate Alliance games.Old review: This is a great game, marred by the horrendous controller support. By that, I mean there is none. There is no way to use your super powers, I even tried the controller input fix.I would love to change this review to a glowing one, but until this issue is fixed it will remain quite negative."

The controller support (or lack thereof) was an issue compounded by the release of a new driver with Windows 10 anniversary edition. As of the last patch, the xbox one controller finally works (with correct button fonts as well).My only remaining issue is the game is a bit on the pricey side considering the age.Despite the horrible launch state and the lengthy time it took them to resolve the controller issues, I am glad the game is now finally on PC.Pros:Graphics look great on PCSupports variable framerates (essential for 144hz+ support)Controls great (finally)Split storyline is great for multiple run throughsCons:Pricey"
,Recommended,433320,24551006,"Posted: 26 July, 2016",all,Retro Renegade,"I want to make this short and simple, as I haven't played much of this port to get into great detail about it, but here's what I've gathered.Pros:- As a game alone, I prefer the physics of this one over MUA1.- DLC characters included.- Good port outside of menus, gameplay functions great other than one thing I did notice, which I'll mention right below.Cons:- Dialogue audio cuts off before the end of characters' sentences. Can ruin the story.- Speaking of audio, I did not experience this myself, but I hear lots of people are having crackling issues.- Menus are mostly broken.- PRICE. If this was $15 or at the most, $20, I say it would be close to worth the cost with these issues, so long as they're going to be patched.- Multiplayer is completely broken. Immediately loses sync as soon as you begin your game.I am really scared that Activision is going to leave us in the dust, but it's only day 1. I haven't heard how the PS4/Xbone versions are, but I just really hope they'll get on patching the PC version immediately, as we deserve better for the price we paid for this game.I've played about 3 and a half hours of the campaign in the first game, and I go much more into detail with that one. This one didn't give me issues with choosing perks like in MUA1, but I did have problems messing around with the controls and trying to get a friend to join in on split-screen.Overall, from what I've played on this entry, I like MUA2 as a game maybe a little more than the first, but as a port, I prefer the first. The gameplay mainly seems to be intact and the story doesn't get cut off mid-sentence. Still, you don't get the DLC characters with that one. The other reviews will completely slam this game, and rightfully so. Both titles are a mess right now, but don't let it discourage you. They're still more than playable, and I still have hope that these games will be patched, and once they are, I think the $60 bundle will be worth it. But as it stands, I just can't recommend buying this at full price.EDIT:35 of 40 people found the above helpful. Changing my review will wipe that, but I feel the need to keep this updated. The crackling audio stuff seems to have been patched. The speech issue stems from what I believe is having a refresh rate above 60hz. Force it to 60FPS/enable vsync and that problem should be gone. The controller issues seem to be fixed, although it's still not compatible with my Afterglow controllers, which made it a pain to use a third party program in order to have my girlfriend join with said controller via an online game in MUA1. Overall, the state of the game now is playable. Not worth the asking price, but if by some miracle it goes on sale, I recommend it. I do applaud Marvel and Bill Rosemann for listening to us and fixing some of these big problems."

The controls are a bit wonkey but take a little time getting used to. If you do play this game i reccommend using a controler (Your preference). There is only one graphics option which are presets so you cant adjust them manually. But if you came for the same reason I did than using a controller might not just help the controls but it might make it even more nostalgic.
