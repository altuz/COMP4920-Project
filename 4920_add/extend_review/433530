76561198095934322,Recommended,433530,32770676,Posted: 25 June,all,willijdub,"Bottom line up front (BLUF): This game is highly addictive and very fun, I definitely recommend it. That being said, It does have a slight learning curve, and you should expect to put in about 20 hours or so to get really proficient at flying around, attacking enemies, being able to go toe to toe with the best players in PvP, developing strategies, and especially landing without exploding; and that is using a keyboard and mouse. Do not expect to start the game up as a newb and not get shot down 11ty times per game. It is not that hard, you are just new. (The controls are pretty straight forward, and easily mappable to any keys you like.) Take the time to learn it and you will absolutely enjoy this game!I have 116 hours in game now, and I have just switched to using HOTAS.  (I am using a Thrustmaster T16000M FCS Flight Pack)  I have never used a HOTAS before and this has added a great new dynamic to the game play for me, giving the game a bit more ""realism"" in flying. (I guess this could be considered ""simcade"" as it is NOT in depth like a true flight sim where you would need to study a user manual, and flip switches and such to even turn the engine on. It is very straightforward basic ""real"" controls as far as I can tell. An hour to learn, and we shall see how many more it will take to master.) While the game is arcade-ish and you can fly in either 3rd or first person (switching view on the fly) using a HOTAS can make this very fun game even more enjoyable! (But for a newb like me on the HOTAS, I went from being pretty damn good with the mouse/keyboard, to sucking, (I am having a blast though! That is just the learning curve for the HOTAS) If you are like me, and just getting into flying games, or especially helicopters, I would HIGHLY recommend getting a HOTAS for the higher level of immersion of flying. I put it off for a long time, and while as stated I went from being an excellent player to a crappy one, I feel like my skill will come up, but even a moderately good keybord/mouse user would dominate me right now. Half the fun is just flying though.One thing you MUST do is create new squadrons. You cannot expect to start the game and play well with the default squadrons! You can create a seemingly infinite number of squadrons (I have about 24 for different strategies and purposes) A squadron is 2-3 Helis based on a points cost system where each tier (first gen helis: gen 1, to modern helis: gen 4) has a different cap on the amount points you can use to create the squadron. You do not have to earn points, but rather it is just a way for the game to balance out players in each tier. So for example tier 4 (modern helis) has a point limit of 550. I could use my points for an attack chopper with missiles and ATGMs and all the bells and whistles.... but it is gonna cost me more than a transport heli. So you have to balance out your armament loadouts and types of helis and special troops for the different tiers of helis (Tiers 1-4), for both the Russians and US. You will spend some time figuring out what works and what does not. You will need to develop multiple squadrons for each tier that do different things such as a squadron with a heavy focus on troops or a heavy focus on attack helis. This allows you to choose a squadron appropriate for the match, as if you play multiplayer it is usually 1 vs 1 due to low player base. If you choose all attack helis, you will not have troops to deploy to capture bases and have no real way to win. If you play with a team, then you could go full on attack mode and not have any troops in your squadron as long as a teammate does. Again, you will have to figure out what helis and loadouts work when and where.PROS: Decent graphics, HOTAS support, good number of Helis to choose from and many different loadouts for weapons and troops. The player base while small, is very friendly, and will help you out in learning to play well. For a game that is only in version 0.51 (for those of you not so good at math, the game is only half finished) it is very well put together, with only a few minor bugs. The developers are continuously working on the game, patching things, updating things, adding new helis, and just all around making the game even better! You really cannot beat the cost either. I bought the game a while back when it was on like version 0.34 or something, and it was ten bucks. The Steam Summer Sale has it just under ten bucks for an even more developed game than when I bought it several months back. Another good thing about this game is that every heli can be test flown so you do not have to actually go into a battle. As for the different helis, it is not like some games where you have to ""unlock"" new weapons, or helis. All helis and weapons loadouts are available immediately to the player. (But as stated above you have to use your points wisely to make each squadron of helis.)CONS: In cockpit view, all helis, Russian or US, all have the same cockpit. No interior, just a windshield overlay. There is not a very large player base at all. (But again, the game is only on version 0.51 and is fun, just needs players!) The coop mode is kind of boring, but the PvP battles are simply awesome! There are no enemy bot helis in single player or coop. This sucks, but hopefully the devs will fix this in the future.If you like this game, flying games, or helicopters in general, I would highly recommend ""Air Missions: Hind"" as well."

Then the controls were wonky and the loading was a little slow. I got crashed frequently, I was instantly killed by enemies easily. My keystroke for 'W' was moving the heli backward instead of forward. I rage quit, I got frustrated and then just clicked on steam refund for this game and wrote a negative review. But I still didnt want to give up. I loaded up the game again and somehow managed to move past my base after a lot of trial and error. I am not sure how I went pass the weird control issues that I was having and from time to time it would resurface. But this time, I was not afraid. I was willing to grind. 20 Minutes into the game , I was flying really well. Along the way, through group chat, I learnt the meaning of a few statistics that showed up, frag, capture and something else. Soon I became immersed in the game. It was already an hour and time flew. I still didnt register a single kill and I died already 20 times. But it didnt bother, because I was already having the best time playing any game in my life. It was freaking awesome. This game is a beast when it comes to fun. Just buy it. 10 $ is nothing for this game. It is way underpriced for its potential. And I almost forgot to mention. I cancelled my steam refund and deleted my negative review, once my wife woke me up from my trance playtime."

There's no longer any reason to stay away from this game. The developer is EXTREMELY active and EXTREMELY talkative with this game. Matter of fact, I've spoken to him on several occasions about bugs and other issues I've noted, and all of them have been addressed at some patch or another! Buy the game already! Support this developer! He's a good one!(REVIEW EDIT:My initial thumbs up stands. This game, and everything it stands for, still has potential. Actually, it has a HELI-load of potential [pun-intended]! I'm now adding a few more items I've noticed that may need work, that's it!)I HIGHLY recommend this game. As an early access game, it's really fleshed out, better than most.

,Recommended,433530,34253474,Posted: 15 August,all,KapukiCram,"477 hours later.... i started to wish for more vic.... players.So i decided to write a great review to gather more pilots.THIS IS THE GREATEST GA.... ok that wont work.Yes the game is not perfect its EA and for 15€ keep that in mind, but if you are not blind you see that will be worth it : ).The game is inspired by so called ""vehilcular games"" but this time helicopters, this mean movement and orientation form 3rd person and most of the shooting from 1st person.Its has in it current state some PvP balance issues.But you can enjoy its PvE games.Make no mistake while the game has its realistic flightmodel approaches the game wants to acceable, so looking for a hardcore simulation is the wrong approach.In the future there will be more realism but i dont see it turning into a simulator (there is an advanced control mode maybe it can statisfy your simulation needs).While its more arcade it is not a brainoff game, i see a lot of player dying from carelessly flying around.But that is a good thing!Bring a bit of brain and you can enjoy the game.The game lacks atm ingame tutorials there are community tutorials but you have to look for them. (press F1 for the controls if you are ingame)Matches in this game are an hour long if the victory conditions are not reached, so compared other game there is more commitment needed.Overall its runs fine, but atm during the desync the hitdetection has its problems.At the moment the game has 5 maps 3 with the ""Frontline"" mode: You drop infantry at Landing Zones to capture it, tanks will move up this LZ and reinforce it and pave the way to the next one in the direction of the enemie base.The other mode is a ""Domination"" like mode also here LZ get captured by the infantry dropped from your helos and try to hold more than the other team long enough to fullfill their victory condtions.In both modes players fight with their helos over this LZ, But only helos which have infantry loaded can capture them.Attack helis like the AH-64 Apache will deliver destruction but they will not be able to win the game alone.Also there are atm three additional infantry types to deploy on the map which can support you and your team.OK thats it have fun!"

Hitboxes are not excellent.PlayerbaseYou can find matches online and have a lot of fun. Matches don't require a lot of players because this game is much more Strategy-Based than TPS.ConclusionThis game has a lot of potential and have the possibility to become better than A+++ but there is a lot of work to do.Negative reviews are made by people that give their first impressions and just looking at that menu i can feel them! but the important thing of all games is the gameplay and here you can have tons of fun. I also think that the main reason why developers are very slow developing the game is because they don't have money. Buy this game and let community grow. You won't regret it.(To be continued...

You need to shoot down enemy team players and take over said bases with your transported soldier guys. Occasionally you will need to destroy boat/car convoys.So far game dos not have many servers or maps and with no real progression it can get boring. But it features quiet a lot of different helicopters from Mi-8 up to Apache.Dev team is very communicative and listen to player feedback - game is worth investing if you like some casual helicopter fun. Lots of potential."

This game is clearly unfinished, but those are my opinions about it.PROS+An already vast choice of helos to choose from, and all of them are different between the others.+Very distinct and separated roles, that heavily encourage cooperation between your teammates. Ah, don't try to shoot down an attack helicopter with that Blackhawk, ok?+Weapons are already simulated pretty well: bullets have their speeds, and no, it's not a hit detection fault that you can't hit anything, it's just that you have to LEAD your enemies. Unguided Rockets are simulated very well for an alpha.+Friendly devs, open to critics and suggestions. I also became a friend with one of them, so you can guess it yourself.+Very good balancing between helos of different teams.+Requires SKILL, and not just LUCK.+Graphics and effects are nice for such an alpha state.+Vietnam and Afghanistan.+Intuitive and easy controls+Flying is realistic to an extent, but not too much to become a simulator, flight mechanics are simple but most realistic maneuvers can still be used. Physics aren't bad.+Devs are litterally machinegunning us with updates, Never seen a dev team that fast.+Perfectly balanced pricetagLike any game in this universe, Heliborne has it'sCONS-Team Balance is a bit awkward. Sure, you can win alon vs 2 players if you're good, but it's annoying.-It still has a young and scarce community, not so much people playing.-Sounds aren't as good as the graphics-Some helos are bit overused, even if it's not a developing issue-Minor bugs.-No AH64 | Asiimov Factory New (Joking)________________________________________VerdictSo, Heliborne is still young and has it's problems. Considering it's current status, it's almost impressive to see such an already fun and enjoyable Alpha. I'm sure all the CONS i've stated will be fixed or worked on, since our devs are really working hard to make this game become a good indie.In my opinion, those are 10 bucks well spent. But don't get here and write a negative review because you bought it without being interested in rotary wing aircrafts.Score: Considering it's current state, i give Heliborne 9.2/10"

It's one of my favourite games of the genre.The (current: 19.4.2017) lack of any grind (other than rank, decals and different helmets for your profile that you can get simply by playing the game) is a thing that will split people's opinions. In my opinion it doesn't affect the game that much, since it's current state is far from refined.The game doesn't have that much active players, but I've always found battles to participate.Hit registering is by all standards poor, so don't expect that thing to work well even if you have good internet. If you don't like games that are under development don't buy Heliborne, just yet. But all of you people that can play a little buggy games, should buy Heliborne, absolutely!"

Extremely well. I was expecting to break out my joystick or controller. Didn't have to. There's a nice selection of choppers to pick and era locked on one of the 3 maps you can pick. Right now there is no competitive modes or unlocks or loadouts which I do kinda of liek the fact that the choppers are preset. In a way this game kind of reminds of Fractured Space. It's sorta of MOBAish. Right now there's only one game mode where your team takes over or establish the bases and reienforces them. But this has a nice laid back casual vibe and so does the current community.  I look forward to see what comes to this game.

Personal opinion, wish i could set up a private lobby and restrict certain things (i.e. the tiers of choppers or possibly no special troops, or only certain types etc etc)2.5 follow through of previous statement. Not alot of maps to play on, and the ones that are available are specifically setup for that ""Generation"" of Chopper.

So it may or may not relate to most non mac users but just in case*I first heard/saw of this game through youtube and many gamer blogs there that highlighted this game. My last experience in terms of ARCADE/SIM aerial combat was through War thunder but that was F2P, What attracted me to this game was the concept of it plus I also have a bit of interest in helicopters (Personal faves are the littlebird and Huey as well as the blackhawk) Seeing a game like this despite the influx of Realism FPS based games, it was a breathe of fresh air seeing something like this.After my first playthrough I was almost about to return it. Reasons being that : Cant unlock more aircraft yet, lack of game modes, lack of maps, lack of users at times. However, I had a second thought that this game is just in EARLY ACCESS so therefore many more features and improvements will come in the future (Hopefully) so I stuck with it.After getting to used to whats available now, im kinda glad I kept this game instead of returning it. Im playing it on a borrowed Macbook Air and so far so good under custom low settings (I keep my textures and detailing Medium to High depending) also if youre not too into or willing to bear with it, the framerate is decent for my laptop. The game however is a bit challenging, its not simply fly around and kill everyone thats not on your side, youre basically playing the support role that most of these helicopters to, from landing troops and special troops in cap points to supporting other team mates when theyre doing the same to attack or defending. You gotta strategize and work with your team mates to win the day....when your playing against other human players lol (No bots just yet)It can be forgiven to be a bit mad at first buying this game and seeing little features but piece of advice? Its in early access so during that time many improvements can be made to a game before its final release, good example would be Day Of Infamy for those that got it during early access as well)I wont go that much into negative details (Its tough to fly these things but then again, im willing to learn hahaha) but if youre more into arcade fast action stuff this wont be your cup of tea but if you are into military stuff then this might be up your alley. I recommend getting this game and sticking with it during the EARLY ACCESS stage. Its got good potential."

With it being early in development I'm not hating on the little bugs here and there, even so the devs fix many of these issues as soon as they can. The game itself gives a good feel to it, imagine your one of the pilots in the helo assault in Apocalypse Now, its great...but add in the other teams helo's trying to kill you while you assault ground forces, its glorious.As of the time of posting, these are the pros n cons.Pros:Great variety of aircraftfairly balanced aircraft (ruskies n Muricans)historicly accurate aircraft (you can't fly an Apache in early Vietnam, but you can in Afghanistan)Air combat is a skill...not a easy thing.Flying physics are very nice.Cons:All the first person cameras are the same cockpit...no matter what aircraft you use...Trees don't make you explode...Chaff/flares don't work for♥♥♥♥♥♥half of the time...Door gunners don't shoot, I was really hoping I could hover around an area in a Huey and have m60 gunners firing...naaOver all I love this game, its more then likely going to get tons better. Suggestions: Make door gunners work, more variable dismount's (when you land at firebases/villages, you dismount soldiers to take the position, along with Stinger missile teams. Maybe offer anti tank teams). More gamemodes.For later, maybe offer some fixed wing craft like the A-1 Sky Raiders or A-6 intruders...russian equiv like the Frogfoot or such. All sub sonic aircraft...Thats my input, so far I'm loving the game, I'd suggest buying it.EDIT: Months later, and I'm happy to say...the devs listened. Door gunners are here, and many more features that make the game amazinger. Buy it now. Play it."

This game has A LOT of potential. It's just not there. The selection of helicopters is impressive, the gameplay is fun, and the graphics are acceptable. The controls are a bit clunky at first, but once you get them down it's pretty easy.In it's current form, this game doesn't have any kind of progression, unlocks, or reward system. This is all fine and dandy, but there's not much in the game to hold my attention and dedication. I'm not saying this game needs to be a grindfest, but I feel there needs to be a goal to put effort towards (other than simply having fun).My biggest complaint is that the UI is extremely confusing. Friendlies have red/orange icons... This would be ok if there wasn't Friendly Fire, but there is, and I get shot in the back all the time.I have very high hopes for this game. The arcade style controls and gameplay are fairly easy to grasp and there's enough diversity within to allow many types of play. At present, it just feels hollow. I'm going to give this game my recommendation for the time being, as I'm banking that the added funding will help spur development."

It is something that is enjoyable by yourself or with friends. If you have friends who play this it is very easy to jump into a match with with or against your friends and have a great round of gameplay that is different each time. Even though there are few maps at this time August '17 the game play changes from match to match enough to make it playable for many hours.

Updated engine, better frames, more helicopters, more maps, new game mechanics that make this game fun.  The only slight complain I have is that they are separating the game sessions by server location and they should merge them, but leave a small label to say where the game is hosted. That way everyone sees everyone and can join any game without having to go back to the main menu and change the server.Save for that, I strongly recommend this game!In the interest of ethics and showing how this game has changed, I'll leave the prior review.______________________Completely recommended. It is one of those games you pick-up and don't want to stop playing. I think that sentence should be enough to tell you how fun it is. But just in case, currently, there are 3 maps covering Early Vietnam war, Late Vietnam war, and Modern Age, yes that includes Huey's, Mi24's, Havoc, Apache, Blackhawk, Chinook, and many others! The system of capturing FOB with deploying troops, and reinforcements to help in FOB is one of the best ideas I've ever seen too. Buy this game, I can't stress enough how amazing this is!The updates are constant, and the development is on time, and to top it all, the dev team is one of the most friendly and active in a community I've ever seen.

Who wouldn't love to fly around shooting and deploying troops???I give this game 9/10.Because as of now there is no proper tutorial or map where you can fly by yourself and test helicopters, though still, it's early access.Would definetly recommend to anyone.11/07/17 (11th July 2017)I reviewed this game more than a year ago and since then it has been updated a ton. Firstly, there is now a ""firing range"" map to test helicopters which is just awesome. Also, the servers are alot more active and are continuinig to grow. Even if you can't find a server, now you can play single player missions with procedurally generated taks solo or with friends for a total of four players (I think).In addition to game changes, there is now new maps such as the Afghanistan, Khost Province and Balkans, Kosovo. Creating squadrons is now improved and cosmetics and ranking have been implemented. Cosmetics include; helmets, stickers, medals and ribbons. As well as trading cards for badges.From what I know there is still no interactive in-game tutorial, however I am sure this will be implemented by the time it is out of early access and you can use the test map to practice anyway.In conclusion, I believe that this game has come along way since first appearing on Steam and ,for an early access game, it has a lot of content. The developers are very active and should have your full support. I would fully recommend that you buy this game (£11 is pretty good, might go up when it comes out of early access) and if you dislike it, just get a refund! This game will definitely appeal to people interested in helicopter aviation and/or historic wars like Vietnam but everyone should try it. At current I want to give this game at 10/10, but I will give it a 9/10 because they need to try and advertise the game more so that the servers are more active. I fully support this game and it's developers, thanks for reading."

You can set your own level of difficulty and game parameters and let others join.The devs are always on the discussion boards and sometimes in game and are very quick replying to suggestions (2hrs to my query) There are a lot of future plans and I can see a great future. Thoroughly recommend. An early access game that outplays some full titles..... well worth the cash.Just to add if you are good at PvE, be it resupplying forward bases or taking out colums of tanks, you can not only excel in co-op but turn the tide of the teambased PvP.

The involvement of both Crew and Ground Troops really gives a great sense of immersion throughout the gameplay. The rapid pace of deployment and general tempo of a battle really suits the nature of Helicopter combat situations and balances really well with the Arcade style of the game.  A real sense of progression can be felt when moving through the Vietnam era Helicopters such as the UH-1D through to the more modern combatants such as the ACH-47 Chinook which is exceptionally fun to fly. Equally the Mi-24V and AH-64 D where also two standout vehicles that were great to take out into battle, with both offering very aggressive and offensive styles of play. Of the 3 main classifications, (Attack, Assault and Recon) Recon seemed to be the weakest (From a balance and fun perspective) and least played class. Currently they have very little impact or function within a battle while the Assault and Attack where much closer in terms of general fun and effectiveness in combat.The maps are good in terms of design and spacing with the overall graphics being very respectable at this early stage. Lots of lighting effects and visual detail really made many aspects stand out. Whilst the graphics are far from perfect at such an early stage, they do not deduct from the gameplay or fun elements of the game.The prospect of customization, unlocks and progression throughout the game does present an interesting array of concepts and ideas that can really benefit the game once in a more solid state. The range of weaponry and arms available as well as the variants of Helicopters currently in game set the stage for some really interesting outcomes down the line.In terms of development, I think the main focal point really needs to be the UI and interface in general. Lots of the HUD elements feel clunky and deduct from the gameplay due to their somewhat outdated feel. Key components such as the map feel underused and irrelevant, whilst the chat is very pertrusive and often clashes in front of the Helicopter whilst in combat. Team leaderboards and some of the menus in particular feel veryAdditionally, the Ground Targets found at hostile bases are very unpredictable in a sense of comprehending how to effectively attack and combat them. Some seem to instantly down an attacking Helicopter whilst others seem to do very little. More complexity and diverse situations will obviously come over time, however attention is needed in terms of Air-to-Ground combat as this is a key factor of any battle engagement.Overall the game is fantastic fun to play and has a very interesting gameplay style that suits the pace of Helicopter warfare perfectly."

In my original review I expressed my (and many others) issues with hit detection, after playing a few matches on the recent update I haven't noticed much issue with it. However, team balance is still being looked into, and I'm excited to see what the devs do!Not very many people are fond of Early Access titles because of money grabs (most recently H1Z1), I'm a little wary myself, but I also think it's a great platform for new devs to create their vision to get out there quickly and let the gamers shape it into something everyone can enjoy!

You have two sides (Russian/American) spanning the 1960s to now. As of this review (the day after release) there's only 3 maps. Two Vietnam era and one Russian Afghan era.The helicopters feel like they should. My personal favorite is the Mi-24 Hind from the Afghan level. That thing will take a beating before it goes down.So what you do to capture a base is land your heli and deploy the troops you have carrying with you. Some helicopters carry a whole lot of troops, some carry none. The helicopter you pick depends on the role you want to play.There are definitely things that need to be worked on, like sound glitches, the spawns inside buildings glitch and some other issues, but that's what you get for alpha level. On the whole, this is a very playable game and absolutely worth the $10 to play it, knowing it will get better with time.Also, for you flight enthusiats, this game is very much arcade-y in feel, not sim level. You can get away with flying like a pro with a mouse+keyboard. And that's okay. I'm happy with a fun game, not a flight sim.If you like WoT type games, check this out. You won't be disappointed."

A LOT. it requires too much resources, which could make the gaming experience a bit less fun over time.there is no auto balance. even if the game will not let you join a ""too strong"" team when joining. it doesn't auto balance the teams during the game. you could get left 5v1 when all your team mates leave. thus, this can be a pain in the ..... over time.being a new game, there aren't thousands of servers/matches online, and sometimes there isn't a match going on at all unless you start it. (but, the community is growing, and the mods are doing their best for it to grow, like handing out free game keys. so this might be someting for the pros list)overall;the game is a solid 7/10 with a potential of turning into a 10/10 very soon, due to the effort of the devs and moderators. this game, as a helicopter battle sim, is worth the purchase."

NOW with a Kosovo map and a bunch of new additions and bug fixes. Many of the choppers can drop troops/MANPADs. Each chopper also has primary (mg) and secondary (Rockets/ATGMs) armaments and multiple load outs. Gameplay revolves around landing on helipads to deliver troops to fortified positions scattered throughout each map. The fight model is relatively arcade but is fun and fairly easy to pick up. Worth considering if you enjoy vehicle shooting games and like rotorcraft.Overall: A bit rough around the edges but, shows potential. A charming little helicopter game.

Overall, positive and good balance between simple game play and playable controls. Because it is a helicopter game of course it takes some understanding; with a game pad I was able to get the jist of flying within 15 minutes and from then on I went onto win a game against a computer (without enemy aircraft of course). I like the game mechanics of base capture, dropping off personnel to man or re-inforce the base defenses. It reminded me of an updated 3D Choplifter or Rescue Raiders (if you are old like me, you recognize these names) And the combat I thought was fine. Graphics were quite good and you could feel the difference between the various copters. Overall fun and hit the right level of simplicity vs authentic-feeling mil sim that I wanted.On the negative side, the UI to actually get into the game could be greatly simplified. I spent maybe 5 minutes trying to figure out how to actually jump in and play and was almost ready to give up before I stuck with it. Also for some reason with game pad  I could not put my cursor on my size of screen; fortunately I could revert to mouse for the interface clicking.The biggest negative is that I did not find any US servers except one; so I had to content myself to learn the game by myself - though it did help me learn how to fly without someone constantly killing me. I will definitely look for future updates as I content myself with bombarding enemy vehicles and bases while I learn how to fly better."

Controls are splendid: easy to learn, intuitive, responsive and most importantly...immersive. While not a simulation by any stretch of the imagination (nor pretends to be one) , the controls make you feel you're actually flying a helicopter, and not some random vehicle which just happens to have a helicopter shape. Different models show how well the system work...you can feel the agility and flimsyness of an OH6 while you'll have to always keep in mind the slow controls and huge inertia of a MI-8 if you happen to be flying one.Speaking of which, there's a ton of helicopters already in game, and more to come in the future. From UH-1s to Seahawks, from Cobras to Apaches, from Hinds to Havocs...lots of them, with different weapon configurations, different flight characteristics, different roles, different traits.This game is shaping into really, really, really good stuff.Now don't get me wrong - it's early access and in some places it shows. UI could be better, optimization could also be better, etc. But that's the kind of stuff you'd expect to be a work in progress in a game in early access. As long as the core gameplay is solid, the developers are good, and the idea has merit, who cares about those minor issues that will get fixed in due time, right?.Well, the core gameplay is very good, the idea is great, the developers should be role models for most gaming companies. They're passionate about the game, always looking for player feedback, and always ready to take that feedback and turn it into something good for the game. I'm not one to sugar coat games, but this one definitely deserves to hit it big.If you like games like War Thunder or World of Tanks or World of Warships,then you'll enjoy this game A LOT...while not having to swear all the time at the developers. Best of all worlds.Finally, I see a lot of ""negative"" feedback in the comments. All of them share the same common thing: ""Game's great, but few players around"". Well...you're not helping out by giving a negative opinion, right?. Is not as if you say ""don't get it"" we'll get more players to improve the situation...Yes, there is a very limited playerbase at the moment. That's an issue, and sometimes you won't be able to play because there's noone around. The issue does exist - but the game IS great and IS worth it. Hence, I give a strong thumbs up and I really advice anyone who likes this kind of game to immediately get it...then the ""few players"" problem will be no more, right? :)."

It is near impossible to practice if a player is shooting at you :)Other than that, the game is pretty solid. It does not have shiny super graphics, but it holds together. It is fairly enjoyable, and you'd miss something not getting this little game :)"

The problem about the game, and guys I know it's still in Beta, but this is advice for the Devs for future updates, so my first problem is that the Audio sounds very very... icky, like with the MI-28, it sounds like a broken drum, and for the minigun can stay in it's original position. The second problem is that you should change the deployable troops in the Afganistan to like Modern Day, because 1960's Vietnam G.I. soldiers in the middle of Afganistan does not make any sense at all. So for my final verdict, I will give this game a 8/10 because it's an absoulute blasting game, but this game is still in like Beta mode which I understand and stuff is getting taken care of."

You and your team will face off against others to capture FOBs on any given map. These bases are armed with AA emplacements that can make your Copter scrap metal in seconds. Land your Chinook after laying waste to the bases defenses and let your infantry take the base for your team. Each helicopter fills a role, from air-assault, attack or multi-role.

However, you can tell clearly in the first 20 minutes of playing it yourself that the game truly is pre-alpha.Textures and models are still very basic, which is suprising considering the performance of this game.Not very active multiplayer. Obviously the game just came out, but the servers are created by the players (not certain if it opens a dedicated server or if it runs client side), they chose the map and will be the first to chose team and heli. Team balance was non-existent when I played, you could have 8vs1 match if you want but it is no fun. My entire first hour was spent getting into quick matches where players would stack one side.Bad control design. This is coming from a heavy-sim pilot though so if you like arcade flight models (like in War Thunder Arcade), this is probably okay for you to ignore. I feel like if they make it a bit more fluid and challenging, it will become a more attractive game but that is just my two cents.The weapon armament comes in presets. That's great for balancing purposes but I was slightly disappointed as I would have loved to put 12 Vikhr AGMs and then stupid rockets for the Ka50 like I do in DCS.Oh and one critical piece of info, the hit detection is really shady right now. This is what caused me to just say, ""screw it. I'll refund and hold off on this game for a couple months"".So yea, the idea is great and there is a nice selection of birds at every era (across 3 maps) but the game is just not really ready for an early access release. It might be better in a few days, weeks, or months, but that is never garunteed when you buy Early Access titles which this being a brand new developer team, it is really hard to garuntee they will get the funding and expertise to make this game have a solid quality to it. That said, I hope they can make it far better soon. I did enjoy the game, but I have more fun at the moment just flying 10 meters off the ground in a DCS helicopter in Nevada."

There are not enough people playing it, i counted 1 server in the US with 14 people on and 1 server in EU with 4 people on.Yep thats right, 1 server for the entire EU continent with only 4 people in total playing, the US server was laggy and randomly closed after 10 minutes of playtime (host probably left the game, more on that later).The gfx and sfx are quite poor too, there are only 3 maps, games can take forever, and that is before we even start with the controls. They are terrible. Nothing feels fluid and it doesnt feel like any helicopter i have ever flown in any game, ever, it just feels clunky and weird. Real helicopters do not have a forward or reverse control, to go forward you tilt the nose down, to slow or reverse you tilt the nose up. Simple. So why do we have an accelerator and a brake in this game? It doesnt make sense.The gameplay (when i finally found a server with enough people for a match) feels boring, the combat is seriously lacking and for me it just doesnt feel fun at all. You can clearly see people being killed frequently, but when you look at the scoreboard, you realise that the AI gets 95% of the kills in this game. Usually the seriously OP AA missiles. Kinda defeats the object of a multiplayer team game doesnt it?Did i mention all the servers are run by the players? There are no dedicated servers at all, meaning the players have to create the games, which in return means any game you manage to join can close down at any time. Neither is there any team balance. It seems to be normal to be in 6v3 or 7v3 matches. This, and never knowing if you are even going to get to finish a match let alone win, becomes old very quickly.Then there is the hit detection, which is quite broken. You can shoot at players and can clearly see the impact of the munitions, but nothing happens. Then the sound will disappear for no reason...Requested a refund, will check back later this year and see if anything has changed and improved. I feel there is quite a lot of work to do yet.Edit: I keep hearing how there are loads of people playing this game with multiple full servers and i am just talking nonsense, but here are the facts.The peak player count yesterday was 38, that is over the EU, US and Asia servers combined, and the player numbers have been steadily dropping since the games release which is worrying.https://steamdb.info/app/433530/graphs/It might be a decent game in the future, but for me at the moment, it is just a little bit too early access yet. Keep watching youtube videos, keep up to date with updates, and more importantly track the playercount.If you have money to spend and really want to support the development, then by all means go ahead and buy it, but if you have a limited budget to buy a game i would suggest you buy something else."

This seems to be a rather bad game of an interesting concept.Now, I did buy the game and my final verdict is:This game looks good, plays okay for an arcade controls helo game and it sure does catch my interest.So, what is Heliborne all about?Simply put, you're the helicopter part of the game World in Conflict.You take out hostile units and emplacements and deploy troops to fortify your own positions.The basic formula is not hard to grasp, the execution ranges from easy to strategic.It just depends on how you want to play the game.Another nice feature is the option to choose with what kind of helicopter you want to fly and how you want to arm it.Ofcourse, to keep things balanced you aren't allowed to pack twenty machineguns on a Kiowa.But, the more firepower you pack, the more valuable your ride becomes leaving even less room for errors to minimize respawn. (Which is a nice feature)Getting shot down doesn't really give you a penalty, besides a respawn timer which is pretty fair and doesn't really hurt your ego, to put it that way. But, as soon as your tax dollar ride goes up in flames you know that your team lost a valuable asset which can't be used for a couple of minutes and that might change the entire scenario.So, does this game have potential?Forget that, it's already potent in its current form and the developers aren't done yet.Buy this game if you like helicopters, don't need simulator realism and if you want to have a nice twist regarding the battlefield franchise."

My problem is with one simple issue with the game, the hit detection if awful, and I know the devs are hard at work trying to fix it, but I have simple standard for even EA games that should be filled for me to actually recommend a game. Let me give a more detail explaination to just how bad my one issue with the game translates into a horride time playing.First off, almost everything else in the game is great for its current state of development is great, love the detail of the helicopters, like the options to change a weapons loadout, the roles of different helicopters, seperation of the helicopters by different eras, all good.Its more of major flaw in the primary game mechanic that kills it, and i mean absolutely kills it. The game seems to only favor rockets for A2A or miniguns on select few US helicopters. The rockets are a spam and pray for a hit, while the miniguns only seem to be effective due to the rate of fire. Try playing with 12.7mm ""machine guns"" and you will wonder if you are shooting blanks. The matter even gets worse the more you play and notice it.I have shot duel  machine guns, or even duel 30mm cannons at hovering helicopters while in level flight and nothing happens to the target. I wonder still if I was doing something wrong til others mentioned the same issues in game chat. Once I saw a helicopter slowly line up to land troops, and im mean SLOWLY. I spun around above to loose speed and come to a hover above him and started to fire 40mm gernades from the turret at him, but to my shock, every round showed a direct hit, but no damage taken. I tried the same thing with the vast majority of weapons in game, and in its current state, its simply broken.Seeing how combat is THE feature of this game, and its not working as intended, then I would avoid this game, but only until the matter is fixed. Once they fix hit detection and if you are a fan of helicopters in any way, then it would practically be a crime not to play this game."

I like that the combat is not centered around shooting each other in helicopter, but it is about covering your ground forces( important to note: the game is not giving too much sense to do this, so everybody is just playing team deathmatch, which is still fun). It is full of balancing issues, but thats okay, as far as I know the devs are aware of this and they are working on this. And yeah servers are empty but you can find a good game sometimes.HOWEVER! after spending some more time with the game, it is EXTREMELY riddled with balancing issues. I get it its early access, and realism but when the US team gets constantly rekt because the russian ka-52s and hind outturn them, carry AA missiles while the americans practically can only carry ATGM, outrun them, they are more durable WHILE they are carrying soldiers to cap bases.Final verdict: I would still recommend the game but be aware of the flaws of the gameplay. Fun game nevertheless."

It is not even bad. It's just purely non-existent. With a bit of luck you'll be hitting AI positions or players standing still, but you can forget any kind of dogfighting or shooting at moving targets. It simply does not work the absolute majority of the time. And not even point blank. You're gonna see your shots hitting, but they just won't register. Sucks the fun right out pretty quickly.For those wondering I was playing with a stable ping of 30ms and no apparent packet loss. The issue lies with the games servers that appear to be some of the worst I have ever encountered. Or in the worse case in the game's netcode which in this state will be one hell of a long haul to fix.I realize it is early access and i have closed both eyes, but from a PvP arena shooter which this game basically is, this state of things is just unacceptable.TL;DR: Core mechanics (namely hit register) broken to pieces atm, I reccomend you save your money.EDIT: As per the developers response I suppose waiting a couple days is the least I can do. However my opinion remains unchanged. In it's current state I cannot reccomend the game. And let's just put the emphasis on the word ""current"".EDIT 2: It is now after the first batch of patches and the hit detection issue still prevails. But there has certainly been an improvement and the devs are at work. It is still far from a state where I would call it reliable and reccomend the game. But I now have hopes it might get there some day. On that day I'll start reccomending the game, but right now I still can't do that."

,Recommended,433530,24054313,"Posted: 3 July, 2016",all,Arashenstein,when i bought this game it really had nothing to offer for $10 so i refunded it and also i was expecting a chopper simulator game where i can use my flightpads but unfortunatly not only this game does not support any type of controller as developer announced it. it also does not even need controller or joystick infact this game is designed for mouse and keyboard so even if one day it supports joystick it forces u to go for mouse and keyboard because it is how the flight system is designed you control the chopper nose + main gun and direction with the mouse not any other button.the controls are extremly easy and you dont need more than 2 minutes to learn how to fly a helicopter it is not a simulator at all so if you are not a flight fan but you wanna try this game then do it because it is completley different than simulation games.Pros: good graphics + good sound + good map design + tones of helicopters each with different gameplay styleCons: no single player + no AI mode + no COOP mode where two people can be gunner and pilot instead of using 2 different helicopters (like battlefield and gunship) + you have no choice over what game mode and helicopter you want to play as because it is only MP and if the server is running 60's era war you can only choose the 60's helicopters and if it is modern time you can choose AH-64D for example there is no way you can choose your favourite helicopter it is all depended on server settings and this game is nearly dead in MP so it means you basically can enjoy the main menu mosf of the times.

It has great heart and thought into the many helicopters being represented within and the games machanics are very fun! Especially trasnferring troops to FOBs. But unfortunately its just not for me. The controls are very stiff and heavy, feels as though there are constant restrictions place on the flight mechanics to stop you from truly controlling your helicopter. I couldn't role or pitch at extreme angles which made the controls very sluggish and the trottle and cyclic pitch system is difficult to adapt to, so your constantly battling with the choppa for altitue or pitch.I don't understand how its HOTAS supported when It recognises my X-52 but i have to configure it entirely. And that was a challenge in itself due to the terrible lack of instructions, guides or ingame hints. In the end support had to point me in the direction of a simple misunderstanding . Which could have been avioded had they just made it clearer.The games missions and maps are incredibly fun to play and like i mentioned before, the details in the choppa designs and payloads is brilliant. The game has ALOT of potential once the flight controls are improved. But as I'm on a budget I cannot wait that long. I'll definately keep an eye on this game!"
