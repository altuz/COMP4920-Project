,Not Recommended,433600,22889608,"Posted: 9 May, 2016",all,TRUEfoe,"There are good things and bad things about A Legend of Luca.  You can tell that the developer listens to his audience.  Originally the game was designed as being ""a room-scale vr game"" and after feedback, they have changed the game to teleportation controls.  I originally purchased this as I was intrigued by the thought of actually having to move around the room to play a game.  This wasn't ideal however when put into actual play, as the floor was set to be at waist level and you kind of felt like a god floating in the sky shooting at tiny beasts and skeletons.  I gave the game a break.The developer then came out with new enhanced controls and scaled the game to be true size.  This seemed like a step in the right direction, but I had such difficulty fighting even the first boss using teleportation.  It felt like it needed much more tweaking.  Maybe this is just a knock against VR locomotion in regards to a fast paced action adventure game, but having to turn around after teleporting to fight a boss can get very disorienting.  I want to like this game, I really do.  The graphics and the amount of work the developer has put into the game is there; it just needs a tiny bit of extra work before I can give it my seal of approval.Thank you for reading my review."

(7 mars 2017)Scale has been adjusted, ceilings has been added, weapons and music has been enhanced. Now It's more engaging, more immersive as VR deserves it. It feels right and fun to crawl thoses dungeons although sometimes a little bit repetitive... worth it in the end."

This results in a room that is 6 times as wide and long to run around in.  This lets them put more objects and enimies in a single room.  It kind of feels like you're running around on a game board with real traps and enemies, which is very cool!  It's hard to explain, but very well executed IMHO.  I find that I am more active (running around) in this game than any other that I've played except for maybe Space Pirate Trainer (and I've played almost all of them).The combat is pretty straight forward.  You start off with a magic staff that shoots energy balls in the direction you point it.  You have bombs that blow up blocks like in Zelda.  You eventually get a malee weapon for your second hand and thats when it gets real intense.  That's as far as I've made it so far, but I can't wait to get the other weapons and give them a go.I highly recommend checking it out if you're into a Zelda-type dungeon crawler that is focused on action.  There isn't really any story to speak of, other than some short narration, but hardly a deal breaker in my book.Main take-away:  VERY FUN!!!"

You navigate through a Zelda dungeon like map collecting treasures and new weapons with a real feeling of exploration compared to most VR games in which you teleport around that often breaks immersion.However, my gameplay experience was very different from the trailers and screenshots. The store page says the minimum requirement for this game is 2m x 1.5m but I later found the 'Additional notes' section which says the ideal play area is 4m x 2.35m. My play area is 2.7m x 2.7m and the world was scaled down so much that it felt very different from the trailers and screenshots. This downscaling caused difficulty in navigating through the room and avoiding enemy attacks. I think the minimum space requirement should be changed so that players get the intended experience rather than compromising the gameplay by scaling everything down.The game itself looks great and I believe it would be quite enjoyable if I had the recommended play area, but I wasn't able to get the expected gameplay experience with the space available to me."

I'm looking forward to future updates.A few things I think would make the game better include:-Not having to read every scroll every session to find out what they are since many of them are harmful-The bow is cumbersome to use, especially given how well some other games implement bows. I think a hand crossbow would be thematically appropriate and mechanically more consistent with how the bow is used in this game.-The melee sword simply passes through creatures, which is counterintuitive. It would be great if it provided a little knockback of the target and vibrated the controller to provide a tactile sensation with each hit."

Be aware that this is NOT A Binding of Isaac!  You will notice that the average reviewer has put in approximately 1-2 hours on this game.  This is for one simple reason: for me to fail once, then complete the game took approximately one hour.  This includes ransacking every single room and searching all sections of each level.That is, in all truth, the biggest flaw in this game; it is really more of a demo of how to begin a true VR game rather than mini-game.  Some other drawbacks are the difficulty many are having with making this truly room-scale as well as some of the weirdness with hit-boxes.Even with all that said, I would still highly recommend this game as it is deeply satisfying for that one hour and, especially if you pick it up on a sale as I did, it costs less than going to a movie or grabbing appetizers with friends.  It is deeply immersive with intuitive controls and a fair amount of variety considering the recycling of skins from other games."

The later levels are fairly challenging, and although it's not a game I play terribly often, it's a reliable 20-30 minutes of fun to do a single run.The game definitely needs a revamp of its HUD/menu: it's a little too high up and isn't easy (if at all possible) to read. Sometimes you just have to go with the randomness of your sprawling inventory without actually knowing what it is, particularly at higher levels.I haven't tried the comprehensive mod for this yet, but I imagine it'll be a refreshing take on the game when vanilla has run its course.

The particle effects, though pretty, tend to make it hard to see what's going on. Both the disorienting strafe and teleportation movement methods feel jerky and unrefined. There's also the inexplicable design choice to allow players to move through obstacles unhindered but force their weapons to stay behind.The swords-and-sorcery angle is skin-deep, because at its heart this thing is 100% a shooter. You shoot your magic staff. You shoot your axe. It's weird. It feels more like an arcade bullet hell game than a roguelike.The 8-bit graphics and chiptune music are out of place among the smooth 3D models and realistic sound effects.It's clear a lot of effort and talent went into the game, and the production values are quite high. I really want to like it, but it's just not one of the better VR games out right now."

The first time through it's pretty crazy, you miss fire alot with button presses. Still trying to get comfortable with the controls. I'm ducking projectiles and teleporting around rooms.  The monsters are very cartoony and fun. It's crazy when things are the same size OR way bigger, the first boss fight was a total blast. One of the few games so far that you can sort of explore around a bit also. There isn't much to find though. I'm hoping they add pressure plate buttons switches and other stuff like that.

Rogue-like with randomly generated levels means a different experience each time-Intensity. That first time when the boss charges you and you jump into a wall to dodge do you realize how real it can feel. You can definitely work up a sweat.-Fun. Hard to put into words but you it feels like you're living the Legend of Zelda-Items lots of fun items in a similar vein to Binding of Issac (including one that changes your vision to wire-frame)-Weapon variety. Several different weapons can drop for you and since you can wield you two weapons there are quite a few combinations. I like the sword and staff (I like to think of it as Ganddalf style)I have not unlocked all the weapons or items yet after sinking a good amount of time in.-Dev work. Between April 11-15 2016, the Dev pushed out a new version every day. To see such dedication after release really-Dodging focused combat. Vanishing Realms combat is focused on parrying and blocking. Space Pirate Trainer has bullet time. Hover junkers has cover.You have none of these luxuries; you need to learn to dodge. At first this was frustrating as you need to move rapidly which means you can trip over your cord and/or run into a wall but onceyou get the hang of it there's nothing quite like having to dance around a boss.The bad:-Music. You'll hear the the same guitar rock solo over and over. I'd prefer it if the music was randomized (though I tend to listen tothisinstead-Enemies stand inside your hit-box. Often times an enemy will charge you and then stand inside you which makes it difficult to kill. It does train you to learn to dodge.-Difficulty. This game starts off way too hard. Less than 20% of the players who bought the game have beaten the first level (which is partially due to achievements being added recently).At this point I get decently far every time and the Dev has certainly made the first level easier over the last few patches. It was a rough start though.Vanishing Realms solved this problem by having a gem of regeneration at the very beginning (which made all the food items useless) as a way of choosing your difficulty and I think something similarwould increase the accessibility without ruining it for more serious gamers.-Always start with the staff. This is pretty normal in games where the starting equipment is always the same but I just wanna rock out as Gandalf in Hyrule listening to some 8bit.Final Verdict:This game has one of the highest time2money ratios of the games currently out (also recommend Audio Shield).While I wouldn't recommend it as your first VR game, I definitely recommend it as something that plays like a game instead of a tech demo"

While this is ok, I find myself often getting my foot tangled into the headset's cable when i am actually trying to move away from enemies quickly. Is there a way to turn with the sticks at all?All in all, this game is a nice, cute dungeon crawler. It has really great and spot on game mechanics. It reminds me a little bit of the dungeon crawling in the first Zelda from the NES days, but in a VR setting.If you're looking for a dungeon crawler within a VR experience then you probably would want to check this out. I'd recommend this game even though I haven't been able to turn with the stick on the touch controls. If this isn't implemented, hopefully it is one of these days.In the end, I decided to refund my purchase until the dev adds in some way to use the stick on the Oculus Touch to turn at least, even if there is a setting to warp turn at 90 degrees or 45 degrees at a time.

To make up for that, the exploration aspect is great and provides lots of hidden secrets and collectible items.But the absolute best part of the game is that it changes on every playthrough.

Reminscent of the Legend of Zelda, you hop from room to room, clearing them out. There's secrets, there's health / armor drops. There are spells you can get and different weapons.A few complaints:- inventory system is confusing. You get it wrong a bunch before you figure it out- swinging weapons are worthless. It's nigh impossible to not get hit so you have to use a throwable / castable weapon or you die- The shop mechanics are cool, but didn't end up feeling that important to the game. Some additional balance could be useful there- Boss fights are pretty mindless. Teleport to one corner, hit them a bunch, dodge their attack by teleporting to the other side...Other than those, it's a fun game, and I still recommend it! Great work!"

,Recommended,433600,33822268,Posted: 26 July,all,Baphomet,"Legend of Luca is a simple room-scale VR roguelike that plays like a classic Zelda game would from a first person perspective.  The majority of the game’s challenge is simply avoiding things by sliding, teleporting, or physically dodging out of the way, all the while returning fire. This ends up making it a bit of a bullet-hell experience. At the end of each level you will fight a boss and, upon winning, granted a new special weapon. There are various scrolls and tomes for temporary item and stat effects respectively that vary from useful to detrimental and are randomized with each playthrough as per the rogue style.If you’re looking for a title to introduce yourself or others to VR, Legend of Luca is a good pickup that will give you a fair return for your investment as it is procedurally generated to some degree, giving you a new experience with each playthrough. For experienced gamers though, the lethargic enemies and simple projectile patterns may be just a bit too easy and the game will become more of a chore than a means of entertainment."

Best soundtrack ever also"
,Not Recommended,433600,25014281,"Posted: 19 August, 2016",all,locky300,"If you are looking to play a VR equivalent to Binding of Isaac...look somewhere else. That game may or may not exist yet, but it certainly is not this game.The basic concept is similar, you are a non-descript hero who has been tasked by a goddess to travel through a dungeon to collect weapons of power in order to save the world. Throughout this dungeon you meet a range of villainous creatures who wish for you to die while exploring randomly generated rooms and collecting loot to grow stronger in the hope that you can defeat the final boss in the end.It has a lot of promise to it, but sadly fails in its execution. Let me start on the enemy design, while there are quite a few different creatures, many of them do not have any artistic link to each other and just feel out of place, awkwardly throwing you out of any immersion. These enemies will then be able to either throw fast moving projectiles at you, or slam their faces into your chest. Within the enemy range exists a couple charging enemies which can frustrate as they are capable of crossing an entire room within a second, give no warning of their attack, and deal damage by standing ontop of you.This brings me onto the combat which is very much lacking. I understand that vr is new, and what you should do with it is not always clear, but by having a melee system where you are unable to block and enemies can damage you simply by walking into you, you make melee weapons almost useless and uncomfortable to use. Ranged weapons are better but also have a few awkward kinks such as the bow forcing you to hold your controller in a different position to the wand. That sounds logical until you realise that you will be dual wielding weapons and as such will now have one hand trying to aim pointed forwards and one arm trying to aim while pointing upwards...this can lead to the system feeling clunky.The level generation has its own issues as enemies can spawn in regions you cannot enter and so have to have their location guessed as you awkwardly stand over an obstacle. Or you could have the ever so fun event where an enemy is randomly placed ontop of the entrance to a region so the instant you try to take in your surroundings you find your health draining away to an enemy that you cannot see as it is currently situated inside of your chest.It's difficulty scale has issues as well, you will rarely find yourself struggling for health or anything really until the 4th floor where enemies get a sudden boost in power and will annihilate you via  seemingly undodgeable attacks.Just a personal pet peeve here, I mentioned earlier that some of the enemies do not match each other's art styles...well that is an issue throughout the game, If you go through the screenshots you may notice this but many of the assets have wildly varying quality. Some have detailed textures (doors, enemies, weapons etc) while others have very blurry and vague textures. Some have very dark creepy looks while other things just look derpy and lighthearted as if they had been taken from a children's game. Then there is the skybox...I would advise removing the skybox and replacing it with a ceiling. When you have a very cartoony style game, it is not a good idea to set what seems to be a low resolution picture of some clouds as the skybox.Now I have ranted a bit on its negatives, but it does have some upsides. You always get one new weapon per floor which helps to add in some variety to the combat. The automatic minimap is very helpful for navigating the similar looking rooms. Outside of some janky parts the controls do work fairly well, teleporting rarely breaks, door movement is easy (you just cannot get too close to them or else that breaks), firing weapons outside of active abilities (Which I will not mention because outside of one throwable axe I could barely even tell what they did) feels mostly natural. Some people have mentioned that they dislike the soundtrack...but I have a soft spot for the sound of a guitar and as such the music was quite enjoyable for me, at least as background noise.In summary, this game does do what it says it will do. It offers a VR rogue light. Does it offer a good one? No, not really, I couldn't get over its flaws enough to actually enjoy myself. I am not one to forgive all of the flaws within a game just because it is VR. Maybe after an AI overhaul and a lot of changes to the melee combat system this could be a good game. But in its current state is is by no means worth how much it costs and I would not advise buying it unless it was on on 50% sale."

The game lives up to the permadeath genre. If you die you have to start over.2. Procedural dungeons (if that is what it is called) but not in the sense that the rooms will change their shape. They have different mobs in them each time or no mobs at all. They will have loot in them or no loot at all. They will have more or less obstacles in them or none at all.3. You have to play the game to actually get to the harder levels/Mobs. I didn't find it ""easy"" to kill all of the mobs that I encountered. Easy means yo unever get hurt. There were some cases where I have only on heart life left.4. There is no vender right now but at tis point you don't need one. Getting all the weapons is work enough. Maybe after the developer adds more levels or whatever he will add a vender. A vender would only make sense if there were MP or if it was an MMO of sorts.5. I encountered no bugs except teleporting outside of a wall before and that was really my fault getting too worked up fighting a boss. That is a minor thing to me.6. The bosses are not easy to fight at higher levels. I dare anyone to just stand there and see how many hits you take before death. I am sure the developer will add more models perhaps with different abilities.7. It is a dungeon crawler if that is what you call these games. Why are we not complaining about other games? A lot of people buy the pixel junk. Why is a dungeon crawler boring now....in VR? This is by far a better expereince than that junk and gives you a VR world to play in. That in itself is worth the modest price.Any VR Game imo is worth 10x its price. Can you make a game? Do you have an unlimited supply of cash on hand. Most of tehse VR devs are loners.8. Originality: Any VR game out now is original unless it bit off another VR game. I see nothing here doing that. To fill you in on the models and I don't know the story here: Developers can buy premade models to use and put them in their games. That is cost effective and sensible since there are obviously a lot of refund junkies out here and especcially on Steam. So you may see similar or the same models in games of teh same genre. Wow !! I can't beleieve developers want to save money to get us out a game to play. So expect more of that especially games using Unreal 4 engine.VR in the context we have now is new so give the developers a break. These are not meant to be AAA titles. This game is by far not junk or unworthy of playing. The music is not good for it ( the dev said he is trying to change that) so shut it off and play your own. I actually prefer not to play with any music.9. Roguelike game: This fits it pretty much. different dungeons every run, permadeath, etc. What more do you want form a new VR game with a very small team?Again I don't like permadeath games but I am actually enjoying this the more I play. Even if I get only 10 hours of gameplay it is worth the price to me. That at least is better than 1 hour trash play from a cheap game that offers no fun at all or repeats what another game is doing. Can anyone say arcade shooters?That is my humble but serious review. I personally don't think the negatives are warrented here. Especially if you like dungeon crawlers. I really don't know what people what these days. Especially in a new type of gaming (with today's tech). AAA titles will come but if we keep shafting these guys the VIVE will take a backseat. More people can't do room-scale than those who can. I am sure of that in my mind. You decide the future of us.Update: As of today The Legend of Luca is still recommended. The develeper has been actively updating the game and it is even better today than when first released. More loot, various monsters added, harder challenge as you move up levels, dangerous rooms, shop keeper is present to grab whatever is for sale, more chests and cool weapons. This game deserves some love from us VR users. More fun to me than the wave shooters and games we have out now. The room scale is used quite well. Buy it and Enjoy it for what it is.

This game is great but you can't use a controller to turn around.. Pathetic.. hate it. Honestly, whats the point having game controllers if you can't turn around? Great graphics otherwise and playable, but personally I can't stand it.. What a waste of time and Money.. Wish I had never brought the damn thing.Also, Teleporting is disorientating.. And where's the realisim in that? Am seriously diapointed and will think long and hard about buying any more games off steam."

76561197971021827,Recommended,433600,30689070,Posted: 23 March,all,VeryBadPenny,"I'm a long time gamer but buying almost exclusively VR titles now. At first I saw the screenshots for ALoL and saw a lot of assets (torches, skulls, goblins) familiar from Vanishing Realms. This isn't necessarily a bad thing (Vanishing Realms is great) but anyway this game is different enough for me to say I was wrong to make the comparison. This is an arcade game which I expect to go back to many times and it might even pull my kids away from Job Simulator.Almost everything about this game is satisfying and well done. It does not stretch my Vive system which is only a Xeon 3 GHz with GTX 970 (i.e. about the lowest spec you can use for VR). The game is difficult enough to be fun but not so difficult that you will give up. It has great music and I like the randomized rooms.When you start the game you choose full-size or scaled-to-fit where the scaled version shrinks each room to fit your space and it is like playing with models/toys, in the best possible way. I am impressed that the devs were willing to impliment this mode even though it potentially breaks some game mechanics (for example, you can now walk through walls and ""hide"" under the floor, just by crouching). The fact it, it's GREAT FUN and gives you two games for the price of one. Also the slide-forward motion mechanic in full-scale mode can be a bit much for some people so the scaled-down version is a safe no-sickness mode.So far my only specific criticism would be that the sword mechanic is vague - almost everything is a projectile weapon and then 1/10 of the time you have a sword which requires ""chopping"" and it feels out of place after all the dip/duck/dodge/circle-strafing. Also I keep finding scrolls marked ""unidentifed"", but I don't think the game told me what to do with them. That has me looking for a manual. Is there a manual? If there is I'd like to be access it in any steam game from the pause menu as well as a personal notepad. Anyway, like I was saying, great game, highly recommended and as with almost all these VR titles don't be put off by unremarkable 2D screenshots.Oh and I wish it were called something else - every time I read the name I get the song ""Luka"" stuck in my head. But at least it's the Lemonheads cover and not the Suzanne Vega version."

I'm enjoying the game. I have played two sessions so far. I got to level 3 in my first session and level 4 in my second session.There are two modes which you can choose from.1. Life-size scale - just like you are in a real dungeon. Monsters (so far) range from about 12 inches tall to 10 feet tall. You can teleport or use sliding locomotion to move around. The hitbox seems to be your head or your hands.2. Scaled down to room size - in my small playspace, that means that the weapons are about 6 inches long, and the monsters are small and cute. You physically move in the real world to move your character around. I'm not sure how it calculates the hitbox.I'm not sure which mode I prefer yet. You cannot save the game, and cannot carry over any items from one game to the next. Supposedly, there is a mod that allows that, but I haven't tried it yet.I do wish that there were some more in-game hints. I think you can only use the latest scroll that you picked up. Some scrolls seem to be used automatically (like a power-up), but I'm not sure. I had to do a search online to figure out what the dice were and how to use them. I still don't know how to use my character's special ability.If you look up, your character's stats float above you. I wish that there was a way to make the display appear a bit lower than it is.Maybe my weapons were really weak, but it seems to take a lot of hits just to kill the weak monsters. The boss monsters take a ton of hits. Maybe as I unlock more character classes, this will change.Pro-tip: You can shoot by just holding down the trigger buttons. You don't have to keep pressing them repeatedly."

Love where the combat is going, love the dungeon crawl navigation, love the direction the enemy and combat design are going, not too much a fan of the controlls as is, but again, Early access, look forward to seeing how everthing develops on all points. That being said, since this is an early access game, there are definitely a few things that could be tweaked for much better improvement. I do not want to give any feedback into art style, gameplay flow, etc since that is all a Game Studio's choice, but there are a few interface and procedure things I would advise the devs consider.Again, love the game and I am happy with what I bought, that being said...Some things that could use some work.In the ""standard navigation mode""1. When interacting with chests or simillar I keep on dropping my weapons I am holding. There is no use prompt for interacting with it, and if I my controller is pointed at a door, leaving the room instead of looting the chest takes priority. This is not as much a definable issue as it is annoying how moving between rooms is much more sensitive than opening a chest.2. When moving from room to room, the procedure currently goes,- Move to the ""start point"" of the next room, but in your current room.- Then Fade to black. (Either that or these two steps begin simultaneously, its just the fade to black does take a second to do whereas the move is instant).- Then the rest of the procedures to relocate to the next room3. I have been dropped directly into a room on top of enemies and it makes telporting difficult and health loss a bit brutal. It is fine if enemies are off to the sides of the door (because heck you are going through a dungeon), but right on top of the entry way is a bit difficult to manage, and a bit flowbreaking. From an immersion point of view, your character would not walk into a room and on top of enemies before fighting them.In ""Truescale Roomspace mode""4. Please disable the teleport prompt on the controller infographic.5. Please consider an option to disable the slide movement on the main menu. It would mean you have to navigate the room soley by moving around but it with all of the control options you ahve on the pad. accidentally offsetting your Playspace to Map is annoying.6. Sword combat from the true scale mode is a bit wonky, I am not sure how to register more than one hit and it is costing me more hits then I can dish out to figure out too well. Mind you I plan on playing more, but what critera constituted a hit was a bit confusing.I know it is quite a bit of nitpicking, and you guys are the Game Devs, but here is some feedback if you were interested in it.Advice/Feedback1a. Have some sort of use prompt for the chest or disable the door Use when you can use the chest1b. Make it so you have to point and hold on a door for like .5-1.5 seconds to use and go through one2a. Change the ""Move to another room"" Procedure so that you fade to black completely before relocating to next room.3a. Consider having some sort of either option to have the character ""Walk"" two steps into the next room as you fade in, or do not put enemies right within 2 feet of where the character starts.3b. Or when populating enemies in a room, shift around the mobs that would be ""Too close"" (You define that) to the player for a bit of a better start (this could also help with roomspace too given how you start in that.4. Since you cannot really TP when in true scale (at least I was not able to) can you move that as an visual prompt on the controler instructions during gameplay?5. Again during Truescale, If the player can manage without controller based movement, can you give them the option to disable the slide manuver as well?6. I know the combat is not perfect, nor was I expecting it to be, but could there be a dummy or invulnerable mob or something to practice against in the main menu area to get familiar with it?7. Instead of just hitting a direction on the controller pads could you consdier polling for a swipe to do actions? I know this does not sound too clear but hear me out. Also I understand this is not as much of a Tweak as it is, consider radically changing the interface.Since there is no tactile feedback as to what position you are at on the controller if you press down, then swipe in the direction youi want to do the action, then release, that would make more on the fly manuvers, and actions a bit more managable and less accidental (And that means you can also have a ""Tap"" action too."

I have almost all of the VR games available, and RPGs are the primary focus of my non-vr library.to properly review this game I want to break into into its parts.1.)VR2.)Gameplay------------------------------------==( PART 1 )==-As far as VR goes on a whole, here is what I think most people who do not own a VR headset need to know.VR is very simular to a magic trick...Your first few trips into VR are like the seeing a magic trick performed by someone. It blows your mind and you cant believe it.You want to see it again, hoping to learn how it works, what makes it special....after you learn how the trick is done, you can still apreciate the skill it takes to make it work, but the magic fades. In terms of VR it relates like this; as you get over the awe and wonder of being injected into a digital world, and you start to play the game you'll quickly find that VR is amazing but it is not a substitue for great game mechanics.-==( PART 2 )==-What Luca has going for it is the ""world of warcraft"" feeling assets, good music that fits the game (btw bryan, much better than the shred metal), great weapon design, and consistant performance and reliability(no crashes or fps dips) and an excellent GUI.what it lacks above all else is challange and a compelling reason to continue to play. Collecting weapons for the sake of collecting them is not bad concept, I did it in FFXI and WOW, and even DOOM(2016), but I did it because the difficulty ramped up and i had people to show them off to, and they were VERY hard to get, and very fun to use.I play a lot of VR but i always go back to a very simple game, Space Pirate Trainer, know why? as i get better and make it farther the game ramps up the difficulty, then displays how well i did compared to others. This motivates me to keep playingIn luca the enemies AI is nearly non-existant, you walk into a room and they all turn toward you and mosy in your direction as you easily pick them off. the way you ramp up the difficulty is not to add skill to the enmy but to just throw absurd numbers of them at the player.I want archers taking cover and sidleing and rolling around, trolls the bash through barriers and throw large boulders, and little goblins that flank you and use numbers because they're physically weak. swashbucking swordsmen that parry and strafe me.Mages performing magic to confuse me with barriers or smoke screens, or supporting the heavy hitters with buffs so i have a reason to take them out first.The simple square rooms can get old, I play a lot of D&D and i have seen entire dungeons laid out in this style that are not boring, the have occational puzzles, or venture into ""rooms"" that are shrubs as the walls and are outsiude with trees and pools of water, or lava under them where you can see it.This game has made many strides in the correct direction, but what it needs most is a compelling reason to keep playing (location variety, progressively more difficult monsters, REAL secrets, puzzles, etc... AI that is challanging!!)I am actually changing my recomendation from no to a yes, here is why: the author is trying to improve the game to meet the requests of the fans, and for that alone i would support him, the game is limited, but fun."
