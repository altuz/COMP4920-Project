You can't browse for music in-app (you have to use the VR web browser or desktop tab), and the visualizer is basically a few particle effects that seem to have almost nothing to do with the music. I know this is early access, but this is sparse even for an early access title."

Including touch and control triggered effects (maybe transitions triggered by head moment etc., possibilites are exciting)!!!!The beat detection has improved heaps since release and works great with my Spotify playlists. The effects wash around you and form in front of you in time with the music. There are waves and swirls and it is a sight to see.I'm buying a copy for my friend and i cant wait to see the next update!!!!PLEASE contact me if any testing or feedback is required.KEEP UP THE AMAZING EFFORTS 4REAL!!!!"
,Recommended,433630,23388076,"Posted: 4 June, 2016",all,FrozenFire,"This is the best VR experience I've had yet. I'm a very visual person, so I've always had a hard time getting a deep experience of music.  Laying down with ambient music like Maggie Rogers or John Frusciante dancing around me is one of the most relaxing experiences I've ever had.I truly look forward to how this evolves over time. There is lots of room for improvement, but this is a great start.If anyone feels too crowded by the effects, I'd recommend laying on the floor and at the edge of your play space. Having the center area a couple of feet ahead of you is much better than being inside of it."

,Recommended,433630,23564823,"Posted: 14 June, 2016",all,KuroSeijin,"If you're looking for a more VR focused music visualization than the milkdrop plugin in virtual desktop, this is it. It is by no means perfect but it has a tonne of potential. The updates seem pretty regular and the devs engage with the user base. As long as this app gets the TLC it needs(which seems to be the case so far) then it could become one of the killer VR apps one day. Just know what you're getting into before you purchase, it's ""Early Access"" for a reason.p.s. Don't forget to check out the beta."

These Devs are dedicated and actually listen to the community feedback, respond quickly, and most amazingly update often. How far this app has came from when it started have greatly surpassed my ideas and expectations.Alot of people are over reacting about the price and amount of content of the application, but I believe its worth every cent, yes its sparse for early access but they want our feedback starting from the ground level. Here is basic functionality of what we want to make...What direction would you like to see it go, what features would you like to see added. Great job Devs it takes a lot of hard work and dedication to do these kind of things. Lets make this an awesome VR experience."

Tried stuff with more beat and worked fine."
76561198191401023,Recommended,433630,31601724,Posted: 7 May,all,DrWhoFan,"VrAmp has always been the best music visualizer. I also like Dimensional Intersection but that's a different experince being fractal based. But now with the reworking of the floor and the addition of a full spectrum of colors being added to the particles, it's better than ever. It also has some simple tools for drawing which react to your music as well, giving a chance for some interaction and to be creative. I like to put on my own music then do a mix of viualizers and games that work with my personal library of music and it would not be as good without VrAmp. Buy it."
76561198092659634,Recommended,433630,24660555,"Posted: 1 August, 2016",all,Doomsday Clock,This is the ultimate chill VR experience. Listening to my own tunes and experiencing a visualizer lightshow from the inside. VR style. What's not to love? I would love to see more content eventually but this was definitely worth the money.
,Recommended,433630,24604593,"Posted: 29 July, 2016",all,Tonybyte,"I have a Rift CV1 and Touch isn't out yet but I still love this. I look forward to Touch and trying brushes. After a few songs, the particle effects seem the same and I hope for extreme variations in the future like Winamp effects. However, I grabbed this on sale and it's still early access so I'm confident this is only the beginning. :) Love it."

I would agree with the others that you should back off on the painting function and focus on new visual effects. Can't wait to see new stuff, but also really enjoying what you already have.CheersDavid"
76561198298177940,Recommended,433630,26604669,"Posted: 14 November, 2016",all,Vike,"This has a lot of potential. Just a few suggestions.1) When cycling effects it would great to have an option where I could actually choose which effect I wanted at specific parts of a song.2) A save option. Instant recall of effects I had previously recorded to a particular song.3) Maybe have categories for effects, for example..Fast, medium, and slow effects. So you know which effects to choose for breakdowns, or when the beat kicks in.4) Make use of the space better. Not just the dance floor I am in, but the whole room for some effects.Great job guys! Had a lot of fun with this. Looks AWESOME!"

There is no ""goal"" other than to just enjoy yourself in music.  Its a perfect app to escape reality for a bit but not feel like you are being attacked by zombies!"

,Not Recommended,433630,30326886,Posted: 4 March,all,balianthemighty,"It was great for the very brief time that it actually worked. Now, despite doing everything correctly, it just refuses to work. The visualizations either never trigger or, in a couple attempts, trigger for a second or two and then stop. I, unfortunately, will be refunding this. Will buy again in a heartbeat if the bugs get worked out."

,Not Recommended,433630,26113034,"Posted: 19 October, 2016",all,Mumra,"For a ""definite music visualizer and player for the HTC Vive"" this has extremely few visualizations or effects in general. The one main visualization doesn't even respond to the music very interestingly, as far as I can tell it is just the brightness pulsating with the beat and nothing else.For £10 I expect a hell of a lot more, even in early access. Yet another overpriced VR demo. This does very little that you can't already do with Tilt Brush's audio reactive mode."
,Not Recommended,433630,23354325,"Posted: 2 June, 2016",all,stangogh,Really cheap quality visualizations and definitely not worth the money.  You'd expect them to want to maximize the power of the graphics card but it seems this could run on any crappy pc.  Only reason to buy it is because it's the only thing out there of the kind right now but someone needs to make something better.

I feel like they take some of the immersion out of it with them being so ugly.  I think it would be more appropriate to have maybe some fancy tech like gloves or something.

,Recommended,433630,34990154,Posted: 16 September,all,joi76,"Had heaps of fun this first time I used this, jamming with Tiesto, Skrillex, David Guetta, Molly and more!By far the most fun visualizer I've tried and very immersive.I don't like the drawing funktion in it though with the controlers and would like if it was optional vs other kinds of effects like  changing them into flares or fadeout lines, even extended fireballs that you would move around with the sticks.Easily worth the $5"
