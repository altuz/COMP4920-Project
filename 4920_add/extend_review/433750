,Recommended,433750,22783042,"Posted: 3 May, 2016",all,Pity Pit,"The Grandfather is a short puzzle game that will most likely last you 30-45 minutes.First of all, the narrators voice is way to low, she is almost barely audible the first time you hear her. I suggest getting this fixed. Let it be known that this was the only issue in the game, I did not encounter any other bugs or issues so it's definetly a stable and well made game.The Grandfather is a wonderfully illustrated horror game that tells you about a sad miserable grandfather who has never been loved by anyone, including his wife who enjoys torturing him emotionally by giving him the scariest version of the stink eye ever.One night after going to sleep in his bed, separated from his wife's (wow that woman is a total ♥♥♥♥♥), he wakes up, none of his body parts present OR attatched to his body! Only his head, which also can float, he begins his venture to find his body parts, what he ends up with though, is better than what a paint brush could ever do.The puzzles in The Grandfather were, honestly, not very difficult. Maybe I got stuck two times trough the whole game, the puzzles felt sort of meaningless as I just clicked at things, but they were fun to figure out when figuring out was needed.The game was made in Unity 5 (which I highly suggest to any devs who are starting out, for real, get it, it's free) which most people enjoy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at, however thanks to games like Firewatch, The Forest and the development hell beaut' Raindrop it's slowly getting a better reputation after it got slaughtered by the billions of Slender clones.The Grandfather though, it's weird, it has this ugly yet pretty, cool looking style that gets accompanied by some nicely done lighting. It also has these short segments that are first person where you walk forward, these are also very nice. The illustrations of The Grandfather are done by the talented SaintYak, the art is very well done and characters have a nice artstyle going on, objects in puzzles look sort of sketch'y like if they were drawn quickly, really adds to the creepy atmosphere of the game.There isn't really any music in The Grandfather, if there is then it's some sort of saw being played on, it's very weird and sounds kind of creepy... Or funny. Other than that there is omnious ambient noise going off most of the time, which works and fits the rooms you solve puzzles in. Whatever is there of soundwork is interesting and adds to The Grandfather's already creepy atmosphere.All in all, I pretty much enjoyed The Grandfather, it was way cheaper than I expected it to be and it totally came out of nowhere as I forgot it's release date, I hope it does well and that more people will try out this little enjoyable, creepy game.I give The Grandfather a 8/10"

But over all, the game was not very good. The transitions where odd, and the puzzles more frustrating than intriguing. The story was nice, though I thought the game could have been more."

It has a really nice art style, but as others have mentioned, the narration is very quiet. The puzzles are fun, but they don't seem to progress. I would have liked to see more overall in this game in terms of story development and difficulty."

,Recommended,433750,24060906,"Posted: 3 July, 2016",all,Captain Vixey,Its a different and unique game that takes some serious thought for an idiot like me to fully comprehend.It obviously took a lot of effort to create a game with such an intriguing concept as this with such an interesting art style that I don't see very often.The Puzzles are relatively simple if you have experience with puzzle games but for those who don't have that it experience it is much more of a challenge.It may be annoying to proceed in some aspects of the game but overall it is an interesting game that I would recommend to anyone that is interested in purchasing the game or anything remotely similar to it.

It was incredibly short, and the content was dubious (which I will get to in a moment.) enough to give me pause. However at just under a dollar, the fact that it has a beginning, middle and end with gameplay in between makes it at least worth the price of admission.I appreciate what the developer of this game was trying to do, and I appreciate oblique, surreal or mysterious storytelling. A peice of work just needs to have a solid sense of itself, and steady direction to not have it be an unrelatable mess. This game does not have a solid sense of itself. It wears it's Lynchian influences embarrassingly on it's sleeve without realizing that what makes his movies so good is that the symbolism, while impenetrable, is consistent and resonant. It never got around to developing it's own set of symbols for the player to relate to (The umbilical cord was a literal umbilical cord, for goodness sake.). The story is a straight line from start to finish, with no conflict to speak of. Even the antagonist is revealed to be such through a series of flashbacks which do not relate to the surreal gameplay, which one can assume is the ""present"" in the narrative timeline.The gameplay is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ puzzles. They're meant to be non-logical puzzles, I realize, but that makes them ♥♥♥♥♥♥ puzzles.That's all the smack I'll talk about this game. Those are my personal opinions on the game's story, but I'd still say it's worth the dollar I paid for it. I think new and weird things should be supported, even if they suck, because hopefully they get better through that support."
,Not Recommended,433750,29844252,Posted: 11 February,all,[hlife] Hotdog,"A story with interactive elements, but there isn't much game to be had here. The point-and-click sections are rather abstract and don't make a lot of sense. There's another part where you just walk forward down a bland tunnel and the rest is story told by a bored-sounding narrator.All this in less than 20 minutes. It's a bizzare adventure, but one that was confusing and short-lived."
,Not Recommended,433750,29402212,Posted: 21 January,all,Aria Theo,"While the art for this game is fantastic and appropriately moody, the rest of the game leaves something to be desired. It can be completed in only 20-40 minutes, the quiet narration comes across as lifeless, and the gameplay is at times tedious and repetitive. Perhaps this would have worked out better as a short story rather than a game."

I loved that, i really loved that.But then the game itself... i dont know... you have to do some things in different rooms. Sometimes things are totalli random and you dont even know what to do. Once i went on clicking randomly till something happened, then I just got stuck because I didnt really know what to do. Things were too random.  And I am disappointed because i really wanted to know how the story would have ended.The story itself was really really crepy and absolutely weird but... I wanted to know... sadly probably i will never."

,Recommended,433750,29126010,Posted: 8 January,all,TheJoker116,"Not really a game but more of a narrative, interactive story whose mains selling point is the art and overall creepiness. I'm not sure what I was expecting when I bought this but the creepy art was enough to make me curious about it. It's a very short experience, you'll be spending 20 minutes at most, probably less, since the game's main gameplay element is a series of simple puzzles which you simply need to click on various thing to figure out. There is no context and no explanation to help you with these puzzles, but they're easy enough to figure out, it's pretty much impossible to put a puzzle in an unwinnable state.The story is rather creepy, which is really the game's best quality. The art, the mood, the plot, all this has been put together in a bag of gore and darkness to make the player slightly uneasy with eerie sounds and dark, dirty-looking rooms inside a big, creepy house where a sad man suffers from his cold wife's constant torments. The plot, well, it's nothing much, it's a very short story, the Grandfather's sadness is explained as you progress through the puzzles, there's not much development but it's surreal and dark.Of course, with an artsy 2$ game there is bound to be some flaws, for one, its length. This is a 20-minute experience at most, the puzzles are pretty easy to figure out and don't require much thinking, only some clicking and dragging random objects until the screen goes dark and the narration continues. The narration, not bad in itself, is unfortunately muffled and hard to hear and there are no subtitles, you'll have to really pay attention to understand what is going on. The gameplay is very simple but before each puzzle there is a boring, unnecessary walking segment that only serves to pad the game between puzzles and narrative sequences. The Grandfather also have zero replay value, unless you want to show it to a friend, there's absolutely no change in the story, it's the same experience over and over again.Now, would I recommend The Grandfather? This is a time I wish there was a ""Maybe"" option on Steam, because I don't fully recommend it but I also don't think it should be completely be dismissed as a low-budget, low-ambition indie game with next to no appeal. The art is good, the narrative is interestingly creepy and it's a pretty casual puzzle game which doesn't require much effort to play through but it's also short and has low replayability. On the plus side, it's cheap and really, if you have two bucks just hanging in your wallet, then give this a try. Just without too much expectations."
,Recommended,433750,32049171,Posted: 29 May,all,Giu,"I understand the mixed reviews on this particular game but I must pass it on with a positive review. Yes, the gameplay can be frustrating and confusing without instruction but once you finish the first puzzle it is easy to understand how the rest works. My positive endorsement however is due to the amazing cinematography and story of the game. If you view this as more of a film or story than a puzzle game it becomes a fascinating story illustrated in a unique form and art style. I recommend this to anyone who wishes to spend about a half hour watching this comic come to life."
76561198058248655,Not Recommended,433750,34824582,Posted: 8 September,all,singingbarista,"I bought this game because of The Music Machine and Moon Sliver, which had sparse narration but still managed to pull off complex characters and a chilling, interesting world that outshone the lower-end graphics.The Grandfather is the opposite, a beautiful game with gorgeous, gross illustration, but the story and characters are shallow, and the game portions do not support or develop the story. Grandfather is sad because his wife is mean. Feel sad because you are told to. Plug up the toilet and flood the room with blood because... we're sad? Yes, I can see the symbolism that is attempted, but there's no player buy-in. It feels like a missed opportunity for so much more.With that said, this game isn't expensive, so play for yourself if you're unsure."
,Recommended,433750,35273897,Posted: 28 September,all,guantou,"I enjoy simple games like this that are more art than game. So for me it's worth it. However, due to its incredibly short length (about 30minutes to finish) it's only worth it because the asking price is also very low.  If you get it on sale, bonus.Often cheap games like this are all bugged up but I didn't experience any bugs at all. It worked fine, so there's that.If $1 is a lot of money to you, don't buy it. If $1 is no big deal to you, it's worth having a nice little half hour experience."
