,Not Recommended,433850,30763751,Posted: 26 March,all,Bob Lee Swagger,"After almost spending my entire life (almost 1000 hours, including the original H1Z1) here is my final review for you guys.It all began 2015, where the glorious H1Z1 has been released. At this time the game was full of bugs, well I didn't judge in those days, because it was an Early-Access-Version of the game.Though it had a lot of bugs, it was really fun to play, with friends of course.At this time you actually were getting rewards for winning, even if you were playing in a group. Nowadays you will not get rewarded after winning when playing with a group. So for some people (including me), the motivation to win was missing, since those days.After the Developer Studio switched and reorganized from Sony Online Entertainment to Daybreak Games (TheyBreak Games     ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ) the game was on their way to fall down.You couldn't see any progress in developing, major bugs existed for months, the priority list of Daybreak Games was disastrous. Well though I had those bad impressions, I wasn't missing the fun at this time.In 2016 they made the decision split the game into two. H1Z1: Just Survive and H1Z1: King of the Kill. I had hope in the developement of this game again, because I thought maybe it will help them to organize themselfs better and to set priorities.On one side I was happy that they brought some new stuff, new gamemodes to play, events, etc., like Ignition, Skirmish, Green Dawn, Hardcore, but on the other side major bugs still existed. But for me, it was still fun to play.Later 2016 they have made their biggest mistake. They (re)-""launched"" their game (fun-fact: its still in early-access) and promised a major change in gameplay, graphics, performance and developing. So let's see what the ""launch"" brought us:(1) They have removed the old map and replaced it with the new Z2-Map. You might ask yourself now, what, is so bad about the new Z2-Map?:- Though they promised graphic enhancements, they've just increased the color saturation, to pretend, that graphics are better now. But as you might guess: They are not even close to better. The lightnings in the buildings are worse then ever. You can hardly see the loot inside of the buildings.- The actual reason for why the map was changed was that the devs thought, that the original map was maybe a bit too much copy and pasted. Here is my opionion on that: The new map is even more copy and pasted. Almost every buildings looks the same.- There are no real memorial places or fighting spots, like they were on the original map. Maybe it is because that I am a little bit nostalgic, but people who have played the original H1Z1 will understand me, when I rave about PV Police-Station, Radio-Tower, Opfer Camp, Reservoir Dam, B2, Hospital, etc, etc...- Loot is clipping inside of the textures so you cannot pick it up. This bug exists since almost half a year now.- Floating trees and ugly streets and textures are daily fare.- They won't give us the opportunity to play the old map, since they ""deleted it by mistake"" so they said. (Another fun-fact: the old map is still available in H1Z1: JS, so there is no way that it had been deleted)- There is no pit in the new Box of Destiny. Where the hell shall summit go then?(2) They have made a major change to the Interface and the HUD, which in my eyes clearly looks fancier but is actually worse than the original, because it seems really unclearly to me.(3) The translations are actually worse than google translator.(4) They have removed previous exlusive gamemodes, so you can't play them anymore. Well there is the ability to do so, but there never had been an event where you can play them.(5) They brought in a new rewards system and removed the old one. Unfortunatley, I never could experience those, because as you might noticed, I was always playing with friends. But nope, there are still no rewards for groups.(6) The performance is still as bad as in the old H1Z1.You might ask yourself now, why did they make those changes and why did they relaunch the game?Clear answer boys: to market the game more efficient.I have lost faith in this game and thats why I felt the need to write this review.I have the bad feeling that this game won't get any better, since the problem-solving approaches from the developers are slow, less efficient and mostly alternative and do not treat the cause of most problems."

,Not Recommended,433850,29015371,Posted: 4 January,all,Jmclma,"Before telling you why the game is a no go, I have to say that I enjoy playing it with my friends its a lot a fun, we have a lot of PVP action and funny moments, but this game is glitchy as ♥♥♥♥. I will be naming the pros and cons just so you can make a decision for yourself.(*In my opinion* If you don't have any friends to play with don't buy it...)PROS:-The PVP is quite good and comparing to other BR games, its the best out there,-If you have friends it can be an emerging experience and a lot of fun.-The gun mechanics are somewhat cool.-The variety of items in the game, even though there are barely some, have some use and you will most likely like them.-Car mechanics are somewhat decent.-A lot of places to loot.CONS: (Im starting from the glitches that happen from the loading screen untill we are on the arena)-When entering the game if you have a bad connection so many glitches will happen, like not having a parachute, landing under the map, landing and then 2 seconds into the game dying to the environment, etc...-Sometimes while trying to enter a car you will receive a message saying ''Something is in the way'' and you won't be able to enter.-Jumping from a 2 feet rock will make you lose HP.-Some players either are hacking or have an amazing aim, you will see this since they hit you from over 100 meters, every single shot and this is annoying because if you stop to shoot at them you miss every shot when on the other hand they hit every single one.-When you shoot at someone, and you are sure you tagged him, after he kills you, sometimes you will see his HP at 0 but he will still be running and jumping.-Entered a jip, waited for my friend he entered aswell, turned on the engine pressed W to go foward and died to ''Disconnect''.-The bombs dropped from the plane are bad since the day I bought this game which was over a year now, if they drop on top you you probably won't die unless you have like 10 HP.-There is a rank system which im not even sure if you play against your own rank. (I was on the worst one Silver V and saw guys that would hit someone 100 meters away and 2 tap them).-There is a level system which every 5 levels you get an unlocked case and you can open them to get some clothes, we should get cases every level because on the higher ones it becomes a grind to level up.-When you finish in the top 10 you get nothing, you only win something if you bet on yourself free coins which after finishing in top 15 (I think) gets you skulls to unlock the limited clothes they have on the skull shop, and it only has like 10 cosmetics.***SIDE NOTE***The developers of this game are the worst, they only care about your money. After buying the game from SONY they decided to split the game (H1Z1: Just Survive and H1Z1: King of the Kill) this was the most stupid business stunt I have ever seen in my life (Since now Just Survive has pretty much no interest to them). They did this to have a team working on Just Survive and another team working on KOTK, LOL, since Just Survive is getting little to no updates I don't think they are putting much effort into it. KOTK is pretty much a carnival party at this point, all you see is players dressed up in a huge amount of colors that make them look like ♥♥♥♥ing clowns. The KOTK game became a pay-2-dress and everytime they update the game we only see cases, little tweaks to guns and no major/game breaking glitches getting fixed. You pay 20$ (or 10$ on sale) to play a game that its main focus is who looks the prettiest. Or pay 20$ (or 10$ on sale) for Just Survive to play a game that has basically no updates and the dev team doesn't really care about. In my opinion you shouldn't buy the game but after what you read you make your own decision."
,Recommended,433850,29591398,Posted: 30 January,all,Asiilex,"The honest and legit way on how to ALMOST win a game in H1Z1. (AFTER UPDATE)!1. Begin by launching up the game. You will probably be forced to restart the launcher a couple of times, but it has always been like that so don't worry.2. After 35 restarts, press the SOLO button and wait 25 minutes to get into your game.3. When finally inside the pre-game arena, make sure to scream as loud as you can and insult other players as much as possible. Perhaps let them know what size your weiner is?4. You will then be entering the game. Unfortunately you will be stuck on the loading screen, so restart the game again. But once again, it's normal. Don't freak out.5. When you finally get into the game after another hour of start up time, you will spawn without a parachute and fall to the ground. Happily you spawned next to a little camp and you found all the best loot. (No backpack, no helmet, T-shirts, golves and that ugly little pistol with the red ammo that no one uses.)6. With your loot you will hide by the trees and act like you ARE the tree, until a little noob with an AR, 5 laminated armours and a sniper rifle, casually walk past you.7. 2-tap him with your pistol and spam C to T-bag him.8. With your new loot, kill 30 people and record it to later on let everybody on youtube know that your are better than StormenTV.9. You are now starting to get sweaty and nervous because of the final 1v1 situation. Just as you are going to shoot your enemy with your sniper, you get a warning sign saying that your weapons will be locked due to bad internet connection.10. Freak out, run out to your router and make sure that it's running fine.11. After finding out that nothing was wrong with your internet, run back to your computer and take a look at your screen.12. ** 2nd Place. 30 kills. **13. Get T-Bagged by the player who killed you while he brags about how good he is and how he had sexual intercourse with your granny last night.14. It should now be midnight, go to sleep.

SORRY IF YOU DON'T AGREE.ALSO PUBG HAS FIXED ALOT OF THINGS I'VE STATED.REVIEW WAS POSTED JUNE 21st.If you're stuck between PUBG and KOTK let me just break it down for you.KOTK PROS -•	Fast paced•	Better audio all the way around (in my case at least)•	Will run much better on most low end computers, don’t try to buy PUBG if you don’t have at least a decent computer•	Nice art style•	Consistent updates•	Simple•	Very entertaining with friends•	Spawns are completely random•	Good time-to-kill ratio with headshots (as in feels correct when shooting, I feel like I'm doing damage)•	Car mechanics work fluidly in this game•	Great skins•	Ranking system is greatKOTK CONS –•	Hit or miss when it comes to hit registering (better hope you’re lucky)•	Shotgun is kind of broken and in an awkward slightly OP stage•	A few very minor bugs•	A 1 in every 500 chance you run into a hacker of some sorts, most are killable but some are top notch•	Game ends in a few set areas so it gets old after a while but a new update will fix that•	Not many different variants of guns (new one coming soon)Overall I love KOTK and I personally prefer it, but I’ll still put it to you straight on PUBG.PUBG PROS - VERY CONSISTENT UPDATES•	Very realistic looking graphics and weapons•	Weapons can have attachments•	Huge map•	Hiding is pretty good (especially in wheat fields) which may be a con for you•	Map helps you find your way easily (very noob friendly)•	Ability to choose where you land to a degree•	Many different map settings•	Weather occurs•	Character movement is absolutely dope in my opinion•	There’s boats•	More weaponsPUBG CONS –•	Misleading weapon mechanics and time to kill•	Cars are clunky and all around just do not work well•	The ability to choose spawns makes players spawn in a very linear line which isn’t my favorite honestly (and no you cant reach almost any point when you drop out, you can go pretty far though)•       100 (from what I've had in games at least) people spawn compared to 174 in H1Z1 which just makes H1Z1 more actioned packed•	Sounds are terrible, and I mean terrible, if you’re like me and rely on sound a lot in games this game will upset you highly as in you can't normally tell where shots are coming from if you hear them (I have Razer Kracken Chroma's 7.1 in perfect working order and audio settings are perfect, that being said gunshots and things of that nature are very hard to pinpoint which i don't like)•	Kick and bullet drop on weapons seems to be not as polished in my opinion then KOTK•	You have nothing to really play for, there are ranks (stats wise) but H1Z1 has a way of making you feel more rewarded with placements (yes you get points at a end of a game in PUBG so you can get your 6 cent skin)On the bright side of things, I do believe PUBG has a way higher ceiling then KOTK so it could easily prove me wrong.So there you have it. I was trying my best to not be biased but overall KOTK is my game. Don’t get me wrong, they are both good games and have their own futures. Should be great to watch them grow. Hope this helped.

,Not Recommended,433850,32860816,Posted: 27 June,all,Rabbit シ,"I had +220 hours on H1Z1 before it was split.I will tell you what: The concept of BR was good. It was quick, full of people, very competitive, always gave you that rush. It was good for alpha, but then you started to notice something.- The map sucks. Its like if you had spent 2 hours on far cry 2 editor. No details at all. Same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ vegetation brush everywhere.- 3 main weapons: shotgun, ar15 and ak47. So poor.- Queues to play. Such long queues. Was it that expensive to buy more servers? Oh wait...thats what the next point kicks right in.- Developers only care about money. For real. Updates only had small fixes like ""ak now is a bit less powerful"" or ""car speed reduced"" and all the rest was about 100 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ skins for which you have to buy keys and crates. Its such a rip off. Its an alpha game, for ♥♥♥♥s sake, and they charge you like millions for skins. Winning battle royale only gives you horrible loot which is absolutely worthless, because, of course, they do not want you to get cool content by winning and proving yourself to be good, no, they want you to spend more moneyz in their alpha game which will never be completed except for the fantastic crate&key system. They even have their in-game money. Why? So they can control the price of keys. It would be fatal for them if people could sell keys or crates.Its so disgusting to see that as soon as they get some fame, they instantly forget about the game and start looking for all kinds of ideas to rip you off. It bothered me so hard that my ingame name in DayZ SA is ""H1Z1Sucks"".Seriously, only buy this game if all you care is about BUYING content that otherwise you would get for free. In addition (but last) their ♥♥♥♥in brilliant bussinessmen came up with the idea of splitting the game in two, so that instead of having one alpha game with two game modes, they had 2 broken alpha games for each 20€. And the worst is, they tried to make us believe it was because ""they wanted to focus more"".Oh, and as I write I remember another thing, the ""Green Battle royal"" or whatever it was called. They realised people only played for the BR mode, so they thought ""Hey, could we charge them for playing BR mode? Oh yea we can, but lets disguise it as a new mode with extra luxury weapon skins"". Then you win the br green and you check your AR15 skin and realise they only put 30 seconds in sprayin some green ♥♥♥♥♥♥ brush over the model. ♥♥♥♥in brilliant."

Do not support unethical price gouging.The developer has a long history of releasing buggy, unoptimized, and overall terrible games ripe with microtransactions, and this one is no different.  They LIED about it going free to play, and then split their game in half, doubling the total price before it's even out of Alpha. This is not okay!This change is nothing but a dirty cash grab.  Daybreak as a company has a track record of failure and will doanythingto try to get out of the red, and this is a prime example.They haven't released a quality game in over 15 years.  With all due respect to their employees and their livelihoods, this company should have been abolished years ago.  It has been driven into the ground repeatedly by poor management, and compounded by lousy investments from both Sony and Columbus Nova.No one talks about it, but there is no guarantee this game will even be available to play in months, let alone years. In 2014 Daybreak (then SOE) reportedly lost Sony $60 million, and now just one year after being sold off, this is the kind of gouging they're trying to pull on customers.  Not enough red flags for you? They've had multiple huge layoffs over the years,at times completely devestating their customer support and quality assurance teams.If your battle royale itch needs scratching, I'd recommendRustorARK. Both games have survival and BR modes, both are backed by more committed developers that aren't just there to separate your money from your wallet."

I prefer Pubg. But, when I played I feel that H1Z1 did not have simple features such as specator mode. This game has been in development for how long and didnt have specator? When Pubg was released they started rolling out patches supporting these SIMPLE features.

If you play solo and go at it as a lone wolf you will have a fun time and can bet on your performance to get dope prizes. The issue is when you want to play with your friends and enjoy the teamwork aspect of the game there is no incentive for performance. So even if you spend 30+ minutes and end up winning the game you recieve nothing not a crate or anything. How do you expect someone to keep playing a game with nothing to show for it?

,Not Recommended,433850,21319098,"Posted: 19 February, 2016",all,Swift,"Having played a lot of Battle Royal in H1Z1 (before they split the game), I can say this game mode is pretty fun. But, it is just ONE game mode. So, ask yourself if it is worth buying a 20€ game for just ONE gamemode, a gamemode previously part of another game!?-----Daybreak claims that they will be adding more gamemodes, but that's yet to be seen. We don't know what gamemodes or how many will be added. Reading the early acces page they claim to add additional gamemodes and game rules. Judging the history of this game/development, I would not be supprised if they only add slight variations of the ONE gamemode Battle Royal.Before the split, there already where 3 variants of this game mode, you had one without zombies, one with zombies and one with special rewards for winning! This last mode was behind a cash wall and you need to buy tickets for real hard cash to join this mode.Technicly they could say they have 3 gamemodes. Then you have the same game with team of 2, or team of 5 players. So there you have it, 5 gamemodes! :PWe have to wait and see what the new gamemodes are, if any are added!Ask yourself, knowing this, is ONE gamemode still worth 20€?-----Let's inform you some more, because this game has a rocky history with many claims that never became reality!They ones claimed to NEVER add pay2win mechanics to this game, then airdrops where added to survival mode that gave you food, water, weapons and ammo! Airdrops are behind a paywall from real hard cash! Though they changed the way this works but still ...They claimed this game would become free2play ones released. Guess what, it's 20€ with additional supply crates and cosmatic microtransactions! Even payed gamemodes like the Battle Royal variant (Green Dawn) and airdrops for ingame loot.Again, ask yourself, is this game worth 20€, with possible new gamemodes behind cash wall, with micro transactions and many broken promises?Then the worst part, the recent split of H1Z1 into two games.This game, King of the Kill, was part of the original H1Z1. You had survival servers and Battle Royal servers! Now you have the survival game, 20€ and the battle royal game for another 20€! And what would happen if say a new gamemode is added to King of the Kill, which becomes very popular, will they split agian? Who knows!?This split would not be the worst of things, if they cut the price in half. Would be fair since they cut the game in half but nope, now you pay 2x20€ for something that ones was 1x20€, for something that ones was promised to be free2play!Also, remember you now need to pay double for microtransactions. Getting a new piece of clothing from a microtransaction was universal availible for all servers and gamemodes. Now, if you want that same piece of clothing be prepared to buy the same item twice!!!Knowing all of this, ask yourself is ONE gamemode worth 20€?-----With this out of the way you might want to know if this ONE gamemode is fun and yes, I said I have lots of fun with this gamemode. So let's get into that!You spawn with around 150 other players on a large open map. Everyone drops down from the sky with a parasute. It's now time to land as fast as you can, so you can be the first to loot weapons, ammo, backpacks and more. So you can be the first to blast others in the face.After a few minutes a savezone is drawn on your map, because toxic fog will be released and slowly drive you towards the savezone. This mechanic is fun and usefull to drive the remaining players towards the same spot.Though there is only ONE map it's big enough to be fun for a long time. Mainly because a lot of things are random. Not the map itself but your spawn location is random, weapon spawns are random and the savezones are random. One match ends in an urban location and another on top of the mountains.All seems good, but there is also a lot wrong with the game and it's mechanics!Spawning for example! You don't spawn at the same time as your enemies. It depends on your loading time, internet connection and random bad luck (sometimes the game takes 2 or 3 times longer to load). This means people with faster hardware and internet connection land faster, getting guns fasters and thus have an increased change to win!Next problem is that hitbox detection and netcode are so random. With a bit of bad luck you can shoot somebody in the head for multiple times without them dieing. While other times you one hit kill them.Same with the shotgun, it's spread pattern is random. So you can almost get sniped from long distance with a shotgun while other times you can't hit/kill somebody at close range! And it's all luck, or badluck depending how it ends!On top of that there aren't many weapons and in the end it comes down to AR15 for long range, shotgun for close range. Perhaps the AK47 (though it got nerved) or if you are lucky the hunting rifle (sniper that only drops from airdrops). All the other weapons are just useless compared to the above, so bows, crossbows and pistols are ignored! You only use them if they are the first weapon you can find early game.-----Eventhough this gamemode is a lot of fun, even with all it's flaws, I can't recommend it to anyone! Specially knowing that this ONE gamemode was part of another game!Perhaps if they fix the core issues (spawning, hitbox detection, etc) and add more gamemodes AND lower the price to 10€ or less, then and only then it might become worth it!For now, it's a big NO NO. Not recommended!"

,Not Recommended,433850,33485134,Posted: 12 July,all,-=IKB=-,"H1Z1, in short, is a game where at the beginning all the players are dropped from the sky on parachutes, as they land, they try to collect all kinds of items that may help them survive the game. To help the players find each other, the playground area shrinks every now and then by releasing a toxic gas. The game ends when all the players are dead except the last survivor.The game is very casual, for example weapons have a goofy recoil, for instance, an AR jumps left and right as you shoot it. You can jump off a car at its full speed and you will be fine. You can use a key from one car for every car. Some people like it, but personally, I'm not a fan of it.The game has some significant pros like a good optimisation and as it's casual, it's also easy to understand for new players. Ranking system which works quite well and the ability to play with friends on duos and fives.First and probably the biggest flaw of the game is that it's in early access for over 2 years now. During this time the game hasn't changed that much aside from some bug fixes, adding skins and UI improvements. I think that the developers have had enough time to release the game, but it seems like the biggest things that they have done are adding a bunch of skins and splitting the game into H1Z1 JS and H1Z1 KOTK so that now instead of one game for 20 euros, there are two for 20 each.Another thing is a lack of weapons. The game has only one kind of shotgun, two assault rifles AK and AR, bow, crossbow, some pistols and one sniper rifle which is only available in supply drops. I think that the devs should add at least one more shotgun and assault rifle instead of plenty of skins to them.I'd also want to see some more maps, as there is only one.H1Z1 is not a bad game. I didn't really know if I should mark the review as positive or not. I'd mark it as a neutral one if I could, but because I can't, I'm forced to mark it as a negative review. So overall, if you like the casual mechanics of the game, don't mind the lack of variety in weapons and only one map. Then the game might be for you. Otherwise, I'd rather spend money on PUBG."

The North America server is way less hackers but I can't connect. It's to easy to hack. Playing in 5s some teams have all hackers. You can even que with a hacker wow. Report system don't work.

Another time I was standing in a kitchen tearing up clothes to make bandages, and I died.

,Recommended,433850,28194756,"Posted: 4 December, 2016",all,Cloud | HURRY UP D2!,"I could write about all of the bugs and problems with this game, but that's something most of you have heard proably over 10 times. Instead I'm going to write why I, with over 200 hours played, love this game even though I know and experience all of the recurring problems with near every match.H1Z1 isn't perfect, but it's still, imo, the best battle royal game on the market. It is truly one of the easiest to play and enjoy, it is fun with friends and has a strong competitive side to the solos of it, as well as scrimmages hosted by third party h1 streamers or fans. This game is playable in many different ways, you don't have to be amazing at this game to win or progress far into a match, you can play with varying differnet playstyles, whether it be agressive or relaxed.All in all 9/10My only major complaints/problems with the game are:-The lack of ping lock, allowing other region players (Asia mostly) to play on NA servers and pretty much flying around on your screen making it very hard to kill-The lack of banning for people who team up in solo matches-The fact that the November update still hasn't come out... and it's December.*Post-December Update Edit*So, the game was FINALLY updated... we got a new season (or preseason), we got some new skins, they sorta kinda fixed the shotgun and they fixed one of the major exploits... was this patch good? No. Was it bad? No.Daybreak has some major issues at their headquarters, they are either understaffed or just dont give a ♥♥♥♥ when it comes to this game sometimes. To their credit they did address one of the major problems, the shotgun and now its about 95% consistent, which is much better than the 50/50 you'd get pre-patch. However, there are still many exploits and bugs they haven't addressed. Daybreak I know you care about your fanbase and want to see this game do well, so for the love of god address some of these issues please!- Ban. Teamers. In. Solos. Add a different reporting technique for reporting teamers rather than Ctrl+R, perhaps do Ctrl+""any other letter"" if you see this player is teaming in solos... It's the most frustrating thing ever to be killed by teamers in solos, believe me.- The snaking/prone glitch was addressed in the most recent patch, yet people are still doing it... fix it. Don't allow for people to get into a car while prone, simple. There's no reason that you would legitimately ever need to get into a car while prone if you WEREN'T trying to preform some type of exploit.- Reduce the solos que time in lobbies. The wait time, once you spawned into the Fort Destiny Box used to be like 90 seconds, now it is around 150 seconds, I know we're talking about the difference of a minute but it's noticable and quite annoying, at least lower it to 120 and meet in the middle.**Post PlayerUnknown's BG/Pre April Update**So PUBG came out, if you didn't know PUBG is Player Unknown's Battlegrounds. Another game in the continuously growing battle royale genre, and many people beleive this game will be the ""h1 killer"" and what ""H1 should have been"" and while I enjoy the game and have near 20 hours into it already, I can confidently say... this game will NOT kill H1Z1.Here's the thing about PUBG.. its ♥♥♥♥ing slow, like holy♥♥♥♥♥♥is it slow. While, as I said above, it is a GOOD game, it is not an H1 killer, and honestly you shouldn't compare the two. They are two seperate games, h1 and PUBG, where H1 is more arcade-like, with much faster pace, with a much more entertaining premise of fast paced fighting and run-and-gun type gameplay and on the OTHER side of the spectrum PUBG is what people who don't like H1's fast pace prefer.. because its sooooooooo slow. Not to say that PUBG isn't fun, because again IT IS, it's just not H1. They're two seperate games and should be enjoyed seperately, not compared to one another constantly because each game has its own feats that the other does not.OKAY so let's actually talk about H1 now... in it's current state (not including the updates being included with today (April Updates), the game is still enjoyable to me. While it definetely has its issues, such as desync, players exploiting lag (chinese players on US servers) and many other bugs or issues... the core gameplay is very consistent to me and still very enjoyable. The issues this game has are nothing that makes it unplayable in my opinion, and I honestly appreciate the game in its current state.P.S. I actually like Daybreak, I know shocker right?"

SORRY IF YOU DON'T AGREE.ALSO PUBG HAS FIXED ALOT OF THINGS I'VE STATED.If you're stuck between PUBG and KOTK let me just break it down for you.KOTK PROS -•	Fast paced•	Will run much better on most low end computers, don’t try to buy PUBG if you don’t have at least a decent computer•	Nice art style•	Consistent updates•	Simple•	Very entertaining with friends•	Spawns are completely random•	Good time-to-kill ratio with headshots (as in feels correct when shooting, I feel like I'm doing damage)•	Car mechanics work fluidly in this game•	Great skins•	Ranking system is greatKOTK CONS –•	Hit or miss when it comes to hit registering (better hope you’re lucky)•	A few very minor bugs•	A 1 in every 500 chance you run into a hacker of some sorts•	Game ends in a few set areas so it gets old after a while but a new update will fix that•	Not many different variants of guns (new one coming soon)*out now the HellfireOverall I love KOTK and I personally prefer it, but I’ll still put it to you straight on PUBG.PUBG PROS - VERY CONSISTENT UPDATES•	Very realistic looking graphics and weapons•	Weapons can have attachments•	Huge map•	Hiding is pretty good (especially in wheat fields) which may be a con for you•	Map helps you find your way easily (very noob friendly)•	Ability to choose where you land to a degree•	Many different map settings•	Weather occurs•	Character movement is absolutely dope in my opinion•	There’s boats•	More weaponsPUBG CONS –•	Misleading weapon mechanics and time to kill•	Cars are clunky and all around just do not work well•	The ability to choose spawns makes players spawn in a very linear line which isn’t my favorite honestly (and no you cant reach almost any point when you drop out, you can go pretty far though)• 100 (from what I've had in games at least) people spawn compared to 174 in H1Z1 which just makes H1Z1 more actioned packed•	Kick and bullet drop on weapons seems to be not as polished in my opinion then KOTK•	You have nothing to really play for, there are ranks (stats wise) but H1Z1 has a way of making you feel more rewarded with placements (yes you get points at a end of a game in PUBG so you can get your 6 cent skin)On the bright side of things, I do believe PUBG has a way higher ceiling then KOTK so it could easily prove me wrong.So there you have it. I was trying my best to not be biased but overall KOTK is my game. Don’t get me wrong, they are both good games and have their own futures. Should be great to watch them grow. Hope this helped.

As you can imagine, it eventually got stale and was slowly toxifying our relationship due to the nature of CS GO and Civ 5.  I should mention that we are a mostly competitive group, so getting dicked on in Civ or berating each other in CS GO was getting old after 1-2 years.Eventually, two of the people in our group decided to pick up the game, much to my disgust.  I remember when it was supposed to be free, then it became $20, then they split it up into TWO games for $20 each which left me appalled.  I also had a VERY sour taste in my mouth for early access after Cubeworld, DayZ Standalone, and about every other Early Access game that had come out.  Yet my two friends raved and raved about how much fun they were having, to which I would respond ""50% rating on steam"".Well, after deranking from LEM in CS GO, I decided that I was done with that game for a while, and I needed something else to take my attention.  I ended up playing a lot of The Division, which was another game chock full of broken promises, but I enjoyed it a lot.So I eventually got tired of The Division and caved in and bought the game, and man oh man was I♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥when I first launched it.

I tried to play for just over an hour, about 15 minutes was actual game play. The game constantly gets stuck on loading screens (entering the game or loading the lobby) and only took me back to menu once after a game, the rest of the time it crashed.Graphically the newer map does look better but its still nothing amazing and the sounds are mediocre at best.As for the gameplay, its exactly how I remember it being before the split; Awful. I drove my car at full speed right through a player and he got away without a scratch... Then later on while being chased full speed by a police car, the passenger jumps out (still at full speed) and instantly 1 shot kills me while I'm still driving.If you want a very arcadey/broken game, buy this. But be warned, you'll want to smash something out of frustration!Save your money for when PlayerUnknowns BattleGrounds comes out, that game is legit!"
,Not Recommended,433850,21509152,"Posted: 27 February, 2016",all,Levi the Terrible,"So anyone in the dark, this used to be a game mode in H1Z1 and is now it's own stand alone game. The split was unnecessary and it reflects a poor quick cash grab on Daybreak's part. Even within their devblog updates, they fail to give any legitimate reason why they should sell 2 products for double the price and change nothing (aside from taking away Green Dawn). There are similar Battle Royale style games that are sold with plenty of other Survival games that are just as comparable, and don't encompass an entirety of a $20 purchase, but are instead an added feature or game mode, as this used to be. Get Rust or DayZ, which offer this and many other game modes, and what I would consider a more tight experience. As an alpha game, this is just dizzying and not worth the money, and it's not even a complete experience. Having already owned H1Z1, I still play it, and it's an enjoyable game, but it's not worth it, and a company that would try to pull something like this is not worth your cash. Sorry Daybreak; ya goofed!"

The thing that I cant understand its we all know such a greedy - stingy company is DayBreak, But many people can't buy keys-cases because of the shift+TAB problem, But they are insisting to not solve this damn issue and let people have fun. Its annoying A.F. When people text me from steam, I cant answer without pressing ALT+TAB, I cant buy keys-cases in no way, when my friends invite me to lobby i need to ALT+TAB again.I bought this game approximetly 1 year ago, trying to fix it since last summer, spent around 6-7 hours to fix and haven't done a progress at all. I hope someone sees that, rather than seeing that, i hope they give a **** about that, cuz im really having fun with this game and my fun-meter would increase 150% if the steam overlay would display."

,Recommended,433850,29346605,Posted: 18 January,all,garnc,"In it's current state KotK is one of the most buggy and broken shooters you'll find. With poor optimisation and a company driven by nothing more than money with no regard to it's player base, Daybreak is really pushing the limits.On the other hand, the game concept is something you won't find elsewhere in this style and it has a lot of potential. Once you're actually able to join a game you'll see that graphically, it looks fairly nice (with the odd few clipping errors here and there). Gameplay wise the game is very balanced too, in which respect a new player is able to join with absolutely no disadvantages or advantages other than personal experience. Although money hungry, all microtransactions are thankfuly kept cosmetic.You'll compete to be the last man (or team) standing in games of up to 200 odd people at peak times. Winning won't come easy and you'll likely be faced with tens or even hundreds of loses before you reach that end goal. With enough practice and determination you'll get there, and it will feel great.There is a fairly large learning curve which may take a while to get the hang of but if you're willing to put in the time and practice, it will prove rewarding. Along with that, the community isn't so bad either, you'll meet some nice people and have hillarious encounters although as with any game there is a fair bit of toxicity. Of course if it's not for you, you can always toggle voice chat & stick with friends in teams of up to five.You'll spend countless hours in this game having your patience tested while you wait in a thousand player queue and if you have a short temper you'll easily rage at the poor servers & game breaking glitches/bugs cutting your game short that you'll certainly come across. Along with that, idealistically, you wan't a better PC than the recommended on Steam due to it being so intensive.However, overall the game is something painfully amazing. If you're someone who is willing to look past the bugs every so often and if you enjoy competitive & 'tryhard' player vs player action, then this is certainly a game for you."

AK fullspray at medium range is also far too effective.-They know they should have added recoil patterns to the guns similar to CSGO, but instead they added ""bloom"" similar to what destiny and other games did, this straight up ruined skilled gunplay as now shots are no longer predictable under recoil, as they randomly spread in a circle instead of an understandable pattern that may take skill to compensate for.-Cheaters are now more common than ever, and these are not the kind wether or not it is a question that they are cheating, more like they are straight advertising cheats for sale in their name such as ""FuZhuQQxxxxxxxxxx"" (FuZhuQun means auxiliary groups, which means cheating groups, and obvioulsy replace the X's with numbers) and for those who dont understand, QQ and YY are chinese social networks and instant messaging softwares, and they have their number in their name so you can contact them to buy their software, this is not speculation on my part, I know this because I have many many chinese friends that I play this game with and I have just asked them about these names etc without implying anything while asking.-Daybreak knows full well about this but they honestly do not care because if they have delayed bans they can make money off of the cheaters buying new accounts periodically."

,Not Recommended,433850,28967121,Posted: 2 January,all,I'm in the Lodge,"I currently only have 15 hours on this game, and choose to play it casually as a nice change of pace game with friends, so keep this bias in mind as you read:H1Z1: KOTK at its core is a a fun game--randomly parachute into a large area and find weapons, vehicles, and supplies haphazardly scattered throughout the map to survive and combat enemy players/teams. It is a very interesting concept and definitely yields some fun moments as you play the game, especially with friends. As I write I can recall a couple very cool instances, whether it be sprinting to escape the gas as it closes in the safe area, or even using the well employed VOIP to communicate with random people in the community and have some fun. Unfortunately, however, I cannot in all consciousness endorse this game, and definitely urge anyone who reads this to beware buying this.One of its major flaws reside in the game mechanics and its consistency. Any sort of interaction with others players, including gun fights, melee fights, and even riding in vehicles with others, is awful and inconsistent. Hitboxes are horrible; theres definitely a steep learning curve to using guns, and any sort of melee combat is useless. If you so much as come within 3 feet of a wall, you will be prohibited from firing your weapon, which is especially awful in all of the close combat that exists in this game. Opening/closing doors occasionally doesn't register. Besides these coding problems, one of the biggest gameplay issues revolves around the map, which is roughly a huge 64 km^2 area. Utilization of this incredibly huge area is abysmal as safe zones are generally constricted to the same few areas in the south, and its pretty commonplace to spawn (via parachute) alongside multiple other people. This means that unique geographical features (such as the castle in the north) go unappreciated and parachuting in becomes less of a strategy and more of a race with 15 other people to a single vehicle or trailer (and thus results in massive bloodshed 10 seconds into the game in the form of one person beating everyone to an AK and racking in the multi-kills). Daybreak, the map size is awesome, spread everyone out! If I wanted to be real nitpicky I could mention the unrealistic car mechanics or rough character movement (i.e. when jumping/shooting), but at $20 and considering the numerous other issues, these small nuances can be overlooked.Another huge flaw in my opinion is the community. I know it's not fair to judge a game's community based on the actions of the select few, but unfortunately, finding someone yelling profanities over game chat is more consistent than even the game's mechanics. On top of this, there exists widespread cheating in solo (with individuals teaming up in a free for all) and teams (where multiple teams work together). This paired with one of the largest skill gaps on a videogame I have ever played is really frustrating. I really hate complaining about people who practice their hobby and get good at a videogame, but when one guy can 1 v 5 my team, my enjoyment suffers. Daybreak needs to introduce casual/ranked game modes, or employ some sort of ranking system where people with similar skill levels play each other. Finally, the community has communicated (in the form of spending their money) that they value aesthetics (in the form of microtransations) more than core game mechanics. Consider this for a second: a game that is in early access (and has been for almost a year) has made sure to get microtransactions working, but not even the game? I know the culture of videogames has evolved to include microtransactions, but I still believe a videogame company has an obligation to make a game that people paid for work before trying to further charge players and profit. I have unfortunately already voiced my support (by buying this game), but I know many have steered clear simply due to this fact.A final large issue revolves around networking. If you buy this game, prepare for lag. I'm not even just talking about shots not registering (which is actually a huge issue), but full blown desynchronization from the server I have never experienced in any other game before. There are *several* instances where my friends and I have ran into this issue which include: parachuting in but being unable to move or run for the whole match; entering/exiting a vehicle but the game doesn't register, and thus you are stuck in or out on your screen but the opposite on the server; and even randomly dying out of nowhere. Paired with an already large skill gap (yes, I know, mad cuz bad), and a wait period between matches just long enough to be annoying (especially when waiting for your friends to die), and these networking issues become an unacceptable waste of my time.To conclude, this game has a lot of unrealized promise. Daybreak could work really hard to correct even just a few of the aforementioned things and I'd be willing to change my review to recommend it. Unfortunately, however, this company will never work to improve their game. Why would they? People continue to throw money at the devs for the little effort they have put into the game as is, just so they can have a red AR instead of black. I have nothing against companies that try to tap into its player base for a little more profit, but when that becomes its mission statement, I have issue. I have issue with that company, I have issue with the community that directly illustrates their support ($$), and I have issue with a game that uses its generic ""Early Access"" label to hide behind its problems.TL;DR: All of the unsupported b*tching in other negative reviews have some actual truth to them."

,Not Recommended,433850,30597009,Posted: 18 March,all,Cat Valentine <3,"Summary - H1Z1 King Of The Kill is a large scale game which features a huge amount of players per game, It's a solo game were everybody starts from parachuting and then once you land you start off with nothing and then you must explore the map to find weapons to fight off other players, once a certain amount of time as passed gas from all directions with come closer and closer and fill the entire map, the last point that gas covers, is the place that you should strive to be. You can use cars to get there, the only thing you need to remember is everyman for himself and the last man standing is the winner.Pros- Good idea, the developers made a great idea for a game, a game in which you are to be the last man alive in a massive land filled with lots of players.Cons-Very buggy, omg, this has to be the worst game I've ever played for bugs, I would go through some of them but the problem is I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START?-Lack of content, very few guns, few cars, few everything if I'm honest.-Shooting mechanics suck, for real you never have any idea of where you're shooting, you could be shooting behind you could be shooting at the sun, I don't fu*king know.-Graphics suck, the rendering speed is just awful, nothing else to say.Verdict: I simply got bored of saying all the reasons why this game sucks, but it just does, I guess regardless of the games issues it's kinda fun due to the concept but that doesn't suggest that I like the game at all, or even recommend it. Sorry for this one, but I can't recommend this game."

(i have reported these players nothing happens even though it is against the rules) < lol ye right...Usual amounts of racism/hate/toxic players > people telling you to ""kill yourself"" are still allowed to play the game for some reason?Hit reg is much MUCH worse than csgo's infamous 64 tick servers.If you jump out of a speeding car and someone shoots at you for the first couple of seconds nearly all of their shots will miss you because the server thinks you're in a different place.Car physics, loooooooooooooool. What else needs saying.Eu servers are full of children which such high pings you cant kill them. (although i hear americans have this problem on their servers too?)Shotguns STILL dont work. They have never ""worked"" correctly. Even when this game was a standalone game and not split they never worked.The game has still not even been remotely optimized.Im not sure how many servers the company runs but its honestly a ♥♥♥♥ing joke.

While the game was glitchy and a bit overpriced, I was happy to give support to a game that was trying to get some community help, and would eventually sell a FREE product. A couple of weeks ago, the game slpit into 2 parts, BR and Survival. I personally only played the survival once and I didn't really have that jolly of a time, and I primarily played BR. However, while I now own both parts of the game because I was grandfathered in and recieved both seperate games, I find it absolutely ridiculous and unfair for them to split into 2 games, charging consumers more for games that are buggy, terribly optimized, and in some cases unplayable. I believe that Daybreak has not hired any new developers, so what was the point of splitting the games into 2 if the same exact people are working on the 2 seperate parts? I would be a little bit more understanding if they hired 100 more developers and we got concrete evidence that there will be changes that benefit the performance of the game but so far that is not the case. This game made a HUGE MISTAKE breaking into 2 parts, and unless they recombine the two games, I do not recommend getting either version of the game. Hopefully Daybreak will learn their lesson and stop being greedy idiots who make a money grabbing game."

Buuuut they never really executed  the survival rendition of the game well at all.This game is pretty ♥♥♥♥in fun. If you can get past the fact that the shooting mechanics are horrendous, and play with a group of friends, I guarantee you'll have a good time. 5 man mode is pretty lacking, since queues take forever and people generally play duo so you get less players to play against. Generally, more people leave the 5 man games than actually play it out. The game really shines when you land in a city where there's a lot of chaos. The tense aura that you get when you lurk through the streets not knowing if you'll be blown away by a 12 gauge around the corner is chilling.The weakest points of this game are the shooting mechanics, and the inventory system. They just don't execute the third person shooting well. If you go in 3rd person(which mostly everyone plays in) aim at a wall, shoot there, then go in first person, you're aiming in a completely different place. What a wonky way of doing♥♥♥♥♥♥ The recoil is cancerous, but you'll adjust to this shitpile idea of shooting soon enough. You won't be ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥es up like you do in CS:GO after you practice long enough. But you'll hit people every now and then, and hope they bleed out or they just suck worse than you. Either way, it's fun. But I would be lying if I said I never reflect on how bad the shooting is. If you want a display of great 3rd person shooting, you can go check out The DIvision. It pretty much sucks after you hit 30, but the mechanics are solid and definitely a blueprint on how to do 3rd person.The inventory system. The biggest issue I have with this is healing. I shouldn't have to pop up a ♥♥♥♥ing menu to heal. Get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together DayBreak. I know that's hard to figure out since you're trying to find ways to ♥♥♥♥ over your customers, but god damn. Theres an extra 2-3 valuable seconds you lose when you have to pull up the inventory then go to your bandages or first aid kits to stop the bleeding.

Watch it on Twitch before you make a decision to purchase, certainly.You get dropped into a big map and try to be the last person alive as you run toward the extraction point. The base mechnics and functionality of H1Z1 can be described charitably as ""wonky"" and uncharitably as ""terrible."" The shooting (specifically the weird recoil and bullet drop) is very questionable and not ""smooth"" in the style Call of Duty or Battlefield games(at least modern BF games-its hit detection often reminds me of BF2).This is the least acceptable a game can function while remaining moderately competitive. It IS competitive, partially because everyone is in the same wonky boat and partially because the only thing the Devs have focused on since the game's Twitch popularity exploded is percieved balance issues and squashing hackers (the number of hackers ~1 year ago was staggering). I very much wish there was some kind of rough ""deathmatch"" game type; you will likely die in 100 Battle Royales before getting used to the gunplay.Again:Watch on Twitch before you buy.

An overall very rewarding game and with PUBG out, it gives the developers a reason to push out updates that will match the new BR on the block. The updates have shown a beneficial buff to the game as it should, and they continue to promote the members of the community that deserve it.It's relieving as a player to see see the game moving into a more positive motion, with the many positive streamers that promote the game and it's community (i.e Flamehopper of CLG). The competitive season is just starting to ripen up as they are attempting to discover new grounds in this genre, which is very exciting for players such as myself that finds this game to be very skill-based.However, you should not be led to believe that this game is not without bugs.

They legitimately can´t fix ANYTHING in this game without causing something else to break. You wait a month, two for the next patch just to find out that the majority of the issues aren´t addressed, some bugs are months and months and months old. Servers are some of the worst in the industry, de-sync is at least a full second in this game and after most of your deaths you'll be left with legit question marks above your head on how did you just die?!?! Skill gap in this game is very little because of how random it is and inconsistent. You can Two tap one guy and then a minute later witness majority of your bullets do nothing to the next guy and end up dead, get a frame skip where your game legit freezes for a split second or get crazy lag/de-sync where you peak back behind the corner but the guy still gets a shot or two or ♥♥♥♥ing two taps your♥♥♥♥♥even though you got behind cover. Hit registration is just awful and the guns in general are inconsistant, especially shot gun. Sometimes you one shot kill someone full health 10 feet away and the next time you stick your shotgun into the guys mouth, deepthroating him to no effect, not even a gag. Basically, you're rolling a dice in every gun fight.TL:DR. This game is garbage and i hope DayBreak sells it to some big time Publisher that will pass it to a competent dev team to piece it together.

(No sorry DayBreak, it's not on my end, centralize your servers pls.)In the past 1-2 weeks, the memory dump/or whatever garbage that causes so many problems after x amount of consecutive rounds has gotten so ridiculously bad.  Ghost bullets, blinking players, ridiculous glitches, you name it, the game feels like it's reverted back to it's original launch stages.For some reason I'll get 1 decent lobby, and then right around the top 20-30 players remaining, I get spiked up to a 2000k ping, my gun gets locked for the rest of the match and the lag won't drop.(Again, not on my end, I even run speedtests during the match and have amazing numbers, both up and down.)This game would be a great game if they would worry more about the servers, and less about their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cosmetics that they're obsessed with getting players reviews on.As of now I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this game.Wait until this game gets fixed, if it ever does."

There are still a ton of issues and the development team seems to take two steps back after moving one forward with every patch or update. The problem for me was that as a new player there is absolutely no way to properly train. The practice/training mode is just plain terrible as you can never find any loot, the weapons don't re-spawn apparently. It took me almost a month to get any confidence at all in gun fights because the only way you can practice for it is to queue a game and hope you land in a populated area and fight as often as possible. The problem is that a lot of these players have been playing for so long that they've mastered two tapping or first person shotgunning. Meaning that unless you get the jump (hiding) on them you stand almost no chance.The amount of two taps I've been getting is insane; I can't even play the ♥♥♥♥ing game anymore. Every encounter is now 5 shots or less. If you don't immediately two tap you're dead. What is the point of even looting for body armor when my last 7 or 8 deaths out of 10 are from a series of head shots in under 2 seconds. If there was a way to improve helmets to take additional shots I wouldn't be in such a rage at the moment but still...The game also has probably the worst development team in recent memory. Every ""update"" causes more issues, the hit registration is still off and there still is some bug or glitch I encounter that ruins my game around 5-10% of the time. They are either severely understaffed or incompetent, neither bodes well for them. I'm ashamed to say I spent around $60 to get crates for new skins and that wasn't even enough to get an ultra rare item. I'm done giving my money and time. I'll patiently wait until someone else develops a similar game and play that instead. The only reason I've played as long as I have is because it's a unique and fun (when there aren't bugs/issues) but I've simply had enough."

Killing others is satisfying and the gunplay has a learning curve that may take a while to get used to (it took me about 2 months). I personally feel like i got my 20 dollars worth. However, this game has more issues tan you can count. The main issue is that the developers are greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who just want yor money and don't really seem to care about anything but your money. This game was intended to be free to play after it was finished, but just recently they made the content that was oroginally $20 to $40. Instead of giving us updates with bug fixes and more content that will make the game more complete, the devs decided that they would spend the majority of their time just harvesting our money via case openings. The developers priorities are ♥♥♥♥ing embarrasing, sorry for the language. A few months ago they removed molotov cocktails since they had some sort of bug going on with them. They haven't been put back in the game, and im assuming the devs just figured we'd forget about them because the update after they removed, they decided we didnt want fixed game mechanics, instead we wanted new undies. That's right, they released an update after removing the molotovs thats main purpose was to add a few new character skins, and change the color of their underwear. I honestly can't understand their thought process when they first started the game it had such promise, but now they've smeared♥♥♥♥♥♥all over those promises and made themselves possibly the worst developers of all time. Buy this game if you like killing people and simply that. If you expect the game to be more than justs uing the same guns and cars every game, you will be dissapointed. The game lacks content severly, but it is damn fun to kill someone who's been trash talking you (which will happen pretty much every game since the community is just a bunvh of edgy children)If I were to give this game the rating it truely deserves it would be a 1/10."

Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor.Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together.Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!"

H1Z1 is still very fun for me because I've never played a Battle Royale. H1Z1 is fast at the start and starts getting slower, which is good in my opinion because it allows you to differ your playstyle throughout your whole match, maybe from Passive to Agressive, Agressive the whole game, Passive the whole game, Challenge every player you see or just try and have fun killing people and see how far you can go!Here are my pros and cons about H1Z1: King of the Kill.Pros:- Fun guns, balanced too (except the Shotgun, that thing makes no sense)- Movement is easy to get a hand off- Good crosshair diversity- Hitmarkers are very easy to see and sounds are good (except Footsteps)- Driving isn't hard- UI is big enough to see everything you want- Fast-ish pace, slows down late game.- Challenging to win, it's not super easy.Cons:- Buggy inventory- Hitreg is screwed- Shotgun is really weird, especially with the hitreg.- Desync- Server Issues- Games ruined by teamers / chinese people that lag in NA servers. (Only NA, EU doesn't have this. EU only has teamers.)- Crouch SpammingExtras:- Gas should definitely become faster, it's way too slow, you usually only have 50 people left in the 1st safe zone, and the 1st safe zone is fricking massive.,- Safe Zones should become smaller earlier on.- Fix your stupid hipfire, it literally has no inaccuracy.I recommend this game, bugs can always be fixed, same with server issues, desync and hitreg.

I got to about 75 hours of playtime on one if my old accounts and eventually grew really tired of this game.I couldn't play with the amount of bugs this game had, the gameplay was incredibly choppy, it wouldn't run as well as it should have and so much more. It just wasn't the fun game I wanted it to be. I only played it for about 3 weeks.However, coming back to it months later, I see there has been quite large changes to the game as a whole. The game runs so much better, isn't as choppy, a better community, with many other improvements since I last played. It's become s much more enjoyable experience, although I still haven't played it for long enough to consider it a great game yet.Keep in mind, this isn't the account I usually play on. I have it her accounts.Is H1Z1: KOTK the best Battle Royale game in the market?From my experience - definitely not. The experience is rather enjoyable, however it still has a few bugs that need to be fixed; but they aren't exactly major. I've grown to enjoy many other battle royale games, this being one, and do not favour this one specifically or use it as my go-to game when I want to play something.However, with all that said, H1Z1: KOTK is still a pretty sweet game and I do recommend getting it if you're into this sort of gameplay.I plan on spending a lot more time checking out this game and experiencing a lot more with it.Hope this helped."

Many of which are created within tight knit cheating communities and those that sell the cheats.Put hours into the game - only to have your wins taken by cheaters consistently.Currently the development team has been unable to make any major progress in addressing the cheating that takes place. This is an ""early release"" game that has been in development for over 17 months.Recently this game employed BattleEye but it only catches hacks after the damage has been done. The obfuscation offsets are found within minutes to just a few hours after every update. There is a serious lack of authoritative server-client architecture due to, what 'seems' to be, a focus on performance & the amount of players a server can hold while lacking detail to security.Let's pretend cheating is not an issue. The game is awesome! Sadly that is not the case.

I like the fact that you can jump out of a moving car because it encourages offensive playstyles and less camping.This game is fast paced and fun with non stop action.

,Not Recommended,433850,31003007,Posted: 7 April,all,Shpookzy,"After almost spending my entire life (almost 1000 hours, including the original H1Z1) here is my final review for you guys.It all began 2015, where the glorious H1Z1 has been released. At this time the game was full of bugs, well I didn't judge in those days, because it was an Early-Access-Version of the game.Though it had a lot of bugs, it was really fun to play, with friends of course.At this time you actually were getting rewards for winning, even if you were playing in a group. Nowadays you will not get rewarded after winning when playing with a group. So for some people (including me), the motivation to win was missing, since those days.After the Developer Studio switched and reorganized from Sony Online Entertainment to Daybreak Games (TheyBreak Games ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ) the game was on their way to fall down.You couldn't see any progress in developing, major bugs existed for months, the priority list of Daybreak Games was disastrous. Well though I had those bad impressions, I wasn't missing the fun at this time.In 2016 they made the decision split the game into two. H1Z1: Just Survive and H1Z1: King of the Kill. I had hope in the developement of this game again, because I thought maybe it will help them to organize themselfs better and to set priorities.On one side I was happy that they brought some new stuff, new gamemodes to play, events, etc., like Ignition, Skirmish, Green Dawn, Hardcore, but on the other side major bugs still existed. But for me, it was still fun to play.Later 2016 they have made their biggest mistake. They (re)-""launched"" their game (fun-fact: its still in early-access) and promised a major change in gameplay, graphics, performance and developing. So let's see what the ""launch"" brought us:(1) They have removed the old map and replaced it with the new Z2-Map. You might ask yourself now, what, is so bad about the new Z2-Map?:- Though they promised graphic enhancements, they've just increased the color saturation, to pretend, that graphics are better now. But as you might guess: They are not even close to better. The lightnings in the buildings are worse then ever. You can hardly see the loot inside of the buildings.- The actual reason for why the map was changed was that the devs thought, that the original map was maybe a bit too much copy and pasted. Here is my opionion on that: The new map is even more copy and pasted. Almost every buildings looks the same.- There are no real memorial places or fighting spots, like they were on the original map. Maybe it is because that I am a little bit nostalgic, but people who have played the original H1Z1 will understand me, when I rave about PV Police-Station, Radio-Tower, Opfer Camp, Reservoir Dam, B2, Hospital, etc, etc...- Loot is clipping inside of the textures so you cannot pick it up. This bug exists since almost half a year now.- Floating trees and ugly streets and textures are daily fare.- They won't give us the opportunity to play the old map, since they ""deleted it by mistake"" so they said. (Another fun-fact: the old map is still available in H1Z1: JS, so there is no way that it had been deleted)- There is no pit in the new Box of Destiny. Where the hell shall summit go then?(2) They have made a major change to the Interface and the HUD, which in my eyes clearly looks fancier but is actually worse than the original, because it seems really unclearly to me.(3) The translations are actually worse than google translator.(4) They have removed previous exlusive gamemodes, so you can't play them anymore. Well there is the ability to do so, but there never had been an event where you can play them.(5) They brought in a new rewards system and removed the old one. Unfortunatley, I never could experience those, because as you might noticed, I was always playing with friends. But nope, there are still no rewards for groups.(6) The performance is still as bad as in the old H1Z1.You might ask yourself now, why did they make those changes and why did they relaunch the game?Clear answer boys: to market the game more efficient.I have lost faith in this game and thats why I felt the need to write this review.I have the bad feeling that this game won't get any better, since the problem-solving approaches from the developers are slow, less efficient and mostly alternative and do not treat the cause of most problems."

,Recommended,433850,31814048,Posted: 17 May,all,ShotgunFunRun,"Let me say first that this game is very addicting, and is one of the most fun shooter games i play (Besides Rainbow Six Siege). H1Z1 is a mix of hunger games, but constantly keeps you moving to the middle of the map, and keeps you busy looting, and crafting items. This game is a VERY high recommendation to any types of players regarding the negititve rewiews. The reason the reviews are so bad is because the game has some small bugs it needs to fix, but the majority of the problems have been taken care of, and H1Z1 has gotten me to buy 100$ worth of crates, and I really can't stop, i love the feeling of the teamwork in this game. You spawn in parachutes, and command your team where to land, and how they are going to devise the plan sush as one player grabs a car straight ahead, while the person next to him gathers loot for the both of them, then another player (first on to recieve an AR-15 and a helmet), goes ontop a building and gets nearby players in the open. Finally the last two players gather enough spare gear for the team such as military backpacks - medpacks - ammo - weapons - you name it. Then you all rush into the safezone, and deside whether you have enough gear to circle around in the vechile and start picking off some kills, or not risk the players of your team and stay and loot until your packed with gear, and wait until there is below 30 players.9/10Would Buy"

First off, a huge majority of early access games are going to have bugs and probably lots of them. If anyone is expecting an early access game to have little to no bugs at all is a fool. It is called early access for a reason.Secondly, a game of this caliber is bound to have bugs. I, myself, have ran into a few, but it's okay. Some people are giving this game some very harsh reviews because it doesn't live up to their expectations. In my opinion, the concept is excellent and so far, I have ran into a couple of bugs that have resulted in my death. Which is okay, but I'm not going to bash the game or the dev, i'm sure they are working hard to patch up the bugs.Thirdly, I have a lot of fun playing this game and every playthrough is just as intense as the last. It is a blast to loot houses and hope to god that someone doesn't come running through the front or back door as you are looting. The base of the game is pretty solid and the concept is strong. I like it a lot and I believe that people need to stop being to harsh and down right rude, because they get killed early or they die because of a bug. Life is to short to rage over small things. Stuff happens and complaining won't do anything.Lastly, I want to congratulate Daybreak Games for making a very good game. Keep up the hard work!! I cannot wait to see what the end result of this game will be.Remember, kill or be killed!!Happy hunting!!"

No1 should encourage these developers keep what they doin. They just want ur money.  Queue times are long too. Yes you can have fun but is it worth it? Most of the time the game is unplayble.

When its down to the last few people and your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tightens in fear then you and your buddies mow down the last guy and you win. its an awesome feeling.BUTThere is a lot that the dev team neglects, then says they will fix and never do. So let's weigh out the pro's and con's.Pros:-The concept of the game is a lot of fun. Land, loot and survive.-The map itself is fairly large and there are a lot of cool places you can loot. From dams to residential neighborhoods to small campsites spread throughout the map. All with decent loot (sometimes).-Driving and riding in vehicles. Turbo and the E-brake make driving a lot of fun.-The PVP combat can be both exhilarating and completely infuriating. It really depends on who gets the jump on who and who gets armed first.-The matchmaking is pretty solid wether you want to roll solo, with a buddy, or with a team of 5 so there are options. although 3's would be cool.-The loot system/crafting system is pretty cool. You can craft body armor, explosive arrows, bandages and more that are vital to survival.Cons:-GLITCHES AND BUGS-Sometimes the before mentioned locations you can loot aren't always on the ground. By that i mean that they're glitched 10 feet off the ground and although you cant see them on the ground theyre still there and in the way. very annoying.-getting into vehicles while crouched will give you a glitchy view and will leave you essentially useless tryin to fire out of a car. Even when you can see youll at some point accidentially shoot someone youre riding with and kill them.-Starting off and not knowing the ""sway"" trick with the parachute and not getting to the ground first to arm yourself will leave you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥because you literally cannot defend yourself against someone who landed first and was lucky enough to get an AR right off the bat.-Sometimes your parachute will spawn upside down or doing some funky stuff guiding you in the complete wrong direction. Youll also sometimes just fall through the ground and wont be able to move or do anything.-Hit markers when firing some weapons dont appear when they should. Shotgun is either mad OP or completely trash.-Vehicles can get stuck on random objects and leave you stranded when the gas is closing in.-The fact that you get tons of loot crates you cant even open without purchasing keys with money is stupid.-you dont get much credit for winning anything except a singles. after 10 5's wins with buddies i think we deserve somethingAt the end of the day im goin to continue playing the game as i do enjoy playing with buddies but the glitches and bugs are starting to get annoying. Hoping and hoping that the devs can actually fix the bugs and make this game as awesome as the potential it has."

I didn't have a lot of experience with similar types of games before, and I'm not a great player, so I can recognize when I've been outplayed vs just being tilted, but I feel like this far in I can leave a ""seasoned"" review. Honestly, it seems the devs for this game are just totally incompetent. They cannot fix one tiny thing without breaking half a dozen other things, almost every update. They've ""fixed"" hit reg at least a handful of times since I started playing, horrible dsync, silent footsteps, broken doors, broken floors, massive(!!) teaming, cheese kill mechanics (that they ""fixed""), random car explosions (esp when you spawn in Africa), unlootable loot, unhittable Chinese players (but no region or ping locking!) No rewards or incentives for winning duo or fives games. First queue of the day, guaranteed DC. Tab out, DC. Afk four minutes, DC.  No new maps or game modes, but there are pay-to-play ""events."" Can't seem to fix any of the known issues, but can pump out new $3.50 loot crate themes like hot cakes. I wanted to love this game and not be a negative nancy about the devs like it seemed most of my friends were when I picked it up, but I definitely see it now for what it is."

All they do is release crates and skins when they are useless. I strongly suggest anyone playing this game or liked its gameplay to try out player unknown battlegrounds. PUBG is 10x better, devs always releasing content and patchs, while h1z1 devs don't do much but add skins for money cuz all they care about is money. PUBG has more vehicles and weapons ranging to  hand guns, submachine guns, shotguns, assault rifles, DMRS, and sniper rifles. While H1z1 only got around 8 guns. 4 handguns, 1 shotgun, and 3 rifles. Got really boring after a while of finding the same guns over and over again. PUBG also got weapon attactments for certain guns which makes gun customize amazing in PUBG, but h1z1 doesn't.

,Not Recommended,433850,31229130,Posted: 18 April,all,Taketheword,"This game is a sinful waste of a fantastic idea. This game started with genuine potential and brilliant ideas. When I started playing it, it was by far the buggiest game I had ever played, but I saw the potential. I won't completely reiterate what hundreds of people have already said, but they completely destroyed this game. As others have said, it started with the changing of hands to Daybreak. Daybreak is simply milking this game for all it is worth. The game had very solid, raw gameplay (raw in a good way). But instead of fixing bugs, they added skins. And instead of getting a clean version out for a release, they 're-released' the game (yet it is still in EA). Splitting the game was potentially great. I for one didn't care for the zombie side, so a focused Battle Royale game was exciting. Their obvious and biggest mistake was their huge 're-release' update. They replaced the original map which was FANTASTIC and again 'raw' with a glossed up piece of crap: Z2. The new UI was complicated without necessity. The old UI had some oustanding flaws which could have easily been patched up, but instead they replaced it with an even more flawed UI. I am just appalled by what has become of this game.TLDR: This game was a fantastic idea. The raw, simplistic style that made this game so great was destroyed by marketing. Developer focus transitioned from true development to a marketing tool. Don't waste your time with this game anymore.PS: I have all 3 green dawns (all legit), and I have 1k hours on H1Z1 (500+ hours pre-split). I truly feel bad for anyone who didn't get to experience this game pre-split. It was on the road to being a historical classic."

I have to say the game has not changed graphically, gameplay wise. The map is bigger forsure which is awesome, theres tons of character custimization if you are into that. However when I tried changing into anything but pants it resets my character for some odd reason. The game seems to run worse which is odd because I remember h1z1 running at a perfect 60fps with little stutter. The moment I started the game the menu was like super zoomed in which was odd, although I fixed it. Then there were the custimization problems and my character kept floating away and the menu camera would stare into the sky which is really weird. I wouldn't reccommend this unless you get it for like $5 bucks or something. This game is not worth the current price especially since its been in early access for so damn long it's basically the new DAYZ battle royale style. So much potential went to waste."

Who is their target audience????)Up until 2017 the devs LITERALLY DIDNT SEE DEVELOPING THEIR GAME AS A PRIORITY and this is the biggest mistake they could have made. One that was easily taken advantage of by anyone willing to invest in properly ""stealing away"" the audience that was fed up with Daybreak by this time.Thankfully, other people saw the game going down this path and decided not to tie their existence/careers to something ran by people so obviously fat jewish and lazy. ThePlayerUnknown was one of these people. His team made a game 200x better than this wacky♥♥♥♥♥shit that no one plays anymore. So s/o To PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds- buy that.TL;DR: The devs didnt see this game as worth improving until ""ThePlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds"" came out, and was INFINITELY BETTER- GO BUY THAT."

No sights or attachments for the guns so the gunfights are identical everytime. This game is a shell of what the devs promised us and has just turned into a crate selling cash grab. The issues with the game are ignored and the little content that is added the community doesn't even want. The devs are so out of touch with their community that its insulting.

You get killed from a guy that is running away from you by shooting a bullet from his backpack. You get stuck in buildings at start of the game because you parachute into them and can't get out. A lot of people is using aimbots and wh's, it's turning into a APB. When this game was at it's peak they would ban people for 2 days for using cheats, now they just don't do it anymore because they need every person playing this game.Since these new changes, you can't even get a lot of kills, I've used to get 10+ kills now you are lucky if you get a spawn with people around you. That new circle mechanic is just dumb. It's just afk loot, drive a car until you are in small circle and that is it. After mine 431 hours WASTED on this game I would gladly want to get my money back if that was possible.From now on, I'm staying away from this company. Things that they have done should be illegal.

,Recommended,433850,29046862,Posted: 5 January,all,Googie,"The Good:+Large arena with a variety of settings and scenery+Gameplay mechanics encourage players to stay on the move+Randomness of spawns in conjunction with above means every game feels drastically different+First or Third Person view options make it easier to fit your playstyle (stealth vs aggressive)The Bad:-Graphics are decent, but lots of ""floating"" trees items ""stuck"" in surfaces-Customization options are too difficult to unlock, mostly tacky rainbow clothes-Players can cheat to spawn with weapons at the beginning of the gameThe Ugly:---Where are the zombies?---Pay-to-Play in daily events---Microtransactions in an unfinished gameThis is a really, really fun game. For those who are familiar with Left 4 Dead, classic CoD, or any other arena style game that requires weapon pickups, the learning curve is fairly simple. The arena, however, is much, MUCH bigger. Spawn by parachuting in at a random location in a large map, gather weapons and gear as quick as you can, and make a game plan to make the most of your one life and make it to the top. Despite what you might assume, there are no zombies to shoot, kill, or avoid. (Though, it'd be a nice inclusion in my opinion)If you're looking for a fun new survival challenge in a large PvP format, this game is worth checking out.Essentially, it's last man standing with a time limit in the form of poison gas. As games go on, the gas encloses ""safe zones"" - which acts as a way of weeding out stragglers and campers. Once you get to the last 20 or so people, the active safe zone (which gets smaller as the game progresses) is small enough to keep things from being to crowded yet still forces players to fight for the win.There is a customization aspect to the game, as you can unlock clothing for your avatar in the form of loot crates as you play. However, this function feels vastly overshadowed by microtransactions... Considering the game is still ""unfinished,"" it seems strange that microtransactions are even implemented. Earning loot crates from regular play is extremely tedious, and doesn't feel like it's worth the trouble. Loot crates are overpriced, and don't really give great rewards often unless you buy over $50 worth. Seems like a racket to me.As with any unfinished game, it has it's share of bugs. I feel as though the developers spend more time planning new microtransactions and Twitch events than they do working on bugs. They're on the final stretch for finishing the game, so fingers crossed they divert their focus accordingly."

I can now confidently say that the developers litterally don't care about anything but money.Before, there were less servers(16 tick) with a longer wait time but now you can enter a game instantly. It seems that by adding more servers they decreased the quality. I have never had under 100ms in game and I always hear the sounds of screaming asians before game so I know theres no way of predicting a shotgun shot that has to land five feet infront of someone so that it registers for some kid in F'ing asia. It constantly spikes to upwards of 3000 for no reason. I get 600 mbs upload and 700 download so it's not a problem with my internet. As soon as the server ♥♥♥♥♥ the bed it warns you that you have too much packet loss and locks your weapon or vehicle. This doesn't work well when you're spawning in and can't fire a weapon, enter a car, or drive in the right direction.The team focused on a new map and skins instead of adding better servers and an equal distribution of loot. Right now the only weapons used for the majority of the game are AK, AR15, and the Shotgun. They have balanced the weapons by making everything else practicly un-useable. If you think the melee in the comercials looks cool you should find a different game.The amount of times this game crashes is insane. I have no idea if it's because of the lag or the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ optimizing that the team did.

This game is full of bugs, glitches and issues. Lets start with spawning in. I land on the ground, well land is a poor choice of words, i slam into the ground and the game decides that i cant move for a second or two. WHY? Im then sprinting for a gun and press F to pick it up only to see that a person about 5 feet behind me has picked it up and has shot me in the head. DeadNext round, land, same glitch. This time im alone. I get my guns, i get some ammo, i get armor, helmets, and bandages. I start working my way towards the gas free zone. i dont see anyone for a good 20 minutes. I get down to the final 15 without shooting a single time. I then see a car driving towards me, i start firing at it and the car wizzes past me and i am greated with a shotgun to the face. DeadThis game is just plain and simple terrible, Between the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics not allowing me to see players to the poor latency issues with the game as a whole. I wish i could get my money back for this turd. What a waste of $20. My recommendation is to wait for PlayerUnknowns game to get some steam.

'casual' players dont care for skill gap, they dont care for getting better at the game, hence they want the mechanics to change rather than to get better with it as is. Daybreak aspires to make this game E-sports and then incessantly caters the casual players to make it E-everyone. LIKE WHAT DO YOU WANT? I feel its unclear what they want even to themselves.This combat update is utterly absurd.. altering bullet mechanics not only renders the 2-3k hours of experience that i and so many people already have vain, but in a way (between bullet tracers and bullet mechanics) makes it immensely more feasible to obtain the gun skill that would have otherwise taken thousands of hours. and to no ones surprise... the new players love it... This game is turning into something it is not and tbh if they go though with this patch, i may throw in the towel after all this time as the changes are outright detestable.And on a personal note; I find absolutly disgraceful as someone who supported this game so much as to even have a positive review for the game open publically to be ban for hate speech for simply telling someone that their opinions on the update are irrelevant for lack of experience."

They have made a step in the right direction by somewhat making the shotgun better, but dont get excited. There is a reason that almost all of the big time streamers left and when to play PUBG, H1Z1 isnt even on the top 10 front page of twitch.

76561198068896895,Not Recommended,433850,31047468,Posted: 9 April,all,asmolinski48,"Man where do I begin? Well lets start with when I bought this game close to release. The hype was real back than. It was an enjoyable clown fiesta at first. The bugs were there, but the hype and fun clouded that...Unfortuantely however, around 2 months later they updated some stuff which rendered my game completely unplayable. This happend right when I bough the game for my friend. Right when we tried to play the daybreak launcher would open for 2 minute and go black for me. (While still counting gameplay hours) So a week goes by and I get tired of it so I send a email. I tried everything they told me but nothing worked. They even began ignoring me. You could just feel their corporate greed and disregard for their players. So I gave up. About a year later I got a new pc and thought to myself ""Oh h1z1 should work now"" And to my suprise it did. I started playing with my friend but he quit after a few days, because guns and doors wouldn't load for him unless he waited 2 minutes. So I started playing myself. Slowly but surely the fun turned into agony. I thought to myself ""Surley it's my fault I'm getting all these bugs and not the game.""  I thought that for quite some time until I started playing duo's and fives with my other friends. And watching videos.  Bug after bug, crash after crash. Every other game we would get stuck on the ""sending you to game mometarily"" screen. And the only way to fix this was to re launch. (While still counting gameplay hours)The hit registration got/was so bad (My guess is the unstable code) that the shotgun was no longer viable. This was after a year in early access amazing right? The driving was almost as bad if not worse. You would always hit invisible objects and explode instantly. Combined with the ping spikes it was unberable. Months later the game is still the same. Only the ping was fixed and shotgun (barely). Seeing hackers is normal now.  This made me realize my first feeling was spot on. Daybreak is the prime example of corporate greed and incompetence. They rather focus on advertisment deals and micro-transactions than their players.If you are seriously considering buying this game you need to ask yourself these questions.1. Do  you value your time input?2. Do you enjoy playing video games with friends?3. Do you enjoy skill based gameplay with no worry of hackers?4. Do you expect mutual respect when investing in a project?5. Do you want your voice to be heard?6. Do you expect competence from the developers?7. Do you expect the anti-cheat to work?8. Do you expect the game to work?If you answered yes to any of these questions do NOT buy H1Z1!!B.t.w I would say 150 hours of my time record is dealing with bugs and glitches and not even playing the game...Battlegrounds or Last man standing is the real game for you."
76561198056181761,Not Recommended,433850,28414625,"Posted: 16 December, 2016",all,Nickaru,"There are a lot of problems for this game, even though it is early access.Load time: Overall the load time is not that bad, but the thing is there is a Queue that you must wait in for sometimes long periods of time, which I am talking about 10 to 20 minutes of waiting.Gameplay: This is the main thing I dont like about this game. I thought it would be a pretty amazing pvp game, but what I got was a buggy game not worth the money. Off the bat it is unfair, as you start by parachuting down into the world below looking for a vehicle and supplies. Once you got a gun you'd think it would be pretty easy to aim and shoot, but in this game I find it more difficult than any other game I have played thus far. For a shotgun as an example, you could be standing point  blank firing two shots into your enemy's body and MISS! But by the time you get two shots out, your dead as the physics for guns and vehicles are not great for this game. its basically the same with any other gun, except when your enemies are playing. You must be very dedicated in order to be on a DECENT level with this game, because you can FINALLY get some shots on a person but it wont matter as they will somehow kill you even though they have been damaged more than you, and or someone else will come up behind you and kill you. (Mind you this is mostly on solo)Vehicles: This one is not so imporant but a big role in the play. Everyone who has played at least an hour knows you need a vehicle most of the time to survive, depending on your spawn. The big issue is that if the glass is broken, IT IS UNUSABLE! The second problem would be that you could be going top speed with your parachute and someone beats you to the vehicle at the last second. It would be a bit easier if you didnt get paralyzed and jump when you land, but eh. If you managed to get a vehicle though, your in for a treat as if you run over a pebble, it is flipping over. No joke you can go over the simplest of terrain and still flip your vehicle.Conclusion: The game is still in its Early Access and would probably (hope!!!!) fix all these issues in the future, but for now I suggest you wait unless you want to experience how ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T this game is at this stage in development."

We play in a team of 3, I'm just getting to learn the basics.One of my teammates dies soon after we landed, the other one gets shot few minutes later when we were looting. I manage to kill the attacker and now I'm alone with more than 100 other players alive.So I just hide inside a trailer and wait... and wait, lucky for me I am in a pretty good spot (G 6), gas wasn't coming in my area. At some point, when there were around 30 people left alive, I decide to leave my spot as gas was coming my way. I manage to kill 2 guys driving a car and follow my way up the hill.Fast forward, there's 7 of us alive, I'm really excited to have gotten this far. I was on TeamSpeak with my teammates describing what's happening and asking for advice. The area without gas is becoming a tiny dot and forcing us to meet... Considering this was a match of up to 5 players teams, I decide to hide after some trees and wait for one of the (at least) 2 remaining teams to kill the other one so I could actually stand a chance.And then it happens... game closes, no error, no message, no nothing.

Impressive.You can go through a whole match and get like 5th place and just not see a single person the entire time even if you're looking, or you can die immediately, it's pretty fun and unpredictable.The whole gas closing in on you concept is a fun way to force conflict from people who tried hiding the entire game so they could get ranked higher. Eventually everyones cornered and they have to fight.  There's a multitude of different weapons, gear, vehicles, and other fun elements that are completely different game to game. And you never have to wait for a match because the games literally always full of people (which is the most impressive thing about it; I have never played a game that required 175 people for a queue and never had a wait time).Funner with friends I think."

To this end, I hold M&M duels. Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the “loser,” and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round. I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world. Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment. When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3×5 card reading, “Please use this M&M for breeding purposes.” This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&Ms. I consider this “grant money.” I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament. From a field of hundreds, we will discover the True Champion. There can be only one."

Although the game suffered from little updates and poor everything, since Battlegrounds the dev team seem to realise the pressure on them right now and does seem to be trying to help the community.I hope this game still has a future."
,Not Recommended,433850,32140887,Posted: 2 June,all,ThatWizard,"This game is great to have when you want to play with friends but then you instantly realize your mistakes when you do. It's fun when you win of course, but that will never happen unless you are experienced with the best aim of all time. Now if you are into stealthy games, you may like just sitting and hiding until a 1v1 situation, but that is so goddamn boring because the matches are usually 20-40 minutes if you get far in.Firstly, they recently changed the shotgun. They made the shot a consistent circle so the shot is always the same pattern, unlike before where the shotgun was a literal 12 gauge shotgun with somewhat random spread. The shotgun tends to randomly kill someone through armor, and then sometimes proceeds to take 4 shots after armor, make it completely inconsistant. I get killed from medium distance with 3 shots from a shotgun sometimes when I have an ar, even when I have a laminated vest. For some reason, it is better to shoot at the legs of the enemy instead of the chest or stomach because that basically guarentees a 1 shot kill most of the time. Please make a shotgun that uses a slug if you want to make a long range shotgun daybreak. Secondly, the game tends to glitch out in menu screens and loading screens.Sometimes the game won't load in after sitting for 1-2 minutes even though it should take 30-1 minutes, meaning you have to then restart the entire game and load again. If you click the spectate button and exit out, then the game has a 99% chance of being stuck on the loading screen. These glitches have been in the game for literally months (or maybe even much more) yet daybreak is  inefficient when they try to fix things most of the time. There is also the hitreg issues and lag issues where shots sometimes go through people or people hit your helmet off 1 second after you are behind cover. Cars tend to randomly explode when running into certain objects for some goddamn reason.There is also the battleeye ""anti-cheat"" system, that literally has no effect on stopping cheaters from entering the game. There is a report button that you can use, but they probably won't ever get banned. If you play this game, be warned that you will definitely find every single types of hacks, even ones I haven't seen before where they can go below the ground and shoot you from under. There are speed hackers, aim hackers, literally everything. If you were to get hacks right now I guarentee you will not get caught (unless for some reason they end up actually doing their jobs).So there are like literally 6 guns in this game (no attachments), and only 2 of them are useful late game and are the only used guns. Now there are 2 bows that can be used with explosive arrows to deal massive damage, but guess what, explosive arrows may not kill even if you stick it on them. The AR15 and 12 Gauge Shotgun are the most used guns, and there is no variety to the guns.Now moving onto the cars, the ATV and Police Car are the fastest vehicles in the game compared to the jeep and truck. When you parachute from the sky, you may want to get a car and will lean toward the closest or best car near you, but be wary that there are usually 1 or 2 other guys with you. Now, sometimes you can land on top of the car and die from environmental damage, and other times you will leave freely. If you are going to shotgun rush somebody with a car, there is a slight chance that you will get launched further than where you got out of the car (potentially taking more than 50 damage of fall damage) screwing that push completely. One frustrating thing about these cars is the 35 health rule, where if the car is under 35 health, it cannot use its nitrous and loses its complete viability. You may as well ditch the car if you know people are near you, and it is really annoying when you need to escape.H1Z1 is sometimes fun when you play with friends, and there are definitely funny moments that occur, but 80% of the time you hate the game and want to uninstall it, but then proceed to play another game realizing your mistakes. There is a reason why other players have moved to a better built game called Playerunkown's Battlegrounds, which has been out for 3 months since this review. I have tried to launch Battlegrounds when I bought it, but for some reason it wouldn't launch so be careful. There are some dedicated H1 streamers like stormen who is a god at the game and two taps all the time, but if you are not skilled enough, you will die really easily to a pro royalty player or some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I recommend Battlegrounds, the game that most old H1 players currently play, and it is a great party game to play with your friends.I hope this review influenced you to change your mind on wasting this money on this poorly built game, and please go buy something more useful."

Now, I do not deny that the developers might have been unfair with those that purchased the game, but in my opinion game reviews have to purely reflect the quality of said game and not refer to any outside problems. That said, I'm giving H1Z1: King of the Kill a thumbs up.For an early access game, H1Z1 has delivered a lot of joy to me, especially while playing with friends. This is one of the best ""Battle Royale"" type games out at the moment. It maintains simplicity (a small selection of guns, generic items, things to do), while delivering a solid gameplay.Other users have reported bugs, fps drops and network lag, but I am yet to encounter any of those.There is a problem, that every now and then you encounter an aimbotter, who ruins your 5-10 minute game. Thankfully, these are quite rare.If you have friends to play with, want a fun, memey, slightly cancerous, while also competitive game, buy it. You can also play this by yourself, but this is more challenging."

There is currently this phenominon called ENOSing, I think it's called, where basically, if you're within 25 yeards of someone, they just jump around and alterate A and D quickly, and they're nearly impossible to hit.Oh, and there have always been slews of cheaters, using aimbots, aimscripts, and wallhacks like crazy, it's all over youtube. I'm not sure if it's due to the engine they're using, or what, but there is no stopping that with this production package.Calling something ""Early Access Alpha"" for this long is ABUSIVE and leads a trail of lies and deception towards avid and casual gamers alike. I'll refer to that in a moment.I'm sure someone will read this and say, hur dur dumbass if it's so bad y u has like 1000 hours in (both the original, and after the split) game lulz?! Well, I'll answer that simply enough. I had hope for this game. I have owned it since both H1Z1 games were one, before the original Battle Royale was even thought of, and it was very enjoyable. Although, it was minimalistic, and had some limitiations, it was fun. There were a decent amount of bugs, but not much that was complete nonsense or downright exploitable/""game breaking"", if you will.Another thing, the meta of this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's all the same♥♥♥♥♥♥every time, AR-15 two-tap contest. If you can't AR-15 two-tap, you're in the bottom 25% percent, and you will not enjoy your time spent. Then there is the ENOS thing again, everything feels entirely unnatural and repetitive in most aspects. This isn't doesn't even feel like a shooter, just a mechanic exploit contest a good deal of the time.And especially DO NOT get this game if you expect a first-person experience. You will get absolutely HASHTAG REKT.It's not acceptable for the development group to absorb that much income from this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ and simply delay any promises. I am curious if the ""Early Access Alpha"" title is merely there to avoid fraud claims? No, obviously you can't sue a game developer because you think their product is poor, but there were some fine lines here too, arguably, buying the skin keys could be a tax skirt for gambling income on both sides.

It still feels like it needs work but after everything that's been changed in what was pretty much a $20.00 title I don't know if we can expect much more. It's been recently overhauled which I was unsure of but have grown to like. Further development and updates for this game have been more back and forth than I've ever seen in any game.You get your typical mixed multiplayer community with some questionable encounters.  More controversy over changes then you would ever need to see. One thing is for certain, you will need both a high speed internet connection and a high end PC for the new updates or you will hate your life. There's a bit of a learning curve by design and you will die a lot. It's not noob friendly, it's fast, it's difficult, it's not fair, it's not balanced, there's more luck involved than you think, it's cold and it's brutal. Sometimes there's lag, sometimes there's cheaters, sometimes there are good players and sometimes you f*** up. A good round feels good for a reason because you will struggle to earn it and that's mainly because there is entirely too much teaming, no cheat protection and so many inventory bugs and glitches. If you can get over that the hit detection is horrible and the damage per hit has not been correct since release.By far the worst hit detection in a FPS I've ever seen. The damage application based on the damage output of weapons and the armor mitigation doesn't work correctly either. All they update is the way the game looks and not how it plays. Love the new map but nothing else is really any better."

,Not Recommended,433850,33796641,Posted: 25 July,all,Rufwatt,"Don't bother with this game. There is much that is yet to be fixed which the devs do not seem to care about.First and foremost, the beginning. Upon entering the game you start with a little training session which allows everyone to connect which is a good start but then later on when the real game starts it does not wait for everybody to load in before you drop using your parachute, instead you just go straight in meaning that the people with the best pc / fastest internet have a game changing advantage often leading to you getting mercillessly killed when you have no weapons due to them getting first pick and of course taking it all.Secondly when dropping using a parachute the players are dispersed out equally meaning that equal amount of people will drop in the country-side as there are dropping into the city. This means that up to 10 people could be fighting over a small country house meaning that whoever gets in first gets a gun to kill unarmed people by shooting them in the back when they are defenceless.Thirdly the game developers do not seem to take into account the idea of cheaters and it seems that the report button doesnt do anything as i have encountered the same (blatant) hacker three times after reporting him twice.Finally There is no skill-based matchmaking meaning that a level 1 could, and always is matched into a game with level 90 players and even higher. This is clearly unfair as they have more of an idea on tactics and it makes it hard for a new player to learn the ropes and get an idea of shooting and surviving in this game as they get instantly killed.I would strongly advise avoiding this game at all costs and simply invest it in Player Unknown's Battle Grounds, The rival of this game and most probably the better game of the two. If i could refund this incomplete and blatantly unfair game now i would!"

However there don't seem to be any new models added since I played last which felt a little lazy.Died almost instantly in the first 5 matches usually before finding a weapon.I was encouraged because I don't want it to be easy.But I have noticed by now that there are only 3 primary weapons, lots and lots of player model customisation and I can't ADS. Strange, but oh well.6th match, I've looted well and I'm alive which is novel. So tooled up I start running for the safe zone but notice my ping sharply rise from 32ms to over 1,000 and I promptly get disconnected.7th the same thing happens.Check my connection and it's fine better than fine in fact.I'll try again over the next few days but as it stands I have to say I can't recommend buying H1Z1 for KOTK.And if I'm completely honest what I really want to play is PUBG.Take from this what you will but frankly I think people here are right and you should skip this and go straight for Battlegrounds.I'll edit/change this review if my experience over the next few days improves but I'm highly sceptical that'll be the case.Next day: Servers down and no explanation from Daybreak as to why or how long for.Uninstalled."

Those days are over.This New update hasn't completely ruined the game, but instead its added  more and more items that were scarce in the older version of the game.Getting into the first game on the new update, I had the game set to my previous settings so that the game would be playable for my PC. Not the lowest settings, but enough that I will have good frames and be able to play smoothly. As soon as I get in, the game is so blurry, and the render quality is so bad that I can't even tell what items I could pick up.Attempting to play this game made me sad. I want the old version back. I wouldn't recommend buying this game. This update has done nothing for the game but make it look like a game that would be professional enough to have a celebrity invitational game.The customization menu is the only thing that they should have changed from the older version of the game. You are able to choose what clothing, weapon, or vehicle skins you would like to equip before getting into a game. This eliminates the hassel of having to put on your desired outfit in the pregame lobby, and you are more likely to join into lobbies that have shorter waiting times to get into a game.Overall, I don't think I can recommend this game. It was fun while it lasted. Maybe i'll revisit this game in the future. At this moment the game feels like it has changed too much to quickly."

Since the start when this game was released I thought it had much promise. Now coming to it in 2017, it has failed what I wanted it to be. It took the route of skins, where developers spend more time creating ways for microtransactions then updates. Still bugs, still glitches, still have hick ups that are not smoothed out. Even from when I started this game a few years ago. What a joke."

It is very tactical and rewards patience and skill (in a more satisfying way than with CSGO in my opinion - especially in solo Battle Royale mode - as you are not dependent on other players to do well). It can also be very chaotic (and nerve wracking). I've bounced around a few games of late but can't remember having more fun gaming than  with H1Z1 KOTK for a long time.I'm relatively new to the game so don't understand (or frankly care for) a lot of the negative review complaints on here - i.e. Splitting the original game into two separate ones. The same goes for micro transactions. These are simply cosmetic items that aren't pay to win in any way. Plus you can easily win swag for free by placing in the top ten of matches (which is very doable so long as you don't Rambo/Leeroy Jenkins).If you are thinking about trying this game but the negative reviews put you off please do give it a go. It's a very unique and rewarding game. Most importantly of all - it's fun!

Yes H1Z1 has many flaws but as soon as they tweak a couple things, the game will be on top once again. The only reason PubG is popular is because big streamers play the game so everyone has to do what big streamers do. Which is fine but all in all I would have to say H1z1 9/10 and PubG 2/10 but that is just my preference."

It's biggest competitor right now is PUBG. PUBG is still a fairly new game and has 4x the amount of weapons H1Z1 has. PUBG is the new trending and prosperous battle royale game. The only problem with PUBG is it is really slow paced and I personally hate the map, H1Z1 feels much more complete and engaging. Like I said PUBG is still a fairly new game with tons and I mean tons of fustrating bugs but it has alot more potential than H1Z1. If you like a fast paced, interesting and engaging map, a unique art style, and competitve game definitly get it when its on sale. If you can handle the numerous bugs and unengaging map then go ahead and pick up PUBG. Nonetheless, they are both great games but, if you had to decide between the two games I would recommend PUBG because, of it's longevity and potential.Oh, and best of all have a great day! :D"

I need to force close the game.Controls feel really slow, as in deadly slow. I want to hop in a car I have to spam my F button, I want to crouch same I have to spam my crouch button because the game simply doesnt respond. Same goes for picking up ammo and weapons, controls dont respond immedeatly if they respond at all on the first time.Despite running a decend pc well beyond the specs recommended I have framerate drops and lag.When the match is done sometimes the game itself decides to close down, for no reason. When it doesnt close down by itself theres about a 25% chance it will be stuck on the loading screen.The game itself is solid and could be a lot of fun, but when its this broken it sucks all the fun out of it.tl:dr => Bugfest, you're better off spending your money on a decent finished game than this garbage"

You will never be disappointed from this game. The game is awesome. All you need to do is to learn how to play the game and understand it. It has special and diffifcult aiming which isn't like any game. Aiming is hard for everyone and this is why it it amazing for me. You will look to improve your self everyday and you will see that you are aiming better from time to time. You have many options to do in the game. I give 9/10 vote for the game. I really like it.Training mode up to now is very bad. You need to read and watch twitch, youtube ,etc... to know how to aim with each weapon in the game, because all the weapons are different in aiming. There is no training mode that you can train your self with guns aiming to bots or any objects with different difficulites. Also, There is no instruction for the beginners about what they should do in game and how they craft everything.Wishing that daybreak give more care about the game glitches and bugs to fix them.Regards,Hyp"

The vehicles are overall better in most aspects;2. Loot is easier to spot since it gets highlighted;3. More fast-paced and chaotic;4. Weapon, helmet, and armor skins;5. Better case and leveling system;6. Ranking system;7. Hitmarkers;8. Overall a more polished game.The places where PUBG is better than H1 are as following:1. Better character movement;2. Parachuting system;3. Gun attatchments;4. Minimap,5. Weather,6. More weapon choices,7. Boats instead of driving through rivers;8. More than 1 sniper rifle per game,9.

This is a recipe to your FAVOURITE DELICIOUS CHICKEN CURRY SOUP! I never knew that was a thing but apparently it is SO IMMA SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE IT!Ingrediants, 1 Tablespoon of peanut oil. 1 clove garlic, minced? Half of a peeled and diced carrot, 1 (14 ounce) can of coconut milk, 1 tablespoon of green curry past. 2 Skinless boneless chicken breasts halved and cubed. ( WTH IS CUBED? )  2 cups of chicken stock, 1/4 cup of chopped green onions(Where do you even get this?) 1 lime, juiced. That's about it.Step OneHeat the oil in a medium pot over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and carrot, and cook 5 minutes. Mix in 1/4 the coconut milk. Stirring constantly, bring to a boil. Mix in curry paste. Place the chicken in the pot, and toss to coat.Step TwoReduce heat to low, and pour in the chicken stock. Cook until heated through. Stir in remaining coconut milk, lime juice, and green onions. Continue to cook and stir at least 10 minutes before serving.(I'll add a little about this game so I don't get banned)This game is good because it is. You literally just die 24/7 and if your computer has under 30fps you have a 1% chance of getting a SINGLE bullet off on someone.

It's glitchy, the servers suck, shooting guns is near impossible because of pure glitchyness and inaccuracy and to top it off its a $22 dollar game (Canadian) that stuffs microtransactions right down your throat every single menu. Of course you can only get skins but the game makes a strong effort of shoving every deal, new skin or any small new thing right into your mouth. This game is so damn glitchy that %70 percent of the games I get put in halfway through I lose the capibility to do some crucial function such as sprinting or switching from my fists to a weapon sometimes losing my vision all together. I attempted a reaninstall and the same things ocurred. I know it has the ""early access"" tag on it but seriously any devs who spend more time on skins and crates rather than game breaking bugs can't use ""early access"" as an excuse. This game is lots of fun when it works but it is far too glitchy and broken to be enjoyed at this time."

I think more people would notice it if there wasn't bullet delay)Everytime they update the game, they take it down for 4 hours which always turns into like 15 hours or something stupid.Also the shotgun sometimes decides that it wasn't to fire blank bullets, as if all the other bugs weren't annoying enough.All in all, it's a good idea, just very poorly executed by a development company that think keeping the game in Alpha for years gives them the right to not bother fixing the issues"

Sounds fun!!. There is however only one big glareing flaw that many players notice when playing this game and that is the simple fact that you can theoretically experince everything the game has to offer in one game, given the nature of its gameplay. On paper this type of game seems perfect with seemingly endless replayability as you look for new ways to strategicly take down your enemies or make a crucial decision to engage your enemy or leave your losing battle to re equip yourself.H1Z1 KOTK biggest flaw is that the game wasnt originally suppose to be a battle royale brawler. Makeing a new game based on the same mechanics of your original does not support healthy gameplay and can lead to terrible balance issues, lack of depth, and a lack of self personality. However for not being the game they originally designed and promised when the original H1Z1 release (Now called H1Z1 Just Survive) i can confidently say that the developers of this project have been only moving forward with this game, giving constant updates and provideing a great vanity progression system that does nothing but compliment the theme of the game just that much more.This game does have it's problems but that doesn't mean you cant have a great time with it and the being one of the top most played games on steam only proves this to be true. Hopefully in the future we can see more updates giving us more variety in gameplay, through gun attatchments or new maps. Overall H1Z1 KOTK can offer you some great experiences and if you got a few friends I dont see a reason for you to not pick this game up.6/10"

From a failed ""launch"" last september, an awkward shotgun that either works or it doesn't, and the fact that Daybreak has yet to add another weapon, another vehicle, let alone a consistent updating system just shows the downfall of this game.The gameplay is okay, bullet registration has been getting better but it's still the apitomy of♥♥♥♥♥♥ The whole vehicle colision = explosion thing is kind of expected.I would just say spend $10 more on PUBG, the community is growing and the developmental updates behind it are actually existent.

The only way you may play this with no problems at all or not many at least is if you have a pretty standard drive config, in which case you may have passed the first layer of problems that comes along with the launcher and now move unto layer number 2 of bugs and glitches that come with the game itself. From what I've heard this game has a lot of glitches that have not been patched since their appearance and also new patches bringing more bugs along with dumb cosmetic crap that doesn't enhance the game in any way, I have bought this game twice now in hopes of finding a fix or daybreak (developer) coming up with a patch for my several launcher problems.I won't buy this game again unless I'm certain they have fixed the game or added some kind of multi drive support, then I might be able to play this developer forsaken game."

King of the kill on the other hand has one enormous flaw which makes it impossible for me to enjoy. They can try all they want to balance all of the guns, vehicles,etc, but the spawning system in this game is ♥♥♥♥ing atrocious and a disgrace for any game that wants to be competitive. Do you have fast internet and a SSD/fast computer to install this game? If not then by the time you reach the ground others will have already got there and looted everything, you'll probably get killed on an instant. Not only that, you spawn at a random place. Compare this to PUBG where everyone spawns onto a plane, gives everyone appropriate loading time, and then let's you pick where to land. After I saw that, I checked if king of the kill fixed the god awful spawning, saw they didn't so I bought PUBG and uninstalled this garbage.If it wasn't for the atrocious spawning would I recommend this? No, last time I played the hit registration was also luke warm garbage. I have 1000 hours in CSGO. I have probably 100 in overwatch. My aim is pretty decent, but in this game you can be aiming right at the enemy, standing still, and miss every single shot while you get killed. If the enemy is lagging might as well just quit the game, you won't hit them. Imagine running around for 20 minutes finding guns just to be killed by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like that.That's the general issue with these battle royale games, there's a ton of time just running around. In PUBG, most of my deaths feel fair. In this game, very little feel free. I play with around 70 ping on both. I could just be bad, but this is why I don't recommend it. I had this since it was known as just h1z1, so I have more hours than what it says."

The IQ sum of the whole development team is not likely to be anywhere above 70 points, programming skills are worst than I've ever seen among people who are first year of informatics collage. The game is not rewarding by any means, if you do good and win games you will recieve absolutely NOTHING. The ranking system is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and does not make anyone feel worthy. The aestetics are terrible, way too hard to earn and way too ugly.First, you start to play the game, it feels funny, as if you were in Hunger Games, great concept.Then you start experiencing all kinds of bugs, funny ones and irritating ones.Some way along the road, you start getting good with your aim and stuff, and that's where all the trouble starts.The game will somehow find a way to make your car start flying in the air and explode all of a sudden. They will block your weapon, make your inventory unaccessible, block your movement, make you unable to loot items scattered around the map or what not. You will waste a lot of time trying to get good and after all, all you get from it is depression about having wasted so much of your time in order to achieve something you won't even get a decent reward for.The community is awful, all you'll see is people running up to your corpse to tell you how big of a trash or noob you are and spread hatered. How would it not be when the game is so broken and unfair?Then there comes the useless development team again... They do maintenanaces... often... and they tell you they will take up to a few hours. yes.... you end up waiting 20 hours for the game to come online so you can play it... after you paid 20 $ for it. yes.Ranks are a grindfest, the more you play the higher rank you will be and the bigger of a ♥♥♥♥♥ you are the more rewards you will get. E. g. they tell you something like "" bla bla you will get currencies to buy items for placing high and getting a lot of kills"" but of course that's not trueYou get rewarded for placing high, miserably.. Chasing kills makes absolutely no sense since for making a beastly effort to get a lot of kills won't get you half as far as camping the whole game out in one place. Makes sense, doesn't it?Then they try to pretend they give a ♥♥♥♥.. They make online surveys to make the game better!You feel great about that since you know how broken this game is, so you take them.What do you get? ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of questions about aestetics and purchasable in game items, of course, what'd they ask you about if not them making money?!?!If you try to play with your friends you will end up waiting in queues 80% of the time and playing only to get frustrated by one of you dying early or something like that since queues are broken and it doesn't register search same for every player in the team, if one cancels queue it will only cancel for him, not even if he was the team leader, so the rest will get in the game and then be forced to leave and queue again in order to play with him. Also it does not only happen when queues are canceled, sometimes they cancel themselves, sometimes they don't even pop up, sometimes, the game simply does not load, and sometimes it loads properly but it spawns one of you stuck in the concrete or air or some kind of an obstacle and you can't move and need to restart everything again.Mostly you spend your time trying to get the game to work. So you spend it doing the developer's job.Some of those people should really be banned from any gaming industry for life, they should turn to telecommunications companies since people are already used to those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s stealing from them.Anyways, I'm really starting too feel desperate writing this♥♥♥♥♥♥down instead of just uninstalling the game and dealing with the fact that DAYBREAK is the worst game development company that has ever made a name for itself on the gaming market and I'm never purchasing anything from them in the future.IF ANYONE IS ABOUT TO READ THIS BEFORE BUYING THE GAME, I STRONGLY ADVISE YOU TO SPARE YOUR NERVES AND MOVE ON TO ANOTHER GAME.

After playing for around 10 hours I was able to survive a little more when I played duos and fives with some ol' chaps of mine. Then once I reach around 50 hours I was nuts at 2 tapping kids and winning games. Finally the idiots over at Daybreak Games decide to release an update for the game that adds one good thing, spectator mode for duos/fives. Everything else was the most useless thing to ever add and just made the game feel so stupid, worthless, irritating, trash, idiotic, autistic, stupid, cancerous, and absolutely terrible. When you try to kill someone with a shotgun and they are point blank and even when you shoot them in the chest spot on it does 24 damage when they do the exact same thing it does 100 to you. Also shooting someone three times at the range of about 1 and a half jeeps with a shotgun it is barely enough to kill them whenever it only takes one shot from them to drop you to 24. I also love when you try to land and go in a building but get slowed nown by the clunky♥♥♥♥♥hitbox of the parachute colliding with the front of the store and someone else lands perfectly fine to where they can run in, grab a shotgun, run out then proceed to one shot you about 5 jeep lengths away.Pros:-New HUD for cars is pretty epic XD-Error 404: No more foundCons:-Cost moneyThis game is absolutely cancer and autistic and all that happens is you queue for a game then spend 5 minutes waiting to get into the actual gameplay by waiting in the stupid box where everyone just screams ""CHINA NUMBER 1"" like they have a mental, physical, and emotional retardation and their parents beat them right when they came out the womb because they were a mistake and will always be the biggest mistake to their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ parents that decided to birth them.Overall though, the game is very very enjoyable and worth it.

Alpha means that this game should be free since daybreak wont spend money to hire testers. and for that matter if i paid $20, i should get all the games conternt for free. free to play game make skins that look cool so if you want to buy them, the game devs then take the money and put it back into the game. that isnt found here, i have no clue where the money is going with all the people who idiotically buy 120+ dollars in creates, only for the money to be pocketed. the game was supposed to come out fully this year. but since daybreak decided to scrap the old map and implement a new buggier one, i hope it might be out fully in the next 2 years. if you buy this game you know what you are buying. buggs, no support, and all feedback is ignored by the devs who stream on twitch that have people in their chat asking when they are gunna fix buggs only for the devs to completely ignore them. love the game concept but the game is very unstable. and nothing justifies it when the game is 20 dollars and its this unstable."

It showed great promise at first, but has been on a downward spiral since then.  I am convinced they do not have the ability to properly develop this game and solve the technical issues which have plagued it from the start.  Granted, this is a game that is on a scale and scope which others have not done before, but you need to show real progress at some point.  DO NOT BUY THIS IN ALPHA.  They have made enough money at this point to sponsor its push forward, and now it is on them to develop it into a real product.  Do not feed more money into this.  They are getting fat and lazy.  Hopefully the competition from other games like PlayerUnknowns new game, Dayz, and others will kick them into gear.  They have had many changes structurally in their company, which I am sure is not helping.TL / DR - Only buy this after alpha."

I do not like the new map for this game. I loved fighting in a BR environment with zombies. It made everything more challenging and not as easy to spot other players.To give you an idea of how much this game sucks... my first three matches, I died before getting my hands on a single gun. On one occasion I parachuted straight to the ground without looking anywhere else. I couldn't have gone to the ground faster. Landed on the ground and someone else already had time to get a gun, load it and shoot me. It makes no sense whatsoever that someone already had time to even get their hands on a gun.My 4th match was the exact opposite extreme. I landed on the ground and geared up. I continued to wander around collecting loot. Didn't see anyone or hear a single gun go off. Since I actually had gear to fight I wanted to fight and coudln't find one. I ran in open fields and looked everywhere. I would not see a single player or hear a single gunshot until only 8 people were left. I killed the first person I saw. Within two seconds of me killing him, someone over the hill shot me immediately. I made it to 7th place and felt like I hadn't accomplished anything.Buy ""PLAYERUNKOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS"" when it comes out. He's the guy who set up BR for h1z1 and did the awesome mod for Arma 3. I have been playing the closed ALPHA for it and it will be a better game than this."

This game will get your heart pounding throughout and it's great to play with friends in a call. However, if you play by yourself it could seem rather repetetive. Furthermore, the crafting system is quite limited which constricts you from making lots of survival items- which sucks.

To go through the whole cycle of loading the game, waiting in the queue, dropping into the territory, running around to scavange for gear and then face another player, who's usually more experienced and shoots you dead within about two seconds is a PITA.  Then you have to go back and start all over again.  It doesn't make for a fun experience really.

After devoting all of their attention away from Just Survive to King of the Kill and still are being super lazy with fixing these problems I don't see this progressing in the near future."

Duo I have fun with a friend playing seriously and as banter. Playing in 5s is all out mayhem. Despite the bugs and error messages and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and spawns really close to other players and the fact this game is incredibly frustrating, I would recommend it. It's a fun game to play and you can play it your way. That makes it a very interesting game to traverse. Some games will last 30 seconds in a mad scramble to find a weapon. Other games will take 30 minutes in a strategic logic game. You just never know how any given game will go.Buy this game.See you on the battlefield comrades."

That being said, the game itself I've found to be very enjoyable with friends. There are moments of intense, heartpounding gunfights sparsed by looting and improving your gear. The crafting is simple and works well. The toxic gas mechanic keeps players from camping out for too long, forcing conflict up until a match's climax. Winning a match is no small feat.I'd say if you're looking for a battle arena game definitely snap this up. Again it's an early access title so expect bugs. If you can brush past them you'll find a fun game underneath."

If you do solo's most likely at least 1 of the final 10 is hacking. Most of the time people will use ESP but I do see consistant aimbotting in solo's typically near the very end of a match. The game it self is good but without better anticheat or moderators patrolling the servers, I fear the players will have to simply live with the hackers. This unfortunetly only drives more people towards buying cheats in the end. Without a swift relentless banhammer cheaters will ruin the game."

You have to read the map with the coordinates and use where it is saying the way you are going in the top right hand corner with north east south west just remember NEVER EAT SHREDDED WHEAT     NEVER-NORTH      EAT-EAST   SHREDDED-SOUTH      WHEAT-WEST do that from north at the top of the map going clockwise around the map and thats the technique you can use to tell which way you are going on the map.There is the odd qlitch and crash but its not such a big deal and it usually doesnt do it while in game.all round a great game and I greatly reccomend it if you are in to coordinated tactical games.

Firstly, if you are beginner - i am a beginner - waiting for game is a huge problem. You are waiting, waiting, finding a game, waiting again before game starts, and game is starting. Well, as i say, i am beginner, boom hs. i am dead. So, its okay, that is how you learn a game. But dude, you have to wait again... Wait wait wait. after 3 or 5 repeats, you are done and closing the game. You might recommend me to play training, but i will say thanks, no. Because when you join a training game later, you are surrounded by people fully armed and waiting you to come down from sky. I am afraid that they will kill me before I touch to ground.By the way, this is the best scenerio, you need to be able to start the game first. It is possible your game to stuck after character screen. You cant even go to main menu.Another story, there is a problem with dropping items, collecting items, scraping items, creating items. It means, there is a problem with almost 75% of the game.Maybe you will see it as a noob's comment, of course you are free to take it so because of my 30 hours record. But probably i watched the professional streamers more than i played, because the reasons i told you up there. I have no patience to wait that much to play a game.  Why I am telling this, they have same complaints too.So, I recommend you not to buy this if you dont have friends to play with. Because maybe only that way it's being a little fun.Edit: I must thank a lot to Player Unknown's Battleground to give this developers a real lesson. I'm playing the game after months and it's so far better. It also shows they don't give a s*** about you, they just want you to open crates thats all. They had to lose players to make their games better."
,Recommended,433850,32264459,Posted: 8 June,all,kidnikk o//o,"The game is very fun and can be played alone or in a team of 2 or 5 members. The goal is to survive until the end. Over 100 players start all over the map. After certain time intervals the map is made smaller and wrapped with lethal gas. All over the map are for example houses and campsites you can loot.Pro:- There are enough players so it will be exciting.- Animations and player controls work fine and smooth.- The map is well designed and provides almost everywhere loot places. Even if you end up somewhere away from cities you can find good equipment.Cons:- There are not enough weapons. Every round you try to loot an AR or AK and a shotgun. There is no greater selection.- The rewards are not valuable and worth barely. The most valuable thing you win at the first places are two different bags. These bags contain 1 of only 5 skins. After a few conquer you unlocked everything.- While playing you get randomly crates which can be opened by a key. But these keys are only available in H1Z1 Store and costs around 2.50 Euros.Conclusion: It's a really fun game with normal graphics. If you are looking for fun alone or with friends, this game is perfect for in between. But if you're looking for a game where you want to achieve something (like a level), you are definitely wrong. I'm wondering what next updates would bring, because this game is still expandable."

Cheaters, teamers,  and the inability to walk up stairs without getting caught on the bottom step. Seriously? What is so hard about making stairs? Every other company seems to have figured out how to make stairs work like stairs. Also, why is there a shotgun that won't kill anyone even from point blank range to the chest? Why is there a sniper rifle if it isn't a one shot kill to the head? There is no point in picking up those two weapons if they aren't one hit kills at their appropriate range. I can't explain why, but this game is very addicting and I would tell you to try it and not go completely off of my review, but if you don't like dealing with a bunch of stupid stuff in an uncomplete game then you probably shouldn't pick this one up."

76561197965925112,Not Recommended,433850,29241322,Posted: 13 January,all,Fire and Blood,"The core concept of this game is amazing, and I really hope another dev comes along and makes it correctly.  As it is, it's nothing but a huge money-grab from Daybreak.  It's in EARLY ACCESS, yet the only updates they do are putting new crates in.- This game is buggy and glitchy as hell.  In 10-20% of my games (not exaggerating), I encounter a common bug that makes the game think you're stuck inside a vehicle.  If it happens while parachuting down, your parachute will dissapear and you'll fall to the ground, unable to move or perform any actions.  If it happens while you're in a car, you'll suddenly exit your vehicle for no apparent reason, but be unable to move or perform any actions.  In both cases others see you in a vastly different position to where you are on your screen.  This is only one of the many bugs that will ruin a game.- Alt-tabbing often causes the game to crash (probably about 15-20% of the time).- A bug that seems to come up constantly (like ~50% of games) is that suddenly your voice chat won't work, and you can't hear any voice chat.- Queing as a team is a nightmare.  You can't invite non-friends, and if you're not the person who started the lobby, you can't invite anyone.  There is no chat/voice function in the lobby.  Furthermore, oftentimes when joining a queue, some people won't get it, putting half the team into the game and the other half still on the lobby queue.  If you've died and you exit the game, you stay in the group but have no way of knowing who is alive still and no way of knowing when everyone is ready for the next queue.  Every game starts with, ""Is everyone on the main screen?"" followed by, ""Does everyone have a queue?""- Oftentimes players crash on the loading screen.- Inconsistent spawn times based on loading give some players a HUGE advantage.- FPS is often low compared to other games, even on high-end machines.- There is no spectator mode, a year after it was promised.- Hit registration on this game is ♥♥♥♥ing awful, especially if the person is moving.  The lag compensation doesn't work well either.- There is no region/language lock, leading to the Chiners.  Because of the way the game's lag compensation and hit reg works, if you have a high ping it benefits YOU.  A lot of people from China play on the NA servers for that reason, and they teleport around like Nightcrawler, making them almost impossible to hit.- There are quite a few cheaters in this game, with cheats ranging from aimbots to ESP, etc.- The weapons/items balance ranges from inconsistent to bizzare.- There are relatively few different types of weapons and items.  There are a fair amount of grenades, but the grenade mechanics are horrific.  There are two rifles, one shotgun, and a revolver that are viable weapons.  There are only 3-4 other pistols in the game, all of which are non-viable other than in the first 1-2 minutes of the game.  There's no weapon selection, no choice, nothing.  They need to add things like SMG's, or at least weapon attachments to spice up the boring AR/AK meta.  Melee weapons are laughable, even in the beginning stages of the game.- Gun/item spawns are completely imbalanced.  You'll sometimes search 2 houses and find *zero* weapons, whereas sometimes you'll search one house and find 3 rifles and a shotgun.  Also, weapon spawns are TOO frequent, especially AR, AK and shotguns.  When I spawn and land somewhere and search a building, I should be EXCITED that I just found an AK/AR.  Currently, if I spawn and don't find an AK/AR within the first minute, I'm upset.- Grenade throwing mechanics are horrific.  The biggest issue is that they take up a weapon slot, and to use them you oftentimes have to manually switch them; this is a nightmare in the late game especially.  To use them in the middle of a fight, you have to open the inventory, switch the grenade (and each type of grenade takes up an additional spot) with the weapon, and hope you have enough room in your backpack to put your revolver in it, otherwise it won't switch.  Throwing grenades is also super-clunky, and needs a lot of work.- Car mechanics are stupid.  Usually, if you're on foot, and someone in a car sees you they will drive at you as fast as they can and then exit the car while it's going 50mph.  They *instantly* exit the car, and often they will suddenly just appear in a place that the car just drove past.  Because of this, they gain a huge advantage since they are already aiming at you, but you have to guess where they will pop out.  Also, the fact that they can exit a car going full speed with zero downside is a huge oversight in game mechanics.  They should have a split-second of vulnerability or at least take damage.  The lategame typically becomes everyone in a car zooming around each other like sharks, waiting for someone to accidently flip their car.  There should be a mid/late game EMP that kills all cars.- Sound is very inconsistent.  There are times when an enemy will suddenly be very near you without you having heard them approach, and there's times when you'll hear them a mile away.- Parachute mechanics are awful.- There is only ranked for solo.  Ranked for duo/5's needs to be implemented.- Lack of game modes/options.  There should be multiple maps, night/day mechanics, options to change weapon/item spawn amount, and maybe EMP.  When you queue, and get to the loading area, it should indicate a RANDOM map, then ask players to vote on night/day cycle, spawn frequency, and EMP.  Majority wins.- There is no meaningful way to train or test.  The ""training"" server is a joke, and the weapon, item and car spawns don't re-appear, meaning you're going there to get next to zero items, with 30-50 others.  There's no way to put yourself into the map and, say, try the sniper rifle out alone.Until they start actually making meaningful updates to the game rather than just cosmetic items for the money grab, I cannot recomend this game, or devs that treat their games and their customers this way."

CARS ♥♥♥♥ING EXPLODE RANDOMLY WHEN YOU GET IN. oh also dont plan of running anyone over to kill them because cars dont do any damage to people....... TIP 1. dont use the shotgun. apparently blasting someones face off with a shotgun at point blank doesnt kill them. Tip 2. the AK is broken. it has 0 range and its more innacurate than the famas in cs. The ar is the best gun but it sucks close range because of people who use shotgun.

,Not Recommended,433850,29706731,Posted: 4 February,all,Elderspy,I would absolutely not recommend this game.  There are balancing issues galore and it is very buggy.  My impression of the game is that they spend most of their time working on features to gain popularity and money.  Instead they should be focusing on making the game more playable.  I've had this game crash frequently and run into basic usability bugs with the interface that make me force close the game.  Once in-game it's playable but if you don't spawn next to a rifle you might as well quit and restart.  I hit someone with an axe for 20 seconds or so and it did so little damage they were able to find a rifle in that time and kill me in a couple of shots.  I regret purchasing this game and would warn everyone away from making the same mistake.

Another really ragey bug was getting into a vehicle with guns fully loaded only to jump out into a battle with empty guns.. what's up with that?I also feel the whole 'report a player in game using the quick key' scenario, is a little horse sh*t. What does it actually achieve? How do we know that instance does anything?

Sure, Daybreak invest to much time with crates/skins system, to make more money.But as you can see, many of the bad critics comes from peaple who played many hundreds of hours. They complains, but they keep playing it. Why? Because the game still very good.But as everyone, I hope Daybreak will fix all these little problems, so the game itself can reach a better status.Since the release of PlayerUnknown's Battleground, I think they are going to take this situation more seriously, if they dont want us all to move to this other game.I recommand this game!"

That is what this game consists of. What was meant to be a full release of a game has once again been put back due to the lack of effort going into fixing bugs and technical issues at hand. Daybreak Games (an Off shoot company of Sony Entertainment) would rather employ an entire outsourced art department to design more crates of skins for the company to generate profit than fixing it's title.Issues with the Game:-Ping-Regions-Not banning cheating advertisers for the game-High GpU usage-Regular bugs-Shot Gun-Chinese-Mass de-sync due to using a mmo server rather than fps.♥♥♥♥♥♥loot distribution in environment-lag benefits you.

I cannot recommend this game. There are many things wrong with this game, one of the things being hackers. If you play a lot of solo games you will know. You are in the top 10 having the game of your life fighting a decent player, (around your skill level) but then, a hacker speeds from out of nowhere and kills you both, this will then happen to everyone else in the match. Another major problem is hit registration, the hit registration in the game is well, Sh*t. The shotgun is the worst example of this. You will be in a situation where you are fighting someone with a shotgun at close range. And well, the shotgun decides to shoot ""blanks"". Recently, I played a game of duos with my friend. He was killed by somebody with an AR-15, and it was up to me to kill the guy who killed him. I used the element of surprise and came behind him with my shotgun. And unfortunately it decided to shoot ""blanks"". Allowing him to kill me in one shot. Optimization, the optimization settings for this game are poor. And really need to be improved. I myself don’t really have much to say about this… Daybreak are updating the game quite often. But no, they are not fixing the game, they are adding more skins. Yay! More money for Daybreak. Recently, they added a new update I myself have not played it yet, but I have noticed that people are complaining that is hard to see whether you get a headshot or not. As I said, I haven’t played the new update yet but I hope there is an option to change to the default crosshair settings if I don’t like it myself.This has been my first serious review, so if you don’t like it then sorry. This is how I personally feel about the game and if you don’t agree then that’s fine. Thank you for reading."

I was very wrong about this game. While unrealistic in car driving and other stuff it is very tactical still and decisions on where to go what fights to pick and other situations make this game very enjoyable. Gunplay still goes to PUBG from i have seen but this game has brought me alot of fun in very few hours. I have experienced no bugs and have gotten a good fps at high and medium settings.Overall this game is an easy 9/10

Nope, not really, so I gave it a go.At time of writing I've logged 79 hours and not really encountered any serious issues. Yes I have to delete my character every time I start the game cause else it won't load and yeah it takes 10 extra seconds and surely it is annoying.... yes that should have been fixed long ago or hotpatched bla bla bla bla bla.... but the gameplay itself seems fairly ""bugfree"" so far and that's really what I care about - at least it is comparable to A LOT of other games with ""Very Positive"" reviews that are considered to play fine without bugs and so on.So far I've experienced about 10 unlootable items (you can see them, but can't loot them), landed underground and been unable to play that round, had the game quit on me at the end of a round a few times and hmm... that's probably about it. It never crashed on me except after ending a round and loading to the menu and apart from the bugs mentioned above I haven't had any issues.Would really like to see a spectate feature for Duos and Fives modes so you can follow the teams ongoing struggle till the end rather than sit around glaring at a boring static frame for ages. (Seems to be a planned feature.)I've got little clue about Daybreak but from what I can tell they've managed to put together an experience that I find to be very enjoyable, at times super intense and often quite funny.The game might have deserved the negative reviews back in the days but at time of writing this I think H1Z1: King of the Kill is indeed a very decent game with a super high entertainment value. Definitely recommended!"

Instead I'm going to write why I, with over 200 hours played, love this game even though I know and experience all of the recurring problems with near every match.H1Z1 isn't perfect, but it's still, imo, the best battle royal game on the market. It is truly one of the easiest to play and enjoy, it is fun with friends and has a strong competitive side to the solos of it, as well as scrimmages hosted by third party h1 streamers or fans. This game is playable in many different ways, you don't have to be amazing at this game to win or progress far into a match, you can play with varying differnet playstyles, whether it be agressive or relaxed.All in all 9/10My only major complaints/problems with the game are:-The lack of ping lock, allowing other region players (Asia mostly) to play on NA servers and pretty much flying around on your screen making it very hard to kill-The lack of banning for people who team up in solo matches-The fact that the November update still hasn't come out... and it's December.*Post-December Update Edit*So, the game was FINALLY updated... we got a new season (or preseason), we got some new skins, they sorta kinda fixed the shotgun and they fixed one of the major exploits... was this patch good? No. Was it bad? No.Daybreak has some major issues at their headquarters, they are either understaffed or just dont give a ♥♥♥♥ when it comes to this game sometimes. To their credit they did address one of the major problems, the shotgun and now its about 95% consistent, which is much better than the 50/50 you'd get pre-patch. However, there are still many exploits and bugs they haven't addressed. Daybreak I know you care about your fanbase and want to see this game do well, so for the love of god address some of these issues please!- Ban. Teamers. In. Solos. Add a different reporting technique for reporting teamers rather than Ctrl+R, perhaps do Ctrl+""any other letter"" if you see this player is teaming in solos... It's the most frustrating thing ever to be killed by teamers in solos, believe me.- The snaking/prone glitch was addressed in the most recent patch, yet people are still doing it... fix it. Don't allow for people to get into a car while prone, simple. There's no reason that you would legitimately ever need to get into a car while prone if you WEREN'T trying to preform some type of exploit.- Reduce the solos que time in lobbies. The wait time, once you spawned into the Fort Destiny Box used to be like 90 seconds, now it is around 150 seconds, I know we're talking about the difference of a minute but it's noticable and quite annoying, at least lower it to 120 and meet in the middle."

76561198068718431,Recommended,433850,28964840,Posted: 2 January,all,RumDomRum,"Here is some advice for playing this game:Here are some do nots:1. Don't tab out for more than 20 seconds.2. Don't accept an invite while you have ANY  loading screens of any sort.3. Don't use prone too close to objects. You are very likely to get trapped in the map until the gas comes in and kills you.4. Don't let your screen-saver kick on while waiting in queue.Here are some do's:1. Give it a chance, you will have fun.2. Always go for the head shot3. Always fight from outside of a car.4. Verify your game cache every couple crashes.By far the absolute buggiest game ever created. This game is buggier than BF3 and BF4 were upon release. It will crash on average, every other match.  It doesn't disable your screen saver when you're in queue. When the screen saver kicks on because you've been waiting FOREVER, the game will crash. This game doesn't just crash, this game goes out in epic fashion by nearly rendering your computer useless as you try to bring up the task manager over and over and over... then, after you actually get to the TM, you MIGHT be able to End Task, you might not. Frequently you'll click end task and the screen goes blank as the game goes full screen, usually blank and sometimes with a border.If you can tolerate that crap, as well as the numerous bugs during gameplay where you get stuck, can't pick up items, spawn in the sky with no parachute as you walk on air or the extreme lag/latency issues every so many hours, then you'll find this game to be a blast. I can't tell you why it's so fun, honestly. I personally enjoy the realism of the physics, bullet drop, etc.Somehow, it's fun."

Also survival seems to be the dying one. In King of the hill I can find matches quick. but finding a high pop server in survival Seems much harder.3. It encourage you to play on LOWEST♥♥♥♥♥♥SETTING!! Why? Cause then things dont render.. What does that mean? Oww only that you can see people through grass, trees, Bushes,, Stones, Solid walls. Houses.. Sometimes even through all of them at the same time. Playing on high setting is a stupid idea currently. This game has been out for a long time now. And this was problem on day 1. Now years later.

You spawn into a game land and start looting when looting you'll find either nothing you need or half of what you need for example a helmet and backpack and no weapon or a weapon with no helmet. There is a 0.00000001% of finding everything you need in the first 5 buildings you loot. When getting into a gun fight and you're behind cover i recommend standing on your cover because you can't shoot over it even though it says you can shoot over it you'll probably need to aim 10 feet above it to hit your target  also half the time you can get shot through your cover because on the other players screen you're 10 feet left of the cover, so cover is kind of pointless. Vechicles are great. Lets just say you hit a pebble you do 15 backflips land it like a boss and your reward for landing it is blowing up it happens roughly 5 times a game most likly more. If you think you can get use to all that and all the bugs in the game this game is for you."

For some reason that I can't understand, this game is incredibly popular despite being having almost no updates, almost no weapon variety (less than 5 primary weapons in the game), and just overall being very repetitive and infuriating (this is coming from someone who plays this type of game frequently. I know it should get frustrating at some points but this game takes it to another level).

However, that gets overshadowed by how terrible the bugs are. This game has been out for like 2 years and these developers are spending more time on making skins and crates than fixing the damn game. This game started out INCLUDING KOTK and Just Survive with the goal of getting it to PC and PS4. First they split it up into two separate games (money grab?), then they say they're not concentrating on PS4 to make sure it works well on Windows? What a joke.On the days that you're not lagging on these terrible servers or getting random disconnects, you'll get other fun surprises like:- your gun not firing- your AK not reloading- your shotgun not hitting correctly- shooting straight and somehow hitting the ceiling- falling through the map- becoming a ghost in a car- random CTDs- plus many more!Dont worry though, their crate system that makes them money works perfectly.

76561198093707902,Recommended,433850,29025597,Posted: 4 January,all,ABD4EDE,"Alright everybody,This is my first review for any game on steam ever. With that said, this game either had to be darn good or just a steaming pile of **** to inspire me to finally write a review. One might ask, ""Well, which one is it?""(If you want the short answer, there will be a TL;DR at the bottom) Well, it's hard to say, really. I know I said that the game had to be either great or terrible to inspire me to write about it, but hear me out. The concept for H1Z1: KOTK isout of this world!Daybreak really did a great job making a simple, and almost mindless (Which is a good thing for me) game that is just plain fun. As someone who enjoys games that you can't beat (ex. COD: Zombies), or games that you can get really good at (ex. Super Smash Bros Melee), I'd wholeheartedly recommend this game to people who enjoy the same types of games that I do.However, if you enjoy games with any semblance of a story or even organization, then this game is not for you. Plain and simple.This is where the praise ends though... Oftentimes, I find myself frustrated with this game. Why? Trust me, it's not because I'm getting rekt. It's actually the treasure trove of bugs this game isplaguedwith. The devs really screwed the pooch here, folks. While some bugs are worse than others, I plan on talking about only one bug here today. I will call this bug the ""Standstill bug"". Where do I even start? This bug is the bane of my existence. Basically, when you're in a vehicle, there is a chance that your character will just up and get out. That's not the worst part though. When you get out YOU CAN'T MOVE. Also, you cannot shoot or even switch weapons. This is a real problem that ruins my experience with this game. Another more minor complaint of mine is the fact that there is no spectating or killcams. You just die and exit. Almost like the game is saying ""Hey, shoo!"". When I'm playing with friends, this would actually give me something to do, instead of hoping they die fast so you can join a game together again. This last complaint can be chalked up to nitpicking, but I'll share anyways. Many times when I'm in a long distance fight, I can never see my enemy! Call me a noob, but the fact that I die and dont even know what hit me has made me really grit my teeth more than that darn standstill bug. The binoculars SORT OF help, but even then... I still find it difficult to spot enemies. Yes, I turned up my render distance in case you're wondering.BUT, aside from these frustrating negatives, I DO recommend this game. After all, itisin early access. One thing you have to give the devs credit for is that if you told me that it was just a buggy game, I never would have known it was an early access game. If I had to rate this game, I would give it a 6/10. Just iron out the kinks and you'd have an amazing game. With the kinks... it's ""Good, I guess"".TL;DR: Good concept for a game, but it has it's fair share of glitches. 6/10 needs some new features and bug fixes, but aside from that I recommend it."

You will need to spend many hours developing your skill set before you can have a genuine fun time in this game.(Long version)My H1Z1: KotK review:My expirience with this game when i first picked it up back when the unfunny meme ""summits in the pit"" was just getting started, I found this game to be very difficult to get into. I was dying way to quick or I just wasnt able to kill anyone during a solid battle royal match. As time went on I started to watch people to study their movements and gameplay styles in the hope of becoming more knowledgable in the game. After around 90 hours (on the main H1Z1 before they split) i developed what i would call a ""decent skill set."" My point being; do not pick up this game if you are not ready to put countless hours into becoming a great player. There are no shortcuts and there is no room for bad players. Thank you."

Hmm so before I describe anything about this game, I just wanna let you know that I am no way a skilled player(pro) in this game (I suck its just that i am too embarrased to admit that). But as far as the review about the game goes on,This game is so freakin fun to play either you love being alone(solo), or get some help coz you suck ""like me""(duos), or go chaos with known/unknown peeps(fives).. This game got it all. And that pretty much sums everything I wanna say...P.S. You may run into some weird internet/server issues get so much lag to the point where you hate this game so much and the game itself may cause some ridiculous problems to even start.. But setaside those b.s. and enjoy, have fun playing this game for what it is.. Happy Gaming and Good Luck :)"
,Recommended,433850,29841619,Posted: 10 February,all,brandon,"NOTE: I haven't played this game in awhile but I will make an honest review about it.****INTRO****I purchased this game when H1Z1 was only H1Z1 before they split up and give KOTK portion to another development team. I would like to say this game came out around 2015 when it was H1Z1. I played KOTK since it released, trust me when I say the servers were as bad than they are now.****KOTK NOW****As of 2/11/2017 Daybreak just fixed the servers to where you load in faster than you did before which I have to admit was a great update. I am guessing some of these negative reviews are mainly because people rage. Very understandable and can relate to it a lot. Other than rage, it is probably because they have terrible PCs that can't run the game. Lets start off with the pros of H1Z1: KOTK.****PROS****I can run this game smoothly with of course some edited details. My PC specs are an i3 3.40GHz CPU, 16GB of DDR3 1600Mhz RAM, and a 2GB SC 960GTX GPU. Now of course I know I can run the game. So here are the pros. 1. The servers are better than they have ever been before compared to how it was yesterday and 2015. 2. Always add new stuff to the players every so month in crates. 3. Fun to play with friends in duos or fives and even in solo. 4. Good settings that you can adjust to your advantage to the game. 5. Change cross hair and color. 6. Environment is great and the graphics are great no matter what settings you have it at. Now lets get to the Cons.****CONS****There is a lot of things wrong with this game that are annoying. I would like to say that the community is somewhat of a con but really overall its about half con, which is basically saying that the community is toxic but coming from a person who plays with a toxic community you get used to it. 1. Glitches and bugs. I know that this game has been in Early Access for almost a year now, but one thing I would like them to fix at this time is, getting killed by the environment, or fall out of nowhere when you are on the ground instead. 2. THERE IS NO REPORT BUTTON ANYMORE LIKE THERE USED TO BE DAYBREAK ADD IT BACK ASAP. The fact that there is no report button is bad, my friends and I have been killed by hackers who head shot us from no where in sight, or even eating bullets from an AK or a shotgun with no armor, but can still kill us with just a round from a shotgun.****OVERALL****This game overall is a 8.6 out of a 10 rating. I highly recommend someone to buy this game as you guys can play duos. I think this game also has negative reviews is because of some players not being able to understand the function of KOTK. You have to be hungry for kills, thrive to win and show everyone you are the boss. You have to play aggressive no matter what. Some players don't seem to understand that."

The new update was HUGE and seemed to address a lot of outstanding issues with the game. Good to know the game is still being actively supported/updated. Easily one of the most difficult but most exciting shooters I've ever played. Hit registration seems to have improved greatly. Added NA servers is a big plus. Optimized pretty well and framerates are really good. Lots of customization options - Appearance, reticles, keybindings, etc...CONS:They have adopted the same microtransaction business model. All the cool skins for clothing, weapons, helmets, masks, etc.. is going to cost you $$$. It's a cancer in the gaming community.Not for beginner shooters.

This game is far from smooth and feels like it is still in Alpha. What makes me more amazed by this game is the limited gameplay.. The maps are excellent and feel fun to explore, but in the first minute of every game you will have most items in the game (execpt the sniper) and the exploration immediately dies.  Looking at other survival games like 7DTD, which has thousands of items, an amazing crafting system and much better (RANDOMLY GENERATED) maps, this game feels like a joke.

There is no purchasable content that gives players an advantage in-game other than camo that is typically earned from the free crates that you get from leveling up. Also, most of the purchasable content is more for flair and if anything gives a disadvantage at the cost of aesthetics. That being said, most of the uncommon skins are really cool but very rare if you don't purchase some crates.3) Bugs: I've seen huge improvement since I started playing and there's still bugs. But the game is beautiful and the best of it's kind IMO so it usually doesn't bother me.4) Updates/Graphics: They recently released an update that made my game barely playable to one of the smoothest PC games I've ever played. There are a few gamebreaking bugs that pop out maybe 1/50 games in my experience. In addition, the new map is very good and provides unique loot and challenges based on where you drop. The game itself is gorgeous even in medium settings.5) Gameplay: Weapons are very balanced and skill/knowledge dependant. Every weapon (excluding melee) can be useful if used correctly. Vehicles and loot are typically very easy to find, minus a few unlucky drops where you find a backpack and a helmet and the guy next door quickly hunts you down with an AK-47 or AR-15. Aiming isn't hard but because people are so good at the game, it can be challenging to kill enemies before they kill you. Killing enemies always feels rewarding. Solo, duo, and fives are all very fun and unique. I just wish there was a 3-man mode because playing in a group of 4 in fives is doable but 3-manning in fives requires a huge level of effort for a small chance of making it out of your first 1-2 enemy encounters.6) Community: Nearly all of the H1Z1 streamers are a huge pleasure to watch. The general community is equal parts hilarious, troll, and competitive. If you think someone if BM, just laugh with them and 9 times out of 10 they'll open up and actually be very friendly. That being said, proxy chat is a blessing as much as it is cancer as ♥♥♥♥.10/10 would spend $20 on KotK"

Both games are where 100-174 people are dropped into a large map to fight to the death as some sort of threat (toxic gas in h1z1 or a blue border that you take damage from in PUBG) is pushing players closer together to a certain point where they are guaranteed to see each other.H1Z1 pros:Sound is goodWild masks and clothes that make it funA fun lobby while waiting for game to startRounds are quick and fast pacedThe parachutes go down faster than PUBGH1Z1 cons:Crashes every time I play it.Not many vehiclesNot a huge variety of weapons.You can't add scopes to guns (you can in PUBG)Navigation in game is hard.

76561198105370831,Not Recommended,433850,33472193,Posted: 11 July,all,Bloodlust,First of all I have to say this game is very addicting and enjoyable when you learn how to play. The bad part of this game and the reason I do not recommend is that whether you queue for solo/duos/fives there will always be royalties in that match (highest rank in game). For instance like me and my friends we all bought the game when it was on sale and played fives and lost every game to people who are literal pros at the game and have thousands of hours on it. On top of that the weapons in this game have major bug issues where you will somtimes kill someone with a shotgun 1 shot '1 pump' and other times it will take multiple when you shoot the target at the same spot. The gun mechanics dont make any sense and arent taught to you at all. I think that until they come out with a queue filter so that you play against people at the same rank/skill as you this game will be unplayable for new people... By the way this game is dieing at an alarming rate especially due to the growth of PUBG. If you want a fast paced game with a lot of bugs/utter chaos/unfairness get this game. that pretty much covers it.

If you're apart of the /kotk reddit then you should know that the devs actually listen to people, yes, they make mistakes, but they listen and observe what people say and try and implement it into the game.You can't moan about the game being 'bad' because you got killed once or twice, it happens, get over it, join another game and try again like everyone else has to do."

76561198136567421,Recommended,433850,25893136,"Posted: 6 October, 2016",all,jimmy bandit,This game is very fun. I do not understand what the people who talk crap about this game in the 12 hours I have played this game I have not run into any hackers but have had a fun enjoyable experience. the only thing I do not like is the chances of spawning right next to someone and getting killed within the first 2 minutes of the match starting.
,Recommended,433850,30097439,Posted: 22 February,all,JTK,"H1Z1 King of the Kill, this is a great game to play as a team. Now, I have over 1 entire day on this game so this review is quite trustworthy. Like I said, fun to play with friends, I say this because there is literally no skill based matchmaking which gives new players no chance to win. Wheras in duos or fives you have teamates to rely on if you get in a gunfight. I also prefer to play as a team becasue solo is purely boring! The highest place I have got in solo is 4th, and that is beacsue I sat in a caravan for 30 minutes until I was a final survivor. I recommend this game to people that like having a stratagie because if you just run around in an open field you will most likely die. Another bad point is the crate thing. It is a lot like the Counter-Strike system, you get a crate from playing and you pay money to open it. These cases only contain cosmetic items that cannot be marketed. In order to open a crate you have to buy crowns, crates cost 200 crowns to open and you can buy 400 crowns for £4.00. So opening a crate costs about £2. However, you can recieve some crates in game which are already unlocked. I myself have gotten a few of these and from one of them I got a lightning AR-15 camo which is pretty rare and is worth about £30, I traded it in for scrap which you can use to get new items. Scrapping is a pretty simple process: get scrap from unwanted cosmetics, go into the scrap yard and trade in 100 scrap for a new item and that's it really. Although it has flaws, H1Z1 really isn't a bad game. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Battle Royals and is quite strategic.Star rating: 3.5/5This is because of the lack of skill based matchmaking and the fact that is a boring game to play solo."

I only bought the game to play with my friends and boy was that a mistake. Grant it, it was fun playing with friends when we would survive for a while and get to the top 20, but goodness is this game glitchy and lacking on content (NOT crates or skins, there a plenty of those to waste your money on). There are only 3 useful guns in a firefight after the first 5 minutes and even then firefights are a load of garbage as it comes down to who has better latency. FPS is an issue but can be worked around and the pacing is very fast and intense but can be annoying. Overall, H1Z1: King of the Kill needs more work and updates on about everything in the game, PlayerUnknowns BattleGrounds is a far superior battle royale compaired to H1Z1: KOTK."

They have done alot of improvement for Training mode. They have let the Ammo, and Weapons respawn ALOT quicker than it use to be. So do some training before you do Solo, Duoes, and FIves. If your not playing with anyone, do Training. There you will auto respawn, instead of waiting for like 15 minutes, before you even launch in a game. And, my personal opion between Just Surive, the aim is closely the same. So if you do alot of KOTK, and then switch to Just Surivie, you will notice an improvement in your reaction time, along with you aiming as well. Aslong you try to keep your same setting nearly the same."

It was fun and seemed quite stable without no major issues. However that was the first time i played it. When I jumped into my 5th or maybe 6th match I got stuck in the loading screen. This game is really unstable, once my parachute did not open and I could walk in the air, loading screens that freeze happens every other game.This game may be fun to play both alone and with friends but why would you buy an unstable game that is losing players to better battle royale game, Player Unknowns Battlegrounds. I don’t see the point of buying H1Z1 anymore since you now can buy PUBG for only 10€ more. I don’t own PUBG myself but I have watched a few streams and read some reviews of the game and it seems to already be on H1Z1 level after the few months that it has been out on the steam store.Final WordH1Z1 is a really fun game when it is working especially with friends. But it there are many times when it is not really working. I can’t really see why anyone would buy this over PUBG. And if you only have 20€ to spend buy another game or buy something else. I would give this game a 5/10 and I would not recommend this game.Graphics (for the time) 6/10Story -Gameplay Mechanics 7/10"

Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor.Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together.Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!"

I have recently bought Player Unknown Battlegrounds and I have to say you're gonna have a hard time convincing me to play this game again. PUBG has 10x the amount of content that h1z1 has with many differant sights, chokes, grips, quick draw, having the choice to where you want to go anywhere on the map unlike h1 and the graphics are 20x better (if you have the computer to run it). I had also played h1z1 for 20 hours and barely cracked the top 10 once (which was me hiding pretty much the entire game) and with PUBG I have made the top 10 twice as a solo and about 5 times with a group of my friends with 2 chicken dinners (which is getting 1st if you're not familiar). If you are looking between h1z1 and this game 100% get this game. If you don't have the money for PUBG and you do for this don't even bother you will regret it as I have."

Unless you die of course.The map is quite large, a lot of towns, forests and even some villages. You can shorten your way by using a vehicle, if you're lucky and find one or steal someones car you cheeky bastar*.You can even play in third person, craft things that will help you to survive, find weapons that are melee or bows, crossbows and firearms.You'll enjoy the game with decent graphics.IMO - I find playing solo rather boring than fun, so I usually play with my mates.The game will be increased in price when it releases so If you want to play this game but don't want to pay extra you should get it now until it's late.TL:DRGet PUBG, it's more worth it if you want BR with ARMA aspects.Get KOTK, if you want to play arcade style with lazy mechanics."

It's fun with friends but so is kicking turds. Single player gameplay involves one of the two following scenarios.0. Wait in queue. These are admittedly fast.1. You spawn someplace safe and manage to get some gear to defend yourself.1a. You die anyway.1b. You survive, and proceed to the walking simulator section of the game where you either survive for a while and get some lucky kills, or your opponent gets lucky and kills you.2a. You die right off the bat because you had the bad luck of spawning with half the battle royal and weren't able to get a weapon fast enough.2b. See 1b.This is the only section of the game where you are rewarded because - for some reason - most casual ♥♥♥♥wits who ""play"" video games in the age of incompetence cannot into teamplay much less be good at it and the devs know that. And oh by the way the rewards suck.Moving onto the only section of the game worth playing (reminder: you're not rewarded here,) teamplay can result in some heavy drawn-out battles between opposing teams which is both tactical and realistic. These are usually cut short by the fact that you must flee to a safe zone every 5 or 10 minutes. I forget which. The appeal here is - again - cut short by poor hit detection and the fact that every hit is devestating. In other words: whoever is luckiest wins.Regardless the overall chaotic nature of a team battle royal is tense (some may say too tense) but fun. If you have a friend or four I'd recommend it. The twenty dollar price tag is worth it. Otherwise there are many, many, many, many, MANY better single player games out there that I could fully recommend as a more rewarding experience in every imaginable way."

The old h1z1 map, that all people cursed as it was very bad, with full of bugs and glitches + the almighty shotgun with its random delays and not to forget the very bad server hit registration.Even after all that there comes the so called ""h1z2"" map or the 2nd map and it was directly forced into the game for everyone removing the old map (which was the most stupid decision ever). Now the old audience would beg to get the old map just because the new map is much more unfinished and very poorly optimized with even worse servers and with many more bugs. Thanks daybreak for making your loyal old audience smaller and not optimising the game or fixing the damn shotgun with its delay and ofcourse the poorly maintained servers and not adding any decent servers in South asia.Sure keep creating crates and keep bagging money from the poor gamers by heavy advertizing the game through twitch as this is the only aim for this game now and for the future aswell.From being the best concept of 2015 to being the worst executed game of 2016. It feels like the game is still in the Alpha phase.Nevermind, Daybreak wont even consider any review. I am just a small consumer of their game just like everybody else.

Aiming was buggy, Shotguns were too OP, and cities seemed over crowded with spawns. With the combat update it went from trash to more enjoyable than PUBG in my opinion. I havent touched pubg since. Hope to see more types of weapons, cars, and gear in the future. Maybe even an option to play in a handgun only server?Anyways this games alot of fun."
,Recommended,433850,34826472,Posted: 8 September,all,★CreaseOfLow/YT★,"Okay, now this wont be one of my reviews that are just a couple words saying its good or bad,But if you want to know the simple answer of it, Its good AND bad.You start in the main lobby, you have lots of options and graphics to setup to your liking, FOV, Crosshair ETCYou can get skins for clothing and guns, while guns are more rare.You click play, you see multiple modes, Solos, Duos, Fives, Skirmish and training.Heres a breif explanation of all of them.Solos - Basically as the game says, you play solo, you start in a parachute and drop down to areas containing loot, Areas such as, Suburbs, Towns, Trailer parks and cities. Theres more than 100 people and you have to kill them. When you're last alive you win.Duos - You play with your friends.If you dont have any :( you can find a player also searching.If you don't like that either you can do a more challenging approach (i wouldn't suggest this for the newer players)you can do solos in duos, Basically yourself vs teams of 2.Theres more people to kill but you can get sandwiched easily.Hence the challenge part.Fives - You can play any amount of people 5 and below, same as solos and duos, you can find people to play with, or play solo fives which is extremly hard.I played this game back when it just broke apart from Just Survive, The updates have been (for the most part) a step up,Now lets talk about the combat update, this is the bad part.While the movement is smoother and more enjoyable, The AR-15 has almost no bullet drop.The Hellfire is useless, it was good in the pre-release and it turned to absolute garbage,Its like trying to fire a LMG with one hand, (your non domanant one).Other than that though.All in all, this game is very fun and i plan to put countless hours into it.Thank you for reading :)"

Theres no actual practicing gun fights without air dropping in and wasting lots of time getting guns ammo only to find out that you made no progress in the gun game aspect. If you hit somebody with car they should die or get knocked down/stunned. if a car is moving and you jump out of it you should roll and be stunned. watching people go full speed jump of a car the instantly shoot and kill someone..... How is there tournaments for this game when it doesn't have basic animations. Seem like the big focus is to get people do buy in store/game content. there is allot of continuous game drop and errors my gosh i spent the first 5 games played i was disconnected or booted saying i was cheating, i have only killed 2 or 3 people in over 20 completed games. Playing on a $7xxx computer with fiber line internet 1TB i know its not on my end. I read other reviews dating back weeks and seems like they haven't addressed allot of issues.

And there is no scarcity at all with these guns exluding the rifle meaning anybody and everybody has these so if you are unlucky enough to have anything else you are bone zoned. Also this games aming system is complete bonkers you can aim directly at someone 10 feet away from you and fire and still miss even in 1st person, all everyone ever does in this game is use aimbot or spam shooting. Healthpacks are useless if you find them in bulk(which happens alot) because you die so easy in this game that healing is next to usless especially since you bleed out faster than you can use the damn things. The real way to play this game is to hide in the safe zone until everybody kills eachother and pray to god you dont get found. Grenades and molitovs do no damage even with no bodyarmor. You can instantly get in and out of cars to insta pop straggalers and that my friend is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Also the guns in this game dont make any sence at all there are no hunting rifles. and there is only 1 type of shotgun yet there are assault rifles and pistols everywhere you look. The servers are down alot and glitch out too often.

In a battle royale game where you can shoot people in the head four times with a sniper and still not kill them, go flying and spinning upside down in a parachute whenever you touch any surface other than the ground, or go into a building with no loot while another dude drops down and gets all the weapons and armor he needs to come over and tap you once in the head, I think it is absolutely amazing and is qualified to be programmed on tv for major tournaments. An amazing little thing added to the update system for the game is whenever there is an update and they say that it is going to be four-six hours, they really mean eight to twelve. If you plan on doing a few games today, you should probably just do something else. Ive been playing the game a lot recently, and I've made it to Diamond 2 with 6 wins. Now I am 100% certain that I'm not the best player in the game and I am also 100% sure that i'm not the worst player in the game, but I understand when a game is bad. I understand that these developers are trying to do their jobs as best as they can, but this game isn't the best that it can be.

I know it's unfair to compare this game to PUBG, but they're both inventions of PlayerUnknown aka Brendan, and they're both major Battle Royale shooters. Would I recommend this game? It depends on the audience. If you're a big COD or other arcade fps player (battlefield is borderline arcade/warsim so either), I would recommend this game. HOWEVER, if you're a big Rainbow Six player or something alike (Squad, ARMA, etc) I would definitely recommend PUBG over this. I personally don't enjoy this game very much, but I know heaps of people do so that's why I wanted to write a review to let people who do or do not like it or people who haven't tried it know my opinion on this BR shooter. To sum it up, buy this if you're an arcade FPS player (COD, Overwatch, etc), buy PUBG if you're a tactical FPS player (Rainbow Six, ARMA, etc)."

The aim of the game is to survive the longest.The graphics are decent looking but not the best, however this will be a minor factor when it comes to core gameplay and experiences.This is an entertaining game, some matches you join will only last for a few minutes due to an early death or can last over 30 minutes if you manage to survive for long enough.You are able to play with friends as there are modes that allow this aspect of the game, such as the duo mode and the five man mode.The game is worth it's $20 (US) pricetag, and remember if you don't enjoy the game you can refund it."

,Not Recommended,433850,28927211,Posted: 1 January,all,Caboose,"I like this game and it's concept, however its blatantly obvious that the developers do not care about their consumers. Just look at the Reddit pages! They do Q&A's where they dodge any questions involving improving the game mechanics, server issues, D-Sync, etc. They really only seem to care about money, and it's becoming more apparent as they are pushing a game that’s still in its Alpha stage after 2+ years into eSports. They refuse to even add an instant ""Requeue"" button that most of the community has practially begged for so that, after they die to either a fair fight or a Chinese player thats lagging, you can try to get back in. But what do they do? Nothing of course.The only reasons I would recommend this game are:1) Playing with a group of friends, the game is still kinda fun then2) If you like being shot when you either:a) can't pick up a gunb) picked up a gun, but it didnt reload cause of a bug that has yet to be patchedc) you picked up the shot gun and fire blanks (which happens frequently)d) you cant get you gun up to aim over cover that really isnt in the waye) ????? ( best way to describe some of the random ways you die, like your parachutes)3) You've played enough CS:GO that you now speak fluent Russian, and are now looking to learn a new one. Hope you're interested in Mandarin, cause all of the Chinese players are coming here because they get a D-Sync advantage against players. ( they move faster on their screen than on yours. I.E. You aim at there head, but youre actually aiming about 10 feet from where they actually are)I geniunely don't understand how they keep making this game worse with every new patch and update. It's baffling. If you dont believe me, check out the King of the Kill subreddit (r/kotk) and check out some of the videos that show how brutally unfair and bugged this game is."

Put your money towards pubg or cod if youre interested in this, they at least have devs that listen to the community or have a general idea of what theyre doing, These devs have had the same bugs in their games since 2015 one being the god awful hit registration that rarely ever registers correctly, for the last few years most if not all patch notes have included something saying ""fixed/improved bullet registration"" but nothing has changed.

You, quite literally, cannot even go ONE match without running into cheaters. It's really too bad, becuase otherwise it'd, at least, have the potential to be a decent enough game. Not that the cheating is the only downside. Besides being rampant cheating, it's also graphically unimpressive, controls aren't nearly as responsive as they should be for a PC shooter, and the game seems to just decide whether you get (or succumb to) a headshot with a complete lack of disregard as to where the shot actually landed.  It's just playable enough to have a little fun with if you aren't competitive, but seriously DO NOT BUY if you're actually looking for a competitive shooter. Well.. Really, don't buy anyway. Maybe if it's on sale for super cheat, but anything more than, say, a $1.50 is a blatant rip off. You can have the same quality (and often much better quality) from free indie games."

,Recommended,433850,26978356,"Posted: 23 November, 2016",all,Yovalord,"Im going to start this off with the cons, because there are a lot of them, however the game is fun if you can look past them for the most part.Cons:-The game is buggy, there will be items that you cannot grab without going to the inventory menu and dragging through proximity.  You will randomly fall through the map and lose.  You will randomly teleport 15 feet from where you were standing and end up outside of the building you were trying to hide in.-The game is balanced mostly upon 3 main weapons, maybe 4 if you count the revolver as a utility weapon for killing vehicles.  The AK47, AR15, and Shotgun are typically the only guns worth picking up and its questionable at this point why the other weapons even exist.  All guns seem to have the same rarity (with the exception of the crossbow which honestly isnt even a viable weapon so i am not sure why it is more elusive) so its rare that the weapons you want aren't going to be available to you with a little bit of searching, which isnt a bad thing however it is bad that only 3 of many gun choices are viable.  All grenades are fine except for the stun grenade, why does it exist lol.  Also, melee weapons should be 1-3 hit kills, also useless.- While the game has great dress up options, its very tough to look good without throwing an extra lump sum of money into the game.  Crates/keys pretty much.- Hacking exists and sometimes the game will seem really unfair.  Its not somthing you will see 100% of your games but its hard to tell when somebody is really good and when somebody is hacking some of the time.- Servers are all screwed up, everybody plays on the EU or NA servers.  Australian servers are dead, NA servers have more chinese players on them than english speakers.Pros:- Despite all of the negatives above, the game is fun, intense, and gets your heart beating.  There is a LOT of room for improvment and i am optimistic that the devs will make those improvments.- The game is pretty cheap- The community is pure cancer, probably in the good way, no other games bring the h1z1 lobby experiance.My conclusion is, the game is worth it if you can look at a 15-20$ game and not nitpick about every thing that is wrong with it.  This game wont be fun for somebody who feels they should be playing a AAA title game and any bugs that exist are making the game ""Litterally unplayable""."

Not my kind of fun.

When looking at my played hours you will notice that I have just 12 as of writing this review and this is due to what I have just mentioned. I will say it once again in order to further solidify my opinion. This game is broken.After getting that off my chest I will now explain why I have such a harsh view on this piece of trash.The game has been made by unskilled, money hungry, lazy, ignorant and to be frank a pathetic excuse for developers. Glitches in the game have been around so long that they are known by players who have to make an effort to try and avoid them. Every time I load the game I delete and recreate my character in order to dodge the infamous running man glitch that leaves you waiting for all eternity for the main menu to appear. Whenever i see a shotgun, my first thought is to not pick it up due to the extremely poorly made hit boxes and low damage that they seem to have. And yet instead of fixing these issues combined with the ridiculously low framerate for a game of its quality, the developers decide to do money making promotions and add new skins in order to drain the community dry of their cash.With my rig I get better fps in GTA V with high settings enabled than i do in this game. (It's♥♥♥♥♥♥To be honest i would write more but I can't be bothered and this game isn't worth my or your time. If you choose to do so you can take my word for it.

Needs a better developer team to advance as Daybreak dont give 2 sh*ts.Edit : I've just come back to say how disappointed I am with Daybreak and their decisions with what to do with their game. Over the last 3 months, they have completly ignored any feedback from Pros, Long Time Players, and the average player base in general and mainly focused on making the game easier to play, while also trying to compete with PUBG at the same time.This created the Combat Update, the single worst update I think I have ever seen in a popular game OTHER THAN the 'Meet your Match' update for TF2. It completly changed the combat mechanics of the original game and promised fair recoil compensation, improved hit reg, and an overall better feel for the game. While the update provided some new aspects of the game, it did none of what was promised.All weapons had bloom recoil, which meant the 'circle of affect' would expand after shooting a couple of bullets, meaning the bullets would just fling anywhere.Movement is complete trash. ENAS is extremely overpowered in close range combat and it was fine the way it was.Hit Reg is almost as worse as ever, showing lots of  'oddshots' where players are shooting straight on a player and getting no damage markers.There are countless other issues wrong with the new update (which I will not go into detail about), but the worst part is is Daybreaks complete ignorance towards any sort of useful improvements. So far their most recent updates have been making it easier to join servers and other features :(.From someone who has around 600 hours on the game, It's genuinely sad to see what this game has become, and I know I'm not the only one. THUMP has already cried twice on stream about the state of the game.If you are looking to buy a new game,LOOK ELSEWHEREPUBG is blowing up right now if you are up for that but seriously dont waste your money."

For example-- H1Z1 KOTK is fast-paced, smashmouth and in your face. There isn't much time to plan, as soon as you drop in its fight or flight. The only difference between life or restarting anew is how fast you can move your fingers under high pressure situations.Lastly, don't let PUBG-heads discourage you. There is still plenty of life left in H1Z1 KOTK. Grab some brews; grab some friends, jump in a Discord and spend hours in gunning down the enemy while shout out profanities. Its what gaming is all about, right?"

,Recommended,433850,33230810,Posted: 4 July,all,draxx,"I think Battle Royale games should be reviewed under titles so I won't make a ""Good Ways-Bad Ways"" review.Looting:It's in the simplest way. You get a gun, manage its slot, load it, and join fights (Thing I'm trying to say here is that you can't modify your gun or anything. There isn't stuff like extended clips, scopes, red dots etc.).Loot Balancement:It's nicely balanced around the map if you don't mind some expections. Like the hospital. It's just a huge building itself and yes, it'll take some time to loot it all but if you even loot half of it, and if you're a little lucky, you'll have an AR-15 with around 160 ammo, an AK with same ammo, a shotgun with 60 ammo, a motorbike helmet, maybe an armor and lots of grenades. Except these some places, loot is pretty well-balanced.Guns:Uh, there isn't a lot. There are like 10 guns or so. AK-47, AR-15, Hellfire (Literally just a Mini-Uzi), Sniper that I don't remember the name of, unnecessary pistols, Magnum, Shotgun, Crossbow with a scope and regular bow. These are enough to kill ppl of course but if there were more guns like there are in PUBG, it'd be kinda better.Map:It isn't the best, especially for sniping, but it's good enough with a big size.Mechanics:They're simple but very nice. Might take a little while to get used to, but if you played TPS or FPS games before, it will take less than an hour.Physics:They're realistic enough for a Battle Royale game. There are glitches sometimes but Daybreak still improved the physics a lot from the start.Animations:Running animations weren't cool before but they were changed A LOT with the last Combat Update and now are way more realistic. So they're good enough. Other animations like parachuting anims. and stuff weren't changed much from the start and still nice.Interface:Not much to talk about. It's simple and pretty useful.Fairness:Fairness is an important thing in Battle Royale since it's full of competitiveness and if a game is competitive, it has to be fair. H1Z1 is not fair at all because of one thing. And that's the landing. Everyone is left RANDOMLY on the map so you can't really choose where to go. Best way to fix that will be having the same system as PUBG, where everyone is in a plane and you jump out whenever and wherever you want to. But this is the only fairness problem. It's fair except for this.If you can afford it and your computer can handle it, just buy PUBG. This went down to an ""alternative"" position when PUBG came out.8/10"

BUT, it's still ""glitchy"" and  you will be playing with foreigners on the others side of the planet (read: asians) because they let players choose which region they want to play in (i hear the asian servers suck, but don't know the actual reason they play on north american servers). until they enact a region lock, it is a moderate problem. it takes one to two shots to kill. considering that, and the fact that you can bet in game skulls (puchasable, or earned) on matches, dying to the ""china number one"" crowd as they blink around in front of you is frustrating sometimes. espescially when you also have to reload into a new match (which is now mercifully much shorter (about a minute or two)) still, i HIGHLY recommend this game, but this NEEDS region lock in my opinion. at least until they invent commercial super-conductors. hopefully they fix all foreign servers and reduce international players jumping their ship en masse.i will still be playing anyway, but i'll be hiding from the asians in a bush until they pass."

PUBG comes out and I wasn't a fan and I was playing H1Z1 as much as I could you know but then I stopped and played other games. I played it today (17th August 2017) and I was very dissapointed I spawned in the middle of the game with 50 people left so I only had a couple mins probaly not thatbut anyway I went to get loot and you know I was on the edge of the gas and honestly I couldn't carry alot, the gas starts to make its way towards me and so I run and I get caught up with me instantly but I had Tactical medkits to keep me going but it wasn't enough. as I got out of the zone I saw 2 cars and it made me think to win you need a car and alot of time on your hands, As I approached the tree I attacked the enemy not knowing if I was hittin g him because I couldn't see him because of my shoulder and the terrible crosshair and then all of a sudden I got launched across the map becayse of a guy in the police car.I played another game and spawned in at the start and I got my loot and everything but the thing is there is no cars whatsoever so as I'm running round trying to find a car I give up hope and start running and once again the gas caught up with me in seconds but I somehow escaped and saw another enemy so I attacked him and again I couldn't see wjat I was shooting so after he killed me I gave up and wrote this review.December Rating 9/10August Rating 2.5/10"

That said, that little bit of time you do wait you really are kicking yourself in the head trying to figure out why you've stuck out another round.I got this game to play in a group and to be quite fair there are so many better games that I wish I hadn't wasted my $20 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dollars on this worthless title.

Crowns are expensive also, some glitches (but many less than before), need more guns and vehicles, maybe another map.One problem i am having now is that when i hit the ""get crowns"" button in the game, it crashes.

,Recommended,433850,34597399,Posted: 29 August,all,Roo,"Would honestly just like to write a small review without comparing it to PUBG. I've played H1Z1 since release and the battle royale mode for it is a world's different from what it used to be. Action feels fluid and exciting, the gunplay to me is quite fun.KotK is fast-paced. Hit-reg, like most shooters now, can be a little dodgy sometimes especially with shotguns. That said, it works pretty much all the time with rifles and they're the staple of combat in this game. Getting kills feels satisfying, especially two-tapping with an assault rifle (headshotting the helmet then the head).There is a region lock, so you probably won't be able to play with friends in different countries unless they find a working VPN.The best way to get skins is just buying them off Opskins, and for the most part they're all affordable.Might update this if I think of more points to make, but right now I think the game is worth $20 USD. Even if it is rage-inducing sometimes to someone who normally doesn't rage much at all."

Great to play with a group of friends or solo.Only a couple of negatives that I can find with the game at its current state:- The strategy of hopping out of a car and instantly shooting someone is gamebreaking (There is no animation for exiting cars and the player exits the car with the last weapon they were using in their hands)- Some of the servers (particularly Asia) and the game itself seem to be very unstable when in loading screens. I have come across many instances where myself or my friends crash to desktop while attempting to launch the game, while attemping to join the pre-game lobby and also when loading the main menu after a game.I am sure that in the future these issues will be adressed as they are the only faults in an otherwise amazing game."

,Recommended,433850,28461868,"Posted: 18 December, 2016",all,Elegen,"Got this game when it was on sale for $10 and I am quite pleased with the purchase. I'd say it's definitely worth the full price of $20. Its a lot of fun and if you have a friend or friends to play duo's or fives with its even better. Great replay value.I see onmly 2 downsides to the game so far. The first is the training system as it currently is, isn't that great. It's like a normal game minus the gas waves and you can respawn. It gives you tool tips as you do things but when I played it, the items were few and far between compared to a normal game. I assume they dont respawn or do so very rarely. Anyways they can definitely improve it still.  The second is in how they have cosmetics setup. And since this is early access it could change so take this with a grain of salt. I feel the price for the crates is on the higher end. But thats subjective and you might not feel the same. I wouldn't have much of a problem with it if you could get unlocked crates by playing the game and placing in the top 3 or so. But as it is, you only have a chance to get locked crates, and then you have to spend real money to unlock them. The only way to get unlocked crates for free is by leveling your account and thats only once every 5 levels. And I assume it takes more exp per level as you get higher(maybe it caps per level at some point) but I couldn't find any info on it after some googling. Maybe I've been spoiled with Overwatch but I feel that how they have this setup currently isn't that fair to those who play well. And again this is just a minor annoyance. I hope they will change things up, but if they don't that's fine since its just cosmetics."

Alt+Tabbing during loading will break your game or takes along time.Besides the bad optimizations, the gameplay is boring. It's either spawn and get shot or spawn and find nobody. Then go back to the long load screen. The game also looks like it was made by someone who just learned how to 3D model objects. They spent more time on microtransactions than adding balanced guns. Seriously there is an AK-47 an AR-15 a shotgun, a sniper, and useless pistols. Wow, way to add the bear minimum unimaginative FPS guns. Nothing new here."

,Recommended,433850,32906092,Posted: 27 June,all,Exquisite.,"I bought H1Z1 on the Summer sale when it was and still is for the moment $10 and this game is a bunch of fun, most of the main bugs and problems people had with the game have been fixed and overall this game has been only fun for me. i am♥♥♥♥♥♥at it as i just started playing and it is very hard to get into just because of the amount of pro players that hit the ground 1 second before you and destroy you. This game has a steep learning curve and is hard to get the hang of but this is a fun refreshing game for someone like me who played way to much csgo. I think for $10 i would much rather buy this game again over going out and seeing a movie. This game is frantic, Fast paced and thrilling to say the least and even when you get wrecked by a good player it will always leave you wanting more. Since the updates this game is actually pretty well optomized and will run ok on older/lower budget machines. There is some things i'd want fixed still.-sometimes when i go into trailers or enclosed spaces it wont register me trying to pick up loot and this is real problem since the whole point of the game is to gear up and get ready as quick as possible.-for newer players i think there should be a better training map instead of being lazy and letting everyone roam for hours in the whole map looking for players to VS.-some gun mechanics need fixing-some driving mechanics alsoApart from this i look at this game very possitively and if you have a friend that owns this game also ask them to pair up and play duos (you wont regret it)."

It is challenging to win which is a feature I enjoy a lot.I applaud the Daybreak for coming up with such a wonderful game, however, the game has been out for over a year and we haven't seen too much change.

Most of the negative reviews talk about how the community is or how they get killed. Don't listen to them. If you want a challenging and fun game, just buy it. It's not that expensive.Are these people wrong?No. The community is pretty toxic, but the developers can't really help that. Sure they'll ban you for racial slurs or whatever but the community doesn't affect the gameplay. Just mute the chat and you'll be fine. THE GAME IS CHALLENGING. You can not play and expect to be really good within 10 hours of gameplay. It takes practice. The more you play, the better you'll get.Does Daybreak care about this game?Absolutely. They're constantly pushing out updates that for the most part improve the game. The ones whining about the updates can't adapt to them. Sure, there may be some tweaks needed which believe me, those tweaks come shortly after the big updates. The game still has a lot that is being changed and added, so don't cry when you see a bug. It happens.Just buy it if you're considering it. I remember being scared of wasting $20 because of all the negative reviews back when I got it and I don't regret buying it at all. I got exactly what I wanted when I bought it other than a few bugs here and there. PUBG is getting more negative reviews than this game as of now. This game is much more fast paced and action-packed compared to PUBG. It's fun, just try it."

The amount of glitches you'll find in this game is beyond reasonable. In every match you're not only fighting other people - you're fighting the game and it gets frustrating very quickly. What is even more demoralizing is that the developers don't seem to have any idea about what they should prioritize in the development process. The changes they implement (even the larger ones, like The Combat Update) are so insifnificant in the large scheme of things that it's just sad.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

I actually really liked it a couple months back when it was just H1Z1, and not split into two games. But at this point, I can't even remotely recommend this game to anyone at all. It's not in the stage where it's so bad it's funny, and it's not in a good state. It's just plain bad. The graphics and optimization of the game somehow got worse as development continued, which I have absolutely no clue how the developers managed that. The game runs at barely 20 FPS on my rig, which mind you my rig can run most if not all next gen games. H1Z1 King of the Kill and Just Survive are both just horrible excuses for games, and no one should buy both seperately at this price.Pros:-Could connect to servers with ease-Decent playerbaseCons:-Hitboxes/gunplay is unpredictable, sometimes you can kill someone with one shot, sometimes it takes a clip or two.-The game runs worse than my paraplegic grandfather-Graphics are worse than most games with half the budget-Developers don't care about the fanbase nor the game-They're selling this unbroken game as two seperate games for 20$ too much-Very frequently drop dead with literally no explanation at all-Waste of time-Waste of space-Proof that God is dead and we are aloneOverall rating: 2/10 please don't bother"

This game is fun by yourself and even more fun with friends. This game is in early access and can be buggy at times. The servers also have room for improvement. This hardly affects game.Pros:- Good value- Very fun and tense gameplay- Decent amount of guns- Kills are rewarding- Fun with friends- Large scale maps and servers- Balanced gun play- Decent graphics- Fast and easy matchmakingCons:- Bugs need fixing (some rare bugs are game breaking)- Servers/netcode could be improved- Players are hardly rewarded for winning games. When playing by yourself you recieve a decent amount of xp and there is a ranking system. But players only recieve a small amount of XP when playing with friends- Game has optimization issues- At the start of every game you spawn in the air with a parachute. The mechanics for parachuting are not great and can cause you to not get to the ground as fast as other players for unfair reasons- Players who load first get a head start towards the groundConclusion:Even with occasional bugs and laggy servers these hardly affect the amazing and fun gameplay, H1Z1 is very fun and addicting and I would recommend this game."

A game is not worth playing if you are relieved not to experience a glitch or bug after playing one round of multiplayer.That is what H1Z1 is, one glitch after another. Dont get me wrong, I have enjoyed playing the game since buying it and believe that the concept is amazing but the fact is that after experiencing a glitch in 2 of every 3 matches (that forces me to stop playing) has caused me to write this negative review.The amount of times that I have experienced the ""car bug"" (what I am now calling it) is unbelievable and plain pathetic. What this bug does is extreemly frustrating as it kicks you out of the car but locks you in the position that you were kicked out, preventing you from moving and forcing you to quit the game. Its sad because now I'm actually scared to get into a car as I have a fear of getting this bug again (which has happened to me in 2 out of 3 games that I play).The game is an amazing concept, the combat requires skill and the game can give you an amazing time to be had with friends (all the things i like in a game) but in the end the game just frustrates me and causes me to have a miserable time, this is why I cannot recommend the game."

The first game i got into had one 5 minute loading screen which had me load into the parachute phase, which doesnt even make sense as there's supposed to be a waiting area, my screen resolution was ♥♥♥♥ed up at this time as i randomly switched from black bar to not being able to see half the game, when i pressed escape to fix it, my screen froze..

Mound the flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat the teaspoon of olive oil, 2 eggs, and water in a bowl. Pour half the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing the egg with the flour with one hand; use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add the remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.2. Knead the dough until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes; add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form the dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.3. While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling. Combine the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, egg, and parsley and mix well. Set the filling aside.4. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one minute. Pour in the heavy cream, raise the heat to high, and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the Parmesan cheese and stir until the cheese melts. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.5. Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, warm the marinara sauce over medium-low heat.6. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash.7. Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets no thicker than a nickel. To assemble the ravioli, brush the egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop the filling mixture on the dough by teaspoonfuls about one inch apart. Cover the filling with the top sheet of pasta, pressing out the air from around each portion of filling. Press firmly around the filling to seal. Cut into individual ravioli with a knife or pizza cutter. Seal the edges.8. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the ravioli, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot, 4 to 8 minutes. Drain well.9. Grease a baking sheet. Place the cooked ravioli on the sheet pan and bake in the preheated oven until brown, about 4 minutes.10. To serve the ravioli, divide them among four warmed serving bowls. Drizzle the marinara sauce over the ravioli and then top with the cream sauce."

So everything you need in aBattle Royal game. Its stil in beta tho and there are alot of bugs like faling trough the ground yourcar randomly exploding and alot more. They are working on it and the game is getting better.That its in beta does not make it bad caus normaly nothing happens. Behind the game there is a fantasticcommunity. In the game there are alot of skins and a trading community. The price of skins could go upto thousands of dollars. And if you like trading or collecting you would like it. H1Z1 also has a E - Sportand tournements like the royolty showdown. Its a competetive game and there are ranks starting frombroze to royalty it resets at the start of every preseason. So you always have something to work to.And thats why I like H1Z1.Good Points- Funny community- Trading community- E - Sport- Ranks- Pre seasons- Skins- Active Staff ( Constant Updates )- Game keeps inprovingBad Points- Beta- Alot of bugs

Tried 5 five times to play it unsuccessfully and decided not to bother anymore. That`s all I had to review.If you want a Oreo Cake recipe read this:For the Cake:3/4 cup (about 3 3/4 ounces) all-purpose flour1/4 cup (about 3/4 ounce) cocoa powder1/2 plus 1/8 teaspoon baking soda1/8 teaspoon salt1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons (about 4 1/3 ounces) granulated sugar1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sour cream1/3 cup vegetable oil1 large egg1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extractFor the Oreo whipped cream:50 Oreo cookies4 1/2 cups heavy cream2 tablespoons granulated sugar1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract1.Make cake: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350°. Line bottom of a 9-inch cake pan with parchment paper and lightly coat the inside with non-stick pan spray. Sift flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt into large bowl; set aside. In medium bowl, whisk sugar, sour cream, oil, eggs, and vanilla until smooth.2.Whisk wet ingredients into dry ingredients until smooth. Pour batter into pan and bake until cake is just firm and toothpick inserted into center comes out with moist crumbs, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cake cool in pan for 15 minutes, then remove from pan to completely cool on wire rack, about 1 hour.3.Carefully cut 6 Oreo cookies in half; set aside. Chop remaining cookies into 1/4-inch pieces; set aside.4.To Assemble Cake: make the Oreo whipped cream in 2 batches. In bowl of standing mixer fitted with whip attachment, whip 2 cups cream on medium-high speed to soft peak, spoon into large bowl and refrigerate. In same mixer bowl, whip remaining 2 1/2 cups cream, sugar, and vanilla to soft peak. Fold into already whipped cream.5.Place about 1 cup whipped cream in bowl and refrigerate until ready to decorate cake. Fold chopped Oreos into remaining whipped cream.6.Slice cake in half horizontally to create 2 layers. Place bottom layer on serving plate. Spread about 1/3 of Oreo whipped cream onto cake. Top with second cake layer and use remaining Oreo whipped cream to frost top and sides of cake. Chill in refrigerator for about 2 hours to allow cookies to soften.7.Place reserved whipped cream in pastry bag fitted with star tip (re-whisk if necessary). Pipe 12 whipped cream rosettes around perimeter of cake and garnish with reserved Oreo cookie halves. Serve."

I bought it when it was on sale and man am I happy that i bought it. The game is just so addictive and keeps  you hooked in for more. The game is easily the best battle royale game casue it has that sense of reality, that hooks you closer to your character and makes you think very realistically about the decisions you make. Dont listen to the negative reviews, about bugs and hackers most people who say that are just too scared to admit that someone was better then them.Easily reccomend no matter what the price10/10"

Personally, I hate comparing this game to Player Unknown's Battlegrounds, but it feels like they're trying to turn this game into a mockery of it.  The developers listen to a small group of players, (normally ""pros"" or players that are higher on the leaderboards) so your opinion is very unlikely to be taken into consideration, even if it's of the ""masses."""

It takes forever to load in while there are other people that already loaded in and they have guns already. The game is overall not fair and the aiming is also horrible because you have barely any selections and unlike battlegrounds you cannot scope in unless you are in first person. Not being able to choose where you spawn is also a bad thing because sometimes you dont even spawn near a house and you die of either not having a gun, or gas kills you. Cars are way too loud and so are footsteps. Im deaf in my right ear and half deaf in my left and I can hear footsteps from a mile away.

Spend half game looting T-shirts, backpacks and crafting bandages, etc. Die few seconds after first encounter with another player. Repeat.Either this game adapts to certain standards or it will be always an underdog on which everyone spits and hate. Most people quit playing this game because someone else is doing a better job at developing ""battle royal"" shooter and since it's a fact it's also a proof that Daybreak is doing something if not most things wrong.While I like the idea of a battle royal on a big map this game has a real problem to deliver a quality experience. They did fix shuttering which was haunting players and now the game runs smoothly even on low-end PCs. They added new weapon and that's that. What they didn't do is they didn't remove crafting feature from the day one. They didn't add optics to the game from day one. Probably if not for PUBG they would continue ♥♥♥♥ing around with their broken game and acting like everything is fine.Pros:- Fast game finding,- Runs pretty smooths,- Decent size map,- Vehicles,- Decent amount of gear to play with,- Can be played solo or with friends,- Can be fun if you like masochism,Cons:-""TEAMERS"" up to 3-4 people teaming up (pre-game) in SOLO queue to win the game which is bascially a cheating and Daybreak isn't doing anythign about it,- RUBBISH LONG RANGE COMBAT EXPERIENCE- INACCESSIBLE SHOOTING MECHANICS- MID-LONG RANGE RNG COMBAT where you basically count on RNG to hit your target especially when you want headshots,- DAYBREAK IS FORCING FAST PACED RUN&GUN GAMEPLAY in a type of the game which works better with tactical play style simply because they want to be ""different"" than their competition PUBG thus shooting themselves in a foot and loosing players,- DAYBREAK IS PUNISHING PEOPLE for playing other than aggressive playstyle,- DAYBREAK WANTS FAST PACED GAMEPLAY while they feature systems and mechanics which slow down gameplay e.g. crafting system,- REDUNDANT CRAFTING: just give people what they need as pickup loot and that's all,- NO WEAPON ATTACHMENTS: it's outrageous to not have an optic attachments in a game where most of the combat is done medium to long range,- HORRIBLE MAP LEVEL DESIGN: Map is filled with large flat spaces seeded with copy paste rocks. I guess people designing this map doesn't understand concept of ridges and diversified terrain,- Unbalanced cars with redundant boost ability,- Too heavy focus on gameplay with cars. At some point if you don't have car you can just quit,- Too many people per game lead to mass extinction at the beginning of every game. This causes people to get frustrated and just angry because to many ppl is landing in one place,- Rifles ""random"" accuracy,- 90% of time it's a shotgun run and gun random one shot nonsense,- Redundant belt satchel and another satched which we need to find to get extra carry cap.- Min. Specs are a joke,- Code recycling: Crappy Just Survive code ported to server as a foundation for this game,- Bad vehicle physics: vehicles are too light which make them fly, tumble and do all sorts of stupid things. You can easily lose a game because of it.- Mediocre shooting mechanic/physics,- Counterintuitive ""Firing block"": blocking your guns when you are too close to a cover. It can block your gun in the middle of the fight because you are an inch to close to cover which leads to many frustrating deaths,- Inconsistent spray (at medium range you can't hit target even when you aim steady but other guy doesn't have any problem with hitting headshot on you with first 2 bullets while spraying like madman)- Inconsistent hit registration (even when you see that you hit guy straight in the head he doesn't receive damage),- Lags (even tho average ping to server location is 55ms),- Plenty of cheaters everywhere,If you have 30$ just buy PLAYER UNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS and enjoy a game made with a focus on battle royal mode not copy paste broken code form survival game like H1Z1."

I checked forum posts stating that their names would be highlighted, or that I could speak to them by pressing the Numpad 1 button. I still could not find my teammates because no one would respond to me, and there was no highlighted name to find. It comes down to the fact this game is broken. I even got so desperate that I would land next to prexisting teams in order to ask them questions, but instead of answered questions I only received bullet wounds. My advice if you want a game like this, just buy Rust. This is a cheap cash in that is marred by DLC with little to no effort required by the gamemakers. They could've added this gamemode to the prexisting H1Z1 game, but chose to sell it seperately. Buying both would cost you $40. Don't waste any money on this."

You could spend a long time on preparing your inventory only to get shot in the back two times and die. The community is full of twelve year old kids who teabag and taunt you as you get shot in the back. The whole cases and keys system is just plain bull. I saw some of my favorite youtubers play this with their friends so i purchased the game during the steam summer sale. Sadly the only reason they won and had fun was because you can play with your friends however if you dont know anyone who has this game it just becomes boring and dumb. Dont waste your money on this game.
,Recommended,433850,31663934,Posted: 10 May,all,Ryzh,This is a very skill based competitive game with alot of action in it. If your new i'd recommend this game as it will make you a better player overtime rather than PUBG. PUBG is a slow paced game that wont teach you much regardless. so far its come to my realisation that people that enjoy PUBG are low experience/low skilled players. Do yourself a favour and gets this game if your thinking between the two :)

They should have put both the game modes into one game and the problem would be solved. personally i do not like ""H1Z1 Just survive"" but im talking on behalf of the players who do.Now the good thing about H1Z1 is that its not Pay2Win. The only thing you can unbox in the crates is skins and clothing and thats a good thing.

You might be able to earn 1 free skin (garbage quality) every 10-20 hours of play, or you can fork over a few hundred dollars and try for a cool one that they keep ultra rare just to milk money from idiots.Stupid stupid stupid bugs and exploits still exist since release, such as the FOV slider increasing your zoom as you decrease it, making sniping much easier. Cars get stuck on literally nothing, flip or even explode for no reason.

,Not Recommended,433850,28230287,"Posted: 6 December, 2016",all,grizzlyyy,"Let me start this off by saying that this game could have been amazing. Sadly... it's barely even mediocre. This game has many issues and bugs that the developers have been aware of for quite some time. They either can't fix them or are simply unwilling to. Interestingly enough, with each patch they seem to create more issues than resolve. This is a recurring theme. If you ask my honest opinion, I believe that the developers are more concerned with releasing new crates and skins to make a profit than they are about maintaining the game itself. I will list some of the most important issues with this game since there are so many of them that if I listed them all this review would turn into a Lord of The Rings Trilogy.-Hitreg is terrible. You will spend many hours in awe of how none of your bullets connected on your enemy even though you were right on him.-Ghost bullets. They exist. Often times you will feel like half of the bullets your shooting disappear into thin air. Never reaching their destination. Yup, this is a thing and it's well known.-Server Dsync issues. Rubber banding and dsync are a huge issue. You will see people and objects warping around from time to time.-Foreign players overrunning NA servers. There seem to be an infinite amount of Chinese and Korean players that infest the NA servers and whom are impossible to kill with their 500+ ping.-Gas campers at the end of the game. Literally just a bunch of cuck kids that pop medkit and sit in the gas at the very end and bait other players.-You will get killed by the environment and other random things from time to time. Yesm your car will randomly explode for no reason. You'll instantly just collapse and die for no reason from time to time. It happens and more frequently than I'd like.If you've come here looking for advice on whether or not you should purchase this game. I would seriously advise you not to. It's a huge disappointment and you will feel instant regret for your purchase shortly after. I have purchased many games in my time and regretted many. This is just another one to throw onto the regret pile."

,Recommended,433850,24979855,"Posted: 17 August, 2016",all,FuckLifeWithAPussyRod,"My review of this game, is that it is a very good time consumer. If youre looking for a king if the hill type of game this is a perfect match for you. If youre looking for zombie survival, then no this is not the game for you. But anyways, the gameplay goes as said. It drops you into a large world with about 130 other players. There are vehicles to get (which spawn in set places all across the map), several handguns to find and use (which are comepletely pointless to have when you get a better weapon) there are 3 guns that you would call your primary gun. The AR15 (semi automatic) the AK47 (A fully automatic gun much more suitable for closer ranges) and finally a shotgun ( we all know what a shotgun is for). Now how to get the ammo for the weapons, it spawns on the floor next to the weapons. There is also a bow and arrow, but it isnt very valuable unless you craft explosive arrows. There are also throawble objects, grenades, molotovs, flashbangs, and tear gas. Other lootable items are two types of backpacks for storage, one holds more than the other. There are also variations of shoes you can find which slightly alter the gameplay. You can also find Body armor which protects you from bullets. You can also find medkits laying around. You will also find some clothes here and there, but theyre pretty much pointless (only used to scrap and make bandages).Now, thay recently integrated more KOTK craftable items (compared to the only item that was a bandage which heals 10% of your health.) They recently added makeshift body armor, blood cuagulant, explosive arrows and a few other things. The makeshift body armor is not very useful but the blood cuagulant is, it stops bleeding but does not heal. (Bleeding is a feature where you will drain health %. There are 5 different tiers of clood deprivation that make your health% deplete faster.) Adding craftable items is definitely a step in the right direction.Now lets talk about vehicles and how they work. There are three variations, an offroader, a truck, and a police cruiser. They recently added differences between them which is definitley another steo in the right direction. But back on track, vehicls take damage when shot, and take damage when crashing. They also have a mechanic which lets you speed up faster then just pressing W to move forward w+shift is basically vehicle sprinting mode. Vehicles also allow you to store items in the ""trunk"" of the vehicle. The vehicles also have 4 parts to them (battery, sparkplugs, overdrive, and headlights).Now its time for charecter inventory, you have 3 weapon slots to quickly switch to. These slots, are just the weapons that you can switch to without having to take them out of your inventory. And yes, throwable objects count as weapons and will consume a weapon slot. When you store items in your inventory like ammo, when you reload it will take the ammo out of the inventory automatically.As you survive longer, green circles will be put on the map. This is called a safe zone, the reason it is called a safe zone is because toxic gas moves in the map and the safe zone is where you need to be to not get injured by the gas. The reason they do this is because the longer the game goes on, the more people die, and youre left eith 30 people on this huge a$$ map, and it has to find a way to make the map smaller so the game doesnt last 4 hours.When you die youre sent back to the main screen, and have to join a new server, wait for it to fill up then you will be dropped in. But as a person who has played this game so much this is how it feels to me, Join a server, wait 2 minutes for it to fill up, drop in to the world and hope you get a good spawn, get an AR15, or AK47, kevlar/body armor and a car. If you dont find a car, have fun running to get to the safe zone from anywhere from 1-15 minutes.And if youre looking to buy this game expecting it to be like DayZ, then youre wrong, KOTK and Dayz are not compareable at all.Thats the end of my review, but the next part is just ideas that I have that could make the game much less repetitive, and are just my suggestions to improve the game overall.PLEASE OPTIMIZE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE. I have a decent computer and have to run this game on 1600x900 hdpixel plus .70 to get 45 fps. itd be so much more fun is i could get better fps, and be able to up the graphics and maintain 45 fps would be great! Please optimize it better :). This is coming from somone who has put more than 600 hours in the game. Its my most played game other than counter strike.And when you added in the player reanimation feature, it made the game so much more fun. So adding in more features would definitely help. Another thing i would like to pitch in, is adding in new weapons and more crafting. Add in a gun like an smg or something like that, just to add a little bit more variety to the gameplay. And if this is a survival based game, in a post apocolytic world, adding in crafting to KOTK, was a great intigration but i feel like there needs to be more crafteable items just to give the game more variety. I understand that there is much coding that needs to be done to fix glitches/bugs before these things need to be added in.Ive mentioned several things about variety because after playing this game so much, it just gets repetitive after 600 hours of gameplay. Variety would keep me from doing the same thing over and over again. Because the game starts to get repetitive very quickly on.Oh, before i go, i wanted to state that this game is going in a very good direction, and i love how the devs pay attention to the community, and fix what needs to be fixed. This is a great game, especially as a pre alpha game.And my last comment is that this game needs A LOT more variety. The game wont be new to you after 30 hours of gameplay, but that doesnt mean it still isnt fun as h3ll. I CANNOT MENTION HOW MUCH I WANT THIS GAME TO HAVE MORE VARIETY.Good luck devs, and please listen to the community :)-MC RIDE or Ian lmao"

The Principe is quite easy you are parachuting from the sky to a place you choose to land. Then you have to find gear such as weapons, helmets and stuff dont worry its very easy to find however you can also be unlucky and find nothing on the first try. After you geared up you have to kill the other fellow players in order to be the king of the kill. There is a safezone marked on the map where you need to go in order to live because after 4 minutes gas starts to spread which kills everything close to it (not instantly, but still very dangerous), There are even cars and quads they´re quite few in numbers so they will be most likely taken. I also recommend that if you attend to play the game you always dont go in the city directly and always gear up at a camp or so which isnt targeted as much as the city is. If you follow these steps you sure will be the king of the kill once. I hope i could help."

76561198104757617,Not Recommended,433850,31868686,Posted: 20 May,all,LeSpiper,"So, this game is a battleroyal first/third person shooter that offers competitive matches and ranks in solos and has two other more unbalanced modes. (Duos & Fives) The game has no tutorial and straight up drops you into the battle arena without any hints or tips on how to survive. I think that this is one of it's biggest flaws, even though it has a lot more then that. But my biggest 'complaint' has to be about the way the dev team treats this game, even though Daybreak is racking in a ton of money their people responsible for the balancing and mechanics of the game are treating the game as a joke.One of the great flaws of the game must be the lack of guidance within it. As I has stated before there is not tutorial or any forms of tips and hints that might guide you and at least teach you a bit about the game and it's meta at the moment. Imagin being a new player to the game, without any sort of idea what it's about or the weapons within it. One would literally not know that the AR is the main weapon one has to have, they might get discouraged due to the amount of times they die to the weapon whilst having maybe an AK or a pistol.Another flaw is the unbalance in the weapons at the moment, for example other weapons except the AR, the Shotgun or the frag grenade are never considered due to how useless they are. The game offers no diversity in it's play style.Even though all of these problems with the game plague it, the game is still fun for what it is. Thusands of people enjoy the way it plays and it's meta. But for the 20 euros that it is currently worth, I think it is an unworthy game of being in your library."

Although you can play solo, the game becomes more serious with ranks. This is the sort of late night game you find yourself playing endlessly.I have had a great experience playing this game solo and in groups (Fives and Duos). There have been many times when friends and I have found ourselves crying with laughter and having an all around fun time.DayBreak has done a great job with this game and hopefully they can keep delivering and improving the game as it moves along.

This game is now worst than when it comeout. Daybreak had the opportunity to make that BEST and far away the BEST Battle Royale and Survival game ever seen but they just throw it. I started to play this game since the beginning amd had so much fun ( at this time i tought that was a real early access and people worked on it). I just connect back today on JS to see that servers are simply ALL death (no more on top 100 steam game played). So i log in KOTK and wow...... Daybreak What are you doing??? Someone work on it? it still the same 3 spawn, non register weapon shot game. always 175 people alive to 25 in the first gaz stage. Literrally spend more time in the lobby than in the game. Still put this skirmish thing that supposed to be great because you can just play it on week end, i tried.... wait 15 minute in the lobby and game finnally started with 16 people in.. :(. I'm just sad today to see that that Daybreak kill H1Z1 by themself. This game had so many potential i had so many idea. But probably this compagny did so much money selling skin that they just abandonned the game and put all effort in skin creation (early access for life) ....

As i go over though to loot his body, the game won't let me loot a single thing from him and i get killed by someone as i'm looting the house this guy just came from. Seriously? you guys have been working a game for this long and have had countless dollars thrown at you. You should not be surprised people are flocking to PUBG by the minute. I saw a comment that only hackers and veterans play this game and i would agree. This game won't be played in a year anyway.

76561197961205841,Recommended,433850,26457148,"Posted: 6 November, 2016",all,Morphene,"I have such a love hate relationship with this game.  The underlying game and its mechanics are actually REALLY good and I can see the potential of it becoming a competetive esport game.  However, the endless bugs and poor optimization absolutely kill the gameplay.  As others have said, the devs seem more interested in patching in stuff that will earn them more money over what would actually fix the game.  It's sad that they don't realize that this actually makes them less money in the long run as players will tire of playing such a broken game.It seems like the majority of the issues stem from the game's interface.  Whoever designed it seems to have hodge podged it together and decided to never revisit it again to stamp out the bugs.  Looting items from body bags can be a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥  More than half of the time whenever I try to loot something from someone I killed, the items won't transfer to my inventory.  I'll have to close out of the window and open it back up multiple times before I can get anything to move over.  I'm actually surprised this hasn't gotten me killed more than it already has.  There's been times I've given up trying to loot and just moved on.Another fantastic bug that I often randomly experience is when I jump into a vehicle, sometimes it will just take off on me like I have the gas pedal to the floor.  I can stear but can't stop the car from moving until I hop out and watch the car coast off into the distance or crashes into a house or rock.  Of course, this often causes your vehicle to take damage or be stolen.  I've also noticed lately that if I'm in the middle of trying to reload my weapon while riding as a passenger and my driver decides to make a sudden top to hop out and fight, I'll often be stuck in the vehicle, unable to get out as I see red text across my screen saying that I can't perform that action while reloading.  Even though literally every other action in the game will cancel a reload.  This issue seems to persist at least twice as long as it would take to reload my gun as I'll already be reloaded and still unable to exit the vehicle for a few more seconds.  This has gotten some of my teammates killed several times as I'm not able to effectively back them up.Yet another fantastic bug that is a bit more rare but when it does happen is absolutely infuriating.  My teammate and I would just get fully loaded up with helmets, armor, guns, and ammo and decide to go for a joy ride to hunt for some fools.  Just as we get down the road, we'd hit some glitched terrain or invisible rock that would instantly make our vehicle explode into flames taking us both of us with it.  This always seems to happen at the most inopportune time.One of the worst things about KotK is how terrible it can run.  I exceed the recommended hardware specs for the game by a good margin and for a good part of the time am getting 60 FPS.  Then randomly, out of nowhere, my FPS will take a huge dip down to 15-17 FPS for a few seconds then will jump right back up to 60 FPS again.  I've tried turning down some of the settings but it only marginally helps the performance.  The game doesn't have cutting edge graphics and my rig is more than sufficient to play it.  To put things into perspective, BF1 looks significantly better than KotK and gives me 80-90 FPS.  Ultimately, it comes down to poor optimization.On top of the bugs, of which I've only named a few, there's MANY more, KotK is missing some features that most team based games natively have.  The biggest one being spectate mode.  Rounds in KotK can be drawn out for a while and if one of your teammates die early on, they're forced to either leave the game or stare at the same camera angle where they died.  Why can't I watch my teammate(s)?  I'd even accept being forced to watch them from a first person POV.  I've seen reddit posts from the devs claiming that this is coming but these posts are quite old now and nothing has materialized.Currently, only solo play is ranked, which I'm sure that will change before long.  But it sucks not having a visual record of what your top 10 games were, like you can see for solo.  Solo is also the only mode that is giving rewards for wins.  Otherwise, skins can be obtained frome opening chests you get every 5 levels.I would also like to see the queue system changed.  It's beyond me why you have to fumble through so many menus just to requeue for another game.  It would be nice to be able to requeue immediately after you've died.  Rather than going to a load screen, back to the main menu, then navigating to the game lobby all over again.  This is way too many unnecessary clicks and is annoyingly dumb.For anyone that has bothered reading this, you might be asking yourself why after this laundry list of issues (and I didn't even name all of them!) that I would still play this game and recommend it?  Well.. I know that the game is garbage.  It's technically still in Early Access and seems to be one of those games that will perpetually have that development status.  With all of that, I still love the game.  It's fun.  It really is.  It's a blast playing with 4 other teammates and having everyone pack into a cop car with the sirens blaring as you dodge trees and rocks while you spray an AK at your enemies and yell over voice chat for them to PULL OVER! Pull over and exit the vehicle with your hands up!  It's so supremely satisfying and exhilirating when you're ramping hills with your four-wheeler, getting some air time with your buddy on the back equipped with a crossbow and explosive arrows that smokes any car that dare tries to pursue you.In its current state, KotK is a 5/10.  If the devs would take stamping out the bugs more seriously, it could easily be a 9/10. With that, it would draw a lot more players willing to shell out money to buy crowns for chests.  I recommend buying this game only if it's on sale but definitely DO NOT buy their in-game currency for the loot chests until they can prove they're going to take the bugs they create serious enough to fix.  This game has great potential that is being squandered on doing just the bare minimum to milk its player base but at least it's still fun."

BUT too many issues atm that shouldn't be ignored and that happen often.- Lag- Weapon who don't load (happen often) even if you don't interact with anything still don't load- People who appear and diseaper or walk into a item which should be a collision and nothing happen (can't even kill someone by running on him with a car) and this game is suppose to be real ! Comon- The map sometimes has tree or doors completly not where they should be and people can shoot through itPLZ Fix this and i'll change my review.

The Menu is clunky and in a Round of King of the Kill i get Framedrops out of nowhere and i never have these Issues in for exsample Rainbow 6 or CS GO. But the Performance Issues arent everything everytime i play this game (3-6) Rounds the Physik doesnt work well or i get Stuck in a Car or Floor. I wouldnt mind because this Game isnt completly done but it seems to have no Support. I never see any Updates for it or Bug Fixes.

,Recommended,433850,23500155,"Posted: 11 June, 2016",all,| Z.N. | IRONMAN | USA |,"H1Z1’s initial release as a stand-alone survival game is a thing of the past. After Daybreak Game Company released a multiplayer “Battle Royale” mode in the game, more and more players began to make a permanent switch to multiplayer only. With the mass success of the Battle Royale multiplayer mode, Daybreak made the official decision to split the title into two separate games – H1Z1: Just Survive and H1Z1: King of the Kill. Now that we have a dedicated title to multiplayer alone, let’s discuss the massively popular multiplayer and some of the changes that came with the split.As a long time player since H1Z1’s early access, I am all too familiar with the bugging, promises of future content, patches and latency issues. King of the Kill was a chance for Daybreak Game Company to address some of those issues. I believe they have. But that is not to say it does not possess any current issues. I noticed right away that one of the major problems that was fixed is the latency on item pickup. This was a frustrating issue in the past – especially since so much of the game is based on picking up and looting gear as fast as possible before other competitors blast you with a shotgun 30 seconds into the game. Items are now seamlessly picked up and applied to your inventory for managing. Another improvement addresses aiming and bullets’ spray pattern that used to make them appear inconsistent with bullets sometimes accurate and other times not registering at all. Previously, players would overrun forums with issues reading, “Help, Launchpad won’t open,” or “Game will not join servers.” These rampant server issues for players that once seemed to be prolific amongst the community have seemed to subside. There are also far fewer connectivity issues and game crashes judging by the volume of help tickets and forum complaints. I also took into consideration that because the game is still in its early access stage, it is bound to have some problems.The environment of H1Z1: King of the Kill looks decent but is nothing to drop your jaw over. Some of the visuals have great textures and models while others are so bad they seem out of place. I found (if your computer can handle it) that going into setting and increasing the rendering distance greatly increases the visuals of the game. This does give an edge to players with more powerful computers than others. I do think however that for the incredible size of the map supporting over a hundred players, the graphics are not too bad. Not the best on the market – but not bad.I would not say that H1Z1: King of the Kill is easily picked up and played. It possesses a steep learning curve and caters greatly to experienced players. With a confusing menu and pregame lobby, many new players would be overwhelmed with not knowing what to do. With no real instruction or direction on how to play the game, newbies end up landing their parachute in a field and running for 5-10 minutes before finding a house that has already been looted of all weapons and supplies. The game also does not instruct the player on how to do basic essentials – like opening up inventory, how to craft, how to view the map, where the compass is, how to heal, where to find gear and weapons, etc. All of these variables add up to a learning curve that chews up and spits out bloodied and mangled new players. However, once all of these things are learned, 8 hours later, the competition is incredibly fun and rewarding to play. No round is the same, and with a huge map to roam, strategies change often.The game modes are consistent with the previous title featuring a solo, 2-team, and 5-team game types. I enjoyed that they kept the component that dying early doesn’t rob you of victory and rewards if your team still wins. However, playing as a team requires you to get into the top 3 instead of solo mode’s top 5 to receive rewards. Rewards still grant you permanent skins to apply to clothing. Additional skins and difficult-to-obtain competitive reward skins are sure to fulfill all of your fashionable desires. However, like any game currently on the market, micro-transactions are required in order to obtain many of these skins. I was thoroughly disappointed in the rewards chests with purchasable keys. This money grabs scheme screams micro-transactions at the top of its greedy lungs and it’s infuriating. No, thank you. Being #1 out of 150 players should be greatly rewarded.King of the Kill’s strengths lies heavily in the limitless scenarios you and your friends will encounter fighting other players. Getting a team together to ride around in a cop car with the siren roaring looking for enemies is hard to beat. Whether my friends and I were roaming the streets of Pleasant Valley or camping out in a bathroom waiting for others to perish, we were constantly laughing. This game is one of the most fun experiences I have had playing with friends in a long time. At times, we were laughing so hard we could not focus and were sent to early graves (adding further to the laughter). King of the Kill became immensely more fun when played with friends, and I recommend finding a partner to play with for some great laughs and moments. Despite all of the problems in its early access stage, H1Z1: King of the Kill is definitely worth its $19.99 sale price on Steam."

This game is excellent to play with friends and playing by yourself isn't that bad either. The main objective is for you or your group to be the last surviving people and you do this by shooting, strategizing, hiding, driving vehicles, collecting armour and weapons and by taking risks. My time playing this game has been enjoyable and I've had a lot of funny moments since I've got friends to muck around in the game with. You will find some glitches but most of them are funny. You will not be bored while looking for a match because while waiting you get sent to a lobby where you can drive cars, quads and have fun starting riots. I would say the only bad thing about this game is you find and collect crates to customise your character but most crates cost real money to unlock which isn't bad if you have some spare money but you do get a crate that doesn't cost money it's free to open. Remember this game is in early access, so there is more content to come. I give this game 8.9/10"

This garbage fire of a game has so much wrong with it that I struggle with where to begin. I'm not fantastic at this game, but believe me when I say that this message doesn't come from a ""I'm bad at this game therefor it is trash"", no, this game is just the epitome of terrible.I don't understand how a company can make a game with glaring issues like some of their weapons going through the loading animation but not actyually loading, car spawns falling through the ground and exploding, numerous buildings that have nothing in it aside from a combat knife, along with countless other core gameplay issues. And then said company has the testicles to claim that their game is an ""e-sport"". Other e-sports like League of legends, DotA, and CS all have one thing in common, and that is consistent gameplay that is relatively bug free, and if something is wrong the♥♥♥♥♥♥gets fixed. But, I guess we can chalk that up to their developers actually giving a rat's♥♥♥♥♥about their community and the game the have produced, unlike Daybreak who continually bends their community over and shoves their ever-growing-in-number of ♥♥♥♥♥ up their community's♥♥♥♥♥in the form of terrible gameplay with they two balls being numberous bugs and a complete lack of support.Take this scenario for example, say you manage to make it through the 17 screens at the start of the game without the game crashing, which is a feat in and of itself, you then have to fight the loading screen boss, and God forbid you tab out, or really even move your mouse a little, because again the game will crash. So, if you manage to make it past those two obstacles, you are now in the loading area, full of people spilling racial epitaphs with no consiquence, and then another loading screen boss, that again will probably cause your game to crash. So, if by some miracle you make it past all that, and you load into a game, you have about a 25% chance to spawn with no parachute, fall to the ground, be unable to move, and then wait to die or quit the game. But, hypothetically, say NONE of that stuff happens to you and you land properly, it's gametime woohoo! Time to loot all these weapons that a competitve e-sports arena type game will have in it, meaning evenly placed weapons and armor that would keep the game competitive right? Wrong. Maybe, if you're lucky, you'll find a combat knife and some gloves in a house or building you loot, but you can bet your♥♥♥♥♥that the bad guys down the road found a laminated armor, 17 helmets, an AR and shotgun with 300 rounds, and 22 medkits, oh and they know exactly where you are and are coming to kill you. But, praise glory you found a AK and helmet of your own! So you load your gun and are ready to fight, you peek out and pull the trigger, and nothing comes out because the AK is STILL bugged and doesn't fully load itself after going through the full loading animation, you then get on shot by a guy with a shotgun that is jumping around like a damn kangaroo, and then you get to go through the whole process all over again. that is an average day of H1Z1 folks, enjoy your game, please save your money and donate it to some charity or spend it on chipotle, or shove it up your♥♥♥♥♥for all I car, just anything but giving more money to these hacks and their ponzi scheme of a company.Please, Daybreak, do the gaming community a favor, shut down your servers for this game, cancel every project you have planned, release a press statement saying that you realized the fault of your ways, and detonate your company off the face of the Earth, because really at the end of the day you're just wasting perfectly good oxygen for us people who actually give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about how we do our jobs and the product that we put out in the world on any given day. To be clear, I don't hate the people at Daybreak, just everything that they stand and do in their lives. I mean holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ they actually think this can be an e-sport, how funny is that?

H1Z1 is good as a dayz style game & then you have a mode you could play thats more quickpace if you didnt have time for the full survive experience. But now that they want to sell the mode as its own game is retard. The game is fun yes but there is nothing else to it... I dont mean to be that guy but serious DayZ has Single player coming so we have another mode spark more fun. Yyou toke a mode from your H1Z1 out making the normal H1Z1 feel even more of an empty game...Best why i could stat this is what if Battlefield made two games of the same serious one was just the single player and the other was multiplayer. You'd be like ""WTF why are these two different games and not just one great game?""Update: Started playing King of the Kill for the first time and found at the main menu this game brokes when Alt-tabbing... How? Why? Who? What makes you think that this is ok!? I don't even wanna try when you can't even make this game work with basic windows functions... We can't even put the game in bordererless fullscreen / fullscreen / windowed mode... It's a real damn shame...Update 2: played the game for a bit more got a bronze medal and used it at the start of a match but the game doesnt tell the user what it does or what its for... Unlike minecraft the game isn't only mulitplayer and you can alt tab out of to learn about the game... Once i died I was returned back to the main menu and still no clue what it did, sadly with no global chat or text chat in general I cant ask WTF that bronze medal did for that match..."

You can buy things but with real life money for camos and clothes.And finally, the most annoying thing is you can run for ages and there isn't a gps or any easy way of navigating.I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off I wasted my money on this game. I feel bad for saying it, I'm not slating the game but, the woodland is pointless you run for miles, king of the hill wants to be a quick get in, get a weapon, cause some damage get kills and get killed or win and repeat.

Load times can sometimes be slow or you get dropped in the middle of a game while everyone has guns already. Also some genius thought it was a good idea to make it so if you see someone through a window and shoot at them then your the first bullet only breaks the window so by the second shot they run away.

There is a lot wrong with the game, and i do mean A LOT wrong with it. However i feel the need to back this game up a little bit because despite some things that need desperate improvement this game has kept me entertained through and through. Some things i personally feel they need to change to make this more about the players and less about becoming a gigantic cash cow are as followed.1: It is absolutely ridiculous that the only way you can acquire crate keys is through micro transactions, or even crates for that matter ( except the 2 crates you get at the beginning of every week). How about in Battle Royale instead of giving out extremely crappy ( and totally not worth the hassle) "" Mystery Bags"" (which by the way are completely not a mystery you are going to get a super dumb shirt or some pants no questions about it) You give out to the last surviving 5 groups or individuals something like this. #5 Mystery bag #4 Mystery Bag , Mystery Bag 2.0 #3 Mystery Bag, Maybe a uncommon skin #2 Uncommon Skin, Random Crate #1 Random Crate, Crate Key, Uncommon skin. In my own personal opinion this would be SOOOOO Much more rewarding for the players and give everyone a lot more insentive to give a flying dog snot about Battle Royale.2: It's pretty ♥♥♥♥ed up how 90% of the time when we are parachuting into the map and finally get to where we want to go for some odd reason the parachute glitches and sends you hurling back into freaking cloud 9 and you take like -15 HP damage at the very start of the game.3: Okay this one really irritates me. So if you group up in H1Z1 Battle Royale you can see your team mates name in green off the side of your screen alright cool i know who my team mates are. Now once you actually land however that is a totally different ball of wax. Once you hit the ground and armageddon 2.0 commences your first intential instect is to A: find some weapons , back pack, med kit, ext, ext. B: FIND. YOUR. TEAM MATES. Now i strongly believe that your team  mates arrows should be visible at all times. So for example as to why this makes me furious as an avid Battle Royale  player. If you are trying to take over spence hill for example, and lets say it's you and your buddy and there are 10 people left and you both are making your way up the hill there are natually trees and rocks and bushes in your way right? thats fine and dandy. Now what is not fine and dandy however is the fact that when you or your team mate just so happens to poke his or her little head behind a tree your team mates marker disappears. So naturally you kind of begin to worry. Things run through your mind like♥♥♥♥♥♥where did he go? Did they die? Did we get seperated? What did i have for lunch yesterday? And then you go on a search for your lost commrade and you poke your head behind a tree and see someone there, and you panic so you shoot that kid right in the face with your 12 gauge shot gun wild style skin and all goes flying through your victims face right into pleasant valley at  mach 5. You thought you were a god among men in this moment until suddenly to your dismay. You look up. Your eyes scroll to the left hand side of your screen only to find a red text has enveloped your team mates name. Your heart drops and your butt hole clenches. Your eyes scroll up to the top of the screen. Only to find that a white text reads "" Soandso has killed YourTeamMate With an 12 gauge shot gun : Wild style skin"" as the text flows in the air for a mere moment all your once radiating sense of accomplishment falls into a sudden erruption of rage from your team mate. He reports you for being a team killing scum bag. And leaves the game saying "" Wow you are such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥"" and your face is frozen in time with an expression of sheer horror at what you have just done. Your hands still, and heart in your left butt cheek. You uninstall the game because of the recent atrocity you have just committed. No Mystery bag, no crate, no crate keys, and a shattered heart you never return to the game due to your crimes of the past.These are just a few of the reasons this game makes me upset and i am sure has ruined the friendships of many people across the world. Please Day Break hear our cries. With just a few short patch fixes here and there you can prevent the world from thinking your game is a total piece of crap.All and all i give this game a 6/10"

Maybe or maybe not.I spended around 50h in this game. I enjoyed it at first, but once I got into it, I got more and more frustrated because of the bad optimization, hitboxes, cars, or even the slow movement.I can still recommend this game because of the price, but investing more money on skins is just stupid (my opinion). I personally have spent money on this game, and I feel ashamed of it.Oh well, H1Z1 is...H1Z1. If u like it, then u like it, It's a love or hate relationship."

It helps the game with its frame rate becuase the graphics just arent that demanding. This game isnt as fun as it used to be.

But i also understand why people are giving it bad reviews since it still has bugs in it and it crashes from time to time. Only because i love this game i wont look past its flaws but alot off people also gives it bad credit cause they are just not good or experienced at the game. Alot off my friends who plays alot of FPS games like Counter-Strike gives the game♥♥♥♥♥♥for not being able to hit the bullets. In this game there is both bullet drop,travel time and desync wich you will have to compensate for by leading your bullets and aiming a bit over the head at long range. and i have seen that this has affected some people to think the game is awful. Why i love this game is because it has so much potential to be one off the greatest games ever released IMO. If you dont like games where you have to put down some time to get good at it this game is not for you. However if you want a game that is competetive and make you want to get good at it i reccomend this product. I have played mostly solo and what i feel when i play solo is that you really are this lone wolf aiming to take everyone out wich i personally love. I can honestly say that the times i play duo/fives ive never had that much fun in a game it is both intense and fun. Hope you got something out of this review PZ! :) Upvote this if you found it to be either correct or if it helped you! :)"

76561198012379567,Recommended,433850,29181490,Posted: 11 January,all,LashedDragon,"This game is a fun hunger games style 3rd person shooter. I'm having tons of fun playing it. I have been reading the reviews and there are some bizarre things happening to people. Some reviews have shown me that they also don't have a good internet connection. So i've decided to write my own review because i have a really good internet connection and im having way less problems than most people. So i will just go over pros and cons.PROS-The game is difficult- I think there is a lot of replayability- Most players aren't toxic when you kill them and simply say ""GG""- You can queue up with random people in Duo's or Five's- You get rewards for winning your first match- You get to choose where you spawn when parachuting- You do get a free skin every 5 times you level upCons- Biggest Con is the ""reload"" glitch. What happens is when you're fighting someone and you get to cover to reload your gun occasionally the gun will only reload some of the bullets instead of the full 30 round magazine (i've seen it go down 9) and after that happens if you keep trying to reload it will only put that amount of bullets in the magazine. HOW TO FIX THIS: you simply have to unequip the weapon and pick it back up off the ground.- very rarely (only happened once top me) you wont spawn with a parachute and you will just fall 1000+ feet and not die you will just get stuck in an object until someone comes and kills you or you leave the match.Those are the only glitches i've come across.- This is more of a personal opinion con. I don't like the skin system. The only way to look cool is to buy skins with real money. There are two other ways but they take forever to do them. There is another type of currency called Skulls, you get skulls by backing your match either using skulls you already own or your free backing you get for playing the game. Basically what it is is you're betting that you will get a high placement in the match. You don't have to get first place i think you get from 60-1000 coins depending on your placement. However unless you're really good at the game you wont know what placement you will get. Last way to get skins besides lvling up, there is something called scrap. Every 100 scrap you collect you will get a free skin out of a certain pool of skins. How you get scrap is you have to recycle the skins you dont use and they will give you an amount of scrap (depending on the rarity of the item scrap amounts vary)Even through these cons i still really like the game. Of course it has room to improve, every game does. I still highly recomend it.Let me know if this review was good i dont review stuff often. Thanks :)"

So many hackers it's insane, to buy clothing (even stupid ugly clothes) costs a freaking fortune, the aiming is awful, and the list goes on and on.  If you've considered buying this game, please don't...buy Battlegrounds and don't look back!!  This game has been in Early Access for so freaking long it's pathetic!  Companies should be heavily penalized for doing this crap, it's not fair and it's as dirty as it gets.  It was suppose to be released by now, yet here it is.  They've ignored the community, pretty much paying them no attention and just wanting their money.  They stopped updating the game, that is, until Battlegrounds came out...then all of a sudden the community's opinion mattered and they were scrambling to fix their POS game.Well, it's too late Daybreak.  Your game is getting ready to be flushed and it makes me so glad to see a developer finally get screwed over after taking advantage of your player-base for so long!  Just stop updating the game like you were doing...you're just wasting your time and money at this point, because it won't be long at all before everyone has switched to PUBG!  I bet PUBG has had more updates in the last few months than this game has had since it released 2 years ago.  They've already done such great things and I can't wait to see where it goes!

YES, the game has had many bugs and things of that nature over the course of it's development. YES, Daybreak hasn't been as prompt or precise as we would all enjoy them to be in the development of this game. BUT. Oh my god. This game is awesome. The adrenaline rushes you get in a high-speed chase or a 5 on 5 shootout are fantastic. Since the most recent overhaul of the UI and the in-game graphics, I have been even more excited about this game. The new UI is great, it has many features like queing corrections and skin customization that were much needed before. This game is going in the right direction. Daybreak has shown that they do indeed listen to the players. This game isn't out of early access yet BECAUSE THEY WANT TO GET IT RIGHT BEFORE THEY CHARGE FULL PRICE. Get your head out of your chocolate pocket and look at the concept. This game is made to be intense and difficult to win. I love it.Pros:-VASTLY improved optimization after the recent graphic overhaul-New map is fantastic and includes many varieties of combat situations-Options to play solo, in 2 man squads, and 5 man squads-Fast-paced, intense gameplay-EXPLOSIVE ARROWSCons:-Servers go down for a bit longer than desired for maintenance-Still some minor bugs with every update it seems (DOES NOT RUIN GAMEPLAY)-Community sucks mostly, but hey, this is PCNote: I have 150+ hours on this game, but when they split Just Survive and KOTK, all of the hours went to Just Survive."
