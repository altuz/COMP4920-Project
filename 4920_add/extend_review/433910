I recommend it, but NOT to everyone.Really captures the 80's vibe, this is not some half-4ssed retro exploit, it's the real deal! Made with love, and you'll feel it from the first second.Presentation is 10/10, music and everything is great, but beware the levels as beautiful as they are challenging!(*EDIT: since today's update, there is a Free Ride mode – once you beat a level on Normal, you can choose to just have a relaxing ride looking at the (amazing) landscapes.*)It's a rhythm game, but the patterns are set, not randomly generated, so you *can* and WILL have to learn them. While they are connected to the music, being very much into music (like me) can work against you, when the music makes your fingers want different things than the devs had in mind.There are checkpoints, but only in Normal mode. In this game, Hard *is* hard. So you should have a mild tolerance for frustration, if you want to get all of the achievements.Final words: I could listen to the main menu music for HOURS, fembots and arcade machines rule, and I *definitely* want to see more from these devs!"
,Not Recommended,433910,32580142,Posted: 19 June,all,Turd Flinging Monkey,"This isn't a rhythm game, it's a trial-and-error memorization game where you have to die at the same part over and over again until you memorize that section of the level, get into ""the zone"" and let muscle memory take over ... then repeat the process for the next checkpoint.I beat the entire game on ""normal"" mode, and they clearly used the game's punishing difficulty to mask it's short length. The ""practice"" mode also doesn't let you slow down the troubling sections, it just breaks the level into smaller checkpoints.The music and visuals are really nice, but this is more of a ""rage"" game than a music game."

,Not Recommended,433910,24166796,"Posted: 7 July, 2016",all,Stexen92,"An 80's Love Letter That Just Falls ShortDon't let my ""Not Recommended"" rating dissuade you - Neon Drive is the most intense, addicting, visually arresting rhythm game that I sadly cannot recommend outright to everyone.  It's at times like these that I wish I had a different option other than a simple ""Yes/No"" answer.  This game is good - very good in fact - but it has problems that prevent it from being great.  If you love rhythm games, challenging difficulties, or the 80's aesthetic then you'll probably love this game as much as I do.  However, if not then don't let this game be your introduction.GameplayIn terms of gameplay, Neon Drive is similar to other rhythm games in that you move your vehicle left and right to dodge incoming obstacles.  The twist offered here is that instead of dodging around the musically generated obstacles, you drive to the music itself, shifting to the beat.Herein is where the difficulty of the game relies - you need to move along the path in time to the music or else you'll hit the obstacles and have to restart.  Added difficulty comes in how the obstacles are laid out to form the path - sometimes multiple paths will be available with only one letting you through, other times the obstacles will move on the track to obscure the way forward.  With a little practice, though, you can find your way through.And this is where the first big problem with the game.  Once you beat the level, you've seen everything it has to offer.  The higher difficulties are only ""harder"" because the song speeds up a little.  There are no additions to the levels and no new mechanics are thrown in to vary the gameplay.  Even when you transform into different vehicles like a hovercar or fighterjet, the mechanics remain the same: move left or right to dodge obstacles.(This becomes especially problamatic when you become a Transformer in the final level and have to jump or slide using the left and right buttons instead of shifting to the up or down buttons - it's very jarring)This kind of repetition is very dissappointing to me since there's so much potential for additions to each level.  If each higher difficulty added a new section and changed up existing sections in the level, then that would give the game significantly more depth of play.That's not to say there isn't fun to be had.  Each level is unique and puts different twists on the game to create new and vastly different experiences.  The difficulty is fair and evenly ramps up throughout the game.  I mentioned the hovercar and fighter jet, buteachlevel puts a spin on the base gameplay that keeps the game fresh as you progress.  And the soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal, expertly evoking the synth and rock of the 80's era.  If the OST could be bought by itself, I'd wholeheartedly recommend getting it.Aesthetic AppealThe other big selling point for this game is how much it evokes the futuristic ideas of the 80's, and to that end it absolutely nails it.  Each level looks like it comes straight out of an 80's sci-fi movie or cartoon (some more literally than others).  The artists did their jobs with flying colors, especially given how diverse each art style is.It's just a shame that it can't be fully appreciated when playing the game.This game requires intense concentration  on the track, for to get distracted by the backgrouds and level design would mean almost certain failure.  As such there are details in the levels that will go entirely unnoticed unless you purposefully take your eyes of the track and admire the art for two seconds you have until you hit an obstacle.  The track and the surroundings are both screaming for your attention, and more often than not it's gonna be the surroundings that get neglected.  Had the game been designed in such a way as to let you take in the surroundings while still successfully navigating the level, weaving the two together in harmony rather than clashing with each other, then this could have been a great music & art game with the rhythm-action companants as a bonus.Update - 2017-01-21:With the latest update, Free Run Mode is now available which does allow to take in the artistic design without needing to worry about failure.  In fact, some of the levels have had redesigns to accomodate this mode - very considerate.  It also has a neat little ""Hit The Targets"" objective to it (though I don't think the scores count for anything).  While this does allow for observing the art of Neon Drive, the targets are still a little distracting in some areas.  They should be replaced with something more subdued, like bars on the track. I do really like the triangles in Level 3 though - they can most certainly stay.What?  I like triangles.In Conclusion...As I said before, this is the greatest game so far that I won't recommend to everyone.  It's got interesting gameplay, awesome music and beautiful art design, but lacks the depth and cohesiveness to create something truly worth everyone's notice.  I wish I could give it a thumbs sideways because many people will enjoy it and many won't.  This really is a game dependant on your personal preferences (I know that's probably a useless statement but I feel it's apt for this situation).  A the very least this game accomplishes exactly what it set out to do so in that regard it's a success.  It's just a shame that it isn't taken further to achieve the greatness it absolutely deserves.FInal Score: 6.5/10"

I was born in the 80's so it has a nostalgic feel to it.  The gameplay however is challenging.  This game isn't very casual.  This is a good game to play to test your mental reflexes.  As you drive down the road you have to dodge obsticles until you get to the end.  The controls are very simple: Left, Right, Pause/Menu.  I use a Xbox controller and it works great with this game.  I recommend Neon Drive.  The visuals and music is enjoyable and the game is challenging enough to keep you playing.Pros:Very 80's styleRelaxing reto musicA good level of challengeEasy controlsAfter completing a level you're able to play a Free Run of that level that's very casual and enjoyable.Cons:This game is challenging and may be tough for people wanting to joyride through this game."

Many complain about the difficulty but it's really all about muscle memory, like most rhythm games. However timing is everything with this game, so unless one is pin point precise with their key strokes, some may struggle with the very steep learning curve. If you feel up to the challenge of learning how to adapt to this title’s difficulty, then eventually you’ll breeze through the levels no problem. Alongside it’s engaging presentation and aesthetic this game can be very satisfying...that is, if you have the grit and the patience to give it a chance."
,Recommended,433910,30819151,Posted: 29 March,all,Bass][e,"★★★★☆Only 7 songs, but each one is memorable because it's visually so different from another. Perhaps they are not equally amazing (I don't like much about the last one), there are some real gems in here of which you want to play everyday just for the music and aesthetics alone, trying to master it. For me, this and the achievements are the reason to come back to this game frequently.First time players might be intimidated by the difficulty, but with practice comes rewards (in the form of achievements). I don't know why I didn't mind retrying the same song again and againfor an hour straight only to get it finished on Insane, considering I believe I don't have a lot of patience. But the success I've reached made me feel amazing.I normally never play Rockband and I was pretty bad a Rythem Heaven Paradise on the Nintendo DS. Maybe Neon Drive came into my life at the right moment, maybe it's the whole design around it that I found so pleasing. Either way, the devs took the game seriously enough, that they'll give you a warning if your game is running on a low framerate. Being frame perfect isn't necessary (it's not at a level op speedrunning) but it'll come down to a quarter of a second at moments. It's this level of polish that I find so nice. It's like the devs respect your time and want you to feel amazing.Having said that, the enjoyment obviously depends on the music preference and your will to practice levels. In that case, it's not for everybody. Give it a try, because I believe this is a great addition to the rhythm genre of videogames."

,Not Recommended,433910,33113851,Posted: 1 July,all,Zelus,"I really, really want to like this game but its difficulty curve and mislabelling as a""rhythm"" game turn it into a really conflicting experience.There are only a handful of levels, and they each require that you beat them on ""Normal"" before the ""Hard"" and ""Insane"" modes are unlocked. Level 1 is a breeze, but level 2 is a wall of failing, cursing, and really awkward button timings. Also, the ""Normal"" timings are too tight to be considered normal at all.This not a rhythm game, at all. The paths and movements do notconsistentlyalign with any part of the music. It flips back and forth between followng the bass and main progression erratically. 2000 hours of Stepmania and OSU! will not prep you for this; in fact, it will hurt to play.Also, no mappable input options. For a two button game. C'mon, really?On the flip side, the visual aesthetic is dripping with cool-ness and style, and the music is very fun.This basically falls into the same pitfalls as Bit Trip Runner. As a game this is poorly done. If you're going to get this game, only get it for the soundtrack."

It's VERY difficult, especially comparing to modern PRESS X TO WIN games. No wonder there are so many negative reviews complaining about Neon Drive's difficulty - kids novadays just don't have any will and ability to surpass difficulties. This game is perfect for any gamer who like and want a real challenge - when you try for like 50 times and finally complete the level - it is the only way to have a real satisfaction and to feel that you've really earned your victory. 99% of modern games don't give you that feeling.Gameplay itself is simple, but very good - I just wish there were more levels. 2-part levels with totally different gamedesign must be the highlight of this game - developers showed a massive creativity here and I hope they have a few more ideas for the future. Music is just awesome - it fits game perfectly and it's really good for listening outside of the game.So far I've completed all levels on all difficulties and without any checkpoints and I have only endurance mode left to be beaten. Definitely want more levels :)Since I've bought the game there was only 1 update that fixed music sync and also my personal problem with launching on the wrong display on my setup (thanks for the quick fix!), but game seems to be very promising on future updates.I'm all yours for the paid sequel with more awesome levels and challenges."
,Recommended,433910,22932380,"Posted: 12 May, 2016",all,Apothecarrion,This is a rhythm game where you pilot a car around blocks in your path that correspond to the music. The soundtrack is pretty good electronic 80s inspired tunes and the game play is solid though simplistic. Left and right are your controls on keyboard and dpad or a and b on gamepad.My only quibble with the game is that its SO frustratingly difficult. You do see improvement as you go along but I have been unable to complete any of the levels. luckily all the levels are open from the start so you get to mix up the song selection as you try to progress farther and farther.Its worth its asking price if you like rhythm games and I see myself coming back to it when I need a quick diversion.

,Not Recommended,433910,32582016,Posted: 19 June,all,Kinjry does a thing,"I had fun with this game but can't recommend it due to issues that make the hard/insane difficulties far more difficult than they really need to be.The plane level has a loop that basically doesn't interact with the music at all, forcing you to just figure it out via trial and error.The falling traffic section has cool music that doesn't help you in any way. It's just falling enough times to memorize a safe path through.The Robot level has a series of hurdles that require the first jump made be well timed. There is no useful music for the first jump, in fact there's a misleading series of notes that will get you killed if you use them. The following hurdles all have super useful notes to help, but this doesn't matter if your first jumps timing is off, you'll die on the later hurdles if it is. ((I guess it's possible to ajdust your timing between hurdles, but that's like, tasbot levels of reaction time. Not what rhythm games are about)) This problem exists on other levels, but it's not as pronounced as it is in the robot level, due to its unique mechanics.The game also has a nasty habbit of switching which notes are useful to you between transitions. For one area it might be synth blasts, for another it might be beats. Some levels will use a note for a particular section, then add that section in again later in the level, using different notes. This wouldn't be so bad, except the same beats from before are still around, making it really difficult to understand which notes you should be responding to when deciding your timing. This basically asks the player die in this section so they can memorize which notes are useful.I really want to recommend this game, but if you plan on beating all 3 difficulty levels, the above mentioned problems will stand out and become exceptionally frustrating elements of gameplay that just suck all the satisfaction out of the otherwise fantastic gameplay.If the game gets patched or something to address these issues I'll change my tune, otherwise this game is only fun in normal mode. And frustrating for the wrong reasons in hard/impossible."

It’s a fun, fast paced and challenging rhythm game with great music and visuals to go along with it. It’s got a very cinematic feel to it that shines in the environments and transitions.The main problem I have is that there are a lot of sections that aren’t synched to the music whatsoever. First four levels don’t have very much of this but from the fifth onward the music often offers no help in the secondary sections.The difficulty setting’s also a little boring too. It’s especially tedious on stages that have lots of rapid switching between lanes, but for the most part no stage is unbeatable.Neon Drive is definitely not a game for someone with short patience, as you will be dying a lot first time through and even more so on harder difficulties.

If you're going for memory-based, most stages are too repetitive and slow to the point of screwing up on something simple, causing frustration.7.The 5th stage's hover car segment,especially the downwards flight, is extremely annoying and almost impossible due to the fact it's trial and error to the extreme.-----------------------------In short,the game is a amazing idea, with everything being there for a good game, but having the execution of it flop. The game is frustrating and instead of the player feeling at fault, they feel it's the game's fault for failure. It's impossible to beat it the first time without dying at least one due to inconsistency and how the stages are designed for trial and error. Maybe with some work, it can be improved past it's current state.By the way, I only had fun at one part. ~30%-55% of stage 2, where the game really shines and shows what it could have been, with quick reaction times and the music syncing perfectly with the stage's layout."

I'm glad I paid extra for the soundtrack.- Some sequences tie to the music better than others.+ I appreciated the ability to fine-tune the music to be ahead or behind the visuals.- Playing on normal, the difficulty seemed a little uneven, e.g. there were very hard sections followed by considerably easier sections.+ The interface is clean and understandable.  You'll pick up how to play very easily.- I expected better performance for a game like this.  I had to turn down the graphics considerably for a good framerate."

There are 7 levels of the game, and although you could technically beat each level in a little less than 5 minutes each, the difficulty of even the normal modes will have you playing these levels over and over until you can do them with your eyes closed. Although the quality (the quality of the level design, and the music that accompanies it) varies from level to level (watch out for level 2, as it's a doozy), the overall presentation holds it together. Alongside this, this game reminds me a lot of Geometry Dash, as it has a similar feel. I recommend it to anyone who loves arcade-like games, rythm games, or Geometry Dash.Update: After 10+ hours of playing I still haven't even started the last level. For those who need/love replayability in their games this game is replayability THE GAME!"

It's just a shame that the actual game design sucks!I wasn't expecting much, just a nice drive through a beautiful landscape with a retro synth soundtrack; but what I got was hectic non-stop obstacle avoidance. The obstacles all fly at you thick and fast and not entirely in time to the music. The margin for error is incredibly narrow and making one mistake means you have to restart.The biggest problem here is fatigue; if you blink you're going to crash, so keeping your eyeballs open for long enough to get to the next checkpoint is the main enemy here. After you've completed the level on Normal you can replay it at a 'harder' difficulty level, but that only changes the speed at which the level moves - honestly I found going through them faster to be slightly easier, it meant my eyeballs didn't have to spend so long drying out.I can't overstate just how beautiful the music and visuals go together. Driving through a gorgeous landscape that changes in time to the music would be wonderful, but you don't have time to appreciate it, and after restarting the level for the sixty eighth time it really just starts to get on your nerves."

Why would you put the camera at a super slanted angle when there's flat obstacles on the track making them just barely visible?

The game could have been a comfy casual chill sort of arcade game, but some levels are just a complete MESS. There's a section, level 3 second half, where you're expected to predict and dodge incoming laser beams. It took me a while to get exactly where the hitbox of the lasers are at and how they function. So this section ended up becoming more of a memory type ""puzzle"", but that has no place in this genre, as far as I'm concerned.Another attempt as something cool, unique, and diverse, yet becomes a mess - I believe it was level 5 second half, where you're flying down through traffic. Here, you're expected to gauge the speed of the whole line of traffic you're moving into as well as the next. You're also expected to figure out which of the cars will actually get in your way. Yet another really cool concept that just becomes a memory game. To further their desire to make you replay ad nasuem to get more play time out of the game overall, there are sudden and surprising jumps in puzzles. What I mean by this is you're going through your block puzzle, reach a blinding white light and are immediately subjected to a new block where 3/4 are closed and only one path is open. This leads to taking hits that feel cheap and unrewarding.Maybe this isn't what I thought I was getting into, but I don't love it. Overall I just feel ""meh"" about it. Even though there are a lot of seriously anger inducing sections of the game, other parts of it help counter that.

There's a pretty solid synthwave soundtrack which is integral to the rhythym gameplay aspect, it's all pretty straight forward and easy to get into (there are only 2 controls!). Not a lot of depth to the content (perhaps more will be added in the future?) but there are some really cool perspective changes part of the way through a course to shake things up and overall the levels are really challenging.Game length depends on how good or bad you are and whether you're interested in playing the other difficulties to get achievements and what not. It took me 3 hours or so to pass through it's 7 levels on the lowest difficulty setting. There is a free run mode which is nice and chill, no obstacles or hazards in your way, you can just cruise and feel the rhythym as you hit the music notes sprinkled along the track. Finally there is an endless/endurance mode where you can see how long it will take before you inevitably mess up.You will crash and you will either start from a checkpoint or no checkpoints at all depending on the settings.

And asthetically THE BEST game I've ever had the privedge of looking at. For one it has three different levels of difficulty ranging from Normal, Hard, and Insane. Actually there is four difficulty levels as the developers added in a sort of bonus difficulty above Insane. ""Classic Layout"" is a little check box that you can tick that has the initial obstical layout that the developers deemed ""too difficult that it had to be changed."" I don't want this review to end up being a novel but basically know this: Great addictive gameplay. Many difficulty settings. It's very challenging.

Make no mistake about it, this game's simplistic setup is controller breaker for sure. With track progress measured and saved as a percentage, the feedback loop is strong, you will find your self deciding for one more play when ever you start to quit, just to finish a stage or eek out a higher percentage, as visible proof of your improving skill.That by itself is a strong setup for an arcade style game, but Neon Drive  goes the extra mile, by introducing varied play based around the position changing mechanic. At the most basic level your a car who instantly change lanes with a tab of one of the controller bumpers, and must do so early and often in order to avoid obstacles in the road. This is expanded upon as you go deeper, with an overhead mode, an astroid defense mode and even an afterburner esque flying mode to name just a few.Absolutely worth the price of admission, just know you may be budgeting for a new controller after some heavy play"

The game surprised me in astonishingly gorgeous ways. Looking now more closely at the store page I realize how much less impact some of those surprises might have had on me. Not surprisingly I also dislike over long movie trailers and think they do the viewer a disservice.The music in this game is great and I like how well they did syncing it up to the gameplay. One of the neat features is the free-run mode which lets you experience the levels in a failure-less way while still giving a little something to do besides just watch the pretty shiny graphics and lisen to the tunes.Beating normal mode (1st of 3 difficulties) took about an hour and a half. I found this difficulty to be just right for the most part, it gives room for making mistakes and checkpoints you at convenient places. There are few segments that are legit frustrating. Getting past these spots was quite rewarding as the game reveals new twists. It's a generous game both in presentation and in exploration of its game mechanics.Recommended!"

,Recommended,433910,23274420,"Posted: 29 May, 2016",all,Fourvel,"Neon Drive is a rhythm game with a great retro aesthetic.  The difficulty is also very reminiscent of the games from my childhood, because there used to be only one type of challenge: pattern memorization.  You play it again and again until the pattern starts to stick in your head, and your subconscious can start pressing the buttons faster than you can processes the visual information.  It feels difficult because I takes a comparatively long time for a pattern to sink into most people's brains, but finally completing a level is all the more rewarding for it.Though there's a design choice to some levels in these types of games that I hate, which is the long, tedious first half of a level.  It doesn't require much memorization and learning, as it's pretty much just the same thing over and over again.  But it does require me to execute it perfectly every time, otherwise I die.  So once I finally get past it and reach the more mentally stimulating second half of the level that requires learning complex patterns, my brain gets distracted and I then die repeatedly on the tedious portion.  This happens over and over, making the learning of the interesting second half take forever as I slowly memorize piece by piece after repeated early failures.  And then parts I thought I had down give me trouble, and by that time I've played the level 193 times.I'm enjoying the nostalgia despite all the expletives I've hurled at the screen.  But I'm glad that this isn't the only type of difficulty in games any more.  Learning a skill, for example the skill it takes to play a game like Rocket League, is much more fun, in my opinion, if slightly less rewarding.  It makes the journey the entertaining part of the game, instead of just the end goal of completion.  But I'm having nice addictive fun all the same."

For the tone deaf among you or those who don't play rhythm games... you may find this a bit hard.Case in point: the first level has a ""classic"" mode that was ""too hard"" - but it took me 3 attempts, only because the end has traps (i.e, move the wrong way and you die) and two of my failures were to that.HOWEVERNot actually as in-sync with the music as it suggests!

Level 7 is still crazy hard though.I love Synthwave music & I love this art style.I also like a lot of twitch control lane-switching games.However, the controls are such a letdown in this game, it's a big part of why this is so hard; the car feels too unresponsive that if you make any mistake that you can't correct it at all, you can't change lanes quick enough which takes out all the close calls that make lane-switching games fun.The controls lack that tightness that makes these things great & it is such a disappointing thing because it looks beatiful, it sounds great & some of the obstacle design is really great (level 7 with it's Klax design is inspired & incredibly difficult).I also don't feel that the music does sync up at all with the obstacles despite what the Store Page says.Tighter controls would make this the total package for me, pretty much everything else is fine.Although I don't really consider a website link & a Facebook link to be Extras, but that seems to be a thing with mobile games in general, so whatever; the Wallpapers are nice though."

More neon."" And this game is that. Neon lights all around, making it near impossible to play without being on some kind of high. Okok enough fluff, let's talk gameplay. It's Audiosurf but better. Using your retro-styled car, you cruise between barriers in time with the music. Actual skill comes in as the music gets faster, and you have a lesser window for error. The controls are tight and when you eventually screw up for the 7634th time, you know it's because you're not that good yet. If there are audio sync issues there is a slider to correct that as well. A very unique feature that sets this game apart is that the levels change halfway, giving a varied experience for each level, compared to the monotonous feel of games like Audiosurf. The music is phenomenal, and gives me nostalgia of music that I never even experienced in the 80s cos, well, I wasn't born yet. The visuals are exceptional, and really give off a very 80s vibe. and it is incredible to see the different themes they have between the levels.Now with all this being said, this game still has its demerits. There are only 7 levels for you to play with. Although they have 3 difficulties each, they are still basically the same. Personally, I completed all 7 levels on normal within an hour. There is an endurance mode, however that is really just playing through the same levels again without a break in between. In terms of game length and replayability, Neon Drive does not have much to offer. As such, the price may come across as a little steep for some of us. However, the real gameplay in this game comes from the sheer difficulty of it, and playing the game to 100% would take someone a considerable amount of time. So if you can get past the small number of levels and want a challenge, it will give you exactly what you want.TL:DR versionPros:Twitch reaction gameplay (AKA Insanely difficult)Awesome music that syncs with gameplay flawlesslyBeautiful visuals80s referencesLevels that transform halfwayNeonCons:Small number of levelsNeon"

Worth the $4 price though.Although some sections can get pretty tricky, the key is to memorize the patterns. Thankfully the game is pretty forgiving and, on normal mode at least, allows you one mistake without a restart and also employs a few checkpoints per level so you shouldn't get stuck for too long. I think the difficulty is tuned well for enjoying the music and visuals while still offering a decent challenge. I wouldn't mind seeing an easier mode for those who are having trouble with the difficulty though.Please make another one of these! The surprising diversity in scenarios makes this game really fun while the visuals and music keep you wanting more. Love it!"
,Not Recommended,433910,33056356,Posted: 30 June,all,Sabrewylf,"I expected something arcady that played akin to OutRun. This is not that kind of game.The car is on rails and there are four lanes. Kind of like you do in AudioSurf, but the premise of the game itself is more like Super Hexagon: various difficulty levels and an emphasis on perfect runs. However Super Hexagon is still playable to an extent without entirely knowing the levels by heart. This game isn't, the level will sometimes just checkmate you into a situation that you could only have prevented if you knew it was going to show up beforehand.And other than that, the downtime between runs in this game is just a bit too high, especially if you're used to Super Hexagon where it's instant and here you get to stare at a loss screen for 2 seconds. Doesn't seem much, but remember this game is 100% trial and error. So you'll stare at loss screen often.Overall it's not a high price but it's not the kind of game you'd expect it to be, and there are better alternatives for the game it does turn out to be. What this game DOES get right though is visuals and audio. The overall aesthetic is something the devs really nailed down."
,Not Recommended,433910,32588828,Posted: 20 June,all,Kaseda,"Tl;dr - Great graphics, good gameplay, but not enough content and some design issues that don't warrant a $10 price tag.Apparently some people found the game frustrating to play. As for me, within my first 1.5 hours of play (at the time of writing this review) I beat every level on normal difficulty and 2 on insane (completely skipping hard difficulty). This leaves me with 5 levels to complete on insane and, although there's no point, 7 to complete on hard.You'll notice an issue immediately- there's only 7 levels. There are 3 difficulties, but a higher difficulty is simply a faster speed. Of each of them, they all feature a standard 'block dodging section.' Each level also has a special section. In the first level, it switches to a top down perspective and you dodge cars. In the second level, instead of dodging blocks, you are trying to stay on a road which has disappeared.Unfortunately, there are some issues I have with this game. One of the levels changes in such a way that you become a flying car. You are then tasked with dodging very tight traffic, which sometimes causes vision issues and you can't see where you have to go next. However, that is nothing compared to the section that follows. You then nose-dive, and must dodge moving traffic that is going perpindicularly. Unfortunately, this either requires memorization or a lot of practice to develop a sense for the movement of the vehicles. This level took me by far the longest, even longer than either of the levels I played on insane difficulty. There is also a level where you turn into a plane and must dodge bricks radially (look at the screenshots and it will become more clear). There are two sections where you must keep going in one direction, however, unfortunately, this section is not related to the rhythm of the game, so how fast you must mash left or right is a guessing game and can cause you to lose quite easily.I didn't find the actual rhythm of the game frustrating, except for the case just mentioned. However, I am a musician, so my rhthmic skills are much higher than a normal gamer's. The standard brick dodging sections caused me almost no issues, especially if you could identify the patterns of the bricks. Some of the transformations are difficult for various reasons, but still passable with enough time.Is this game worth $10? No. I have already mentioned that I have compelted each level on basic difficulty and could skip hard difficulty to go straight to insane with little challenge. I may have my play time drawn out by the problematic levels mentioned above on insane, but whether or not I return at all is questionable. I purchased this game on sale for $2.99 so I won't bother returning it, but it isn't worth it unless you can pick it up for ridiculously cheap."

I have a grin on my face all the time playing it :DPumping music and neon Tron graphics driving - I think - an old Audi (?!) induce 80's Arcade feeling.There are three difficulty levels to be chosen from, Normal, Hard and Insane, while Hard and Insane need to be unlocked by completing Normal mode first. I liked the game even that much, that I finished all levels in normal hard and insane difficulty. It's challenging and fair, because you have checkpoints during the tracks. But the real challenge is not to blink with your eyes holding them open all the time while dodging an obstacle sequence, hehe ^^And yes, sometimes you have to trial & error your way through and memorize the pattern, but for me this is part of the fun. I don’t get why this bothers so many players since trial & error is a process commonly used and wide spread through all genres and kind of games. Why trial & error is a bad thing here and not in Dark Souls or any Shoot ‘Em Up or any Platformer? In this game this is really not a big deal, because you get to the point again where you failed really quick. The checkpoints are also placed reasonably close to each other. In my opinion anyone complaining here about trial & error has not much perseverance.And the ones complaining about dead ends should go back a step and play Memory Cards first so that they can remember the right way. This is no big deal either, because you can slightly see them, the ""dead end"" is not a long distance before you notice it but only 2 car lengths and after a couple of quick tries you got the hang of it and don't step into these anymore.The levels are in sync with the music. If you have a short delay, maybe because of a computer specific reason, you can adjust the music delay at all times in the pause menu and for each level individually. Some are stating that the music gets out of sync after a saved collision. I cannot confirm this as the music stayed in sync for me.The difficulty levels only differ in speed and amount of checkpoints.There are seven tracks. It's really cool, but I would not want to pay the full price for it, because it's only Audiosurf 80's Edition and some camera changes and other nice ideas. But I definitely enjoy every part of it!Advice: ControlsBest way to use the controller is to have the right thumb on the right button (""B"") and the left thumb on ""Left Arrow"" of the D-Pad. This is better than using ""Left"" and ""Right"" on the D-Pad or the ""A"" and ""B"" buttons with only one thumb, because you save moving your thumb from one to the other button.Advice: Music DelayMost stages synchronized best for me with a music delay of +0.500"

The game is extremely pleasing to watch, as the design work and colors are beautifully done, but some people have complaints about the need to memorize the levels to pass them, saying this isn't how a rhythm game should be done.I disagree.Although different, and more challenging than other rhythm games, this fact doesn't make Neon Drive a bad game, it just means you have to adapt to this game without assuming its like other games.Overall, here's my opinion:Pros:Very well done soundtrackClean, retro/80s style graphicsLicense plate customizationExtra features on the levels, and on your vehicle! (you'll see what I mean when you play)Fairly good response system (I played with a keyboard, so I can't say for controllers). The game answered my turns quickly.Sexy main menu android ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)The main con:The game can get frustrating on difficulties above normal, as failures take time to start up the level again and if you screw up once you're back to a checkpoint/the start. This won't be terrible once you've played for a few hours, but for starters its a lot like Dark Souls. It'll have you hitting something in anger.Overall, for anyone who enjoys aesthetically pleasing games or rhythm games $10 is a great price for this game. If it goes on sale even lower snag this ASAP.

Unfortunately, these bring down the FPS a lot, at least with the hardware on my disposal.
