I love this game, the battle sequence, the music, the characters, the humor. All of it combined, just makes this a one-of-a-kind RPG. If you like RPG maker games, you should definitely give this one a try."

The humor always makes me laugh so hard. I just love it.I played all the aveyond series and none of them were bad. they're more than good and i so recommend this game."

Great for new players to the series/RPGmaker as it can be played as a stand alone game, and for players of previous Aveyond games there are a few easter eggs that will make you laugh. The dialouge is unique, humorous and engaging, and the story is rich and well rounded. Plenty of side quests to keep you entertained, and multiple endings. The puzzles are fantastic, not too easy but not impossible. The playable characters each have their unique fighting style and are all equally strong, which makes it a difficult choice to choose which ones to play (which in my opinion, is a good thing because you don't have to play characters that you don't like just because they are stronger). Speaking of characters, all characters gain experience points even when not in play, so if you end up wanting to switch later you don't have to go back and grind to raise the level of the excluded characters. The footsteps get a little annoying but I soon forgot after about 5 minutes of playing. Overall, I really enjoyed this game, the developers  for Aveyond really did a great job with this one."

Full screen stretches the game for wide screen.Slow movement. Several things go into this complaint. I'll detail it in full at the bottom.Audio slider for sound does not work.Positives:Story starts out fun and strong. Loses some focus in the middle but never becomes tedium.Mechanics are an embaressment of riches. Every character has their own.The meta dungeon was inventive. Cool idea well executed.Being able to steal anything on the usuable item table was great.Item that let's you see goodie rooms. Saves me from looking up (more) spoilers online.Boyle's starting pokemon is the best pokemon for the whole game.No random encounters, in spots this lets you run past higher level enemies to loot things.Slow movement:Late game there's no teleportation between cities, there is a system to reduce how much walking you need to do to get where you want to go but for this whole game you will be walking from point A to point B. There are several points where the next event isn't obvious, searching for them adds to the travel time.Movement is handled with either mouse or 'wasd'. This is an issue as clicking on some things is hard due to their size while using pure 'wasd' will end up hurting your hand. And when using 'wasd' the fidelity feels off as when the character rotates direction 180 degrees they rotate in 90 degree chunks adding several frames of lag to the movement.The walk speed is a fixed rate for the whole game and it's not fast. This makes backtracking through large areas like cities painful. Eventually I settled on using both mouse and 'wasd' to minimize hand pain."

,Not Recommended,433920,33709146,Posted: 21 July,all,stingstungme,"This is beyond a shadow of a doubt my LEAST favorite Aveyond game.  I think I own around 7 of them. The others are awesome. This one is torturous.Pros: It's Aveyond. Cute characters. Nice story. Beautiful graphics. Characters in reserve earn xp.Cons: Too confusing. As with all Aveyond games, you have to zig zag all over the place. Not a problem but without maps included it is hellacious trying to figure out how to get back to a previous location. Between the ferry, mist portal and ship....I don't know which way is up. With previous Aveyonds, you took your ship to a location and maybe had to navigate a woods or two.I've spent most of my time trying traveling and googling 'how do I get to (insert town name'.More cons: Game is very skimpy as far as coins go. Drops from fights wouldn't be so bad if the weapons and armors weren't so expensive. With previous Aveyonds, I never ran out of money.If you're looking for your typical fun Aveyond game, this isn't it.If I wanted to be this frustrated and clueless with a game, I would have played Nancy Drew instead.EDIT: Forgot to mention 6/10 times I minimize the game to consult strategy guide or Google, the game glitches and my mouse cursor blinks and disappears.If I am in a doorway or near stairs, my char will automatically walk up and down the stairs, or back and forth through the doorway and I can't stop him.If I'm out in the open, the char will randomly walk in 1 direction until he can't any longer. I cannot move him with my mouse. Keyboard commands still work. I have no option but to save and restart the game."

What I love about this series is the mixture of rich story and humor, paired with classic RPG elements from the old console days.That said, in Aveyond 4, you start out as a villain. It is quite fun and a worthwhile story. I highly recommend playing this! =)"

If you've never played them before, you'll still enjoy this one! Its a shorter RPG, or at least it feels like it, and the writing and humor are wonderful. The ""fast travel"" isn't really fast, which is kind of a problem, and so there's a lot of walking with no real way to make it go faster, A few of the puzzles and sidequests are a bit obtuse at times, but thankfully the creator's website has the answers to just about all of them, if you don't feel like buying the strategy guide.A few of the jokes will be funnier if you've played previous installments but this is largely unconnected to the previous three games in the series and easy to enjoy if you're new to the series. (Just remember, if you do go back to play the other games, that the first two are nearly ten years old now and the age shows.)"

76561198123765531,Recommended,433920,21192200,"Posted: 13 February, 2016",all,Someone Wicked,"20 hours in and I've finished my first playthrough.  I loved this game!  I'm a big fan of the whole Aveyond series.  This one ties in nicely to the other games, but you can definitely play it without having played the others - there's just little bonus jokes and such that you only get if you've played all the games.  The dialog is funny, clever, cute and well-written.  All the grammar and spelling is correct (one of my pet peeves is games with incorrect grammar and spelling, the Aveyond ones are safe from that).This is an RPG Maker game with very cute sprites.  The sprites are very nice, and you can actually tell which sprite is which character.  The art (the non-RPG maker generated art) is lovely; the character art in particular was great, with very expressive faces (that actually looked like realistic emotions instead of something out of a Looney Toon).I recommend this to anyone with a good sense of humor, and anyone who likes RPGs.  If you liked the other Aveyond games, you'll almost certainly enjoy this.  If you liked Cthulhu Saves the World, you'll like this (IMO this is better than Cthulhu - the art is nicer and you can actually follow the maps).  Try the demo, it's a good representation of the game play."

I even caught myself chuckling a few times.

Fun stuff, cute game."
76561198192001819,Recommended,433920,34754321,Posted: 5 September,all,SachikoUchiha,"As a life-long fan of the Aveyond series, I can say with certainty that this is an incredible game. However, it's not an Aveyond game. Yes there are references here and there in conversation, but the only thing that makes this game by definition an Aveyond game is the presence of the holy land of Aveyond itself. You could change the name of that place and erase the 5 or 6 references you get in passing and you wouldn't even know it was part of the series. Like I said before I don't think this is a bad game, but it just doesn't have the feeling of being on a proper quest to save the world. In every Aveyond prior to this, there has been a real threat of an evildoer plotting some grand plan, and you are sent on a quest to stop this from happening, running into all sorts of plot twists, tricky puzzles and difficult enemies along the way. In this game,you start off on a quest to find your dog, and even when the game seems to pull out the dramatic plot of an evil demon,the main characters brush it off as a joke, leaving the whole plot lacking to feel of a real, important goal.Another aspect of the game that I believe sets it aside for the rest of the series is the amount of consistencies of the series that were broken:There is little to no mention of Thais or the PendragonsThe menus work in a completely different way (i.e. no numbers on health/mana bars when using items, an individual equip menu for every character in their profile instead of one equip menu for everyone, the unappealing new layout of the home menu (especially when trying to use keys to quickly navigate the screen) etc.)New interactions with spells (i.e. a spell may hit a random number of times, hit a random enemy/random enemies, hit the hero party etc).Plently of memorable item, monster and character sprites were removed (which seems petty, but alongside everything else it kind of just sealed the deal)I feel like any one of these things could be implemented without alienating the game from the series, but all 3 along with others I might not have said are definitely a rather large shock.As I have already eluded to, I also believe this game relies too much on it's comedic value to hold the player's interest in the plot (and the game as a whole). I had my fair share of good laughs during the Orbs of Magic series (usually during exchanges between Te'ijal and Galahad), and yes they made the games all the more enjoyable and added a sense of personality to the characters, but what keeps me going back to those games (as well as Aveyond 1 and 2) is the sense of completion I get every time I complete a quest, defeat a difficult enemy or ultimately finish the game. But because of all the satire and lack of suspense as to the final boss' plans, I found myself at the end of this game without even realising it. The feeling of approaching the climax of the story (i.e. the final showdown to stop your enemy's plan once and for all) just wasn't there. The fact that so many quests are left out of your journal for you to figure out on your own (i.e.the whole ordeal involving the two wizards and their towers) didn't help either, as I went into the final fight fully expecting futher story development involving those side quests that I had assumed would come up later. (Please note that I am not saying the unwritten side quests were a negative addition. They are a great source of replay value and add that extra sense of completion to the game. However they should probably be pushed further to the side so as to not interfere with the apparent progression of the main storyline, or else they may actually withdraw from the sense of completion as it did with me).Another note that I should make is that the number of highly problematic bugs in the game (at least at the time I played it) is rather alarming. Some characters don't show up during cutscenes, images may be doubled (i.e.a tile showing glowing eyes in a hollow tree shows a duplicate beneath itself on the misty mountain as the start of the game). And even carrying certain items interfered with menu interactions.I love the Aveyond series dearly, and I did thoroughly enjoy this game. I did get a good sense of completion for all the quests I finished and secrets i found. However, it just doesn't fit the epic fantasy adventure RPG role that the series demands of any addition. I find it to be more of a sort of parody of the series. My overall rating for the game (based on satisfaction) would be about 6/10."

Based on reviews I decided to start with this game and was not disappointed. There were some times when I didn't know where to go so I had to Google but I do that with pretty much every game. If you are looking for a fun throwback RPG with a lot of humor, give this one a try. I will definitely be playing the rest of the games within the Aveyond series."

That's not to say it isn't an okay game, but it didn't live up to the expectations I have come to have for an Aveyond game. It was a bit disappointing.Pros:- The characters are well done. Boyle makes for a fun and interesting ""hero"". The side characters are just as interesting and the dialog is well written..- The art is, as usual, beautiful. Each location has so many little details that make the map come alive.- The mechanics are great. Each character has their own set of unique skills. Changing one active party member for another can have a real impact in a fight.- The humor is on point.- Lots of little easter eggs / throwbacks to previous Aveyond games.Cons:- The quests were all over the place, to the point it became confusing in parts. While a game can be boring if it is too linear, this game would have benefitted from more clear direction.- The story started out strong, but fell apart toward the middle.- Backtracking. A lot of tedious back and forth, zig zagging all over. It got pretty boring.- The locations, while beautiful, felt small and cramped. The overall world map felt like each continent / island was stuck together on a too-small map at the end. Where previous games felt open and vast, this one felt small and squished.- The ending. No spoilers, but it was a letdown. I kept saying to myself ""That's it?"". Pretty disappointing.Overall, the game started out strong but seemed to lose it's way around the middle. I enjoyed it for the most part, but I felt as though the game had potential to be better than it was. If you love the Aveyond games, by all means get the game. Maybe wait until it's on sale though."
,Recommended,433920,34427905,Posted: 22 August,all,Rotu,"This is the 4th game in the Aveyond series and quite frankly the best. It's the first game I beat without cheats, and I loved every hour of it (note: my gametime is inaccurate I may or may not have left this open >.>) The goodie caves in this game don't break it, they help. And yes, I KNOW it looks RPG makery but it looks better than the previous games and I enjoyed looking at all the new designs and exploring the new world. Also, if for nothing else, get it for the story line and dialogue. Surprsingly hiLARious whether you expect a giggle or not, and the plot itself is super engaging. If you're not used to Aveyond games, this may be tricky for you. But I'd definitely buy this one if you've been thinking about the series, and even if you've already played it? Still get it. There are references to the older games in the series and let's be real I love this game and so should everyone else."
