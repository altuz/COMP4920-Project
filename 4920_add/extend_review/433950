I want more control over my ship, like 4 directions for example.[This is new review / upvote]On original review, I was not talked about the part that I'm using laptop keyboard to play the game which is not supposed to be.And just few hours, Creator of this one contacted me and give advice to use controller instead, and we talked about more option (like keyboard) to control your ship, which is very nice.With the charming of this game, and customer support alone is already worth an Up vote. Hope to see keyboard support in near future!"

A few hours later, I realise I am still playing it.So then... About that sequel?"

,Recommended,433950,29452155,Posted: 23 January,all,Dr. Mircow,"Bit Blaster XL is a retro-stylised fast-paced arcade shoot ‘em up developed by a small indie developer.Graphically, it is clearly an homage to the first generation of videogames from the ‘80s. The visuals are primitive, but fit with the themes of the game, and the same can be said about its unsophisticated sound effects and retro-y soundtrack. Frankly, there is not a lot to say about them as they speak for themselves.As the title might suggest, the gameplay involves controlling a ship which cannot stop and has to blast as many obstacles on the screen without touching any of them, their own laser blasts, or the edges of the screen. You can collect green blobs as ammo each time you destroy an obstacle and pick up a variety of outright crazy power-ups to enhance your survival. When your ship gets destroyed, you rinse and repeat. Other ships with different statistics (speed, shields, firepower, etc.) do become available by unlocking them with accumulated coins you might have collected from previous playthroughs. The goal is straightforward. Aim for the highest score by surviving the longest.The controls are simple and intuitive, which is good news for a game like Bit Blast XL that focuses on quick reflexes. You use WASD or the arrow keeps to maneuver the ship and the Spacebar to drop a limited supply of bombs to eliminate everything on screen. The latter is a nifty new ability added after the 3.0 patch that gives the player some room to breathe once in a while (I will explain soon), although it does make the difficulty a tad easier than in the original version. You can also toggle in the options whether you want the ship to shoot automatically or manually if you want to preserve ammo.But beware! Beneath Bit Blast XL’s simplistic look lies a game which entails a good degree of swiftness, strategy and patience. While it is easy to get into, the difficulty surges over time with more obstacles and even hostile ships showing up on screen. Things heat up rapidly and the screen gets very cluttered. It gets pretty crazy, almost as if you are under LSD.In the long run, playing Bit Blaster XL is like playing a conglomerated version of Space Invaders, Geometry Wars and Luftrausers. There is no denying that the game got a lot of inspiration and borrowed elements from the abovementioned games, but its execution is nearly-perfect. I cannot see any critical flaws with its gameplay, except that it might get tiresome after a long session. However, there is some element of addictiveness to it, especially if you are an OCD person.In conclusion, Bit Blaster XL is a genuinely fun arcade game where you can play for as long as you want. Got 10 minutes to spare and have nothing else to do? Boot it up and blast everything in your path! There is no story nor pretentious vibe to it. Just pure fun gameplay like in the old days. The price tag, even at full price, makes this game a must-have. Highly recommend it! Personally, I suppose my only regret is having other priorities, as my playtime for such a fun little game is criminally low.Bit Blaster XL is simply quite a…blast!http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=789141454"

The game has a very simple but effective design, and the variety of power-ups puts this game above many of its classic counterparts. I also consider this to be on par with Geometry Wars, if not better.Like games such as Downwell, and the great arcade games of the early-mid 80s, this game has an incredible ability to put you ""in the zone"". My first two runs frequently end in the first minute. Then something clicks, I shift into gear, ignore the distractions around me, and I have a...blast.

,Recommended,433950,30175734,Posted: 25 February,all,Kikiclark,"This game is criminally cheap.Like, this isn't even a joke, or a 'wow I really liked this game'.This is practically stealing. Especially seeing as I got on a **SALE**. It was half off. That's literally half an Euro spent.This game has 8 ships (Unless I miscounted), and I find this game brilliant just for this sole aspect;They have personality. I don't know how to explain it, this game, a throwback to all the 80s space shooter games, managed to give something basic, like, 50 pixels max ships, personality.Each one of them has an interesting balance of Speed and Shields. But also, the soundtrack.You start with your basic ship, right? And you play, you need to get 5 coins, because the second ship is unlocked via the semi-uncommon drops, aka, the aforementioned coins.And in that short period of time, like the 5-10 minutes or so, you're just getting the hang of the game, and bobbing your head to the tunes.I'm a sucker for good chiptunes, and this game does them right.Now, I thought it would be just the one song, on all the ships. Boy was I wrong. Every ship has a song tied to them, akin to a kind of remix of the others, but it's remixed in such a way, that it indirectly, portrays the style of game you're playing at the moment.For example;Let's say you play the second ship, which is kind of the 'speedy/one hit death' style ship. The track changes from the first one, to a faster, more upbeat one.Or the third ship, it changes from the first one, to a remix of it, which goes slower, and deeper, but still hitting it right, so it sounds good.Now, the controls, it's one of ""those"" games. It's really basic.Left, Right, you rotate your ship. No up and down, just, rotating it like a tank.Boost, Slow down, does what it says on the tin.And well, Shoot, and Bomb, one does the pew pew, the other does the big boom, when you're in a tight spot, clearing the whole screen (Alongside coins, which you need, so take care!)Whilst basic controls, I think this game is most enjoyable on a controller, it just feels right on it.I have no downsides for this game, except maybe that you can't change the music volume or SFX volume in options(Not like you'd need to honestly, it's pretty nicely balanced)And that some of the power-ups have weird lettering. Each power-up is a bubble you pick up, and it changes the weapon you have.But for some, let's say the piercing shot, instead of ""P"" for piercing, it has ""T""... For 'through'.Or the Blast (Which is a short-range shotgun-esque blast) and the Scatter (Which is just 3 'scattered' shots).Also, the D-pad doesn't work, which is just kinda bizzare.All in all?WOW, this game is a steal.Seriously, it's so arcade-y and fun. Plus, free soundtrack under the DLC tabs, PLUS, achievements, AND PLUS, it has trading cards.I greatly recommend you guys to just buy this game, if you like it in the slightest, it's so cheap."
,Recommended,433950,32309139,Posted: 9 June,all,Endyo,"Bit Blaster XL is certainly easy to overlook given a quick look at the screenshots or gameplay, but I have to say I haven't paid so little money for so much fun in a long time.  For the price of what you'd pay these days for 30ish seconds in an arcade, you can buy this endlessly enjoyable arcade-inspired classic.  On the surface it look like it might be a twin-stick shooter, but you actually use a single analog of a gamepad and have to contend with the fact that you are always moving forward.  An interesting challenge for those used to games like Geometry Wars where control is very precise.  It also defaults to an “auto fire” mode which I quickly turned off since there is an ammo element to the game, but I think it does make the game slightly more accessible, which is always a good thing.What really sets Bit Blaster XL apart from its contemporaries is that it also implements some roguelite mechanics in that, throughout your play session, you're collecting coins to unlock more ships with different characteristics.  They vary in size, speed, firingpower, starting shields (health) and starting bombs.  At first they seem to be more like 'sidegrades' than upgrades, but as you unlock more they clearly become much more capable and allow you to get further – that is, if you're able to control their faster speed.  The best part of this is that each ship has its own musical theme when you use it and they're all pretty solid chiptune tracks.  All of this adds up to a great incentive to play more of what would normally just be a game that centered around chasing high scores.For the base price of 99 cents, I don't know that this can really be beat as far as the sheer value and how much fun it is.  It's definitely a game I can see myself dipping in to whenever I have a spare 10 or 15 minutes and just want to see if I can knock out my high score.  I fully recommend picking it up even at full price (because who can't spare a dollar) not only because it's a good time, but because a developer like this needs to be encouraged to continue their efforts and dive in to development of even more robust games of this quality.If you'd like to see more of my reviews, check out my curator page here:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/EndyoGaming#curation"

The only real goal is getting a high score.Essentially, the whole game plays on a single scren.If you hit the edge of the screen, you die. The primary mechanic or novelty is the shooting mechanic. While it is toggle-able, you are constantly shooting which obviously depletes ammo stores - which you replenish by pickups dropped when enemies are killed. There are various temporary gun upgrades sort of reminiscent ofContra(not sure why that game comes to mind, but it does).Look, are you going to dump hours and hours into this? Probably not. But for about a buck, you get a pretty wicked game to pass the controller around with friends and try to beat each other's score."

No, but that's okay, because the quality far exceeds the price tag.If you're familiar with Asteroids, then you'll understand this game. Fly through space, shoot stuff, and make that score number grow. That's it.Now, to liven it up a bit, there's a ton of different weapons and ships to unlock and choose from. Pretty cool, right? It is. BBXL isn't perfect, though: the auto-propulsion and turning radius of the ships makes controlling your craft a little difficult. Precision shots are hard to pull off, and when there's a ton of stuff on screen, it can become very difficult to make out exactly what's happening. Adding to all of that is the ammo system, which technically makes sense, and while adding a slight sense of strategy to the game, can become hectic in later parts of the game.But seriously, it's fifty cents on sale. This is a game I can see myself popping on every now and then, determined to break my old high score. And isn't that what the old greats were all about?"

May be darken the colors for the meteor-looking bullets a little bit? Or is this aspect of the game purposely done to troll users.

,Recommended,433950,24036181,"Posted: 2 July, 2016",all,Party Lemon,"Due to the recent summer sale, I found myself digging around in the ""cheap cheap"" part of the store and I came across a few titles that I decided to give a try because hey, 49 cents is pretty good for small games. I found Bit Blaster XL. This is a quaint little pixle-based space shooter that throws bullets at you faster and faster over time. You start out with the first basic ship and gain the ability to buy new ones with coins you recieve as drops from kills. There are a nice amount of ships for the game, since the game is so small, you dont really need many anyway. You will be focused on not only your score, but unlocking more ships as well as the achievements the game has to offer. Do i recommend this game? Yes. This game is a nice little time killer that is really addicting when you really get into it. At the time of writing this, the game is on sale for 49 cents but the original price is only 99 cents. I also recommend the game at that price as well. A dollar is a fair price in my opinion for this cute little game. Also, the music is sweet too!"

Handles like Luftrausers - you only steer your craft left or right, it is always moving forward and always firing.  Enemies drop ammo pickups to replenish your limited ammo (though you always have your basic gun, running out simply takes away your active weapon powerup) and coins which can be spent on new craft.Plays like a mix of Luftrausers and Asteroids with the former's array of different handling craft but a simple, enjoyable gameplay loop where a run can be over in seconds due to a silly mistake, but restarting is very fast for another try.Controls are tight and every death feels like YOUR fault, not the game's.For the price it's fantastic."
,Recommended,433950,23975704,"Posted: 30 June, 2016",all,KidwithSmurf,"*Note: This Review is based off using a PC Keyboard and Mouse for v3.11*Ever play Asteroids back in the day and loved every second of it? Then this game is for you! With its Asteroid style gameplay, you'll be sure to love this! However, even though the game is magnificent there are some slight problems which could be fixed to make it even better which I'll outline in my Pros and Cons below:Pros:♦ Hours of gameplay for the low price of $1 (You definitely get your money's worth)♦ Has Trading Cards♦ Awesome Number of Achievements gotten for just playing the game (You don’t have to do anything special to get these, just play the game)♦ Controls seem to be responsive and work as intended (Pressing the button seems to do what is intended and work very well)♦ Decent variation and number of powerups (Not one powerup seems similar to the last and their seems to be a decent number to always keep the game interesting)♦ Decent variation of enemies (This is decent because  when you progress it doesn’t feel like you are versing the same select enemies over and over again as more types seem to come in the longer you are alive)♦ Nice number of balanced unlockable playable ships♦ Eargasmic Music and Sound Effects that fit the bullet hell scene and make it feel intense whilst you are playing and makes you want to keep playing♦ Graphics are stunning for the genre♦ Everything seems balanced and works off skill more than the power of something (For example, a better ship or weapon upgrade doesn’t always mean you’ll do better, as the game relies on skill)♦ Two modes to suite everyone’s playstyle (Auto-Fire and Non-Auto-Fire which means if you want to really test your skill you can or if you want to casually play you can)♦ Old School look and feel is on point (If you ever played old school pixel, bullet hell games, this is a very good representation. For example, if you played Asteroids, you will love this)♦ Very Good at being both a casual or uncasual game (If you have spare time and just want to casually play something this game works perfectly or if you want to go for a highscore and beat your friends this works perfectly too)♦ Difficulty seems scaled correctly (I say this as the longer you play the harder it gets without being too easy at the start or too hard at the end. It feels like you ease into harder stages without actually realising which is decent)♦ PC Option Menu that seems to work (Decent for what it is)♦ Remapable controls (This is amazing as we can easily and quickly change the keys to whatever button we want)Cons:♦ No incentive to switch powerups unless needing extra ammo (This is annoying as I didn’t really feel ammo was a problem and some powerups suited me better than others, so why switch?)♦ Powerups don’t stack (This seems weird as I would have thought that collecting more than one of the same powerup would have stacked and upgraded it to a certain point, instead collecting more more than one of the same powerup only gives you ammo and nothing else)♦ Some people who don’t like this gamestyle may find it very repetitive (This is because there is no levels and not much variation from each time you click play)♦ Steam highscores don't seem to go off mode or ship (This is really bad as someone can play any ship and auto-fire and be registered on Steam with the same score as someone who played non-auto-fire. Steam highscores should be done like ingame highscores by fire mode and ship)Overall, the game is one of the best Pixelated, Old School, Bullet Hell games that I’ve ever played on Steam. Even though there are lots of cons, the pros still outweigh the cons as the cons are only minor things which I believe would help improve the game. Therefore, if you like Old School games like Asteroids, then you’ll love this and at the low price of $1.00, you can’t go wrong!PS: It also seems the Developers read the reviews, which is good. I had listed in my Cons things like obvious Steam highscores hacking and no PC resolution mode. Since listing these in my Cons the obviously hacked highscores have been removed and a PC resolution mode has been added. Amazing game and amazing Developers!"

It is similar to several differnent classic arcade games that I have played, and I am a sucker for retro games. I have been really enjoying the game, and have even been catching myself trying again and again just trying to better my high score and place higher on the leaderboards.Controls are simple. Your little ship moves automatically, with you being able to control its turning, as well as having control over a boost that depletes and recharges over time. Your ship fires automatically as well, and there are many different power-ups that spawn on the screen that you can pick up that will change your weapon. You weapon uses ammo which can be reloaded by shooting enemies and picking up their little green balls. All is simple, even death. There are no lives and if you get shot without your sheilds, you're done for!The game also has a little currency system where enemies may occasionally drop gold coins, which you can use to purchase new ships!In my opinion, This game is super well made, and as of the 1.1 version, all of the bugs below have been FIXED from what I have been able to witness. The developer gets an A+ for responding to reviews and fixing these bugs in a timely manner. Kudos to you Dev. :)+ (FIXED) While using a controller, a ""ghost"" of myself would spawn with me and remain motionless while i fly around. If the ghost took damage, it would end the game for me.+ (FIXED) The ""H"" power-up (Homing projectile) could be picked up but not fire a single homing shot. Only the basic weapon would remain active.+ (FIXED) Enemy's red projectiles would sometimes do much more damage then they should, taking down multiple layers of your sheild instead of just one layer. I could be wrong in which some projectiles are meant to deal more damage, but I haven't seen any consistencies in damage output by certain enemies. (Bug perhaps? Would be nice to get some feedback from the devs on this.)Main thing I would like to see in a future update would be more products in the shop. There is a total of only seven ships in the game, and when you buy them, there is nothing left to buy and gold then becomes obsolete, unless you want to collect lots of gold, like me! I would love to see additions to the shop to spend my gold on. (i.e. More ships, power-ups to unlock, ship appearences, rocket trails, enemy appearences, etc.)This game has huge potential to become something even better than it already is. The Developer is super positive and proactive on fixing bugs, and I cannot wait to see what else could be in store for the future. I definitely would recommend this game to anyone who loves simple, casual, challenging indie games. This game is certainly worth the 99 cents!"

,Recommended,433950,23974888,"Posted: 30 June, 2016",all,Bumblebugbee3,"Bit Blaster XL is a perfect example of how to make a great little indie-game.  First pick a classic genre, in this case space shooters.  Pick a gimmick or two to make your game stand out from other similar titles.  Finally, give the player a some motivation to continue playing beyond just for high-scores.  One easy way to achieve this is via a light progression system.  Bring all that together like this game does and you're destined for success.The developer's motto ""live, die, retry"" becomes quite apparent very quickly.  Bit Blaster is a space shooter similar the classic Asteroids.  There are various meteors, bombs, and spaceships coming at you from both sides of the screen.  The longer you survive the more stuff gets thrown at you.  Its usually not much more than two or three minutes till you're overwhelmed and you're ship is destroyed.  You'll want to keep jumping right back into the action because with the aid of the various weapons you'll know there is potential to do better.The weapon and ammo system is one of the features that really stands out about this game.  You have one ammo base that carries across for all the different weapons including your standard gun.  In order to get more ammo you'll either have to pick it up from destroying the objects around you or grabing new weapons.  Once you pick up a weapon you're stuck with it unless your ship gets hit, runs out of ammo, or you pick up a different weapon.  There are classic weapons like rapid fire, scattershot, and homing missiles as well as unique ammo that either explodes, bounces, or tears through multiple enemies.To help keep you motivated you earn coins as you play which will unlock you new ships.  The first couple ships offer a specific selling points such as extra speed or multiple shields.  As you unlock the later ships they are pretty much straight up upgrades of previous models.  By the end of the game there will probably just one or two clear favorites you usually stick with if you choose to keep playing.  There is some incentive to go back to the other ships as each has their own leader-boards for high-scores.Either you like retro space shooters or you don't.  If you do Bit Blaster is definitely worth checking out.  The various weapons and ships make it quite an enjoyable game that can be hard to put down.  Since it is rather light you may not be very motivated to keep playing after unlocking all the ships but you'll still have had enough fun up to that point to have made the purchase worth wild.  There are bits that need blasting, how much more need I say."

,Recommended,433950,20748963,"Posted: 25 January, 2016",all,Aro,"Though incredibly simple, this is pobably the best game I have ever purchased on Steam for less than £1.00.Bit Blaster XLis a space themed shoot-em-up, a concept almost as old as video games themselves so you know exactly what you're buying and thus I don't need to explain any further. Despite the fact that it is a theme that has been done to death, this is surprisingly a lot of fun to play and has proven to be incredibly addictive.Your ammunition rapidly depletes as a result of your ship constantly auto-firing forcing you to collect the ammo power-ups throughout all of the hazards on screen, which becomes very challenging after a certain point in time. Collectables include coins to unlock other ships in your arsenal and different temporary weapons, ranging from rapid fire, bouncing projectiles, explosives and even a light saber esque weapon, plus many more.As your points increase, so does the difficulty, things become very hectic after the 10,000 point margin always keeping you on your toes. One word of advice though, if you're going to play this, I would highly recommend using a controller, it's tough to maneuver using a keypad.I couldn't recommend this game highly enough, especially since it's incredibly cheap. There is much, much worse you could be using your £0.79 for. The awesome soundtrack alone is worth more than that!"

,Recommended,433950,22895400,"Posted: 10 May, 2016",all,Nuts,"Bit Blaster XL is an arcade game in the style of Asteroids and Geometry Wars.This game can get pretty brutal at points, especially at the beginning when you don’t have very good ships. You collect coins and can buy new ships that move faster, have more shields, or fire faster. They vary enough that you can find the one you are most comfortable using. However, most of the time you will just end up using Ship 7 or 8 as they have the most shield, fire the quickest, and move the fastest.There are also weapon pickups that change the way you fire. Some cause explosions, some give you a shotgun style blast, some make you fire incredibly fast. The amount of pickups does become a bit redundant as there are two pickups that are really overpowered and make the others pointless.  You will end up only using about 3 different pickups.One of the biggest problems with this game is the controls. Using a controller still made it hard to be accurate at points and the keyboard was even worse. The ships move way to quick at points and make it hard to be precise. I’m not sure if it was just me but this ended up infuriating me at points. Another problem is how slow the score rises. If you go for every achievement, getting to 75k can take a while. You just don’t get enough points. This is quite disheartening when you think you are doing really well and you have destroyed a load of enemies to find out that you only have 15k points.I honestly didn’t really enjoy my time playing this game for the reasons that i gave above, however i know that some people will enjoy this game.  It is quite fun if you played it to kill 10 minutes every now and then, but as someone who played this for a 5 hour sitting one time, it might start to bug the hell out of you, If you think this looks fun, go for it. Its pretty cheap and you will get your moneys worth in the end. 5/10."

You can pick up weapons that each have different variety just like in Contra. You can unlock more ships that have different play styles like more speed, smaller/bigger, and more health. You can also pick up health/shields and boosters that used when you speed up or slowing down.

And this game reminds me of those years. Bit Blaster XL is a throwback in every way. Shooting for points? Check. Powerups? Check. Methods to rack up high scores? Check. Gimmick to keep you comming back? You betcha. This games gimmick is simple. Your ship is on auto-pilot both in acceleration and shooting. You move left and right as well as use turbo and brakes, although you will never stop dead unless you die. You also have an ammo meter that you must build up with pellets enemies drop.

I usually don't like games where firing is automatic but Bit Blaster incorperates this in to the core of the game mechanic so instead of being a shortcut (this started life as a touch screen game) it is actually part of what makes it great.

It has pixelated graphics (the good type of pixelated graphics), and different music for each different space ship. I'm personally a sucker for any game with unlockable characters/abilities and powerups, this game has both. Also, the game has a variety of ways to control the spaceship; the mouse, arrows, wasd, and you can use controllers, this is a nice little touch so that anyone can play the game the way they please. Overall, I liked this game, there are a few downsides though; even with the powerups the gameplay is very simple, making it repetitive. The controls are good, but the way the spaceship works isn't as good, you can't strafe, you can only shoot where your moving towards and you can't stop your spaceship, although you can slow it down. I think adding completely different game modes, and in those new game modes adding a different movement system could help make the game better.The game is relatively cheap. I would recommend this game to casual gamers, people with a thirst for high scores, or people that just don't have a lot of time on their hands and just wanna play for a bit."

You have a spaceship with limited ammo. The trick is: better weapons needs more ammo. Even without combo point system you had to destroy someting constantly, because every dead enemy drops ammo and you need it to feed a weapon. If you're out of ammo, you're back to a standard pew pew laser.It's a very simple, but effective mechanic. It's always risk vs reward, so you can play safe, or beat a crap out of hi-score. Game is really hard, because most weapons shoots only in the direction that you are flying (like in Berzerk), but enemies of course are all over you and can aim. So it is a challenge, like any other arcade style shooter, but not unfair and I feel I can handle it.Have fun.---------------------------------------------------------------EDIT: Last upgrade is really nice. More powerups (including new shelds), ability to speed up, enemies respawns more often. I feel I'm dying much faster, but scoring faster, too."

It has enough unique gameplay elements that it doesn't feel like a clone.The problems I have with this game are primarily with the way you progress. You get new ships by getting a certain number of tokens. The problem here is that the tokens seem to be awarded arbitrarily and it just keeps a continuous count. Some games you will get a token right away while others you may make record score and still be lucky to even see a single one. It makes it feel like you are just grinding the game for tokens and not really being rewarded for doing well.

This game is perfect for that!+On-going dev support: The game is on version 3 after 1.5 years.  That's rare but awesome for a relatively short game.+Powerup variety: Took me quite a while to remember what half of the powerup letters meant without looking at the in game cheat sheet. I stuck with the wide shot bursts or long beam type weapons, and got good scores that way.+Enemy variety: Plenty of enemy types available as time progresses.Neutral:~Had to slow down ship often: If I travelled at normal or fast speed most of the time, then I would most likely lose at least one shield.~Semi addicting score chasingtrying to beat my prior scores for my latest ship or overall was somewhat addicting for a time.Cons;~Meaningful ship variety: After unlocking all of the ships, there's only like 2 that I'd consider using anyways.-Short overall playtime: I didn't expect to get much playtime out of this, but if that matters to you, then I wouldn't buy this game."

The soundtrack is outstanding and plus you can get it for free which is just awesome. Each ability is unique and useful (beside one, in my opinion, the trail, it's just isn't good compared to others.)The cons I have with this game is that 1. The bounce ability bullets look exactly like the bullets that are shot from certain enemies. 2. I wish the you're high score is displayed when you're playing the game not just after you die. 3. when you brake it uses the boost fuel. Those cons are very minor and can be easily fixed.

You are one of the last lines of defense that your planet has. You step in the rocket and see the platform slowly move further away from you. And then you see them. The asteroids. You start firing at them, destroying them and defending earth as much as you can. You see your first support from earth in a glowing, colorful ball. You fly your ship towards it, to find out it is an upgrade for your gun. You install it and find out its power. After a while, earth asks you to start collecting coin-like alien material that, once back down on earth, can be used to upgrade your ship. Sometime later, you send a packet of about 5 coins down to earth, and in return you get another ship. Smaller, faster, it has faster firing capabilites and is better in many ways. You defend earth with all your might, recieving support in the form of new spaceships and gun upgrades when you see the aliens ships firing towards you. You start firing towards them too, trying to dodge the asteroids as much as you can. As you slowly become more focused on the situation, you start to find out how to fly effectively and how to dodge asteroids to only focus on the spaceships. You realize your entire team has been taken out by the aliens.You are earth's last hope.You are the Bit Blaster.(That was a story I wrote for the plot of the game: don't presume it is official, that is just what I like to imagine it being :])Overall, this is a very good game for its value. It has great music, is a decent difficulty and has a lot of features that take a little bit of time to learn.

They often change the way the game is played in ways both large and small. with some, the best strategy is to be calm and fire conservatively like with the blue explosive power up, while with others, the best strategy is to spray and pray, like with the richocheting pink power up. I quickly found ones that I prefered. My favorite was always the purple one that acted like a short range shot gun.Of course, minor critisisms became more pronounced the longer I played. It's often very easy to take multiple hits in quick succession for ships with shields due to the lack of invinsibility frames. The scoreboard is pretty meaningless and hard to get to considering this is a game where the only goal is to get a high score.In fact, after a while, the game gets pretty samey. Since the score is such an after thought, the only reason to play the game is for the game's own sake. Once every round of bit blasting feels like the last one, it starts to get boring. After the first few ship unlocks, it takes too long to get the next ship for that to be a proper motivation to keep playing.Still, for all it's faults, I had a decent ammount of fun with it. For the price of a dollar, I think it's worth a try, especially if it's on sale.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ship combat is not Bit Blaster's strength. Bullets only eject from the front of the ship, and the ship can only go forward with an incredibly large turning radius. It's clunky. That's not to say that you can't get good at it, it's just not fun to get good at.What is Bit Blaster XL's strength then? well, it has some kick♥♥♥♥♥music. That alone kept me going for longer than I would normally have.I think the real strength of Bit Blaster is its power up system. Each power up is completely unique and has the potential to be completely game changing. Sure, there are the mundane ones that just make you fire faster or also shoot from your butt, but there are also the ones that make large balls the same size as your ship bounce off the walls of the screen, filling the entire thing with your bullets, or the ones that make explosives that blow up everything in front of your ship, or the one that gives you a short range laser that makes you have to get up in the business of anythin you want to kill.They're pretty sweet, I'll admit.Still, it's not enough to carry the game for me. The terrible controls really hinder the game, and the space ships that I unlocked before quitting were pretty lack luster. Maybe someone else will find it more fun than I did."

That includes me.While the pixel art reminds me of other SEM, the gameplay doesn´t, and it sucks that I have to say that.Turning the ship itself can be slow and clunky, but that wouldn´t really be a problem if there wasn´t an ammo limit.I feel that the ammo breaks the game. It makes it even slower.I feel like a faster mode without ammo limits should be added. That would make this an intense, hard but rewarding game.There are more ships you can unlock with coins you get by playing, and there are power-ups when in game, wich makes this a little bit more of an anjoyable experience.Also, the music can get really repetitive and annoying. More music options would be great.Other than that, if you want to kill some time, go for it. It´s low price and the dev. appreciates every kind of feedback he can get.7/10"

,Recommended,433950,22656515,"Posted: 26 April, 2016",all,HEY!!!,"I had some negative criticism about this game at first, and although some of the problems I have with it still stand, The dev Nickervision has been extremely cool about taking my critique seriously and adding things to the game based on my suggestions. That's something I've never ever experienced before, so props to him.As for the game its a pretty simple score attack asteroids clone with some interesting powerups, a little variation in enemies, a few different ships, and some pretty jammin music.The game is fun to play as a casual arcade game, and for $1 you can't beat the value, so I'd recommend it. However there are a few areas where I think this game falls short / could be improved.-Overall the game feels very slow. I’m sure some users like this / are used to this and so I do not necessarily think it has to be changed for the main game mode, but I personally like fast paced games, and I would like a ""Hard Mode"" or ""Super Speed"" mode where everything is faster, your ship, the enemies and how fast the enemies appear on screen. Also I think the biggest difficulty is how cramped the screen gets when it fills up with enemies, for this new mode it would be cool to see the screen expanded so you had more movement space.-There is not too much diversity in what you are shooting at, I have not gotten too far so there may be more enemies later, but the game is hard enough that you will spend most of your time shooting at circles and the occasional ship before dying and starting over. Since I'm going to be spending most of my time in the first part of the game it should be engaging.-The powerups still feel a little lacking to me, some suggestions I have for new ones are: lightning, plasma beam, multiple guided missiles, sin wave ray? My favorite powerups are the lightsaber and the one that shoots energy bombs, because they feel unique, the rest are just slight variations on the starting gun.-With powerups I would also like to see some kind of tier or upgrade system. players want to be able to upgrade their weapons and hopefully be overpowered, this could be implemented in another mode perhaps where along with ammo dead enemies also drop another type of pickup that upgrades your current weapon if you pick up enough. Also I think primary and secondary upgrades should be separate, you should be able to have the shield or magnet with another weapon.-The coin system feels lacking, I would rather pick up 20 coins per run and need 500 to get the next ship than maybe pick up 1 coin and only need 10. If i play a round and get no coins, it feels unsatisfying, also different tiers of coins would be fun, red, blue green, and different values for each-The main upgrade system could also be reworked, buying new ships is nice, and I know you cant have too much change due to the leaderboards, but as a player I would like to be able to permanently upgrade my ship or have some external options to use my coins and feel like I have a sense of progression.In closing: More enemy variation, crazier powerups, more upgrades, and a sense of progression would all be additions that would make what is already a good game into something with more replayability and addictiveness."

I think this is a good game with little flaws and margin to improve.The only two things i can sa about this game are:1. If you must unlock the ships in order, instead of for example buying the last for 60 coins and skiping all the previous ones, there is no point to have to buy them manually.The game needs more variety of weapons. A bigger map would not be bad. And the player should be able to change the color of the ship, because it is sometimes hard to find where you are.A co-op mode would be nice too, because this is the type of game that everyone can play for short periods and with friends. A local PvP would be great too."

I think BBXL recieved Overwhelmingly Positive reviews not because it is an excellent game, but because it is a simple, but solid, shmup that doesn't intend to do much and does nothing wrong outside of the key rebindings, and it's only $1 or less on sale.- Clean 8 Bit graphics that can make for some nice gifs when there is alot of screen activity- Repetitive chiptune soundtrack - there are apparently about 10 or more tracks in the free DLC soundtrack, but i only heard one song constantly looping-The ship automatically moves, so you simply must turn it left or right - no strafing.- Buttons: Meter limited boosting mechanic, breaking mechanic, fire button (if playing without Auto Fire, which I prefer to save ammo), and screen clearing bomb buttons.- Arena: A enclosed rectangle where the walls will kill you. Incoming asteroids are hinted by light shafts for strategic feedback.- Asteroids drop ammo pick ups for your base weapons and weapon pickups (short range destrucive laser, 3 way shot, short range spread, bomb shot, piercing laser and a couple more)- Besides Asteroids, there are missles that occasionaly shot single bullets, or rockets that explode into multiple bullets, and I've only encountered one ""chasing"" enemy type, but there might be more if you can get further in the game.- Coins occasionally drop which can be used to buy ships that have different armor, shooting, speed, and bomb attributes.And you basically keep shooting asteroids and enemies until you die. Options screen is simplistic as SFX, Music and Vibrate can only be turned off and on with out any sliders/incrementation.Besides the repeating soundtrack, my biggest problem is the lack of easily rebindable keys. Custom inputs made a HUGE difference in my ability to play well and trying to rebind them is cumbersome. You can only rebind them in a Unity game launcher if you hold ALT when you open the game (which is the first time I've ever had to do that for a Steam game - WTF?) and the keys are labeled as their Xbox buttons and not as their in game function - so you need to memorize the keys or just guess. This launcher also can only recognize Trigger inputs as Axes, so you can only rebind them to an actual joystick Analogue stick or trigger button instead of a keyboard-thankfully, I don't think you need them and the face buttons can be mapped to a keyboard.It certainly isn't a a must play and I'm not personally crazy about it - but it might be worth going back to with better controls."

The challenge comes when you have to shoot enemies to get more ammo/points, and collect powerups. The powerups have huge variety, from shooting multiple bullets in a sort of wall to exploding bullets. There are multiple ships you can upgrade to by collecting coins which are dropped by various enemies. There are also various types of enemies in the game, and to up the challenge you can disable autofiring and fire yourself. Both keyboard and controller are supported, and my Steam controller worked right away without even having to open Big Picture mode [ymmv].The game (as of version 2.02) is somewhat sparse in the settings menu, but it gets the job done.I have tested it on Linux, and it runs very well.Overall the game is very well polished, runs very well, and I am happy with my purchase."

Thank you.I got this game with a 75% off coupon.This game is a simple arcade asteroid shooter.You have a basic rocket with a ""Auto Fire"" Option i found it annoying because i kept running out of ammo. But it is way harder without it. When you kill blobs you get score and ammo and occasionally coins.With coins you can buy new rockets, The new rockets have different abilities. The point of the game is to get a high score.It starts off with small blobs and they get bigger And eventually rockets come and try to shoot you down.Until eventually you don't even know what is going on.Theres also trading cards which is a plus.Pros-Unlimited replays for the price of one live in a real arcade-Fun addictive and worth the price!- A variety of rockets to try out.- Leaderboards- Trading cardsCons- Repetetive (New maps would be cool)- Could find something almost the exact same online for free- Controls are a little to sensetive (At least for mouse)CONCLUSIONFor the price i deffinetly recommend the game!It's a simple arcade shooter And that's all there is to say about it!Rating: 8/10"

But then there are a variety of powerups that change your shooting, faster, rebound, laster, wide blast, homing, etc.  All use ammo, which you re-acquire by killing things, some exhaust faster than others.   For the short time you can have with this until you've unlocked all and tried all the weapons, it was fun, especially in short bursts to try to do better than my high score.

This game is freaking wonderful!  This game looks like something from the Nintendo generation and plays like something from ... well I can't explain it other than it really captures what it means for a game to be a good game.   Controls are simple and easy to pick up, it's rewards you for playing well, and the music changing with each new ship actually had me playing more to get enough to unlock the next ship.  The weapons variations also reminded me of when I first played Contra sooooo many years ago.  I was like ""ohh, what's the S do?... cool!  Oh what's that F do!??  WOW""  <-- haven't had that feeling in a game in some time, so thank you.   Great game, better than fair price, excellent retro'ish shooter brought into the present.  Will be playing it a lot more.

Its fun from the beginning and then it continues to be fun as new powerups and baddies are thrown at you. Probably would have threatened Asteroids and Space Invaders if it came out in the seventies. If you like this try Waves.I only have a few complaints in that a ship lasts for a short time. The screen quickly gets crowded with enemies and thier missiles and you won't survive a hit with a wall or more than a couple impacts so you're constantly starting over. Its very easy to steer into a wall when things get hectic and that usually ends the game. Some of the missiles fired by enemies are the same color as missiles fired by your own ship which is unnecessarily confusing.After only a few hours of gameplay I already have owned all the ships available for a couple of hours. It doesn't have to be that short of a game.They let you select auto fire or manual fire but they only let you use the X button on your x box controller for PC. That isn't very practical since you're using a and b heavily to speed up and slow down your ship. It would be nice if you could use a trigger button or shoulder button. More programmable buttons is what I'm saying. Give the customer lots of options to come up with the ideal configuration. And how about a power up to give you a protective bouncy bubble for slamming against the wall or other ships? That would be nice for BB2XL. Also, some bright, pretty graphics. Not clutter but sharper."

Great variety of ships you can use (they get progressively better (more firepower, more shields and speed))3. Gameplay is basic, but its addicting and keeps you wanting to playFor what its worth; give it a try - its a game that is actually quite enjoyable if you have a few minutes to play it at a time.

,Recommended,433950,28401429,"Posted: 16 December, 2016",all,COMPUTEROSIS,"Bit Blaster XLis a simple shmup in the best way possible! You are, but, a Bit Blaster ship with fininite amount of ammo, shooting down enemies that could destroy you in one shot/touch all while picking up ammo/coins that slowly gravitate towards you, power ups that [could] change how you shoot down said enemies, and sometimes a shield/bomb/boost to help you last just a bit longer to surpass your own score and beyond...The store page's description of the game (as of Ver. 3.0) is about as accurate as it sounds! The more you play, the more coins you could collect overall to buy the next [better] Bit Blaster ship and so on and so forth... Each ship carries their own strengths and weaknesses in size, speed, rate of auto fire, and initial shield-to-bomb ratio at the beginning of each round... Depending on one's own playstyle, you may gravitate to certain ship versions more than others once you do unlock all of the Bit Blaster ship versions...Now, at the time of this review, this game for only 0.99 USD seems like the most perfect game within its own genre... In a way, it does suceeed in using its own throwback aesthetic to its advantage while also changing it up a bit with the concept of fininte ammo and now almost-screen-clearing bombs you can activate manually... However, on a more personal note, the game could not recognize my Steam Controller outside of the game's [controller] rumble feature (thus resorting to me playing this game with a PS3 controller binded with 360 controls controller-wise)... Also, despite it's easy-to-play-hard-to-master gameplay, all of the power ups and potential shield/bomb/boost pickups appear at random (just like the enemies only without a pending visual cue), thus finding that one power up/pickup to appear on the screen that you know will give you that [better] edge may not happen soon enough and/or appear too soon to react to it effectively...Regardless, this game is still fun for the price and still has means to improve like the previous versions of this game! If you are a fan of arcade shooters likeAsteriods(for the obvious comparison/example) or the first fewGeometry Warsgames, then it's worth putting some time into... I mean, most of the achievements are prety easy-ish to get, there's Steam Trading Cards (if you're into that sort of thing), and the soundtrack is FREE after purchase! Also, you don't have to wait for a [pending] Steam Sale becuase it's cost [less than] a US dollar in general!"

There's plenty of different power-ups and enemy types to keep this game interesting.-You can't get any other game this good for the price.Cons:-NoneOther thoughts:As with any other game in this genre, it can get a bit repetitive, and will probably get boring after a half hour of play at one time. This game is great for short periods of time, making it a go-to for if you have a few minutes to kill. Even at full price, this game is still a great value.9/10 - recommend."

Bit Blaster XL is a great deal of fun.Imagine Asteroids, except that you control a more maneuverable ship that constantly moves forward, and you face a wider variety of hostile ships that shoot at you.You can unlock additional ships with slightly different stats (shield count, bomb count, movement speed, hitbox size). Although the ships are all the same basic white palette, and all look kind of similar, they handle differently enough that each one feels like it requires a distinct play style. The game stores separate high scores for each ship, too. The one drawback is that ships must be unlocked in order, meaning you'll have to play for quite some time before you uncover the V8.Unlockables are purchased using coins that downed enemies and asteroids drop at random during play. This can be a pain, as there are times when you can play for a while without making any progress toward a new ship. On the plus side, finding these collectibles can make even a poor scoring run feel worthwhile, since they bring you that much closer to your next unlockable.Sessions can last anywhere from a minute to an hour, depending on how well you play. I find that it lines up with my attention span pretty well. Generally, this game is good for a quick round or two while you're procrastinating.I highly recommend this game if you're a fan of space shooters, or are looking for a cheap, fast game to pad your collections of achievements and trading cards."

Good fun.Now for the real review.Bit Blaster XL is a retro arcadey Asteroids-esque game. It's an incredibly well executed fast paced bullet hell, with a catchy arcade soundtrack and unlockables. Whats not to like?It takes a while to get used to the controls, simple as they are, so be prepared to smash into the walls a lot. There are a large number of upgrades to choose from, although they could be more accurately described as powerups given they appear at random. That said, without experience it is hard to tell what powerup does what, or even which ones would be useful. The fact that some of the powerup sprites are only differentiated by colour is not helpful, so be prepared also to spend a fair chunk of time swearing because you let the amazing Explosion powerup go for the terrible version of the shotgun powerup (for example).The game also swiftly gets incredibly cluttered, although as I said this is a bullet hell game so what were you expecting. For this there are several useful powerups and several not so useful. Heres a list of my top 5 and one I never take, even if it means sticking with the peashooter they give you at the start.(Note: These are all my own names, given the lack of andy form of guide)1.) Explosion/Lightsaber (Blue E and Green L respectively) depending on which ship you use. Fast ships go for lightsaber as a swift turn can cut through the bigass splitting asteroids really quickly, netting you a nice chunk of ammo. Otherwise go for the explosion, as it lingers for a bit and any enemies that walk into the field left  blow up too.2.) Don't get me wrong, both of the above are incredibly useful on any ship, it's just that faster ships perform better with the lightsaber than slower ones.3.) Homing balls (Orange H). This fires (at a cost of 5 ammo) an orange blob at a random enemy on screen, and lets you keep firing the standard gun. Useful, and given that each ammo drop gives you 5 ammo, as  long as you're quick enough this can go on forever.4.) Ricochet (sorry can't remember the icon for this one). As the name says. Very useful, especially later, as there is no way they can miss with the number of enemies on screen.5.) I agonized for a bit over this one, because there are a couple that are really good. But the last one is Multi (Orange M). This fires a shot to the front and the back. This is especially useful given the turning circle of some of the ships.The one you should never, ever, ever go for :-M♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (Purple M). The only boost this has, as far as I can tell, is making the ammo pickups drift towards you slightly quicker. Given that they do this anyway, and that it slows down the speed of your main weapon firing, it's just useless. Unless you want a challenge."

There's a free key for Steam. I hope you have some fun with it!I liked the gesture so much that I decided I'd buy the game rather than use the code anyways to support the game.I also promissed to write a review for the game, but I wanted to wait for a while until I had more time spent in the game before writing my review. So here it goes!I would definitely recommend this game! It seems simple enough, but it is incredibly addicting and I found it hard to stop playing when I really got into it. I got used to the controls very quickly, and found them to be simple but perfect for the game. I also really enjoyed the unlockable stuff, because it gave me a reason to keep playing rather than just trying to top my old high score. Each ship was different, so I liked how it kept the high scores for each ship separate. The different power ups were also fun, although some of them were clearly better than others. Then again it also depends on how you play so the diversity was great.Edit:Oh yeah, and awesome music which made the game even more enjoyable. Made the game even more fun, and I'd personally be willing to download the soundtrack if the creator put it up for a small price :DOverall an incredibly fun and addicting game with a great price (I honestly would have payed much more for it), and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a little something to mess around with."

Incredibly enjoyable - old school Asteroids playstyle.  You have limited ammo - that ammo can be obtained from the enemies you destroy on screen.  Random powerups spawn and give you all sorts of fun enhancements - bouncing bullets, shotguns, behind-the-back attacks, bombs, etc.  You just keep playing until you die and keep trying to make the highest score.Unlike Asteroids you are always moving and can only slow your ship down at the cost of using your boost meter.  If you run out of ammo you're left vulnerable so always keep track of how much you have left.  Different weapons use different amounts of ammo.I look forward to seeing more from this author.  Stick with this formula Adam, you understand what a lot of us gamers want - addicting and fun gameplay.Seriously, if you see it on sale, get it, but get it anyway if it's not.

You play as one of eight unlockable ships and destroy asteroids and enemy space ships to gain points while using numerous upgrades.GameplayThe gameplay is simple but it works in its favor. The weapon upgrades are mostly unique and almost always useful(The exception being the Trail power up). You can use bombs to clear the entire screen of enemies. Coins randomly drop from enemies and you can use them to buy a total of eight different ships. The coins drop so often that I unlocked seven of the eight ships within 2.5 hours of playing. The ships have four stats: Life, Speed, Firing Speed, and Number of Bombs. Each ship is unique and plays differently from each other. The game also controls amazingly well on the Steam Controller and I highly recommend you use it if you own one. My one big criticism is that the game does become repetitive after a couple hours.The VisualsWhile it doesn't look stunning, it doesn't need to be since it is a retro arcade throwback. They graphics do their job and do it well.ConclusionOverall a good game with few flaws but it can get repetitive after awhile. This game is definetly worth your $.99."

It may not be your cup of tea, but if you are an 80s-90's kid, or one born in the wrong era, you should ABSOLUTELY check out this game. I mean, come-on! $0.99?!?

Nice little spacy rotaty space shippy shoot incoming beasties game :) For me, good for an hour or two of quite old-fashioned enjoyment. Well worth the 1/5 McChicken I paid.If you loved Luftrausers, you'll probably find this somewhat above average.The good: Interesting variety of space enemies, OK music, very nice gameplay pacing.The bad: bland weapon variety, blander unlocked-ship-variety. More surprises in unlocks would have kept me interested for much longer. See Luftrausers."

I actually have upped my review after playing for a longer time, because now I don't think there are any problems with the game whatsoever. The only small thing is that the laser powerup is definitely a powerup that you will want to keep, but even this is balanced by the fact that you run out of ammo faster with the laser.

It starts off fairly easy, but gets challenging by the minute with the increasing amount of obstacles in screen, creating a formidable experience.Now, one of the main things I like about videogames and other works is the soundtrack.

More devs should follow suit.The addition of two game modes supporting both auto fire and non-auto fire is such a simple thing, but it makes a huge difference by giving the player the option.  I found the selective firing method provided a gaming experience that made me feel much more in control of the game rather than before where it was just a monotonous exercise in moving around.  You can time your shots and WAIT for enemies to position based on the type of special powerups you have now.  Originally the simple premise of the game was part of its charm, but also highlighted some flaws.  Putting the timing of movement and firing back in the player's control adds that little strategy that was missing before.For the price, now I would definitely recommend this game.*Original Review below (Negative)*I like the concept of the game, but after about 45 minutes, you'll have all the achievements (except the higher score ones) and nothing else to do.  Even something as simple as some score multipliers would keep the game fresh a little longer.  With that said, the thing that needs the most work is the auto-shooting.I'm not entirely opposed to the auto-shooting mechanic.  I mean, it's the developers game so it's his/her choice, but one thing that is unsatisfactory about it is the fact that as soon as you press ""start"" to begin a game, there about 5-6 enemies that slowly spawn over about 30 seconds, but your ship is forced to shoot off in the distance for what boils down to probably a 10% accuracy rate simply because there is nothing to shoot.Now, no one cares about accuracy, it's not even a stat to track in this game, but I bring it up because of the simple fact that there is no DEFAULT unlimited ammo so when you run out of ammo (because you're forced to shoot into the void remember?), you simply STOP SHOOTING.  That's it.  The game is a SHOOTER!What should happen is one of two things:1.  If you have a special weapon and run out of that type of ammo, your ship should default to regular unlimited bullets.2.  If you don't have a special weapon, you should never run out of the default bullets.  (Think Contra for the NES).I'll change my review if the default bullet issue is addressed.  It's just not fun.  Even for $0.99."

The fantastic pixel art blends perfectly with the really catchy music that chirps away as you blast astriods and enemy spaceships.The sense of progression is simple, as it should be in this retro style game, and doesn't feel overwhelmingly grindy - although it is essentially what you're doing. The weapons really stand out too - Some are your average three-way bullets, or your slightly bigger ones - but there are some really intuitive weapons too. My personal favourite is the lazor sword, which is bloody perfect as long as you manage your ammo.Oh - This game also has ammo. Yeah, it's an odd mechanic to add into an endless shooter like this, but it works really well. You can have your shooting set to automatic, which is really handy when you just want to focus on getting out of annoying situations, but I prefer to play with this turn off. One addition that I feel would really help the game feel much smoother would be the ability to toggle this function on and off during a game - Maybe binding it to 'Y' or 'B' on the controller? That way, one can switch their focus from gaining points and swerving to dodge the debris that quickly fills your screen.Overall, if you think you like the look of this, you'll probably have tonnes of fun with it. And why not? It's under £1~-Ashe"

Again!""This review is for the version 2.10 of the game.Graphics: 30%Audio: 30%Gameplay: 60%Replayability: 80%Value for money: 100%Overall: 60%About the scores: In shoot'em ups/bullet hell, I feel the visual- and audio presentation is as important as the gameplay. You need a catchy tune and some real cool graphics to really get the adrenaline pumping. That is why I weight all 5 scores similar.The first time I played this game, I was not impressed, to say the least. The graphics were dull, the music did not fit the game, and the sound effects needed work. This is still the case. The gameplay was not very engaging, and the controls were not optimal. That, on the other hand has changed... a lot!And maybe the constant changes and additions is what makes me play this game over and over again. Even though I gave it such a low score. Because, as a game, I feel the price tag is about right. You get your moneys' worth. It might be engaging for 10 minutes. Then you put it away and forget about it. Unless you try to unlock all the ships. But since I wrote the intial review, the developer has been in constant dialogue with me, improving the parts that me and the other players pointed out. Implementing ideas, and makes the game evolve over time. That is very interesting to be a part of. Personally, I feel Steam is not the arena for developing a game. I require a finished product, when I buy something from steam. But that time is probably in the past.So what do you get if you buy this game? It's a shoot'em up with simple graphics. The controls are tight. The ships have diffrent stats, but not much more different than that. It's a single difficulty/level with increasing numbers of enemies over time. And powerups. A lot of different powerups.I would reccomend this game to anyone that likes shoot'em ups/bullet hells. I must admit that I have pressed the play ""again button"" too many times. Just to get a better score. Because I know I can do better the next time."

This review used to be a negative one because i saw this game at the top of the steam games list but when i played it it wasnt much fun. I have been periodically going back to it to see whats new with the updates and whatnot and now I have been pushed over the edge in giving this one a positive review since the amount of pollish and work put into this is worth a purchase on its own.I do have a few nitpicks, enemies don't seem to have a telegraph for their shooting, on more than one occasion i have been shot by an enemy that I just  killed because their was no tell for when they would shoot. Additionally since the game is score based, there isnt much insentive to shoot asteroids since ammo drops give you an increase in score as well, patient players can just bide their time picking up ammo drops to increase their score, I think this behaviour should be discouraged, maybe just by taking away the score increase for the ammo drops.But these are minor gripes and the average player will have fun with this game regardless, you will definitely get your £- per-hour here so do yourself a favour and consider buying.

,Recommended,433950,28788368,"Posted: 29 December, 2016",all,ZHDINC,"At $0.99 (or cheaper if on sale), you can't do much better for a retro-styled arcade shmup. The game plays much like Asteroids except you can't cross the borders of the screen and the enemies only come from the left and right sides. The game starts off with simple asteroids to pick off and gradually introduces enemies of increasing complexity as your score increases. Initially, there is only one ship to play the game, but as you gather coins from random drops from destroyed enemies, there are seven additional variants to unlock (but only in order). The late game ships are generally more capable, so most players will probably be sticking with Ships 6-8. I personally prefer Ship 8 because it has the best capabilities, but at 100 coins to unlock (in addition to needing to using coins to unlock the previous ships), you'll have to play for a while to get it.There are a multitude of powerups to collect during regular gameplay, but I think most will find that only a few are actually useful and the others are quite terrible. Now, it is tempting for me to just write off the offending powerups, but it does make for interesting gameplay in that you are trying to dodge enemies and bullets in addition to powerups that are likely to ruin a good run. It can be agony waiting for the right powerup to appear sometimes though (especially near the start, I tend to start over if a powerup I don't like appears first). After you get a powerup, you have it as long as you don't run out of ammo. It can be really difficult to conserve ammo with auto-fire enabled, but quite simple to do firing manually.Two of powerups have rather odd behavior though. There is a homing powerup that seems to go after ships you are aiming at (otherwise targeting closest ships), which is fine, but this often means that you'll have a homing shot going after a small asteroid in the distance while completely ignoring actual threats nearby. You can still fire manually with the homing powerup, but it is frustrating to watch the homing shot completely pass more dangerous enemies. The other powerup that I feel has issues is magnet, a powerup that draws in ammo and coins on screen. There is really no need for this powerup in manual firing mode, but the thing I really don't like about it is the lag it seems to introduce with firing inputs (which is hard to tell if it's intentional or not). I have accidentally collided with a number of enemies due to a lack of firing from this lag that the magnet powerup seems to introduce. Though again, this just adds to gameplay in giving me an incentive to avoid collecting the magnet powerup altogether.Aside from powerups, my only other real gripe is that sometimes the hitbox seems bigger than it should be, but otherwise gameplay is about what you can expect from an arcade shmup styled in way that feels like Asteroids. There are a number achievements with the game that most will find are appropriately difficult. I still haven't gotten the 75K in a single run achievement, but will as I try to improve my high score.And on the topic of high scores, this is a gripe that is unrelated to the game itself. When I first played the game, the Version 3.00 patch was relatively new and the leaderboards had scores that appeared achievable. However, I recently checked and the top scores are now clearly the work of cheaters. The main way you can tell is that they unlocked all the achievements in the game within an hour (most within fifteen minutes) which just reeks of foul play. On a game worth $0.99, come on, really? Is it really that important to you to cheat to get the highest score on the leaderboard? I mostly play to improve my own score, but it is sad that not even this game is immune to cheaters unfairly getting the top positions on the scoreboard. Unfortunate, but I think most will be able to see where the real leaderboard starts. EDIT: Most recent check has the blatantly cheating scores removed, so at least for a moment there is a proactive effort going on to keep the leaderboard clean.Get this game! It is a load of fun! I personally turn off the music in favor of my own. I recommend playing with a controller."

The gameplay, which is basically just running around in circles shooting balls that drop ammo, gets harder as the game progresses. Enemies start to appear, which shoot rockets at you. You start of with a shield, and after one hit, its gone. Then, if you take another hit, your done. You have to restart. Which, honestly, doesn't get repetitive, surprisingly. I've only gotten to around 4k score myself. There are many powerups in this game, such as a lightsaber to whack through the big balls, or grenades that spurt out little balls on impact. And, a little cool feature, coins that drop as you get farther in the game. With these coins, you can unlock different space ships. (You can't buy coins either, which is amazing. You actually have to play to unlock more space ships, which I think is a great feature. Non pay 2 win.) This game; I just can't get enough of it. 10/10, a fun retro style shooter that doesn't get old."

They don't have believable worlds and couldn't be on an 80's console due to the size. Retro games were all about simple games and concepts put into many levels.Bit Blaster XL is amazing in creating the illusion that you're playing on an NES. The graphics are on point with the pixel theme, the music feels like an upgraded version of that of ""Space Invaders"", and the gameplay is golden.In this game, you take control of a pixel spaceship, your goal is to destroy the enemy fleet which is invading your territory. You do this by collecting one of many powers to help you destroy astroids and ships. But be carefull! If you fly into the edge of the map you instantly die.Thoughts and OpnionsIn conclusion, Bit Blaster XL is a game that everybdy with over 15 minutes of time should play. I give Bit Blaster XL a score of 9.5/10, with the title of ""Fit for an arcade; an instant classic""."

Very simple mechanics, very addictive, very, very affordable. You can make back most (if not all) of the price of the game easily by selling off Inventory cards obtained from playing it, it's that cheap.The music is catchy and I like that the background music changes with each new unlocked ship. It gives the player a reason to get enough coins to unlock one other than a different ship sprite and slightly different stats.I really like that there is such a variety of content in such a simple game. Lots of different enemies, obstacles and powerups. My favourite powerups are the Fire/Laser ones(they act pretty similar to each other), the Homing one, and the Exploding one. The Magnet one is entirely detrimental in my opinion, however I don't think that having negative powerups is a bad thing, it makes avoiding them a challenge plus it gives you a reason to use the bombs, as it removes them from the screen.I didn't find much use for Autofire mode, I prefer to aim manually and only shoot when I think I'm on target rather than constantly spraying bullets.I think it would be really cool if the different ship types had mechanics entirely unique to each other; for example, different default firing type/rate, or the amount of ammo the ship can hold at once.Definitely worth a play, especially at the price of a toilet roll."

,Recommended,433950,32537571,Posted: 18 June,all,TheRedTetra,"EDIT: Updated from a No to Yes recommendation.BackgroundI am not a fan of arcade shooters. However, I bought this game because it was under a dollar (in terms of USD), and I haven't played arcade shooters in more than a decade. So it was more of a novelty.OverviewBit Blaster XL itself is not very innovative. It's a pretty straightforward arcade shooter, with a grindy unlock system for more powerful spaceships. Ironically I preferred the slower, lower-tier spaceship for its easier control haha.I find the difficulty ramp-up a little unsatisfying. Some spaceships are mere annoyances, while there's 2 particular spaceships that are a must-kill or the map becomes a dodge-em after than a shoot-em-up.Ammo and Boost/Brake is a limited resource, though the latter is time-rechargeable. The limited ammo is pretty interesting, though I find it a little on the tough side to conserve ammo given that all the Ammo powerups eat through ammo so quickly.For its price, Bit Blaster XL is pretty alright for a quick, casual play. There's enough gameplay mechanics and polish inside to give you a few good hours spread over a couple of days.MusicEach ship has its own music. I think my spaceship choice is somewhat related to my preferred choice of tunes. It's a little refreshing when you switch to a new ship after a couple of rounds/days and you hear a new tune.ControlsI highly recommend using a controller for this game. If you're using controller, you should probably remap the buttons so that you can Fire, Boost/Brake at the same time.PerformanceThis game has mild performance issues. Keep VSync on. Although VSync off makes the controls more responsive, but it causes random screen stutters. I'm using i7-7700HQ so it's not a spec issue.Overall* Polish: 5/5* Novelty: 2/5* Music: 4/5* Fun: 4/5* Replayability: 5/5* Playtime: 0.2 - 0.5 hour eachSee Also: Orbt XLGo get the developer's other game as a Bundle: Orbt XL.

It is a simple game, and the mechanics are well known, but it brings a lot of variety to the table like many different weapons, the limited ammo, different unlockable ships, various different enemies and a nice soundtrack that doesn't get on your nerves.For the money it costs, it is a steal and it entertains you for a few minutes or a few hours - whatever you want. It's the arcade look and feel of old. Well done, programmer and thank you for the linux build!"

It's pretty simple so not much to explain.  Wouldn't hurt to have just a few seconds of additional instructions about how to collect coins, but it's so simple it wasn't really needed I suppose.

I can play it while I'm watching TV, which is nice.   I'm sure it would be better on a Windows machine with a controller.  I played it on a Mac (since that's all I have while I'm away), and the controls are utter crap without a joystick.  I can't use the arrow keys and shoot at the same time, probably because the firing key is Control.  And unbeknownst to me, control + left arrow on a Mac takes you to the dashboard--even in the middle of the game!  And you have to press Control + Option to fire a bomb, because that key is Alt, which is much more accessible on a Windows machine than on a Mac.What that basically means is I'm stuck using the ""autofire"" mode, which is still fun enough, but much harder to sustain as you progress.  Especially when you get those sweet ships with the fast rate of fire.  On autofire mode, those ships aren't very useful since they run out of ammo so fast.  I don't think I'll be able to progress much more without a controller.All of this wouldn't be an issue if we were allowed to designate new keys for the functions.  Please?"

I had close to three hours logged before Steam reset my time for some reason (has happened with several other games I bought around the same time), so $1 for close to 5 hours and counting of play time is a hell of a seal.Only criticism from me is that the power ups seem to come in waves.

You are auto firing (you can change this) and you need to collect ammo by destroying asteroids, as well as collect power ups, and dodge everything around you, as contact with these will destroy you. Also every so often a coin appears, which upon collection of enough allows the unlocking of a new ship, with various attributes and beneficial upgrades.

This game is really fun and simple. There are plenty of weapon pickups with unique attacks, my favorite being the beam, though it has the trade off of being short.There are unlockable ships too, with varying size, shooting speed, move speed, and shields, which determines how many hits you can take before death, though crashing into a wall will always insta-kill you.As you play the game, little gold coins will either drop from enemies, or simply roll on screen. Collect them and use them to unlock the ships. First ship unlock costs 5 points, next one costs 10, and they keep increasing in cost by 5, with the current(as of this review) final ship costing 30.This game is just incredibly fun and for only a dollar at most.

Where do I even start?Bit Blaster XL is a modern take on some of the old retro-sytle arcade games you played back in the 80s(yes i'm not from the 80s. mind you. I was born 2001) there is 8 ships, and each has its' own custom speed,fire rate, shield durability, and song! with each ship it is a little different than the last considering you only have a max of 100 ammo, but there is an option for manual shooting if you want more of a challenge.Not to mention since each ship is different you have to adapt to all of them. they each have a different play style. it's kinda like you just got a new game and need to learn how it works. The game has great graphics, and even if you have a $200 laptop that's OK! this game barely needs much at all. there is around a dozen or more powerups and each is different. once you run out of ammo with a powerup then you have to collect more ammo, but you lose the powerup, but don't worry. you can pick up ammo with the powerup: just be careful! don't run into the walls! there is a bit of variety when it comes to enemies. the higher your score: the stronger then enemies(and the more too! might I add).You unlock ships by using coins which randomly drop from enemies and some enemies only drop coins. What to talk about next? Ah Yes! The songs are also great! they have a real 8-Bit feel to them(Props and kudos to Spiff Tune. he did an amazing job on the songs. if you're reading this; good job man!). there is such a variety with this game and no two games will be the same! all the things fit really well together and it really feels like an 80s game!And that should just about wrap things up here! I hope this review helped and if there is anything I should add please let me know! other than that I want to thank the dev for being active and really listening to what we have to say! I can only imagine how hard it is to be a single dev, but hey! no one can argue with you! Good job Nickervision!

This game is quite literally Asteroids ON STEROIDS!With all of these newer games being driven by graphics and story, it's a breath of fresh air to see a game that hearkens back to the golden age of games where the only thing that mattered was getting as high of a score as you could. And that is exactly what the dev wanted from Bit Blaster XL.The minimalist art style further extends the feeling that you are playing a quarter-eating arcade game from the 80's, along with simple controls that could be played on even an NES controller, short rounds for quick sessions, and competing for high scores with other players.And now for my big question: For this game, would you rather pay a quarter per-round, or a dollar for as many rounds as you'd like? I'd choose the latter. Seriously, this game is only one dollar; a steal of a deal considering how well-made this game really is. Don't wait for a sale, BUY IT NOW!"

There is enough variety in the ships you unlock to make playing with each a slightly different experience.

Though, it'd be an amazing thing if devs kept this updated (Like they are doing for now!) adding new spaceships, backgrounds, etc.My personal opinion.Based on the fact it was made by a starter indie team, feels good to support buying their nice game.It's not buggy, includes Steam Trading Cards and Achievements.A good suggestion: The textures should be 3D, or at least the spaceship and meteors should be voxel'd. Though this could mean a lot of time i am sure this could be a greater and more atractive game.Overall a 9/10."

This game is a great blend of the two, with the classic feel of blowing up space debris but with a variety of ships and powerups to help you along the way.  The gameplay is very engaging, and when you inevitably die, you get pulled right back in for another round.On top of that, the sound track is incredible, and changes with each ship!  Each track has a lively beat that ramps up as you play, and fits very well with the fast paced nature of the game.Something that I really appreciate in this game, that so many others of this genre don't have, is the ability to toggle auto-fire.  The constant ""pew-pew-pew"" of similar games can feel repetitive and grating, but Bit Blaster lets you decide which mode you would prefer when you select your ship.  There are also separate high scores for each ship, and for each fire mode as well!For less money (and calories) than a dollar menu sandwich, Bit Blaster XL is an absolute riot of a good time!"

The crosshair is actually the fire rate, and the dev pointed out that there is a powerup legend in the pause menu (which I had never opened before now).The other problem is the inconsistant progression system. Ships are purchased using coins that seemingly randomly drop from enemies-I've gone ten games without seeing a single coin and suddenly find 3 in the eleventh. I think a progression system that relies less on luck could greatly benefit this game.Overall, I think the game is pretty ok. To me, it feels like this game is sitting in the uncomfortable position between PC game and mobile game- it's too simplistic to be a good PC game, but it's clearly designed for computers (I can't imagine how the controls would work on a phone or tablet). But, this game has a lot of potential, it just needs some small changes and additions."

So far I've gathered that you only get one life and the epic fail music bit at the beginning is really funny. Here are some points I like:* It's not an easy game, so if you like a challenge then this is it.* If you were ever a fan or Asteroids, this game takes it to another level.* The developer has put it up at a very fair price.* It's replayable and addictive.* You can upgrade to different ship versions by collecting yellow credits in game.* The screen goes nuts and you end up in a zen-like state focusing on that little ship in the middle of anarchy."

Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor.Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together.Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!"

My gripes were mostly with the turning radius and autofire leading to a lot of frustrating deaths and ultimately feeling like the game is mostly out of your hands. Now, even though I still kind of suck at it, it's entirely my own fault when I explode and that makes for a much more rewarding experience. With that in mind I also rescind my comment that a brake would be better than a turbo, since the brake might actually be too overpowered.It's a buck, it's simple and its mobile heritage is evident but now it feels like it works as its own thing.

Both enemies and special weapons feel unique and fairly balanced, and the visuals are very informative. The price is right for an arcade game, but I'm not sure it's worth playing unless you're interested in struggling against quirky, obtuse controls."

Now you have to avoid 2 things, the grey ones and those spikes, if you could build an option to choose the size of the map, that would be awesome and more comfortable to play.There are A LOT of bubbles across the map and they dont disappear quickly, which only makes it more and more messy.I hope you will update the game and try your best to fix it.

I want to like it so badly, but there are a few things that hold it back, at least for me.Chief among them is the controls. I like my ships to go where I point, not rotate how I tell them. I'm comparing this game to Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved, and if the movement of the ship was handled like it was in that game I'd enjoy it a lot more -- especially since it would make aiming much easier. I guess it comes down to the disign choice where your ship can't stop moving -- I see the complexity it adds, but even if there was a way to make a control stick correspond to which direction the ship was facing it would be mch appreciated. The other things I dislike -- like a lack of wraparound -- are largely a matter of taste and don't affect my experience that badly, but the controls really hold this game back.As far as the positives go, the other reviews are largely correct when they sing this game's praises. For the ridiculously low price point, having that many different ships and weapons is downright insane. There's a lot here, and I really want to dig into it further, but without any way to change the controls it may be stuck on the shelf for quite some time.That said, if this game is on sale it becomes stupid cheap, and it's still inexpensive on its own, so if you want to spend a buck on steam, there are worse ways.All in all, promising game with huge potential undone by controls that, while they do what they're supposed to, work against the tight maneuverability these sorts of games are known for. The low, low price point redeems a lot o the flaws, but since I still won't be getting much enjoyment out of it, I have to give it a thumbs down."

There are far too many powerups that I constantly find myself pausing to see which one is which. Most of the powerups are bad and others are overpowered. Lack of upgrades or a coherant pattern of weapon scheme makes it so that your score is luck of the draw. Then when you get a weapon that you like, you spend your time trying to avoid other weapons floating around. Then if you accidentally hit one, it's a major detriment.It's a cell phone game and it shows. Twin stick would make this game a lot more fun. Steering left and right like there are wheels on the ground literally makes no sense, a rocket can't move like that. Without twin stick, it's just frustrating to navigate around the enemies that shoot directly at you and you find yourself just moving around in circles. The arbitrary turning radius is also difficult to get used to.The automatic firing mode is poorly balanced and once you get down to zero bullets which is all too easy in the slow earlier sections, then you just constantly lose your powerups."

My overall dislike of your game, explained below, is no summary of your character, nor of your potential at making great games in the future. Now, let us begin.Bit Blaster XL is one of the worst things that ever happened!In this sadness simulator, Bit Blaster XL, players learn nothing about themselves, nor of the state of mankind, nor of the meaning behind their mortality. This “game,” which makes 9/11 look good in comparison, gives no commentary, holds up no mirror to the soul, and is no better than terrorism.At best, Bit Blaster XL is like innocent babies getting eaten alive.It is a Zika-carrying mosquito, compared to True Works of Art—like Big Mutha Truckers 2: Truck Me Harder.In the THQ-published classic Big Mutha Truckers 2: Truck Me Harder, players see depictions of life in the United States, specifically in The South. It is a great work of video game realism.Meanwhile, Bit Blaster XL depicts nothing real nor fantastic, and offers no cultural transmission superior to feces spewing forth from a wrestler’s♥♥♥♥♥♥ It normalizes racism, and it is worse than Slavery. In fact, Bit Blaster XL manages to be vomit mixed with♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Even when compared to famously-Worst Games, like E.T. the Extraterrestrial.E.T. the Extraterrestrial, famous for its frustrating “gameplay,” at least provides players a touching message about the lives of Illegal Immigrants. While Bit Blaster XL depicts No Life—just soulless, joyless spaceships, amid Space Trash.One of my friends asked me, as I was discussing this vile garbage with him, “And what is bit blaster in comparison to older arts, like literature?”Well, in Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina, for example,we see a hot aristocratic mom, Anna, become bored with her suffocating marriage to Karenin. We see her cheat on her husband with the handsome, virile Vronsky, and thus, her family gets destroyed (via her quest for a non-boring life). And by the end of the near-800-page, exquisitely-written novel, we see Anna fall deep into depression with Vronsky, with whom she has moved in. We see her spiral into an existential quagmire, one from which she cannot escape. Except by one method.And what does Bit Blaster XL allow us to see?Nothing!Compared to Tolstoy’s classic, Bit Blaster XL is a Mass Grave—mere seizure-inducing lights appearing on a screen, set to the tune of blindfolded men screaming.Bit Blaster XL is a digital form of ISIS.And so, I recommend you save your dollar, and your time. Life is short, and you need not spend any of it on this child porn which masquerades as “Art.”Oh, and DON’T GIVE IN to the fact that the developer continues to update his game more than a year post-release, and even answers questions when players email him. Such behavior merely shows his inability to countenance the horror of this plague he’s unleashed on the world.So overall, I’d say it’s okay.5/10"

Of course it doesn't cost much, so maybe that is why a lot of people are ok with it as is. Hopefully it will grow into the potential of a seriously great game.Update:Man, Adam the developer seems like a really great person. I honestly wrote the above thinking not a whole ot of it, since I don't really review games, and since there were SO many positive reviews that I just didn't understand. So I wrote it real quick, checked for spelling errors (which I still missed some) and clicked submit.But wow, Adam wrote some very thoughtful and amazing comments below (you should definitely read) and then added some updates to the game. I mean, wow, again. That's the sign of someone who has some insanely great work ethic and a lot of pride in his product. I really admire that.Based on Adam's comments and some time spent in introspection, I'm flipping my recommendation. But I do have to say this: if you are expecting Egaroids or Asteroids from the old days, which I mistakenly did based on my limited research into the game (i.e. looking at the pics from the store page)...know that it is a different game.And with the updates from Adam, I can in good conscious say this: a seriously good game to play.Thanks for being amazing Adam!

,Recommended,433950,29812922,Posted: 9 February,all,A.C.C. The Limper,For $.49 you CANNOT go wrong with this game.  It's simple and fun.  Nothing to deep and not too aggravating.  Reminds me a bit of Asteroids as a kid but with a bit smoother gameplay and more features.  Definitely worth the money.
,Recommended,433950,29789857,Posted: 8 February,all,Dry Ice Factory,Not bad considering you can spend two quarters on a game with infinite plays while you could pay two quaters for a few rounds at an arcade. I think that's the very best way to look at this game.
