I still have a way to go in the game myself, but I am just enjoying it and not rushing through it.The Art Style is very unique and original, and I quite like it, while other's may not. I am just in awwww with this lovely game, and have no regrets buying the ""Pitter Patter Edition"" which has the interactive book, in which I have discovered you will find under software in your librarys if you purchased this Edition of course. If You have it you will need to download it first to view it, as its separate from the main game.As I write this review I speak for myself and I can say that I am so enjoying this game, it does keep you on your toes and can be a bit confusing at times, BUT have patients and be persistant and you will get through. The game is not very difficult, you play as a baby lynx cub and he/she is so very cute, I now have a lovely Baby Bear buddy to help me on my journey.:)The Store page tells a better picture about the game, so I would make your own judgements via the store page.I prefere not to spoil anymore, given my influx of spoiler taged screenshots, believe me the game itself is much better than screen shots, as I did find it tricky to get desent and clear pictures. In game is best in my opinion 9/10"
76561198217041065,Recommended,434000,32158621,Posted: 3 June,all,HipsterGoat,"This game is beautiful and wonderful. Just from the beginning, you can tell that Might and Delight put lots of work into the designs and patterns in the forest. I say that this game is adorable and takes you on a little lynx's journey throughout her first steps.Get ready for a rollarcoaster:SPOILERS: TURN BACK NOW IF YOU WANT TO!You start out as a little lynx, snuggled up with her siblings at her mother's lap. Then, the mother takes them out for the first time. You get to play games, tackle your brothers and sisters, and eat your first prey. Then, your mother takes you to the river, where you play and run. Then, it overflows. Squealing at the top of your lungs, you are carried across the river by your mother. But then, another kitten squeaks for help. The mother trips and loses you. You yowl for help, and the mother turns around and sees you being carried away. She yowls back, racing desprately to reach you. But a huge wave crashes on top of both you and your mother, and you are carried away as your mother continues to yowl and run after you.You wash up on a creek bed. You open your eyes and explore. Mean swans thrust you about and you get scared from all the big birds. You are trampled from a deer herd, and you try hard to sniff out the trail to your mother. You sniff, following the scent. Sometimes you can see the outlines of you mother, her and your littermates calling your name. They are searching for you, like you are for them. Soon, weary and tired, you come to a clearing in the forest. There, sleeping in the middle, is a lost, little bear cub.You hunt for the bear. The bear cub eats three finches before it walks around with you. Maybe he could help you find your mother...This game is adorable, I've said that already but I can't say it enough. It's heartbreakingly lovingly. If you want to see a fan-fiction version of this, go to my screenshots and start from the beginning. This game is fun, but there are TWO IMPORTANT THINGS that YOU and MIGHT AND DELIGHT need to know:1. This game is super quick. I finished it in three hours. Not worth $15, despite the amazing graphics and attention put into it. More like $10. But I still 100% recommend it.2. To make the lynx look up, you have to right click, hold it, and scroll DOWN. I mean, I got used to it, but it still threw me off. Maybe you could fix this?So, to come to a conculsion, this game is fun, safe, singleplayer, and has beautiful graphics and designs."

76561198042843438,Not Recommended,434000,22090227,"Posted: 27 March, 2016",all,legojoe,"NOTE my down vote is NOT because this is a bad game! Do read this before making a choice!!!Where to begin... I guess firstly we take a look at price tag and content. It took me 3 hours for this game because I wanted both endings, the second playthrough finished faster because I knew what I was going for. So is $15 worth for a game of 3 hours? Well I'm here to explain the game and you decide.Now in Paws unlike the previous titles, you actually play as a cub! A lynx cub. You're separated from family and you're off to an adventure to find them. Along the way you meet a companion and later in the game you will find yourself at a crossroad on which side to pick.The world did get expanded... a little I guess. There are the same old collectibles as in Shelter 1 and 2 that doesn't really do anything aside from achievements. If anything though, I feel like the world is even more vivid than the previous titles and the atmosphere along with the background music playing during specific parts really set the atmosphere really well.One part I was at a swamp-like area and the background music really set the mood that this place isn't very welcoming which was fantastic.The AI is simple and works fine. Although the game still retains the 'feeding' mechanic from the previous titles, it does nothing. You don't get hungry or tired; you can sprint all day and get to the end w/o eating (or at least it seems that way. I didn't try as I ate along the way for immersion). There isn't a hunger/stamina indication so dunno why this is a thing.The rest of the game's pretty linear as usual but you can explore each section of the game to find collectibles and just indulge yourself in the world. Speaking of indulging yourself, since you're playing as a little cub, you can left click to meow! It's so... ADORABLE. I almost fainted out of cuteness.Anyways back to the game. The narrative is quite different in this game. Some areas it's okay, there's a clear direction on where to go, other times it can get confusing. I was stuck at one part of the game for roughly 10-15 minutes because I didn't know where to go.There's also a lack of real danger in the game as dying just resets to last saved point unlike in the previous titles where danger eats your family. Although this could be a feature as it allows you to fully experience the life of a lynx lost in the wilderness trying to return to her family. I know I enjoyed it.So in conclusion, this game is more lively than its predecessors. Much more beautiful and the endings are both fantastic although I'm in favor for one over the other but that's just me. There are two endings so let that be a thing for you to think about as you play this game; a Friend ending and a Family ending.**Minor Spoiler**If you're aiming for the friend ending, when you see foxes, let them attack you.**Minor Spoiler ended**So now back to the question for those who has never played this title series before. Is it worth $15 for a 2-3 hour game? It can even be longer if you're the kind of person who likes to achieve everything in a game. However, I was talking about it being a 2-3 hour game so I'll ask another question. How much does it take you to go watch a movie?Because this is pretty much what it is. It's roughly more or less 1 hour and 40 minutes for the first playthrough as you explore the game and about an hour for the 2nd to reach the 2nd ending. It's dumb they don't have a checkpoint system where you can load back to the split path but whatever.Treat this as more of a visual novel than anything else. Even 1 manga or a novel is roughly $10.This is my personal opinion as a GAMER but $15 for a 3 hour game is a NOPE.On the other side of the coin, as someone who loves cute and cuddly things and a story? $15 is cheap. I have tons of cute things that costed more than just $15."
76561198073477599,Recommended,434000,22045228,"Posted: 25 March, 2016",all,ZirQu,"Pros:- Sweet story- Nice little levels to explore- Easy to learn controls- Family friendlyCons:- Short (play time for me was a little over 3 hours). Could've played for hours more.If you're a fan of the Shelter games, this one is a must have. It has a more concrete story and levels like in Shelter 1, but follows a familiar Lynx cub from Shelter 2. The story is sweet and touching, and exploring the world is just as enjoyable as ever.Bear in mind that the levels are straightforward and not open world, so the opportunities to explore are limited. On the bright side, there is no chance of getting lost. Puzzles provided are simple, but work well in the game's setting.There are memories and collectables to collect, so if you're the type to want to 100% games, you might get a few playthroughs out of this, depending on how carefully you search when you play.If you want a short enjoyable experience, Paws is a wonderful choice. It's just as cute as the trailer would have you believe."
76561198020023397,Recommended,434000,32335694,Posted: 10 June,all,Ganillan,"Let's get it out of the way - yes, this is a short game. I finished it in just under 90 minutes, though I'm sure you can extend that to about 2 hours if you try searching for all the little tidbits laying around. But even with that, I can assure you the game is entirely worth your while.The gameplay itself is decent - I had a bit of irritation over how 'sluggish' the mouse controls were, but it wasn't any bit seriously  bad. Just made tackling the birds or frogs a bit harder.The soundtrack is lovely, and helps evoke the perfect feeling for whatever scenario that pops up - and while I won't give spoilers, it would either leave you on the edge of your seat or holding your heart.Yes, the graphics aren't much to look at - but graphics aren't everything, and even so, for me, the graphics themselves in fact help enhance the game's feel. Not quite detailed, yet at the same time detailed enough for everything to 'feel' there.And lastly - the game's able to tug at your heartstrings with absolute ease, especially with the ending it has. I won't go spoiling it, but no matter which choice you make I can assure you that you'll be at the very least, choking up, let alone bawling just as I was.If you have 2 hours to spare, I can assure you that this game would be  worth every cent of you buying it."

Each one got me attached to each one of my cute lil cubs and made me overwhelmingly sad if I lost one. This game topped it all. Not only did it make me feel emotional, in the game I was trying to go back. The ending made me sadder than I have been in a game and touched me hte most. Amazing game.On the down side, it kept crashing a LOT which was annoying. It can be played for around an hour without exploring and the game will end so don't be me and explore as much as you can!An idea for a new game would be a wolf story. Like a mother wolf and her pups. I have seen a lot of wolf games but I never got the beautiful art style mixed with realistic gameplay. Shelter 1 and Shelter 2 gave that feel and that is why I love Might and Delight. I hope they make more amazing games!"
76561198078447500,Not Recommended,434000,22059906,"Posted: 26 March, 2016",all,TheMiles,"NOTE: Please realise this game is not meant to be like the two Shelter games. It is not an animal survival game, but a story driven game about exploration. I see too many people saying it is bad because it is not like the Shelter games. But it is not supposed to be like them.On to my review then:Paws.. there is a lot to say. I know you will be seeing me saying to not buy this game, even though I admit: I love it.This game was great. Storytelling, music, gameplay, the emotions and how Might & Delight have a really good sense for telling stories from an animals perspective.But then there are the cons. This game is short. Hellishly short. And it saddens me, because I feel like there could have been so much more dangers happening and more bonding between the Lynx cub and her new found friend, the Bear cub.Despite it being claimed as a puzzle-platformer, there was not very much of either. You do jump a lot and there are some areas that are freakishly well hidden, but it all sums up to not really being in that genre in the long run. If I had to put it anywhere, it's a lot like an explorable storybook, which would be okay if it was longer.All in All: I am a hardcore (as hardcore as it gets) fan of Shelter 2. But even I can not really recommend this game entirely. It's beautiful, it's stunning and has a lot of exploration to offer, but it falls short on its length and on the platforming, as well as the connection between Lynx and Bear.  Perhaps there will be DLC to iron its issue out, but as it stands right now, you are better off sticking to Shelter 2."

I don't think I can honestly explain how amazing this game is in a review, man, I could probably talk about it all day. Anywho, I guess I should start my dorkiness of how much I love this game, huh?When I first heard about this game, around two or so months ago, I was oddly impressed by it, even though not much was known and almost no information was given on it. Through all that, I still found myself loving it to death and wanting to play as soon as possible. Strange, isn't it? Oh well, turns out my interest in it turned out great.As soon as I could get back on my computer after it released, I was stunned. The title screen alone was beautiful, and the one track of music that had begun playing was just the same. Everything about this game was just..beautiful and amazing.The game is also only 2 hours long, but with achievments and 2 different endings in mind, it makes a lot of replay-ability!  And taking a look at the scenery and exploring a bunch more is always a fun thing to do in the Shelter series of games.In short, this game is fantastic. I'm sure that you, whomever is reading this, will love this game if you decide to buy it. Everything about it, from the title screen to the credits, is beautiful, and it's truly an amazing experiance."
76561198161226532,Recommended,434000,22889553,"Posted: 9 May, 2016",all,bappy,"Seriously, this game literally made me cry, and in Shelter 2. I will not actually get into Shelter 2 a lot. It is pretty confusing in some parts, in other parts, it completely tells you what to do. I'd say it would be worth 10 instead of 15 but, since I love it so much, its fine. It basically heart-wrenches you. From a happy start, to already a treacherous part, transitions kind of fast. I also love the art style, I have not seen another game with its style (May be one) meaning, its is unique, and does not copy off of others. It also has a great soundtrack (As many games with good soundtracks, sell them) too. Also, a little easter egg, that is also a SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER. READ THIS ONLY IF YOU HAVE PLAYED THE FIRST MOMENTS OF IT! Inna, is the name of the cub you play as. In Shelter 2, your name as a mother is Inna too. Even though the title says ""....A Shelter 2 Game"" I still think it would be one. So this basically tells the story of the mother in Shelter 2. SPOILER OVER. I'd say buy it if you love great story lines, as it is confusing at times, like a puzzle. You need good common sense,  for the objects around you. And I especially love the feature (SMALL SPOILER) where you can sniff out your mother's foot steps to find her, as this is a great way to tell players where to go. Its really confusing, but has a great storyline. It really is nothing else, but you could get Shelter 2 if you'd like an actual game similar to this. And yes I did cry in Shelter 2 where one of my cubs, almost grown :( died. It is a pretty hard game, indeed, but if one cub dies, it affects (SMALL SPOILER, again) the family tree in the game. As I said, Paws, is more for a story, where you will certainly cry (If you won't, you have a demonic heart) and even though Shelter 2 doesn't have a story, it can still make you cry, as you work so hard for your cubs, just to see the perish. A little off-topic warning: Games with a 'juicy' story like this, can have people who are recommending, say spoilers. Thats why I don't really read any of them, just look at what percentage. I'd say for a game like this, 80 percent and above is fine. 90 percent, is an extremely good game. In other games, like something you play with, not enfold a story, 75 and above is perfect. Just a little thing about games, dont read comments on games with a thick, juicy story, as they do spoil parts, and always check the percentages!"

But there were too many drawbacks keeping me from actually enjoying it.This game might be more aptly titled ""Lost in the Woods Simulator 2016"". The dizzying watercolors of the environment mixed with similar-themed areas make it very difficult to find your way. There is a 'sense' mode where you can sniff to try and find your mother, and sometimes her paw prints will appear in a trail, showing you the way. My issue with this was that 1) these hints didn't appear often enough for me and 2) when they did appear, it was extremely difficult to tell which way they were leading. I spent way too much time just walking around in circles, trying to find my way.The controls are not explained very well, not even if you explicitly go into the keybindings menu. When I found the baby bear and it was clear he was hungry and I had to feed him in order to wake him up, I had SUCH a difficult time figuring out how to pick up food and bring it to him without eating it myself.If it wasn't for the confusion completely jarring me out of the experience, both through the environment and the keybindings (I was playing with an Xbox controller btw), it would be a really cute game. I feel that either the implementation of a minimap or a clear idea of which direction's the mother lynx's paw prints are going would at the very least make this a less painful game to play."

From the main protagonist to even the things that's supposed to be your enemy they are extremely cute. The story follows a lynx cub gets lost from his/her mother and teams up with a bear cub to find her again. That isn't a bad story idea, but you know what else isn't a bad idea?Pros:-this game is extremely cute- It was fun, short lived entertainment.- The graphic design was fairly decent.- The story is a basic formula, but hey! No dying cats this time!... unless you count the missing cub at the end.- I like the easter eggs.Cons:- The camera and controls are downright AWFUL. I'm supposed to be looking for my bear buddy but my lynx is doing 9,000 backflips and the camera is having a seziure!- The game is too short. If I don't count the times I got stuck this game could be completed within 1.2 hours.- The graphics are also very hard to look at sometimes. I remember I got stuck for a while because I thought a bush was apart of the ground.Overall, should you play this? It's pretty much matter of opinion. If you liked the original Shelter games, you might enjoy this Shelter 2 spinoff. Or if you like nature games or lynxes it's also a possibility you might like this.

But this game tells a magnificent story of friendship. Also family. This by far is one of the best games I have played. I might get the DLC soon, but for now, I`ll stick with the main game. Might and Delight; You are amazing, in every way possible.Here is a quick summary of the game: (spoilers)So you start out as a baby lynx, the story starts when your mom just gave birth to you. It is like the shelter 2 opening, but in first person in baby Inna's eyes. After a day or two (I think?) you, your siblings and your mom go outside to hunt. After you are done hunting you go back into the den. At night you and your mom go to a star  Once your are done looking at it, you go back to the den. Next morning, it seems that you are moving out. sadly you get stuck in the lake and you are tooken miles away from your family.You explore a creepy forest (rainforest?) and you have to smell your mom's foot steps. Then you meet some swans, but not in the best way. they throw you around if you get too close. Once you get passed them you go up the mountain(I don't belive it was a mountain, actually). At the top of this mountain(or ledge) you find a bear, ineed of food. before you saw the bear, wasn't there berries before you saw him? go get them! or if you are feeling evil you can feed him a bird.  Feed him three of the berries.Once you have him following you, you go on an adventure with him. you'll bump into a misty area. There is a small hole only you can fit into. try to find a way in for the bear. which means leave him behind for now. Once you find a wayy in- wait, there is a fox after you! run! Bam. You got caught. But the bear rushes in and kills the fox. he brings you to a safe place, and gives you a fish to eat.Now you are awake. Finally. You keep on going on your adventure. Wait- your bear ran away somewhere. Follow him. What is he looking at? Is that another bear? No... to small. It is your mom! But that means you have to leave your friend behind. Once you get back to your mom, keep on meowing, you can still hear him, but now you can't. The en- wait! You wake up in the middle of the night, go to the star, and you can see him. You can even meow, he roars back happily.Edit: I did leave out a alot of things, and also I found out that you can escape the fox.Edit 2: Also, sorry if I made a few spelling mistakes, I just type fast, I guess. Also I wanted to move on to something after this review."

Might and Delight truly have a big imagination.This game is where you play as a lynx cub. The story-line is pretty sad, but I won't spoil!If you don't like sad games, this game is not for you. However, if you can deal with it, its ok.I played this over and over again, paying close attention to the characters and plot. I think the characters are pretty cool, and also they made the swans a villain for one part.Making another cub a friend with the lynx cub(not spoiling what animal), it fits perfectly together. The graphics are beautiful!This game is worth the $14.99. Plus, if you own Shelter 2 you get a small discount on it!Any bad review on this game should be ignored, because this game is great!Warning: You may cry in both endings.Yeah, there's an alternative ending.

,Recommended,434000,34183231,Posted: 11 August,all,Momolove,"I had loved the first and second games, and I also decided to get this game. From the trailers, I decided it was a game where you played as a lynx cub, stayed with your family, escaped danger, and grow up and leave your mother. Then you would survive on your own, find a mate, and leave them to raise your family. Then you would have to play Shelter 2. I was so wrong. Below is the story, which I recommend not reading for the game is best going in blind.In Paws you play as a lynx cub, with you lynx family. Any new player would immediatly get attached with their family, for you play around with your siblings and follow your mother. After sleeping on the second day, you wake up near dawn to see your mother walking away from the den. You follow your mother  up a hill and see a star. After looking at the star for a while, it floats into the sky. Then you and your mother go to sleep.When you wake up its all cloudy. You follow your mother out of the den, over a log, and then the story progresses. Then its raining. You and your siblings are most likely either scared, tired, or hungry, for when you meow, you sound more depressed.Then you come across a river. Your mother picks you up and walks across it, your siblings swimming along. Then a wave washes you out of your mother's grasp. You get stunned in the water for a second when you start to swim along. Your mother picks up one of your siblings and the other two make it onto shore. But then another wave comes. Your mother puts the other cub on the shore and runs after you. The wave then washes you away before your mother can grab you.You then wake up and proceed to search for your family. After traveling, following your family's footprints, and resting, you wake up due to a pack of hunting wolves. You run along, and meet a bear cub. After feeding it three birds or berries, it will become strong again and follow you around, helping you.At some point of your search, you'll come to a foggy area. If you sniff around, you can find a hidden 'ghost' of your family.  But a fox is also among the ghost, and in it the fox seems to be hunting your other three siblings. Then you go through a tunnel and need to find a way for your bear friend to follow you. You then will enter a foggy bit, and music will start playing. There are platforms that you can jump onto, which is important to do because the fox will attempt to attack you.If you get attacked, then the screen will go black and you can hear the fox biting into the cub when the bear suddenly attacks it and chases the fox off. You will then wake up in a den that the bear brought you two. It will leave and come back with a fish. The bear then drops the fish and covers the den with branches to camoflauge it.When you wake up you will walk along as normal but then your friend will run off. If you follow the bear, then you will come across a river.Across the river is your mother and two of your siblings. Here you have the choice. Swim across the river to your family or stay with your bear friend. If you go with your mother, then everytime you try to go back your mother will pick you up. If you go with your bear friend, your friend will eat one berry bushes and you go through them to go to a den. It also is possible to go with your mother and when she goes to sleep with your siblings, you can go across the river to your bear and go with the bear ending, but only if you had your friend eat the bushes first.At the ending, you climb up a hill and see a star come down. You will see who you left behind, which I found heartbreaking.Strangly, the other Shelter games didn't make me cry when a cub died or when I got to the ending. But when I got to the ending of Paws for the first time, I cried. Even when I see the ending now, I still feel sad. Its pretty rare for a game to make me cry, and even more rare for me to feel the same feeling at the same part over and over again."

The camera was not as good as in the orignal Shelter 2 game, which bothered me a bit, but eventually I got used to it. The story is nicely told and there a lot collectibles to be found, which takes some time. It is manageable however, which I appreciate. I'm not a fan of collectibles that you have to get out of the orignal way of gameplay to acheive. Luckily, this is not the case here. You do have to play the game 2-3 times though to get them all. But I liked the story very much.The only thing I didn't find as satisfying was the ending, as there is no real ending. I thought that I would get to see how Inna grew up completely (and the bear cub with her), but the story ends as soon as you find your family again. Which I found a bit disappointing. But overall I liked the game and would recommend it to fans of the series as a nice add-on."

76561197971739421,Recommended,434000,29536902,Posted: 28 January,all,Zergling Rush Of Adorableness!,"Yet another beautiful game in the Shelter series and like the others, Paws is both simplistic and emotional. It dishes out a delightful story that sticks true to nature and really puts you in the 'paws' of your lynx cub character.The game is perfectly made in every way. I mean, cute little mewling sounds are just so darn adorable. But there are a couple of cons to this that in no way made me think bad or even get annoyed at it. Just slight inconveniences really.The controls are a tad oversensitive when controlling the camera. This can take a little time getting used to but every game has its unique feel and Paws certainly gives you plenty of breathing room to master the controls.If you, like me, love going for achievements too, just be aware the game will only reward you the ones you've earned once you've shut down the game. This makes it hard, especially for the puff ball achievement, to keep track of how many you've knocked off.I found this game to have no real challenge, just simple fun. The previous Shelter games did have more challenges to them. This doesn't change my love for this game, however I do wish there were points in it that enacted serious danger to both characters to put across how deadly the real world is to young cubs alone in the wild.Overall a delightful game, beautiful storyline, and certainly pulls on the emotional strings to your heart. I highly recommend this game if you love playing as animals. You don't have to worry about playing the other Shelter games as they all have separate stories. This game is very short but the enjoyment goes on forever. Give it a try!Also, beware the swans. Those buggers are nasty! ;)"

I bought this to unlock some content in meadow, which has stolen my life, and because you play as a lynx, which is one of my favorite animals and never gets any love.Pros:-Great storytelling so far-Love the art style-Fairly straightforward gameplay-Not terribly stressful (unless it is luring me into a false sense of security...)Cons-I also got jumpscared by geese-Some world limit bugs that force a reload (which may or may not be quite a ways back): have had to do this twice after getting stuck in a rock or, in one case, jumped on the bear's back in an inappropriate place and ended up walking through/into a wall-The Camera is annoying and unhelpful. I'm not sure why this is since it worked fine once changed to ""static"" mode in other M&D game.-Easy to get lost/go in circles in some places.-I thought the bear cub was a wolf and snuck around it. <_<"

I am stuck in the forest with the swans, and that one jump really high up on the cliff? I can't make it. I've tried every way imaginable, i can't. After an hour, the lag usually sets in and I can't play at all. This game is frustrating. It tries to be all atmospheric but with it literally being the most frustrating game I've ever played, it's just getting more frustrating. I have the game open right now, and since we can't save whenever we want I'm going to be jumping that cliff for a while.I can't just go back to the cliff, because the forest is SO CONFUSING that I won't be able to find it again. Don't get me started on the controls. Those are so wonky that I can barely control the lynx. Other people may be able to make that jump, but i suck at parkour.

Although it would be nice to have like a 25% (get it cuz theres 4 cubs) chance to not be the white cub and see what the journey is like with your mother missing the white cub. Or if this happens and you play as the orange cub (who gets killed by the fox) you can escape him and meet the white one with all three cubs alive. Well if you read this devolpers, can you consider it?1 downside is that when you pick your mother at the end your bear friend sounds really sad as you leave and appears as a spirit it made me cry at both occurances"

I enjoyed the storyline, not gonna lie, I shed a few tears at the end. The poetry, soundtrack and artstyle make the game flow very nicely. recommend playing Shelter 2 first though, there's some extra lore relating to Inna. Although I loved the game the camera angles were very wonky most of the time.For example, I only knew the fox was chasing me until he got me!Some of the time the world felt very ""open"" and I spent a lot of time going around in circles trying to find where to go next. The game is realitivily short and the ending can be enterpeted in many diffrent ways, but I enjoyed it overall."

The controls, camera and visual rotations are very bad and it made the game much harder to navigate. Please fix these glitches since they do significantly impede on the game’s performance and sometimes makes you lost (or at least for me). Otherwise, it’s a game that needs to be played at least twice to be fully appreciated.  It’s a nice concept and not too long. However it’s not really as open world as you’d think because you are very limited on where to go in some places. Overall it's pretty charming and explores some interesting themes such as life/death, relationships/friends and some supernatural spirits (no pun intended)."

Especially annoying that swan!Beautiful game, amazing soundtrack, well worth the money, another title to keep where it's nice and warm - close to your heart.9/10 ;-)"
