,Not Recommended,434020,22400563,"Posted: 13 April, 2016",all,AgreedSA,"Update! The devs have promised a patch to overhaul the whole control scheme. As that was my biggest gripe with the game, I'm considering giving it another shot once this patch hits, as I still think some of the ideas on display are interesting. Looking forward to a second chance for this title. I'll reevaluate my opinion on the grind of the game once I can play the levels without control frustration.Review:***[Beta PATCH to address CONTROLS ISSUE out, haven't played updated game yet though.]***There are a lot of things I don't like about this game, but the thing I like the least is that it's a frustratingly poor mobile port. Most things you'd want to ""tap twice"" to do on a tablet or phone still require two inputs, but it's ridiculous here - double type? Ok... And the control scheme is kinda garbage. There will be moments when you want to respond quickly to changing situations, but can't, because the controls inhibit your intentions.The awkwardness of the user interface will be most noticeable when you're trying to do anything quickly. You'll be frustrated trying to place towers suddenly when a level's spawn layout changes after no prior warning (which is a mediocre design choice in my opinion, and forces you to build from the red line at the end of the level outward unless you want to get screwed on mobs slipping through your suddenly compromised defenses). The controls also suck when trying to get your hero to target enemies, either for their regular plink damage attacks or for their timed abilities. Also, the timed abilities are a little random in how they deal damage sometimes, which is difficult to square with the ""Tower Defense"" genre concept in my opinion. Shouldn't be very luck based at all.There are a lot of things to grind out that make your towers or hero suck a little less, but at least in the early game it's just a grindy slog. Nothing in what I played so far to give you that ""oh hell yeah"" feeling some other games give you when you unlock a new tower type, no real decisions to make about how to specialize anything - just basic upgrades to basic attributes. I'd love this system if it had more choices in customization, maybe some exclusive choices to specialize a tower more. I dunno, I like that in other games of this kind and feel it might add some legs to the upgrade system to have even just one branching option at the end of an upgrade tree - make a choice, player, and enjoy the rewards.Why am I bothering to make suggestions for a game I didn't even really like the first time I owned it? Well, the devs responded, and appear to be making a genuine good faith effort to work on areas that I personally found frustrating, and their communication with this review chain has given me some real faith that what we have here isn't a bad mobile port, but the makings of a Good Mobile Port, maybe even something that can find unique excellence on the PC platform if they continue to develop it and continue to pay attention to player response."

Awesome price point. At 4$ you cannot go wrong.The long:If you like Kingdom Rush you will absolutely love this game.It takes upgrading way deeper including hero upgrades in both skills and gear. There are multiple heroes to choose from all with their own individual skill sets,equipment and playstyles. You can even control multiple heroes, if you wish.The towers are filled deeply with upgrade trees of their own and there is a decent selection of towers currently to choose from.The game is in early access and the devs behind this not only listen to their customer base but implements what they have asked for. It's nice and refreshing to see an early access project where the devs don't crowd source just to end up abandoning the game.These guys are actually serious about Last Hope and it's clearly reflected in the state of their current product.Highly recommended."
76561197995011578,Recommended,434020,22415941,"Posted: 14 April, 2016",all,Shadus,"Keep in mind: if this were more expensive, this would be a negative review.  That being said, this game is definately good for at least the $1/hour expectation.However... if you're looking for a good TD that will make you feel challenged, this probably isn't it.While the hero system has some merit with six different heroes (with a seventh available waaaaay too late to be worth mentioning), with both talents and gear to help you customize your play,,, that works as both an advantage and a disadvantage.  In many cases, you'll have to farm excessive amounts of currency to unlock a hero, then unlock his/her gear, then upgrade said gear... only to THEN have to level up that hero to be useful.  Given how slow leveling is, and how dull farming currency is, that's a monumental task.  Especially given that some heros don't work the way you'd expect them to just reading their stats.But the real crime here is the towers themselves.Often times towers will fail to target correctly - either focusing on a slow mob that moved into range first while letting one or more faster ones slip by, or simply not hitting mobs because of strange line-of-sight issues.  For instance, an AoE tower might hit one mob at the back of a pack, but not hit the rest of the pack at all.Worse still, however, is for the many tens of thousands of currency you might sink into fully upgrading a tower... most of the game can be dominated with two tower types.  And no, they're not the advanced ones.  The most powerful tower seems to be spamming a certain, fully upgraded basic tower... and then adding in an anti-air turret if you have flyers.For the most part, after about 5-6 hours, the game starts to feel repetitious... and I'm wondering if I have the fortitude to actually finish it."
,Not Recommended,434020,33942212,Posted: 31 July,all,Tman,"This game had a lot going for it. The first 5-10 hours, it was a fairly enjoyable Tower Defense game. As you are leveling, and buying new things, everything feels OK. Challenging levels, many different variants of levels including several ""arenas"" where you can try your luck on a single map where other variables will change.The story is pretty decent as far as games go. They aren't going to win any pulitzer prizes, but it's serviceable and progresses the game.Towers, the heart & sole of Tower Defense, come in many varieties, but you'll find yourself using such a low number of these, because of the upgrade costs,  that all the spots they give you maps will go empty.Pathing is a big problem in this game. You aren't told the paths that enemies will take, and you will constantly be starting over levels because of a new path that the zombies will take around your defenses. I hate games where I have to play several times just to memorize the paths. So many TD games give you the paths they will take with a simple key that I'm surprised they didn't include this. I guess they consider this a game mechanic. Oh, and levels will change on you from one try to the next.Where the game falls apart is the end-game and the leveling mechanic for the heroes. It's quite obvious this game started out as a Free / low cost with a store to buy yourself credits for additional $$. The problem is when they ported this to Steam, while they removed the store, they didn't adjust any of the exponential cost / experience required for leveling heroes.So I went through all levels on Normal, then again on Hard, and I've done about 15 levels on nightmare. I have 2 heroes leveled all the way to 25, and two more that are level 23.I just don't see the point of continuing. I'm close to getting to level 25, but the repetition is absolutely killing me. It's not fun.With the upgrade paths for both towers and heros, you can just grind yourself through the game. You don't have to try any new strategy, you just need to level up your hero and towers. This is a flaw IMO because lack of repeatability means I'm not sure I'm doing good or not. Also, it's impossible to give any specific advice to people because of the variation of heroes and towers with the leveling mechanic means that you and someone else will not have the same things, so any advice on levels is just not going to work.Another negative is the implementation of the endless levels - if I could pick a game with the absolute worst endless mode, Last Hope would be that game. Every 5 levels the game wipes half your towers. It's absolutely not recoverable from and the randomness of it really is super frustrating - I never did play any more levels after the first few forays.If this game is on sale for $1.99 or cheaper during a steam sale, go for it, but don't get hung up on the hero leveling or upgrading towers. Just pick a few towers (poison, sniper, farmer & air defense) and that's all you really need."
,Not Recommended,434020,26758471,"Posted: 22 November, 2016",all,kumori,"For you to know if your game preferences aligns with mine: I play a lot of TD and I love hunting that last 100% achievements. I like strategy over clickfest. I like unique td mechanics and difficulty that forces you to try many strategies before succeeding.After 50+ hours (sounds like a lot, I might have left it on running during night or something) and 100% steam achievements (which are different from the in-game achievments of which I have 94/154).The dev(s?) seems to be very active and you can feel there is heart in the game. Artstyle is nice and stylish and the theme is consistent.But even if I really want to like this game, I feel it's a very dull and average tower defense.It's a progression fest with ""go back and level up your hero and come back when you are ready"". I think that can work very well, but in TD's it generally means that ""none of those levels were balanced for you, we just used a steadily increasing algorithm to control the pace"".So I gambled and leveled my poison towers first, and then the advanced 2x2 tower, and later the anti-air. And most of the time I just pressed fast forward and watched the game fly by. The first 80%-90% of the game was just so incredibly easy. Did I get lucky with my tower picks? I'm more inclined to believe this is some futile attempt to reward the achievement-hunter in me. And trust me, I love that kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥ but there has to besomechallenge! I never changed my tower setup all game through. Not once. And I never used any of the ""defensive"" towers/tents.I randomly looked at some monster stats and found one saying ""This monster is immune to stun."".This sure sounds like an attempt to force a situation where the player should switch up his towers.Instead the reaction you get is ""Oh, there is a stunning tower? Good thing I never used it!"".And I believe that really defines this game. The lack of strategy. If you can go whatever random tower loadout and still breeze through the game I think there is a problem. I think you need more situational towers. Yes that could gimp people who invest too much in the wrong towers, but I still feel it would be more fun than this.So what if there is 50+ monsters? If all I can even remember afterwards was a fast monster and a fat exploding one, what does it matter? Oh yeah there was flying one as well. My bad. And how many levels was that? About 50 x 2 modes x 3 difficulties? I would take 10 good levels over the 140 bad ones any day.It's not all bad though. I really liked hunting the last ""graveyard something something"" achievement.I found joy in controlling four heroes, swapping them around at different spots and then going back and leveling upthose heroes up to meet the next difficult challenge. But to be honest, those levels were WITHOUT towers!! So don't come and tell me there was any tower strategy involved.So for what it's worth I think this game works best when it does it's own no-towers hero-defense-kinda-thing. I also enjoyed the two ""mini-MOBA"" maps quite a lot.But the actual tower defense maps? Meh. Sorry. Not for me."

In this game, however, it is quite a good thing. This is a very entertaining tower defense game and the level of customization really makes it enjoyable. It requires quite a bit of grinding on the same levels a few times if you desire to get advanced skills/towers but that is to be expected."

There are a handful in at the moment which should be enough for now.This appears to have been a mobile game before but it seems put well together for PC as there are keys binded to abilities and such, there are also graphics options but honestly they don't make much difference. There are also NO microtransactions which is a + regardless of whether they were in the Mobile version or not.--Conclusion--It's a tower defence game with some unique elements, if you're a fan of TD's then you should check this game out, if not but don't mind them then still check it out. I give the game a 8/10 Mainly because I'm not the biggest fan but I don't see why other people won't enjoy this game if they are a fan since it has a fair bit going for it especially at the price and having no content locked away behind Microtransactions.

You aren't facing thousands of monsters... every zombie counts.  Every zombie past the red line means a settler's life lost.This game breathes freshness into the stale land of tower defense with a unique western setting & storyline combined with fun graphics & entertaining gameplay.Pros+ Fun graphics and very different kind of setting -- I like the native American theme with the desert locations.+ The music is very cool, kind of a rock-western theme that's very atmospheric.+ Plenty of hotkeys for turrets & your heroes.+ Indicators let you know which towers can be upgraded, (when you have enough currency & the levels unlocked).+ Research system allows you to prioritize different attributes of your towers, granting permanent bonuses.+ Towers have some very cool & funky special upgrades like: an extra flame thrower that can be mounted on the arrow turret, and a golem that spawns from the slowing tower!  (Nice variety of specialized towers, too!)+ Western/zombie storyline... with a twist! -- very different from typical TD games.+ Several heroes to choose from, each with their own weapon types & abilities.+ Several optional side quest lines that have rewards of new heroes, etc., which pose further challenges.+ Forgiving star system -- 1 or 2 zombies let through don't necessarily negate a 3-star win.+ Playing maps on different difficulty/modes changes the entrances/goals of each map adding variety and replayability.+ End-game, Nightmare Mode, definitely adds challenge!Neutral~ For each level, pathing has branches, and never know which route mobs will take.  In some cases, this requires a restart of the level, but in general, it just keeps you thinking on your toes.~ No upgrade preview in-map for what stats will be improved for each tower when upgrading.Cons- Cannot build/queue special abilities when paused.  There is a short break between waves however.- When a zombie crosses the line, the screen shakes and it's quite jarring.- After finishing the normal campaign, you'll find yourself with many upgrades to buy and heroes to level.  End-game is kinda grindy working toward those things.  However... it took about 16 hours to get to that point, so I am well satisfied with my experience :-)There are other things that make this game special -- the use of dust blowing across the screen to indicate fast-forward of time, an urgency to gameplay. The story is very fun indeed, and has a cool ending.  (I won't spoil it for you!)One thing I found slightly frustrating is the tower slots... for a VERY long time, you are only allowed to use 3 towers.  You own all these cool towers, but can only choose up to 3 per map.  Even then, there are occasional desires for one-of's... like a single sentry to pick off the fast guys.  Eventually you can unlock 6 total tower slots, but by that time, you tend to already have your favorites set in stone.Overall, I have seriously enjoyed this game.  Very unusual & unique.

It doesn't show you where you can build towers unless you've selected a tower to build, so it's hard to plan your defense while enemies are attacking. It's very unclear what path the enemies will take. Enemies will suddenly start appearing from a new entrance, but if your camera is zoomed in and that entrance isn't on screen, you won't know that this is happening. The towers sometimes  target the enemy closest to them, rather than the enemy closest to the goal, allowing enemies to get by. There is some fun to be had with this game, but there are definitely better tower defense games to choose from"

On normal difficulty very causal at first, but more difficult levels start to appear towards the end. There could be more variety what comes to turrets.  Graphics are sufficient, but nothing amazing. The game offers (at least) three difficulty modes, more difficult version of each level and also some arena style levels, which you can repeat several times while the difficult slowly rises. In short, there's nice amount of content. Character development elements also work great.Recommend."

,Not Recommended,434020,24204765,"Posted: 9 July, 2016",all,Fishzerg,"This game doesn't meet the standard I expect in games, and especially not in tower defense. After playing a game like Kingdom Rush, this game falls short in every aspect (while essentially trying to do the same thing). As a tower defense game it doesn't introduce any new elements and feels rushed: you can't see where to place towers unless you click on a construct button - which is unfortunate when you need to place one quickly. The towers are very similar in appearance and if built next to eachother are even hard to click on when you try to select just one (for example if you want to upgrade or sell it). Many towers in the same area looks like a huge mess, especially when additional upgrade icons appear (which they do once you have enough cash for an upgrade) - the icons are the same size as the towers themselves. Towers seem to be exactly the same: can't tell a difference between a tower that shoots single arrows to target one enemy, and a tower that is good against groups. The latter still shoots a single arrow that targets a single enemy. No impact observed graphically.As a game in general, this falls short in graphics where animations look ugly and really non-smooth, both in cutscenes and the game itself. There is no resolution option. The story is boring, and naive. Can't stand games that drop a few lines just to provide some sort of context. If you do something, at least try to make something of it, or don't do it at all. The game just feels very quickly put together and unfinished.I think you should instead play Kingdom Rush if you haven't. This game looks like a very cheap copy of it, put in a different context. I guess if you really like tower defense and have finished most of the games that exist in this genre, Last Hope might be sort of enjoyable if you can look past all of its flaws. But I still would rather play Kingdom Rush one more time."

This is completely the opposite of how anyone who has played RTSes or TDs regularly would expect it to behave, leading to lots of frustrating situations.Extremely awkward way of confirming tower placement (clicking on the tower type assumes you want to click and drag it somewhere rather than just click once to select and click again to place, like every other TD game in existence) and purchasing (double type... wtf?!?).No standard control conventions seem to be observed even though overall those same commands aren't otherwise being utilized (even simple things like allowing you to select a building and set a rally point using right click)Escape brings you to pause menu, but doesn't take you back out of it, you have to click the ""play"" button.These issues might not be so bad if you could manipulate the game while paused, but fighting with the control scheme in real time quickly becomes aggrivating in situations where you need to react quickly.There really is no excuse for the reliance on drag-and-drop, double typing, and seemingly forgetting that there aretwomouse buttons."
