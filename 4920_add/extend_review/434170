Also fantastic new game additions!My only gripe would be that this version seems more 'Americanised' than Jackbox 2, me and my mate both agree there should be the ability to turn off specifically American questions, or at least have more ""General"" questions. We went through a lot of questions in Jackbox 3 that we had absolutely no idea about, which kind of brought the mood down a little which we never found in Jackbox 2.Still love this game though, can't wait to play it again this weekend!"

,Recommended,434170,28522819,"Posted: 21 December, 2016",all,ItsLeAshton,"This pack is my Close 2nd Favorite Jackbox Party Pack, with Party Pack 2 being #1. The trailer is right, this pack is truly INSANE. From Designing Custom T-Shirts, to Trying to stay alive while answering trivia questions, to answering silly prompts such as ""An item on every pervert's grocery list"", this pack is bound to thrill you, make you laugh, and get hours of fun worth! This pack is definitely worth all the money! This pack is home to Fakin' It, Quiplash 2, Guesspionage, Trivia Murder Party, and Tee K.O.In Trivia Murder Party, you answer hundreds of trivia questions while competing against friends to stay alive. Whenever you're wrong, you'll have to compete in minigames that will decide your fate. One of my favorites in the pack!In Guesspionage, you try to guess the percentage, or whether it is higher or lower than the chosen percentage of things such as ""How many people have worn a clown suit to atleast one birthday party?"". This is quite a unique concept, although this game isn't as fun as most of the things in this pack.In Quiplash 2, you are given over hundreds of prompts in which you have to come up with hilarious answers for, and those answers will be put against someone else's answers, and the others will have to vote on which answer is the best. My 2nd favorite game in the pack!In Tee K.O, you must draw any random drawings you choose onto T-Shirts, and then write a whole bunch of silly slogans, and then other people will randomize shirts and prompts of their opponents whilst you do the same, and then all of the T-Shirts are put against each other, and everyone must vote on which one is the best. Only one T-Shirt makes it out alive, this is definitely my favorite game in the pack, and my 2nd Favorite Jackbox Game ever, first being Bidiots.In Fakin' It, you must be in the same room as everyone playing with you. You must also know them atleast somewhat well. You have to do things such as put your hands up if you've done something, similar to Truth or Dare, or point to someone whom matches a prompt given, etc. It's a really unique game, though I have only played it once, so I can't give much detail about it.Thanks for reading my review! This game is DEFINITELY worth it! Recommended for sure! :D"

It is by far the most ambitious, polished set of games so far, and without a doubt Party Pack 3 has the strongest games in the series. Trivia Murder Party is especially great to play, and it can get very intense. Now that I'm in college, it's awesome to go to the game lounge and set it up on the TV.

Some of them are especially greatTrivia Murder Party is great fun and tense as well-it really makes you double guess your own actions and your friends actions.Quiplash 2 is just as great as the original, probably better in fact. You can write your own prompts and the game is just improved in every way I can think of.Tee K.O. is an interesting concept of a game, where you design a few t-shirts and then come up with a few random titles-someone else will pair the two and then it will be voted on and the person who paired them will win, not the person who designed it, which we found odd but interesting. This doesn't make the game any less fun though, it is a great gameFakin' It is also a good game-however, you need to be able to see each other perfectly. Considering we were playing over Skype and therefore I could only see one person at a time because I was sharing my screen, this made the game a bit more difficult and so we agreed to say what we would do. It is an interesting game though, where there a different rounds that you can pick-for example, you will have to write something, hold up a certain number of fingers or point at someone. Everyone gets given the same prompt to do something, apart from the faker who either gets given a roughly similar prompt (for example in the writing round, one prompt was ""the last book you read"" whereas the fakers was ""your favourite childhood book"") or no prompt at all and they just have to try a persuade people that they are not the faker. However I am not entirely certain how the points system works.Another good point is that once you have finished the game and select to play again with the same players, it will remember and you will not have to sit through the introduction again-in fact, in the Trivia Murder Party this is incoperated into the game and if you lost in the previous game-and thus ""died""-it will add ""Jr"" to the end of your name.As well as this when you log onto the Jackbox.tv website and join a game, the format of the webpage will change dependent on what game you are playing, which is a nice feature.You also have the ability to look at the answers at the end of the game via the webpage. In Tee K.O. It even gives you the option of buying the T-Shirts that everyone so lovingly designed.All in all, another great Jackbox Party Pack that is super fun to play with friends, with new more experimental games that are just great fun to play with your friends."

,Recommended,434170,33242237,Posted: 4 July,all,N-Nani?!,"So I’m going to base this review on my personal and my friends’ opinions when we got to play the game together, this is going to be a partial review because we didn’t play Fakin it as I’ve read from reviews that the game isn’t fun at all.Overall, the game is really enjoyable to play with your friends for a couple of hours, this game brought us some laugh out loud moments and really gives you that feeling of togetherness when you have your friends over. What’s great about The Jackbox Party Pack is that you don’t need to prepare anything like extra controllers or anything like that to play with multiple friends on the couch; all you need is a laptop, an internet connection, and smartphones which I’m sure everyone has. What I also like about this game is that it caters to everyone; be it your family or friends, and is relatively easy to get into, as friends who watched for just a couple of minutes would already understand how each game goes (some of my friends aren't really good at english). Now, on to each individual game the pack offers;Quiplash;This game is the ultimate source of laugh out loud moments that you can have with your friends since it gives you the option to make your own prompts where you can add some inside jokes that are sure to give your group a good laugh.Trivia Murder Party;This game has the longest lasting appeal as me and friends have played this game over and over for hours without getting bored. However, as many of the consumers have stated, the trivias are mostly ‘American’ trivias that most people who lived outside the US won’t get. For example, the game asks which presidents where democrats and which of these people were once hosts of a show like Family Feud. It’s a damn shame because I really wanted my friends to not get confused 80% of the time by these questions and actually have a clue of what they should choose as the answer.Guesspionage;As you can probably tell from the name of the game, this is a game about guessing, as in guessing percentages. The guessing happens the whole game, it gets boring fast and it doesn’t really give you any sense of competition or achievement when you actually win the game since it basically crowns the best guesser.Tee K.O.;My review for this game will be taken by a quote from my friend; “If we drew the shirts and make all the words, why is our shirt just mixed pictures and words taken from someone else’s efforts?”. This game isn’t fun because all your hard work will be used by someone else to win the game and even if you win, you won’t win by using your own drawings; this game is unsatisfactory and the scoring system is really confusing.TL;DR, Get this game for Quiplash and Trivia Murder Party, and get it if you have friends who aren’t really into games but is looking to meet up and have fun, or if you have any friends at all for that matter."

,Recommended,434170,28702382,"Posted: 26 December, 2016",all,The Cloon,"Long time fan of the You Dont Know Jack series, so I was interested in the Jackboxes as soon as I saw them.  Ive played dozens of games from each Jackbox, and while I fully recommend the first two at the low price point, I think this one, while great,  isn't worth it until its discounted.FYI: I have 50+ hours played, not the 1.4 it shows here...I play on a laptop connected to TV doesnt show i guess.The Good:- Custom Games - You can make your own questions... so if you are like me and starting to get repeat questions, you can make your own!- Quiplash 2 - Quiplash XL was always a party favorite with guests in the previous jackbox, and this one doesnt disappoint!- Trivia Murder Party - A new entry in the series, and its great!  Took a couple games to really understand the mechanics, but our group had a blast with it... some really great and exciting close games the way they end.- Guesspionage - Another new entry... Simple and fun game with lot of surprises and its more challenging than it seems.The Bad:- No Fibbage - would have liked to see a new Fibbage in, this was a standout game- Tee K.O. - Mediocre at best... the concept is ok, where you come up with funny slogans and draw T-Shirts, but half the stuff you draw and come up with doesnt get used in the game.  Also, the mechanics and scoring dont make sense... instead of a tournament style matchups, its just 2 random shirts, one gets voted off, and a new ""challenger"" shirt gets thrown in.  points for longest streak, and winner... problem is if your shirt comes out last, your max streak can only be 1, and if your shirt is first, highly unlikely everyone will keep voting for it to win, so it didnt make much sense.  we played a few games and moved on, wont bother unless it gets revamped in the future.The Ugly- No You Dont Know Jack??  Why a YDKJ episide wasnt included in a Jackbox, WTH?- Fakin It - wow, what a mess.  Pass on this turd, we tried it a few times, and our group mutually agreed it was definitely the loser of the bunch.Fortunately with 5 games included, its still worth getting even with one or two average or crap games, cause three are super fun with unlimited potential with the new ability to make up custom questions... well worth the price of a 12 pack of beer for the hours of entertainment value, so I still very much recommend."

Using phones as controllers is a great idea and I wish more games would do this sort of thing. If you have friends that have at least a bit of sense of humor, get it and it will make for a great party.My only complaint about the game is that the Trivia one is filled with very US pop culture heavy questions and most of the global audience will be completely in the dark (and there is many of them).What I would wish for future releases is some sort of fleshed out trivia game where you could maybe choose the categories for the particular session. I wouldn't mind getting DLCs of this sort of thing either,"

,Recommended,434170,26327818,"Posted: 30 October, 2016",all,Daklog,"I've played the previous Jackbox Party Pack games, and they were both GREAT! So, how does this one hold up? I'm here to tell you that.1st Game: Quiplash 2Quiplash 2 is a sequel to the highly successful game, Quiplash. You find some prompts on your phone, and you try to write down the funniest thing you can think of that may or may not relate to the prompt. Some new features have been added to this version, like the ability to make your own prompts, and the ability to kick those nasty trolls.2nd Game: Trivia Murder PartyTrivia Murder Party is a trivia game that is very similar to You Don't Know Jack, although this game is mainly about trivia, it also will give you a chance to play a minigame if you get one wrong. These minigames will range from answering math questions, making the longest word, or even drinking from a random challice that may or may not contain poison. This game also has a singleplayer feature, so you can have fun even if your friends can't visit... or maybe you might not have any friends, I don't know your life. But, the singleplayer mode is just as good as the multiplayer. Perfect for your Halloween parties or any other party.3rd Game: Fakin' ItWARNING: This game involves lying to your friends and family, so be cautious.Fakin' It is a game where you are either telling truth, or forced to lie. The game is best played in a Living Room or Game Room and not through a private stream with your friends, because you actually have to see the people around you. There are up to 6 people in this game, and one of them is a liar. People get a prompt on their phone, which will say something like ""Who here would be likely to have a fetish for mermaids?"" or ""Raise your hand if you've seen Regular Show The Movie"" and you would have to do a certain action. The actions include raising your hand, pointing to another player, holding up a number, or making a face. The liar will not get the prompt and will only be told to do the action. People have to guess who the liar is.4th Game: GuesspionageThis game involves percentages and guessing. The player in the ""hotseat"" will guess what percentage of people have done a certain action, the others will try to guess if the percentage is higher or lower... and that's pretty much it. Not much to say  about this one.5th Game: Tee K.O.This game is a battle between novelty t-shirts to see which person is the best t-shirt designer. All people have 4 minutes and 30 seconds to draw 3 pictures and 30 seconds to type as many catchy slogans as possible. When this is all done, everyone's designs and slogans are switched around, and people have to match up the funniest combo and slap it on their t-shirt. Then, the shirts are put to the hilarity test, and people decide which one will win.Honestly, this collection is the best so far. All the games are awesome and will go GREAT with your Halloween and Thanksgiving parties."

The drawing your own tshirt game guarantees a million laughs - funny to see what your friends will come up with. I love quiplash, getting to vote on your friends answers is a lot of fun. And Murder trivia party is awesome too.   I've been a fan since ""you dont know jack"". This is a brand that is constantly reinventing itself with each release of Jack Party Pack. Whenever I have friends over, we pull out this game. I love that you dont need to buy ten playstation controllers for everyone to play because that would be too expensive. everyone is able to punch in their answers with their phone. cant say enough good things about this game.Sidenote: what this game really needs to take it to the next level is a way for people in all different locations to log onto their computer, go to one dedicated website, (or mobile app) and have anyone play together remotely. (because right now if you just go to jackbox.tv, that will only give you access to the 'controller' for answering questions. going to that website wont let you visualize/see/stream the game). It would be nice if JackBox offered streaming of their game through logging into their website. Because when I had people over at my house last night to play, we were on the east coast and we wanted some of our west coast friends to be able to play with us, and we werent very excited about the idea of streaming this on twitch mainly because of the twenty second lag. We ended up doing a skype videochat and I did a screen share on the computer so everyone could see the game that way. Setting that up was kind of a pain, because I'm not use to using Skype (and its also kind of annoying that the people who played with us who werent here in person needed an ipad or computer for instance to watch the stream of the video, and then a SECOND device to plug in your answers). It would be nice if you only needed 1 device."

,Recommended,434170,35281366,Posted: 28 September,all,Deika,"Since there are 5 party games in one game I'm going to be reviewing them all and thankfully for me, I have tried out all the games whether that be sacrificing my friends' time to play some of these games or playing it with my family members.Let's first start off with Quiplash 2: Whether it be family members, college mates or steam users this game is crowned as the best thing in existence.  This just like the first predecessor is really fun and enjoyable, there are lot of new things that haven't been introduced in the first game, such as the fact that you can create your own prompts, I have so far 2 episodes I made with a lot of crazy prompts such as ""help!  A gargoyle stole my cheese pizza"".  There's also new weird characters that you randomly play as such as a weird turqoise cat or a gray vampire coffin or a yellow (demonic voiced?) star.  They also changed The Last Lash level, instead of getting a prompt you're given either an acro prompt, a comic prompt or a word prompt and not only that players award the answers in medals so that is something new.Up next is Trivia Murder Party: This game is one of those trivia fact game host show things that would see on your television.  Only Trivia Murder Party takes place in a saw themed place where players play as plushies to try and escape, everyone gets a multiple choice trivia to answer, if one or more plushies doesn't the answer correct they would have to survive ""The Killing Floor (not the game Killing Floor) where in The Killing Floor, players/player have to play mini games of death whether it would be answering as much easy math problems as you can or spinning the loser wheel or remembering patterns.Next up is Tee KO: Tee KO is similiar to Quiplash but only instead of filling out prompts you are drawing t-shirts and filling out slogans for these shirts.  Once you've done that, other people are going to use your as well as some other players artworks and slogans to make their T-Shirt.  Once they've done that then it's voting time to see what T-Shirt is better than the other one.  This game is pretty complicated in my opinion, a lot of people I showed this one were pretty confused by it.Next it is Guesspionage: Guesspionage is a game that is all about percentages, how high or low it is.  One player is given a question and has to estimate what percentage he or she thinks is appropriate for that question.  Once they've done that, other players in the game are given two options of whether the percentage should be higher or lower.  When they finish doing that the real percentage is given out to players to see if the player given the estimation was higher, lower or spot on.  It has some pretty interesting gameplay, I must say.Last but not least is Fakin' it: Fakin' it has a very 60's cartoon look, in this game players have to work together on finding the faker.  Players are given tasks on their phones, tablets or laptops while one player (which that player is the faker) gets a different one, it is up to the faker's job to try and blend with the crowd.  Some of these tasks are: pointing to one or another, making weird faces, holding up a number of fingers or raising your hand.  Once players are told to stop doing these tasks, they have to vote on who the faker really is.  This game is definitely NOT recommended to anyone who wants to play this game over online because of these tasks given on your phone.And now the final conclusion on these games:Quiplash 2 is great especially that they added the option of creating prompts, Trivia Murder Party is fun, Tee KO is pretty confusing at first but eventually you'll get used to it, Guesspionage is pretty good, Fakin it is alright but not terrible.Overall: buy Jackbox Party Pack 3, buy some beer, buy some friends and have a wicked party.Cheers"

We would play it more, but the game takes a while to open and is super laggy. I know a lot of that has to do with my computer, but a lot of that is TMP itself. It's the only game that seems to have this problem.I also wish we could shut off memory mini games (like the blood splatter and patterns) like we can the writing and drawing games. Nobody I play with find those mini games enjoyable and they ALWAYS come up when we play."

Well, that is since anyone with a smartphone or internet-connected devices can hop in and play along with these four brand new titles and one upgrade. Trivia Murder Party is answering questions and playing mini-games to stay alive. Tee K.O. has players drawing slogans and wacky pictures to make the ultimate t-shirt (which you can actually buy). Quiplash makes a return with loads of new content... plus more!This is a must purchase if you and friends enjoyed the original two Jackbox Party Packs!"

,Recommended,434170,35120173,Posted: 21 September,all,Black Bean Salsa,"I bought the first game on a Steam Sale, but loved it so much that I bought the second one at full price and bought this third one almost as soon as it released. Definitely worth it. If I had a nickel for every time I've packed my laptop to a house party JUST FOR THIS GAME, I'd have enough money to buy the trilogy. You just need your laptop and an internet connection to start it up. Listen, the game uses your phone as the controller, which means literally every single person you ask to play with you immediately have a frame of reference for how it works. That's priceless. No teaching controls, no explaining mechanics, just ""look at the TV, go to that site, enter the code."" I don't care if you have an Android, iPhone, or cheap knockoff iPad; if you have an internet browser, you can play this game. The games offer the prompt, then your phone's browser lets you submit your response. Super easy. I've seen socially reserved people suddenly become the funniest f***er at the party, not because they're social butterflies, but because they were witty with their lies on Fibbage.PLUS, the games are presented in such a way that it can behave like either Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity. It's good to play with kids, college students, or adults and still have a good time. The prompts are never inappropriate, but you're responses can definitely be. Players can adapt the game to suit your own friend bubble's sense of humor and it's brilliantly handled. There's also a secondary prize in most games (the best ones at least) based on who had the most liked responses, which people can pick after the answer has been revealed.This one comes with 5 games and all of the best ones have an 8 player cap. Each game takes about 10-15 minutes to play, but they have TONS of questions and prompts, so you'll almost never hit one you've seen before and it's pretty easy to corral people to try it out because of the play time. Each game has an announcer that briefly explains the game and the rules, while also presenting the prompts. They're sorta funny; they get some laughs for being super cheesy. You won't want to turn it off for being annoying, at least. They're a little self aware, honestly. Quiplash 2 and Trivia Murder Party are THE games you need, though.Quiplash X is the first game you're buying this for. At the start of the game, everyone gets two prompts that they have to make up a response for. Prompts could be like ""A sitcom where two pairs of twins marry each other"" or ""Titanic 2: _______"". The catch is that one other player has your same prompt, and everyone is going to vote on the best response of the two. You get points based on the number of votes you get. Sounds simple, but that's why it's so good. It's probably the most approachable Jackbox game.Trivia Murder Party is basically a trivia game, only you're trapped in a basement and the bad guy from SAW is going to take you out one on one based on who gets the answers wrong. It's pretty fun, has a lot of diversions, and promotes just the right level of competition. You really have to play it to get how it works, but I like it and I don't even usually like trivia games.Guesspionage is pretty funny. You basically guess at statistics and get points for how close you were. Prompts can be anything from ""Percentage of people who make their beds in a hotel room"" or ""Percentage of people who enjoy pickles."" It's pretty funny and a good conversation starter.Tee K.O. is like Pictionary, except you're prompts are for T-Shirt designs, every prompt is given to two random people, and everyone else votes on the best one. You make the drawing using your touchscreen and get points based on the number of votes you got. It's basically like a blend of Drawful and Quiplash. Pretty fun and rounds off the pack nicely.Fakin' It is basically a ""Who is the spy"" game. It's alright.You get a prompt and have to raise your hand if it's true. People can call you out if they think you're lying, so there's a good balance between telling the truth and lying just to avoid being called out.Seriously, though. Get this. It's a great game to break out at a party or just with a small group of friends and super easy to set up."

,Recommended,434170,26161039,"Posted: 22 October, 2016",all,BrawnyBlaze,"The Jackbox Party Packs are quite possibly my favourite party games I have played so far. The games are incredibly easy to pick up and play for a wide variety of people. Not all of them are gamers, but everybody I've played these packs with so far including myself has really gotten a lot out of the games included in each pack. The Jackbox Party Pack 3 is no different.TL;DR:The game is very fun, but reminds me more of the first pack where some of the games were far superior to the others. This meant you would only be playing around half of the pack, while the other games gathered dust. If you like the look of Trivia Murder House, Tee K.O and Quiplash 2 or want a very fun party game to play with a wide range of people, you should absolutely buy this pack. However I do not recommend buying it for only one of the games, especially if it is at full price or slightly discounted at the most. If you are new to the Jackbox Party Packs, I would also advise getting the second pack as it is still the best one so far in my opinion.Full Review:I decided to play this at a small party I hosted and it ended up becoming the main focus for the seven of us that were there. As this was the first time buying one of the packs at launch, I was a little nervous but it had turned out to be great! Trivia Murder Party in these first 4 and a half hours of playing the pack has ended up becoming the group's favourite game choice of all the packs to date, which is remarkable. It reminds me in some ways of You Don't Know Jack, except the sharp edges of that game have been ironed down incredibly hard to make this one as close as you can get to perfection.Tee K.O is absolutely hilarious. It is a hybrid of Quiplash and Drawful where the captions and drawings created by the other users are given to other players and they create a t-shirt out of it. This has even spawned many inside jokes amongst the group. My only issue with this game is the rounds where you are drawing and writing captions feels a little slow and is not always fun to play through. However, the chaos of battling t-shirt designs more than makes up for it.Quiplash 2 is just Quiplash, except it now has a lot more replayability due to being able to create custom episodes with user generated prompts. Jackbox have really gone all out on this sequel similar to how they have done with the standalone Drawful 2 by giving a lot more options compared to the first Quiplash. If you want to experiment with user-generated content, then by all means consider this game as a factor to your purchase. If you already own Quiplash as a standalone or from the second Jackbox Party Pack, then it may not be worth your time.The best way I can describe Guesspionage and Fakin' It is that they are the equivalent to Word Spud and Lie Swatter from the very first pack. Guesspionage has an interesting idea and will generate a few chuckles, but there really isn't a lot to get out of the mode with me and friends wanting to play another one of the games after trying it once and finishing a game. Fakin' It sounds great on paper, but is a lot worse in practice. This was mostly due to confusion when me and friends tried it, as the player who was meant to be the Faker had no idea because there was no text given to him at any point in the round. It is also the only game where you can only play with six players maximum, so keep that in mind when playing with more than six players at a party (As I do not have much time spent on these two games, I may change this section of the review after playing with more people).As this game is still fairly new, bugs are to be expected. I have encountered only a couple of these, but they were minor. An example of these graphical glitches would be the one such as below, however I expect they will be quickly fixed.http://steamcommunity.com/id/BrawnyBlaze/screenshot/472142411515301680Any other issues I have with this game are very personal and only affect me as a person who has bought all three of the party packs and the standalone Drawful 2, so they are not worth bringing up.Overall, I recommend this game if you have played the Jackbox Party Packs before but I would recommend playing one of the other ones before the third pack. My favourite one so far is still the second pack and I highly suggest playing it first as all of the games are enjoyable to play:http://store.steampowered.com/app/397460/However this is up to you and if you like the look of Trivia Murder Party, Tee K.O and Quiplash 2, then this is a worthy investment. This game is best played with everybody in the same space playing the game. This is because in order to have other people see your screen while playing this game with your friends over the internet, you will need to use something such as a Steam broadcast which has a delay of 10-20 seconds. The game is also more fun when you are laughing in the same room together :3"

My one note would be that if you are playing with a decent sized group (I'd say more than 4 people), you are going to probably want to have a way to put the game onto a TV screen (with an HDMI cord, for example), because it is difficult to have just a laptop or computer be easily seen by that many people.

With the $30 price tag I expect to see a little more effort put into the number of word questions and trivia.Also it feels like the questions were chosen by a 14 year old who had been given a month to find minimum 50 questions, But instead left it for the night of and frantically scrolled through Wikipedia and thought of some off the top of his head, and I say ""his"" because not many girls care to know which Call of Duty came first."

The price is WAY too high for just something as basic as trivia and content that YOU have to come up with. I feel like it took them about a day to develope this entire pack of games. If the price was around $10, it would be a perfect buy and totally recomended but at the price now, it's not worth an hour of fun. Let me explain:So the tshirt design game is great but most people arent that creative so it becomes VERY stale after just one play through. The game where you try and figure out who is lying is just WAY too easy to figure it out because the questions they ask are way to specific and the faker always ends up answering something that makes absolutely no sense and BAM, you figure it out. The trivia game is okay but it;s a trivia game and that's all, nothing more so how much fun can it really be? So yeah, you see my point. It's an hour of fun for $25, and most of the games rely on every single person to be totally artistic, outgoing, etc and it just doesn't happen like that in real life. Don't waste your money on it until it gets way cheaper."

There is a lot of lag from jackbox.tv so you miss questions due to this as your pressed button often does not send data or have you to repeatedly hit the same button just to answer a question. Trying to answer the Memory Block game in Trivia Murder Party's kill room is impossible, the boxes you pick via smartphone never switch to the ON state without pressing them multiple times and even then you are lucky if you get a couple. I have Jackbox party pack 1, it does not suffer from this lag after you've joined the game.The initial jackbox.tv join game page where you enter your room and name seldom works on the first or even fourth try, pressing that PLAY button is painful.You will be frustrated playing this game just by the lagged out web interface on your smartphone.jackbox.tv will not work on Chrome browser and firefox draws a blank plage as well."

Everyone uses a smartphone or tablet as a controller, so it’s easy to get non-gamers to play! All games support 8 players, except for Fakin’ It which caps it at 6. However, anyone else in the room can join in by being part of the “audience”, who gets to participate in most games by voting for their favorite answers.Quiplash 2:This is one is 100% about being funny. No game has made me laugh more.Laughs: 10/10Competition: 8/10Fakin’ It:This is the most difficult to grasp in terms of rules. You actually have to point and raise hands and fingers IRL, not just using your phones. However, it’s incredibly clever and a blast to play once everyone catches on.Laughs: 6/10Competition: 9/10Guesspionage:For fans of Family Feud. You guess what percentage of people gave a specific answer in a survey. Then everyone else says if you were too high or too low. Fun game, but don’t expect frequent chuckles.Laughs: 2/10Competition: 7/10Trivia Murder Party:This is my all-around favorite. A hilarious, sadistic voice is holding you all hostage and killing you off one by one as you fail at trivia, drawing, dice rolls, anything. It’s like a really dark, actually-enjoyable Mario Party for 8 players.Laughs: 9/10Competition: 10/10Tee K.O.:This is the weak entry. Everyone draws random drawings and writes random phrases. There are no prompts, so this will test everyone’s improv abilities. Then other people make shirts by combining those. So Person A submits a shirt with Person B’s drawing and Person C’s subtitle. It’s an okay premise. But then you vote on which shirts are best. This is where the game really suffers. You can vote for your own shirt if you want (so you probably will). Two shirts go head-to-head and the loser is replaced with a “New Challenger”. This usually leads to the new shirts being picked each time because of the novelty factor. But there is no point system, and those who drew the winning shirt or wrote the winning quote don’t get credited, it’s just the person who slapped two of them together who wins. It was a pretty unfulfilling game.Laughs: 5/10Competition: 0/10TL;DR: Quiplash 2 is a must. Trivia Murder Party is an incredible Mario Party for Adults. Fakin’ It is complex, but worth it.

Quiplash can bring some pretty hilarious results due to players' responses and each game is unique due to each individual personality and thought process in providing answers. Trivia Murder Party is my favorite game of the lot and is well suited to a Halloween party; the trivia questions are hard and it's great to have a mode where even players who feel so far behind others in points can still comeback for a clutch win. Guesspionage is an interesting game where you will find out facts that you didn't know due to the fact that a percentage of people who do a specific activity will be higher, lower, significantly higher, significantly lower, or spot on to what you have guessed. Fakin' It is the more involved and active games where it requires you to hold ""poker"" faces and have timely reactions to ensure you are ""fakin"" it and blend seamlessly with the group. Tee K.O. lets you express your creative and artistic side by creating pictures and slogans that can go with a t-shirt; some player responses can make for some awesome and comedic results.

,Recommended,434170,30501582,Posted: 13 March,all,sn4k3rjaker,"Not every game in this box is an out-and-out winner, but as a whole this is a very strong offering as an easy-to-access party game. Because of this game I bring my laptop to almost every party/social event I participate in, and playing this usually winds up accounting for a huge amount of time investment.specific reviews of the games:Quiplash 2: Easy to pick up, deep, and incredibly fun to play. This is my bread and butter game from this box, and it doesn't get old after a lot of rounds played. My 11 year old cousin was able to keep pace with the rest of my family, but everyone (including one non-native english speaker) felt included and plugged in. 10/10Trivia Murder Party: The idea was great on this game, but every group I've played with has not latched on to it. My friends have tended to get frustrated by the difficulty of the game, and the announcer is very difficult to understand if there's ANY chatter in the room (which is a problem when he's explaining rules). It's a creative twist on standard trivia games, maybe a TMP2 will be better. 5/10Fakin' It: In a decent sized group that knows each other, this is the most fun game of the pack, but it falls short in smaller groups or groups that aren't tight-knit. The interaction outside of phones/internet devices is fun, and leads to a lot of further discussion. If it's not a tight group of friends, the difficulty of knowing/reading each other makes this much less enjoyable. 8/10Tee K.O.: By far the longest and most complex game in the box, but another winner once people are prepared. There's lots of setup before the humor pays off, and I've had a couple groups lose interest in that time, and once interest is lost it's tough to pull it back in. A patient group, however, can result in some seriously funny moments. 7/10Guesspionage: This really feels like a last second throw-in. It's a moderately unique idea that isn't complex or engaging enough to carry more than one round at a time. I guess they can't all be winners.Overall, I believe all the Jackbox Party Packs are worth having, but this is the one I pull out first. Quiplash 2, Tee KO, and Fakin' It are strong enough offerings that nearly any group I've played this with has been engaged in the game right up to the point that phones start dying.Overall: 8/10"

,Recommended,434170,29582816,Posted: 30 January,all,Willy Trombone,"Probably some of the most fun I've ever had communicating with other human beings.[WARNING, THESE VIDEOS CONTAIN PRETTY DAMN OFFENSIVE HUMOUR.]Stream Highlights Part 1Stream Highlights Part 2The Jackbox Party Pack 3 (and Drawful 2 to an extent) is what has given me and my friends hours and hours of fun, it's very easily a high recommendation from me.Quiplash 2 and Tee-KO are by far the games me and my group has played the most. It's easily the funniest and most amusing of all the games in this pack. Tee-KO can get a bit frustrating if people draw things that aren't meant to be funny, but it's not that big of a deal and is pretty much just a preference in my group of people. We choose to play both Quiplash 2 and Tee-KO with a laid back attitude, usually on the basis of trying to be the most overwhelmingly offensive we can. The two videos I linked are good examples of that.Guesspionage, while not quite funny, is definitely a worthwhile addition to the pack. It's results are sometimes surprising and the gameplay is satisfying overall. My main complaint (which is actually a REALLY big one) is that there aren't enough prompts in the game. In just two play sessions of the game lasting only about an hour in total, we had numerous repeated prompts, which could easily break the whole point of the game if enough of them appeared in a single session. Either way, it's good for a couple hours at least.Trivia Murder Party, while also not funny, is still quite fun to play. Unless you're the king of random trivia facts, it's mostly down to luck or instinct on who wins. The minigames in-between questions remind me a bit of Mario Party, except with a lot more murder to it. Overall definitely a good addition to the pack, further increasing it's value in my opinion.While I'd like to say that Fakin' It is good, I actually can't. Not because it isn't, but because we can't play it. A majority of my group that plays aren't anywhere near me, meaning the physical aspect of the game is nigh impossible. It can only really be played in person with those other people in the game, making it obviously much less fitting for a stream atmosphere.I'd say that Fakin' It is maybe a bit of a bold move by Jackbox, considering how much they embraced the streaming aspect of their games in recent years. While Fakin' It could probably be played somehow over a stream by jumping through hoops, it seems like a bit of an oversight.So, I don't really consider Fakin' It of any worth in this pack. It just takes up another space that could have been occupied by another game we could have actually played. If you have people next to you who can play, then it'll be of worth to you, but to streamers and/or people who play online, this one is basically a wiff.Overall I'd say that the pack is definitely worth buying, even if you're a streamer. 4/5 of the games are very suited to streaming and are easily playable by both your friends and audience alike. There are many streamers who stream the game regularily, one being me. (So feel free to drop in whenever you like.)Either way, fantastic fun for the whole family. Sometimes."

,Recommended,434170,28764216,"Posted: 28 December, 2016",all,NinMaster712,"Blah blah blah, you all know the drill.QUIPLASH 2: I LOVED Quiplash XL, and I love this game just as much. The new Quipsters are the best, especially Teal, the new prompts are hilarious, and the Last Lash... Oh my GOD, the Last Lash. They changed it so that, instead of generating a random prompt, they bring up a word for you to put into a situation (Word Lash!), an acronym that needs an extended version (Acro Lash!), or a one-panel comic that needs to be completed (Comic Lash!). I really enjoy the changes made, and I believe that this is one of the two selling points of this package. (Also the ""Make Your Own Prompt"" feature seems awesome, but I haven't tried it yet.)TRIVIA MURDER PARTY: Everyone's favorite. It's not mine, Quiplash 2 is, but this definitely gets the silver medal. The whole concept of a murderer hosting a trivia party and killing all but one player just makes me smile. The questions are good, the Killing Floor segments are cool (except for the freaking fingers one, GOD), the demented music is a nice touch, and the whole voodoo doll representation is amazing. By the way, does anyone else think the red one is flipping people off instead of whatever it is he is ACTUALLY doing? Anyway, this is a clever trivia game that should NOT go unnoticed.GUESSPIONAGE: I'll admit it... I don't like this one. When I first experienced a little bit of it, it seemed interesting, a percentage-guessing game with cool player avatars, but I later found out that not only does it seem like it takes forever, the concept got grating REALLY FAST. All of the questions are bizarre and I had a flat 0 for the entire first half of the only full game I played. If you like statistics, I would recommend this game, but it's probably even too boring for those kinds of people.FAKIN' IT!: I originally disliked this game, but that's because the first time I played it, everyone had confusing names and was scattered across the room, so we had to end it early. Playing it twice more, though, made me grow to like this game. I like the stereotypical 60s commercial feel to the game's art style and the music is a nice touch, too. I also like how helpless the liar can be, like during Number Pressure, when I held up 2 fingers when the prompt was ""Number of social media apps"", so I felt really tense for GOOD REASON. My only recommendation is that you play with the maximum amount of players (6) for a challenge and, as the game suggests, sit in rows or a semi-circle around the screen. Otherwise, You Gotta Point and Face Value will be IMPOSSIBLE. Otherwise, great game!TEE K.O.: I really like the art style for this one, as well as the yokai characters from Japanese mythology (I'm a fan of Yo-Kai Watch, don't judge me). The concept is nice, too, Quiplash with t-shirts. However, the game takes FOREVER. Two or three rounds of Quiplash 2, depending on the number of players, can be completed in the same amount of time as one round of Tee K.O., or, at least, that's what it seems like. At least one or two plays should be guaranteed, but if you like quick games like me, then this probably isn't the one for you.To conclude, this wasn't better than the 2nd Pack, but half of the games ARE worth your time.GAMES RANKED FROM WORST TO BEST:GuesspionageTee K.O.Fakin' It!Trivia Murder PartyQuiplash 2"

One thing I didn’t understand until after I installed the game was that you use a website on any device to answer the questions or draw.
