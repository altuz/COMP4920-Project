76561198030080447,Recommended,434210,31299898,Posted: 22 April,all,PrinzEugen,"This is a very simple educational game, primarily aimed at young children. It treats the passing of the seasons, using simple clicking mechanics and a pleasant, narrative voice. There is only one, apparantly hand-drawn nature screen, which changes colours when entering a new season. Leaves grown and fall, snow covers the ground and melts again. The colours are so beautiful and vibrant that adults too can enjoy the visuals - the narrative by itself is less interesting except for the very young ones, I presume.There is an auto-play function which I suppose is ideal for very young children, but those who already know how to use a mouse will certainly want to try the game out by themselves. Playing through the game twice took me only fifteen minutes or so, but I found it very enjoyable nonetheless and the easy Steam achievements added a perfect game to my statistics without any effort whatsoever. A small gem of an educational game, simple but perfect."

,Recommended,434210,35173292,Posted: 24 September,all,JacquesLeSauve,"WARNING: READER DISCRETION ADVISED!The following review contains words such as cute, endearing and charming in gratuitous proportionsShould you experience symptoms of curmudgeoning or cantankerousness, please consult a physicianBased on a puppetry play, It's Spring Again is a form of interactive education designed to teach young children the cycle of the seasons. A smiley landscape adorned with equally smiley trees and clouds and weird creatures representing the seasons, will act out the passage of time to show the order and effect of spring, summer, autumn and winter in a thoroughly charming manner.Interaction is fairly minimal and kept to clicks on the changing elements of the scene, or the occasional dragging of an obscuring cloud, while the whole process is narrated in a warm, endearing fashion. Though if this is a little advanced for some children, there's also an autoplay option, essentially turning it into a short animation instead.The whole thing can be experienced in about ten minutes, and while I'm sure an argument can be made about the merits of it needing to be a game or even having a price tag on it rather than merely being a YouTube video or something, I can't help but be enamoured by how cute and adorable the whole thing is and forgive it any such issues.For its intended ""2 and up"" audience, I think this is joyous enough to earn its recommendation... maybe even for a few people stretching the ""and up"" part of that suggestion, like myself. Though, all that said, if you're from the southern hemisphere then all of this is just a massive middle finger to you and nothing but horrible northern propagandist lies and should be boycotted vehemently... So there's that, too, I guess."

The Collector Edition, which is a must-have, has the video subtitled in English of it and pictures, concept arts, etc..The game is in Russian and in English, which means that kids from another language could be missing the educational side of It's Spring Again.The storyteller is explaining what you can expect from a season: flowers during springs, fruits in summer, mushrooms in fall, snow in winter, etc.. Each scene is interactive: for example, the child has to find the sun behind the clouds or to make flowers growing on the ground by clicking on it, etc.. First, no help is activated, unless you click on help on the pause screen. Then, an hand will show you where to click. And as the winter is technically ending the story, there is in reality no end of the game. Indeed, you come back to spring and the cycle will continue, showing that it's infinite. The title takes all its sense: it's spring again!The graphics are making me things of embroidery or anything that seems like it. Everything is anyway having eyes (trees, earth, sun, clouds). Also, the seasons are represented by a strange creature that is moving around. The voice acting in English is good and the sounds made when interacting will please children.It's Spring Again is a short and good little game for 2-3 years old, with interesting bonus if you buy the CE. Even if it's in English, I do think that the pictures in the CE can be interesting to use in a classroom."

,Not Recommended,434210,24607754,"Posted: 29 July, 2016",all,Marlock,"Its an illustrated book for children turned into an audio book paired with digital art and a little bit of interaction.Its for *very* young children, so its very short, simple and repetitive (it takes like only 5 min to loop back to the start), but that is expected because it's trying to teach about how the 4 seasons happen in sequence looping back to the start infinitely.I got this ""game"" (almost can't call it that) knowing exactly what it was meant to be. I've collected several books for children at home and all of these things didn't bother me in the least, they really have their own charm.Yet, it still was somewhat of a deception because:1) There is not that much interaction and its not very responsive at that. Ok, its for children small enough that they might be clicking at random, but then the narrow clickable areas at some points of the ""game"" are not such a good idea. It probably works better on a device with a touch screen, especially a tablet with a big screen.2) The illustrations are beautiful but not stunning and I'm under the impression that the original image resolution is less than FullHD and it gets a little scaled up. By the tags and some other reviews I was expecting ""The Secret of Kells"" quality and it just didn't get there (ok, I raised a high bar for it, but this is meant to be its best selling point).3) I'm a biologist from a tropical country and I love environmental education... what can I say about the 4 seasons being taught to children like this... it just doesn't apply to half of the world the same way and it just doesn't speak to my heart having grown in a very different environment. Would not reccomend for people in non-temperate climate because it can end up uneducational (not true to their reality).It certainly is ok for its audience, but that would be very young children in temperate climates, and even then its not that great."

I also suspect it doesn't go into more detail than it does because of how young its target audience is, and because it might derail the point of the ""story.""I'm a little curious why this game has achievements.  Would a target audience so young they'd benefit from something like this have an understanding of, much less a desire for them?  Maybe they're for the adults.  I can kind of understand the badges because of the game's art style.A valid point was made in at least one of the other reviews that not all parts of the world have these seasons. The title of the game makes it clear what seasons it's about.  It would be cool, though, if there was something out there for the other seasons of the world."

My one year old liked it. I do believe the gameplay (just clicking and at one time click and drag) is good for new users. It’s like a good exercise for the kid to get used to a mouse.Now why this still gets a thumps down is its lack of actual education. Now this is meant for the very young so I’m not expecting chemistry lesson on how water becomes snow. I do however expect them to explain why it’s colder in the winter than in the summer. Why the leaves change colours (in a shallow manor, not on a molecular level obviously). This game is done in 5-7min and they don’t mention anything the kids can’t see with there own eyes. If they tripled the length and mentioned stuff like: “The sun is not up for as long in the winter, which is why it gets colder.” Then it would be a thumps up.This is a cute game, or film if you choose auto play, that 1-2 year olds might find fun.

(Their playtime is on a family controlled separate account).Only suggestion/ con is that the cursor should really be child friendly ie. Large, easy to find on the screen, and slow moving. In the absence of these settings I have set up a specific cursor profile for when the pc is used to play this game.Overall however a very sweet first game for little ones, well worth the low cost."

That being said, it's beautifully animated, with relaxing music and a calm narrating voice to enchance the experience for kids playing it. The creators did a good job visually and interactively showing kids what happens during the seasons and how they change."
