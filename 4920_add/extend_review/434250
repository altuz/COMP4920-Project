Calling you a noob and saying you should die, Then you leave with a frustrated look on yourself that you want to rip your hair out. Great game amirite?Except.. Why is the prize $3.29? (I got this game since it was on sale $0.65)But why would you get a game like this and sell it for a price like that? I know it's cheap price. But for a game like this, It's not even worth having this over $1.00Pros:- Eh... just like my other reviews. It's one of these kind of games that you can litteratly kill time by playing games like these- For once it dosent have an ironsight as an option. I'm legit surprised about that. (Actually never mind you can, you have to stand still for it or move sideways, moving forward and aiming down sight cant work. Bad desgin much?)Cons:- Why do most guns look really poorly made and are overpowered as♥♥♥♥♥♥ I don't understand with games like this.- The game gives me FPS drops for no reason, For a game that looks like it was made in 2002. It has some poor optimization.- Yes, there are alot of empty servers, And mostly it's caused there's hackers out there that do it to ruin your fun.- Again, This game looks like it came from a Facebook game you see on Game sections that are waiting to be played, Maybe even on the Unity 3D Games you can easily find on Google, So I don't know why this has to be a thing on Steam.- The game randomly crashes, so it's hard for me to enjoy myself with the game without it crashing randomly.Overall: This game is ok. Just. ok. It's not something I wouldn't even bother gifting my friends to. It's full of cancer and why would anyone dare to buy and play this? But I guess if you wanna waste a few dollars (For a price of $3.29 That's stupid). Then go ahead. I'm not stopping you. Best buy it now when it's on sale.You're also better off to buy this than the 1st, The 1st one is just AS badALSO MAKE THE GAME FREE TO PLAY, NO POINT IN HAVING THAT PRICE OVER $1.00"
,Not Recommended,434250,29113655,Posted: 8 January,all,Beau Voss,"Okay so I got a coupon after crafting a badge for this, it only cost me 10 cents.I mean, I'm not gonna lie, I didn't find myself hating this game when I played it, I had some fun with it. If only from the hilarious ways people can glitch out when they die.This game is cheap, which is nice, the developer clearly knows this game isn't the new CoD, and it's priced for what you get. What's that thing everyone is saying? $1 per hour of gameplay?Well that's pretty accurate, I couldn't really push myself to put in more than two hours. It's really just not interesting or engaging enough. But hey, you get your money's worth, right?I will say though what I do like about this game is it has offline mode, WITH BOTS?!So many fps's nowadays I feel are lacking this, by no means is this a saving grace, it was a nice little surprise, and it did add some fun gameplay.Honestly though I can't recommend you buy this game, there's not much too it, the online is pretty abysmal, almost no one is ever on and it's just not fun. 3 bland levels, with two of them looking nearly identical, poor sound quality, bad AI, no options for changing difficulty or whatnot, glitchy, the only + to this game is the bots, to be honest, even if they are idiots.That's Masked Shooters 2, it's not great, but it's here, if you want. It is what it is."

,Not Recommended,434250,34340232,Posted: 18 August,all,Zarek,"Masked Shooters 2 reminds me quite a bit of something from 2004-2006. It's a great thought with old graphics, old gameplay style, and less options than the advanced games. For some reason, though, it entices players to continue playing despite all the flaws I mentioned previously.Masked Shooters 2 starts out with an older-style menu which lets you choose whether you want to play in Multiplayer, SIngleplayer, and there's an options tab for when you need to change things. The background is decent, however something a bit more interesting such as a tour of one of the maps, at least something that moves, might be a nice visual for the first thing players see when they purchase the game. As soon as you click an option, you have the ability to set up the map, the amount of bots you want to play with (this is assuming you clicked the singleplayer option), and whether you want a team battle, or a deathmatch type battle. You can then go right ahead and jump into the game after you pick your map (definite turn off for these kinds of games is the lack of maps. There are only 3 maps to choose from and no way to add/create your own.)There are a few different guns, and I'll list them:- MP5AK, Desert Eagle, M67 Grenade, M79 Grenade Launcher, M87T Shotgun, Knife, RPG, R93 Sniper, STW-25 Auto SniperFor a game like this, I guess it's okay to be able to access all of the weapons by scrolling your mouse or pressing a button. However, the main issue I see is that pretty much everyone and anyone can and will use the rocket launcher to just destroy everybody, which makes it difficult to snipe or use the pistols. It would be a lot better if it had a tiered weapon system where players start with a knife and have to work their way up to get the RPG and better guns. Just as one gamemode though, as a lot of people probably enjoy using their RPG to massacre everyone.One more thing that I must add, the bots are absolutely stupid. They won't detect me if I'm right behind them, and miss a shot. They have the tracking-type AI which will stop them from spotting me until they get their kill, or I kill them from behind. It makes it quite easy to get a lot of kills, as well as a lot of achievements easily. Achievement hunters, go ham on this game if you want the easiest 100% completion you can get.I enjoy this game. Sometimes, it's nice to reminisce a bit in some classic games. That's why I have 2 arcade-type games in my purchased list that I play quite often. However, this game really isn't worth the cost that it has attached, unless you get a discount coupon. The only reason I bought Masked Shooters 2 was because of the 90% coupon I got from making a badge. Verdict is not recommended, unless you happen to stumble across a coupon that makes it cheaper. Might be worth the price for 2-3 hours of fun before you never play it again."

76561198357938880,Recommended,434250,35094284,Posted: 20 September,all,Inside Line Racing,"Inovation. Precision. Gorgeous. These are all of the words that came to mind upon loading up this masterpiece for the very first time. I got into a match right away, eager to try one of the hottest FPS titles of 2017, my hands trembling with excitement. As the screen faded in the first thing I saw was a fellow competitor spamming racial slurs in the chat box. ""Now, I don't agree with such language but it is commendable of the developers to allow free speech in such a censorship heavy world."", I said to myself. Now, I'm primarely a controller user, and when I plugged in my Xbox 1 gamepad, I was greeted with one of the most groundbreaking control schemes I have ever had the pleasure of using. While ""A"" would typically make your avatar jump in traditional shooters, in this game it swaps weapons.""What's so special about that?"", you may ask. Well, dear reader, the genius of this shines only when you discover that the ""Y"" button also switches weapons! No longer are we oppressed by companies like Activision and Dice, telling use we can only have one weapon swapping button! If i want to press ""Y"", I do! If I want to press ""A"", I do! I must stress, my friends, that it only gets better. Most FPS games use the left trigger to aim, and the right trigger to fire your weapon. That is the pinacle of inconvenience. Why must I exaust myself pressing a trigger all the way down over and over? Well, thanks to Masked Shooters 2, this is a problem of the past. You see, you actually use the left bumper to aim, and the right bumper to shoot! Perfect for rapid firing the amazing 1 hit KO AR's and SMG's available to you from the very beggining. ""So then, what do the triggers do then?"", you ask once again, ignorant to this game's unrivaled layout. The answer is simple, the left trigger makes your soldier look down, and the right trigger makes you look up! Who needs joysticks? Not this gamer, I can assure you of that. Enough of the button layout, if you aren't sold yet then just you wait. This is hands down, the single most graphically impressive title I have ever played. 4K? Child's play. This game is real life. When I first booted it up, it felt like I was ripped from my plane of existance and placed into the world of the game. No longer was I a gamer in a wheelchair; I was a soldier. Ripping around the battlefield, quickscoping, no-scoping, 360 trickshots, I was doing it all. Never once did I realize I was in a game. The textures were so real, the audio so crisp. It may have been, in fact, too real. I lay awake most nights now. Flashbacks to the atrocities of war waking me up in terrified, cold sweats. Surley you must be thinking a game that looks that good would require a beastly PC, unafordable for most. I can, with upmost joy, deny this. How? It is the best optimized title in not only my steam library, but possibly on all of steam itself. My average FPS, on a foliage filled, expertly designed map with explosions and gunshots galore? Not 60. Not 144. 800. You read that right. 800FPS, sometimes peaking at over 1,000FPS. No other game will ever compare for the rest of my time on earth. I gathered up all of my favorite shooting games, MW3, BO2, battlefield 3, CSGO, games that were at one point my entire life; And I threw them into a fire. I do not need them any longer, for I am a proud owner of Masked Shooters 2."

Achievements are quite easy to achieve so it's and easy add for hunters. Worth full price (only 1 eur). Totally recommended.
