,Not Recommended,434260,21234946,"Posted: 15 February, 2016",all,Protoss,"What is ""My Name is Mayo""?No long review here, it is just a clicker game in the purest sense. You click through various story branches where each next option requires you to click x more times after selecting the current achievement from the pause menu. While the story itself is interesting, it is not deep at all. The whole game is more a joke game, an anti-clicker game that is not as bad as the one in the Basement Collection,[1] but dull enough in gameplay terms that you need to reflect on your gaming habits. Do you play games for achievements? Great, grab this, click 10k times and have another 100 percent in under an hour! Do you play for fun? Then avoid this! Or if you really play it, take the lesson you get from it, which is how stupid clicker games really are, why they only work as idle games, and even then only as glorified Skinner boxes.Graphics:The graphics are like a flash game. There is not a wide variety, but the different mayo jar styles are humorously done.Sound:The sound consists of a forgettable track and minimalistic sound effects.Gameplay:Clicker. Without any gains from idling. 10k clicks (pause menu to choose storyline excluded) and you are done.Recommended?No, I can not recommend this at 59 cent, or the standard price of 99 cent. This is made to be a joke gift to your friends, but buying for yourself would be silly unless you go for achievements. But even then, you could have gotten games that are more fun and longer in the last sale.[1]http://edmundmcmillen.blogspot.de/2009/02/avgm-retrospective.html- Thanks to freezing_rain for posting the link in his reviewhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/freezing_rain/recommended/434260/"

His game was called ""AVGM"" which stands for ""Abusive Video Game Manipulation"". It's even available as part of the ""Basement Collection"" here on Steam (it's a hidden game in there).As it stands AVGM had an interesting message, which you can read on McMillen's Blog here:http://edmundmcmillen.blogspot.de/2009/02/avgm-retrospective.htmlSo this game about the Mayo Jar here is basically exactly the same, but it's not a free game with a message like the one from Mr McMillen was... take from that what you want...Well, at least you can quickly farm 100% achievements here... but that's about it.Not recommended."

The jar of mayonnaise does play at ""dress up"" along the way, just to be silly.

I will try to write this review as serious as possible, though... come on. This is meant to be a joke. (I hope!)The Pros:It's a teeny bit fun- And by that I mean, it's so bad it's good. You get a chuckle during your first (an hopefully only playthrough)Great Gag Gift- When this goes on sale, it's half a buck. Not even a real jar of mayo can't beat that price. Send them to your friends before you give them the actual gift.Easy Achievements- Half an hour of clicking (I suggest making a click macro if you can, so as not to wear your mouse for no reason) and you get 50 easy achievements along with a perfect game!Trading Cards- At this point, every stupid game on Steam has these. Let them idle so you can at least return your investment a bit.Leaderboards?!- This actually has a Steam Leaderboard that ranks you based on how many times you've tapped the mayo jar. Some of these entries (although clearly illicit) show just what people can do out of boredom.The Cons:It costs money- While one buck is not going to break the bank, I can't think of any reason to spend it on this. There are loads other even stupider games that go for free. Unless you're in for the achievements and / or trading cards, go elsewhere.Could have been... longer?- Although I don't regret not being able to play this game more, it had the potential for the joke. Much more content could have been put in, even if it made it would make it in a cookie clicker clone.Conclusion:Seriously now, I love myself some occasional $h!ts and giggles, but at some point you have to draw the line between what should be somewhere on Newgrounds with a donate button, and an actual game for sale on Steam. There's nothing wrong with this game (apart from everything) but Steam just is not the place for it.If you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work,consider joining my groupandfollow my curatorpage!

Is this art or junk?It is unfair to regardMy Name is Mayolike a conventional game. Clearly it doesn't have gameplay as its main focus. It left me with a rather mixed feelings but having to choose, ultimately I'm leaning to the side of thumbs down.Presented with a huge jar of Mayo (tm), you proceed to poke at it with the equally huge finger-shaped cursor. Click click click, poke poke poke. Is this supposed to be a thing? Since it's mostly sold in plastic tubes around here I don't have experience with real-life mayo jars.There are no time limits nor arbitrary restrictions of other kinds: it's the epitome of casual.Achievement unlocked!It's basically an achievement dispenser. All cheevos have an in-game picture and associated text, which forms a short story or monologue, so they are integral to ""the story"". To see the whole story, highlighting the picture will add some detail into the mayo jar (like a bra or a simple curious animation) and story will proceed when you click it again a bunch.Graphics are okay, music makes you hum along even if it's terribly repetitive. However, this extremely casual entertainment lasts only as long as it takes for you to click about 10000 times, so likely just 30 to 60 minutes. Leaderboards for the highest clickers is basically a tongue-in-cheek joke.What's the point?So is it a good game? Definitely not. Is it fun or entertaining? Mildly. Is there a higher meaning to all of this? It is slightly thought-provoking to the point of being pointless. I am left with an irrational feeling of being mocked. Maybe that's the point. After all I just spent 45 minutes poking a mayonnaise jar.To the very least it is really cheap and basically feeds you 50 ""achievements"" that for once don't feel like achievements."

It was on sale so I checked it out and I thought...hmm this cannot be for real...?But oh it is, and I spent real money on this game. Money that I actually earned at a job. I would have been better off investing it. But I decided to throw it into the mayonnaise jar, and I don't even like mayonnaise.The whole point of this game is for the achievements. I'm an achievement ♥♥♥♥♥ so naturally I said hey now...But my main gripe with this game is that I am almost 100% certain that it was meant to be a mobile app game. Without a doubt. You play a finger that just taps on the glass of the jar, to navigate the menu you have to slide it down. I can honestly say within the first five minutes of purchasing this game, I regretted it.

All up, it takes 10,000 clicks to finish.The only reasons I could think of for playing this game are:1) You intend to write a review of it. (I can tick that box).2) You are really really really bored, with absolutely nothing else to do.3) You want to get some Steam cards; either to sell, or for a new badge.4) You are a ""stat wh*re"", wanting to raise your ""Avg.

If all that clicking is starting to kill your mouse, you can use the space button to double your output :)That being said, I bought it during the Summer sale when it cost less than a Euro. This price seems reasonable to me, even though there are many free games on the web that give you more fun for free.So what I'm trying to say is, if this game is ALMOST free than you should buy it. Just remember, this is more of a distraction than an experience."

What about dressed as a banana? If so, spend the dollar. You might get a few laughs. If not, don't bother.To unlock all the achievements, you'll have to click the mayo 10,000 times. Clicking progresses you through little storylines. Getting through all of these will take you roughly 4,000 clicks. After that it's 6,000 clicks with nothing new or entertaining (again, opinion, maybe you find poop rain really amusing and that will be enough for you). When that's done, you just let it idle for cards. That's all there is.I didn't find it fun or funny and, ultimately, it made me kind of sad."

The more you click the more you hear about random silly stories and they jar dresses up according to the part of each story you are cicking through. You pick a story as you unlock them and can read through according to color coded mini chapters concisting of a few sentances each. The more you click while dressing you jar within the lates chapter of a story, the closer you get to hearing the end of the silly short tail.

My Name is Mayo brings a revolutionary game to the table, a game that immerses the player into the life of your not so average mayo jar. My Name is Mayo tells a touching story, a story that rivals the epics of Homer, it is deep, emotional, heartwarming, and a puts a genuine smile on your face. Now the gameplay of My Name is Mayo is where this game shines. You see by either hitting the space bar or by clicking on the jar, you progress in the game. You see what is great about this is that the game has no time limit, or speed at which it must be played. You are in control, you drive the bus here, YOU the player get to expeience this adventure by your rules! Now if this isn't convincing enough for you did I mention that this game has a beautiful soundtrack? The music in this game surpasses any great symphony or musical piece ever written. It puts Motzart to shame, Bach can't even begin to comprehend how amazing this musical masterpiece is. Now if you aren't convinced of this game's amazing value by now then frankly you shouldn't even be allowed to use a computer anymore, because obviously you can't comprehend how amazing this game is, but if you still aren't convinced then let me tell you one last thing to change your mind. This game has achievements! Yes! Achievements! And these achievements not only make you feel really good, but you can show them off to your friends too! Trust me, Billy down the street won't be the cool kid anymore once you stroll in with your big list of achievements, not only that you can whip out that handy dandy smartphone or laptop of yours and show everybody that you're on the top of those world leaderboards for number of clicks. So you may ask, ""Wow this game is amazing, there's got to be some catch"" or ""There's got to be one bad thing about this game right?"" NOPE! My Name is Mayo is flawless, utter coding perfection. I mean come on, Fallout 4 on release had so many bugs the damn game was unplayable, but My Name is Mayo? Nope, no bugs here, 100% bug free since launch day. And the graphics? Well, My Name is Mayo takes complete advantage of your PC's advanced and powerful processors and video cards, it has zero restrictions whatsoever. No capping at 30fps to fit those console peasants, My Name is Mayo is 100% PC Master Race compatable. My Name is Mayo will change your life, are you single? Show a girl (or a boy) your high score and we'll see how ""single"" you are then. Failing math class at school? Play this and you'll learn advanced math with no problems. Are you overweight and want to drop a few pounds? Play this and your constant clicking will burn through that fat in no time. And best of all, you get this masterpice of a game for only $0.99! I'm telling you people, once we make contact with alien life, this is the game we'll show them to prove how advanced we are. NASA uses this game to help train their astronauts, seriously, it's that good! Tai Lopez himself uses this game, without this game he would have no knowledge, and with no knowledge there would be no garage, and with no garage there would be no fuel units, and then where would we be? My Name is Mayo GIVE YOU KNOWLEDGE. KNOWLEDGE.So what are you waiting for? Don't stare at your computer screen like a moron, Buy this game now!"

This empire seeks to bring mold to all foods in the kitchen. You play as Mayo, a strapping young condiment who doesnt realize he has the power of the fork. The Story of the game is good, (I dont want to give away to much), but the game really strides with its combat. A reverse third person system almost like CS GO but also nothing like it. I can see 2 more sequels in the future, then 3 horrid prequels, then in like 30 years I can see it being bought by a huge company known for kids stuff and 3 more sequels being squeezed out.

Green Lava Studios have promised so much with My Name is Mayo that it's hard to see how they could succeed, how they couldn't burn up in the harsh heat of audience expectation.My Name is Mayo takes place in a future you can see from here. The world of My Name is Mayo meets somewhere between Blade Runner and Robocop caught between the utopia of revolutionary scientific discovery and the dystopia of the people inevitably left behind.While My Name is Mayo can't be a revelation, it's an achievement nonetheless. It's a visionary, considered piece of work, and while my thoughts drift to the things that could have been and the compromises made due to the possibilities of video games in 2016, they're just as quick to consider playing through it again. My Name is Mayo is a smart and rewarding.At the end of the day, yeah I beat it in one sitting and in like 10 min but I will not ask valve to refund my money for this. there are hints of love and passion dashed all around this game and I respect it for that.9.5/10 wish there were actual♥♥♥♥♥♥in it."

Their hopes and dreams, struggles with family and intimacy and finding one's self. This game carries a strong message; we are who we make ourselves.Throughout the game you are rewarded, for the completion of mundane and banal tasks, brief glimpses into the main character's life. The games allows you to reflect upon yourself and attempts to guide you into the realization that it is only through experimentation and discovery that we can find our true selves.We know what the game sets out to accomplish; what does it make us feel? I found myself profoundly changed after experiencing this game. I laughed, shuddered, got excited, leapt off my seat, and even wept. I feel that in the aftermath of this true piece of art there will come about a social change.
