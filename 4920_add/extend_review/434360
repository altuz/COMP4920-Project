,Not Recommended,434360,32661991,Posted: 22 June,all,𝑺𝒂𝒗𝒊𝒕𝒂𝒓,I would recommend this but the developers haven't fixed a problem for me and others (that I you can fix like I did).It makes the game screen blury and also the developers have done nothing about it. I am giving this a thumbs down because they are not fixing a simple problem because they are to lazy to!

Basically, it's a game of ""run around as a cat destroying all the generic Unity3d resources"".  Fun for a couple minutes, max.  Mouse look might make it bearable, but as it is, virtually unplayable and not all that fun when played."

I had to take the advice from the reviewers. For anyone who still decide to take a chance and encounter the same problem, I recommend to ask for refund athelp.steampowered.com. Remember that you can ask for refund within 14 days of purchase if the game has been played for LESS than 2 hours!"

It's perfect for releasing the angry within yourself, from blowing Gorillas to men in black up, you just can't go wrong with this game, the only issues I have is that it not fully controller support yet."

76561198318172864,Recommended,434360,28411361,"Posted: 16 December, 2016",all,nightcatpurrs,"Kitten Rampage is highly addictive! You get to play as the world's most lethal kitten and vomit up grenades, shoot laser beams, drive, and cause unlimited destruction as you take on enemy agents. You also get to poop anywhere you like! I had a ton of fun doing the let's plat of the alpha and can't wait to see more added as time goes on. And the kitten handles decently once you get used to her (?), though driving controls could use some tweaking, overall, a really fun game.https://youtu.be/ND4jlrKGMsM"

,Not Recommended,434360,22419644,"Posted: 14 April, 2016",all,Fruitpunch,"This game is absolutleuy afwul. It copies the Goat Simulator format of broken physics, and whacky comedy. But instead of comedy that makes you laugh or confused, Kitten Rampage delivers 10 year old♥♥♥♥♥♥ poop, and middle finger jokes. Lets make a list of what I liked about this game>Pros:Kitten that shoots lasers and gattling gunsEasy to learn but I'll elaborate on that in the consGraphics pass pretty well for this kind of gameCons:This game is one of those early access games that is just absolutley broekn.The maps are way too big for this kind of game, having you search the entire area for Agents and Spiders.The physics in this game are what you'd expect but with the way the game is put together it doesn't flow.The controls keep you in a constant look forward state, no looking up or down.Driving a car is even worse as you have 0 control over it and always skid.The achievements are earnable in a short sitting leaving no challenge to the game.This is not worth your time, or money, do yourself a favor and buy ""Who's Your Daddy?"" or ""Goat Simulator"" You'll have a much better time"
