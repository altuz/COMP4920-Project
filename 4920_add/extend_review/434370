76561198140299850,Recommended,434370,21163299,"Posted: 12 February, 2016",all,foofaraw,"“Buried: An Interactive Story”, as an interactive story has a lot going for it. But as a story it still has a way to go, and some of the issues are so integral as to likely prohibit repair. Still, for the most part not a bad way to spend three hours. (Due to offline play, I can only estimate game time at over three hours. There is a LOT of text. I found this to be both a plus and a minus, as you will see.)The premise of “Buried: An Interactive Story” (BAIS) is that you are the boss of a logging crew who very suddenly finds that he and his crew are the victims of a mysterious and unknown disaster deep in the forest. You find your way into an underground government facility, where things really start to go bad. The story/game is broken into 5 chapters, each chapter is further broken into small segments, allowing for pauses.The story of BAIS is pretty basic Lovecraft-like, and not particularly original. Saying that, I would also say that the mood generated is adequately creepy, with a story that feels both complete and real, in the context of this type of game. If the idea was simply to create a great story, this would fail. But since the point is to create an interactive story, it succeeds quite well, with the storyline leading not to more story so much as more decisions. The purpose is simply to drive the player to the next choice, and the choices really stand out (at least for the first three chapters.) The choices really are often quite difficult to make, as they almost always involve other characters for which you feel a genuine sense of responsibility. Some choices are simply to move the story along, and give the feeling that the response would have varied little based on the decision made, if at all. Some choices are significant, as you are notified once your choice is final. At the close of each chapter the player is notified of the statistics involving each significant choice among existing players.UNFORTUNATELY, once the fourth of five chapters of BAIS is reached, the choices do next to nothing for the story and are rarely significant. In virtually every case it’s a simple choice of “noble choice” versus “selfish choice”, and shallow beyond belief considering the depth of many choices offered in the first three chapters. I chose “noble” (this IS fiction), so I have no knowledge of how other choices would have played out. About his point, the complexity of the game that was such a strong feature to begin…..comes crashing down. In numerous cases the story feels unconnected, and one death as related in the story was absolutely NOT the death that had occurred in “my” story. While there were many pluses to the first half of the story, I was quite happy when it finally came to a grinding halt.Great attention was paid to the grammar in BAIS, which was much appreciated. I only found one case of a typo, one of a sentence that made little sense linguistically, and one case of “I” instead of “me”. While there were numerous cases of commas improperly used (or absent), they were by no means dealbreakers. The minor background sounds added much, as did the background stills and the choice of typeface. The feature of leaving the game with a simple ESC, then returning regardless of the position within a chapter segment was very welcome.While I wish BAIS had either been shorter and cheaper, or long with more attention paid, it was still acceptable. Still, I would recommend waiting for a sale price of no more than $1.50 US.BUY ON SALE ONLY.Thank you."
76561198081356015,Recommended,434370,20761318,"Posted: 25 January, 2016",all,MosesvsJesus,"This game is exactly what it is advertised as. It is not really a game, in the traditional sense, but an interactive story. Do not go into this expecting traditional gameplay found in most titles as you're bound to be really, really annoyed. It's not even like a point and click adventure. You have no control over your character's movement, just some decisions that he makes throughout the 2-3h story.Without ruining too much of the story, this is a sci-fi text-based adventure that takes place in the woods of Kentucky. The story is narrated on screen via text, an eerie/haunting soundtrack and evocative imagery. I highly recommend that you play this game in the dark, both literally and figuratively. Knowing anything about the story in any form would ruin the thrill completely, and for this purpose I'm not going to go into detail here.The bottom line is - don't go into this expecting more than what you see in the title. It is just that - and it does what it does remarkably well."
,Recommended,434370,29451327,Posted: 23 January,all,Zed Clampet,"So, I was fascinated by this imperfect story and found myself really wanting to keep moving forward to see what happened. Sure, it's not a Hugo Award winner, but I'm not so cynical that I didn't enjoy it. It was a lot of fun.However: The vast majority of choices don't seem to really have any serious consequences. I've gone back and replayed it twice, and, with a couple of exceptions, you end up in the same place no matter what you have chosen. However, there are a couple of life-and-death decisions and a decision or two that make other characters irritable for awhile.Overall, I would have liked the game a bit more if there had been more serious consequences to the decisions made and more endings than just the 2 to 4 (depending on how you look at it). Most decisions don't really do anything and some of the decisions that the game claims are important are only acknowledged with a sentence or two later. It's almost as though the writer had intended a larger work, but then condensed everything down to where there were really no wrong turns.Still, I enjoyed the game and the story, and I even bought a copy for my little boy to play on his account. He was convinced even the most minor decisions were monumental and really enjoyed the game as well.Thumbs up for me."

76561198048974498,Recommended,434370,23286724,"Posted: 30 May, 2016",all,rjmacready,"Simply put, this is a solid and reasonably intriguing horror-mystery story told in the form of an interactive novel. The visuals are minimal but effective, the sound is spooky and immersive, and the writing is simplistic and a tad underwhelming but gets the job done. No great shakes, and fairly short (a few hours, tops), but worth the three bucks if you're up for a moody and sometimes action-packed tale with a wee bit of interactivity. It won't be an earth-shattering experience for anyone who's read the odd horror/sci-fi short story - or played a certain famous video game franchise, which I won't mention the name of for spoiler reasons! - but it's an entertaining enough diversion for those of us with an unquenchable taste for the eerie and enigmatic.Oh, and for those greatly concerned with such things: it would also appear to have some small degree of replayability due to the variety of choices on offer, even if one suspects that most if not all of the story's main mysteries are revealed in a single playthrough. But hey, what do you expect for three bucks? A blow-job AND a marriage contract?! C'mon, let's be realistic here...Verdict: 7.5/10."

76561198040035930,Recommended,434370,29696532,Posted: 4 February,all,Hoochfox,"Straight off, let's do away with the ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" tag.  It'snota CYOA, as the plot doesn't appear to truly diverge except at the very end; it's just aesthetic choices which are quickly railroaded back onto the same author-set track.  That's okay, though it harshly limits replayability.  With this in mind, if Markiplier brought you here,stop watching his playthrough until you've finished the game yourself.The speed of the text and button reveals feel appropriate to the atmosphere, but it's painfully slow when you're just trying to power through a replay.  Although mashing the space key can speed this up a bit, I think this game would benefit from a variable speed/instant reveal option.An appropriate atmospheric soundtrack is a pivotal 'make or break' point in multimedia literature, and Buried makes it.  The Wasteland/Fallout feel of it fits well.  Markiplier claims at a few points in his playthrough that the 'calm' soundtrack doesn't fit the immediate events.  I disagree; this is a text story, and jumping to frenetic music would be distracting and would stand out like a sore thumb.  This soundtrack doesn't stand out – it looms in the background.The writing is respectable.  I would caution author Barry Napier to ""kill his darlings,"" however; ""haul♥♥♥♥♥quot; is a phrase which should never be used more than once in a work, and then only to demonstrate what sort of person a character is.  Beyond that, there's some over-reliance on horror/action tropes, occasionally to a degree which borders on breaking suspension of disbelief (ie: Overdrawn at the Blood Bank, Ax-Crazy, Aliens are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, Science Is Bad).  Mostly, though, the writing is convincing and interesting.  I hope to see more interactive fiction like this from Mr. Napier and Bromoco Games.And then, there's the value.  That's not exactly a Triple-A price tag.  Overall I wouldn't call this a masterpiece, but it's well-made entertainment for substantially cheaper than watching whatever trash reboot Hollywood has most recently vomited at the cinema.  Save your money and get Buried instead."
,Recommended,434370,29393211,Posted: 21 January,all,Krushak,"I'm gonna be blunt here, this, game, is, freaking fantastic. I'm only in 3 chapters and I'm hooked. If you are looking for the old book reading ways of ""choose your adventure"" style books this is the style for you. I'm currently recording a let's play of it and will be up on youtube and I will provide a link below but for now, let's get into the depth of this.---Story So Far---Like I said I'm only 3 chapters in but it can only get better from here. I was instantly hooked into the story from the start, so far though it seems not much change has going on since I am watching anther YouTuber play it after the chapters I played and it seems we still got the same results just a bit different,  a different order  etc etc but that does not decline the value of this. Why? Because I could play it and someone could play it and they could be like, OMG DUDE DID YOU SEE THIS? And I'm like NO DUDE BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED! I do love the fact that at the end of each chapter it tells you how others reacted to the major decisions that you make in the story. It'll say you and 36% of players chose this.See my point? I won't spoil anything at all about this you'll have to pay the money for the game.---Music/Artwork---The music is a ten out of ten, sure it's very basic but the subtle of the music adds to the climate of the still shot art. The art that is in the background is fantastic.  Though I think they could have added more to the music at the starting of the chapter 1/2ish by acting a slight hum, ya know the hum of florscent(sp?) lights but it's not a deal breaker.---Price---For 2.99 this game is quite worth it so far, I hope to play it more after I beat it to see if there are any other endings/branching paths etc etc. I really hope the makers will make more of these. Perhaps expand the genre, expand on their game and make even more, bigger, more decisions/endings, etc etc.---If you wish to see what the game is about, here is a spoiler alert and a link to the playlist of what I am making for a Let's Play. I hope this convinces more people to play this game.https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrS81Xfbl5mtRJ5y9IJyw4onO94b-ZDF6Have a good night."

,Recommended,434370,32140810,Posted: 2 June,all,MalkavianChilde,"I found Buried to be a brief but enjoyable experience. The story reads from the perspective of a timber logger who has come to after an unexplained accident, then attempts to discover what happened and subsequently get to safety. The writing is very good and flows well; I was concerned for the characters and found them fairly fleshed-out despite the shortness of the game. The story has a strong supernatural element to it which allowed for an anything-could-happen feeling that kept it from being too predicatable, and it features realistic dialogue/action choices as well (hence the 'interactive' title.) I played without sound, so I can't comment on the quality of that.The pros: The well-written narrative and story arc kept me interested to the end, plus the text appears at a quicker speed than in many novel-type games which appeals to me as a fast reader. The background images are nothing special, but perfectly adequate, and always fit the current situation. The price is very fair for the quality of the experience and the playtime.The cons: While the game does feature ending variants dependant on your choices, they aren't different enough in my opinion to offer replay value. Because of how much I enjoyed the story, I would've liked to have needed more than two hours to complete, and while it all falls together well, I did wish there was more.Overall, I'd recommend the game to those who already enjoy an interactive visual novel experience, and to others who appreciate an intriguing supernatural tale. I would happily blind-purchase another story from this developer."
,Recommended,434370,29439171,Posted: 23 January,all,Tehzim,"Lovecraft written better.  It works in the fashion of the Choose Your Own Adventure books of my youth.  A story of a simple logger who awakes after an incident.  To tell more would be to spoil.  It takes about 2 hours or so depending on your reading speed.  The choices are generally the ""go left"" or ""go right"" and the story seems to follow a similar path more like branching paths that tie into the main narrative.If you love the works of Lovecraft at his most sci-fi then Buried is for you.  It's $5.  Buy it and play it.  I'm going to play again and see what the different results are.  So if you like story games this is a good time drinker."

The characters were well thought out, although towards the end some of them seemed to change rather drastically in a very short amount of time. I'm still curious about the other possibilities that you can get from this game, but I'm not sure I want to spend another 3.5 hours to play it all over again. I wish there was a feature where you could start from a specific chapter (which there may be, I haven't gone back to look yet) so I could just go to the parts where I made mistakes and correct them. The only other criticism I have about this game is that it is simply another game that more or less creates the illusion of choice. In some instances it doesn't really matter what you choose to do, the outcome will be the same, however, this game didn't do that badly when it came to meaningful choices, and I commend it for that. I approve."

No amazing 3D graphics, dazzling explosions or killer AI enemies... What is amazing is the terrific, immersive story you are drawn into.The tale begins with you waking up after some kind of accident in the woods. You try to find out what has happened and are gradually drawn into lethal mystery. All the elements are top-notch. Great characters. Creepy environments. Discoveries that are both baffling and horrific. And threats that are chilling and relentless.During the story, you regularly make decisons that will affect the narrative. You may find yourself crushed by a choice which leads to an awful death. I found there were sufficent decisions to be made to keep you deeply involved without detracting from the game's biggest strength, which is the storytelling.The writing is gripping from start to end. For me, it felt like being trapped in a truly sinister Stephen King story - it was that good.Negatives? Other than a few typos near the end of the story (which didn't spoil the game), none at all.Playtime: 3-4 hours.Overall: 10/10.

Let me explain.A friend of mine had exclaimed to me their excitement when they learned that a YouTuber they enjoyed had begun this game, interested in what they had told me about the game, I checked out the video in question they had mentioned.Immediately the game had me drawn in with it's amazing writing, compelling story and the on-going intense atmosphere. The pacing of the story is good, it never has a boring or drawn out section and the writing does wonders to keep a thick atmosphere throught it all.After seeing it through on YouTube, I feel I have a fair basis to judge this game on, as the experience is solely based on reading and the odd decision to make here and there as opposed to a game like (just for example) DOOM, where you would get much more out of it from actually playing it.To close, I will say this, although I experienced the game before buying it, the fact that as I mentoned above it was all so well compiled that I felt compelled to purchase this with no intent of going through it myself.

The game is just reading the text on the screen with a pretty screenshot in the background.  That is the dumbed down version of what you can expect.The game will play about 3 hours or more give or take depending soley on how fast you read and can make tough decisions.  Immedietly the game throws you into the action making you choose the fate and well being of those around you as well as yourself.  As of right now I have watched half of the game in a let's play by Markiplier(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZYwn4noWho)and have also finished my own playthrough.  The game is so immersive and tense that its like watching a movie that you at the same time are a part of.  You feel remorse for your actions and sympathy for characters you never see or hear and that is only a part of the beauty of this game. You have to try it for yourself and you will quickly find out if you like it or not defintely by the 2 hour steam refunding point. Goodluck!9/10 I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who is interested.  One of my very few problems with the game is the ending felt just a little bit rushed or like it could have been just a little more satisfying in multiple ways. I like what it tried to do but fell flat and felt more like a lazy cop-out than an ending worthy of the game up to that point."

When I got into the ""game"" I realized it was literally a book. So instead of judging a book by its cover, I began reading. The story became very interesting and I wanted to read more. The concept of the reader and the characters having vague clues on what is going on, just aroused my curiosity. After Chapter 1 I was so enthralled in the story and I couldn't stop reading. The story may only be 5 Chapters long and have a very weird ending, however, it's just incredible! I'm not saying the ending was terrible, the ending was actually quite of a cliffhanger but left on a good note and I genuinely liked it. It opened up the possibility that top secret agencies are actually researching these kinds of things and makes me wonder.

It is heavilly inspired by it and 1 thing that shows it is that at each chapter you get a little menu that shows how many % of what players made what choise.*random example* 36% of the players desided not to inspect ______ body.To give you a idea.Do i recomend it? Yes. Totally. If you like atmospheric games and reading. Totally go for it!1 thing i have to confess is that they made the mistake of not making it feel YOU are there, dont get me wrong but they let you play as a 41 year old guy that owns a wood chopping company, if they gave the idea that it was you standing there and you could fill in names of friends then it truly is a masterpiece.Maybe just me but non the less it's great. i love it so far"

So why do I give it a thumbs down? Lack of replay value.""But random steam reviewer,"" I hear you saying, ""How can a game with action/consequence and multiple endings possibly not have replay value?""I can't believe the answer I'm about to give for this: The story was written too well. Well, that and some of the morally ambiguous choices you're given have an obvious answer. Yeah, it may be wrong to kill this guy, and it may give away your location, but he's betrayed you twice already and will likely do it again if given the chance. Besides, if you don't, the bad guys will.  It's hard to imagine that scenario working out too many different ways.Anyway, what do I mean the story was written too well? I mean, for as concise as it is, it makes the other possibilities pretty easy to predict. Sometimes your character outright says exactly what will happen in both situations.""But what about going back to explore for more info on the world?"" you ask. Well, I have one thing to say to you: Go play Half-Life 1. Or don't, since it's a totally different kind of game even if the stories are basically identical. In all seriousness, if you ask all the questions on your first run, which I assumed you did since you care about understanding the world, there won't be anything new to find on the second run that you didn't already learn.I give it a 7/10, but the three strikes against it are enough to make me say, ""I wish I'd just watched a playthrough."""

The story was interesting, and while not incredibly deep, it was adequate.My biggest qualm is that regardless of what you choose to do, the greatest differences of the outcome are only made in the end of the game (which you can only get to by playing through the rest of the game first, as there is no saving) and thus the plot was extremely linear and reduced the replay value to once or twice at most, which is disappointing for a ""choose-your-own-adventure"" style story."

,Recommended,434370,31024753,Posted: 8 April,all,Potato,"Buried has some way to keep your attention for the whole story, doesn't even need graphics.The visuals for the game considering what it is are quite good, not in the sense of something that is 3d or even 2d, the backgrounds behind the text are really good to give you an idea of what the surroundings you are in.The gameplay is done very good, the text is easy to follow with, and the background noises really add a creepy feel to it. As far as the end game, it really only leads to two options to choose from, so the whole story never really changes. Regardless it is still fun to experience but doesn't have much replay value.The price is completely reasonable in my opinion as you are pretty much getting a mini story that you get to choose how they get to the end, so I believe its worth the cheap price.Overall, the visuals for the game are good for what it is, the gameplay technically doesn't change the outcome but still is good to play, and the price is good.Overall - 7/10"

Although two of us already knew the potential ending it was still fun to go through it again.

There are plenty of choices you have to make along the way, and at the end of each of the story's chapters they break down your decisions and show you how many other players forged a path similar to yours.  It was interesting to see if my decisions were the norm among those experiencing Buried or if I was taking the roads less travelled.If interactive stories are your cup of tea then I highly recommend it."

As he moves though an underground bunker whose entrance is exposed when Roger wakes up, he begins to realize that the incident was not just a simple vehicle accident, but something far more supernatural, and horrifying, then he could've ever imagined.The core gameplay of Buried is simple- text is read to you on your screen describing the story, and when you come to a fork in the road, you're givien two choices on what to say or do. Unlike Telltale games, these choices are not timed, allowing you to think each decision through. Unfortunaltly, very little of the choices in Buried really affect the plot long-term. Most of them are just simple dialogue options that only show how your Roger views the current situation. There were some choices that had potential to really affect characters, but they don't have any emotional effect on said characters for more than 30 seconds. You tell a character his best friend died, he takes in the news, mopes for a few seconds, and by the time the scene's over, both characters have forgotten about it and never bring it up again. The first 4 episodes really only have 1 or 2 major decisions throughout their 30-40 minute runtimes. It isn't until the final episode that the game really steps up and gives you some really big and impactful choices that really affect the plot.Storywise, Buried tells a pretty intresting story. The game does take the cliche ""government experiment gone horribly wrong""path for its main plot, but it explores a different side of this plot that isn't commonly seen. Instead of focusing on stopping the thing that went horribly wrong, this is a story about witnesses to the event, and about them trying to comprehend what in the hell just happened, and trying to hold on to any hope of survival, no matter what form. As Roger and the few survivors he finds make their way through the bunker, there was this big sense of unpredictability and unknown threat as you slowly begin to see what horrific things the creatures can do, and when you do reach the encounters with the creatures, they're so unpredictable that every encounter feels different, and it's really engaging to see Roger and crew desperately try to both comprehend these things, and fight them off at the same time. The encounters with the creatures are truly the highlight of each episode. Bromoco Games also nails the pacing of this series, smoothly weaving between character moments, plot revalations, and action sequences, all adding up to a well-paced adventure. And by the time you get to the final episode, well, let's just say the supernatural parts of the game completely take over, leading to some of the best moments in the game. While the soundtrack and visual pictures in the background aren't anything special, they're a good fit for the environments described, and really do add to the overall experienceFinal Verdict:Pros:-Powerful, character focused story-Soundtrack and visuals fit the mood nicely-Action-packed final episode-Great pacing throughout all five episodes-Unpredictability of the creatures make the encounters with them truly memorableCons:-Not many game changing choices-Painfully short runtime-Occasionally nonsensical character behavior-Little variety in endings leads to little to no replay valueDespite a shortage of impactful decisions, short runtime, and almost no replay value, Buried's powerful story and unpredictability, especially in its final episode, makes it really worth looking past it's issues.Score: 7.5"
