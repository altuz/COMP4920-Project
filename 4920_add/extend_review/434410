The choice of music fit very well with the game play.  The art was FANTASTIC...  Controls were super simple and easy to pick up, but MonkeyMaw went one step further and added the ability to customize ""remap"" controls...That was an excellent idea.  I highly highly recommend this game for all gamers becasue is a beautiful and thought out game.. I hope nothing but the best for MonkeyMaw and hope to see some more games in the future."

I saw it's a platform 2d sidescroller and I just had to buy and test it. It absolutely wasn't a bad choice!As mentioned the game is very short but it seems be a great beginning of long story-based game. Actually I had a bit more than an hour to complete it, but it was amazing to play it.The amazing atmosphere and the music round it off to a masterpiece of an indie game.The only negative point is that the story is very short but as said before the open end gives it a good opportunity to add more parts.I can definitely recommend this game to everyone who wants to get away two hours from racing or shooting games."

76561198030414441,Recommended,434410,28852898,"Posted: 30 December, 2016",all,Ralgaoud,"In Moonlight you play a creature fascinated with the moon and with the idea of travelling to it. A stranger to town, he needs to do the other furry NPCs favors to find someone to help him achieve his objective. The first NPC gives you a quest that rewards you with the NPC's own hat upon completion. This hat grants you instant rapport with the next NPC, as clearly if you deserved a hat, you deserve to be trusted. Thus ensues a short (less than an hour) 2D platfomer. There aren't any enemies, just a string of NPC to appease in a linear fashion. It is relaxed, has beautiful art/environment and *really* good music, there are several tracks which is surprising considering the length of the game, and they are all good.While I do recommend this as an easy inoffensive palate cleanser between games, it did leave me slightly unsatisfied. I couldn't shake the feeling that this is more of a prototype than a complete product. It felt like the developer created this setting, mood, good 2D platforming mechanics, and then cut the project short. It doesn't help that almost all the doors you run into in the game are locked, adding  to the feeling that there was something more there that was left incomplete. I would have liked if this had more content: more NPCs, a bigger town, more tasks, etc. Just to give the entire quest some weight.P.S.: Found it cute that the developer dedicated this game to his two daughters, I hope that one day I am able to dedicate something beautiful like this to my children :)"
76561197994686280,Recommended,434410,21069824,"Posted: 8 February, 2016",all,whatthetrash,"'Moonlight' is a peaceful, delightful game about helping one another (and playing with stylish hats ^_^). The tone, artwork and music are all lovely. While short (I beat it in 2 hours), it was a lovely experience.---- PROS ----- Great Artwork- Lovely UI, Menus (yes, I notice stuff like that)- Good dialogue with the characters- Characters that have a lot of charm and personality. I particularly liked the clear emotions of the characters at different parts of the story.- Beautiful calm, atmospheric music- Simple to understand gameplay (all you do is jump and talk to people...though it gets a *bit* more complicated than that) ~_^---- CONS ----- Short. While lovely, the game can be beaten in about two hours. Know that going in. :)- There were a few grammatical errors in the dialogue (I believe the dev said they're working on that, so that's good)- I didn't like how the game defaulted to using the directional pad for movement instead of the left analog stick.(I think both should work right away.) Regardless, in the settings I was able to change movement to left analog stick. I still had to use the 'X' button to talk to people instead of the 'A' button (which I prefer), but it wasn't a big deal. I got used to it pretty quickly.- This is sort of a nitpick with the trailer, not with the game itself. At over 4 minutes long, I think it shows too much. I mean, 'Moonlight' is not a long game, so as much of it should be preserved for the player to experience. I would think a minute long trailer - maybe a minute and a half showing a variety of gameplay (and nothing past the hot air balloon) - would be cool. Just a thought. ^_^---- TL; DR ----'Moonlight' is a calm, atmospheric platformer with a great look, soothing music and interesting characters. While short, it does what it does very well and I look forward to further work from the developer.---- FINAL GRADE ----8 out of 10"
,Recommended,434410,30399955,Posted: 8 March,all,Indurok,"Video Version of this review:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=879509466You play as a character named Kinubo. His biggest desire throughout the game is to go to the moon, and you have to find someone who’s willing to help you get there. But no one will talk to you, because apparently, the other Lumpos don’t like strangers. None of these guys are happy to see you… except for one, of course, because otherwise, there’d be no game.Then starts a chain of events, all of which involve taking a character’s hat in order to talk to other characters. But all of them want you to do favors for them… because video game logic. The tasks themselves are relatively simple. There’s one in particular that I like. Lanuno wants you to get her wand back from her brother Wizupo. But to get it, you have to do a bunch of gravity-inverting puzzles. They’re not really hard, but I did end up getting bounced around a bunch of times.This game is very calm and peaceful. There’s no violence, no enemies, no weapons, and no traps. The only way you can die is by falling out of the bottom of the screen. This game is also very pretty. I like the glow of the moon against the dark blue sky. It’s quite pleasant to look at. And the soundtrack is so relaxing.I find the controls a little bit strange. Usually, if “X” is to interact with stuff, then “Z” would be the button to jump rather than the spacebar. But whatever.There’s this one door in a cave that doesn’t take you anywhere. I know the sign next to it leaves a hint, but I can’t figure out how to make the door work, if it’s supposed to work at all.There’s also this one guy who has a flaming hat that he claims makes people hate you. But that guy wasn’t kidding. Seriously, if you wear his hat, not a single one other character likes you one bit. Not even the king will talk to me.The king is the last character you have to talk to, and he agrees to help you get to the moon. But you have to set sail for another island for someone else to help you. But this is where things get quite different than what you’d normally expect from a video game. But I don’t wanna spoil it. So I think now’s an appropriate time for me to end my review.So far, I have no complaints about this game. You should totally check it out. It may only be an hour and a half long, but it’s got an interesting ending, and it’s also a good game to play if you simply just want to relax."

I'm pretty much saying each quest felt like its own thing. Another good thing is that there aren't so many quests that they get way too boring, like in a lot of other games.The game does feel a bit short, but programming takes a lot of hard work!

I think one of the best aspects in the game lies in the plot where there is the twist when the developer is introduced as the master of the story by King Atulo. The other elements of the game that I liked were the puzzles where you had to search for different items like the nuts and the wand because of the varrying difficulties. I had an especially hard time in the caverns, but it wasn't something that deterred me enough from having fun.The only con that I found in the game was the dialogue, it felt a little forced and bland but when the plot twist that I talked about above was introduced, it got a lot better and I was immenseley intrigued.All in all, this is a very solid game for being someone's first game that they've put on steam. :)"
76561198044975832,Recommended,434410,22347113,"Posted: 10 April, 2016",all,coda57,"Early this week I was browsing the Steam Store for something new to pick up and try, upon further searching through the store I came across this game, Moonlight. Moonlight is a very short, yet rewarding game, or so it was to me. It's a story driven platformer with a few light puzzles implemented into it. Once I loaded the game in you are greeted by the calm atmospheric tones of this absolutely beautiful soundtrack that just fits the entire game perfectly. Which brings me to the art style of the game, the art style of the game for me on a personal level is just amazing. I'm a huge fan of 2D/Bit games like these, add a little platforming and I'm sold. But the art style in general is very calming, thought the entire game (except one area) you have the Moon looming over head, always in sight casting it's glow on the ""land"" you walk, the blue over tone fits it all to perfectly and just makes it a calming theme. During your adventure you meet several characters in the village, some you might like at first, others might have to grown on you, but none the less the very short few minutes to spend helping these characters leave a lasting effect in your heart. You really start to feel attached to them and really want to hang around them more, but you must move on in your adventure. I'd like to say as much as I can about the ending without spoiling anything, but to be honest I can't think of anything I could say that wouldn't spoiler it. You'll just have to play it yourself and find out. I paid $4.99 for this game, for what I played and the enjoyment I got from it, I'd pay $10 easy for this game. I strongly recommend picking up and trying Moonlight out for yourself, oh and explore as much as you can, there's little hidden things here and there.All in all, if I was a professional game reviewer I would give Moonlight a 10/10, to be honest I'm sitting here trying to think of some flaws this game has, sure there might be a few things that need fixing, but nothing game changing or anything that will change your experience.Thanks!"

So paying $5 for 1.5 hours of enjoyment isn't bad at all, especially when it's this cute.My only bit of critique, and this could just be personal tastes so it may not even be valid, is the conversations sometimes went on a little long and got to a point where they were sometimes a tiny bit awkward, but really that's the only thing that bugged me at all about this game, everything else was fantastic.If you want to see a bit of a preview before buying, you can check out my ""let's play"" series of this game, which I had a blast making.Also if you're an achievement go-er, this game has quite a few, pretty easy to get achievements, so there's that.Again, great game!"

,Recommended,434410,29577243,Posted: 29 January,all,V Δ P O R C Δ K E,One of my new favourite games honestly. VeryOri And The Blind Forestesque but in a shot simple and sweet pixelated form. Characters and story are adorable plus it has a great soundtrack to piece it all together. I would definatly put in a vote for a sequal game!
