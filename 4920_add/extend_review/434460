You can only play with one ball at a time though, so it's not enterily realistic. The MooMoo's made the experience a lot more down to earth, it also made me a little hungry.You can also play with your friends balls. Together you can form a ballsack, beacuse you will be two balls in harmony with each other. It's the very pinnacle of Cooperatiton.This game is clearly a 9/10 according to chat, not a hardon coolider but pretty damn close to it.Music was pretty gud, boss fights were pretty echh. They could have been more challenging. The♥♥♥♥♥Demon was pretty cool. I don't really know much about history or anything related to artsy fartsy facts.It sucks♥♥♥♥♥that you have to use a flag like Skåne/Denmark. Yellow Red with a cross?

It's also one you can play in short bursts if you can't commit to long multiplayer sessions."

Units are more diverse and not just basic upgrades of the same basic types. The nearly unusable castle catapult has been replaced with a farther reaching lightning bolt.So you can deploy hot air balloons dangling lions that grab and scratch enemy boulders, holding them in place while your cannons blow it apart, or use fans to blow the enemy boulder in to a springboard trap flinging them into range of your whale, that sucks them up and spits them out, and all the while they're being peppered by row of trebuchets, or deploy a few heards of trusty sticky cows near your castle gate, guaranteed to wreck havoc on the enemies momentum before they can batter down your gate. There's a lot of different strategies to make use of the unique options this game presents, and navigating them is just as much of a thrill as the devious glee of setting them up.buy this game"

This game improves on most everything from the first game.Graphics- are great.controls-you feel like a rolling rockgameplay- its a tower defense that you switch between attacking using a rock (or square) to damage the opposing sides gate. and birds eye view of placing defensive structures. fluid transition between the two.story-the story is very comedic and you will most likely laugh quite a few times. However, the story is very short I beat it in roughly 4 hours. The game is only $15 atm so I don't see that as a problem simply letting you know.This is the type of game you get mostly to play by yourself for some laughs or with friends as I did with the first game. I havn't tried the online feature yet so I will not comment whether or not it is good.  overall the game is what all games should try to be and that is ""FUN"". great game give it a try or watch a youtube video to see whether or not the gameplay is enjoyable too you."

Every inch of this game is just oozing with character, and the amount of small details and care that seemingly went into every design decision of this game is a pleasant experience to say the least. If you even remotely enjoyed the first title then I think purchasing this one, even at it's full price of 15 dollars, is a no brainer. If you're new to the series though, just know that if you find it interesting watching videos or trailers of it then this game will probably not only meet your expectations but exceed them. The world designs are absolutely beautiful, the game (as far as I can tell so far) has a massive veriety of content to choose from, and the gameplay itself is practically flawless.I will update my review once I have put more time into this game (if needed), but I'm just so excited to be playing this game that I just had to share my thoughts.

,Recommended,434460,34578301,Posted: 29 August,all,Xark,"My review after the first playthorugh on Normal difficulty:I'm a huge fan of this idea and loved the first game!But this game feels quite different compared to the first one, but not in a bad way.Here is why!1st: You are way faster!This means that corners are really annoying and in most maps best chokepoint to bring your enemy to a hold.But it also means that avoiding obstacle of your opponment often is a bad choice.Simply because you gain so much speed in such a few seconds that it doesn't matter that you crush through 2-4 layers of walls before. Also it is more beneficial to destroy the obstacle for your further runs, so just ram through nearly everything in your path(exept animals, they will stop you)2nd: Being heavily damaged doesn't really matter.If you have 100% or just 45% hp, you will crush through everything evenly.Further the dmg you will cause at the gate changes just a little.So if you plan the obstacles for you opponment, keep in mind that your goal has either to stop him long enough to gain time advantage or to destroy his boulder completly, because hurting him a bit doesn't help.3rd: Your traps/obstacles are much different.Sure most of it exists in the 1st game, but some behave way different.To example the cows arent just a single cow to stand in the way, no they are 5 in a 3x3 area and they are sticky and therefore immobilize the enemyMoreover there is now a limitation of how many you can place from each(Like only 3 goldmines and you can't place them anywhere anymore)Also it saddened me that breaking surroundings doesn't give much money anymore, sure you get alot when you reach the gate but I found it to be very tactical to calulate into your runs that you might destroy some houses on your way to gain cash.4th: In my opinion the mapdesigne didn't get better.The maps are fun and some have nice features, but I personaly like every map from the 1st game better.Most maps are way too flat and square-ish with no height difference, the first game had much much more variation. Some maps have too much areas were you can't build at the sides so a normal player simply rolls around your traps.Beneficial shortcuts are very rare and aren't quite risky.5Th: The boulder variations are very nice!Many different boulders with unique effects and abilites.To example a boulder that makes a smal area unusable when you jump, but then it got lower stats than the standard boulder like it is slower and does less dmgI bet in competitive there will be very nice constelations between boulder and traps people will use.6th: The gamemodes aren't all that new but they work and are fun.But I haven't tested them against a real person yet.In conclusion this game is a very solid piece of software and for 15€ you are on the good side buying it.Unique concept, lovely design, lots of humour and best game to ruin friendships because that f*cking d*ckface placed too f*icking many towers at that corner c*unt, b*tch, ****, *****, ****!!!..You should buy it :)"

The campaign is pretty brief, so if you want to extend its life maybe get a friend to play with you. A lot of the jokes are artistically, literarily and historically based, so if you're not at least a little knowledgeable about culture from ancient times up to the Enlightenment some of the humor might be lost on you."

The added variety and slight changes to gameplay rules make the game a must have for some casual enjoyment. Now you can even play with your friends on local mode, but you can still play it online (despite the long loading times for joining and exiting a match, and the dated server list concept).This game is definitely is a solid buy for $15, and you've earned my $X.xx for future dlc"

Simply good fun.Multiplayer isn't very active so you'd better have some friends, though singleplayer is already worth it.A couple of small gripes: This could use another game mode or something, because currently the ""offroad"" parts of each level are wasted. Sometimes you can take a shortcut and get back on the path, but the game thinks you fell completely off and resets your position. Another annoying thing is long periods of waiting with nothing to do."

A war match feels more strategic now as you have to choose your defences and boulders right at the beginning of every game. The campaign map is very charming and gives you more freedom of choice.Is there something I don't like? Well, golden keys cannot be collected in a map directly anymore, only through difficulty setting. Fast matchmaking doesn't always work for me - however, the netcode seems a lot more stable than in RoA1 and you can choose from a list of available games now.The options menu really deserves its name - Unreal Engine 4 runs perfectly fine even on my old system.All in all, RoA2 is an awesome successor to an awesome game."

CO OP CAMPAIGN.--- UPDATE: I basically beat the core game (except the racing). It's only got like... 6-8 hours of gameplay. But it is REALLY FUN. Really funny. I'm definitely going to come back and finish the racing tomorrow.Physics are really satistfying to smash through walls and stuff.Flaws? Very ffrustrating game mechanics sometime when you encounter edge cases (the core game is fun). The game ""feels"" like it cheats you. You miss things. You go flying off. You can't make any turns. The first game felt more in control. And in this one, the enemy balls will fall off by your AWESOME defenses... and then get to START PAST THEM. Whereas when YOU DIE you start behind them. It feels like B.S. when you're neck-and-neck.HOWEVER, overall, the game is really fun. If you watch the trailer, you're gonna know whether you want this game almost immediately between the Monty Python-style cinematics, and the Monkey Ball + Tower Defense game mechanics.IMPROVEMENTS over the 1st game? CO OP CAMPAIGN. New item or ball unlocked for every battle. No ""tiered"" weapons. Catapult is a catapult. There's no level 1/2/3 catapult. That forces you to think solely in terms of rock/paper/scissors and it's the game mechanics are much more fine-tuned as a result.Rating 9/10   (Amazing original game, with some bugs and minor flaws that can be frustrating.)Biggest flaw? --> MORE CONTENT PLEASE. It's SOOOO GOOD we need more! My wife and I binge played it every day since it came out. I'd even ""pay"" (normally ::sadface::) for an expansion pack if it added significant amounts of maps, weapons, and other stuff. (No tiny DLCs. Give us more real content!)   This game is worth $15. But because of the lack of later content currently, it's NOT worth more than that. If you're NOT a big fan of the concept, it'll probably be worth ~$7.5-$10. But I HATE tower defense games and this one doesn't feel like it at all. It's Monkey Ball + ""dear god, stop their monkey ball from getting in!""Thank you guys for making this game. I'll likely make a YouTube video soon featuring it, as I have a series in the making on ""Unique Games Worth Playing.""

I bought this game shortly after release and I have absolutely no regrets.The game has a multiplayer adversarial (up to) 2v2 mode, and it's a TON of fun after finishing the story mode. You don't even have to play the story mode to unlock everything, if you don't want to, and you can unlock stuff through playing multiplayer.There's tons of strategies and unit combinations to try in defense of your castle against your friends, and it's a lot of fun to try and get past all of their defenses. It's a lot more enthralling than playing against the AI!There is definitely a learning curve to be had with the game, particularly in setting up your defenses more than rolling your boulder. In a way, it's a subcategory of a tower defense game, and it's fantastic!For the replay value through the multiplayer and production quality of the game, it's got great purchase value."

,Recommended,434460,34569480,Posted: 28 August,all,POW TO YOU!,"Rock of Ages 2 takes almost everything I loved about the first one and improves upon it. The only thing I had issues with initially is the controls, which felt different, but after some getting used to they feel fine. The cutscenes are hilarious, and the animation and art direction in them adds to the humor. The art itself within the game is fantastic, as a lot of it is a reference to either RoA1 or an art piece/period from history. The music from what I can tell (I honestly haven't been listening that much, but a few have stuck out!) seems to be mostly classical music, as some new stuff, which is fitting in the game considering what the whole plot is.Online multiplayer (2v2, war) is very good fun too! I have not come across any connectivity issues, or any odd bugs/glitches in multiplayer like in the original (which happened sometimes, but they happened enough to be annoying), and all in all it is very good fun.I like the unit changes as well, walls seemingly got a nerf as I can plow right through them with hardly any momentum loss, but cows are insanely strong now (sticky cows). The ""weapon"" you fire while the enemy is rolling out has been replaced by lightning, which is a lot more fun to aim and hit than catapult (?) from RoA1.Overall, if you like the first one, this is an absolute must buy! If you're unsure, I would recommend this over the first due to the improved gameplay, graphics, and campaign (bosses seem to be a lot more fun, but little disclaimer, I have only played one so far). If you do end up enjoying this, buying the first one wouldn't hurt either, it's more rock of ages after all!"

,Recommended,434460,34567676,Posted: 28 August,all,Jerry Smith,"Rock of Ages 2: Bigger, Boulder, Badder and BoujeeierThe original Rock of Ages is one of, if not the best indie games to come out over the last few years in my opinion. The premise is you and your opponent want to (literally) crush one another, and do so by unleashing (living???) rocks unto one another. In order to hinder each other, whilst the rock is being chisled out and made able to be rolled down the hill, you each have the ability to place obstacles in the way of the opposing rock as to make your opponent's descent harder.This game expands on the original while retaining what made the original so much fun and laugh out loud hysterical. Each level is preceeded with a creative cutscene showcasing why the protagonist and the antagonist are at arms with each other, each somehow funnier than the last. As someone who was never into history, the varying art styles do much in the way of seperating the game into time periods as well as adding to the beauty and creativity of each cutscene. From a gameplay perspective, the devs clearly took note of some of the spammier units that plagued the original game (cough cough Airship units) and decided on rebalancing units all around with both the monetary system of the original as well as a  limit of how many can be placed at a time. These changes coupled with the new rock system of each having unique abilities, a limit to how many different units can be equipped per battle, and the new bank system really add together to make an overall better and more strategy based game than last time around.Lastly, the little things, like the rocks squealing when leaving the play area and the iconic squishing noise when you roll over your enemy return and made this an instant buy for me.Just buy this game. Did I mention split screen multiplayer???"

Plus flaming giraffes.This has to be one of the greatest sequels i've ever seen to a game. It takes everything from the original and adds to it, removing the issues and keeping all the charm we love. I was a huge fan of the original and I couldn't be happier with whats been given here, especially for only $15Pros:-Co-op Campaign-The maps are much more detailed and inventive, some are even hard to traverse normally which to me is a good thing-The story is just as good as the first. Historical people from all ages in history show up and with a nice mix of humour. It's also less linear than the first game, you get to choose which route you want to take.-They fixed just about everything i disliked in the original (No more placing 9 tile units into 1 tile, that sort of stuff)-Plenty of new and fun units to play around with. I also love how cows work in this game (reminds me of playing rugby, which way is the ball gonna bounce, NOONE KNOWS!)-Different boulders aren't just cosmetic anymore, each one has different stats and abilities. which also got rid of the boulder upgrades in the war gamemode which I always thought were kinda dumb.-2V2 multiplayer. FANTASTIC, I cannot tell you how much i've wanted this.-More customization, boulders can be painted with different stripes and colours aswell as your own banner.-The boulders actually feel like boulders this time around instead of paper mache. The jumps are small and the boulders are harder to stop and destroy.-Attacking gates isn't decided by your boulder ""size"" and speed anymore but rather what health you have left and the speed you're going, theres also helpful numbers after you hit the gate so you know just how much damage you did.I don't think i've played enough to discover most of the cons in this game but here are the ones i've found thus farCons:-Not being able to place units on pre-existing towers ingame, or just placing units on towers period. Not a big issue but something I would like to see.-No new gamemodes. This isn't terrible and I really don't mind but to see some new gamemodes would have been nice.Overall if you enjoyed the first one you will really like Bigger and Boulder.

It's just as hilarious, and bizzare, as the first game. However, the changes made with this game are huge. For instance, all rock types now have differing stats, except for the skins  available to them. This is not even the biggest change, because now you have to select units. boulders take up 2 slots whiles units only take up 1, you can have up to 4 boulders and 1 unit total or have a singles boulder with 7 units, by unlockings slots. Speaking of which, the story mode no longer is used to unlock maps, rather it is used to gain more items, abilities and the slots i mentioned earlier. It definitely feels a bit more refined the original in this manner. it does make your choice in units way different, meaning that other people/ the ai, may not have the same units as you, keeping it rather diverse instead of just giving both teams the same units. So far, i am definitely enjoying what i have played. It's more of the same but improved like a sequel should be."

When I started playing, I didn't like it, but I found myself continuing to play the next levels/maps.In the beginning I felt a little overwhelmed, but as I played more and more I got used to how the game plays. I have since noticed that this game can involve serious strategic decisions (in the case of the WAR gammode). There are many different ways to play your match to lead you to a ""crushing"" victory. Thats what I like the most about this game.The art style is another high point for me. It looks pretty on my pc and I love how each of the maps reflect on a certain period of time (hence the name Rock of Ages).The music is fun and helps set the tone of each map. It can cause a good laugh when the soundtrack picks up as you are rolling your boulder to the enemy base at a high speed.I also like how different boulders have different abilities which again leads in to my point of the strategies involved in this game.Overall I would recommend this game because it is a lot of fun both singleplayer and multiplayer. I am also excited to see what the devs may add in future patches.EDIT: Some of the things I dislike about the game are the lack of instructions in the tutorial. It was hard to learn the game because I had not played RoA1. Another dislike is the little instruction given for the boss battles. It does make it challenging, which I don't mind, but i could be rolling around for hours trying to find out what to do. To go along with that the boss battles, once you figure out how to beat them, are very short."
,Recommended,434460,34737152,Posted: 4 September,all,TPI | Starwolf1991,"2011 saw the release of 'Rock Ages', a hybrid of ball racing and tower defense.  It was a very different concept; battling historical and mythlogical figures throughout the ages of human history with a giant boulder and assorted defenses on obstacle course-styled maps. Throw in some Monty Python-esq comedy and many a pop culture reference. It was not only different; it was brilliant too.Fast foward six years into 2017 and we have yet another brilliant release. This time, we have the sequel, 'Rock of Ages 2: Bigger and Boulder.'Rock of Ages 2: Bigger and Boulder takes the concept and finer qualities of the original game and refines them, while introducing many new features. The level design at each of the battle locations is now more clever. Better varied for layout and uniqueness, they are also aesthetically appropriate for the cast of characters and famous artworks which are your opponents. One example I had to reallly appreciate was the surrealist style of Salvador Dali, brought to life whilst fighting the Burning Giraffe. Another thing worthy of appreciation is the requirement of now having to choose what boulders and defenses to equip before battle; the arsenal consisting of many toys returning from Rock of Ages as well as new ones. This adds a welcome invitation to strategy and experimentation, which you will have to do a fair amount of at the various locations. This applies to both singleplayer and the new two vs two online multiplayer modes. Finally, it is hard not to laugh and smile at the wackiness of the game's cinematics and boss fights. There is no shortage of the Monty Python-esq comedy or the pop culture references. How many will you recognize?All in all, I believe this is a sequel done right and a damn memorable one of that! Rock of Ages 2: Bigger and Boulder earns a well deserved spot in what I feel should be a list of 'Video games of 2017 you must play.'"

If you want to know more about them go watch Youtube videos or read other reviews.Rock of Ages 2 is a sequel to Rock of Ages, which was released in 2011. The point was to destroy the enemy castle door with a big boulder. The opponent also has a boulder and both of you need to build defences while the boulder is being built by each side. It's a race to who is the first one to destroy castle door and killing the opponent. Rock of Ages 2 is pretty much the same, but refined.Refinements include:- Having an option to choose boulder to use. They have different strengths and weaknesses, so be strategic- You can customize your flag, units colors and boulder which game will show in every match you are in.- Banks are now required to be built near mines, which generate extra income.- Boulder doesn't have three layers anymore and now it does damage (to castle door) based on health alone and shows damage number.- You can finally build a proper wall instead of separate towers.- There are less defence options, but they do have more variation, giving you more options for different strategies.The game otherwise is very similar, but it's not a bad thing. As matter of fact, it's a very good thing considering that it doesn't add any unnecessary changes that completely change the game. It's just....refined. It's the gameplay and style you already liked.Art-style, humour and soundtrack are still the best elements just as in Rock of Ages. Graphics look fantastic and are reminiscent of actual historic art and paintings. Just look at the screenshots in this game's front page. The game does look exactly like that, so I can confirm that there are no bullshots.Rock of Ages 2 has more music, and every stage has it's own score. They are redesigned and remixed from classical music scores intending to sound more action centered and a bit twisted. If someone really finds classical music boring and too slow, they should listen the soundtrack of this game.The game overall doesn't make any sense in terms of character actions and story. As many have said, it's suppose to be very monty python like with 2D cardboard characters. Cutscenes show historical figures doing something bizarre (the jokes usually tend to reflect something they did, but not always) You most of the time have no real reason to fight these figures, but who cares honestly. Cutscene's main point is to make you laugh and find excuses to fight these guys. If cutscenes don't make you laugh, I advice to skip this game and play something else.Technical side; Rock of Ages 2 performs really well. I don't really have an amazing specs in my computer, but I can run Rock of Ages 2 with ultra settings. Only major frame drops I noticed were in volcano level and sometimes when psychics went crazy. I rarely find a game nowadays that looks great and performs well. Usually just it's one way or the other.There are few flaws. Sometimes bot seems to have unfair advantage as it seems to do more damage to gate despite it having exact same stats and speed. At early stage of single player campaign, the bot has more defences and boulders that are locked for you. They most likely made it the way it is to balance the game, but it still can be slightly annoying.Boss fights were major flaw in first Rock of Ages and yet devs didn't fix this in Rock of Ages 2. You cannot lose them (to my knowledge) because you just respawn when boulder is destroyed and bosses don't really do their 100%. Most of the attacks you can dodge so easily and only slight challenge I encountered was with Sphinx because it could destroy your boulder with one attack and even that was easy. Boss fights are suppose to be really challenging or atleast more difficult than standard stages. Bot offers more challenge even in normal difficulty than bosses, which really speaks for itself. Also, why show the weak point when you could just give indirect hint. In thinker fight they did that (though honestly they did show that in in-game cutscene for some reason), so why even show weak point in cutscene. Most players would've figure that out after multiple tries. This honestly gives me an impression that the game thinks players are morons.Rock of Ages 2 is unfortunately short game and it takes 3-4 hours to complete the single player campaign. Single player honestly offers the best parts. As much content is has, like multiplayer and some game modes, I have no interest with playing multiplayer or co-op with randoms due to my social anxiety. I don't have any friends who own this game, which makes multiplayer aspect pointless for me. Also there isn't (online) co-op for single player campaign, which is just a minor thing, but still unfortunate.There are some other minor things. Sometimes when you and jump and fall off, you are placed on the opposite side instead of the point from where you jumped. A.I is most of the time good, but sometimes it does weird things when it's controlling the boulder.Yet, I should say that with it's low price and fun single player campaign, I was sadisfied with the final product. There are no microtransactions or season passes. If you liked the original game, you should definitely buy Rock of Ages 2. For new comers, I would highly recommend buying a bundle which include both games.8/10"

The AI is well rounded.What you dont want to play are the boss fights of campaign mode.by design these battles a sluggish crawls , where you slowly prance up to the boss and bop em on the nose lightly. Luckily its only two times, rather than the standard 3. However for the Sphinx battle you are unpleasantly greeted with a second phase; in which you have twice as many attacks to dodge, leading to missing your already extremely small attack window.This is then followed up with a Foosball final boss, my god is this abysmal. you take turns controlling your boulder, then Atlas' paddles.Controlling the BoulderYou are tasked with once again, tumbling toward the goal at 2 mph. in which Zeus has nearly perfect defense, so you'll end up rolling into hiis goalie for 30 seconds straight until you miraculously move around this barrier which moves the exact speed you do.Controlling AtlasYou now get to play a ""Regular game"" of Foosball for these sections, there are strings attached. That spin move that Zeus constantly does, you cant do that. IN FACT, pressing a causes you to swing the paddle forward, then back before returning to neutral. Meaning 95% of the time you'll score on yourself.There is a small chance you'll destroy the boulder, which you better ♥♥♥♥ing pray for because without this you're likely to tie, which doesnt result in a victory, or even a sudden death.OH and the best part, its SIX MINUTES long. each attempt. is six minutesOverall I give this game a '♥♥♥♥ the bosses'/10"

That was all until I got to the last stage in the campaign. This stage is centered around Ramses the Great of Ancient Egypt. Let me tell you right now this is possibly one of the worst stages in a video game that I have ever played. First off Ramses A.I. is the toughest in the game. Which is fine because of the path I took through the game he was the last stage before a boss fight. However this A.I. is the biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I have ever seen. Ramses rock always spawns before yours does even if yours is the balloon rock that is one of the fastest to spawn in a game. Ramses also likes to spam both banks on both of the mines so he has enough money to place every unit that has ever exsisted on the map. By the way the map is the worst in the game. The map has one part where if you dont come to a complete and utter stop in a matter of miliseconds you will go off the edge and trust me you are going to need be as fast as possible to beat his dumb♥♥♥♥♥ so if you go off the cliff once playing against him you will lose. This part of the game also has the problem of being complete and utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The only time that I ever came close to beating him I was screwed out of it by the game leaving this guy with 1 HP left on his door even though I hit him with full speed and very little damage to my rock. Let me just say I am definatly no expert gamer or stratigest but when you put the A.I. on ♥♥♥♥ing easy, pretty much anyone should be able to beat it. I still have not though. I refuse to play this game after that. This is the stage ruins the game. It is awful and I hate it. If I were you I would not pay 10 cents for this game."

Also on ""HARD"" it only makes the AI break causing it to be able to go out of bounds without being reset. this happened many times. Nothing else about game will change. With the advertising of the game I was at least expecting some levels to really WOW me, which was not the case. The viewing angle and control for building units is confusing. At the start, there is no sense of direction or map control. You cannot zoom out far enough to see large parts of the course. There is no timer present informing you on how much time is left to build or to re roll. Only 3 or so boulders are worth using and the game gives no reason or incentive to use the large selection of boulders.  I was a huge fan of the first game. I enjoyed the second game also!

I loved the cutscenes, very Pythonesque, as well as all the historical references.  The courses are lovely to look at and satisfying to smash through.  I can't figure out what classical piece is hidden in the ""Dada Desert"" track in the soundtrack though..."

,Recommended,434460,34566867,Posted: 28 August,all,Big Will,"Exactly as the name suggests, this has everything you might love about the first game, but now everything is bigger and bolder. This time around units aren't in tiers, instead there are many new unique units to use. You get boulders to choose from and switch between during the game, which includes boulders with different stats (like balloon boulders and explosive boulders), but also cosmetic variants of other boulders. The units and boulders are unlocked through either the campaign or multiplayer matches. Either way is fun, but I recommend doing the story first. Each of the (currently 15) maps has a specific art style and design, as well as it's own music. The graphics are stunning on ultra, and the physics are very fun. The story campaign is awesome, and the cinematics before every level are genuinely hilarious. Last and certainly not least there is now 2v2 multiplayer, letting me play with more of my friends at once.12 hours in: I've gotten all the stars in the campaign (33), all the gold medals in the time trial for each map, and every achievement. Completing this game was a blast, and I look forward to any future updates or DLC the game might get (A new and improved skiiboulder?:D ). Until then, I'll be enjoying the multiplayer with my friends.Kudo again to everyone on the ACE team on this one! All the games you guys work on are amazing - and this was no exception."

After a recent mildly dissapointing expirience of magicka 2 I am super glad that to find that Rock of Ages 2 feels like it could be even more fun than the first, although its impossible to tell after only 2 hours of playing, this game has a suprisingly deep level of stratergy to learn especialy when fighting against ones brother or close friends. it also now features FOUR PLEAYER which will be endless fun im sure!It has also built on the excilent humour and amazing art style of the previouse game hugely succesfully, which is something I was slightly doubting it would do from just looking at the official videos, but its pulled it of excilently!"

76561198055761331,Recommended,434460,34674691,Posted: 1 September,all,Numero Undecim,"Fun and appealing. A worthy successor of the original title. Instead of moving through the ages we now follow Atlas and the Boulder on a map of Europe and Middle East through a variety of different levels representing different art styles spanning from Ancient Greek to Dali-like modernism sprinkled with cartoon-ish and totally historically-accurate humour, and an awesome soundtrack.The principle stays the same, 'boulder' phase where we control a giant rock to crush the gates and defenses of the enemy, and  'defense' phase where we build up our own defenses in the hope that the enemy rock doesn`t reach our gates. Now, however, we are presented with a choice of what boulder(s) and defense mechanisms (or animals) to fit into our inventory before the start of the level.My only concern, is that the single-player campaign feels a bit short: doing only the war levels you can finish it in about 5 hours. There are other activities, like time trials or obstacle courses, but they utilise the same maps. Haven`t tried out multiplayer so far.Overall, highly recommended if you liked the first one, or you always felt like Monty Python cartoons deserved to be mimicked in a 2017 indie tower defense/boulder rolling simulator."

,Recommended,434460,34794011,Posted: 7 September,all,Dicksnot,"Prior to playing this game upon the recomendation of some tophatted neckbeard on youtube I had no Idea that all historical conflicts were resolved by rolling massive boulders at each other and smushing their armies.The game's first cutscene set me straight.Crushes it's predecessor, all round improvement10/10 would squish joan of ark again."
,Recommended,434460,34821589,Posted: 8 September,all,TimeyWimeyStuff,"at first i thought i was gonna end up asking for a refund for this game because im usually a fps/fighting game sort of guy, but the game itself is fun and sort of addicting, the story has halarious cutseens and the levels can get challenging but not so much that you will rage quit, and it actually takes a bit of thinking with placeing your units. the boss fights dont really seem like boss fights though and some of the normal levels are harder than most of the boss fights. I really reccomend this game if your the type of person that like deffend then attack sort of games or the person who likes games with a silly theme to it"

,Recommended,434460,35144156,Posted: 22 September,all,SummerTank,"A very successful indie sequel, Rock of Ages 2 is, as the title says, Bigger & Boulder. You still control a boulder and squish Monty Python-esque historical and mythological characters while you both try to hamper each other's boulders with creative defenses. It is a game that will make you chuckle if you're into this type of humor.There are more balls and more game modes, including full online multiplayer support. The levels are visually impressive and creatively designed, they are truly a sight to behold.Having said that, I felt that the campaign mode was somewhat shorter than the first game's. If you blast through it, it won't last more than 5 hours. If you are really into challenges and multiplayer you might stretch the game to 15+ hours, so I suppose that if you're looking for something that can keep you entertained for months you might have to look elsewhere. Personally I feel that the price is justified, but I wouldn't blame anyone for waiting for a sale."
