I picked this game since its fast to download (300mb) , looked like a game that I could easily get into and the price is almost nothing.The graphics are old-looking, but in my opinion kinda charming. The ak-47 looks like something taken out of the counter strike 1.6 era, but the game plays like a fast-paced, crazy FPS, serious sam/shadow warrior sort of game. The graphics was obviously made this was to be more of a humorous type of game.The story doesn't make much sense and the voice-acting is pretty bad, but who cares. This is a game mostly focused on silly gameplay where you murder hordes of monsters and animals for a while. This game actually had more depth then I expected for the price, lots of characters to pick between, some sort of upgrade system, new unlockable levels, cheat mode enabled once you clear 30 waves, and so on.I think the psysics are fun and satisfying in this game. Monster splatter to pieces when you shot them up with a shotgun, and I also tried out a revolver and what looked like a desert eagle pistol. There is some bugs and glitches here and there, but I got some laughs out of this little game anyway. Includes steam trading cards as well, so you can actually make your money back, or close to, by just selling the cards. Also achievements, stats and controller support for those that like that.If you just want a little bit of fun alone or with friends ( yes, it has co-op) then by all means pick this up. Just don't expect to much in terms of graphics or story. Blood and bacon does have 100+ levels though, so gameplay-wise it actually have a lot of content for the asking price.I say like Macklemore, ""but sh*t, it was 99 cents... """

There isn't much more than that. But is this game a bloody mess, or does it really bring home the bacon?This Multiplayer (Up To 4P) ""Survival Horror FPS"" has Day and Night levels, players will take on 35 enemy types and numerous bosses, like Gargantuan Monsters and Minibosses every 10 days as you explore, shoot and run for your life against the onslaught of porcine monstrosities.The StoryYou and/or a couple of your friends are trapped at a farm in a barn along with The Farmer, who is nailed to the wall with a pitchfork. He's actually pretty funny, and his monotone voice works with that really well. He has a ton of guns and ammo in the barn for you to go out each day and destroy the demon pigs that have taken over his farm. That's really it. This game doesn't have or need much story. You go outside and blow up pigs. It's goofy and it works really well.GameplayThe game itself is very fun to put it short. Expecially with friends, which is what the game was made for. Each day there is a number of pigs outside on the farm, and your goal is to destroy them all. It's super bloody and bits of pig go everywhere. On the farm there are water pumps that heal you, and electric fence you can activate to fry pigs, and a huge meat grinder, that you can push pigs into to get grenades, ammo, etc. There are a few secrets to find as well. Like I said earlier, the game is very L4D, so you have a primary and secondary you can grab from the barn each day, unlocking more every so often for more pure carnitage (I had to). If you run out of health, you fall down into last stand mode where a friend must pick you up. It's silly, bloody, and really fun to play with a friend or three.All in All Blood and Bacon is a really nice Action Game!9/10 From MeSweep"

76561198166230474,Recommended,434570,27540684,"Posted: 25 November, 2016",all,Max Is Back,"Blood and Baconis a first-person shooter that pits you (and, optionally, up to 5 others in co-op mode) against hordes of deadly steroid-infused pigs. Some are small, some are big, some are HUGE, some are metal(?), some have apparently misplaced their skin and are entirely skeletal - but there are two things that they all have in common:1. They pose a severe risk to human life, especially yours.2. They must be humanely destroyed by a qualified veterinarian to avert a major public health hazard.The bad news is that they presumably killed all the qualified veterinarians so you'll have to do the job yourself. The good news is that you have a far more appropriate set of tools than the average vet - these include pistols, shotguns, machine guns, grenades and more.The basic format of the game is a round-based FPS where each round is represented by a new day. A round can consist of anywhere between a few and a fewhundredangry hogs. Each day you're given instructions by the Farmer, who needs your help to stem the tide of porcine peril because, for some inexplicable reason, one of his legs is missing and he's pinned to the wall of his barn with a pitchfork. The Farmer's musings are often hilarious and his voice-acting is great, but each day's task needs little explanation: kill the pigs -allthe pigs!There's only one map (the farm itself) and it's not very big. But there are various tools scattered about the environment to assist you in your task - an electric fence that will quickly turn any nearby pigs into pork scratchings, a meat grinder that (somehow) turns pig carcasses into useful pickups (ammo, grenades, power-ups) and water fountains from which you can replenish your health. Your arsenal of weapons and the tools around the farm are unlocked as the days go by but it won't take long to unlock everything you need for some serious pig-slaughtering mayhem. There are also plenty of secrets and easter eggs to be found all around the game.Every 10th day you'll encounter a mini-boss and every 20th day you'll encounter amassiveboss, so large that its final destruction produces an eruption of pig gibs that turns the entire sky red with blood. It's hard to describe just how satisfying this is but perhaps a quick screen-shot will help:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=806168815Not quite enough blood with your bacon? Well hold on there partner, we're just getting started:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=806169966Still not enough blood for you? Then you should probably seek professional psychiatric help. Moving on, there are also periodic ""revenge days"" where every weapon is loaded with explosive ammunition; let's just say things get messy.Originally an XBox Live Arcade title, it has now made the glorious transition to Steam where it has rapidly grown bigger, better and brasher than it ever was on the humble XBox 360. Developer ""Big Corporation"" is very active in the community, respects community feedback, implements good suggestions in a timely fashion, makes regular updates to the game and is all in all a great guy. Big Corporation genuinely loves the game and is constantly improving it, something I respect and admire in a developer.It's a simple but satisfying game and notably offers exceptional value for money - $0.99 (or your regional equivalent) at full price and you'll often find it on sale for 10% or even 20% off, so it could be yours from the spoils of a quick rummage down the back of the sofa for loose change. Needless to say, it's hardly going to compete with your triple-A FPS games but rest assured you get a whole lot of game (and a whole lot of fun) for the extremely modest price of admission.This is my nomination for the 2016 Steam Awards' ""Best Use of a Farm Animal"" category because what better use can there possibly be than turning it into an excessively bloody mess with an arsenal of lethal weaponry? It's a serious question, feel free to answer in the comments!So to wrap things up, pros and cons? Honestly, at this point you don't need a list of pros and cons since you should have stopped reading by now and bought it already - did I mention it costs less than a dollar?"

It's easy to find the graphic settings, the controls, the co-op, and single player buttons, not to mention the audio itself.Getting into the actual gameplay, It's amazing. Although the farmer is very annoying, but for what you pay for the game it is really good. The guns are really good, and powerful at low rounds, and as you progress it gets harder to kill the boars. Getting into the days, I think 101 days is a little bit long to play, but if you have the time it's fun, and the characters themselves are great to play as.The bosses get harder every 10 days which is really challenging and fun. I love the aspect that they can heal so that they don't die so easily, and you have to actually do a lot of hard work to kill them, but the best part of the bosses is the names for the fat pig that's in the middle.Getting on to the grinder. The grinder is amazing, but it is used for powerups which is also a great addition to the game, and make sit much better to play for something else other than just killing boars that are on steroids, but apart from that stuff that's all there is to the grinder.Getting on the farmer himself. He is funny, but also annoying. His jokes aren't that great, and could be worked on a little bit, but apart from that the farmer is a great guy. Especially when you shoot him, and he starts getting mad, and eventually throws stuff at you.Getting on the boars. There is a mix of boar's from small to large, and from skeletons, to bosses, and from boar's to pigs. The game on a whole is amazing, and I love it.Getting on to the price. The price of the game should be more, because of how fun the game is especially when you play with friends, and have a laugh with them. So I recommend the price should be set atleast at £2.50, and not 0.75. I'm not complaining about it being so cheap, but I think it should be more.On a whole I would recommend anyone to get this game that enjoys shooter genres, and loves to play co-op with friends.I would rate this game a 10/10, and that you should buy it if you have a spare £0.79P.S.

You meet a pitchforked farmer in the barn who let you out for the missions. His quotes are quite funny. In the end you must survive 101 days. In your progress you get some useful weapons and powerups at the meat grinder. Each 10 days comes a new challenging boss. Though those graphics are really awkward but the gameplay makes quite fun. Exploding pigs in blood fountains are next to harmless playing music and butterflies flying around. There are several types of pigs like boars, zombie pigs, skeleton pigs and even robo-pigs.

Mostly though, it's all about pig carnage....pigs, demonic pigs, undead pigs, tiny fast little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pigs, gargantuan♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off boss pigs, etc....As you progress through to new days, new weapons will unlock, and there is also a meat grinder, which when filled with pig body parts and shot in the right spot, will churn out ammo and disposable weapons during battles. The grinder also sees upgrades as you progress. There is also an electric fence that can make short work of your enemies who are standing near it.You are encouraged, berated, and generally bossed around by the farmer, who is impaled on a wall in the barn with a missing leg that was clearly torn off, as there is bone sticking out, lol. He is pretty funny and also can be a total♥♥♥♥♥♥ but sometimes it's your own fault (since you will inevitably feel the urge to shoot him, shine your flashlight in his face, and otherwise mess with him). Basically, he represents the start of a new level (day) before and after each battle.There is also in battle healing, via water pumps located around the farm.

You, a mysterious stranger must assist a Farmer... tormented by the evil he has unwittingly unleashed upon this land, surviving round after round hordes of blood thirsty swine. You can feel the pain and anguish the Farmer feels as he pleads with you to help cleanse his farm from the armies of boars that gather upon his barns doorsteps daily... as they grow ever so stronger each day. You will be moved to tears as hear him pitifully try to be optimistic in this hell... cracking jokes to keep your spirits going as he hangs there, slowly bleeding to death in agonizing pain from a pitchfork pierced deep within his gut.The stunning graphics make it all look almost real as I've never seen a game looked quite this gorgeous, the attention to detail the developers gave is incredible to say the least. The voice acting is phenominal and is deserving of an Oscar as I felt a connection with the farmer... I empathized his struggle and knew exaclty what he was feeling... regret for his sins... the feeling of hanging onto whatever sliver of optimism you can in a dark and seemingly hopeless hell in which he is living in. The futility of struggle as every time you conquer an army of hell spawn, the next day brings upon an even greater obstacle than the last, but you must tread on... for the Farmer...The story is filled with action, drama, and mystery as you must battle your way forward... day and night to uncover the truth of what happened here... slaughtering tens of thousands of swine by your hand, for you shall become death incarnate...Mortem Incarnatum..."

It's been less than a week since the pig-tastic Iron Snout found its way onto Steam, and now we have more bloodthirsty porcine madness in the form of Blood and Bacon.  My opinion of this game?  It's quite simply one of the dumbest, yet funnest, games you're ever liable to play.  Yeah, it's stoopid.  Stoopid and bloody and gross.  And sure the graphics aren't exactly ""next-gen"".  But if you're looking for something silly to satisfy the Serious Sam in you, this game will do just the trick.  All this, and it's only a ♥♥♥♥ING DOLLAR!Let me put it some other ways.  Have you ever felt like being vomited and projectile♥♥♥♥♥♥upon by a gigantic pig called Princess Blubbergut?  Yeah, me neither, but turns out it's actually pretty fun.  Ever wanted a game where shooting enemies not only in the face but in the♥♥♥♥♥does more damage than standard shots?  Yup, you get the idea.  All this, and missions handed out by a farmer pinned to a barn wall by a pitchfork, who somehow never seems to die for weeks on end.  You can even shoot him repeatedly in the face for an achievement!In short, almost everything about this game is pretty hilarious:  The gore, the achievements, the farmer's dialogue, the voice acting.  This game basically achieves everything it sets out to achieve, and that's a rare thing these days, even when a game's ambitions aren't incredibly high.  My only complaint is that it was initially a bit of a trick to get the thing to go full-screen and to work out some of the keys - it was designed more for X-Box and a controller - but hopefully the dev will sort that stuff out soon.  Entertaining, unpretentious, and dirt-cheap.  If only more ""Big Corporation""s behaved this way!Verdict: 8/10."

There's really no way around it as you'll be doing mostly the same thing for most waves (that is, shooting purcines until they die/ gib/ explode while trying not to be gored to death): some variety can come from armored enemies that you must shoot in the back or bosses that require a bit of strategy but that's all.Said repetitiveness is also made stronger by the overall lack of different enemy models and the fact you'll be seeing the same two bosses types over and over every ten days with- at most- only slight changes in how they work.As for what it does right well, the game is extremely easy to pick up and play and the fact each day is so short means you can give it a quick go even if you have little time. The toilet humor can be funny at times- if you're ok with that brand of humor ofc- and the huge amount of gibs/ blood on screen is as amusing as it is satisfying to see after you've managed to clear a particularly hard day. While basic the gameplay can also be quite challenging especially when playing solo as certain enemies can kill you in a few hits if you let them get too close: same goes for bosses as they'll require a good amount of concentration to succeed.For me Blood and Bacon was a fun yet slightly dull and somewhat forgettable experience, an one trick pony if you wish: but for a dollar I feel I got enough enjoyment from it to justify its purchase hence my thumbs up. As for you well, it's quite decent if you're looking for something silly to play in short bursts, even more so with a friend."

The game does only leech of one map but thats more than enough with the map being filled with easter eggs, fun, etc... It's a great way to mess around with friends, it's fun since the game is just Left 4 Dead but just on a farm, even the little details make the game a whole lot better like the day where you can go full rambo and explode pigs with a single bullet which does make quite the spectacle and the where you keep shooting a part of a pig upwards causing a combo to appear which can lead to fireworks, just the game overall is easy to enjoy if you have the right things set, but not every game is perfect, as I said before the game does only have one map which can be quite limiting for the players since they can only keep playing though one map and this game is alot better played with firends so if you don't have friends who play the game and you only play singleplayer then you're not getting the full potential of the game but you can always play with strangers but its not as fun. Back to the verdict of the game, I do recommend this game to people who have time to kill and friends to play with and you can always play by yourself aswell, it's a nice arcade like shooter offering quite abit for a small package which can offer many laughs from the plot to the easter eggs."

It may not be the most AAA title from popular developers, but that does not make this game just as good. Not only did this game meet my standards but also exceeded. This game when above and beyond the Call of Duty (which this game is nothing like).Story- well to say the least of the story, there is one that i haven't exactly found out. This games story makes you really dig deep into the game, as they did not just do cut scenes and put the story out in the open. I personally like this approach to the game, as this makes the game more deep then you would think on first hand when playing the game.Game play-The single player was fun to play through without cheats, although cheats are a totally viable option (if you want every day to be revenge day). I couldn't test the multi player as i didn't have any friends who play this game. However- they put in a whole alpha phase to the multi player (meaning it is currently being tested) and they put in a harder game mode for the multi player if you want to, along with server commands. If you have friends, play it with them, it will only make the game more enjoyable. Single player is just as fun however, so either way you can not go wrong. The weapons in the game are just as good as you would expect them to be in other shooters. They are balanced, fun and easy to use, and not one gun is better then the other, so its all based on how you want to play. Although the number of guns you get are small, this is a good thing, so you are not over whelmed with what to pick and choose. Hit boxes are up to standards with other games.  This game also has gore to it, as the title suggests, meaning body parts go flying if the enemy is shot the right way. You can also kick them and complete an achievement with them.Sound-The sound in this game is very well made. This isn't a shooter that is supposed to be realistic, so don't go judging the game on that end. Instead, judge it on how clear the sound is. The sound is very clear  to say the least. There is also no sound delay, so you wont feel like the sound is lagging (this can be very frustrating)Graphics-Although the graphics are not like Destiny or Fall Out 4 on the PC, this game is not supposed to be like that. The graphics were made to please the eye, while also being not so strong that you cant play it on non gaming or old PCs, or even a laptop. I got 60 Frames Per Second (FPS) while played this game every time I did. I never Experienced any lag except if I had a browser open while playing, but this is because my laptop is not the most graphically enhanced. This game is about the experience, and not the power about it (even an achievement for turning up the ""graphics"" lol).Over all rating-If you like shooter games, this does not fall below even the most modern shooters. This game visually gives me a vibe of Retro games like Left 4 Dead, while still giving me a sensation that describes the most modern games.This game could have easily been priced up to 30 dollars for how good it is, but the developers decided to put the game to just a dollar, to make a profit off of the game but still be affordable so everyone could play the game.Rating 10/10.

The first hour and a half of playing this was really enjoyable, but then decided to see if I was able to beat the game in one sitting.I played this with my friend on co-op mode so the Days went by a bit easier than what I would think trying to beat all 100 days playing solo. For the past six hours (and only six hours as I will never touch this game again), we went through what was the most grindful game I've completed.I have unlocked all the achievements in the amount I have played. The only hard one to get is probably the FrankenBoar's Monsters achievement. I would say do this one on the first day as that would be the easiest way to get it. All the other achievements are pretty self explainatory and can be easily acquired throughout playing the game.Through the first 30 days, you can see what the rest of the 70 days will consist of, as the game tends to repeat the same monsters and pigs again and again. It reminds of a simple hack-n-slash game with repeating enemies, so this didn't bother me as much as it would to someone else. Day 100 is the most fufilling day to complete. The final level containsall the bosses together with Princess being the biggest, fattest pig ever out of the whole game and with all 3 of the giant boars at the same time.Not only was this the most hardest and intense level in the entire game, it was the best way to end the game. As earlier, I would highly recommend playing with someone else on this game, especially if you are planning to get all the achievements.There is one easter egg that caught my attention which waswhen you are inside the barn, there is an attic part of the building above with a sunshine painting on the very far end of the wall. When shot at, the farmer sings the chorus of ""Stressed Out"" by twenty one pilots. Since I'm a huge fan of the band, this really put a smile on my face.Overall 7.7/10"

The gunplay is nice, you unlock new guns and items over time, and there is more than one way to kill your enemies.The more you play, the more you'll notice how much thought went into making this game. The mechanics work well, and despite its technical shortcomings, there are many lovely ideas to keep things fun and fresh, and many little secrets to find.Oh and for the people out there, who hate the display of unnecessary animal cruelty:The game actually tells a message against that.I hugely recommend playing this with your best friends in coop, using voice!

It was on a deal, so even more dirty cheap that the normal price, so, I just jumped in.I didn't expect nothing from it when I first played, maybe a bland and cheap FPS clone of popular games, but what I find was a really fun game, that stand out, specially if you can play with friends.First,there's no story mode or nothing like, you just talk to a farmer (or shot him, your call), then go out of the barn and kill a certain number of zombie pigs. Do this over and over, day to day in-game, and then you will have to fight a boss, one of them isgiant princess pig that will literally♥♥♥♥♥♥on you. Then, after the boss fight, you repeat the diary pig killing share again and again, until the next boss.The gameplay mechanics areextremely basic, there's no advanced commands or something like, and the map can often showclipping bugswithenemies going off the limits or getting stuck in a wall, and the map is very simple, to be honest, with the only differences between levels is the time of the day.I also found some bugs- infinite loading animations, or pigs that didn't move at all. Well, nothing too much, to be honest.Sound and graphic-wise, the game is below for today standards, as anyone can see in the screenshots in the storepage, but well, I can't complain, after all, it's made to run at almost every system and I can't say that I think that is horrible or anything like. It could use some improvement, yes, but I'm okay with the graphics as they're.Then, a surprise is that the game isoften updated by the developers. They updated the game to support 3 and 4 players co-op and added more achievements, what I find pretty cool. And talking about coop, I think that this is where this game shines. You can have fun with it in single-player, yes, but even more with a friend in coop. I don't agree with the description where it said that the game boast ""over 15+ hours of gameplay"", but if you find some friends to play with it, maybe you can get even more. However, for single-player, 3, maybe 4 hours maximum until you get bored of it.So, for the price tag, even without any discount, this game is quite good, even with the flaws cited. The devs still releases updates, coop is really fun, and so is the game in general, and probably, you don't need to worry if you system will run it.REVIEW:7.5/10"

,Recommended,434570,21993124,"Posted: 22 March, 2016",all,HardDiskD,"Blood and Bacon is an arena shooter where you run around a completely absurd farm to rid it from evil pigs that have taken over it.The premise is simple: You grab your favorite pistol and main gun, shoot all the evil pigs and come back to the barn to pass the day. There is also a meat grinding mechanic where you can exchange the bits of the dead pigs for bonuses like ammo for your main gun, grenades and a couple of other powerups.While the gameplay itself is sadly not much remarkable, the absurdist elements and humor of the game is what really sets it apart, and it's what's going to really carry to game or not for you.One other major flaw of the game is that it really overstays its welcome in the ending levels. If you make it to day 20 and you either start to get bored or weren't hooked to it yet, you'll be justified in leaving.Overall, it's a quirky game that's very wekk worth its admission price if you are looking for an arena shooter."
,Recommended,434570,22173073,"Posted: 31 March, 2016",all,basically god,"I first saw this game and was skeptical of the strange graphics and strange everything really. However I had some extra pocket change from buying games and decided why not. I was certainly in for a treat.Not let me get the cons before going into the pros just to get them out of the way-The SoundsSounds is few and far between when it comes to this. Guns, voice acting and certain sounds that must be activated and one song that plays everytime a new day comes and pig noises/ splatter from the gore. So sometimes you can get hit from pigs that you wouldn't have known were there unless you used your eyes and which I have almost died many atimes from this issue. However for 60 percent of the time you will be running and gunning.  There really is no bg music but that isn't that bad as you could put some music of metal or something.-The Graphics.While yes the graphics isn't on par of that of modern games but given the price I'd say it's fine. However i'm fairly certain that a potato that was gutted would be able to run this. Which is certainly a good thing.-Replay value / Things to do.I felt these things are very similar so I put them in one. As you can probably tell it isn't a huge game by all means. I've only played two hours and almost unlocked everything in the game on day 30. While it may bring in a new enemy every week or so and have bosses there really isn't much to say about the unlocks as each are as basic and basic goes and once you unlocked all the items then it just get's a bit boring and may need breaks to get to the high plains. As I Said im perhaps a quarter through and I have almost all the unlocks.Things to do is once again few and far between. There are several options to kill the boars and use them for personal gain. First is probably going to be the most used is the grinder. The grinder is essentually you currency. The way it works is if you kill a boar you can shove it's body by melee or by running over it if it exploded in peices. It will grind the peices and suck in anynear by giblets that were once the pigs. The grinded meat can be used to make items such as ammo. In which I will go on about it in my positive side. But for now you get the concept.Next is the electric fence. This is probably going to be your least used. The Electric fence is a fence that is posted in a circle in the middle of the map and can be activated by a switch on a wall of a small shack. This basically makes it so anything that is in the circle and or in the rims of the electricity will be made into bacon. The good thing is that it is good to killing a group of boars but it will turn into a statue of ash and will break apart when touched. When using the fence you cannot use the remains of the boar for items like ammo as it needs blood to charge. I usually use it once a game a day and never touch it again. Also. The skeleton boars aren't affected by the fence. cos you know....They dont have flesh.The water pumpThe water pump is your only source of health and is limited to the amount of uses it can have. So using it when you most need it is vital. However there are two pumps. If one runs out then another can be used but be warned once you use it up you cannot heal any longer.You might be thinking Is that all? Yes. yes it is. This game is very, very, very small but I can see that future improvements could be made.Now on to the pros.- Gameplay.This game is♥♥♥♥♥♥stinkingly fun. I never knew how fun it could be shooting pigs and boars before untill I played this. While it is very small it is very fun on it's own. Bringing in silly bosses, mini bosses and strange boars and pigs that you may have never thought could be a thing until now. I love it.-Grinder RewardsAs explained flesh apeases the machine and gives you items for slaying and inserting the flesh of the pigs and boars.But it gives more that just that.Grenades are the second unlock you get from this and dosen't take much to get it. However it is equally the most useless out of the rest of them as the rest as some passive or gives ammo. However the grenade can be used to cook (If you ever played cod or really any game with grenades where you can hold them to wait the timers) to get a better chance on hitting your target but in my opinion it is one of the worst items on there.Boars milk is basically a speed boost which can be awesome at times and makes it easier to dodge targets like minibosses.I forgot the names of the rest but there are stuff that makes melee damage basically insta kill non boss characters and ect.-The story.The story is quite funny and makes no sense but because game.The story goes like this. There is a farmer who has been betrayed by his pigs and boars as they pinned him by the wall by pitchfork and knawed off his left foot. So he wants to get revenge by supplying you with weapons to destroy them with.(Also shoot the guy so he talk but make sure he talks per hit so let him finish his dailog before shooting again and he will give you a suprise ;} )Co-opYes, it's a thing. Never tried it but it is certainly a thing.-Dosen't break the bankThis could easily be a 5 dollar game is it had a bit more to it. However it is only a single dollar. In this case it is worth every penny.-GunsFor god sake you are killing pigs with aks, revolvers and even paint ball guns. What isn't there to like about this?Bosses/minibossesSilly, cute and funny. The bosses can be difficult at first but can be easily defeated. However bosses take a bit more than just blap blap shoot bang. As key areas can mean more damage.- Revenge DayTired of the relentless pain the pigs have caused you? Do you just wanna slaughter the♥♥♥♥♥♥outta pigs in an over kill of a match? One day per week which is at the end of the week a thing called revenge day comes. You have infinate ammo, Explosive rounds, and insta explode anything that moves. This is great for farming blood in the grinder for (Practically) free items. Also if you shoot an exploded peice of a boar you can shoot it up in the air and juggle it by continuously shooting it and if you keep it up for a certain amount of time it will explode into fire works. This can be done easily on revenge day. You dont get much but pride on how long and how far you got it to go up before it exploded.There is more to explain but it seems if I went further than I would ramble on about how this is actually quite good for it's price.I give this game an 8/10 piggies."

You can then buy stuff like grenades, ammo or speed boost and stuff like that. It is a fun interesting little mechanic.Finally I'd tell you that they are bosses, very mean bosses but quite fun to fight against, so far their death animations blew my mind off, so gore and satisfying to see these tough guys explode into millions of pieces or simply desintegrate...I think that this is the best game you can get on steam for less than an euro, I say Yes, thumbs up"

There's a variety of crazy characters to choose from; the roster is going up with them, as well as weapons, and craftable powerups. Power ups can be made by using A Machine For Pigs (meat grinder) if you'll pardon the bad pun; you make stuff by kicking pig parts into it.This is also a survival game if you haven't guessed; it is a welcome twist on the genre to add humor. The most you could be terrified is when facing either the hordes of undead pigs, or bosses in the dark, with a flashlight. It's all good fun, but messy. :)Plus, it's possible to reload while running, and they just recently added fov settings among other things.Overall, I greatly enjoyed it, but if you have a problem with the porcine slaughter of thousands of not so innocent pigs then this is not the game for you."

You're given a (somewhat) wide selection of weapons to choose from and each day you're given a certain amount of enemies to kill and the rest of what you can do is up to you. It's amazing each day, you can experiment different ways to kill the pigs (deadly pigs). With pig parts flying all over you can move them to the grinder where you can pick up things such as ammo, boar milk, and so much more. The game also has certain challenges on some days, the boss fights are really challenging but they are really entertaining especially with some of their hilarious dialogue.The whole multiplayer experience seems great because you can grab a group of friends and participate together fighting evil pig thingies.OverallOverall, this game is pretty good and it's definitely worth the price.

Overtime, you will unlock several unique weapons and acquire comical powerups from a functional pig grinder on the farm. Although it seems straightforward at first, the variety in the games levels will always be a challenge; just as you set into a rhythm, the game throws several new enemy types upon you, forcing you to stay on your toes. The pig types include armored pigs, super fast pigs, tiny pigs, huge pigs, skeletal pigs, princess pigs, pigs that run in herds, pigs that can grow in size, and many other types that can be tricky to deal with when first encountered. Each of the game's weapons, from an uzi to a missile launcher, feel powerful and satisfying to play with. At its low price, there are very very few games on any platform that can match Blood and Bacon in value, fun, and comedy.

This game gave me hours of fun after I got passed the graphics and sound effects. This is a very gory shoot em up game with a little twist, evil pigs have taken over the farmer's land and you must kill every single one of them. The weapons are very fun to use, and the pigs have many different designs. One thing about this game though, is that the levels do repeat themselves alot, as does the speech from the farmer and the gameplay. I recomend picking up this game is it is only ust 99 cents."

The game is simple but surpringly fun and gory, body parts explode heads fly and you can knock dead pigs into the griender to earn power ups.One of the highlights of my time with the game was after slughtering a huge number of undead reducing them to chunks, knocking one peice into the grinder and watching as a wave of pig chunks flew into the air and crashed into the grinder.The game has a small variaty of guns to unlock day and night combat, and online play, co-op and a hoard mode, and recently got a free Halloween update as well. The Devs seem like good people who care about the people who play their game which is alwaysa bit rare these days. Overall I'd reccomend the game, its hard to go wrong at this price."

Not the best at FPS games, but thought what the heck. Started it up. Instantly weirded out. A bloody farmer, speared into the wall of a barn (who is somehow still alive) gives you instructions on how to massacre a horde of pigs outside. Pretty soon, we were outside shooting them down, and having a blast. This game is brutal, bloody and brilliant.

Running around and shooting the crap out of dozens of pigs is just plain fun.  Play with some friends and this game is seriously a hilarious joyride.  The voice acting is absolutely my favorite part, and everything the farmer says made my group laugh out loud many a time.  Plenty of secrets exist in the game too.  There are cool little quirks and discoveries to be made, and discovering these is another little part of the ""magic"" that this little gem exudes.TLDR;This game is $.99 not on sale and is totally worth every penny, with $4.00 you can buy it for 3 friends and have an awesome afternoon (assuming you don't keep playing it every other day like we do) of blood, guts, and BACON!"

It's a comedic survival shooter with well timed horror elements and gross-out visual puns. Most of the comedic moments are due to the (somehow alive) farmer pinned to the wall with a pitchfork. He's very deadpan and sardonic, and has a voiceline for each day (at least as far as I've played). The shooter elements work very well. You have a primary weapon with ammo management and a secondary with infinite bullets. At the start of each game, you pick your two weapons and head out to the farm.The main antagonists (and only antagonists) of this game are pigs. Boars to be exact. It's hard to tell why they're rampaging, since the plot is very light, but they seem to at least have eaten steroid-laced grain that the farmer kept in his silo (which he tells you for some reason). They can be dismembered and keep going, but ultimately you can gib them completely. This adds another gameplay elements. The gibs have physics and can be kicked, shot or melee'd around, and if you get them into a meat grinder, you can turn them into useful items like ammo, grenades and various buffs for your character. There are a variety of different pigs to kill with different variables and weaknesses.Now, for the strangely well timed horror elements. Every now and then, you have a night mission. During these missions, strangely muted and bitcrushed music plays, which is quite unsettling, and many of the pigs have been replaced with skeleton pigs. I have no idea why this freaked me out. Maybe it's the moments when you feel alone and can't find that last pig, just for it to magically appear behind you. Maybe it's the insanely creepy metal pigs when you get up close to them. I'll tell you one thing; the first boss is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing scary.I give this game an 8/10 for surprising me. It has great potential and somehow managed to work out despite how it looks and sounds. I'd wager to give this a 9, but I think it would need a little bit of extra content and gameplay polish for that.Definitely recommended."

The game is mayhem from start to finish and keeps you playing for a good while!There's progression in the form of extra weapons to use against the pigs, which is where a lot of fun comes from when you have the right loadout. Another thing to be excited for is the surprise that awaits you at each level. There's not really clear indicators of what's up next, but it's also not completely unpredictable, which makes for a good balance that can sometimes catch you off guard.Recently with the inclusion of online multiplayer, you're able to play the game with friends, and boyyy is it a real riot!

They serve their own purpose and some combinations are far, far better than others.Each of the 4 or so powerups you can obtain in the game (the rest of the obtainable items being ammo or grenades) are actually quite good and do their job well.A toaster from 1973 can run this game, even with hundreds of entities on the screen.+/-:A few miscellaneous bugs here and there such as shoving dead bodies making the enemy counter go up, or ammo counters glitching out for a couple weapons. I've yet to encounter any bugs that break the game or make general play impossible, however.The Farmer's voice acting is less-than-stellar (although this might be intentional as the game is a bit tongue-in-cheek) and the dialogue he speaks repeats from Days ~41 through 99. If you're like me and breeze through the days quite fast, it may get a little bit incredibly excessively grating.The game is still being updated by the developer (for better or worse). At the time of writing this review, the developer is currently working on 4-player co-op mode (current version is up to 2 player only)The graphics are early PS2-tier (again, for better or worse) and there are only two or three music tracks in the entire game (only one during the actual day gameplay).CONS:The final weapon you obtain (a rocket launcher than sends a rocket into the air to rain down airstrikes) is actually quite disappointing and practically unusuable. For its high blood cost at the grinder for one rocket drop and a high spread for the airstrikes, its damage is lackluster at best and almost nonexistent at worst. Even on revenge day it barely kills anything.Bosses repeat after day 20 in a predictable pattern (until day 100) with only one more boss and/or a palatte swap depending on which day is repeated. This combined with the general flow of the Days can lead to repititve gameplay, which even the almost satirical tone of the game may not be able to alleviate.As with the gameplay, the replayability may stagnate over time due to the nature of the game.CONCLUSIONFor the incredibly costly and expensive full retail price of 99 cents, you may find better or worse than this game easily. However, as I see it you would be hard-pressed to find a cheap game of cheap mindless violence more addicting and fun than this game (unless it's a flash game for free or something.) I would immediately recommend this game to anyone who is looking to spend anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 days doing something that requires nothing more than a mighty thirst for bloodshed.-I would like to point out that the developer BigCorporation has contacted me personally to thank me for supporting the game. The dev is friendly and actually listens to the feedback given to them in the discussions or otherwise. The developer's contacting me and any information given has not changed the opinions and information presented in this review in any way."

Graphics are look dated but are passable if you are someone that doesn't care about the way the game looks. Anyone that has Played old Valve games (such as Counter Strike Left 4 Dead 1 or Half Life 1) will somewhat feel right at home. This game looks like the Dollar it is worth. The shooting is really good but nothing really new. Guns are somewhat transparent but I am pretty sure the guys wanted it to look that way.The few bad things about this game are that the Electrical fence is pretty much useless. The Meat Grinder is a way for you to get Ammo, Grenades, exc. The way to go about this is to kill most of the pigs near the machiene and shoot some of the chunks of meat into the Grinder to get the Machiene started and most of the chunks will start to flow in and the more chunks go in the more rewards you are able to get. But Their is no way you will be able to collect while their are still enemies alive becauset they Knock you all around to where you can barily shoot with acuracy. The times it is Nighttime is really not all that different to the Daytime only black sky and the colors are dimmed down a little.Now this isnt a game that you will be skipping your Homework to play. It's a game that you will play if you have twenty or thirdy minutes to pass and you have nothing else to play. It could be more enjoyable if you have a friend with a copy but I have no friends with a copy of the game so I couldn't see for myself. I cant really see myself recommending it to anyone since Left 4 Dead 2 exist and i can't really see me playing this daily or weekly.

,Recommended,434570,21262999,"Posted: 16 February, 2016",all,|-MC_JP-|THE LEGACY OF TERROR,"Before I start I wanna say big thanks to the developer ""BigCorporation"" for taking 2 hours of his personall time in order to fully get the game working for me. A great step by step plan to figure out what was wrong and he knows what he is doing! The developer is a friendly person who cares about his game and it's players!so now my sort of In depth review of Blood and bacon.Where do I start? You play as a own chosen character who needs to survive in a farm attacked by evil piggies. Lucky the character isn't named ""angry bird"" haha! Jokes aside this game is just straight fun and stress relieving.  The game is an arena shooter that puts you against various pigs or better boars. Tiny, normal, big, undead, bones etc.-Weapons-The game has 4 Handguns and 7 main weapons. Ranging from Ak's and Uzis to pistols and grenade launchers. Power ups are present like hand grenades and melee boosters.-Area-As stated the game sets place on a ""deserted"" farm, well deserted is a big word since waves and waves of bacon ready yummy pigs are coming your way and the farmer which is impaled with a pitchfork. He adds a great humor to the game aswell. The farm has a few interesting spots. The grinder allows you to dump the corpses in the bacon o fier and this will give you handy pickups later in the game. The electric fence gives a great killzone in the middle of the map, the farmhouse is the place for weapons and missions, and you can heal with a waterwell.-special events-Ingame: every week has 1 revenge day. This day gives you infinite explosive ammo, ideal for filling the grinder. On the 10th day there will be a boss fight, with various funny bosses.Night battles are scary because of the limited light you have. Adding into the suspense.Every mission is a day and can last from 30 seconds to 10 minutes or more (mostly boss battles do take some time) So this is a great short take a break game.Pros:+ Great stress relieving shoot-em up area shooter+ Handy for playing in short breaks (lunch break, or a little stress reliever trough the day)+ Cheaper than a pack of chewing gum+ The developer is a great person who took 2 hours of his personal time to aid me in my problem. Running through all the scenarios and fixing the problem we had.+ Shoot pigs ask questions later+ Environmental attacks adds into the imersion+ Great oldschool simple shoot em up game.Cons:- Sadly no multiplayer yet. Would have been awesome- Could be a bit repetitive for some people because of limited content (please do note that this is a 99 cent game and not a 60$ huge budget title)Overall score: 8/10.---original notes----Reworked my review after the developer contacted me. After working all night to get the problem fixed I must say the dev is working hard to help everyone. And besides, I love this slaughter game. So thumbs up!"

The bosses are hilarious talking boars and a Pig that has some peculiar talents further in make this game worth the small price.Graphically its nothing spectacular, but its not all about visuals in gaming its about the experience, and this game is definately a experience you wont forget anytime soon.The voice acting was something i complained about in my original review, but again after speaking to the Dev he explained the original voice actor caused issues and he had to change all the vocals (using his own voice), which now i think about it and know about it adds character and a more personal touch for the Dev on his own game.The Dev comes across as a very caring person who respects the opinions of the players and also has a passion for his creation. He also likes Coffee :PI look forward to seeing more from this dev, and to see how this game progresses.Your a credit to the gaming industry, keep up the hard work.P.S.

,Recommended,434570,24402735,"Posted: 18 July, 2016",all,Bedhead Bernie,"Blood and Bacon is by far the greatest game I have ever played. The game's steep price may cause some gamer-gators to stray away from the game, but trust me, it is WORTH every single penny. The first thing I love about this game is it's unique art style. You look at most popular, mainstream first-person shooters and you get the same, boring, mundane, and downright smelly bullcrap. Well, this is not the case with Blood and Bacon. It's unique setting of some kind of rural area makes for an amazing experience. It is like I'm ACTUALLY THERE, and that is not something I can say for 'brown gun warfare'. Another aspect I love in the game is the quirkiness, and the sense of a deeper lore. The game has such a ♥♥♥♥ing AMAZING sense of humor. The farmer is very likeable, and I give my infinite praise to whoever the voice actor. I won't spoil anything, but if you find some really well hidden easter eggs, you're going to be scratching your head trying to figure out the developer's clues and secrets. The soundtrack to this game is groundbreaking. Yes, it's a bit primitive, but that's what I love about it. It KNOWS what it wants to be, and isn't some awful, confused instrumental! Sure, you may have heard it somewhere, but if it ain't broke, don't fix it! The weapons are so well balanced, and the pigs are challenging, yet fair. (Unlike Left 4 Dead 2, Valve's very awful spiritual predeccesor.) I give Blood and Bacon a perfect 10 / 10."

Sometimes I wonder, however, where does my blood and bacon come from? When I asked my local bacon farmer where bacon actually comes from he simply stated, ""From the shop, of course!""As you can imagine, I wasn't particularly satisfied with the answer so I decided it was time to consult Steam. That was when I happened upon a [great co-operative, massively fun and totally entertaining] game known as Blood and Bacon. Within the game I learned where it was that the blood and bacon that adorns my table every morning at breakfast actually comes from. I also learned of the methods used to acquire said blood and bacon as the game allows you to play as one of the skeletons or undead vikings who go out onto their ranches every day for 101 days after getting their briefing from their wall mounted ranch owner. Such methods include, but are not limited to:• Assault Rifles• Paintball Gun• Uzi• Silenced PistolI highly recommend that you purchase this highly educational game and help yourself better understand where it is that we get our ever loved Blood and Bacon."

Not recommended for vegans.TitleBlood and BaconDeveloperBig CorporationPublisherGrunge Games LTDRelease1 February 2016Graphics3DGenreFPSPrice€0,99Rating7/10The game.Blood and Baconis a highly stylized team-based shooter game. This game is an antibiotic for what ails indie FPS's. No half-baked concoction, no stiff controls, no detrimentally-repetitive waves, and perhaps most importantly, no zombies. Well, no traditional zombies. Instead it’s undead livestock, refreshing enough to feel different, and dead enough not to upset animal rights groups.The plot (+):starting off in the game, you are a police officer going to a barn over some mysterious activity, once you arrive at the barn you find the farmer nailed to the wall as he says it was the pigs that is making the farm a bad place. It's your job to survive wave after wave of evil pigs to bring peace back to the farm.Gameplay.The barn is the hub where you talk to the farmer every day, you will also see weapons on the walls to use against the pigs, and unlock more weapons as the days progress. You leave the barn to fight a huge horde of pigs - the best part aboutBlood and Baconis blowing them to pieces before they attack you. This game makes it a beautiful sight having pig guts fly all around the map, and you’re able to punch the dead pigs into a grinder to give you ammo, grenades, or even milk. Along with this game being a horde mode, many days will be different from how you play. Some of the days can either be at night, which brings out skeleton pigs, days with unlimited ammo, or days having you fight bosses.The graphics (+):they are old-looking, but in my opinion kinda charming. The ak-47 looks like something taken out of theCounter-Strike 1.6era, but the game plays like a fast-paced, crazy FPS. They was obviously made this was to be more of a humorous type of game.The story (-):doesn't make much sense and the voice-acting is a little bad, but who cares. This is a game mostly focused on silly gameplay where you murder hordes of monsters and animals for a while. This game actually had more depth then I expected for the price, lots of characters to pick between, some sort of upgrade system, new unlockable levels, cheat mode enabled once you clear thirty waves, and so on.Multiplayer.One amazing thing about this game is the multiplayer mode; you are able to fight pigs not just by yourself, but with people around the world, who you meet to kill endless waves of pigs to paint the farm red with pig blood.If you just want a little bit of fun alone or with friends (co-op) then by all means pick this up.Just don't expect to much in terms of graphics or story.Blood and Bacondoes have 100+ levels though, so gameplay-wise it actually have a lot of content for the asking price.Positive points. (+)Price.I'm not vegan, what's obviously important.The game need minimum requirements for PC.Wise and easy gameplay.Old graphics but very kind.Multiplayer makes this game a lot of fun (up to 6 players).Negative points. (-)Repetitive scenes.The story is weak (but does it matter?).A very small soundtrack.For a cheap horde mode game, it can be argued as the best horde game. While most games are going for €5, this game boasts free DLC and updates for a while, and it was a successful port from xbox360.Blood and Baconis an outstanding game to go back to from time to time, and you can play it in short bursts showing that you do not need to buy the most expensive and beautiful looking games to have a blast.Blood and Baconis a game that is recommended to have in your steam library due to how much fun can be had, for such a cheap deal."

And for the price you can get it at both on and off sale, the TLDR is: It's worth it.B&B very much feels like a low budget/gamedesignstudent'scapstoneproject game but if you can get past that, it's pretty fun. Gameplay wise, the game is a CoD Zombies esc sort of round survival game. However, instead of zombies there are mutant pigs and instead of an abandoned nazi base your on a farm. Also, instead of a ghostly announcer, you have the farm's owner pinned the wall by a pitchfork. There is a variety of weapons, characters, bosses, and in-game power ups and with large scale co-op B&B can be a blast. 10/10."

However this last update is not like them... it completely changes everything, to add so much new things in one time it's so unbalanced and with the tree skill every hero is different now the supports are carries and the carries supports it's like i have no knowledge of the game.About the visuals. The new HUD is really small (keep in mind many people play on standart laptops size 15.6"") and the health bar is hard to watch when it's on the bottom instead on top of the skill bar. It will really be good if after all the changes you get the option to adjust all of those (for example to expand the HUD like the map size)."

You kill hordes of pigs and try to survive the day, preferably with your friends.You get a sense of progression through weapon and item unlocks, achievements and learning the weaknesses of your enemies. In conclusion Blood and Bacon offers solid game design. It is defnitly lacking in the graphics department, which doesn't bother me a bit. Like all wave based shooters, Blood and Bacon suffers from repetition, but it takes some time before it gets boring. It introduces new special enemies/bosses and there's constantly something happening on the screen (gibs, explosions, etc). Sadly, I have to recommend it!"

It is definitely worth more than what I paid for it and it is definitely worth more than the current store price which is $1.09. While graphically it isn't ground breaking or up to today's standards the game is awesome. The farmer is so stupid/simple with his dialogue you can't help but laugh. Also in regards to the boss I fought just WOW!  It really is nice to get a shooter that is different and this definitely is different. It is a nice change from playing CODs, BFs and similar. I like the fact also that there are different ways to kill things and things you must do a certain way to kill things.  In terms of modes there is single player and coop plus different difficulty levels giving it replay value for sure. I also have to say this would be a nice game to bring out at Halloween every single year for sure. This also is a game that is an easy pick up and play.

,Recommended,434570,28264879,"Posted: 8 December, 2016",all,снорра,"Blood and Bacon is a ""unique"" expirience. When I say ""unique"" I say ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and repetitive. The bases itself in killing waves of pigs. That's it. There are some bosses but the expirience itself is complete in the first minute. The bosses are gross and literally just a drag, and you will find yourself taking off your headset or turning off your sound multiple times, since the narrator, which probably is also the programmer considering how low budget this game really is, is very annoying, and he also dubs the bosses. Also I want to point out that one of the bosses, Princess, has a very detailed ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I was forced to look at when it litterally♥♥♥♥♥♥on my face and left marks of dropping in my screen and left me and my friends traumatized for life from the inside as one of us literally vomitted our guts out.You will find yourself spawning in a barn with a legless individual stuck in the wall with a trident. He will often make bad jokes, not pay you, and talk to you literally every round. You can shoot him in the balls, and in the face, which will eventually trigger grenades dropping from his leg, probably, I don't know. This game is♥♥♥♥♥♥I will ask of you, reader, one thing. Buy this game, experience it for yourself, vomit the hell out, and help me to fund a assassin to kill the makers of this masterpiece. Later then you can peacefully end the suffering. I suppose a bullet to the head is peaceful in it's own right.Also, the over use of the word ""literally"" in this review is not an over statement, this game will surprise you.EDIT of 12/12/2016:The game is actually a enjoyable experience overall. For it's low price, it's worth to get a group of friends together to jump in and enjoy the game, if you enjoy horde mode. The game gets predicable, but not necessarily not fun, it's actually a lot of fun as you unlock new guns and even some cosmetics. There are also some achievements that should keep any completionist out there entertained for a while.And if you didn't get this review, everything before the edit is a joke. Don't let my jokes get you away from this game. Give it a try, and if you didn't enjoy it at the end you could always charge it back.

Not only does it pack a variety of weapons you can earn from advancing to each level but it's humor (the one voice actor) makes the game all the more enjoyable. This game is challenging at points, even on Normal Mode. The gameplay consists sort of like COD ZOMBIES where you defeat horde after horde of Pig and advance to the next level. At every tenth level, there's a boss fight in which you must avoid their disgusting gastric juices to beat them. The game is probably at it's best when playing with multiple people but I found single-player to be just as great. I give Blood and Bacon a 9/10 for it's humor and it's mechanics and variety."

Yes. You will get a couple hours of fun for $1. Could get even more time on it if you get a friend to play it with you.Why? The game is a mindless shooter, so you can go ahead and shoot like crazy at all the boars that are chasing you. Graphics are like a mediocre version of Postal 2, there's 1 level,  a few different boar types, 2 different bosses, 6 primary  and 4 secondary weapons, 100 couple minute days to get to the 'ending', and a guy that repeats a set of comments and cheap puns. Again, this is fun for a bit, which makes it worth the $1.Rating purely based on quality: 4/10Rating based on quality for price: 7/10(This is my opinion, by the way.

I played it single player for the most part and found the gameplay to be fast paced and satisfying.However it does get repetitive after a while, as you'll need go through 100 levels in order to beat the game and honestly the novelty will likely wear thin after about 30 levels or so.  Especially since there are ""10"" boss battles over the course of the game, but really after day 20 the bosses are literally just copy pastes of the first two bosses.In the end though, this game is literally cheaper than a snickers bar and will provide at least an hour or two of entertainment.

So here is full review from me.Pros:- Fun multiplayer- Up to 4 people multiplayer- Very cheap- Has jokes sprinkled here and there- Nice ammount of weapons to use, adds diversity inwhat you can/can't do and changes your playstyle quite a bit on which weapons to choose- It's in its early build stage and has a lot of room to grow- Difficult (not like dark souls difficult but difficult in the sense that the boss fights- different characters to play asCons:- Crashes every once in a while- The game is in early build (It can be a good and bad thing, bad in the sense that it is still kind of broken and has a limited amount of content)- Repetitive gameplay- Said repetitive gameplay goes on for 100 levels.- All boss fights are re textures or just multiple of the last boss fight- Boring single player- odd animationsRecomendations to the dev: (I know you will see this)- All in all this game is pretty good in multiplayer, but single player could use some tweaks to make the game more fun for the indivisual.- Give different characters different traits. Like make certain characters move faster but are squishy, make characters more tanky but slower, Higher reload speeds ect.Over all:This game is very fun and is very cheap for what it gives you gameplay wise. It is a very fun multi player game but fails in it's single player department. So if you don't have friends who are willing to play this game with you then you might not want to get this game. Aside from that the game has a lot of room to grow so this may not be the last review I give it.I give this build of the game a 7.5/10 Eyyyy that's pretty good"

I honestly thought about refunding it because I know at some point the joke will wear thin.  Then I remember the time I bought Dinosaur Hunt for 99 cents.Only to swiftly refund Dinosaur hunt in less than an hour. When compared to Dinosaur Hunt, Blood and Bacon is a masterpiece. It’s rare that I delve into the 99 cent bargain bin,  this would be my third dip in the pool. Behind Dinosaur Hunt and Street Racing Syndicate.I picked up Street Racing Syndicate on sale for 99 cents and I kept it. It’s likely I’m going to keep Blood and Bacon as well.  Because it’s fun and unlike other games in its price bracket it actually delivers everything it promises by the bucket load.It looks like a Left 4 Dead clone at surface level. It plays like an odd mix of Killing Floor and Serious Sam with lots of blood and lots of bacon.  It’s the whole hog and it more than lives up to its title of the goriest indie game ever.It runs smooth, and I’m confident it could even run on a toaster with no lag.  The option of multiple camera angles to suit multiple styles of play is quite a neat little feature though I couldn’t see myself playing B&B in anything but first person.If I had 5 other people to play with I’d gift them 10 copies. It’s just that good. B&B is the real haram.  The game was released in 2016 but it looks more like a 2008 game.  It’s got multiplayer, online multiplayer and co-op which is awesome.Getting the resolution to fit the screen right was a bit fiddly but after some optimization the game runs smoothly at a crispy 60FPS without any lag.  Makes me weirdly reminiscent about that movie “Razorback’ and if you’ve seen it you’ll understand why.I don’t know… there’s something about blasting the **** out of a razorback that brightens up my whole day. Godless **** eating vermin.  B&B only fails insofar as it doesn’t appear to have a steam workshop or any mods, which is a massive albeit liveable shame.On some level I can’t help but feel the game would have been better suited to lambs, goats, emus, walruses… the possibilities for mods are endless.  The day/night cycle is a nice touch and damn am I glad they gave you a way to heal in single player.The choice of playable characters is pretty hilarious, stereotypical and borders on the edges of racist and absurd.  Johnny Blood in particular. There’s no conceivable way I will get to the 100th way by myself, even on the easiest difficulty and I’m fine with that.The meat grinder is an interesting mechanic though if I’m supposed to kick meat into the grinder and the developer of the game forget to even map a kick button then that’s not my problem and it honestly should’ve been patched by now.Weapon variety is basic although perfectly serviceable, even if I still haven’t gotten the hang of the electric fence.There are a variety of 13 enemies, 12 bosses and 1 secret boss scattered throughout 100+ levels and the game accommodates between 2-6 players I’m told.It’s a fun weekend distraction for you and a few friends for less than the combined total of a cup of coffee with serviceable weapons, a variety of enemies with zero lag and maximum challenge.  From where I’m sitting, its hog heaven!"

It delivers both copious amounts of blood and tons of bacon. Its not very long but has a nice sense of humour to it, even the EULA has jokes in it. For the price I'd say its a bargain. Though you should play it with friends. Because the latter half of the game feels like a copy paste of the first. And there is little boss variety.If your looking for a few hours to kill with your friends Blood and Bacon is the game for you."

It's no Doom or anything, but for the money you'll find a pretty decent game here. From the endless barage of enemies (actually of varying types too, as the game progresses) to the dialogue of the farmer when you do inane things like shoot his crotch or shine the flashlight in his eyes, there's something for everyone! Okay, not really for everyone, but still...I was surprised to check the multiplayer lobbies at 1AM on a Monday morning and see a fair amount of games going so that's definitely a plus as Blood and Bacon is one of those games better enjoyed with strangers. The gameplay is competent though there isn't much to it, graphics are mediocre, and there are a few non-game-breaking bugs but from a small team for a buck, this game is more than what I'd expect. Overall, enjoyable if forgettable in the short-term; worth $1 to me but wouldn't be worth $5 if it were priced as such."

For example neuf wars, castle minder z, and murder miner.Lets get into the pros of this game.pro's: uses pigs instead of zombies and mixes it up a little bit.-epic name- A cool guy that looks like blacks ops 2 leroy I think is his name.-tries to mix things up a little.- a large amout of weapons.- bosses like every 10 days or rounds.- uses water to heal because why the ♥♥♥♥ not.- a dollor.NOTE: these are just a few pros as I have not played the full game yet.Cons: The sounds in the games are not pleasents to my ears.-bad voice acting. (sorry dude)- No new places to explore (rember only played 30 mins so don't know if this is really the case.Honesty there might be more but that is all I can think of for now and that is a good thing.

You know, primary weapons with limited ammo and secondary ones with unlimited ammo.It's pretty cheap too, so that's a plus.There's a lot of slightly immature humor, if that's your kind of thing. Not only does the game consider ""butt shots"" better than headshots, but there's a boss dedicated to coating you in fecal matter and vomit. But hey, like it says up there, if you're into that, that'll be funny and all.I'd give this game a 9/10. While there are some aspects to the game that aren't explained (such as the hats) or don't make sense (such as having infinite stamina for running with little to no downsides), Blood and Bacon is a great time waster.False advertizing, though.

But it's the simplicity of this game that makes it such a gem. The graphics aren't SUPER HD MEGA AMAZING because it's supposed to just be simple. These are the kinds of games that no one hears about, but once they play it, they can't stop. I have loved every second of it from the hilarious farmer to the insanely grotesque bosses. I had run into a slight problem with the resolution, so I posted it into the discussion section, later to realize how to fix it so I promptly deleted it. A little while later, I notice a new comment on my feed. It was the dev account BigCorporation confirming if I had fixed my problem. This is true dedication to the fan base right here. Sure it was a simple confirmation, but most devs would have just brushed it off like it was nothing. Every post I've seen in the discussion for this game has had a response straight from BigCorporation. This is showing that they care a lot about the happiness of there fans and aren't just in it for the money.

This game is a joke, but it is a ""bloody"" good one!*No Spoilers*Pros:-Good gameplay.-Performance is acceptable.-Slaughtering pigs is actually very fun, even if you are a vegan.-The game is surprisingly funny and humorous.-The interactions between the farmer are hilarious, but it gets old very fast when he starts repeating his dialogue.-The bosses are pretty much the same. The difficulty goes up and so does the ridiculousness of the game.Mixed Feelings:-The music is annoying especially in the night missions. But not much can be expected from such a game.-The graphics are for the blood are awesome, but the rest of the game is low-res.Cons:-The game becomes extremely repetitive after a while. Once you unlock all of the weapons, there is not much to do. The pigs and the bosses are similar and the game becomes a grind to reach day 100. I could not force myself to continue after day 46 (Valiant effort though!)Final Verdict:Blood and Bacon was a pleasant surprise for me, as I didn't expect anything from it. I enjoyed killing thousands of pigs, but I could not do it for more than 2.5 hours. This game is very cheap and you would get a couple good laughs. I will give Blood and Bacon, a 7/10"

Definitely worth the buy for 79 pence.For the gameplay, it's fairly simple: shoot pigs until the day ends then talk to the farmer and start the next day. A lot of the rounds are very similar (though that shouldn't be a problem if you've ever played COD zombies) apart from the two boss fights  which reappear with elevated difficulty every tenth day. There are differents difficulty levels and achievements to keep the game interesting for most of your play time and, if it's your thing, there's a paint gun to draw♥♥♥♥♥♥♥with.The graphics are basically basically the same as you see on the previews so pretty much any computer should be able to run this game with 30+ fps.TL;DR: Good game for price.

The gameitselfdoes not scare me, but some of the models, however, do.A model that has perturbed me over and over again is the farmer's model. I'm not talking about the farmer you talk to at the start and end of every level, no, I'm talking about the unlockable player's model. You can play as the farmer later in the game. The face of the model gives me chills everytime I look at it. The face is void of emotion, but manages to be threatening. The eyes are blank, and paired with an ajar mouth to boot. The mouth has a top layer of teeth, but no bottom layer to be found. The face always instills perturbation into me. This face haunts me.Besides that, it is a pretty fun game :)"

76561198001940736,Recommended,434570,28042846,"Posted: 29 November, 2016",all,His_Awesomeness,"IntroductionBlood and Bacon is a lighthearted single player or cooperative first/third person shooter set on a farm with zombie pigs. The gameplay is similar to Killing Floor, Left 4 Dead, and Serious Sam. The goal of the default game mode is to survive increasingly difficult waves of enemies each level. The levels vary by enemy type, ultra violent bonus revenge rounds, and occasional boss battles. The ultimate goal of the game is to purge the farm of undead pigs while unlocking new weapons, hats, and characters.Pros-101 levels of increasing difficulty-Various unlockable weapons, powerups, and cheat options-Steam achievements/Trading Cards-Excellent controller support-Free content updates by developer-Easter eggs and other secrets-Creative over the top gore-High entertainment to price ratioCons-Only one map-Charming, but dated graphics-Repetitive enemy types and bosses-Normal difficulty might not be challenging for some playersConclusionThis game is a fantastic value at $0.99 and I highly recommend it to anybody who enjoys games like Killing Floor or any FPS featuring hundreds of enemies. Blood and Bacon offers a lot of entertainment for the price of admission, but don't expect next generation graphics or a fully developed storyline. It costs less than a weapon skin from games like that and it's already more entertaining than a similarly priced candy bar."

The games plot is very indepth and the story is butt-clenching. This thrilling, beautiful, awe-inspiring game should be a national supported game on all computers instead of boring solitare.  When i was just a little boy, this game carried me through highschool as bullies could not reach me while i was playing this awesome game.

You get a selection of guns at the start of the game, a simple character select and can unlock secret hats to put on them. After the wave ends you can grind the pigs' meat to stock up on ammo, grenades or buffs to speed you up or make you buff as ♥♥♥♥.

,Recommended,434570,30998363,Posted: 7 April,all,QuantumEffect92,"TL;DR The best 99¢ you will ever spend.Pros:- Cheap to the point that I think the developers are living in cardboard boxes.- Amazing amount of content for said price.- Co-op is amazing with up to 4 people.- Have a potato computer? No need to worry. I can almost guarantee it can run this.-The very existance of this game probably make PETA enraged.Cons:- Repetitive. Very, very repetitive.- Not much replay value.- Not as fun in singleplayer as it is in co-opNotable things about game:- Blood, guts, vomit, feces... this game has it all.- A rather funny feature may happen if you throw grenade too close to yourself. There is a chance that if you are caught in the blast it will blow your arms off rendering you unable to use weapons and the only thing that happens whn you press the fire button is you'll just squirt blood out of your arm stumps all over the place. Oh, and you also slowly bleed to death. This only remedies itself once a new round begins.- The last level is hell on earth."

I overfeed her but she deserves it. She's the best pig I've ever seen. Make sure to water your crops and only buy the best fertilizer too. The graphics and weather cycles are really next-gen too, I usually start a campfire and watch the sunset while I rub Princess Blubbergut's big fat belly.

At 1st, it would not run AT ALL. But how's this? This is what I call 'Customer Service x100"".As soon as I mentioned that the game wasn't running on my setup in the forums, 'BigCorporation' (the creator of BnB) went and added me as a friend and we trully worked together fixing this problem I had.My original post was . . .Why do I keep getting...No Suitible graphics card found.I have 2x Nvidia Quadro FX 4500 n keep being told""Could not find a Direct3D device that supports the XNA Framework HiDef profile.""I'm lost here. This feels like crap. Not the game (Thanks Jim Sterling), but something ain't working right.Help please?I told 'Big C' that I also had an AMD Radeon HD 5450 still in the box. A friend of mine needed a 3d graphics card, n I found that one. They were going for $40AU delivered, so I said, get 2. I want one, that's a good deal. It had been in the box for almost 2 years - Untill my BnB error.I was reluctant to swap the cards over as it trully was the only game that had errors with my setup, but I also liked what Jim Sterling had shown me. So today I swapped them out, and I'm so happy with the result.Obviously it fived the game problem, but best of all, Everything else seams to be fine.The main thing I want to get across though, Is how good 'Big C' was with me personally. I feel we've become friends through this experience, and he is a prime example of 'The right way to DO Steam', and 'The Greenlight Process'.Oh, and I just got the game going in time for the leaderboards to be up, and while playing, 'Big C' sent me a message saying ""Damn You just got most pigs grinded"". That was good, and felt great.Thanks 'Big C' for a Kick♥♥♥♥♥game. But more importantly, thanks for your help, and thank you so very much for doing the whole Greenlight Proccess RIGHT.GG, Peeps. GG."

,Recommended,434570,32831117,Posted: 26 June,all,Reamees the Red,"By far the best game on Steam at the time of writing. A gripping storyline, flawless voice acting and infinite replay value.The protagonists attempt to survive in a dystopian society, where a mysterious seemingly immortal figure known only as The Farmer holds them hostage at Ground Zero of a biology experiment gone wrong. This experiment, presumably performed by The Farmer, has created a race of super Suidae, which now run rampant at The Farm.One of many theories to explain how all of this came to be, is that the game is biblical in nature. The Farmer represents the son of god himself. He is the shepherd and our heroes are His flock. This is made obvious by the way The Farmer is visually represented - impaled to the wall of a barn. This is a clear reference to the crucifixion of christ and as He was born in a barn, it also serves as a symbol of rebirth. This explains the borderline divine abilities of The Farmer: He survives for months, despite being impaled to a wall with a pitchfork. He can open and close doors with his mind. He can conjure up weapons and ammo. He is impervious to both bullets and explosives. He sees and knows everything that happens on The Farm.It is theorised that the protagonists are undergoing purification in purgatory. They seek to eradicate their sins, which are represented by the swine, with help from their lord and saviour The Farmer. There are certain collectibles in the game, which can only be reached by dying to the swine. This means that The Farmer rewards martyrdom. We must learn from these brave warriors and seek to rid ourselves of sin in their wake. This game has shown me the way through the valley of darkness and helped me see the light. It is never too late to embrace the guidance of The Farmer. We must repent.10/10 found Jesus via pig killing game"

I then proceeded to purchase another 5 copies because my friends pressured me into it and I'm easily impressionable. Also, I didn't know where to waste my money after I stopped playing Counter Strike. Anyhow, I'd say that considering what Blood and Bacon offers, the pricetag is pretty much a steal.I dig:-It's like 1 dollar.-Blood.-Bacon.-Blood AND Bacon.-Outrageously fun with friends.-2 pretty cool game modes.-Good amount of weapons and itens.-You can ride Princess.-Farmer's name is Blurry Face and he cares about what you think.-You can be a skeleton.-You can find a key hidden inside a hill that unlocks a WWII Helmut for said skeleton.-Poorly Photoshopped Left4Dead hud icons.-Devs are lovely people who like my idiotic screenshots.-It's not Counter Strike.I don't dig:-I'd say the game looks kinda awful. But then again, that works to its benefit in a weird way, I guess. I find it almost charming, really, but I can see how that could be a turn off for some.-I was actually surprised to find that there's no Community Workshop content for this. I don't know if there's any plans of an eventual integration, but it seems like a no brainer to me.-Gets kinda repetitive after a while.Overall, for what it is, I'd give this a solid 8/10 and rightfully grant it the""I can't believe it's not♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; Award™"

I don't mind blood and violence in video games if well utilized, but here it just seems mindless; hold the mouse down until there's lots of red and everything's dead. That's it.

Blood and Bacon was the best game I've seen for its price for a very long time, especially when playing with friends (which sadly I do not have)You are in barn with its farmer stuck to the barn wall with a pitchfork in him and a leg chopped off (no biggy). And each day you have to try and kill the required amount of boars/pigs by shooting them, juggling them and then shooting them, electrocuting them or throwing them into a mincer. Each day, more and more boars show upAfter a certain amount of days, a boos boar shows up where you shoot the living hell out of it. This happens every day in the game. The game can get boring and repetitive after a while of playing in solo, however, the game is extremely fun to play with your friends in co-op (which sadly I do not have any friends)You can play online co-op with other people, but some of the players are so brain dead that they stay in the barn and the level doesn't play or they die too quicklyBlood and Bacon is really fun game to play. So badly made that it is good. The game surprisingly has full of good humor with some challenging and difficult levels and although the game is horribly made (in terms of graphics, A.I. and gameplay), the game is ridiculously cheap for only 0.99 EUR without any sales. With sales, this game can go as cheap as 0.74 EUR (that's how much I paid for this game)However, Blood and Bacon's graphics are not that great. Some graphics are ugly to look at and the UI is pretty ugly to look at and the game offers a very small soundtrack. Not that much music happening while playing which is a shameI wouldn't recommend Blood and Bacon if it was priced higher than 1 EUR, however for the price it is offering and the options the game offers and the bloody gory fun you can have while playing alone and especially with friends, I would definitely recommend Blood and Bacon to anyoneRECOMMENDED :)NOMINATED FORTHE ""BEST USE OF A FARM ANIMAL"" AWARDFOR THE STEAM AWARDS 2016"

,Recommended,434570,21577998,"Posted: 1 March, 2016",all,ExiledAlchemist,"After completing the game I knew I just had to come back and edit my review. Don't worry this updated review is going the be spoiler free.I got this game after seeing not only the video, the price, but also the number of positive reviews.After playing it for a short time I became hooked. I just had to play this game to the end and I did. Blood and Bacon is an addictive and fun arena style wave shooter. You play as a hired gun with one job at hand to rid the farm of an army of undead hogs.  As you progress new weapons and items unlock, and at the same time enemies get bigger, stronger, and grow in number. After so many days you will encounter a boss battle. Each boss battle becomes more intense and challenging making victory feel more rewarding. With the number of options from all the unlockables players are able to come up with various combinations of how to handle each day.As for story it stays very simple and instead focuses more on the gameplay. That isn't a bad thing if you are a fan of games like Doom, or Serious Sam. The music is very catchy and really gets you in the mood to play. The graphics are closer to classic shooter style from the N64/PS2 era that just fits the theme of the game so well. In honestly it's more of a breath of fresh air compared to other modern games. The game has an art style that I haven't seen since Conker's Bad Fur Day. In all honestly it's just another reason why I enjoy this game so much.After all that said I still highly recommend this game. It's not only addictive but also a great time killer. So if you have the shekels to spare please pick it up. You can't go wrong with this one."

The days get progressively more difficult and you slowly upgrade your weapon arsenal with different traits and characteristics. The boss fights are amusing and intense. In conclusion this game is easily worth $0.99 and is one of the best indie games that i have ever played. 8/10

Elsweyr... (YYYEEEAHHHHHHH!!!!!)**BUT!** If you looking for mindless fun... For 99 cents... It's hord not to recommend this. There is far worse you can end up with for that price (not talking about sales). And even get lesser quality indie games for far more than 99 cents.So how this game works? Simpe... You have 100 days. Every day you go out and shoot them evil piggies. Oh and there is farmer... Nailed to the wall with pitchfork... And to make your situation look more Sirius (Ha...) he has no leg too. And if you are not too critical about stuff he is kinda funny. Oh and there is different pig enemies and some bosses too (I hate you, Princess...)That's pretty much all you need to know, if that sounds fine to you, go right ahead, theres lot of fun to be had. In short, that's best 99 cents I have ever spend. It's beter than buying cheeseburger...End best part is, devs of the game actually care about this game, they not just shoveled to us and left there. They making updates for it, I heard they added some content and as I understand they plan on adding something more.So yeah... What Im trying to say with all this... It's 99 cents..."

Heres this if you ever get hungry.Bacon Wrapped French ToastPrep time:  30 minBake time:  15 minIngredients:3 thick slices of bread3 eggs2-3 tsp maple syrup2 Tbsp milkdash vanilla extract12 half strips of bacon, rawBacon Wrapped French Toast:  Sweet french toast sticks wrapped in crunchy, salty bacon.  A great hand held breakfast.First cook the bacon.  You want to slightly undercook the bacon so it is pliable and squiggly (my husband's word but I think it describes it well). Let the bacon cool on paper towels while preparing the french toast.Whisk together the eggs, milk, maple syrup, and vanilla until well beaten.  One at a time dunk a slice of bread in egg mixture and place in a buttered frying pan at medium heat.  Fry on both sides until browned.  Repeat with all the bread.Let the french toast cool until easy to handle.  Then cut each slice into 4 strips for a total of 12 french toast strips.Wrap one piece of bacon around each french toast strip.  Place seam-side down on a baking sheet.  You can use toothpicks to secure the bacon if you prefer, but as long as the ends are tucked under the toast, it will shrink during baking and cling to the french toast strip.  Cover and refrigerate until ready to bake.On gameday morning, preheat the oven to 350F with the rack in the center.  Remove the bacon wrapped french toast from the refrigerator and bake for 15 minutes until the bacon crisps.Allow to cool slightly.  Serve with maple syrup for dipping."

,Recommended,434570,20905273,"Posted: 1 February, 2016",all,Zach Fett,"Such a fun game. I played a ton of this back when it was on Xbox 360, and I plan to put a lot more time into it now that it's on PC. It's an extremely cheesy, ridiculous, disgustingly bloody game where you run around shooting pigs, kicking their body parts into a grinder to buy ammo/grenades/milk/melee boosters/etc, and talk to a farmer with a close relationship with a pitchfork.It starts off slow, but once you hit the Princess Blubbergut boss fight it all starts to get much, much more bloody and crazy. Early on you're only dealing with 10-20 pigs in a day, but after a while it'll crank up the difficulty with 50+ pigs at a time. Revenge Days are the best days of the week, giving you infinite explosive ammo and tons of pigs to gib for the grinder.There's a decent amount of weapons, 100 days (levels), and three characters to unlock. There's a lot of content here for $1! I'd highly recommend it if you enjoy horde-style games, ridiculous gore, and a game that doesn't take itself seriously.The only issues I've had with the game are not being able to rebind keys*, not able to edit the camera while using a keyboard (but you can with a controller by pressing Start), the black border around the screen no matter the resolution you use, some sound issues with gunshots, and sadly that co-op (which was on the Xbox 360 version) is not in this current PC port. However, the developer has said he's interested in doing it, but it sounds like it'll only be possible if the game sells well enough.The rest of the issues I'm sure will be fixed sooner or later. The default keybindings are fine (minus X being use, instead of E), but I'd still like to be able to rebind*.Also, the developer is extremely cool. If you have any issues, just hit him up, he responds really quickly and will try to help you fix any problems! I hope he'll bring some of his other games to Steam one day soon, I'd kill a thousand skeleton pigs just to play DeadKings (with the multiplayer included, hopefully!) on PC.*Edit: Rebinding has now been added in the most recent patch. You just have to go to your game folder, find the KEYBOARD folder, then edit the KEYS_BU.txt to your liking. Once you're done rename that file to KEYS.txt and it'll work just fine!"

,Recommended,434570,28956165,Posted: 2 January,all,Blackfang321,"EDIT: The developer sent me a reply to my feedback stating they agreed and have modified the game a hair.  To be honest, I haven't tried this new mode yet or not...but I wanted to update my review based solely on a developer that interacts with their customers.  Awesomeness!I played the single player mode on this, and was VERY dissapointed.  So basically, there are not any typical ""surivival"" aspects here.  No collecting resources or anything like that.   This is more of an ""arena"" type game where you attempt to survive wave after wave of pigs.  The pigs basically just charge forward at you and you keep shooting and strafing until they are dead.  Rinse and repeat.  Maybe it gets better....but I couldn't stick with it long enough to find out.All that being said, the game is $1 even when not on sale.  So...even though this wasn't my kind of thing...maybe it is for you?  Or maybe you have a friend that wants to strafe and shoot?  Like I said, I didn't try the multi player....so...maybe thats better?"

Just generally being a funny♥♥♥♥♥♥and pretending to sound like a total degen, The fact that you can stay pinned up to a wall by a massive pitchfork and still be bleeding for 100 days whilst still attempting to pull it off with everyday.The game is full of easter eggs.Full to the brim.The entire game is full of dark humor and I applaud the developer/s for it. It's hard not to enjoy it even having jokingly played 50 waves with 1280x720 resolution with huge black bars and the lowest settings, only to go and change them and find the game is actually optimised xD (should not be anywhere near the price range of 1$), at least 5.I recommend everyone picking Creaky Skelly. He is the mememaster assassin of the game. The greatest assassin of Skeletos, having served in the Third Great Skeleton War. I also recommend that when you and your buds roll up with your gats ready to shoot up some ♥♥♥♥ing hogs, play that funky music whiteboy and tune up that spooky scary skeletons. 10 hours. 24 hours. 48 hours. 1 year. 100 years. ♥♥♥♥, If you have to. Play that♥♥♥♥♥♥the entire time.Oh and on a sidenote: All the 40 year old unhappy vegan moms 4.3 miles near you will LOVE you for this easy trick to convert normal people into vegans! Nothing warms the heart more than watching hogs charge at you and get their heads gibbed off, watching them fall flat dead and then beating their corpses towards the incinerator purely because you want those pickups.This game is full of dark humor. Easter eggs. Blood and Gore. Blatantly funny at every corner and despite its modest price has enough gameplay in stock to entice the average player for many hours on end.Oh and I forgot to mention: Pigs can really fly.The pigs defy gravity. They jump on top of the barn, the silo..The fact that cans of meat make you a melee god is ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious. Meat makes you tough, buff burly and strong.Milk? Milk makes you literally jump like a ♥♥♥♥ing pogostick? well I mean thats. yeah.You can ride pigs, Paint them in assortments of colours whilst gatting them to death. Everything from the way the bosses are named, to the voice acting which is blatantly beyond cringe. To the things that are so far off reality that they're actually ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious, and the feel that the game is genuinely better than the Left 4 Dead series because it actually isn't grabbing for money, offering dlc after dlc. It is an original game that doesn't need mods. It is effectively better than skyrim with dank engines because the game its self does not intend to be serious. It is not afraid of showing the developer/s personality within each and every little fine detail. It is a true game. It doesn't need 4k graphics to prove its already better than majority of the market. No game comedically cuts it as much as this game does. It's a game that will never age because it follows a model that isn't desperately sought over by many other companies. In what other game do you find such uncanny references, hilarious dialogue and a game that could blatantly be hated by PETA. I ♥♥♥♥ing love it."

,Recommended,434570,29076456,Posted: 6 January,all,Toyfan1: You N'Wah!,"In Short:This game is not what you're expecting. it's so much more.Get it.Even if you don't like killing ruthless zombie animals, support this developer.it's cheap. Goes on sale for even cheaper. It's well worth the money.Spoilers: These spoilers talk about in-game unlocks and Bosses. If you want to go in blind and want to wait and see what the game has to offer, unlock wise, don't read them.The camera systemNow, before I start with the game review- The camera system in this game is amazi- No.It's more than amazing.It's perfect.No questions asked. You have 3 camera presents.First person (camera 1) , Over the Shoulder (Camera 2), and Third person (Camera 3)""Wow that's pretty cool"" you might ask.It's cooler than cool. it's ice-cold.Because you can EDIT EACH CAMERA.Do you want a top-down view of the entire map? You can do that.Do you want a foot angle where you can see everything from an ant's perspective? It's possible.You want a crotch camera where you can see nothing but your character's crotch? Do it.It's SO un to experiment with the camera angles.You can even edit the HUD. Little Big Planet Karting styleSure, Elder Scrolls may have their customizable 3rd person camera mod, but that's only one camera angle!Shadow of Morridor has a neat cinematic mode, but that's not very action-oriented.This is perfect.And with the combination of HUD placement, you can make this game feel like L4D2 had babies with metal gear solid.It's perfect. What more could you ask for?To startI saw this game and figured it would be just several asset flips.Boy was I completely wrong.The ONLY thing about this game that is bad, is the graphics and models.Everything else is Flawless.Absolute master piece.In Depth; GameplayThis is basically Devil Daggers, but it won't make you slice your eyes out.The gist is you run around a fairly small map, shooting enemies (zombie pigs) every 10 levels is a boss fight.Guns are somewhat varied. Some Pistols are very inferior to others, while the primaries have much more substance and variety,The Colt 1911 is pretty standard, nothing special but the model looks REALLY nice. 15 ammo, and fair amount of damage.Silenced pistol is pretty ok, much like the Colt but as im aware, it doesn't Aggro (Anger, Target) pigs.Revolver is pretty pointless. very small magazine, yet it has some good damage.But the paintball gun...OOoooooh my god, this paintball gun. Best. Unlimted ammo, great spammability, and the best part- you can choose what color of paintball you shoot by reloading. I always use it.Primaries:The AK is just like the Colt 1911. Very neat model, but all around good weapon.M4, just like the ak, but a better model. obviously there are differences stat wise. But again, over all good weapon.UZI, bullet hose. nuff saidShotgun, it actually got a buff. it's really tasteful to use, and you feel absolutely badass using it.Nuke. Kill a bunch of things with a nuke, low ammo, very high damage.P90, much like the UZI, yet i think has less ammo, more accuracy.They are all pretty balanced and fun. I spice it up every level.Traps, and consumables.No no, not the one-time use consumables you have to pay for- these items, such as grenades, bulkify, and Milk.These boost you're character significantly.Bulkify, 1hit melee kill pigs, Milk makes you go insanely fast and jump high. it's VERY fun to combo each.Traps on the other hand, are niche. You'll either lure a group off pigs to the center of the map to electrocute them with an electric fence, or you lure them into a grinder which helps you get the boost items.Blood and bacon consists of a many types of enemies, I couldn't list them all.You have big pigs, you have silver pigs, you have armored pigs, Skeleton pigs, GHOST PIGSInnocent non-zombified pigs, this game has ityou even have boss pigs.Boss 1Big mean grumpy pig. He is a big pig with HILARIOUS writing.boss 2Princess. The Farmer's biggest and meanest. She's fat, ♥♥♥♥♥ and pukes. Pretty hilarious to fight.That's it on the enemies and guns- but Im not done yet.over 50 levels. That's just the single player.There's multiplayer, Double co-op, 4 Mode, and even a co-op Horde mode.There's even EVENTS ike the Halloween Horde mode.This game has SOOOOO Much depth despite being 99c and or cheaper.The StoryStory is pretty basic. Farmer did some nasty stuff. But the writing. Oh my god is the writing SO ******* GOOD.Just shoot the farmer. It's hilarious. The farmer blends so well into the story. His personality, his quotes, all excellent.The Bosses interactions, and background are great too.I barely can spoil anything story wise.Graphics and AestheticBlood and bacon has that retro-1990s to 2000s look. Very few polygons, stretched images. it feels like an homage to that type of gaming history. But if you didn't experience gaming at that time, the game doesn't look too good.The graphics make this game instantly dated, despite it being released a year ago.Animations are pretty bad, but at times they can be funny. Such as being dead, and still being able to reload your gun.Reloading when you have full ammo, punching pigs, jumping high, etc.overall fine, if you can handle the poor animations.Various NotesThe Developer (s). Now, Im not sure if this game has more than one developer. But the one who is on the forums, and updating the game.They're brilliant. They're nice, responsive, and overall good developers.UpdatesSurprisingly, this game is updated often.Halloween updates, Christmas goodies, balancing, 4Player mode was even added, along with Horde mode.Just recently, all 1-42 levels (Beginner levels) were reworked to be more challenging.I'm always surprised to see this game get updates because you wouldn't expect that many updates out of a 99cent game.hatsThis game has hats.yes hats.that's all.Hats.Final ThoughtsThis game is a buck. If you go by the Dollar per Hour mentality It's well worth it.Overall, it's a good, well-made game for a flat price.I am halfway done with the game, and I have 10 hours. I expect to completely beat it by 25hs.That's not counter multiplayer, events, or trying to get all the hats.It's definitely worth the money at 99c or below, you will get SO much out of this game.Regardless-I was very surprised how much content, innovatively, and polish this game had for being a dollar.Blood and Bacon gets a special gold star from me."

Everything may look unprofessional but it's an indie game. Don't expect any AAA qualities. My only problem is that my progress restarted when I played multiplayer with a stranger. He was at day 6 and I was at 61. After that I was back at day 6 after I quit playing with him so I could continue my days. Anyway great game.

I'm going to be somewhat harsh on the game, yet keep in mind I do recommend it.Now my first 20 minutes into the game I enjoyed it, and I thought it was somewhat fun even though I was playing it single player. After about an hour though the game got stale quick. (Repeating enemies, repeating lines of dialouge, repeating bosses, etc.)I hope that content will be later added to the game, if so then I would be inclinded to play it more often. Now keep in mind that there are a lot worse games out there at much higher prices, so for $0.99 I would say it's worth it if you and a few friends want to have a giggle."

I mean, don't get me wrong, blasting the living meatchunks out of pigs is great, but that's all you do. For the entire game. It's so repetitive and mundane... Oh yeah, sure, there are bosses, but the same concepts -- Even the same animations and sound bytes -- are re-used.Oh, and one more thing, spoilers ahead.The thing that tipped me over the edge -- and I mean OVER the edge of edges -- was the final ""boss."" If you can even call it a boss. The final level that had such a massive build up was literally a group of harmless, mindless ""friendly"" pigs. When you kill all of them in a mess of bloody pig parts, like the game has taught you to do for about 6 hours, you're punished for it. Then guess what, your game restarts! That's right, you went from an astonishing day 101 back to an insufferably easy day 1.Now that's out of the way, we can talk about the mechanics. The game is basically a crude re-creation of CoD Zombies with a bit of Left for Dead thrown in there as well. The graphics aren't great, but oh well, games have limitations. Let's not forget about the ""game cheats."" Why have them? Did the developers know that people would get tired of doing the same task over and over? Well, they certainly thought ahead on that one.Anyway, it was an interesting concept, and let's be honest, who didn't draw some naughty things on the walls with the paintball gun?"

Except that the developer could never gather a team or a publisher so he had it circulating as a pet project forever, thinking it was either great, or a cheap way to earn some quick cash.This garbage has the UI, graphics, and extremely immature humor of an early, awful Playstation 1 game.  Being a PS1 game doesn't automatically make a game awful, but this one has all of the worst aspects from back then.  All of them.  Just take my word for it.  Or don't, and watch the videos, which pretty much showcase the whole game.One of my favorite things was the achievement ""Graphics Whor.e"" (without the period - that word is automatically censored otherwise) which I got for setting my correct resolution.  Yeah... that one kind of speaks for itself.  I don't think I'd recommend this even if it were free.Edit:  Just noticed that at 8 seconds in the video there's an Xbox notification of his friend coming online.  Seriously?

The sound design isn't anything out of the ordinary but is satisfying, especially when you use the rocket launcher. Most of the guns have incomplete or basically non existent reload animations, and you can reload constantly even when your magazine is full.  The voice acting for the farmer is completely awful, maybe on purpose, but the voice acting for bosses and the sounds made by the pigs and grinder are spot on. There is some occasional humor to the game, most of it coming from the Farmer's lines, the bosses and hidden messages sprawled about the farm, but the game itself is pretty funny considering you are basically murdering a ton of hogs and pigs and undead pigs.In many ways this game is like survival mode in L4D, just very barebones. Each pig you kill, you can push it's gibs or entire body into a grinder that magically turns them in to resources so you can buy grenades, revive pills, milk, ammo, nukes, and superstrength.The only negative thing I have to say about the actual gameplay is that survival mode takes a long time. 100 days. If you are actually pushing everything in to the grinder, it takes quite a while to get through each day. Every 10 days my co op partner and I would be like ""30 days and it's not over? Maybe 50 because we have like 2 guns left to unlock? Maybe 75? It's 100!?""  All in all though, sure, it's worth 90 cents for a few hours of fun until you get tired of it. I don't know what the original price of the game was but I'd still pay a few dollars more for it."

Now I am disappointed with the game, and I will tell you why :The first levels are ok, but later, it becomes repetitive and boring. All you have to do is talk to the farmer, kill pigs and thenthe same thing that you do at the beginning of every level. Not to mention that there is nothing interesting while playing the game, except killing pigs and repeat the same thing until day 101. I don't even know why they put another level after the final boss, and in the last day all you have to do is to kill non-zombie pigs. Despite the game focuses at the beginning on saving the farm, because of day 101, you will then discover that you need to sabotage it.Weapons unlock kind of hard, and some of them are way too weak. Also, not to forget, the reloading animations are messed up. The reloading system is very buggy, you can reload even when your weapon's magazine is full.Pigs are kind of durable and overpowered, especially the small ones which run very fast. Weapons do very little damage to them, and they are hard to hit. Also, at some point, you will become overwhelmed, and you need to be an expert just to handle the numerous pigs, even at days 10-30.Bosses are very weird coded. The 1st boss's attacks are very easy to dodge, and he is very slow. But oddly, extremely durable, and you need a lot of bullets to kill him.I definitely do not reccomend this game, which is full of bugs and unbalanced weapons. If you wasted and euro on buying this game, better refund it, but if you like it, I don't blame you.I refunded it and happily I got the money.Do not buy it."

All the guns have no weight to them if you move a gun around when shooting there should be A LITTLE recoil even if it is the smallest ammount it should still be there.Not like adding that would fix the issue the shotgun is god awful and shouldn't be used ever not to mention the pistols, my god the pistols are♥♥♥♥♥♥and feel like♥♥♥♥♥♥to use the revolver only holds 7 shots if I recall the default pistol does♥♥♥♥♥♥for damage and why do you hold them so weird?

The weapon variety is astounding. The music fits the incredible, desolate setting very, very well. Without giving too much away, the story is mind-blowing. You are stranded on an intergalatic farm, hurtling through space. Your navigator, ""The Farmer,"" has been severly injured and left to die on the side of a barn. Each day you must hunt down the pigs which threaten your base, and fight to uncover clues about what happened to the Earth you've left behind. I can see this game being very influential in the development of games to come.Did I mention it has Co-op? The way the story and atmosphere lends itself to multiplayer is astounding. Everything about this game is amazing. It is truly a masterpiece, the likes of which video gaming has never seen. The Mona Lisa, Beethoven's symphonies, none of those works of art hold a candle to this generation-defining magum opus. One does not ""play"" this game. One experiences it, lives it.

The only time its not that bad is the every 10 waves which throws in a boss battle, but even then the game BARELY changes and it becomes BORING! However if you have a couple of friends and maybe you just want background gameplay for a Youtube Channel, it might be worth the few cents in your steam wallet.

Now I'm here to tell you this PC version though and let me tell you there is so much that's different here that it feels like a new game entirely.Blood and Bacon is a game where you play as one of 6 characters, you go to a farm to find a farmer in a barn stuck to the wall with a pitchfork in his gut and missing leg, every new day you get to in the game the farmer will tell you some tips on how to survive and over time you will either learn to love him or hate him, and every day you come to kill all the pigs each day and then you talk to the farmer at the end of the day to start the next one.Now I'm sure your wondering, ""why is this game so Overwhelmingly Positive if it is such a simple and small game?"" Well if you have seen the trailer before looking at this review I will tell you that it is definitely the blood bath you see in it. With now up to 4 player coop where even more pigs spawn in depending on the number of players in your game you can find one hell of a time. And trust me, some days you will literally see nothing but ""Blood and Bacon"" at the end of some days.This game has lots of unlocks and a TON of secrets or fun things to do around the farm. Some you will find on your own or learn from the farmer. Meanwhile the farmer has lots of fun and interesting quotes to say depending on finding secrets on the farm, shooting the farmer, or from simply flashing your flashlight in his face.And customizable camera angles is one of the 'bigger' features this game has. With three different camera angle options on top of customizing them yourself and moving the cameras allows you to make the game first or third-person or whatever you see fit.The bosses are fun and definitely challenging to learn and do for your first time and I am sure you may think 'wtf' on day 10, then 'what the hell' on day 20 leading all the way to the final day where you will definitely need some help because these bosses are of a Dark Souls quality here. Which comes onto the second topic here...Multiplayer is definitely a fun blast to play and with the new 6-player horde map you can unlock even more secrets and one of the now 9 characters they have in this game now. Not only that but this game also has....keyword here.....free hats for your characters if you find keys which requires you to look around for secrets and such. But there are also other secrets leading to the farmer to say some 'clever' farm jokes and even sing a song.When you play this game you will DEFINITELY see pig parts flying around and definitely some blood flying all over the farm. And yes, you do fight hundreds of pigs at a time some days and revenge days are where this game really shines.Trust me, this game is worth it for it's 0.99 price and at the time of this review 0.79 price. Definitely worth the dollar price and why would you ignore this game during it's sale? I have bought this game many times and I never regret a single time I purchased this game. And by the time your done you will see pigs in a new light and definitely have a hunger for BLOOD & BACON."

The game does take place on a farm, and does make use of an animal. By killing them all! Right after some brief dialogue to prep talk you into doing it too =)! **Spolier** I reccomend shooting the farmer in as many spots as possible, for more dialogue ;)!!**I would have loved to nominate another game, but I feel like any other game would be too good for such a nomination. *Triple A game, gets nominated for... Best use of a farm animal! Wooo* Said no one ever.  It would almost seem insulting to the rest of the game itself anyhow. But this game.. This game basically revolves around this nomination. Perfect fit!-- Honestly. I didnt get too far into the game myself. But late at night, and with a friend. The dialogue for the first, Hmm, 10 or so levels had us cracking up! Afterwards.. It sort of gives a smile or two for the next dozen levels. So dont expect too much laughing, but do expect some while under a good mood. There's defintely way more levels than what I've played through, and BOSS wise, some were... Yeah.. hahah.. Depending on your humour you might actually sucker in some more laughs from the game. Do keep in mind. The game is only a dollar! Even less on sale! So to spend a dollar on cheap humour, isn't the worst thing in the world, given the context. So if you decide to get it, enjoy! If not, no worries, you're not missing too much at all."

Cheesy, funny and unexpected. Worth its price.Full ReviewBlood and Bacon (BnB) takes wave survival to a whole new level: instead of the standard ""survive against waves of monsters/zombies"", BnB tasks you to survive againstmonster/zombie pigs!It's a game meant to be funny and laughable.Wave survival games, as I see it, are meant to be multiplayer games. I couldn't see my self doing the same task over and over alone. It gets repetitive quickly, but that's the point of it: to see how much you can endure.The community is scarce, but everytime I'd play I'd see like 3 other servers online, so it has its followers.I played with a couple of friends and it was a funny experience. I'd classify this little gem as casual and mind-numbing, intended for you to play to chill and laugh.As for graphics, they are outdated, but that's the charm of it. Sounds are repetitive, just never mind.I'd recommend it for it's price, but only if you can find someone to play with you occasionally."

,Recommended,434570,29647954,Posted: 2 February,all,Rev3rEND,"Don't go into this expecting Fallout, DOOM, or hell even Serious Sam.  Keep your expectations in check and you'll have fun.  The mechanics are very simple but work: every ten days is a ""boss"" fight, you slowly unlock more and more weapons as you progress through the days, use the grinder to grind up the pigs to fill ammo, grenades, etc etc.  That's it.  Oh, and of course survive.Controls a bit too twitchy and exact, as in your character will move at a single speed with no build up as soon as you hit a  direction and stop dead in his tracks the moment you let go.  A bit jarring but they could be worse.  Graphics are subpar, audio is weak, the Farmer's quips and phrases are entertaining at first but get tiresome.But it's a buck and it works fine... and it's fun with friends.  Just do it."

The game is extremely bad but I feel that it was on purpose and that the developers knew it was bad and made it into a joke . But surprisingly this game is very funny and has loads of secrets and easter eggs the boss fight have reasonably good mechanics ( it's not just a bigger pig with more health) . The game is worth 99 cent and getting it on sale is crazy the developers (I think) put in 99 cents worth of a game and I really,honestly feel satisfied with my purchase .Send a copy of this to any vegan/vegetarian friends or enemys you have, sit back and watch them cry10/10 will enrage vegans"

I would make a sentence long password or something, paste it to 2-3 other friends. SOMEHOW someone still manages to join in. I even tested this out by randomly smacking the keyboard for a password and sending that to a friend. WELL BY GOLLY WHO IN TARNATIONS IS THIS GUY. Now a lot of the people that have managed to join us, the ones that I didn't boot out the room instantly, most of them were okay people....except I still booted them. HOWEVER, there was ONE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who joined our room. He didn't even load up. He basically sat AFK or was never there in the first place, and that was it. You see a loading character model, and thats it. This literally stopped us from playing because I CAN'T KICK HIM, and we can't open the farm door to start the game because this motherhumper was probably purposely trolling us by sitting AFK on the character select screen to prevent us from playing, we don't even know what his name was.Some players have complained about getting kicked from games for no reason. Heres a thought, maybe you entered a room that was password restricted. You may think ""how is that possible, I don't know the password"". Well I can't answer that but from MANY experiences, people are able to join PASSWORD LOCKED lobbies. Complete strangers that are uninvited showing up in my friends only PASSWORD LOCKED rooms warrants a kick."
