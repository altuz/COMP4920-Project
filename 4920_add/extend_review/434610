If you try and protect other planets, then the game becomes impossible as resources are spread too thinly.The developer needs to make the resource acquisition rate higher, that way it's possible to defend more than one planet.In summary you can win at this game, but it has little to do with strategy."

It is your job to destroy them, skimming the planet's surface and blasting them out. Forbidden Planet is viewed form the cockpit of your craft, with the action displayed in vector graphics. You must shoot out Anti-Aircraft towers and guided missiles for points, while avoiding the damage they can inflict. As well as controls, options include limiting some of the sound effects, and arranging the in-game display in 3 different ways.Forbidden Planet's a pace racing, addictive game - shame it crashed when I was just beginning to clock up a reasonable score!CategoryDescriptionUser ScoreSTORYWriting and voice acting.1 out of 5OPTIONSOffline modes.1 out of 5CONNECTIVITYOnline modes plus second screen, apps, and social networks.1 out of 5GRAPHICSArtistic and technical visual presentation.1 out of 5SOUNDMusic, sound effects, and mix.1 out of 5INTERACTIONHow a game controls regardless of input type.1 out of 5PROGRESSIONBalance, unlock rates, challenge, and matchmaking.1 out of 5VALUECost versus enjoyable playtime1 out of 5Overall User ScoreAverage1.00"

However for £0.79 this game is a waste."

,Not Recommended,434610,29449523,Posted: 23 January,all,Bill Nye The Soviet Spy,"I bought this game for about 0.25 USD and I feel ripped off. Oh wait, I was. This game has no action or adventure, no fun, no decent plot or anything. This game is only worth it for trading cards... but the cards are far from redeeming this game. Don't let yourself buy it. Just Don'tEdit: Only enemies are asteroids."
,Not Recommended,434610,30908507,Posted: 2 April,all,Monterico Gaming TV,Hard to say no to a dollar but I am going to try. This defense game just felt rushed. The UI will bug up and not close and simple things keep it from being playable. Avoid and by some steam cards. I picked this game up for about 10 cents with a steam coupon. Still not worth it. :) Good Gaming

That said there are a few things that could do with improvement. Re-fueling is a constant pain and expensive and the menu/system for buying new items could do with some tool tips or a written explanation of what it is. Other wise it is a fairly good 2D planet defense game...."
,Recommended,434610,32082772,Posted: 31 May,all,Xuno,The game isn't that bad for a dollar and also if you get a coupon since it would cost like ten cents which its ok. Its a good time killer so yea.I can get why people don't really like this game it can get repetive but still its an okay game.

76561198142743836,Not Recommended,434610,29171858,Posted: 10 January,all,Ragnar the Red,"Good mechanics and good visuals, but the music could be more exiting, the game itself needs more items to explore and a bit more fuel capacity to travel even further. It has a little lack of dinamism when you fly arround between meteor waves. try putting guns in the spaceship and some hostile npc's."
