You could solve these with lots of algebra: label all unknown lengths with letters, make equations, and solve for x; however, that's not how it's done. Instead, you look at the puzzle sharply, maybe draw an extra line or two, and then solve using only simple area formulas and whole-number-ratios. (Despite the name, I didn't need Pythagoras at all, only to recognize the 3-4-5 right triangle in one puzzle.) That means geometric deductions, not number crunching! Fractions are not allowed! If you're good at geometry, you can do the whole thing in an hour (10 minutes for the first 20,  30 minutes for the next 29, and 20 minutes for the final 11 or so). Others may find this a bit more challenging (seehere).I liked it.This game runs on my old Windows XP computer."
,Recommended,434620,20747847,"Posted: 25 January, 2016",all,Vic=HKC=,"Well, I know, I know, rewritting an entire positive review so soon isn't usual. But as the developer updated the game in the good direction, I can't let my rant about fractions and whole numbers here.Pythagoria is a game relying on maths. You have 60 puzzles to solve, divided in three chapters with 20 of them. The first one is mainly about rectangle surfaces, side lenghts, etc.. when the rest is kinda more complicated with triangles or circles (well I didn't say circles per se but well, you'll see it if you play the game).Visually, you have several geometrical figures with some indications (surface in cm², side length, etc..) and your goal is to find or a surface or a length behind a question mark.Anyway, my initial rant was about fractions and whole numbers. True, at first, many of us understood that the resolution used only whole numbers. In reality, you can use any number, fraction or letters - the only thing that matters is that the answer is always a whole number. So, when you see a surface of 32 cm² with a side of 14 cm, it's normal. Don't think that it's a mistake, nope, it's not. So, when this confusion is cleared, the puzzles are suddenly more easier to solve.Visual inconsistency is also an important factor in this game. While there is still problems with it as it's not with perfect proportions (and you have to understand that the game can't answer to perfection), at least, it's less disturbing, because when you 1 cm² being the same as 5 cm², it's not comfortable. Still, here, sometimes, you're under the impression that you have two exact lengths when it's not the case.Anyway, the last point that was also controversial was the help. Only the rectangle formula was included, so, when you're confronted to a triangle, you need all your memory to remember your maths. Hunter, the developer, expanded it after we pointed the lack of more explanations or formulas.The good point is the possibility of using a pencil in-game so that you can write your reasoning directly on the screen. However, you don't have any voice for the color: it's red. And it's not smooth, my numbers are a series of clear dots. I know that there is a problem of hardware or GPU or something like that.The soundtrack is a very good one, very enjoyable.But I imagined the game as a tool for drilling in maths students. In other words, as I work in digital education, I've been interested in this game for that matter - as a gamer, I would have passed the game, because maths and I, we're not two but we're not really friends. In the education context, it's not usable, even with the help expanded. Because well, a good thing would also to have an explanation of how it's solved, which would be a nice bonus when you're only pressing the numbers and pray that it's the right answer.For the price, it's still a nice bargain. I would say that now, the thumb up is really deserved and isn't one of encouragement for the developer. But I suppose that more challenges would be also a good idea, right now, I wish there were more - even if maths and I..."

I would argue with the maths, but you can't argue with someone who keeps changing the rules. The puzzles are inconsistent, incongruent, and irreverant. >:-[ It's like playing cards with some one who is making up the rules as you go. Of course many of the inconsistencies are intentional, like with the incorrect dimensions. Then there are the errors sprinkled in like salt, the fact that you can accurately assume the answer to many with no math, and the puzzles which contradict the designer's own rules. Oh, and what about the one with no question? 3.7 has no unknown to solve. [/]I will concur that the puzzles are intended to be ""recreational maths."" They are also deliberately represented by incorrect dimensions in drawing, presumably to force you to use the numbers. It doesn't always work, as in the case of 3.17, which is pretty obvious in a way that violates the game's design rules. And, 3.18 has glaring inconsistencies.  [/]In defense of the designer, the game appears to be incomplete. I think he is still trying to ""polish it up"" a bit, from what I read in his answers on the forum. But, IMHO, that would be a bit like rearranging chairs on a ship that's sinking. My suggestion would be to come up with a way to represent the math without the shapes being drawn incorrectly, for one. But, then again, the answers are multiple choice and you are bound to get it right. [/]Though it's an easy 100% game I can't recommend it. I mean, there are better puzzles out there... and better designers who would take this great subject matter and make it work. But, hey... kudos for the great idea! [/]***Update:I had a second look at the game, afterwhat appears to be an update. I did not see any of the problems I mentioned changed in any way. My opinion of the game itself remains unchanged. I really do love Math puzzlers. And, I can recommend Two Digits, Three Digits, (which I'm still trying to beat) and Energy Balance if you're looking for great Math Puzzles.But, I noticed recently that cards were added, and I have to add that the artwork is great. The backgrounds are great Math art and I'm using one on my profile now. If you are just looking for some neat Math art... here it is! The cards and emoticons are geometry shapes. But, the backgrounds are neat patterns and Math equations with a blackboard look. The profile badges have images of famous Greek Mathemations. If you're into art the cards are for you."

Although the game was never going under 1.20 EUR I decided once to buy to have some fun and an easy 100% also.But what I encountered is more than disappointing. There are 3 packs a 20 puzzles. Over rectangles, triangles to circle cutouts. The proportions say me that the smaller square cannot have a bigger shape than the bigger one. BUT UNTRUE. Also the side length usually gets extracted by dividing it out of the shape size and the known side. NOT HERE.It seems this puzzle game has it's own logic to prevent the player for dividing to floating numbers. Somekind of plusminus game I don't understand and I don't want to understand.

Not only 60.- It's easy to cheat (why would you anyway? but it is). All puzzles are a multiple-choice question, in which you can pick from 1 to 9 (using larger numbers with a manual input system could've been better). Guesses a wrong answer? Doesn't matter, just pick another.- The interface is not nice:- The pencil tool makes a slow series of dots, which forced me to draw really slowly if I wanted to actually write something that's not written with dotted lines. So I ended up using a physical notebook for taking notes.- The eraser just erases all your notes, so you can't erase a particular note. You're better off striking it through.- The difficulty does not progress nicely. It goes up and down all the time, especially from lvs 21 to 60.+ But it is indeed a very cheap game.+ And it also has trading cards, if you're into it.+ If you're an achievement hunter, this game is really easy to 100%.I can't say this is a bad game that should be avoided at all costs, but weighing pros and cons, I realized the only pros were cards, achievements, low price, and content that you can get for free on the internet. If the pencil tool would work better, I'd probably change my review to a thumbs up, since the game interface would be worth the small investment."

76561198025020917,Recommended,434620,20761983,"Posted: 26 January, 2016",all,jgf1123,"Pro:Can make you smarter if you let it.Most puzzles can be solved by young students who don't know fractions, algebra, or plane geometry.Con:Can get repetitive.Some puzzles seem to require more sophisticated math.I work for a math education company, but we don't sell anything that competes with this game, so take this as an unbiased review by someone who teaches and uses math on a daily basis.Note that my first ""Pro"" bullet isn't, ""Can teach you something.""  You will learn very little geometry or algebra or whatever doing these puzzles.  At best, you'll practice your multiplication and division skills a lot, but that's elementary.  Well, elementary school level.  So what do I mean by the game can make you smarter?When most people think of math, they think of boring drills where they plugged numbers into formulas and and other numbers.  It's mindless busywork because the students are just grinding through procedures like an automaton.  There's little need to be creative or think on their feet.  Take a look at Problem 1.1 in the screenshots.  If a student saw this on a standardized test, they'd probably start by finding the width of the area 10 rectangle.  But, oh gawd!, now they have a fraction.  Then they have to add 2, then divide 16 by the resulting fraction.  That sounds tedious in the extreme, and I have an engineering PhD, so it's not like fractions scare me.Now look at the solution given in the screenshots: by filling in the missing rectangle, we observe that we have two rectangles of equal size.  This is just one big rectangle cut in half, so the unknown height must equal the height of the other half.  No adding or dividing by fractions!  Rather than follow the obvious path, by being creative and considering alternative approaches (something modern math education doesn't do very well, sadly), we find a far less painful, more elegant solution.  What these puzzles do is make you better at solving problems: we have some information, and we have a problem we want to solve.  Someone with good problem solving skills can get there more quickly and easily.That said, allow me to critique the problems in this game: Take a look at Problem 1.16 in the screenshots.  We fill in the missing rectangle as before.  We notice there are two rectangles of area 28 and 56, so right one is 2 times the width of the left, and we're done.  Now take a look at Problem 2.5 in the screenshots.  Again, the key is finding the area of hidden rectangles and looking at the ratio of areas.  A lot of puzzles in the game involving rectangles are like this, though you still have to be canny and figure out which areas and what ratios.  But there were only maybe a dozen puzzles that made me stop and say, ""Ooh, that's new.  What's the best way to deal with that?""  I could have used more of those moments.Even worse, there a couple puzzles where the solution is the unimaginative tedious method of figuring out all of the side lengths.  I'm looking at you Problems 1.18 and 2.18.  You're well past the initial training exercises and have no excuse.Leaving the puzzles using rectangles, there are puzzles using triangles and circles, like 3.2 in the screenshots.  But they have to keep it simple since pi and geometric theorems are off-limits, so I found these problems to be pretty trivial compared to the rectangles.  Though there were a few problems where I resorted to algebra or using properties of similar triangles, which seems to violate the premise that these are puzzles that can be solved without math more sophisticated than areas and ratios.While we're on the subject, the whole conceit of these puzzles is that there are ways to solve them without using fractions.  What we could do with Problem 1.1 is to put it in the copier and enlarge it by a factor of 3: the area 10 rectangle now has height 9 and area 90.  Now it's width is no longer a fraction.  In fact, we can now solve this puzzle the humdrum way without running into any fractions.  We could do this to every rectangle problem in the game, making them tedious but trivial to compute.Don't do that though.  Despite my complaints that I wish there were a greater variety of ideas and fewer straightforward problems, the times when the game did make me say, ""Ah!  I see!  So now this is twice that, and these two are equal, and we're done.  Cool!"" was worth the $2.  These moments only happen if we accept the no fraction rule and are forced to get creative."

As a Math lover, I couldn't resist.Yet, something so simple and easy to manipulate as numbers is horribly used in here.In the first tests you have to guess what is the lenght, width or area of a rectangle/square. Pretty simple, right? For the area you multiply lenght and width and for any of the sides you do the oposite (divide the area with the lenght or width). That is very basic.The formula itself it correct in this game. The Math, however, nope.9 x 9 = 81. That is basic multiplication table, we all know it.Then how come the game says 9 x 9 = 80?How come that an even simplier multiplication as 3 x 1 = 3 ends up in the game as 3 x 1 = 1?As I said, I love Math. To see a game specifically made to teach math to fail in such a way hursts. A lot."
,Recommended,434620,21239745,"Posted: 15 February, 2016",all,Twistor,"TL;DR: A puzzle game about doing trigonometric brain-teasers.A bold move: create a game based on math. It was an insta-buy for me though.SCIENCE!InPythagoriayou get to solve geometry and trigonometry problems. In a given puzzle there's a bunch of squares, rectangles, triangles and sometimes even circles. Your task is to find the correct answer to certain length or area.It's certain that you need some knowledge of math to proceed and whether you like & know math will determine whether you like the game. All the required knowledge should become available to children of age 13-15 in most school systems. It includes calculating areas of triangles, rectangles and circles and using knowledge of (right) angles, trigonometry and Pythagorean theorem to deduce other angles and associated side lengths.That said, every solution is an integer from 1 to 9. It doesn't mean that no other length or area in the puzzle could have a non-integer solution, but it does mean you could easilycheatguess all the answers and be done with it. I would argue you'd be missing the point but who am I to judge though?It's a trap!The problems are nice brain-teasers: some can be solved in a few seconds, others take tens of minutes of intense deduction (if you refrain from guessing). The in-game pen makes it simpler to solve many of the problems.Some problems look like they were pulled directly from a high-school math book (which is fine and likely) so it might look like a scheme to make you do math.Bright background is inconvenient when playing in a dim-lit room in the middle of the night, but it seems to be the unfortunately established part of Unity puzzle games. At least it's not completely white, which alleviates it a bit.Music is the usual forgettable but relaxed tune, though a bit on the groovy side. I think classical orchestrated music would have fit this game better, although the soundtrack was otherwise fine.The end?Playtime will vary tremendously depending on your knowledge of math, ingenuity and whether you guess. Without guessing I had completed all 60 puzzles in 4.5 hours and rehearsed a bit of my knowledge of trigonometry in the process.It left me craving for more. Puzzles don't change on playthroughs but as replay value goes, you may come back to practice and try them again after a bit, having forgotten the solutions. However for $2-game I think it had enough content anyway even if you didn't. For the low price it's a nice little game. But probably only if you like geometry and math."

I'm stuck between giving this one a thumbs up and a thumbs down. I've got a list of pros and cons of the game, but it was still tough to decide whether its thumbs up or down.Pros:-Even without the game being on sale the game is still a low price. If it's on sale even better, you can pretty much make your money back within the trading cards.-MS Paint type tool to keep track of where you are with the solving of the level.-The controls within the game are incredibly easy to understand. You think the answer is 4? Click 4. Done.-Easy achievements as they don't require anything other than just playing through the game.Cons:-There is no replay value to the game. When you make it through a level that's pretty much it unless your memory is absolutely horrible.-Even if your first answer is wrong you can pretty much click any other answer quickly... which pretty much nullifies the main goal to the game which is to solve the different puzzles.-If you're half decent at math or have a general education you don't spend too much time on the game which makes it a quick quick solve.So in conclusion, the idea for the game is fantastic and makes you think (at least it tries to), but the way the developer has done the game you don't really need any thinking to get through a level. You only need a little bit of luck or just quick clicking to get the right answer to move onto the next level. If you can get it on sale it is worth it, if it's not on sale it's still borderline worth it if you want to train your brain for a little bit. Overall, I give it about a 5.5/10 which is good enough for me to give it a thumbs up. If there was an indifferent thumb (or no thumb) I'd rate it as that instead."

Just remember that like in Geometry work, the visuals are usually not to scale.If you get stuck, the answers are few enough to just brute force an answer, and there are two different Steam guides that provide answers and explanations for your benefit.At this price, take the plunge! I actually find the music and visuals along with the unlimited time make it a great game to relax to."

They're at the level of difficulty as some AMC 8 problems.The built-in annotation feature is poorly designed unless you're amazing at drawing numbers in MS Paint.I don't feel like I've achieved anything from playing this, except a reminder of how much I hate calculating fractions in my head. It's a very short game  you can beat in 1-2 hours.In addition, I've noticed 2 bugs:Full screen does not crop properly on my PC.

However, it can be perplexing and adds some difficulty for graphic oriented people.The possibility to use the game surface for writing some calculations is a nice plus factor, and that the pen is quavering makes the result to look quite handwritten as mine on a piece of paper.I needed 2.7 hours to find all 90 solutions, i.e. a little bit less than 2 minutes for each. I found it worth the money and would have a look at a new version.Instead of using solution guides, it would be better to have the possibility to get a hint in game (but such coding is more complicated and I personally prefer that the efitor adds more levels than help).

The music is annoying and distracting after a while, but you can always turn that off; The rounding to nearest whole thing is also annoying and feels off, and I'd rather be able to type in the exact answer, but that's probably for the sake of presentation and tablet-type controls; The handwriting interface is just useless when you don't have touchscreen and have to write by mouse, and its much faster and easier to use pretty much anything else (notepad, paper, charcoals on cave walls, etc.)But beyond all those superfluous gimmicks, the core game is there, and that bit works fine.
