You might not like it, but it won't make you angry that you wasted $0.99 on it.Pros:- Decent graphics- Good atmosphere- Gameplay concept is quite alrightCons:- No story, well, actually there is, but the way it's told is very amateurish. ""At least they tried"", I said.- The gameplay is bad, it depends purely on luck. There is no ""playing"" at all.Just my 2 cents, perhaps they can change it into texas poker. The ""bluff"" system is as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as any poker games out there. Need better AI to feel the gamble.I'll recommend this for now, maybe they'll try to optimise the game. It has rooms to improve and looks promising on paper."

The developer should have run the script by a native english speaker to give it a quick looking over before publishing it, because it's a mess, with lots of grammatical errors and typos.The mysterious game that this sinister entity is forcing you to play for your freedom? It's Old Maid with a bluffing system. I was expecting some sort of intricate double fanucci with the demonic host laughing and quipping when the players screwed up, building tension before each elimination. Nope. Old Maid with a bluffing system. So much disappointment.On the bright side, it was a dollar, and it's got trading cards, if you're into those. Otherwise, give it a pass."

Lamia's Game Room is a mystery card game that plays [for me] similar to Old Maid, with a visual novel type story tied to it. It's a bit short, it took me about 4-5 hours to beat and get all of the achievements. At the time I played, spelling and grammatical errors plauged the entire game.The game is all about fooling your opponent by playing your cards and when you can, expressions right. You got a ""Lamia"" card you need to get your opponent to take and hold onto, so they ""lose."" I focued more on the gameplay then the story, though I didn't feel it very interesting.The levels starting out were rather simple, easy to catch on and get into the rhythm. Towards the end, the characters you're playing against get a lot better and their factial give aways are no longer always accurate.I recommend this on I enjoyed the gameplay and goth-style art, though this game is NOT for everyone."
,Recommended,434680,21291384,"Posted: 18 February, 2016",all,Hawk Zombie,"So, this is basically a visual novel that is poorly translated (or written, maybe both), and uses the Old Maid game mechanic.At times even if you feel you have a read on your opponent's tell you'll still pick the wrong card, and there will be times no matter what you do you'll end up losing. This can work in your favor sometimes: I was in the clear on the first turn, as 4 of my 5 cards were matches, and my opponent to my left was the first to pick cards, thus eliminating my hand. It still feels very RNG-ish, however, which can be a bad for something like this.If the 'tells' were a little more visual or if they said something you could make an educated guess from that would be a big improvement. There were several times I had to win four games in a row and lost on my fourth game due to sheer luck. Very frustrating.To be honest, while the story had its issues, it was the only reason I kept playing. It isn't a BAD game per say, just not very well put together.HOWEVER, I am going to recommend this because of the price. The art is great, it has a creepy atmosphere, and you genuinely want to know more about the story. Plus, achievements simply for playing and beating the game (nothing missable). Worth it."

Although the premise involves 'finding out your opponents' weakness', that really only works until halfway through the game. After that point, the patterns of each opponent are so vague you have a better chance just doing random guesses.The translation is terrible, but at least it's still comprehensible most of the time. The story is nonexistent.  Whenever it feels like a character is getting some development or the game is hinting to something you jump right into the next chapter and that's never mentioned again.Spoiler alert, if you manage to brave through 11 short but boring as hell matches, your big reward is a 'to be continued' screen as the game ends without even trying to explain anything about the plot it pretends to have. And that's just lovely."

Unfortunately there is almost nothing in this game that is enjoyable. The english was garbage, the whole game is covered in misspellings and grammer mistakes. The gameplay had no depth to it whatsover,When the character's face shows the tell, it is the bad card, pick any other card.using that strategy, I was able to win everytime, except for 2 times, with there being about 10 card games* or so, makes the gameplay so boring.The story is also horrible and non-existent. The game tries to be mysterious, and will after the occasional chapter, try to drop a ""clue"" like a mysterious family photo or something. They are for the most part, literally useless, they have no impact on anything. As someone who can get subtlety and can find hidden meanings, I can assure you there are none here. One last thing about the story, there is an extra chapter ""twist"", when viewed under the conversations of the rest of the game, actually creates some plotholes and was a clearly rushed ending.So yeah, nothing really in this game is good, go get anything else.*The matches themselfs require 4 wins minimum, and you lose and restart if you lose twice. While this does make luck less of a deciding factor, it drags out the matches for soooooo long. When I was doing a quick mental recount, I could have sworn there were more card games in this than that, but nope, they are just really long. For someone who likes the card game it might be better, but for me who hated it, it was a real chore and dragged on and on."
,Recommended,434680,25709633,"Posted: 26 September, 2016",all,Vively,"Pretty decent little card game, though it's too short and took me only a bit more than an hour to finish, but I enjoyed it regardless of it's cons. It lacks the story and has terrible English translation, but that's not really a big deal since we get a hint of continuation at the end of the game.The art and the soundtrack are very nice, as well as the game's atmosphere. A lot of reviewers say it's purely based on luck - not true. All you have to do is be smart and watch opponents' reactions, analyze them and do it fast. The game worth it's price, so grab it if you like card games with a twist or enjoy fooling people in games."

After you know the faces next is know what buttom make he choose other card, basicly you have 4 options, 3 of them have an effect in opponet the other well do nothing is error in typo it should be cancel.the last 2 stages are more luck than anything else...well i will not spoiler here but for last 2 you requieres more than just what learned in the rest of stages....and btw...this to devoloper....continue really O.O?the art make me remember dangaropa de anime ...i will buy that game only to make them put the 2nd game on steam T.T."

In early rounds the tells are fairly clear and consistent, so even if you get unlucky and lose the first time, by the second game you should be able to bluff each of your two opponents enough to tip the scales.Later opponents however clearly have much more complicated patterns to how and what they react to and how they bluff that you can't reasonably work out, so about all you have is randomly clicking one of your three bluff options any time you have the Lamia (Old Maid) card in the hope you pick the right one, apart from that you just need to keep playing until you get lucky enough times.Overall this isn't a great game, if the translation was there the storyline might have been enough to make it worth playing as a whole, but the card game it is based on just isn't a good fit for a computer game by it's nature."

I honestly had doubts before pushing the ""buy"" button when I read the mixed reviews, I wasn't sure if this would be good enough, granted that impulse purchasing has always failed me one way or another, but boy- aren't I glad I YOLO'd this. I guess it's part of the gamble, huh?As mentioned by other reviews, this game is played out just like Old Maid and your goal is to fool your opponents by playing your cards right, per se. All the cards were designed to symbolize the 7 sins (Pride, Wrath, Gluttony, Sloth, Lust, Envy, Greed), which sort of foreshadows the characters in a way. Alongside with an extra ""Lamia Card"", basically the Joker that you need to get rid of, if you ever find one landing on your hands. You have Suspic/Doubt (pretend to be suspicious), Nervo/Nervou (pretend to be nervous), Grin (literally), 3 reactions to trick your opponents into picking the Lamia Card, which is only available if you got one on your hands. It was quite easy at first, as soon as I found the pattern it was a breeze rushing through the chapters. At the later on chapters though, namely the last few rounds took me one or two tries to get through, because the opponents stopped reacting the way I thought they would and their poker faces fooled me quite a few times.I'm not a fan of card games, but this game definitely takes the cake out of all the others I've played. The story was told in such a way that resembles the Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors series and Sweet Fuse ~By Your Side~ (And especially the anime, Death Parade!). It gave off of this feeling that left me crossing my fingers and panicked whenever I failed to trick the others. It engaged me into feeling like I was in that room, playing by Lamia's rules, and that I had to do my best to help The Player (The main character) to escape this madness.At most times, I don't appreciate open ended games with incomplete story, I guess that's just my preference. This game had exactly that, it dropped hints here and there, sometimes an important piece of information could be found in dialogues, and at other times, it was those obvious evidences that were left behind by the previous round's losers. The game expects the player to gather up information, organize them and conclude them on our own. Granted, the game does lack on the delivery aspect, as most often than not, it expected a lot out of the player to have a good understanding of the plot, while init of itself isn't as clear as day. If you so desire to throw on your wool coat and whip out your thinking hat to play detective, then this game would prove to be quite enjoyable, at least by my standards. Although in the end, the game didn't explain everything exactly, even when the situation was understood, because of how enjoyable the game was, I anticipated for a sequel (or a prequel) to this (soon to be made?) series."

Bought it & regret it inmediatly.No skill require; plain luck. The concept looks awesome but the execution is SO lame, that the game becomes dull, repetitive, pointless, boring & annoying.There are a few things (such as the 'heart monitor' at the lower left corner of the screen) that are there just because. They do not impact in the game whatsoever.My advice? Don't buy this game."

It is not big mistakes, but small stupid mistakes which could easily had been avoided, if the developer had checked one extra time or have someone fluent correct them.Another (semi)failure is the bluffing-system which works as intended most of the time. I had a lot of trouble with it in the final chapter, and finally I won at my 12th attemped.If you are into using your skills instead of luck in a game, this is NOT the game for you. And if you cannot ignore the problems with the grammar and the bluffing system you should stay away from the game too..The GOOD things about the game is the art. This was the pure reason for my purchase. At some points ingame I was even a little spooked by the art, which is a HUGE PLUS in my opinion!And then I personally like the game ""Old Maid"", or whatever you english-people call it. In Denmark it is named ""Sorteper"", and it woked a lot of fond memories from my childhood."
