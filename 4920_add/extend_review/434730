,Recommended,434730,20948706,"Posted: 4 February, 2016",all,flicker.exe,"The game is pretty similar to the film ""Cube"", where a group of people are in a room and under, above, before, behind and besides them are other rooms, all separated by a door. In some of the rooms are traps, to check a room for a trap you have to throw one of your shoes in the room. As the shoe is lost once you've thrown it in a room with a trap you can only check two rooms with traps (you have only two shoes), if there are still other traps you have to find another way to check them.The menu is a bit confusing, for example you can adjust the mouse sensitivity not under controls but under ""General"", where you can also change the language (currently is only english availabe).In Singleplayer you play - surprise, surprise - alone, you also have only two shoes to check traps with.In Multiplayer you can play as a team - with this you can stay all together or spread out, but if you do so you'll get lost for sure so better stay together ;-)You have more shoes to check the rooms for traps ofc (every person has two)On difficulty hard are more traps than on easy but it's not like a trap coming suddenly killing you, you just need a bit more time to go through the rooms that's all.The game is currently Early Access, you can also see this on some points, but right now it's still worth a try."

,Recommended,434730,28162567,"Posted: 3 December, 2016",all,wizcreations,"A round of Half Dead only takes a few minutes to win or lose.  The game has a very simple concept, but it is also pretty fun if you play with a group of friends. You're stuck somewhere in a grid of adjacent rooms.  One room somewhere in the grid at a location unknown to you contains an exit.  The rest of the rooms contain a surprise that is usually unpleasant. A small number of rooms are safe, most have traps that may kill you if you're not careful, and a few will kill you no matter what you do if you enter. One very interesting mechanic is that you can throw one of your shoes into a room to see if it triggers any traps, but when you're out of shoes, you never know which room may be your last. This leads to very interesting discussions in group chat about finding new pairs of shoes.The different game modes do very little to add replayability.  We were playing on the hardest difficulty setting and still managed to successfully reach the exit in nearly every game.  The game is fun for a few hours, but I don't see myself coming back to it unless everyone else in my group wants to try it again.Don't buy this game if you intend to play solo.  It's really only enjoyable if you have a group of friends willing to risk life and limb together in a deadly race to the finish."

Dead multi-player so finding people to play with is truly impossible.Some small notes on the game:~ More traps are needed~ More room diversity~ Better shoe economy; getting shoes is pure luck~ Winning and dying shouldn't happen within 50 seconds of starting a fresh game~ Some traps are unneeded (Gas chambers?)~ Re-invent the multi-player!  It can be good with just a few changes and some life put into it.VERDICT: You definitely want this game.  Just bring some friends.  The game is pocket change.This review was written only after completing the game to it's fullest, 100% capacity.

It is still in early access but there's development and the game is improving.It's quite entertaining when playing with friends and trying to find the exit before you lose both of your shoes to traps and fear for getting implaled with floor spikes, burned alive, explode into little bits, get sliced by a moving laser grid, be electrocuted.There's probably gonna be more traps and more advanced mechanics in the future and for a very low price I think this game is good addition to anyone's library."

A very simple but rather fun game of survival as you try and make your way to the end, you must face rooms that may be either safe or your last chance at life as your tore into pieces.

All 15 of the traps will seem boring, repeditive and you'll just wish the damn doors would open faster. The enemy 'monsters' are particularly pitiful.If you're going to base a game around random encounters there needs to have enough randomisation and player mechanics to keep it interesting. Considering the entire game is just one duplicated room, there's no real excuse for being so lazy about this.Overall the game feels very half finished, like they had the bare bones of a game and figured that was enough to release it. Its a shame because I think with more work this game could be quite popular.For many it's probably worth grabbing for its low cost, and even I'm not going to refund this game as this game might be fun to show friends for a quick laugh. But I can't rightfully recommend it for the reasons I've given.I would love to see the developers add more content, steam workshop added or another game building upon this concept further.Update- While steam workshop has been released, until more traps are added my review is still current."

,Recommended,434730,21015395,"Posted: 6 February, 2016",all,0Bennyman,"So, What exactly is Half Dead? Half Dead is a SinglePlayer/Multiplayer game which pits you and others (I presume, the multiplayer server list is currently bugged and I haven't tried it yetI am correct, that is what you do and the multiplayer is now fixed 1 day after this review) in a maze of random traps and you have to work your way through to find the Green button, how do you do this? Well you have 2 feet don't you? And what goes on feet? Shoes, so you have 2 shoes which you can fling into rooms and if there is a trap then it will activate it, if you spring a less deadly trap then you can quickly run it and grab it before the trap activates, if not and the room gets sealed off then unforunately you're down to 1 shoe. In its current state, and only because of how cheap it is,I would reccommend you check it out but mainly if you're Okay with playing it now for about 15 minutes if you can't get the multiplayer to work since Singleplayer isn't currently very exciting but it shows the concept of what the game is and allows you to get ready for Multiplayer.You can now play multiplayer and it is much more entertaining, especially watching your friends or others run into a trap and get burned alive.I would hope for Multiplayer there would be a way to be the trap setter, sort of like Fable Legends, but of course with rules and limits so you can't encase the players with sealed traps. This would create more unique experiences and would be pretty fun to watch people run about your maze.I would also like to see maybe traps that are sealed but you can get out of so some aren't certain death but it would be hard to get out of, maybe random variations of each trap so you can't tell what to do straight away if you already know how to escape one of them.The game is in the sort of stage that Who's Your Daddy is in where the games concept is there and it functions,Multiplayer apparently does work but like I said it's buggedMultiplayer Works fine!, but there is still a tonne more to be done with the game and if the developer works hard this game could be a very fun Multiplayer game and there's no reason why this won't get more popular over time.I give the game an 8/10 for now in hopes the developer will continue to develop and expand on this great idea, I imagine my review score getting much higher if development goes well. I will update my review when I can and hopefully when big changes are made and also hopefully when the game fully gets released."

,Recommended,434730,28728449,"Posted: 27 December, 2016",all,S1X_BULL3TS,"Good concept, but I can think of a few things that make the game a load of a lot better. My mentality playing this game is to try a room, throw a shoe in, run in really quickly, then run back out. Obviously you can escape any trap successful using this method assuming you have enough shoes. But it would be more fun if the traps don't activate until the doors close so you can't run in real quick to check if it's safe because that's no fun. There would be way more of an adrenaline rush if you are trying to escape if you have to get out once you're locked in. Secondly, there needs to be way more death traps, and there needs to be  traps that you can escape. No I'm not talking about running out of the trap room to escape, I'm talking about escaping the trap while it's in the room with you. That would make the game have much better skill value and less luck. Enemies that follow you should move slower and be able to open doors, set off traps and keep pursuing you until you escape or die. That would make the gameplay very interesting. Finally, I think a game mode of some sort should be added where you need to find pieces of a code to be able to escape. That would give the game a fun strategy aspect. My only other unrelated suggestion would be a wider musical score for the game, because I feel like some emotion is missing from the game that music could fill quite nicely. I like this game, but right now it seems very limited. It's price is lower than the cost of a pudding cup, so don't buy a pudding cup thinking that you will feel as full as you would eating a Thanksgiving dinner.PS: I also wouldn't buy this game if you don't have any friends to play it with, becuase I think it's pretty boring without other people to experience it with you."

In a move inspired by Cube, you can test rooms for traps by throwing a shoe in, but you've only got 2!Some trapped rooms you can pass through, and some are inescapable traps you have to go around.

,Not Recommended,434730,21163166,"Posted: 12 February, 2016",all,Matt,"Please capitalize the first letter of the word 'dead' in the title. It bothers me so much.Half Dead is a game similar to the 1997 film Cube, about a group of survivors navigating their way through a dangerous set of trap rooms. You and your friends are trapped in the maze of rooms, trying to reach the room with the exit, but if you are caught in a room with a trap, you most likely die. However, each player is aided with two shoes, which you can throw into rooms, testing if there is a trap present.At this point, Half Dead hardly counts as a game. Most games follow the same formula: Throw shoe into room, wait for something to happen. If nothing happens, go into room. If something happens, don't go into room and wait until it is same to retrieve your shoe.There's no strategy at all. You throw your shoe into a room and hope it doesn't blow up. From what I can tell, there's no pattern as to which rooms have traps versus which rooms don't. in the film Cube, there was a pattern to which rooms had traps. The graphics are fine, but it gets so laggy on public servers that you can barely get above 10 FPS. Not to mention the lack of traps.Half Dead feels like a really good game that needs to have more variety and be much less random. At this point, I can't recommend it."

Very much in the vein of the film 'Cube'.Behind the Tron style aesthetics is a rather simple game. One where you have a semi-random maze presented to you (with the player or host for multiplayer games choosing parameters for that) and your role is to move through room by room in the grid to find the exit. Each room can potentially be safe, the exit you are seeking or trapped. You can use observation, sheer luck and your most precious of tools - your shoes - to try and make it. By throwing a shoe into a room you can try to trigger traps and then react in a timely fashion to whatever happens - move in if nothing seems to be triggered or run away fast if a trap appears. Sometimes traps are more easily avoidable if you are fast enough, leading to Indiana Jones style moments where you rush past an incroaching laser cutter and grab your shoe on the way through the door.The game is incredibly cheap and so the bar is set lower, of course. Even then this is a game that is very fun if you have strong nerves to handle it in single player and more fun still for a group to join in. The simple mechanics of it will make it easier to get a group together, as will the variable form of the mazes from very small and easy to large and deadly (as well as the option of the maze being different shapes and the layout of the exit and features being in certain patterns or random). Remember, more shoes is always better if you want to survive. As are expendible comrades you can send into a room first once the shoes run out. You can always draw straws for who gets to go first...The controls are very simple and use standard FPS set ups (barring the shoe throwing key which only has a close comrade in the Stalker games where you throw bolts to try to trigger anomalies, its traps). Keyboard and mouse or a controller is optional.A no-regret buy for the majority."

There really isn't anything to this right now after you get the basics.  Only a few traps and it's basically ""throw shoe in, see if trap, if not trap continue, if trap wait it out (unless its a cage trap in which case your shoe is gone and you cant go in that room ever again), find new room"".My impression from the trailer wasn't about shoe testing, but I thought the game (and this is probably my fault) was going to be about surviving skillful and trixy traps (like falling floor tiles, simon says, lazer jump rope), not sacrificing clothing to the death gods until you have to play the virgin.It's fun and funny for a little while, but since it's not much more than random guessing a few quick decisions, it has almost no replay value despite being randomly generated...just too few trap types that (some of which) don't even matter that they are different since you aren't trying to survive them specifically but get them to activate and wait them out or run past them regardless of which trap it is.Non core complaints that will likely be addressed before releaseIt bugs me a little that there is no music slider at the moment.The movement is very weird, though kind of funny how you can even accelerate in the air.Head bobbing trying to make things feel real, but it just makes me feel barfy if the movement is so sudden.I feel like this kind of trappy game would benefit from not being so bright and randomly reflective, so it feels more like a prison than a space station.The sensitivity is not easily tested since it's different in spectator than playing and you have to leave the server to change it.It might be a better move to cover the players face's since honestly...soul patch man and souless woman make the game feel lower quality than a nice looking space helmet which doesn't draw too much attention.I might be able to think of more things, but my friends and I want to play something else now so have a nice day and I hope to see some classy updates for this game."

The setup of trapped rooms that the player nativates by numerical clues, or thrown boots, strongly resembles the movie The Cube. However, the developers have done very well translating this idea into a simple, very playable and replayable format; similarly to minesweeper one can tell how many of the rooms adjacent to the current room are trapped. There are several game formats and difficulty adjustments (such as a map which records trap discovery, or doesn't) so the game offers a fair bit of replay value. Like Minesweeper, however, all the logic in the world is useless against bad luck, which can get frustrating after a while. But in itself a very amusing puzzle game."

I think the concept is pretty cool and really tries to put you in the perspective of these contestants, but it just doesn't seem to maintain the fun factor for very long. The single player mode unfortunately gets dull quickly, because the sense of discovery and exploration ends pretty quickly after you've encountered all of the types of traps. Also, you don't get to interact with others and inform them of possible traps that they might encounter, which personally is what could potentially be the leading drive of this game.This could of course be rectified by simply switching to multiplayer, but I don't think I have (or will ever) see more than 5 online players at a time."

If every toy project of this level made its way to Steam, we'd have a million $2 games to sift through.I can sum up my problems with this game with the following:There's no strategy, no planning, no problem-solving, and no meaningful choices of any kind.You are in a room with doors. You open a door and throw in your shoe. If your shoe is electrocuted or roasted, you are down a shoe and can't go that way. Do this twice, and you're out of shoes. Then just walk through doors at random until you die (usually one or two will do it) or win by dumb luck.There are no choices in the game. If you have friends, (and therefore enough shoes) you never guess, you just spend a shoe on each room. If you don't, you guess, and you have no control whatsoever over whether you die when guessing.This game is JUST BARELY complete enough to appear on Steam, and features mainly off-the-shelf content, textures, and models that were probably assembled in a weekend. I believe it's part of a trend of money-grabbing projects on Steam priced low enough that the person behind it doesn't think people will bother with refunds, and JUST complete enough that people can't claim it's not a game.------Addendum:I've considered the possibility that the room numbers are significant, but factoring them doesn't reveal anything. It is irrelevant anyway. If the room numbers DO reveal which are safe, then you are back to the problem of having no choices. It's the equivalent of labeling every room, leaving you still with no possible decision-making."

If you do not have it on your gamelist start checking your couch for spare change so you can afford this game. In the future though I hope more traps will be added.

Especially the guy that runs in and blows up. I never have to worry about any of those.

First thing is the graphics are pretty decent (I did experience a few frame drops but these weren't as big of a deal), from reflection of the floor to other things surrounding you. Each room has a ""pressure plate"" which has a possibility of being an armed trap. Luckily for you, you have shoes that you can throw to test to see if each room has a trap. I found this to be pretty clever by adding on to the survival element for you have to rely on the two shoes in order to survive. I did find the game to be quite repetitive at times (sometimes boring) for one of the only two things you can do is run and throw shoes (and wish for the best)...As this game is in the early stages, the menu isn't as eye-appealing and it is harder to find multiplayer sessions but don't let those take away from what this game has to offer.Overall...8/10; this game has a lot of potential for its future in its early access stage."

Bacause on singleplayer mode it´s pretty boring after some time spent. The idea itself is neither bad nor innovative, you are just told to go through rooms until you find the ""exit"", which is a green button on the ground... Yea, that´s it. Randomly generated rooms, with or without traps. Starts off pretty interesting but after a while it´s just repetive. Couldn´t play multiplayer so far, it´s probably pretty fun to play with good friends. Although this can be somewhat frustrating I wouldn´t call it a ""challenge"", since the rooms are RANDOMLY PLACED. Sound is allright, only the chainsaw dude is a little annoying.But now for some other aspects:The graphics are pretty neat, at least the VFX. The characters look pretty much awkward against that, asking me. The dying scenes are just hilarious, everytime you die, no matter how, you are just torn into red pieces. On the other hand the surroundings look quite good. And according to this costs 1,99$; it´s a very fair deal, for this price this is absolutely okay. One last thing that disturbs me are the achievements. They look somewhat out of place, they could have been more meaningful. You are just getting them by playing... ""Discover XXX Rooms""; ""Find XXX Traps""... Nothing else.So that´s what I had to admit. If you have some friends to play Half Dead with this will be fun for a few hours, probably not more. If you want some singleplayer action, I would refuse this on your spot. But still, for such a low price you can´t get so wrong."

You don't have to create a story mode; for Christ's sake, it's a puzzle game, most don't. But at least add a background to who you're playing as and why you're there. Also, replace some of the weird traps like the skeletons and chainsaw guys with something a little more interesting? They're cool but they're just really random.Also, I would HIGHLY recommend supporting map creation as well as trap creation. There's 10 items on the workshop and they're just masks....I know this game can do a lot better than it's doing. But for the price tag at the moment (1.99), it's totally worth it.

The gameplay is inherently simple but a fun time when playing with friends. The game has you survive a series of rooms that may or may not be boobie trapped. The enjoyment of the game comes from the chase to the winning point, watching yourself and others around you die, throwing your shoes into a safe room, whilst watching your friends throws theirs into a death trap.

I'd say as much fun as you'd expect from a 2.19$ game but what it lacks in variety it makes up for in concept.Gameplay: You run around rooms which are colour coded to tell you how many traps are around you (if you're colour blind you may have a problem) your objective is to find the exit in a game where moving into a certain room can mean certain death. Of course, there are different kinds of traps, some which you can survive if you move quickly and some which will trap and kill you.Graphics: Think Gmod but slightly flashier, character models are reused a lot but there is a workshop to help fix that. But overall, it's a 2.19$ game. What do you expect?Sound: Eh, music is alright. Not Undertale but not bad.Multiplayer: With the price of this game I was afraid that the lobby system might work on VAC or even worse with that crappy IP thing that Terraria had. But the lobby was easy to set up and even easier to join. No real glitches from the looks of it in the lobby system but of course, this is why I'm not paid to find glitches in games.Overall: If you have 2.19$ and you want a quick cheap game to play with friends then go ahead and buy it. It's fun, it's simplistic, it's good. Keep in mind that it's a 2.19$ and enjoy the change of pace from what most big video games have right now."

You can outsmart the traps (sometimes, it doesn't happen always) by throwing a shoe into them. If they trigger, it's a trap! If they don't it's probably safe, or is it?My main issue is there isn't much meat to it. A game of this caliber being in early access doesn't necessarily work very well, it would if it had a plethora of traps and content in it to begin with, but that's the issue.

Music, there is no damn music which makes it get boring quicker.#2. the ability to troll people by pushing them into rooms to see if there is a trap in there.#3. Character creation, everyone is running around as the bald guy with a soul patch. there is no sense of uniqueness.#4. A Narrator, you are supposed to feel like you are on a T.V. show but you would never know that unless you read the description on the steam page.#5. The ability to control enemies after you die, the enemies you encounter have the worst AI ever and all you have to do is casually walk around them and they even vanish after less than 10 secs so if they could be controlled by a downed player it would spice up the game quite a bit.#6. Hand gestures, i want to be able to flip people off or tell them to come here to lure them into a trap or to give them a thumbs up.#7. More variation of rooms, all the rooms look the same so there is no sense of adventure to opening up a new room#8. Game show Prizes, currently there is no reward for playing the game you just survive and hope you don't die from a trap but if there were prizes like new powersuits, hairstyles, money to spend and sh*t like that it would be a hell of a lot funner and give players a reason to come back and it will feel more like you are on a T.V. show. Because as of right now the game doesn't feel like you are on a T.V. show whatsoever which is one of the reasons i bought the game.#9. A Survival Deathmatch Arena, there is only one multiplayer mode which is just survive the traps. but i want to be able to kill other players with Laser-swords in an arena gladiator style.Everyone is saying that this game is like the movie ""The Cube"" but i was expecting this game to be more like the video game ""Smash T.V."" if the creators of this game were more influenced by the video game ""Smash T.V."" than they were with the movie ""The Cube"" than this game would be one of the coolest games ever.DEVELOPERS OF ""HALF DEAD"" PLAY THE VIDEO GAME ""SMASH T.V."" AND GET INFLUENCE FROM IT YOU GUYS CAN MAKE SOMETHING THAT CAN GO DOWN IN THE HISTORY BOOKS DON'T BE F*CKIN LAZY AND JUST MAKE A FEW CHANGES TO THIS GAME HERE AND THERE READ MY CHANGE LIST AND PLAY THE VIDEO GAME ""SMASH T.V."" YOU GUYS CAN TURN THIS TURD INTO A DIAMOND I CAN SEE THE POTENTIAL I JUST HOPE YOU DEVELOPERS CAN SEE IT TOO."

Okay, but for a buck-fifty, you can't go wrong. Right?Wrong.This is NOT a co-op game... unless you agree with the devs, ""We don't plan to support LAN play.""I don't agree!

Add features like pushing other player into their death!- More traps - These traps are okay, but need more of it and diferent variation to allow player to have a small chance of surviving.- Random blocked door - to get to the other side of the door, they must enter from a different way.- Multiple floors - More of it.- Small hints - not an obvious hint, but hints to make the players analyze the room ahead before entering. Hints that quite hard to identify  (Maybe make it random?).- Destructable shoes - Shoes should be destoryed on the activation of the trap. Maybe some traps doesn't complete destroy the shoe.- Different Model for the player - we need some variety.Im looking forward to what this game has to offer in the future.I recommend this game.

,Recommended,434730,24732236,"Posted: 5 August, 2016",all,CJ,"For this price I can commend it.There really isn't much to the game. It's a set of rooms layed out in a grid pattern, all rooms look the same when you see them the first time. Rooms can have one of several traps: either a no-escape-trap (the doors get blocked off followed by a fatal trap), or a dodge-trap (you can dodge the trap and continue through the room), or a laser-trap (a laser appears in the door, making it unusable for one cycle; the room may contain other traps as well), or there may be one of several enemy spawns, which are all avoided by standing in the corner. The goal is to find the room with the exit panel. To find out if a room has a trap, you can throw your shoes in which trigger all no-escape-traps (making the thrown shoe unobtainable) and some dodge-traps. Each room has a coordinate, a X and Y if you will. The letter makes for the Y position, while the followed number defines the X coordinate. The coordinates are shown in the room in one of several colors, where each color indicates how many traps are in the rooms surrounding the room the coordinate describes.Does this sound familiar? Have you seen the Cube-movies? It's exactly that. There are also some random civilians which clearly have some mental disorder, just like the calculator-guy in the movies. But he serves no purpose in the game, other than amusing and misleading you. If a crazy dude is jumping around in the room it must mean there's no trap in there, right? Wrong. You can see him get covered in lava and acid, and he still continues acting like a chicken. This was actually the most unintuitive part of the game.Once you figure those mechanics out it's a mix of Minesweeper and coin flipping. Once you've lost both your shoes in no-escape-traps, you have to guess which other rooms are no-escape or dodge traps. This part of the game sucks, since it comes down to luck. In the easier difficulties you can mostly win the game by doing the Minesweeper logic, but in the hard difficulty this won't cut it. You can obtain shoes from a random enemy spawn which is some terrorist blowing himself up and dropping a shoe, or when another player who had a shoe dies. That's it for mechanics. After about an hour you start developing a workflow to scan the rooms in a fast manner. I'm sorry to say that at this point the game won't have much more to offer, neither in gameplay nor in content.The best part about it is the multiplayer. That is because it's fun to coordinate your approaches, even though they're very minimalistic.I had fun for little over 2 hours with a friend, and I really don't ask more of a 2€ game. If you have nobody to play it with I don't recommend it, but if you've got some friends with some bucks to throw away, this is worth it in my opinion."
,Recommended,434730,24783576,"Posted: 8 August, 2016",all,Internet Pedant,"Production quality: approximately zero. Identikit rooms, placeholder character models, basic special effects.Now that the irrelevant stuff is out of the way, let's get to why you should buy this.See, here's the thing; it's OK to skimp on the visuals if the core game is good. And good doesn't have to mean complex or deep. Half Dead isn't attractive. It isn't complicated. What it is, is a simple idea executed well; you're stuck in a trapped maze with some other players, and have to try and survive and escape (usually against the clock).The first couple of rounds, we played on Easy, and... it was easy! We quickly got used to the routine; open a door, stand aside in case of flamethrower or freezeray, toss in a boot, then ease in to make sure it's safe. Wander round, find the exit, all done!Then we whacked difficulty to normal, bumped the room size up a bit, and reduced the time a bit.Oh boy. Forget staying together; the inevitable frantic run from a chainsaw guy puts paid to that idea. Although we probably wouldn't if we could; there's too little time now, we need to cover more ground. Damn, that room had a trap, down to one boot. Now that one did too; down to zero. Hang on, my friend died a couple of rooms East of here... if I can get there, I can take his.It works. There's enough randomness that bad stuff does happen, but enough strategy that it doesn't happen too often. You'll die far more of carelessness... or panicked running... than you will of cheap unavoidable insta-gibs. The matches are short enough that the sting doesn't last long, and you can carry on as an advisor for your friend, frankly yelling at them to run into the room with the shadow monster, because you just saw the trap appear in the room behind them that they haven't noticed yet.One thing we hadn't picked up one was the minesweeper element; I saw a loading screen tip that said something about room colours, but didn't have time to read it fully. Next time, we'll be ready.Put aside the stock visuals, asset reuse, and relatively narrow scope of the game. For a couple of quid, this is well worth your money; get together with a few friends, die hilariously, learn, improve... and enjoy."

That is why this is probably my favorite game I've played on that show so far and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to feel that same level of tension yet hilarity that ensues with each attempt to beat it."

,Recommended,434730,33618327,Posted: 17 July,all,lanvilus,"For the price, this game is amazing. It's simple and one-dimensional, but if you know that going in, there won't be any surprises. After all, if you pay a dollar for a game, don't expect it to be rich in storyline or even have smooth and bug-free gameplay.That being said, for the price, the quality is outstanding. I haven't encountered any bugs in 5 hours of game play. I've played both single player and online multiplayer, and solo play is great to learn the game (which is basically WASD movement, E to open doors and pick up items, and shift to run - simple controls) while one-winner multiplayer takes the cake as best game mode, as it is a race to be the first to find the exit.Definitely best to play with friends, even if just for a half hour or so. It's so cheap that you could buy copies for 4-5 friends and still pay less than $10 (I bought it on sale, but even without a sale, it's what? $2?).I see all of these reviews claiming the servers are down permanently, but that must be in select areas because I was able to play online with a couple of random people (I'm a U.S. resident). Also, you can make private matches if you don't want to play with random shmoes.Generally speaking, if I get at least one hour of enjoyable gameplay per dollar spent, that qualifies as a good buy to me. I may go buy a few copies for friends."

,Recommended,434730,33258537,Posted: 4 July,all,sorinmarkovi,"A few months ago, I'd have suggested this game. It was a BUNCH of fun with friends, a really stupid and buggy game that brought out laughter from everyone.That being said, It was ONLY fun with friends. The servers are now down, and there is  little to do with this game. It isn't worth this anymore. Steer clear of this, and save yourself a buck or two. Go buy something better.Hopefully the servers come back up someday, but it's very unlikely.Edit: 7/25/2017 - As of now, the multiplayer is enabled again, and they've added another mode. I would suggest it now because it's worth it to play ONLY in a friend environment. This isn't a good single player game. The more friends with this, the better it is."

76561198316093699,Recommended,434730,34407302,Posted: 21 August,all,Ryko,"I played this game many months ago. It definitely has some GREAT potential... one of the few issues I had with it at the time was... there was no background music... just an eerie silence. Also, the traps became too predictible, and there should be more monsters. Some monsters should be able to travel through the doors. Like... for example... a mechanicle monster that you can hear it walking a room or two away...... slow metal clanks... and it can walk through the doors like you can. If it finds you, it sounds a scary alarm sound or screech meant to scare the Sh&t outta you, then it picks up the pace to chase you.... and you have to tire it out.. like it'll eventually overheat or something.. making it stop and spark a little, giving you time to escape.. all while avoiding the standard traps.I really wasn't a fan of the instant death doors..... especially since there is no respawn. It really bugged me when I would start a game and get insti-killed at the beginning... then it would be like.. 10 mins before I could play again. My solution would be to encorporate a Re-spawn system. Either time, or the living players would have to activate or trigger something to cause a respawn of fallen comrads.Other than that.... I really like the system of the gameplay..... and I think if you guys keep working on it... you have the potential for a very high-quality suspense game!"

I have intel graphics 620 and I cannot run a lot of games as well as I can with this. With everything on it's maximum setting, that is saying something. Even if I were to run everything on minimal the graphics are still phenominal, mostly because of the reflections. Yes, the door closing time could be made a tad bit longer, but all and all, this is a quality game especially for the price. I look foward to see what you release in the future, Room710."
