While scenes in the game might seem a bit weird, even foreign to the non-native eye, ja, I assure you over here in the land of das Kraut, das ist okay!Usually I don't feel das Bedürfnis to write ein Review, but there have been so much misconceptions about German culture and history and as this game is trying to broaden international understanding, we Übermenschen would be the last to not follow the Zeitgeist of Videospiels and educate all the Völker.Here mein Urteil:While it might be bland and boring, as the daily life simulation it is, it really does capture the feeling of ordinary monday in mid fall. 9/10"

Unfortunately the mouse aiming feels very clunky, which was a deal breaker for me as the levels get more and more frenetic and it's frustrating to die over and over just because it's so hard to aim right. Should they improve this in future patches, I'd definitely recommend the game. Right now, it's a pass for me."

76561197988091166,Recommended,434740,34804389,Posted: 7 September,all,Astyanax,"A quirky 2D-artillery game.Your dude jogs to a spot which is then overrun by nasties.Your objective is to kill those wierdos by throwing your speer, using mostly angle-mastery as well as some minor special powers managment to fend them off.Repeat this a couple of times and one of about a dozen levels is over.Depending on how well your spear chuckery went, you get more or less shekels to spend on unlocking a few extras that function as a form of loadout.There are boss monsters. And they are surprisingly well-made.Rare enough, these days.General game-depth is okay. Perfecting shots and playthrough speed will take some time. There's not a whole of loadouts, however.You should definitely like the genre or the idea of chasing the perfect shot, over and over.Graphics are fine, music is passable, if unremarkable.The difficulty is medium high, so you will die but it's rather fair.One aspect stinks mightily, however. The last two levels feature obstacles that obstruct your view needlessly. It's hard to determine what's actually going on. A few times this is unintended, like when a disco lightshow tries to give you epilepsy with an Umlaut- bad enough. Later, this is even part of the design - very questionable for a game that relies on perfect angles and split seconds. Strike one, Lichtspeer!The game passes nontheless,It's simply uncomplicated fun for the most part without much ballast.Verdict:Straight as a Lichtarrow, easy to play..Three out of five Strudel have been tossed into the air.Nice."

But man, oh man was I wrong. There's something to Lichtspeer that you won't see looking at screenshots or trailers, it's like a smooth, buttery, addictive juice with just a pinch of LSD - you have to try it to understand it.In the end I found it to be an amazing experience, will probably be my go to timekiller for the foreseeable future (also good for relieving work related stress!)."

It's very challenging at first but onve you get used to it - you want to keep going and get through new levels. Ze-German twist is also very funny! Defnitely recommended!! For this price - it's a steal. Go and have a strutzel.

Lichtspeer is a fancy looking game with some hipster attitude, but ultimately it just plays like one of those mediocre flash games you might remember from earlier times...Yes, it is funny and entertaining at first but it turns out to be repetitive and frustating very soon.You can upgrade your abilities between levels, which is a plus, but the game mechanics are still very limited (you can't even move your character around). Lichtspeer feels like a game that belongs in the mobile gaming sector, it just doesn't offer enough to be a full-fledged PC game to be released on Steam.Although it seems to be decently coded, there are still some flaws I'd like to mention.The thing that stressed me out most is that the trajectory indicators are white triangles with some darkish outlines, however, a big portion of the game is going on on very bright backgrounds, so the trajectory of your spear can be very hard to determine.The fact that you cannot disable screen shaking (yet) increases the frustration when you've died the 30st time because you couldn't make out in which direction you're actually aiming.Yeah the soundtrack is not bad, but it's not as awesome as in Hotline Miami, either...(Since you will have to hear the same track over and over again, due to dying a lot, it tended to even go on my nerves at some point.)Maybe I wouldn't be so disappointed if I hadn't paid 10bucks for the game. 2bucks would seem way more reasonible, considering how little you get for you money.Sorry, cannot recommend, even if it comes with strudel...."

76561197989528524,Not Recommended,434740,25772023,"Posted: 29 September, 2016",all,Dragon,"Lichtspeer starts off as a whole lot of fun.  If you're willing to spend an hour, maybe an hour and a half, on it then buy it, play it, move on.  You'll not regret it.To start you'll be a licht throwing god.  Three, five, seven headhost combos.  You'll be rattling off spears like lightning and feel like the god of thunder.  It's a complete blast and chasing those high scores couldn't have been more fun.However if you play up to the Zoculus (I forget it's name) then things start turning sour.  The number of you're-dead-if-you-miss situations multiply and the stages get longer.  The gameplay becomes shallow and repetitive and replaying stages becomes a chore.And the controls are (intentionally?) broken.  You aim with the mouse cursor but the cursor is invisible.  Turning around consitently is a pain because you can't tell at what point the cursor will move over the character and cause them to flip.  It's no longer skill-based hard, it's a random death slog.  I think the same problem exists when throwing spears near the ceiling.  Sometimes aiming is quick (when the cursor is near the character); but sometimes the aim trajectory barely moves at all making the tricky dead-if-you miss shots frustrating beyond words.By the time I'd gotten to the Executive Golem I wasn't enjoying myself at all.Which brings me to the problem with all the boss fights.  Your special powers are taken away.  I can't see that they would have made boss fights easy but they would have removed the frustration of one small slip being insta-death.  Those special powers need quite a lot of grinding to get and taking them away when they'd be most needed really twists the knife in your wasted time.I've also got a couple of small gripes around the character's death.  Either the character's hitbox is bigger than I expected or there is some sort of lag before death.  Many times I've felt I've activated a shield or thrown a spear but nothing happens, time passes, then the player dies.  A slight nuisance compounded by the very lackluste death sequence: generally a wurst zombie standing quietly next to your fallen body as the muzak keeps playing.  Meh.My biggest issue - and what prompted this review - is Lichtspeer's achievments.  One in particular.  Play for 100 hours.  That's not an achievement, that's just leaving the process running and making me do marketing for free for Lichthund.  If I did this my then not only would Lichtspeer turn up as one of my most played games, it would also intrigue my friends into wondering why I was in-game so much.  Both would be false impressions.And the time based achievements don't work anway so it would all be for nothing.Lichtspeer ultimately feels like a flash game that has overstayed it's welcome.  The more I play the more deficient it feels.  Get it on sale or on a mobile device (if the aiming is easier) but be warned it's rage inducing and not in a Dark Souls way."

The enemy patterns are varied between types and the special powers have different styles for different players. It's very absorbing.There are two main issues that haunt the game, however. The first is the lack of any kind of ability to save the game at a stage point. Obviously with this kind of score attack game you don't want to be able to have more than one save game, and  consume it on load, but it means the playtime for a level can vary from ten minutes to forty, and that can be a problem.The second and much bigger problem are the boss fights. They remove all your powers and make you learn a series of attacks to get through them. This usually ends up cycling between modes of attack, and getting reset aaaaall the way back to the start of the boss if you die. This is INCREDIBLY frustrating as they ramp up the bosses to more and more ridiculous heights, to the stupidity of the DJ fight, where you literally have to launch a spear at the exact right second and angle to get between obstacles... just to not die and have a chance at causing the boss some damage.Because you don't get your powers you can't use zuper time to bullet time it perfectly. I get why the damaging powers shouldn't be allowed, but other ways to make them achievable would have been good.Overall I would vote mixed on this if I could, the early game and late game outside the bosses is pretty good"

Ever visited ""Jayisgames"", there you find lots of free Indie and flash games as well as recommendations for non-free games. Over the years I played dozens of pretty funny and nice flash games with a pretty similiar gaming concept as ""Lichtspeer""; killing Zombies, destroying Castles etc. Lichtspeer has interesting grafics, the humour is great etc. But the gameplay is (of course) very repetive and nothing special or innovative at all. It's a game you play here and then for some minutes. I've bought it and I won't ask for a refund, because it was pretty obvious, what I would get. I only expected to have more fun!The game just speeds up the enemies, who are pretty similiar most of the time, and that's what changes from level to level. You, standing there, expecting hordes of enemies that are getting faster. There would have been much room for many, many little gags and ideas that wasn't used. So you have the graphics that blow you away, but only for a second. Apart from that you have no innovation at all."
