With multiple enemies, it can take what seems like 20-30 seconds of waiting for moving one tile.  It's a waste of your time.  I'm a traditional roguelike player and have never seen such a poorly implemented AI animation/movement sequence.The game looks beautiful, has some interesting language mechanics.  It's a shame the slow AI turns make it not worth the wait."

Once you move, EVERY SINGLE ENEMY moves singularly, and slowly for that matter. This problem is so prevalent that I could not continue playing this game. In these regards, I cannot recommend this game."

The entire game is controlled by mouse. If you like to play with keyboard or gamepad: Nope, not working. The ""no text"" gimmick is kinda interesting, since you have to figure out yourself what the stats and symbols mean, but the fun is killed quickly when the game pace is extremely slow.Also, the music is mediocre at best."

Unlike the other popular rougelikes, you cannot sit idle and farm like crazy in this game. You have an urgency to get to the end of the level before long or bad things happen to you, which I enjoy. I have not played too much at this point but from what I have seen, the weapon/armor sets are exactly the same in every playthrough. This is not a bad thing however, as the game presents you with a lot of items with drastically different effects. And the ability to change items/weapons/armors at will once you get them, creates an amazing utility that doesn't exist anywhere else.While I believe the game can be further improved with the addition of randomness to the enemy spawn and other small fine tunings, the game at this point is fully fleshed out and complete.As for the price, I think 9 dollars is more than fair for this game. It offers numerous replayability options and probably over 50 hours of gameplay before being any kind of bored. Which better than anything I can say for the most A+ titles.Buy it, no brainer."

With no item descriptions to guide you and no text in the UI, your first couple of runs will just be figuring out what you can and can't do. Your next few runs will be trying to figure out the various pieces of clothing and equipment that you'll find strewn around the pyramid and why those nasty big critters start chasing youfor taking to long. Then finally you'll be making the most of what you have learnt to try and push deeper into the underground to inevitably die at the hands of a newly encountered enemy type.It's this learning process that will either keep you playing for the first 2 hours or put you off of the game.

,Recommended,434880,21020407,"Posted: 7 February, 2016",all,Sheesh,"This is a quite clever and enjoyable game that I see as a slow-paced puzzle rogue-like (turn-based, procedural levels, random loot, permadeath).The premise: you walk from left to right, killing things, avoiding traps and looting other things until you go down the stairs at the far right and the difficulty ramps up.Everything happens in turns, order is determined by a speed stat that mainly depends on your equipped gear, and traps give a tell before they go off.The puzzle aspects start to come in to play when you find loot and try to figure out 'what does it do actually?'All aspects of your gear are visualized as pictograms and while you get all information about its effects, you have to figure out what these pictograms mean in the first place (which isn't that hard if you experiment a bit when you find something new to you).Examples: a new dress may restrict your movement to the 4 cardinal directions instead of the usual 8, but boost your speed and defence and further increase your speed when you stand in sand tiles instead of reducing it. Headgear may reduce or nullify a certain damage type / effect while making you more vulnerable to another type. With the new weapon you may be unable to attack now and then due to cooldowns, but it extends your reach and hit chance while dealing a damage type this particular enemy is weak against... and so on.While often things feel at first like flat upgrades to your ability to deal damage or get faster, you will come into situations where you'll have to skip some turns to swap items (each equipment change takes one turn, and spells and such start with cooldowns when freshly equipped) - and that along to changing your own movement or attack patterns give it a surprising amount of depth.Enemies come with abilities as well and may push you around (beware of holes in the floor after the first few levels), freeze or poison you and generally keep you on your toes since new enemies are introduced every level so far (made it past lvl 5 of 9).Just to extend on what kinds of things you have to keep in your mind:- your general stats: life, speed, defence, attack strength and hitchance- attack pattern of your normal and special attacks, damage type, additional effects when attacking, attack cooldowns- spell effects, patterns, cooldowns- your and your enemies resistances and vulnerabilities- traps, their types and patterns, and with your current speed, will you make it past them in time - or can you even use them against your foes- your own movement pattern (may need to change your suit to get out of a dead end)- and also how you deal with +/- health ... uhm... flying things(?); your shield may reverse their effects for exampleAs for the graphics: Just look at the screenshots and form your own opinion. Npc/trap turns take a few seconds so it's a bit slow going but the important part is that you can always tell what is going on - it could lose its readability if sped up further.Equipped gear is always represented on your character sprite which is nice, but there are no animations bar some 'swoosh' lines when attacks are dealt.Also, a codex of some sort would be nice where you could unlock a view (with the same pictograms) of what you are up against, so far it's all about observing and memorizing and quite some guesswork - which isn't bad per se, but e.g. after I've killed the same bugger 20 times it would be nice to take a closer look into his actual stats.Can't comment on technical stuff, I've experienced no problems like crashes at all. *edit: about half an hour minutes after writing this it crashed for the first time. Well... *edit2: and an update that specifically targets that crash came within one hour. On a sunday.It's good."

Being a roguelike game, there are obviously frustrating moments, like getting to level four only to discover that apparently some enemies can blast you against the wall at nearly full health and insta kill you.  Well, FTL and Don't Starve have those moments too, but at least they don't seem as slow as this game.I don't have a problem with turn based games--original XCOM is one of my favorie games, and some of those turns can be quite long.  The problem here is, that it just isn't as fun for me.  This isn't really objective, as some reviewers don't mind it.  What I really find frustrating is that when you loot sarcophagi it can take you a full turn to equip the item, unless it's the first item.  For example, if you loot a shield and you didn't have one before, it's automatically equipped.  If you already had a shield, you now have to choose to spend a whole turn equipping it.  The problem is the turn based system for this game.  It's the whole design.  It seems to be built around initiative, so you get our speed up and it seems you get more turns, but it still just takes way too long.I really like all the different equipment and spells you can get: armor, helmets, amulets, defensive/offensive spells, and weapons.  Probably my favorite spell is the vampire spell which allows you to take half an enemie's life.There is a lot of thought put into this game, for sure, and I do enjoy trying to figure out the mechanics myself.   Some enemies you kill will turn into white bat-like creatures that you can heal yourself with, or they may heal or kill certain enemies.  There are also black bat-like creatures that can heal or harm you and enemies.  There are certain conditions for that which you have to figure out.  You can knock enemies into walls, each other, and various items and have completely different reactions.  It can be quite dangerous figuring out what new spells do, as they can hurt you.  There are different kinds of traps: acid/gas, fire, freeze, spikes, etc. and each level is random.  There are a lot of different things going on each turn, and you can't stick around too long in the levels as enemies spawn in from the left, and you really don't want to face all of them.I like a lot of things about this game, but it's just so slow.  I may play it again, but I really can't recommend it, because I know a lot of people aren't going to like this aspect."

There is no text to read in the game so lots of the spells and abilities are quite cryptic, which I love, as in many of my favorite Rogue-like games, you learn by doing so to learn the effects of each spell you must cast it. I still need to sink lots of time into this game but am enjoying it so far. My only problem is that the game is not random enough at the begining, sure each playthrough offers a new randomly generated dungeon but the character is always the same, and in a game that has no discernable story I found that bugged me a little bit. I would highly recomend this game to those looking for another Rogue-like experiance."
,Recommended,434880,21296556,"Posted: 18 February, 2016",all,Vinrafel,"First Impression video:https://youtu.be/etjUJi1M0AEThis is one of those situations were I would prefer something between a thumbsup and a thumbsdown. Hieroglyphica is a really cool idea that has some serious flaws in the gameplay.Hieroglyphica is a game with no text (except for the title, I guess they needed that one). Everything you do, and everything that you pick up, is described through pictures. The player has to interpret what every new item does and, in combat, hope that they get it right.The gameplay itself is a rouge-like turn based strategy game. You explore and loot the dungeon while being threatened by traps, monsters, and the demons coming up from behind you (they're the rebel fleet mechanic you can see in FTL. They force you forward). Every turn you get to either move or act. Acting can include attacking, looting a chest, or getting ready to block.Issues:Now, the most glaring problem occurs with one particular type of enemy. I've never made it past the third floor, because there is an enemy there that can perpetually stun lock you. You can do nothing but hope that the enemies attacks miss and you'll be allowed to do something. This is frustrating at best, it made me want to throw my computer from the ISS at worst.Another issue comes in the damage system. You start with 99 health. Even the weakest enemies can easily do 10 damage to you. More powerful enemies (on the second floor, so take ""powerful"" with a grain of salt) can do a quarter of your health worth of damage in a turn. You're limited actions mean that you either have to accept eating damage to try to run, or your locked into combat.The map is also absolutely jam packed with traps. This one is not so bad as the previous issues, but I thought it was very annoying. The traps are so plentiful that it feels like none of the map is safe. You can usually get a warning that traps will fire next turn, unless an enemy steps on a pressure plate and sets them all off. This makes combat really hard to pull off, especially against enemies with multiple action. Yep, those are things.Well, it might sound like I hate this game, but I actually liked it quite a bit. It just has some flaws that prevented me from really loving the game. If you have a hankering for innovative mechanics and incredibly punishing (often unfair) mechanics, then go for it. If not, pass it up, by all means."

The fact that there are nothing written adds depth to the gameplay and makes you feel you're discovering/identifying the items and enemies you encounter. However, once I will figure out all of them I wonder if the game will have the same appeal. I have been playing roguelikes for more than 10 years and yet to complete any of the traditional ones. With Hieroglyphika, on the other hand I have figgured out about 80% of the items/enemies and I have won on normal mode only in my 5th run. So I am not sure if it has the replay value of a traditional rogulike. Some extra content, items and ui improvements would be great. But it is still worth its price, especially when it is in discount."
,Recommended,434880,25313065,"Posted: 2 September, 2016",all,quietscribe,"I like this game a lot, it is challenging and fun, but I have found it disheartening at deeper levels.It seems like the game is balanced with three things in mind:1. Player Knowledge2. Strategy3. Random chance on lootWith the game being permadeath, and loot drops being random out of a wide selection, it can actually depend a lot on the loot as to how far you get in the game.  If you don't have the right armour, or abilities to counteract some enemies, you are at a vast disadvantage no matter how skilled you are.  The only knowledge-gain players get for playing better is a mouse-over description of one mob for each level you have completed in the dungeon, and that doesn't really give you as great as advantage as you might think.Even the strategy is a little problematic, for while it is possible to work your way around mobs, you are basically against an invisible timer before really harder mobs start constantly spawning at the start of the level and coming towards you.  It is possible to kill them, but because they keep spawning, you are basically encouraged to just avoid them completely and rush through.  These rear-spawning mobs don't ever even seem to drop loot either.  A careful person, in another game, might use time to eat away at the different mobs in the dungeon until there was a safe route, but because of this invisible timer of these mobs spawning, that really isn't an option, and so it cuts out that sort of strategy.Due to these things, I found that I was losing the will to really keep trying with the game.  The last 6 plays or so I have got down to level 6, but never past it, and my skill as a player, combined with the random chance of loot means that it doesn't really leave me feeling I will be in any better a chance next play-through.  This has left me, while pleased enough with the game, likely to uninstall it because while I enjoy it, I don't like feeling I am just going to be spending hours without any real improvement.  There isn't really much I can learn about the mobs further that will improve my chances.So yeah, while I recommend the game, it isn't going to be for everyone due to the limits the game imposes on players to create the difficulty.  Some people will adore it for this difficulty, but others, like myself, will just get frustrated."

The disconnect may be an element of the rouge-like crowd expecting a fast twist game like Spelulky- a great game but so is Hieroglyphia which has elements of both turn-based strategy and the rouge-like.Slow down and think rather than react for once- pay attension and observe the monster moves to have a  slim chance to learn more of hieroglyphics before your exploror's career is abruptly terminated once more. The game pace moves along just fine. It difficult but but not unconquerable. It is mentally challeging yet refreshing rather than taxing because there is great depth within its simplicity.

Suits for a slowpoke like me. Could have the ""field of view"" for enemies though, player should not see the map so far behind so many obstacles, but that could raise the difficulty. Still would like to see a toggle of this feature."
