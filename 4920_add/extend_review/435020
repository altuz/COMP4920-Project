When you play the game it still uses the Xbox controls, So to select a captain you have to use RB. To go back you have to press ESC even though it said you have to press B, etc. Don't bother buying untill they have fixed these bugs and also, the keyboard doesnt register 100% of the time. I had to press enter 13 times just for the game to register i pressed the button. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNTIL THEY FIX THESE THINGS!"

I might be more forgivingBut, reality is, it's the only AFL game out there so Supply & Demand forces your hand.In all honesty, if this was Basketball, Soccer, or any other global sport, then this level of game would struggle to achieve any sales at all.AI is ""average"" and ""unimaginative"" at best.Camera angles are difficult to use effectively, and the default camera angle is ridiculousOn the positive, Kicking for goal is an interesting mechanism which reminds me of old-school arcade golf games. I liked that bit."

I created my character, a 28 year old 5'7"" Right Half Forward playing with Gippsland Power in the Under 18s TAC cup.A few games in, and everything was feeling too easy, the controls were getting pretty intuitive. Bump up to medium difficulty, and that seems to be decent, yet still easy enough to learn for now.Eventually, we win the Cup, my character wins Goal Kick, Best & Fairest and the Morrish Medal. A 28 year old kicking♥♥♥♥♥against under 18s.Being impressed by my character's ability to beat kids, Greater Western Sydney offer me a 1 year contract which I accept.I play my first game in the big league. I notice that everything is much faster, running, kicking movement, everything has turned up to 11!Regardless, I gather 20 disposals and kick 5 goals.""All in all, so far AFL Evolution is streets ahead of any previous AFL game, a lot of new features have been added and gameplay has improved.Is this as polished a NBA 2k or FIFA? No. There is definely things that could be improved on, but I think considering the budget and experience those two franchises have compared to AFL Evolution, this is a decent crack at creating a decent game for our great National sport.Do I recommend? For AFL fans, yes. This improved upon everything AFL Live had, and adds so much more.For non-AFL fans, it's hard to recommend this for it's full price, when there's more polished games for cheaper.I bought it because I love AFL, and want to support the developers and hope their next iteration is even better."
,Not Recommended,435020,33761063,Posted: 24 July,all,Aetos,If you go in expecting AFL 98-2005 level gameplay then you might enjoy. I just cannot recommend at full price.The game features far to many bugs. There's really no actual physics in this game. There's no feeling of momentum or impact. Pc support is lacking cannot even find a option for vsync or AA.Ontop of that the game can lag at points even while meeting system requirements. The player faces are great although overall presentation should run better for what the game looks like.I've refunded and may pick it up in future on a special.
,Recommended,435020,33823675,Posted: 26 July,all,Shadey Productions,"TL;DR - 100% buy if you like AFL, if you don't like it then refund it.I bought this game having grown up and loved AFL. While it is not the most perfect game thanks to quite honestly crap game production as it's an Australian game developer, it is still a worthwile buy IF you can get past a few of the issues within it.1 issue being the responsivness in the menus, it takes a few hits of what button you're clicking to actually get recognised by the game, thankfully it doesn't affect gameplay as far as I can tell.I haven't had many issues within the actual gameplay portion itself (which is the main thing) but it seems from other reviews, they have some issues which can probably fixed in a patch.Bottom line really is that if you are a MASSIVE supporter of AFL then you should definitely pick this version up (considering it's the cheapest version) and if you don't like it within 2 hours of in game time, refund through Steam.I personally think it is a good game and if the developers and AFL are planning on collaborating again, then this is a good start and hopefully a lot of the issues can be fixed in later releases."

For a game that has issues and bugs - that is outrageous.Had it been $29.99USD. I wouldn't have opted for a refund.I want to come back and play but only when the issues and the price are fixed."
,Recommended,435020,33692499,Posted: 21 July,all,Zara Larsson,"On first glance on opening the game i questioned the graphics as they weren't great, but over time I passed it and learned to enjoy the actual game and fun of playing this. There are things which should be fixed such as marking which I believe is sided towards the AI but overall a good game if you want to have fun, not care about graphics. Maybe 50usd is a bit steep but when it goes on sale its worth it"
76561198083686313,Not Recommended,435020,33825419,Posted: 26 July,all,Wyndo7,"I cannot recommend this game at this price. Which is a shame because I *really* wanted to give this game every chance. I heard the complaints of the console players (I had friends who traded the disc back in after three days - it was that bad), and waited two and a half months for the PC version to come out (with patches) so I could give it a go.What I've experienced so far has confirmed the bad news. This just isn't a very good game, unfortunately.NEGATIVES:- Gameplay is clunky, rigid, and incredibly repetitive (especially in career mode).- Like previous titles, the gameplay is just kick, mark, tackle, kick, mark, tackle... with the odd free kick here and there.- The difficulty jump from easy to medium is insane. On easy with 5 minute quarters, I win by 10+ goals with ease. On medium, I'm lucky to even score anything.- Graphics, while not important, are lacklustre here.- Commentary is great for the first five minutes, after which you will hear the same thing over and over. Richardson's fake inspirational dribble at the beginning of every quarter is incredibly cringey.- No drills/controls advice in free roam. You have to search through the controls menu yourself to learn how to play the game.POSITIVES:- The facescanned players look fantastic on the players hub. Though why did they bother scanning every player if they only used the results on the 5-6 star players of each team?- The stadiums look pretty nice, I played a twilight game at Metricon Stadium and the sunset effect was glorious.- The Bont is on the front cover.I know this game was made on a low budget. I know that an AFL game can never ever reach the levels of a FIFA or NBA game. I know the sport itself is tricky to translate into a video game. But what is on offer here is just not good enough. If this is the best they can manage after so long, then I really doubt we'll ever see a good quality AFL video game.Save your money. Pick it up if it ever goes on sale if you're absolutely desperate."
,Recommended,435020,33851847,Posted: 28 July,all,XfactorAUS,"I knew about the game months ago and was anticipating the pc release. I have played the Xbox One version for over 200 hours since May 5. Since release it seems to have many supporters and many that dislike it, and the tradition has continued over the past week with the release on Steam.  I appreciate the game for what it is, it allows me to play football. It requires a bit of patience to learn the nuances. People complain about the marking mechanics.......... I got the hang of it over time (yet I still can stuff up on occasion!!). I got the hang of the game pretty quickly, to the point where Legend RARELY poses a challenge for me (I have to ""stop"" trying, in order to let the AI score, so I have something to compete against) 10+ goal thrashings are common.I had a few teething problems installing the game and was almost going to refund it. Came back to it a few days later and it miraculously worked. Much to my delight as I was correct in my prediction that the pc version would be the ultimate version of the game. The difference with the frame rate from console to pc is mind blowing, I love how smoother it is during matches.Bottom line: This is the best AFL game since Aussie Rules Footy on the NES."

76561198026127563,Not Recommended,435020,33833606,Posted: 27 July,all,Wyze,"Is console game, retro-fitted to play on PC. Little computer control capability, really desires a console type controller. Keyboard doesn't recognise all key-presses which makes even navigating the menues frustrating.Game itself is buggy, computer takes control of player on some occasions and runs your player away from the action in contested ball scenarios.Testing the stats in Pro Career mode showed the stats aren't scaled and having the cpu play as your player with max 99 stats - he will still lose constantly, make stupid decisions and get out-played by all players in all positions. Playing as the player showed no notable differences between 50 stats and 99 stats.I played a few hours of this game (though some of it were idle as I left it running during the day) and couldn't get a handle on the game at all. Controls are crap, game seems very clunky and not terribly responsive with the keyboard. Wouldn't recommend.I understand that the game is the best AFL game to date (But that isn't really that much of an acheivement), For $50, it simply isn't worth it, it reeks of a bargain basement game of about $11.99 or so (atleast for PC - consoles may be different?)Furthermore, the nicknames are bugged. All the nicknames I tested were something completely different in the game."

,Recommended,435020,33701386,Posted: 21 July,all,4aron,"I really wanted to like this game when it was first announced. But I did not make the mistake of setting my expectations too high. Anyone who has played any previous AFL game knows that we have never truly had a decent game to really sink our teeth into.So, do I like it? Yes.It it what I was expecting? Actually better.Are the graphics state of the art? Nope, room for improvement but it gets the job done.So is this a game that you can sink your teeth into? I think so, yes. I think this game captures the AFL spirit and complements that with some decent gameplay.PROS- Decent gameplay!- Being able to evade other players when you have the ball.- Career mode- Season mode- Coach mode seems promising (I am yet to try this mode)- Good detail in player creation- Tribunal & awards- Commentary - Does not have BT!- Multiplayer and online play!- Did I mention the gameplay is actually decent?CONS- Just like real life, the umpiring.- Certain game mechanics/physics (sometimes the ball goes through the post, or just misses it but is counted as a point)- If you are clearly kicking to a player along the boundry and the opposition bumps that player away from the ball and the ball goes out of bounds, the Umpire calls 'deliberate'. Every.Single.Time! (Could also be a PRO)- Graphics (For the eye candy ""gamers"")- Commentary. Richo is as dull and boring as he is in real life. No personality and never really has anything positive to say!Ok, so overall this game is not perfect. But it is FUN. Hopefully the developers focus on keeping this game updated and listening to the fans. This game is a massive improvement from AFL Live 1 and AFL Live 2 (The worst in my opinion).Look, if you are expecting FIFA style mechanics or graphics then you will be disappointed. This game gets the job done for now. It's worth a fair crack."

If you get it expecting EA Sports Madden graphics, gameplay, and commentary, you will be let down.  It's not on par at all with EA Sports.That being said, it is a comprehensive game, with the AFL, AFLW, VFL, and TAC Cup teams, along with all the great footy venues around Victoria and Australia. It is a fun game to play once you learn the controls and timing of the AI, but you will experience some blow out scores when you first start.  Keep practicing and you will get better!All the rules are there, although not equitably applied to the player vs. the AI.  The AI will never get called for ""holding the ball"", and the player will never get ""no prior opportunity"".  You just have to dispose to a teammate because getting tackled is a turnover, which isn't necessarily how the game works in real life.  As mentioned by other reviews, the play-by-play commentary is abysmal.  That is something the developers need to improve drastically before they make the next version of this game.I'm a massive footy fan, so I enjoy being able to play as my favorite AFL or VFL club.  If you're a footy fan, you will enjoy this more than you won't."
