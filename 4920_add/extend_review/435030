It's fun as a time-killer.Downside is the xp required between levels is pretty big (progress in the game requires a certain level to go further), so you'll be grinding for a while. Unless...which brings me to the next point. It's a pay-to-win game so it's engineered to get you to go to the cash shop. I'd with these FTP developers would try to strike a balance between a  the cash grind and a fun game. Maybe charge a small fee up front then have the gash shop less annoying.Overall, it's an OK game. I'd recommend it if you only play a few hours a day."

,Recommended,435030,30000712,Posted: 17 February,all,Areishia01,It's a nice mahjong game but it can also be a bit frustrating at times when you do a zone for a specific item but the game decides to give you something else...

,Recommended,435030,30087359,Posted: 21 February,all,Millesabords,"You know what ? I was looking for Mahjong, and here I found something to make me glu at the screen even longer. It's Mahjong, but with a story. Lances, caves, boars and mighty elven town guards, with sexy armored bikini. Well, don't get too cocky, here you're doing slooooooow pace story, looooong lasting quests. But remember : it's a Mahjong game, where no frantic nords are running half-naked in snowy mountains and slashing dragons every now and then, hum ? Mahjong. With a story. That's enough for sparing a lot of coffee cups."

The game has very high production qualities and is very fun to play, even if you never sink any money into it."

76561198062257976,Recommended,435030,29473654,Posted: 24 January,all,PhoenixSkye,"I've always loved Mahjong and play every Mahjong game I can find.  I've had this for a while but never played it.  Recently started playing while taking a break from another game.  I'm hooked.  Finally, a game on Steam that I can play and do well at!  after being on Steam for a long long time it's nice to FINALLY see the Achievements.  YAY me!!!!  I Freely admit I'm not much of a gamer even though I love RPG.  I just don't have time to play enough to get really good.  But I've been playing Mahjong since long before the advent of Video Games.  This particular game is engaging and challenging but still playable.  Absolutely love it!"
