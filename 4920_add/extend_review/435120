,Recommended,435120,22826992,"Posted: 6 May, 2016",all,Faudraline,"Past is never dead. It is not even past.Rusty Lake Hotelis the 7th game inCube Escapeseries, a series of mostly freeware room escape games with elegant yet disturbing undertone. All games in the series can be either reached via Kongregate, or can be purchased as a freeware for iOS or Android. I've played the first of these games,Cube Escape: The Lakein Kongregate some years ago, and found out that the developers continued to make new games in the series, revealing new clues to the spiritual, surreal yet eerie world of the Rusty Lake, connecting pieces of a morbid story with each new game. If you are curious and would like to appreciate the world of Rusty Lake appropriately, I strongly suggest you to play other games with the intended timeline to fully enjoy the experience that is Rusty Lake. Most of these games present you 15-20 minutes of gameplay with more anecdotes to speculate about the nature of the given world and its setting.In this short yet morbid puzzle game, we take the role of a butler that serves in the Rusty Lake Hotel, a mysterious establishment settled upon a small island in the middle of the infamous Rusty Lake. The world of Rusty Lake is inhabited by odd andromorphic animals, including our hotel staff: all knowing and charismatic hotel manager Mr. Owl, silent attendant and receptionist Mr. Crow, bell boy Mr. Bat and chef extraordinaire Mr. Toad. In a fateful evening, our guests arrive: Mr. Deer, Mr. Boar, Miss Pheasant, Mr. Rabbit and Mrs. Pigeon. They will be staying with us for a short while, and it is our duty to attend their needs and arrange an excellent dinner party for our guests each night. Sounds simple enough, yet with each passing night our encounters grow a bit more disturbing, ending with a peculiar story revelation somewhat meaningful only if you've played previous games.Here comes mild or speculative spoilers, so feel free to skip this paragraph if need be. As a personal interpretation, the Cube Escape series, aside from highly disturbing point and click adventures, serve as symbolic happenstances concerning memory, deed and afterlife. Various figures with their own vices - like vanity, gluttony, greed etc. are presented as andromorphic animals in this surreal habitat where they'll be lured with their own vices as bait and used to satisfy a supernatural demand by gruesome means. The hotel and its environment serves as a Limbo-like setting for their memories to be extracted and collected. It was mentioned in previous games that the lake feeds on memories and whence memories are extracted from guests, what is left would be unsettling creatures of nightmares - or rather our antagonists for the following games. Yet again, this is just a personal interpretation, so I highly suggest for you to try other games to present your own. It all is quiteTwin Peaks-ish with a touch of John Keddie.The game mostly consists of a basic point & click adventure, with some neatly arranged puzzles and a room escape concept for each night. If you manage to complete the game, you will be given a code to use in following Cube Escape games, revealing more information about the nature of this symbolic setting. This is a gruesome and short experience for your own contemplation considering all events and figures presented are highly symbolic and more so supernatural. It's more like surrealist art; completely open to interpretation and even to introspection.

76561198140299850,Recommended,435120,20862085,"Posted: 30 January, 2016",all,foofaraw,"Rarely have I been so sure of the power and quality of a small indie game as quickly as I have with “Rusty Lake Hotel”. I’ve played less than an hour and a half so far, so there will likely be more to be said, and this may be uncommonly brief.The premise of “Rusty Lake Hotel” is you are Mr. Owl, and you have invited 5 creature friends to your hotel for a visit, including a special meal each day. Not to give too much away, but each day there is one less guest to entertain. This is a humorous game, but which also contains some pretty graphic cartoony violence and gore.During the day you explore the hotel, talk to the guests and employees, and look for objects needed later. This phase is generally quite brief, as it’s basically just a preamble to the nighttime puzzle work. Only at night are you able to visit the guests in their rooms, and that’s where the fun begins. Each guest’s room has a theme. Mr. Rabbit is a magician, and his room, and the puzzles to be solved, involve magic. Mr. Deer involves finding the ingredients to fix a drink, including puzzles involving volume (as well as others, all closely inter-related.) Ms. Pidgeon, who has asked you to run her bath, has puzzles involving electricity and math. Most of the puzzles are simple, and provide some small item to lead to a quite possibly bigger puzzle to be solved. But (so far at least), each room’s puzzles must be completely solved, and the meat needed for the next day’s “special meal” must be found, before each room can be exited. Some items for the meal are optional, but the more you find, the more stars you receive for the quality of the meal when served. Presumably, the number of stars unlocks some feature(s) later on.And that’s something new, in my humble experience. Rarely have I encountered a puzzle game where each area MUST be solved completely for game continuation. As such, it will most likely need to be restarted FROM THE BEGINNING, including all the dialog involved, repeatedly. The good news is that once each room is solved, repeating is simple, if you’ve kept your notes and have a decent memory. (Yes, you will need to solve some puzzles with the help of paper and pencil.)But more good news: the game includes some form of Walkthrough, yet to be investigated.Each day, having solved to puzzles in one room, you will take the ingredients you have found to prepare a meal….for one less guest. Presumably a larger puzzle opens as more guests are………served.I don’t doubt the repetition in “Rusty Lake Hotel” will prove a bit tedious, but quite likely there’s a good reason, yet to be determined. For full price, non-discounted, of $1.99US, I would give this game my NEXT TO HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION – 4/5."

If you haven't played any of the Rusty Lake games, I recommend that you look them up. This is the only game that I've seen them charge money for. I personally liked the weirdness of the game, but if you are on the fence about buying this game, go look at the other games online, play those, then make your decision. Anyways, here are my pros and cons:Pros:- Game is different, it isn't like other games.- Doesn't rely on jumpscares for a spooky atmosphere.- Puzzles are tricky, but not impossible.- Also, puzzles don't depend on luck, but actually require thought.- Game keeps you on your toes.- The artwork looks good.- Music is fitting and sounds good.- Each level can recieve 1-3 stars, so you can play the game a few times to get 3 stars everytime.- Game makes you think, and does require interpretation for a full mind-blowing effect.Cons:- Without playing the other games beforehand, this game seems really weird and the ending won't make sense. (Even after playing the other games the ending is a bit confusing.)- To get 3 stars everytime, you may need to look at a walkthrough. I personally couldn't figure it out on my own.- To get 3 stars everytime, sometimes you need to find certain items within a certain time frame (so you may need to find item A before you use item B otherwise you cannot find item A at all).- If you aren't okay with games having an ending that doesn't give answers, you aren't going to like this.TLDR: Game is interesting, but you should look up the other Rusty Lake games to make sure you like this type of game."

It could likely be a free flash game and I wouldn't know the difference. There is nothing horribly wrong with it, other than it is short and fairly one-dimensional as far as depth and complexity goes. It all feels very 'mobile' with the constant spam clicking.So what do you need to know?The puzzle solutions don't always make sense, this is usually a deal-breaker for point-and-click games with me, but here it is ok enough. For each room, you need to at least find the main 'ingrediant' (which is killing the room renter). For bragging rights you can find two other bonus items to really see everything. None of it is really all that difficult. This isn'tMyst. While there is little voice acting, what is present is actually really good. The story is something akin to what we could expect from a Wes Anderson and Tim Burton collaboration.Pros:+Cheap game that will entertain you for a day+Quirky and dark little story that is interesting enough+Artwork is nice, and fitting+Some of the scenes are pretty cool (I liked when the boar was smoking opium)Cons:-It all feels very mobile-The on-screen arrows (left, right, back) should actually be 'buttons' proper so I know the boundaries of where I can click-The puzzle solutions are not always logical, which is stupidI think it is worth two bucks, but barely.Will I keep playing the series? Yeah probably, since it is fun to sit around with a friend and work through it."

,Recommended,435120,20887549,"Posted: 31 January, 2016",all,"Communist ""Joseph Ballin"" Layton","Rusty Lake Hotel probably won't last you more than two hours unless you make a mistake or two in the process of getting full completion, but it's also priced to reflect that. The game is essentially a series of 5 puzzle rooms similar to Escape the Room-type flash games (which is what this developer is mostly known for), and while it isn't amazingly complex it's still relatively fun, and the interesting concept of the game helps keep it going. The only problem I have with it is that the story just leads up to a To Be Continued message, making this the sort of game that I wouldn't recommend unless you're more interested in the puzzle solving than the story. It's hard to deny the fact that this is a game that probably would've been free on a flash site a few years ago, but at least it has the courtesy to only charge $2, unlike plenty of other indie games of the same length."

,Not Recommended,435120,31276383,Posted: 21 April,all,Armesis,"Its a nice idea and the rendering is cute, but the puzzles make no logical sense whatsoever. Spoiler alert - In one scene in a guest room i have to click on a deer trophy and then click again on its horn. This will make its horn grow. Click it again 12 times and the other horn will grow,  with a piece or rosemary spice attached to it. Voila, you have achieved a mission goal and obtained rosemary. How would any sane person firgure out that you had to goto the deer trophy somewhere in the room to grow its horns to get rosemary??? This game, like some others is a case of ""This is how my unique imagination works, so you must think exactly like me to solve my puzzles.""Im sorry, but clicking on a trophy deer's head to get rosemary does not make sense at all. In another dimension perhaps, it does. If you want to keep your sanity, stay clear of this game."
,Recommended,435120,21043703,"Posted: 7 February, 2016",all,WidescreenRules,"This is a delightfully macabre point-and-click that should be a good way to kill a few hours. You can tell right from the introduction what you're going to be getting yourself into, but it's still rather delicious fun and a recipe for some brain teasing. The vast majority of the puzzles are self-contained in their own areas, so you don't have to worry about getting part A from room B after unlocking the door for room C with the key that you found in room D.If I have any complaint it's that you essentially need a walkthrough to get everything because some of the requirements for 100% completion and even a few of the required solutions are bizarre and by no means obvious.Still, it's worth a few hours of your time for some wonderfully dark humor and simple yet charming art direction."
,Recommended,435120,27881905,"Posted: 27 November, 2016",all,Tibbsy,"Overall a pretty standard ""escape room"" kind of flash game. I've played similar ones in terms of length and difficulty for free online. It tends to be a bit tedious as there is no save option and if you miss something but want to get total completion in the game, the only option is to reset and start all over. I have a hard time recommending it for anyone other than total fans of point and click escape room puzzlers because there are free flash games exactly like this online. It's a pretty fun little adventure, though, so what the heck. For 2 bucks, go for it"
,Recommended,435120,35420442,Posted: 2 October,all,Audish,"The macabre has ironically been beaten to death in the gaming world, what with blood and viscera having become a more common room decor than wallpaper. That makes it all the more refreshing when a game takes a more cerebral approach to murder, such as with a sophisticated murder mystery. If you’ve come to Rusty Lake Hotel looking for that, however, you’re not going to get much more than the appearance of sophistication. There are hints of something special here, but it’s obfuscated by a thin plot, awkward puzzles, and literal boar♥♥♥♥♥♥You are introduced to the proprietor of the Rusty Lake Hotel, one Mr. Owl, as he guides a raft of five guests across the quiet waters to their lodgings. Each of the animal-faced visitors has their own reason for attending Mr. Owl’s gathering, and it’s your job to attend to their needs during their stay. Every evening the guests will set down to dinner, and then afterwards you will follow one of them to their room to assist them in some way. There is an ulterior motive to your service, of course, and it will see more and more vacancies open at the hotel as you progress.Spoiler alert for the main plot which you will learn about maybe five minutes into the game: The hotel has no main dishes to serve the guests, and said guests happen to be comprised of delicious meats. Whatever you may have been imagining about mysteries and intrigue, you can dump it because what you are actually doing here is murdering guests to feed to other guests. Most of the game takes place in the five rooms of the visitors, where a complex series of puzzles and brain-teasers will allow you to engineer a fatal encounter with the occupant and harvest their flesh. The next day you serve it to whoever remains, and then roll on to the next unlucky critter.That makes the meat (heh) of the game the puzzles, and this is where most people are going to stumble. Each room is four walls covered with shelves, portraits, tables, and other decor that will be clicked upon and used to eventually kill someone. Expect plenty of locked cabinets with hidden keys, letter and number substitution puzzles, classics like unlabeled weights and measuring water out, and using strange items on other items. About half the puzzles are pretty logical and easy to spot but the other half is the killer, requiring you to click on sprouts until they randomly blossom into keys, or click on toy monkeys in a specific order, or look out a window at the right time, or feed a boar♥♥♥♥♥♥sandwich to the boar who♥♥♥♥♥♥it out. And let me assure you, I do not possess the capacity to make that last one up.Mr. Boar’s room was where I almost gave up on the game, between the fecal snack and the bleeding toilet and the insipid, confusing puzzle-locked cabinets. I stuck with it to see where the game went and I’m happy to report that the ending is interesting, even if the means of getting there were not. Rusty Lake Hotel feels like an excerpt or aside from a much longer tale, one that needs context that isn’t given anywhere. Things happens because they HAVE to happen to advance the plot, not because they make sense. There’s a dark aura to the proceedings but the ridiculous elements like animal heads and poop take the Lynchian edge off and make it all feel awkward and arbitrary.This one rides the line between yea and nay moreso than any other game I’ve reviewed thus far. It’s mechanically thin, the puzzles are poorly designed, and what little story there is is tainted by absurdity. But once you understand what it expects of you and what it offers it becomes a much smoother ride, and honestly the ending was a very bright point of darkness that helped color the game in retrospect. It’s hard to recommend but I don’t regret playing it in the end, and I must admit I’m interested in seeing what the rest of the series can offer.Did you enjoy this review? I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope you'll check out more of them athttps://goldplatedgames.com/or on mycuration page!"

Had similar hopes for Rusty Lakes Hotel but was to be sadly disappointed.It has the same quirky artwork and surreal (macarbre) settings which is fine but the game suffers from a HUGE problemThat is, you can not SAVE the game and it's own AUTOSAVE funstion is totally f***ed up.To explain . . .Your task is to collect the cooking ingredients for a variety of meals (3 ingredients each)There are essentially 2 location areas.  There's the downstairs lobby and the upstairs rooms.For some of the menus, the ingredients you need are both in the lobby and in the bedrooms.The way the game works is that once you enter a bedroom, it locks the door and YOU CAN NOT LEAVE THE ROOM until you have collected the ""meat"" element of the recipe for that room.  This is an immediate problem.  If you didn't realise that one of the ingredients was downstairs and you've entered the bedroom there is no NO WAY to complete the full recipe (for which you gain 3 stars).   It's insane.  You even get to go back downstairs after you leave the bedroom but the item you wanted can not then be acquired.There's a similar problem with the order in which things MUST be done if you want to achieve the full list of 3 ingredients for each recipe.   For example in one room, you get a knife and you use it help you get into a box.  However it is also used to rip open a picture on the wall.  Guess what, if you open the box first then the knife stays there and can't be picked up again.  Result you can't complete the recipe.  WTF?!   There is literally no clue about this unspoken order that is required, you thus are forced to keep redoing the ""level"" (bedroom) until you get it right.  There is however a HUGE BUT . . . .When you go to reload from the autosave it puts you back into the bedroom before you touched anything which seems great until you realise that your inventory is MISSING THE INGREDIENT  that you previously first picked up in the lobby !!!   So once again you now can not complete the full recipe to gain your 3 stars.   At this point you are totally stuffed.  Your only choice now is to restart the entire ****ing game !Sorry but this is simply ridiculous.Any player is going to want to at least be able to complete the game and do it properly to earn all the stars.   However it simply isn't possible due to that broken autosave problem.After 3 bedrooms I had to abandon this.   I could put up with reloading specific bedrooms, if that actually worked, but having to restart the entire bloody game over and over to get a perfect score is just ludicrous.A shame as Roots was a lovely game.  This is unplayable imo."

And I fell in love with this amazingly twisted, dark, puzzle-filled world. Everything in the game is beautifully constructed from the art to the puzzles (although that one water jug puzzle in the first room is so frustrating!) and while there were no notable jumpscares (as far as I noticed), the mood was constantly rather tense. Rusty Lake Hotel is a nice little point-and-click puzzle game that doesn't promise you miracles but delivers what itdoespromise really nicely.

Otherwise, ultimately, I can't recommend it with a clear conscience, because the developer's made the error of selling a game with the same quality as the games they gave away.1) The rendering engine: If you full-screen the game, it looks pretty awful.  Textures are blurry, lines aren't sharp, etc.2) Progress: There are no checkpoints, and there is no way to reset to the start of a day in case you screw up.3) Replay value: There is no accumulation of already-gathered optional ingredients from a previous playthrough - so, for every day you want to go back and ""fix"", you have to play it VERY carefully (unless you want to play the whole game over again because you got the one you missed, but missed the other one).These are all forgiveable for free games, but the moment I've paid even a couple dollars for it - these are essential."

For under 5 NZ dollars you can pick up this game and the sequel, both of which fit into the larger narrative that started in the aforementioned flash games. Score, Visuals and Puzzles mesh to make something truly special.REVIEWStory:I've seldom seen storytelling done like this. Characters speak directly very infrequently and intuitive pictoral hints tell you a ton about the characters you meet. The story seems minimal, but everything that happens means something, even if you can't tell what it is. This game is ideal if you want to sit back and revel in the weirdness of some incredibly creative indie devs. Deeper story elements are shown, but they are murky and obscured, masterfully working with the continued theme of the lake. Dark gods, esoteric spirits and twisted motives lurk below the seemingly innocuous children's book style and mundane puzzle tasks. The story is a delight to unveil, so I will tell you no more. 8.5/10Graphics:The art style is... Unique. Imagine a blend between 'American Gothic', 'Over the Garden Wall', old silent cartoons and creepy taxidermies, and you begin to get an idea of the excellent visuals presented in this game. Click through the screenshots if you can't be bothered googling those things. Everything is unsettling and surreal, but subtly. It feels like a dusty piece of American folk art, which really clicks with my particular sensibilities. With that said, I can see how the limited animation and somewhat simple graphics could be a putoff. For me, it's a real hit. 9/10Gameplay:Aside from a few irritating or samey puzzles, Rusty Lake Hotel is a sterling example of puzzle gaming. The game sets seemingly mundane tasks with esoteric twists and disturbing results. I won't discuss the intent of the puzzles, but they follow a shared, sinister theme. While the weakest element of the game, the puzzles are still excellent. 7/10Overall:I opened my steam wallet and found it was bare,I thought to myself that there was something thereJust a moment before, but I remembered with shame,That it a fever I had spent it on games.I looked through my library for something new,Found Jotun, The Deed and Surgeon Sim tooBut there were two more that caught my attentionTo find out was it was about my intentionI booted it up and soon saw my mistakeWhen I thought the worst of the game Rusty Lake.The visuals, the music, the tension thick as tar,The mystery, the ambience, the puzzles bizarreI soon bought the sequel, my thirst not yet slaked,I'd become an addict of the studio Rusty Lake.In short, RL:H is a game that I am proud to have in my Steam Library.

It made for fresh experience for a puzzle game.On the downside though, some of the puzzles seemed just a littleoddmaybe?  Most puzzles I think made sense, but some puzzles were difficult to know what you were even supposed to do, which led me to wandering around and just clicking on everything and then seeing something happen which was also sometimes equally inexplicable to me.  While I did resort to a walkthru for one puzzle, the puzzle itself made sense -- I just couldn't figure that one out.  That's on me. :-P   But what I did find kind of telling is that the game's own menu system has links to walkthroughs for each of the rooms.  I'm not sure if I should see this as a convenience for the player, or an admittance that even the devs think some of the puzzles just don't make sense?Overall:  I enjoyed my time in the game and I want to like it more than I ultimately did, and also considering that the game is quite short (it still only took me 2.5hrs but I'm sure that's longer than avg), I'd rate this ~ a 6.5 out of 10."

Ridiculous, irrational things will happen. There’s not much of a story, nor is there engaging dialogue. If you’re willing to accept these facts, and ditch the sacrosanct rules of traditional point and click adventures, I think the game will be a delight for you.I wouldn’t call Rusty Lake Hotel violent or anything, but some events do occur that are macabre and unsettling. It’s not a game for young children, but for any other gamer who wants to experience a mind-f*ck, surreal casual adventure, I would strongly recommend this game.

There were a few exceptions and some of the puzzles were quite fun, but it's not fun to just click all over every screen and hope you find the ""optional"" items before you solve the main puzzle, because you never know which step will be the last and once you finish it you're kicked out of the room. If you didn't get one of the optional items, too bad because you can't go back.Do I recommend this? Hard to say.

Some scares too but there is no need to hurry.Each day takes you to a different room.  It is up to you to decide where to go.  Once there, you look around the room and puzzle out how to give the guest what they asked for.  Some things are not as straight-forward as you would hope but there is a logic to everything.  It can be cruel at times but no worse than in the past and certainly not in the future.Things here will make more sense if you have played Cube Escape.  There is even a little surprise for you in Birthday if you reach perfection here.  But as it stands it is both longer and shorter than many Cube Escape.  I am aware that some may be a bit disappointed by the brevity but there are presently nine other titles free of charge and Roots is considerably longer.

,Recommended,435120,26096518,"Posted: 17 October, 2016",all,RipWitch,"""Rusty Lake Hotel"" is a point and click puzzle game that has a disturbing underlining plot laced into it. Join for 5 nights to solve puzzles in your guests' rooms and to cook them a dish each night that they will die for.Each room is a whole puzzle to get what you ultamately came for(their meat), and to ensure the player to complete, it halts you from leaving the room. This can be appealing, as you know the solution is somewhere in the room, not having to run between rooms to get clues or objects. With each puzzle, it gives you enough clues for you to figure it out, but not too much to make it too easy. Each room has its own theme with the puzzles designed to correspond with the theme and the music different with each room. Depending on your puzzle solving skills, each room varies between completion times.Not only does every room act as a whole puzzle, there are two puzzles that are active throughout the whole game, making the meals and a key puzzle. While making the meals perfectly can be difficult, the game does help with guiding you through the most effective way to get the ingredients, some requiring you to look closely and some requiring you to remember if the guest was drinking something.The negatives with Rusty Lake Hotel is the ending, especially to those not familiar with Rusty Lake's other works like I am. Another can be the length, but this game is very puzzle driven to progress, so the length may vary between person to person.Overall, Rusty Lake Hotel is a charming and surreal puzzle game that makes the most out of the time it has."

And while I could say a whole lot, I'll try and keep it brief.Firstly, this is perhaps my favorite game from the Cube Escape series. It's hard to make that judgment considering how much I love every game in this series (as you might have noticed, my avatar is a screenshot from the recently-released Cube Escape: Birthday). But Rusty Lake Hotel does something special by bringing together elements - and characters, as you'll realize if you played the previous installments - from the games before it, and makes for a very intriguing, very eye-opening, very unnerving and unnatural experience.What do I mean by that last part? Simply put (and without spoiling anything), things get weird, and some would say gut-wrenching. The gameplay is similar to all of the games before it, as it should be, with the goal being trying to find particular items to accomplish the main objective. In this game's case, the objective is to find ingredients each night which will allow you to cook a savory dish for your guests the next day. A new element not previous in past games is the ability to find bonus items, which will allow you to get higher scores each day and eventually unlock something special in the end. The gameplay is, as always, thought-provoking and unnerving; mildly puzzling in some cases, moderately challenging in others. I guarantee you moments where you'll be grinning, gasping, and subsequently staring in disbelief at your screen in the span of minutes. It's the kind of game that makes you want to know more with each passing moment, and it fully delivers in the uncanny department. There were also parts where I was simply hesitant to act, knowing what would come; other times I was laughing at the ridiculousness of the circumstances, particularly the happenings in the room of Mr. Rabbit (Rest In Peace, valiant hare). All around, it's a game both chilling and absurd, enjoyable and brain-racking. All around, it's a great experience. I could complain about the problems I had with some puzzles, and my inability to collect all of the bonus ingredients, but I'd really only be expressing personal issues at that point - I'm admittedly dense at times in games like these, and so there's really nothing wrong here but my own lack of sight (or so I'd think). That being said, beware the water jugs.To summarize, Rusty Lake Hotel delivers excellently for the first premiere game from the series. It keeps in line with the previous (extremely bizarre and difficult to understand) storyline and general style, while also introducing more through some new elements and abilities. It's plot is strange to say the least, but makes you want more - much more, in my case. The game gave me a couple hours of fun and frustration, and in the end left me jaw open and wanting a sequel immediately. If you're a fan of the Cube Escape series, point-and-click games, and dark, eerie, and morbid storytelling, then this is the game for you. And if you're not a fan of any of these, buy the game anyway; Rusty Lake Hotel will make you a fan.I wholeheartedly recommend this game, and it's fully worth the price."

I love clever clues and connecting obscure bits of information to solve problems. While the premise (and trailer) set up what seems to be an intriguing plot and potentially interesting characters, don't expect any type of story or mystery here. You're the bad guy. You kill each person off and don't get a choice as to the order in which you do things, nor any freedom in HOW you remove each guest from the list. There is also no explanation for WHY these guests need to die, and when you are successful, it is uninteresting and ultimately unsatisfying.. Worst of all, you can only progress by clicking everything randomly and hoping something will happen, so there is no real reward for solving the ""puzzles"".No atmosphere, no interaction with guests (they all stand around silently...), no heart, no charm.

With that said, I still wish I hadn't bought the bundle this game came with. The story is minimal, but still interesting. Although, it's also never actually explained. Some will say ""but you'll understand if you play the Cube Escape games!"" but I say ""Then it should be bundled with those game"". Even then, any kind of side-game should still be even somewhat entertaining and understandable to some degree on its own. This game, isn't.The puzzles range from actual brain-teasing to 100% random, to click-everywhere-until-something-happens-maybe. I enjoyed the puzzles that used legitimate logic, but some were either random and you had to find by accident, or completely betrayed the game's earlier use of logic. I won't spoil any of them, but by the time the end of the game came, the lack of closure or an actual story at all had me extra frustrated with the poor excuses for ""puzzles"" near the end of the game.It's definitely easier, shorter, and more lacking in story than the other game in the bundle, Rusty Lake: Roots.

I am not a puzzle master by any means, and I was still able to complete the game without using a walkthrough.- Walkthrough provided; even though I didn't need it, there may be others who need help. The developers have provided a link in the settings window that takes you directly to a quick walkthrough provided by them.- Unique setting: I don't want to spoil it(although it's pretty clear early on), but the setting is a unique twist on the classic ""strangers invited to an island in the middle of nowhere"" premise. I really enjoyed it.- Atmosphere: The game executes atmosphere perfectly, balancing creepiness with quirkiness.Neutral:- Ending: The ending is not what I expected. After looking into it I realized that Rusty Lake Hotel is part of a series of games made by the developers, and the ending connects to elements seen in these other games.Luckily,all of these games are free, both on the iOS appstore and on their website. There are 7 total, and so far I've completed 4 of them. If you enjoy Rusty Lake Hotel then I really encourage you to play these as well. They expand on the game's lore and really bring the creepiness factor up a notch. ICons:- Built in flash; Not a huge con, but being built in Flash means right-clicking will bring up a menus.

The latest in the Cube Escape Series, this little gem has you playing hitman for Mr. Owl, the Hotel's ""owner"" and curator.For the first time in the series, we are happily murdering the other characters. Are these actions our own? Perhaps. In the beginning, this seems like a harmless and pleasant visit to the Rusty Lake Hotel. Once the shrimp cocktails are dispensed, however, you get your first task. You must kill one guest each night until all of them are dead.You are given no further information as to why these guests deserve to die other than they have ""their own reasons for being here."" Why do we trust Mr. Owl? Do we fear him? Does he compel us? There are no answers to these questions.If there were a way to make hotel murder fun, consider this the game the one that makes the mold. The puzzles are challenging but fun. Walkthroughs are provided by the creators just in case you get stuck. More than once, I found myself laughing maniacally while carrying out my morbid tasks. There's a clever mixture of whimsy, humour, and horror in these games.Each room and character is unique. Each room has its own atmospheric soundtrack. The characters Mr. Owl and Mr, Crow are returning and familiar friends from the other Rusty Lake Games. Lastly, the games themselves seem influenced by Twin Peaks. For anyone who is a fan of the show, or the genre, this game is a must for the ""owls are not what they seem.""I hope you enjoyed my review and find this game as entertaining as I did.

I liked the graphics and the overall aesthetic of the game.

I'm not that squeamish (nor am I a vegan/vegetarian), and I usually like things that are considered ""macabre,"" but I just didn't like it. And I couldn't get past it. I was squicked out.

The answer is always no, but we're pretending. you're looking for engaging puzzles, yes? Well, the monkey is still working on that so come back never. I finished the deer room. The deer's room contains about a dozen different things to work though, and only two were puzzles. I need this deer's blood huh? So he wants a drink. First puzzle with weights and a scale gets me into the safe which contains a knife. So I stab the deer for- nope. So I need to poison him first I guess. I have to open this window and trap this moth with this glass. Then clicking the moths in this specific order which is conveniently on this nice painting of moths of the deer's wall gives me a seed out of the moths. why is the seed in the moths and why did clicking them give me it? Monkeys. plant the seed. Grow the seed by clicking it, because monkeys. grind the plant to make poison. mix it with water by doing some water puzzle, which is a puzzle because I can't poor water properly. Mix it with the deer's own blood and Tabasco sauce from milking antlers on the wall; Which can only be solved by order of; I haven't clicked on this yet so click it all over till things happen. I did it. You like clicking games. That's why you're here. So, the nonsense of it means nothing to you right? You like that stupid monkey garbage, don't you? Checkmate. Google clicking puzzle games, and play an infinite pool of copy paste uninspired garbage that won't hold your mouse hostage in it's poorly made app window. Oh sorry. What was I thinking.

This, I thought would all lead to a climactic ending where all the mysteries the story gave you were solved. But boy was I wrong, it just ends on a ""To be continued"" screen. This lazy finish and ridiculous puzzles amount to a tedious game that has little going for it but atmosphere."

I wish there was a button to skip cutscenes, and preferably a way to go back when I misclick (and say enter the wrong room or get certain items that are points-of-no-return before I intend to).Edit: I take it back. I loved this game, but then I spent about an hour over several days trying to find the blackberries. I've clicked on every square inch of that room with the naked mouse, and every noticeable feature with every item you can pick up in that room.

However, the superficial elements of the story were predictable, and the non-superficial elements, if they existed, were obfuscated to the point where you didn't really engage with or care about them. Also, the game's buggy. It's easily possible to put it in an unwinnable state by doing things in an order other than what the developers expected. Did I earn all the stars? Also no, but I in no way felt compelled to go back and try. Some cheap scatological humour put me off a bit as well.This wasn't a terrible game, and it was certainly odd, plus it's very inexpensive.

The ending is super wierd and has me guessing at its meaning right now just after beating it.The only complaints I can think of right now are that in most cases you can't turn back, once you enter a guests room unless you want to restart the game you can't turn back, once you complete the main objective you can't spend anymore time trying to get the optional objective but this isn't too big a deal because the game is quite short and there's no reason you can't just use the walkthroughs for levels you've already done so this one is annoying at worst, second and last one I can think of right now is sometimes when your looking at an entire room you can't see things which are out of place in the room such as small things over character's shoulders and poking out from behind objects. I would say that this game is worth the 1.99 I spent on it and for some it may be worth replaying once or twice to get all three stars on every level.

I knew instantly that it was going to be a game that appeased my curious appetite. Food and Murder, I'm absolutely in! It was a jump into my recently found love of Point&Clicks. Unfortunately, this quick ordering left me a little hungry since it only feels like an appetizer. All the same...It was delicious.Pros:- The character designs are what made me buy the game so quickly. They're seemingly basedon Victorian/Edwardian taxidermy and photography. They are delightfully creepy and appealing to the eye. They fit into the atmosphere around them, and for me they help make the game feel like a dark picture book.-Music wise the Rusty Lake Hotel is haunting. Each room has sounds unique to it, and they do distract from the puzzle solving process. Each piece sets the mood for each room, and it really adds to the game without being annoying.-The Puzzles for this point and click adventure are interesting and properly themed to each Dinner Guest. Often they are macbre, fun, and not too frustrating. There are exceptions to this,however.-Each room tells interesting hints about their occupants. They are all unique to their guests personalities/lives outside of The Rusty Lake Hotel.Cons:-Honestly, this game is incredibly short. You can work your way through the meal fairly quickly. In my excitement to order I didn't completely read up on the game. For the price, however, I likely should have known. Still...It really left me wanting more despite my enjoyment of the puzzles and death.-Some of the puzzles for extra ingredients could be incredible frustrating. Often, I was unable to find optional ingredients because I was too soft hearted or it just didn't seem like something one would naturually do.Overall, I really enjoyed Rusty Lake Hotel! I got more than enough entertainment out of it for what I paid...even if I'm not quite full yet. The good news is the next game Rusty Lake:Roots has been announced! So, it seems that we may be getting a second helping yet. Bon Appetit, my friends."

It was a puzzle game what was totally possible and just the right amount of challenging. There were times I was stuck, but after taking a step back and observing everything, it was do-able. The thing that I love about it is that there's the main game (basic murder; no big deal!), PLUS optional items for you to find for every meal. I got through the game in about an hour but then spent a few more trying to get the perfect three stars for every meal. The only cons I would list are the dreary music (cool for atmosphere at first but if you were like me and played it enough to log more than 5 hours, it gets old and depressing), and the fact that if you messed up ONE TINY PART in your quest for a perfect score, you had to start over (every meal had an ingredient that was incredibly specific to find and only on certain night or certain ways). The good thing about this though like I said, was the fact that they're optional ingredients for a reason: you can still really enjoy the game without going the extra 5 miles."

You find yourself at hotel where all of the other guests are various animals. Your goal: murder each guest and serve them for that night's dinner. Crazy and weird theme, but interesting nonetheless. The game is simply a series of room puzzles, where you click around to find items, combine these items or use them in the environment, and solve occasional puzzles that eventually lead to the death of your chosen guest. These types of games often suffer from ""moon logic"", where players can get stuck due to illogical item combinations, but fortunately Rusty Lake Hotel is pretty straight forward.You ShouldBuyThis Game If:You like ""escape room"" (point-and-click) style gamesYou're looking for a quick gameplay experience (~1-2 hours)You want a laid back gameplay experienceYou like games that are weird and mildly disturbing (in a good way)You ShouldSkipThis Game If:You are looking for action or fast-paced gameplayYou want a long experienceYou want a game with difficult puzzles (the ones here shouldn't be much of a challenge)My Personal Opinion (Recommendation Reflects This)I personally really enjoyed Rusty Lake Hotel.

,Not Recommended,435120,34298893,Posted: 16 August,all,Greydawn,"It's a neat horror-ish point and click adventure game. It all amounts to nothing though for it's stinger ending, at least I assume, if you don't pefect each dish and do the thing in the lobby. Again, it's neat, but I wouldn't buy it as there's not enough here to be more than a free flash game on Newgrounds or somewhere like it, and even some of those have more than this one, in my opinion."

Unfortately, like most games in this genre is has a few stock puzzles, namely the rotating thing in Mr. Boar's room."
