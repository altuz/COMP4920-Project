,Recommended,435360,22276079,"Posted: 6 April, 2016",all,EmergencyBattle,"At the time of writing I have completed one playthrough of the game. In one go. TL;DR: it's an enjoyable game with a good story and nice and glossy art.It has a few parts that are a bit wonky. I can't speak for the Japanese version, but in the English version there are some bugs occasionally, but I encountered nothing game breaking. Just a couple of instances where character names were displayed without text underneath, but I don't think any of the actual story or dialogue was missing, because I didn't feel like there were any obvious gaps. Most likely it's just a residue of the lengths of the text in the text boxes not matching up in the Japanese and English versions.As for the translation itself, it felt pretty solid. I encountered a few spelling and grammatical mistakes, but nothing that made it unreadable or hard to understand. There was also one instance where I felt like something was probably a plot hole, but if it was it wasn't something that undermined anything truly vital to the plot. (Though again, to be clear, this is just speaking from one playthrough of one of the possible routes.) The story was engaging and the ending of the route I picked left me with a lot of interesting things that I can't wait to discover as I unlock more!The female characters were more well-rounded than I expected as I started, and I was pleasantly surprised that althoughthey (of COURSE) all end up falling in love with the protagonist, they are still more educated, and written in a way that actually shows it, and more multi-faceted than female characters usually are. Which isn't to say that everything was entirely perfect, some parts of the writing still made me cringe, but A LOT less than usual.The art style - especially the more quirky expressions - is really delightful. It kind of looks a bit like Kaen has stuffed a pillow over her bust, and I question Fuma's fashion sense with nothing underneath the vest immensely, but hey. I bet we've all seen worse.And finally - though I doubt that there will be too many who cares about this: A DIABETES MENTION THAT ISN'T NEGATIVE AND/OR DIRECTLY MISINFORMED AND STEREOTYPED!! HOLY CRAP!!!"

It was a pleasure to play and as far as I can see after the 1st time beating of the game I opened only like 60% of the story, which is nice.+All the girls are beautiful <3 And each has its very own character+Very nice music+The novel is very easy to read, you can catch yourself beating it in one sit :)+Plenty of the save slots, which is very useful because you have like 60 achievements to unlock and you face a LOT of decision-making situations+The story itself is very interesting to read+Steam cards, backs and smileys-Backgrounds looks okay but after all its just photoshopped photos :|-No ero ero .__   ."

,Recommended,435360,22651933,"Posted: 26 April, 2016",all,CheekyBlossom,"TL;DRwell researched, story driven Visual Novel with attention to details and at least 4 different endings. characters feel alive and choices do affect the game, cliffhangers will get you hooked and the music is tolerable (this coming from a metalhead!). Buy it for the story, a nice fresh wind for this genreLong reviewI recently started picking up Visual Novels again, and this is by far one of the best currently available on Steam, for thefollowing reasons:Art and musicThe art is certainly amazing; the characters don't appear too cute or overly sexualized (like some other games on Steam here ehem...); the art has obviously been influenced by Anime. Hence, if you don't like this, don't buy this game.In addition to that, the soundtrack is OK. It's not played in a loop and I actually enjoyed listening to the OST. Don't expect Hatsune Miku or JPop, the music is really fineReading the VNThe text aims to create the impression of an actual novel. There's not just one sentence per ""page"" displayed, the pages are filled with actual paragraphs, which is definitely a plus since the developers really put  their thoughts into their game. You may need to take breaks though since you may not be used to the font. I certainly needed to get used to reading that much on a screen again (old fashioned me, IKR)The contentThe story is very good for a VN, it will get you hooked with some nice cliffhangers here and there, and it is not too predictable which seems to be a common problem among some titles on Steam here. A lot of details have been added and every choice usually adds a different junk of dialogue. I was suprised since the developers really did their home work and researched historical facts and added ancient tales not related to Japan. The plot is somewhat serious, and this is certainly not a comic version. Expect daily lives of college students and Sci/Fi. It was definitely interesting to me.Also, the game has a very nice feature some other games seriously lack: choices. I'm mentioning this because a lot of games have been tagged with ""choices"", but the choices don't change the overall play style. In this game, you can get slightly different outcomes depending on your choices (dialogue) and these choices also influence what the characters say while the story itself is mostly linear. In addition, you can get different endings which heavily influence some of the content. You'll need to read carefully.But what's most important are the loveable characters who have been equipped with a lot of personal and emotional details. The characters appear real, very real, and depending on your choices, they can show surprising development. Don't just pick your favourite yet, they'll surprise you.Some minor negative remarks:The game does not offer voice acting, you need to actually read the lines, so if you are used to LISTENING, you may be disappointed. The FONT is tiny and may prove difficult to read, whereas some achievements are a bit too easy to guess in my opinion (if you're an achievement hunter that may annoy you)If you're looking for my Tl;dr, scroll up. Cheers!"

The story was very cerebrel so you really had to pay attention to the conversation since many little hints were sprinkled everywhere to help you solve the mystery. This one I played all the routes after finding a walkthrough just to see how the individual routes ended because I got the true ending my first time through. 'Tis the life of a harem master. ;-)"

I can say this visual novel was very enjoyable.Needless to say this novel really is quite a gem. There are many moments where the storyline will get you to think on a deeper end, and by that it may cause a headache in a sense. (Ever been in an existential crisis? Yea...)Despite such things. the VN really does have a lot of deep quotes that may take to your philosophical and/or psychological liking.For instance. (One of my favourites from this VN.)""A person dies twice. First, when their physical body dies. The second is when everyone in this world forgets they ever existed.""Each character has a very likeable uniqueness to them.I absolutely love the artwork and style, though I do feel there could've been more content.Music is great, however it feels limited.TL;DR: Great VN, can really get philosophical. 8/10Crude TL;DR: It's an absolute mind♥♥♥♥."

,Recommended,435360,24801663,"Posted: 9 August, 2016",all,ctswright,"Pretty good. Full of unique and likeable characters. Suffers from some jarring jumps in time that leave the player with gaps in information that occur far too often, and though I would have preferred more exposition or writing in the place of those jumps they can be ignored as they game will provide brief summaries of what the player wasn't able to see. If you read fast and/or skip through dialogue you've already read when trying for a new route, it's no a very long game and can be gotten through within a couple hours, but there's a surprisingly well written story full if equally well written characters within that package. Togi best girl."

Each choice didn't make dramatic changes to the story by itself.Depending on your tastes, the characters and their interactions can be really enjoyable. Also, depending on how much you emphasize on logical aspect of the game, you might get turned off by some ridiculous occurences or story backgrounds. If you're really flexible, like I am, you probably wouldn't mind them, as the explanations given don't sound too much like excuses.If you're looking for something not too complex and not too serious and would like to enjoy a good read and a simple mystery, this can be a good choice."

,Recommended,435360,24632663,"Posted: 31 July, 2016",all,Zurakci,"This visual novel isnt bad. However.. It suffers from what I would like to call ""I DONT REALLY CARE, MOVE ON TO THE IMPORTENT STUFF"" Syndrome. Its just the same as in Robot Alchemic Drive for the Playstation 2, its about fighting giant mechs with a mech: Pacific Rim Style, yet it keeps on dragging NONE NEEDED BITS IN IT!Concept of this game. Pretty nice. I like the concept of IMA, however, throughout the gameplaying I got from this (over 4 hours on first playthrough) I dont feel like I wanna continue and take a different path. Cause from what I got, the concept is there, but it is not the highlight.Art style is lovely. Its different from what I have seen used elsewhere. However, I wish there was more... There are not.I really wanted some of the characters to die. They were not needed (not gonna tell you whom, but you will see) and some are just... Characters that you see ONCE or TWICE! Wut iz diz???Overall. 4 hours on 3 times I have opened the game. So I will give it a 6/10Its not bad, it just lacks some stuff, like explanation(S!)."

,Recommended,435360,22289791,"Posted: 7 April, 2016",all,Yousagi,":: I haven't finished the game yet! This review is based on my first 4 hours with it. ::Campus Notes - forget me not is a Visual Novel that lacks in execution but fills in it's gaps with Charm, sometimes. It has a fever dream of a story, often times trying to jump above it's own heights with attempted profundity, and it lacks proper grounding and drama. All of the characters have character, but they're never really developed, at least up to the point I got.All in all, it's worth the admission price for visual novel fans, but that's in spite of it's content instead of because of it. I really hope that 4th Cluster continue to make games, since this game, it's characters and story, had a lot of potential than came to surface here."

Of course, the plot is also weird and random and autistic. I am not saying this to mock anyone, it's the fault of whoever wrote this game to have dumb and unconvincing characters - parodies of real people.But Campus Notes does have redeeming features, I did buy this game after all. The character art is amazing, in its quality and in all the variety of expressions. The backgrounds are good too. The cheesy carnival music can be muted. And you can save your game.
