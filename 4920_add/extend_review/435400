Beware that it's not exactly like Where's Wally, there are a handful of characters where you have to get an animation going before you can actually click to 'find' the person. This advice won't make sense, until it makes sense, y'know?"

We had some fun playing this on the TV while everyone pointed at cool things and passed the controller around. It is relaxing, pleasant, and sounds/looks great.

The sounds are funny, the animations are great, the fact that you need to dig/cut/shake/click on things make this hidden game really cool.It's a really nice casual game where you just kick back, have a cup of coffee and relax.A well deserved purchase !"
,Recommended,435400,30011189,Posted: 18 February,all,Ryan Dorkoski,"While not perfect,Hidden Folksbrings back fond memories ofWhere's Waldo?along with some cool bells-and-whistles that makes it more of a 'game'.This title gets an A+ for some really neat art and creative sounds. The ambience is very well done. Yeah, it becomes a bit of a click-fest after a while, and yeah, the animations become repetitive quicker than I'd like. That's why it's best played in short bursts.Well worth the few bucks to experience something unique for an afternoon.Essentially, this is a hidden-object-game styled after a classic childrens book series.There is a bar on the bottom of each screen that has characters or objects you must find. Hovering over said object gives a slight clue - which is supposed to be used (unlike 'help' in other hidden object games). The sounds are all acapella. You can invert the black and white screen if you are playing in the dark - the game has nice touches like that.Pros:+Fresh take on a classic childrens book series+The artwork and sounds are quite creative and work well together+There are a few 'mini-game' esque level variations that are neat+As of 2/17, they are apparently adding more content in the future+Good choice of quality-of-life game optionsCons:-Best in short bursts because there is limited animations and artwork; examples of this are things like - there are only a certain number of poses that quickly repeat, and other things like clickable holes in the ground or trees become redundantWhile I won't be logging dozens of hours here, it certainly makes me smile and give me fun coffee breaks:)"
,Recommended,435400,29940576,Posted: 15 February,all,brttd,"A delightful game.Clicking anywhere will give you a lovely sound effect, and finding new items with different sounds is quite fun.The actual objective of the game is to find special people/animals/objects hidden within the different levels, however there is a lot to see and interact with outside of the set objectives.The game is very enjoyable, both in trying to find the hidden folks, and in exploring the rest of the landscape."

When you don't have the energy to play something energetic, but you don't want to go to bed yet, this is the game to play. Maybe you find the hidden folks, maybe you don't, but it's entertaining to just watch and click things.If you get frustrated, then you need to go to bed little guy, because you're overtired.I am eagerly awaiting new areas in the future."
,Recommended,435400,30974320,Posted: 5 April,all,Informal Informant,"What the game isHidden Folkswas for me, a throwback to the good old days of looking through thoseWhere's Waldo(Where's Wally for those not in the States/Canada) books. It embodies the concept with a slight twist in the way that you can (somewhat) manipulate objects to help find the person. This feature helps give a bit more depth to the areas you explore, some of which are painstakingly large (Im looking at youThe Lab). Dispite these large spaces, the game still somehow finds a way to make it not the most difficult task to find someone on larger maps, although there are excetions.Pros+Good ArtHand-drawnesk art style complements game well+Lots of VariationSure, lots of people will be hidden behind or in something, but the mojority of the time the way to open/access said area is diffent+Detailed enviromentsThe places you look for these people are stuffed with detail that wouldnt even need to be there for this type of genre of game. All of the stuff in each level also seems realistic, and not just tons of people everwhere to hide other people.+DifficultyThis is one I could realy put in either the ""Pros"" or ""Cons"" of this review. Difficulty is a bit odd. Some people, and levels by extension, are really easy. Others are some of the most difficult ""find person"" levels I have ever done. Following these insainly difficult levels is often an easy one, then an average one, then another average, then a brutal level, with exceptions in worlds 1 and 4.Cons-Repetitive sound effectsThe sound effects, while absolutly hallarious and creative, are incredibly repetative after some time.-Map sizeMost maps were perfectly fine by this metric, but others not so much. One dry land level is so massive it takes ages to even find the area where the thing you are looking for is.Final OpinionHidden Folksis a hidden gem in a sea of games. I deeply enjoyed my hours spent, but I know not everyone will. For what it is, it is an amazing game that I can highly recomend, but only if you like or have liked  games or activities like the aformentionedWhere's Waldo. Although, I would not reccomend playing through the game in one sitting like I did."

76561197979487649,Recommended,435400,31259987,Posted: 20 April,all,Trashware,"This game is full of nostalgia and cuteness. As a kid I had a couple of these brilliantly drawn jigsaw puzzles filled to the brim with objects, animals and people all minding their own buisiness on a casual weekday. There was a seemingly endless amount of pieces (to the eyes of a child, at least) and it was a endless joy to figure out where to fit them and complete the set of thematically interconnected stories the image was telling. Hidden Folks is exactly like that, except that it is a digital hidden object game and not a jigsaw puzzle.There's something really familiar and comforting about the art style and the sound effects could not have been done any more fitting. This is something your inner child will fall in love with, no matter what your age might be nowadays.Unfortunately the game is also a bit on the short side at this time of writing. The devs are working on more content and extras, so you might want to wait for that before you decide if it's worth the full price or not. I myself thought it was even with only four hours of play, but I am glad there is more to come."
,Recommended,435400,29960656,Posted: 16 February,all,Vivvian,"Hidden Folks was truly worth the wait. A gorgeous game packed with laughs and grown men making silly noises with their mouths, the art direction is bonkers, with differents worlds filled of teeny-weeny details that make every picture come alive. Don't think the game is too easy though, some items are well hidden and it will take a thorough search to get them, the clues are helpful (and cleverly written) but don't give too much away.Funny, for all ages, visually unique, Hidden Folks is as refreshing as cold lemonade in the summer <3Seriously though, buy it."

,Recommended,435400,31544466,Posted: 4 May,all,Lyn,This is such a charming and relaxing little game. I bought it on a whim and I am glad I did.  It is essentially a combination of Where's Waldo and hidden object games.  At first the large scenes can appear overwhelming but subtle hints are also provided to help direct the player around.  The audio may get a little repetitive after a while but that is a minor quip for an otherwise adorable little game.  I never write reviews but this one deserved it in my book.
,Recommended,435400,34530530,Posted: 27 August,all,Trashbang,"One of those self-explanatory games. It's 'Where's Wally?' with cutesy sound effects, animations and artwork. You pan around, check out all the micro-narratives going on, poke stuff to elicit reactions, and search for a load of... uh, Concealed Individuals. You probably already know whether or not that's something you'd jump at.I didn't get a whole lot of time out of it before deciding I'd seen enough but eh, I was going through a miserable, anxious time. I needed something cheerful and low-stress, and I'd say I chose rather well."

,Recommended,435400,33635387,Posted: 18 July,all,Balaam's ass,"It's hard to think of something to say about this game that is accurate without just listing bullet points - so that's what I did.I guess two things that come to mind are ""kitchy"" and ""charming.""  Another two are ""infuriating"" and ""distracting.""  I think, if you're a HOGger, there's a unique experience for you here.In the HOG genre, I give this an 8 +1 for interactability as a puzzler; it's inventive, unique, and engaging, appropriate for all ages, with an increasing complexity as the scenes progress.  A parent or sitter could easily sit with an inquisitive child and have fun just looking around the scenes.Pros:-Family-compatible game, rated G.-Amusing sound effects (children and college students will like this).-You can click on all the things to see what they do - and some must be moved/manipulated to reveal hidden objects.-All hidden objects/characters give click-on clues to help locate them.-List price is less than a single admission to a movie.-Steam trading cards.-Steam achievements.-Dev gives option at game completion to join email list for future release notes.-Auto-save at exit.-Can reset all areas 100%.-Do NOT need to 100% any scene in order to progress (but there is a minimum per scene needed to progress).Cons:-If you want a fast 100% achi, guess again (though there are some very good guides).-Could not find Waldo.Sadness."
,Recommended,435400,30002444,Posted: 17 February,all,SidAlpha,"https://youtu.be/xkKXmuK_KQcHidden Folks is very much a simplistic ""Where's Woldo"" style hidden object game that proves the rule that simplicity is sometimes bliss. I'm not going to beat around the bush on this one, the game has a metric ton of charm, runs well, and is a good deal of clean fun that will entertain people of all ages.With the, I suppose you could say voice acted? sound effects, the game entertained right off the bat and, given from what I saw in my First Impressions Review has a good amount of content.I would like to remind everyone, however, that the replayability factor is quite low as there is no real randomization. But, even still, I am confident that recommending this game is the right call.8/10"

If you did too and want to revisit that joy with a challenge suited for someone of any age (but certainly still with decent eyesight), this is the game for you. What's more, the game rewards you for poking around and exploring with goofy animations and man-made sound effects for every little click.It's not a long game, but it's a few hours of silly fun. Totally worth the price. Plus, the menu hints at additional levels coming soon."

Game uses funny sounds actually done by a voice which actually add's humor to it.  The visuals are nice, and well drawn, and it's actually a good brain bending game.   Playing with more than one person actually add's to the fun and makes it more exciting to look and spot the items. At times, you can get a little bored, because it's really a simple design. There's nothing flashy about it too much. Sometimes you need just a simple game to chill out on, and this is one of them.  I recommend this game very much.

,Recommended,435400,30633884,Posted: 20 March,all,Strange,"Hidden Folks also does a great job of mixing things up. The meat of the game comes in the form of gigantic, complex scenes with around a dozen items or characters to find. They’re big enough that even playing on an iPad Pro I had to constantly zoom in and out, and pan around to find things. There are also much smaller scenes, like a simple campfire or farm, as well as one-off interactive vignettes. One such level has you helping a villager navigate a perilous path by removing obstacles.This creates a satisfying flow, so you’re not just doing the same thing — staring at a screen — over and over. Hidden Folks also removes a lot of frustration by not forcing you to find everything before you can move on to the next scene. There are no times in the game, and no punishment if you make a mistake or struggle to find something. Instead, Hidden Folks is laid back and serene, while still challenging enough to make actually finding things feel satisfying. It’s a game you can play for a few minutes or an hour and still feel a sense of gratification. And it’s the perfect companion for that Sunday morning coffee."

,Recommended,435400,29976103,Posted: 16 February,all,Sire,"Do you like Where's Waldo, cool art styles, quirky audio and chill gameplay? If yes, you'll love Hidden Folks.Hidden Folk presents you with a simple task: find stuff. Be it people, animals or objects, your objective is to find everything in the area to progress onward. Everything is done with the mouse, you click and can zoom in and out with the mousewheel. Every scene is filled with a colorful cast of characters walking about and moving, there's a lot of things that move that keep the scenes from getting dull and stagnant, it really does feel like a complicated Where's Waldo picture come to life though I haven't seen anything too crazy so far. It's all simple, but it works well. The audio is all done via voice work, so all sound effects and ""voices"" are by the same guy goofing off at his microphone but it really fits the aesthetic the game has going for it.The scenes themselves vary wildly in size and can be absolutely massive requiring you to drag the scene around even if you're at maxed out zoom. Finding things can also be really tricky, but thankfully you can click the objects in the bar and you'll be given hints and they usually give you an idea of their general location. It's really nice but even with them I've managed to get stuck. Also, you don't need to find everything in every scene so if you find a majority of things and get stuck, you can move on if you want to.Awesome game and for $8 it's a total steal. Give it a shot!"

As a hidden object game though it was VERY clever and I enjoyed the humour throughout. It's worth buying in a sale or a bundle.I will definitely recommend it though as the devs have committed to adding content, even when you finish they ask if you want them to email you when more content is added, big thumbs up to the devs for this!The noises I loved, however after a while they went from cute, to funny, to annoying, to ""lets turn the sound off"". The art style helped the puzzles. I have no arguments over the art, I loved its distinctive silly style.The gameplay gets a 10/10, for a hidden object game this had a fair chunk of easy puzzles to solve which mixed the gameplay up JUST enough to keep it interesting."

There is so much going on that it can be overhelming when you start out but the hints that the game shows are perfect for giving you something to look out for without spoiling too much. They also add a backstory to every object or person, which i thought was great since it makes the world seem more ""alive"" and not just like a picture where you have to find stuff in.The game is not too long, but new content is already announced.

,Recommended,435400,32839800,Posted: 26 June,all,The Mighty If,"This is an old-school ""hidden object"" game, by which I mean that it's more like ""Where's Waldo?"" than the modern crop of HO+ Adventures. You have a bunch of scenes, of increasing size and complexity, and within them you have to find specific people and objects, and that's it.The scenes are somewhat interactive -- you can touch things to move them, flip switches, turn dials, etc. And the things that you're looking for are accompanied by mild clues. You can also zoom in and out, although frustratingly, for the larger puzzles, you can't zoom all the way out.Lastly, it's hand-drawn with cute made-by-people-beatboxing-into-a-microphone-style sound effects.The complaints I have about the game are relatively minor. Some of the achievements seem to be at least mildly broken. A significant number of people never receive the ""All Factory Objects Found,"" even if they have indeed found all the factory objects, and thus they also never receive the ""All Objects Found,"" achievement. If you're an achievement completionist, this is frustrating.On many computers with smaller screens, the game doesn't seem to work. This might be specific to Linux, or it might just be a resolution thing. On my iMac, I was able to play the game just fine, but on my Linux-based laptop, the game wouldn't run properly in fullscreen, and when running in a window, the resolution was too low to be feasably playable.Also, there's no way for more than one person to play the game. This is the sort of game that you'll want to show your friends, but in order for them to try it (and track their progress), you'd need to reset your own game.Despite all of that, it's a super fun, charming game which provides maybe 4-6 hours of decent play for about as many dollars (depending on whether you pick it up on sale or not). I thought it was well worth it."

Some scenes are easy, and some are very large with some items taking a good bit of effort to find.  I wouldn't have thought that all the sound effects being vocal noise would be good, but it's quite well done.  And those scenes can be quite interactive, mostly in obvious ways, and there's plenty of things to come across that aren't on the list of objects to find.  Plants to grow or chop down, holes to poke at, Xs to dig up, most things to open, many things to move around.I particularly like that each object has its own hint, and they're the creative sort rather than just pointing you to where it is.  I found it can still be tough to figure out some of them.  I cleared the first two areas in three hours, of the four areas, but each area is getting more scenes and more large scenes.  No time pressure or other gimicks either, just searching around the map at your leisure.If you enjoy the hidden object puzzles, I strongly recommend this one.

That should tell you something, like to buy this game, like right now!This game is probably the best indie game I have played in a long time. It's perfect for my 4½ year old girl, and it's a joy to play even for me. But when we play together magic happens. It's also a great tool for learning how to use the mouse. It's not easy for kids with small hands to use one. But my daughter have played for a couple of hours now and she have during that time mastered the art of using a mouse. Now add a keyboard to the mix and we will have a new PC-gamer in the future. E-sport here we come!This game is absolutely awesome. With loads of maps to explore. The only negative is that you can only use one profile. They should really add multiple profiles so that people don't mess with each others progress. The only option right now is to reset all progress if you want to start a new game.The small hints you get turns into small stories that guide you forward. Sound and context helps and it's not super hard to find the hidden people. But some objects can really challenge you but luckily you don't need to find every item to advance to the next map. Some maps are really small, and others are huge. You can scroll the maps and you can even zoom in and out.

It's such a simple idea at its core of being a hidden object game, yes. But the artwork, sound design, and the realization of the ambition to create puzzles where you have to find specific folks in the middle of busy, bustling scenes, are all at their peak. Check this game out.Hidden Folks is a collaboration between  developer Adriaan de Jongh  and illustrator Sylvain Tegroeg that takes a very simple concept of being a ""Where's Waldo"" game.Then it makes everything happen in a monochromatic world, with huge canvases to explore as folks wander around, and you have to find a certain bunch of these folks. It's a simple idea, but the work that the team behind the game has done with the art, sound, and playability, makes this a fantastic experience.Hidden Folks is pretty much just a ""Where's Waldo""/""Where's Wally"" game. Your goal is to find a bunch of the eponymous hidden folks listed, or occasionally certain items. The big trick for Hidden Folks is that everything is interactive and occasional moving. Poem items will be hidden behind obstructions, or hidden in manholes. Others, you have to open up tent flaps or doors to find folks hiding from your view. Oh, and the levels become incredibly dense, too: you have to find folks scattered throughout groups of hundreds of other folks that look quite similar from your bird's eye view, especially because the game is monochrome. Oh, and there are some elements where folks will only be on screen at certain points, or you have to make not-entirely-obvious interactions in order to make the folks appear."

You often have to open doors, windows or even perform small tasks before the object appears.This is easily one of the best HO games I have played.  I strongly recommend it!"

You need to twist and turn objects to reveal stuff etc.One thing that I can't be more appreciative of is 1 of the in-game settings it has. A brightness slider.If you're like me you hate constant bright, white colours screaming at your eyes for 20 minutes straight.This game allows you to turn down the brightness, and it allows you to completely change the colour-scheme between a white background, black background, and 1 more filter that I'm not entirely sure what is but it looked like it was a blue-light filter.The art looks great, there's some funny references/easter eggs.There's no stupid timers, you're free to take all the time you want, whether it's spent actually trying to complete the levels or continuously clicking on things to listen to the sound effects.Fluff.

The game is very relaxing to play, most of the time, and my daughter enjoys doing it with me. I really like the interactivity with some of the targets. And the complete lack of timers is awesome. My only gripes are being able to reset a specific level, instead of all of them, and more medium maps would be appreciated. The larger ones aren't that fun for me.I have a confession to make. I found the noises to be more annoying than amusing. But that was an easy fix. I do appreciate the creativity of the attempt though.Update: I just did the reset and it appears that you must find the same things you found before. Still a fun game for the first time through, but this really cuts down on the replayability. I had assumed they would mix it up and randomly selecting from many possible targets on each map, but that doesn't appear to be the case. That seems like a pretty easy feature to implement to at least have a few semi-unique passes through the level for targets that don't have a complex interaction associated with them."

A nice touch is that the items you have to find come with a little hint that is supposed to nudge you in the right direction. Unfortunately, in very few cases, this description is not actually helpful or finding the item requires additional interactions which aren't exactly obvious - which can cause a bit of a headache especially on the HUGE levels.On the other hand, this could just be me, since looking at the achievement stats only about 4% of people who finish the game did not find ALL the folks and items. And even I made it eventually.It should also be mentioned that the vast majority of puzzles does not require fast reflexes making it rather suitable for children.

,Recommended,435400,34951738,Posted: 14 September,all,The Merovingian,"I haven't had the privilege of playing something this unique and fun in a while. It's very much 'Where's Waldo?' with a twist. Some folks might not like the color scheme but it's not as bad as you might think and it really in fact makes it much harder to find stuff sometimes because it forces you to look for certain clues instead of color recognition.Concept is pretty simple. Each level has a starting area which is pretty small. These areas are to help you acclimate yourself to the mechanics of each upcoming level. So basically it shows you what you can interact with and what you can expect to have to do to find all the items or people. One place you might need to ruffle some trees to knock a banana out while in another you have to perform a slight puzzle with levers to get a conveyer belt to move something to activate something else to open an area to find a guy who was otherwise unreachable. Very interesting.Along with fun mechanics and gameplay the sound design is just a wonder to listen to. Clicking on anything leads to a humorous interpretation of what the dev thinks it should sound like. From squishes to bleeps to boops they had some guy just record himself making the noises. I don't think anything was done with props. Just a guy making noises man. Brilliant.The developers are actively updating this with new levels which is awesome and I'd even go as far as to pay for new DLC with tons of new levels or a way to procedurally generate levels or something. So, would I recommend? Fuc|< yes."

,Recommended,435400,34672679,Posted: 1 September,all,Larexus,"Not gonna beat around the bush, its basically an animated Wheres Waldo/Wally game. Thats not a bad thing either, I love the art style, its simple but complicated at the same time. Theres loads of things going on in every scene, just if you look around close enough and poke in the right places theirs some hidden characters. The gameplay mainly revolves around you searching for items and characters in the various scenes, however, every once in a while their is the odd puzzle map, and though they are simple, it's a nice break to the gameplay. The game is short, I completed all the levels in around 2hrs, although their still is some items for me to go back and find. So the $9 price tag might put some people off. In conclusion, this is definitely not a game for everyone, its got good charm and I do think this is one of the better hidden object games, and if you are a fan of those or are looking for something a little more chill, this may interest you. However if you do not like this style of game, I dont think this is the one thats going to change your mind.\/---GAMEPLAY---\/https://youtu.be/vIMJrBEZh3Y"

They got so creative with this!You are provided with several ""maps"" in addition to smaller transitional maps inbetween the larger ones.You have a list of people or objects to find which come with a not-too-obvious clue, which makes it nice and challenging. The clues are pretty funny as well.Not only do you have to find these people or objects, most of the time you will have to interact with the map to open doors, curtains and other things (dont't want to spoil too much) in order to find them.Along with the game being highly interactive, you are provided with sound effects made by the mouth which are highly entertaining and had me constantly chuckling. I think the zipper sounds on the tents or the advertisement signs rolling up and down were my personal favorite.The maps are fairly large and there are tons of things going on in them. The artwork remains pretty simple but there are ever so slight differences between the people which adds to the challenge of finding characters!With the goofiness of the game, you can spend hours just enjoying looking around the map being nosey checking out what all of the people are doing while trying to find your objects. The game is challenging but never frustrating as it's just too entertaining and funny.PROS:Graphics - Very simplistic style but perfect! Works very well for a search game as many   characters look similar and there are tons of things going on in the maps!Sounds - Freaking funny and different. Loved it.Gameplay - Very interactive, not just looking for items or one-click interaction.CONS:Not enough to play. Need more. :(What I'd like to see: I got through the game in about 6 hours, but each map has so many things going on, I feel that there's room to add new search lists for pre-existing maps, as well as new maps(which I know they're already working on, yay!) There's so many things you can dink around with and objects to find, they could easily do new lists. I want to play more!I highly recommend giving it a go. It's very funny and they brought life to a ""Waldo"" like cramped world where you just want to enjoy all the little areas and see what people are doing."

,Recommended,435400,32525545,Posted: 17 June,all,✪Robbo,"I absolutely love the game. From the art style to the hints given to even the sound effects!Originally, I was a bit hesitant as I don't usually play slower, more relaxed games but I decided to give this game a shot after hearing so many good things about it from some friends.The first thing I noticed was the art style. It's got a really cute vibe to it that helps the game feel very casual and helped 'draw' me into the game. It's also good as it makes each character and item that the player is looking for unique and relatively unmistakeable.The second thing was the soundd effects. Solid 10/10. Amazing choice. All of the sound effects in the game is literally a guy just making the noises with his mouth. For a bird, he just says ""tweet tweet"". I love it and I've just had a good time listening to the sounds.Another thing that I enjoyed were the creative hints. In one of the earlier, forest levels, one of the hints given had something to do with Isaac Newton, and the character I was looking for? Hidden beneath an apple tree. It's brilliant, the clues are designed very well, giving adequate hints without making the game too easy.One more thing I liked were the small 'minigames' between the big searchig  maps. There was a small 'escort mission' where you would simply help a villager across a map by moving obsticles in their way. There are also small searching maps that introduce you to new mechanics that you didn't know existed, that helped players in later stages of the game.Finally, I likes the options and game settings. One of the things that I was hugely impressed by is the colour toggle. As someone with weak eyes that can't stare at a screen for too long, the toggle allowed the game's colours to turn from black and white to a less eye-straining beige. Although it's reatively minor, I appreciate that aspect and it improved my game experience overall.*Thing I wasn't too keen on*This honestly isn't much, defenitely too small to prevent anyone from buying the game, but I just feel that in some of the bigger maps, it would be nice to be able to scroll out completely so I can see the map in it's entirety. Other than that, it's an amazing gameTL;DR  All in all, I love the game. It's very chill with the art style, hints, funny sound effects and interesting game modes. I would reccomend people to get it as it's a good game to relax with after a long day or if you only have a few minutes to play."

I think it's incredibly cute and if you don't believe me, just watch the trailer.

I wasn't expecting it to get as challenging in later levels as it has which works out well because you get to spend a lot of time looking at all the small details that have been put into this game.  The unique black and white hand drawn look with the mouth-only sound effects is delightful.  You can come up with stories for each of the characters going about their lives as you search for the Waldo's of the game.  Definitely recommended for any casual player that likes to search for hidden things on the screen.

It is relaxing and there is some light humour sprinkled in. The sound design is amazing. All the sounds are made by mouth. The graphics are only black and white but thats alright since there are A LOT of moving things on the screen, you might feel overwhelmed at first but luckily you are given hints on where to find what you are looking for. Overall it was an  enjoyable experience abeit short (though they say ingame they are working on new areas). I definitely recommend this game"

The art and sounds are wonderfully goofy, and the clues are well written and necessary for finding everything.The game is very unique.  Some might compare it to those hidden object games that plague tablets, but is actually very different.  Rather than just clicking on everything, you often have to use the clues to manipulate the environment to coax out your targets.I hope they're be more.  The update that just came out was great (the garden fork was fiendishly difficult!); but I'm finished now and am wondering how I'll be able to go on..."

I thought I would enjoy it since I do like point and click games, but it made me extremely anxious and stressed out after the first 3 levels. It takes a lot more patience to complete than I have. You do need to click around randomly all over the place to uncover things, and because of the amount of guesswork required, each click doesn't feel rewarding but stressful to me. There are no hints except for a vague sentence.I'd recommend trying it out, but don't expect much from it."

Other reviews are used to help stress my point across but are changed in such a way to make the review in my own wordingHidden Folks is a hidden object game developed by Adriaan de Jongh and Sylvain TegroegThis is one of the very few games that I actually enjoyed playing. Finding hidden items in such a big open space is fun, challenging yet oddly satisfying. The game is fun to play in short bursts and I like that you can play it on your own or in turns with friendsThe game takes a more sacrastic tone with soem funny sound effects and music that makes it original and funny to play. The only complaint I have is the default colour scheme the games takes, it can get slightly confusing when everything is white and the only thing that is black is the outlineBut overall, Hidden Folks is a funny little game to play in short bursts!RECOMMENDED :)"

76561198095141770,Recommended,435400,31289037,Posted: 21 April,all,King Horse,"After a long & hard day of massagin’ horses, I like to lie in the back of my truck and play me some Hidden Folks.Now, don’t get me wrong; I love my job. There’s just nothin’ as fulfillin’ or as interestin’ as relaxin’ them horses.But it does get real stressful. Especially at the beginnings of the massages, when the horses don’t know what you’re doin’. Because they don’t know you. You have to show 'em long-faced creatures that you're trustworthy, first, before the touchin’ can begin. “You have to assuage it before you massage it,” as the sayin’ goes. And not every horse can be assuaged. That fact alone is stressful (as no-assuagin’ means no massagin’ can get done, which means no pay. Money ‘n’ time lost).Yeah, it’s on No-Pay days that I really need things like Hidden Folks.But let’s assume you’ve assuaged the horse. Well, there’s still potential to get stressed out.Not all horses take kindly to deep pressure massage on their big, ripplin’ muscles. And ya can’t help but think about how the horse might kick ya, or bite your groinular region. Deep tissue massage is essential to eliminate the knots in their muscles, but ya can’t help but think about the danger.[Sometimes I take a break with Hidden Folks - plus a smoke - after the deep tissue massage on the large muscles. But usually my schedule’s so packed that there’s no time for breaks]And suckin’ them horses’♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥can get stressful, ‘cause it’s an essential part of the massage (with them male horses) and you don’t know how much♥♥♥♥♥♥♥them’s got. And when one of ‘em ejaculates too much, sometimes you gag, and it causes ya to vomit. So ya gotta watch your suckin’, and switch to lickin’ the sides of them horses’♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥right before them’s ready to ejaculate, a stressful act every time that Hidden Folks helps me relax from.Worst of all, though, there’s the owners of the horses. You’d think people read the contracts they sign. Almost all the time, though, they start yellin’ an’ complainin’ when they see me massagin’ their lady horses’ hoo-hahs with my♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sometimes—and I ain’t makin’ this up—an owner goes ‘n’ points a gun at me. And I really don’t like to pull out of the horse, just to walk over (buck naked!) to the contract and (tactfully) show it to the owner’s face. But I don’t want to get shot, so I do it. And maybe you’re thinkin’ “Why don’t you just read the contract out-loud to the owner before having ‘em sign it?” Well I don’t do that ‘cause I don’t wanna come off as condescendin’ to the owners; you don’t wanna make it sound like ya think they’re not gonna read the paper they sign, which explains (in Bold Letters) that insertin’ the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥into the horses’ ♥♥♥♥♥♥s (or lickin’ ‘em if you’re a girl) is an officially-recognized massage act by the ALMAA.Anyways, my point is Hidden Folks helps me a lot. It relaxes my mind. And unlike many games it ain’t violent, and it runs on my ultrabook. I also really like the mouth sound effects that go with clickin’ on the plants and the monkeys and stuff.In fact, the only thing I don’t like about Hidden Folks are the parts that show livestock. I don’t want to click (or see) those animals at the end of the work day. I love my job, but even things you love can drive ya crazy when you’re experiencin’ ‘em too much.7/10"

,Not Recommended,435400,32840210,Posted: 26 June,all,Jazzdude,"A highly underwhelming experience. And to be honest: Pretty obnoxious as well.The idea of ""Hidden Folks"" is simply awesome. An interactive version of ""where is waldo"" (or any other search stuff game), where you have to move stuff around and have to interacte with things to actually find something. Yes sounds good on paper.However, it is bad executed. On some maps you can interact with maybe like 30 (!) % you see on screen. F.e. on the big camping map. There are so many objects you can not interact with, that it leaves you incredible disatisfied.And even when you can interact with it: 90 % of the time ""interaction"" will be a simple click. Only in one jungle level, and later from the city-levels on, you may have to hold and slide with the mouse in order to open up a garage-door, pull a lever or move a satellite. So the game is more like a click-frenzy then an acutal interactive searchgame.Also there are actually so few assets, that the game gets highly repetitive in short. The negative highlight was the ""desert map"", that is actually way to big and filled with the same bland looking spots. Don't try to defend this by saying ""it is a search game, everything has to look the same"". That is just cheap.However what made me refund the game was the atrocious, incredibly obnoxious sound design. I can not understand by any means, how anyone can find the soundscape in this game ""funny"", or ""sweet"". Just imagine a bunch of mid-30s, maybe 40s, trying to sound cute to impress some girls making ""sweet"" sounds with their mouth. Sounds creepy right? Yes it is. When I first heard the ""MEEP MEEEP"" sound of the cars I wanted to smash my ♥♥♥♥ing head against the table.It does maybe cost less then 8 € (regulary), however I can not recommend it. The ""interaction"" is a freaking joke, everything is highly repetitive, and the atrocious soundscape of this game is simply the worst I have ever listened to in a video game."

I feel as if thes game shoud really be a mobile game, not a full game for PC, although some of the images are quite large and the art insanely tiny.  Still, poking things with my finger would suit this game perfectly. I *do* recommend it, ot folks who enjoy unusual and challenging but simple games. Fans of Where's Waldo would love this."

Think of an interactive Where's Waldo where you can click on just about any object and get some sort of reaction/sound effect.It's not just simply clicking on hidden characters and items. Each character/item has a clue within it's description that certainly makes the fun of finding what you are looking for. You put the clue together and look for the location that sounds to match what the clue is describing. A lot of times it's not just simply clicking on a character that blends in with the rest of the environment. Sometimes you have to actually interact with the environment and trigger a response that will make the character/item show up so that you can find it. This is when things get more tricky than simply scanning around for the character/item. This is also what makes this a more advanced version if you will of Where's Waldo. In addition you aren't just looking for 1 guy hiding in a gigantic map but rather an assortment. I'd say it probably gets close to around 20 for the larger maps.Overall a great time passer. It kept me hooked that I just kept wanting to get through each map with no stopping. Didn't realize the hours had flown by. Certainly worth it and to support the developer. Especially if they will add additonal maps in the future.Great job overall. Sound effects are awesome, the maps have a nice art to them and the maps are very smooth scrolling despite so much activity going on within the larger maps.  Easily recommended."

You can't not fall in love with this game if you ever loved ""Where's Wally?"" books. The themed levels make them delightful to look at.The game plays well. There is a variety of puzzle sizes yet something to find in almost all of the space. Levels are designed well except for perhaps the big city level, which felt a bit too empty near the top. You can move, open, push and pull various objects. These are typically introduced via a small tutorial level. A short clue is provided for every search target, which turns every hunt into a mini-game by itself. Targets usually have strong visual clues, too, and ambient sound effects may also help. I rarely found myself completely stuck.Cons are few. Occasionally, there are minor visual glitches - people appearing behind lakes or buildings instead of in front of them, that sort of thing. These don't affect gameplay at all. The only other con is that there are few levels, and 5-6 of them are very small and simplistic. On that note...I LOVE the (free) factory levels update, and I'd happily pay for more levels in this charming game."

A splendid deal for such an entertaining and (mostly) relaxing game.As of right now, after a playtime of about 6 hours (and 1.5 hours having the game iddling in the background) I've found all the hidden folks and objects and had a blast doing so.In case you're wondering why it was only mostly relaxing: It was also really, really, really frustrating at the end, when I was looking for those tiny missing things to complete (perfect) the game. Once I was really tempted to look at a guide after searching for one particular ball for over an hour, but coming back the next day with fresh eyes really did help and I solved the mystery of the locked up ball in less then 2 minutes.As I've read in the forum, the developers are still adding new levels/areas, so I hope this keeps up for a while.Point by point:+ There's no click counter.+ There's no punishment, score deduction for simply looking/clicking around.+ There's no score.+ There's no leaderboard.+ The sounds are relaxing and hilarious.+ The descriptions on the folks and objects you have to look for are brilliant, there are puns, jokes and brilliantly hidden hints.- Only about 6-7 hours of contents as of now, since many other games at this price point offer longer entertainment it feels fair listing it as a negative+ It's very innovative for a seek and find game, i.e. not all levels follow the same logictldr;a definitve recommendation for 6 € (that's the sale price at -25%), a maybe at 8€ (maybe if there is another level adding another hour or two... how about space?)"

The cutesy hand-drawn animation makes you want to inspect every corner of the map in order to see what the tiny peeps are up to. The worlds are diverse and the maps very detailed (although to me a bit repetitive, see next paragraph). I love it how the descriptions/hints are very constructive and almost always point you in the right direction, so the game rarely gets frustrating.And, just as every other overly spoilt member of the gaming community, I'll want to point out some things I found annoying and wish were different. I think the interactions, objects and sounds get repetitive at some point. After a while, you just lose the desire to explore because it becomes too predictable. I wish there were more easter eggs and unique areas/animations and that the objects and sounds wouldn't get reused so much. Towards the final stages I was just looking to find the items and complete the chapters as fast as possible because nothing would intrigue me too much. But, I get it, this is probably a small team with limited resources, I am aware of the fact that I am expecting too much. I'm just saying it would be nice. Another thing is, all the people jumping and waving as if they want to get your attention is distracting and doesn't make much sense. It would be better if they would just do whatever it is that they're doing in their tiny little universe.I'd love to see this game evolve, possibly have sequels with color, music, etc. I hope this type of game catches on, I think we need more of this."

It's not as good as Where's Wally - there's a lot more copypaste and a lot less humour than a Where's Wally book - but the animation does lend itself a lot of charm that you don't get from static pages.Anyway, it's still fun, so no objections from me."
76561198022266051,Recommended,435400,33713479,Posted: 21 July,all,OakenPants,"Great relaxing game only spoiled by the very last levelWhat a great game.  Very cool and very well done.  It's certainly not difficult, but I had fun!You probably already know the game is somewhat of a ""where's Waldo"" in that you find objects hidden in an interactive and animated world, so I'll focus on just a couple things that helped me enjoy the game more...I liked the game better once I understood how they were introducing the levels.  When they introduce a world the map is very small.  This is to show you how objects and characters in this world interact when being clicked on or dragged which shows you how to reveal the hidden objects you're looking for.  And these methods are very much needed on the following big maps.I also enjoyed the game more when youfirst click on the objectto be foundto get a clueas to where it is; otherwise I was just clicking on everybody and everything and the game simply wasn't very fun this way.  But once I learned to first get the clue, then I could go and look for that specific item, and the game was MUCH better and much more rewarding.The only problem I had with the game is the last ""real level"" of ""Factory"" which is both too big and the clues too vague.  I simply had to go to a walkthrough guide for that level.  So that ending level was not fun at all and really spoiled what was otherwise a truly fantastic game.Despite the last level and the short-ish time to complete (~3.5 casual hrs), I still highly recommend picking this up."

Some levels also have a 'quest' in addition, such as guiding a character across a bridge by clicking on obstacles. It's simple, short, and the sound effects are incredible.I like it."

76561198106189309,Recommended,435400,33919775,Posted: 30 July,all,tinyaustinninja,"Absolutely adorable game! I really genuinely enjoyed it and cannot wait to see more levels. Its not timed and is very relaxing to me to play. I describe it to others as a really immersive Wheres Waldo? You use sight, touch (in the sense you interact with things), and sound to find the characters. The simple yet completely unique way this game works kept me playing. It never got boring!I will admit it gets pretty challenging so if you are playing with children maybe stay on the earlier levels or keep a guide handy to help them. I had to look up one solution and a tip twice myself. The solution was for something with a hint like ""3.15.4"" (i know thats probably wrong sorry) because I really couldnt figure it out and the tip I needed was that if you think you know where something is but cant find it, just zoom in and stop moving for a minute. Sometimes your eyes need a minute to adjust and take in the thing that was blending in before.I read some reviews before purchasing and I will have to say I strongly disagree with them! One said that the game gave them stress which it would have if it were timed but it is not so if it stresses you out then take a breath! You have all the time in the world and you do not have to pressure yourself to find absolutely everything in order to move on! Take it slow :). I think I am rambling at this point but that is because I am really happy about this game! It is SO GOOD!"

Loved it!Brought me straight back to my childhood days where I had a similar book (no, not Vili, or what ever you call it in your country). The book I loved was called ""Search! Find! Tell!"" or ""My big thing search"" (you will not find it with this name as its only available in specific countries in europe). Basically you had to find the things that was shown on the side of the page, where it also said what that thing was and on the big picture you saw what it did. This way you learned the name of the thing and what it was used for. An awesome way to teach children.Anyway, I guess the devs had a similar fond memory and made a game out of it. It worked :) If this was what you were after, you satisfied me and I can only recommend this game for others."

Hidden folks is a brilliant hidden object game with similarities to Where's Waldo. Except this time, it's all black and white (or vice versa or sepia, three ''filters'' to choose from to ease your vision).The incredible amount of detail is, on its own, worth a big chunk of the game time: just admiring all the work that was put into each level and every single sprite... is a delight.

This game contains huge levels, with any number of fun and entertaining situations to explore. There is a high degree of interactivity with the characters and environments. I can't imagine the amount of work that's gone into this game. That said, there is one concern I have about the game: replayability.After I beat the game, I thought I might go back and try again. I was surprised to find that all of the targets are the same. This is a huge problem. This game uses very distinct characters, descriptive clues, and clever hiding places to great effect. The downside is that upon replaying the game, you easily remember where the characters are, and finding them is no great challenge.Hopefully in the future the developer will be able to make it so that random targets can be assigned, making new playthroughs more challenging and enjoyable."

Wherever I click I hear humorous voice sound effects along with interactive animations. Hidden Folks is basically an animated monochrome Where's Wally/Waldo game. You get images of characters and objects you need to find in the bottom of your screen. Finding them all is not a simple task! As you progress in the levels the interactive scenes become bigger and bigger, sometimes little puzzles are added to the hide and seek gameplay. There are plenty of levels to explore. Another positive note is that the developers are very active. May the search for cute little sounds and characters never stop!"
