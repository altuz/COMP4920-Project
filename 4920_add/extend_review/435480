Trials of the Blood Dragon like Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon was never intended to be a successor or continuation of the parent game. If you were expecting that you should look elsewhere because you will likely be disappointed. Aside from similar gameplay mechanics Trials of the blood Dragon like Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon was supposed to be a fun departure from the main game and I believe that is exactly what they have done.I went into this game expecting what I got from Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, which was an absolutely ridiculous, over the top, stylized, comedic parody of 80s video games and action films, and that is exactly what I got. The game features anther excellent soundtrack from Power Glove which really compliments the exaggerated 80s style of the game. In addition to the new look Trials of the Blood Dragon adds new gameplay mechanics such as shooting from your bike and on foot segments. For some people these new additions may be a hit or a miss since it is a departure from what fans of previous trials games have come to expect. The bottom line is that if you go into this game expecting a Trials reskin you are going to be disappointed, for the price you get a lot of content and style for what you are paying for. Fans of Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon and its over the top 80s look should feel right at home with Trials of the Blood Dragon.Pros:Fantastic styleInteresting additions to gameplayGreat amount of content for the priceAnother amazing soundtrack from Power GloveCons:Some new additions such as on foot segments can be tedious(Subjective) A significant departure from past trials gameplay"

It's a completely fresh Trials experience. Combines platforming at some points, then goes to riding a bike whilst shooting a gun. I personally think the price is a bit too high. Within my 3.3 hours current gametime I've completed the main story as well as the extra tracks from the ubisoft rewards points and the secret ones. (Which involves finding secrets in game) £12 is reasonable, But the length feels like it wasn't worth that exact amount. If the game goes on sale eventually for a bit cheaper I would definitely recommend you pick it up. The game itself was extremely fun with an interactive storyline, good voice acting and funny cutscenes. It's a heavily story driven game with great encounters and an all round great game. Just as I said, it's not a Trials clone. So don't be disappointed if you buy it expecting that."

The theme and plot are compelling and gameplay is solid. The majority of my playing so far has been spent trying to get the highest rank possible which is really tricky. Only problems I have are sometimes the physics don't work as expected which is frustrating when almost beating your best time but then dieing because your minecart bugged out. I don't mind the platforming, at first it felt really unresponsive but after a while you get used to the movement and it really starts to flow and can be really fun."

Fantabulous,"PROS:- A lot of variety in gameplay- Interesting level designs and changes- Story has its funny moments- Great Set PiecesCONS:- Short as all hell- Pretty easy compared to other Trails games- Voice acting is BAAAAAADI was kind of surprised to see this pop up on steam, I honestly thought it was one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ rip-offs that slide in through greenlight. Turns out this is all legit and once you actually start playing the game that becomes pretty obvious. The production values for the levels are way ahead of any of the previous Trials games. With most of them featuring at least one flashy set piece.Of course the downside of that is that you end up paying more attention to the background and crash a hell of alot. In fact one of the biggest problems with the game is the fact that it mixes so many playstyles in together. In a single level you can go from driving a Tank to a motor bike to a Jetpack. Which is cool but does mean that you are not likely to get anything approaching a good time the first time through a lot of levels as you wrestle with the widely different handling of each mode.One of the other downsides to the more polished and flashy levels is the length of the game. Even with a bunch of deaths I still beat the game in about two hours. Obviously I will go back and try to ace the levels which should double the time but compared to the length of Trials Fusion this is depressingly short.Along with that the game never reaches the challenge of Fusion. You never really have to be that precise with your controls and it's only in the last level that you start to face more advanced challenges.Having said all of that there is still a bunch of stuff I have yet to do in the game outside of the story missions. There are five secret keys to find each with a clue to where it is along with rewards for acing levels.For £11.99GBP I think it is a tight little package. If you go in expecting something on the scale of Fusion then you are going to be disappointed but by the same token there are no levels in dull static warehouses to grind through. I like Fusion but it was pretty padded in some areas and this game doesn’t do that. Choosing to cut out all of the fat to give you pure spectacle."

If you want to read a review, than the first part is for you.Trials of the Blood Dragon takes two Ubisoft Franchises and mixes them together well. I had never really tried a Trials game before, and by reading other reviews, I will say this isn't the best one? However, the nods to other products, the graphics, and the gameplay are all stellar. I'm not the best at this style of game, but even I am having a blast playing it. If you were a hardcore fan of Blood Dragon and you want more in the universe, this game is for you.NOW.

,Recommended,435480,23636257,"Posted: 18 June, 2016",all,Vantier,"This game should be judged as a Standalone DLC to Trials Fusion.Gameplay wise it is basically a collection of Skill Games from Trials Fusion, with a couple of normal ""bike"" tracks.First playthrough of the game for most people would probably be about 3-4 hours.This game, as with all other trials, has leaderboards, and that is where the replay value comes in if you are a competitive person. Look to my ""total time played"" to see how much value I personally have gotten out of the game.Keep in mind that because this should be considered a standalone DLC, There is no multiplayer or user created tracks. That part of the game is still on Trials Fusion. This was done on purpose as stated by developers in order to not uneccessarily split the community across 2 different Track Centrals. So if you want multiplayer or custom maps, then you should buy and play trials fusion. If you want a collection of skill games with a storyline, then buy this.Just to make my point as clear as possible. For any of you that played Halo 3 and Halo 3:  ODST. This game is Halo 3: ODST.

This game puts the worst aspects of the game's physics engine on display through wonky platforming, shooting, grappling, and jetpacking levels to name a few. Theres very few actual trials levels in this game that do not have any of these awful levels shoehorned into them. Not to mention the game doesn't have even a quarter of the content that Trials Fusion had. There's no track central, no challenges, no skill games, no fmx, no multiplayer, and fewer overall levels. As someone who loves the trials franchise this game is a huge disappointment. I imagine fans of Far Cry Blood Dragon would feel the same. A game that somehow manages to ruin 2 franchises."

It's really fun and has some decent replay value. Eff the haters who only have 20-30 minutes on record giving negative reviews.If you honestly believe the negative reviews of this game then you should think about who you trust. People down here dissing this game for saying it's so short and easy and they only have 20-30 minutes on record. This just shows you that they haven't even started to play this game. I am an expert trials player and i just finished the game at the 3.7 hour mark. I got 100% gold or platinum on every track in trials fusion in under 2 hours. This is a really cool game and refreshing to say the least. It is certainly not a standard trials game. I was hoping for some time trial maps and expert difficulty tracks. Since this game doesn't have that it doesn't take away from it. This game wasn't meant for that. Instead of me instantly coming to write a negative review, I looked down and noticed that i wasn't a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bag so I decided to review the game for what it is. It is a VERY fun 3-4 hour game with moderate replay value down the road. If you don't like trials you should wait for a sale but if you like trials or fun, silly games pick this badboy up. In all seriousness as a trials fan I'd give this a solid 7.5/10. I'm not IGN so 7.5 doesn't mean its the worst game of all time. It's really cool. Pick it up!"

There is more to do like collect 3 more keys hidden through out the levels but honestly i have no desire after playing it through. At first glance it felt good normal stuff for trials series but then you get on foot, this is where the fun ends pretty quickly, first on foot level feels like something new to the series then 2 to 3 more in and all the sudden you realise how bad the controls feel, it is not smooth going left and right and the gun seems to not really ever aim where you want it to. And the jumping is just laughable. Do let me say the Bikeing bits of the game are solid not overly hard however which tends to get boring. The jetpack area where you have to carry a bomb lets just say i think you would be lucky to not get a score of 0 on the first try because the level appears to just be built to make you fail. I will not be recommending this game to anyone. The only good thing about it was it only taking me 3 hours to clear all levels.Beware for a short game it costs 15 dollars, you get very little content."

If you are lookig for a normal Trials game, then this title is not for you. However, if you are open to changes, then I highly recommend this game. There are a few tedious sections here and there, but you will be able to get over it and enjoy the game for what it is.Like the normal series, the Trials sections get more and more difficult throughout the progression of the game. Sadly, I felt as though it was not super challenging until the very last mission. So I blew through all of the Trials missions with ease, but I still had fun because it's just like Trials! Every other mission was either 'okay' or 'good', nothing bad to come from this game, really.I have never played Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon (FPS isn't really my cup of tea unless I'm playing multiplayer with friends), but I thought that I should probably give that a look after playing this game. The aesthetics are super nice and the music is VERY good.If I had one complaint, it's that this game is way too short. I beat this in only two and a half hours and there's no real replay ability in it. It would just be the same missions over and over again. I thought that this game would be a lot better with a level editor or something to go with it so that people can create and share their own missions. That would make me want to play this game more and more.In conclusion, this game is really fun. It has a fantastic soundtrack and a pretty vaporwave art style. I do not recommend getting this game for $15. If this game goes for sale for around $5 then you should definitely pick it up. It's short and full of adventure!"

And my god is that an awesome soundtrack, and the cutscenes are pretty cool as well. As far as the gameplay it seems to have a bunch of strangely composed levels tied together, and of course the bike ones are the best. The whole rotation of vehicles things is creative, but really the bike is the only one I've had no faults with. Right now Uplay is dead so I can't play much longer, so the only real negative is Uplay."

The music and art style was top notch and I enjoyed the shoutouts to Hotline Miami. The environments were very good and I wish they would encorporate much of it in the editor for Fusion. Also, the BMX bike was a blast from the past if you played BIke or Die.However, the shooting was not enjoyable to me nor was the jet pack sections.

Do you like absolutely awful, floaty side scrolling shooters with the worst enemy A.I. you've ever seen? Do you like pointless distracting additions to trials tracks like shooting targets instead of focusing on time and technique? Do you like weird RC car segments with frustrating controls that reverse on you? Do you like excessively intrusive story sequences in the style of esurance commercials and cheesy throwbacks to absurd 70's action movies? Well Blood Dragon wants to do all sorts of things, none of them any good and all cobbled together so you can't separate the ones you don't want to play.It's just not a good game and we could have been that much closer to a proper Trials sequel if they didn't get on this weird DLC bandwagon for introducing ridiculous internet humor inspired remixes like riding a unicorn.

The more I played the more I get frustrated by the blatant lack of actual trial gameplay, Most of them replaced by annoying platforming levels with terrible controls. It's quite a shame because you can tell they had a great time creating and designing this game and the 90s vibe is just what I like. Still If you expect a full motorbike game, don't buy this one :("

Because it sure isn't the Trials games I loved in the past. Wait until the youtube videos go up, watch a few. Then decide if you want to buy this game. Only game I've ever refunded on steam. It feels like the heart and soul of Trials games has taken a backseat to the gimmicks and flat out stupid additions to the game. Things like a story that doesn't add anything to the game, small ""comic"" like cutscenes that are interspersed in each levels. There is even a mode where you get off your bike and the game becomes a platformer with twin stick shooter elements. I just don't understand what Red Lynx was thinking when they made this game. They strayed so far from the gameplay mechanics and design that made Trials HD and Trials EVO what they were.In short, save your money now. Wait for youtube videos to get a feel for the game, then make a decision to buy. I recommend going and picking up a previous title, something like Trials Evolution."

This should be a 5Bucks DLC, but not a own game...@Redlynx/Ubisoft its realy time to do a Trials game again.Fusion, Awesome Level Max and Blood Dragon were funny, but now make an awesome game again please ."

Instead, they shoehorned it terrible platforming levels that control miserably. The aesthetic is cool, but its a shame it wasn't actually put into a good Trials game."

Oddly, yes.Certainly not a crossover anyone saw coming, and definitely not everyone's cup of tea. Despite this, I enjoyed the game greatly. Lots of setpiece level design, each one is very unique, I even saw some building techniques that weren't in other Trials games. Honestly, this isn't just a Trials game or a sequel to Blood Dragon, it's a blend of both. I recommend this if it's on sale, because I certainly enjoyed the story and cheesy writing."
,Recommended,435480,31307823,Posted: 22 April,all,kryptolojik,"This is a cross between Trials and the equivalent of an Adult Swim cartoon.  The story is the main focus.  If you came to be challenged in the latest trials game you won't find that here, this edition doesn't take itself as seriously.  The one downfall is lack of content considering the price tag.  Multiplayer is a glaring omission."
,Recommended,435480,30042421,Posted: 19 February,all,Squire of Ramsalottington,"What happens when you mix Blood Dragon with a Trials game? Something awesome!First of all, yes, the off bike sections are clunky, 2D platforming obviously isn't RedLynx's specialty. But that's fine! The best part of the game is the whacky disjointed story told through fantastic animated cutscenes and in level dialogue. If you played Far Cry Blood Dragon you should have a good idea of the tone of this game, however while that was more a parody of R rated action movies this one is more PG 13, even comedically censoring itself at times.The on bike / mine cart / truck sections are quite entertaining, there's some mindfreak sections, there's cool environments to go through, and there's insectoid aliens to murderize. But you never know when you'll switch mode of transportation mid level and I really have no interest in trying to set good scores on platforming that's primarily difficult because the controls are bad (eg. landing one foot on a platform means you bounce off and potentially fall to your death). But again, I still think it's worth at least running through once for the story, it's so delightful and I guarantee it will make you smile."

I tried reinstalling everything, didn't help, tried a week later, still the same... contacted Ubisoft support, no help since they think there's something wrong on my PC (when everything was fine before their stupid update).I could still play the game, but I can't save, so whatever, uninstalled it."
