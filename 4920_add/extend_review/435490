It may not necessarily be a game you can spend hours at a time in (though it might be, depending on how much you like arcades), but there's always something to come back to for a quick play.10/10, would spend 15 minutes yelling at a claw machine again."

Then, I get a vive, and now My dreams have come true. Perfectly modelled machines which play exactly how they should do, but with amazing score tables including local and worldwide charts, far better than you'd ever see in a real arcade. And how much for this dream come true? Six quid! It's absolutely mental, surely the bargain of a lifetime. I would happily pay £10 per additional machine they added to the arcade, but they're going to keep it growing for FREE! So far I've had over ten visitors to my arcade, and everyone, young and old, has enjoyed it as much as a trip to the seaside.VR was made for experiences like this. It'll keep you fit too, I've thrown more basketballs today than I ever have in the real world. Now, should I take this opportunity to suggest they add a coin pusher/flippa winna next? Amazing work guys."

When Pierhead launched, the multiplayer as IP-based and barely functional, and it didn't have that many games to play. Now there's a ticket and prize system, functional co-op, probably twice as many games as it had at launch, and still frequent visual updates, like the recent Halloween update. The game is a pretty simple concept that might not be all that fun alone, but if you've got a friend with VR it's a lot of fun just playing around in the arcade."

,Recommended,435490,24036510,"Posted: 2 July, 2016",all,arleas,"Review Edited!This is a VR recreation of one of the old Boardwalk style Arcades from the 80's (or maybe earlier in the case of some of the games).The Games include:Skee-ball (called Rocket ball)Whack a mole (I forget what it's called but they use dinosaurs and cavemen)a game where you use boxing gloves to punch targets as they swing out in front of youA shooting galleryA crane game (complete with frustration as the crane drops whatever you're trying to get multiple times)A game sorta like Beer Pong crossed with Tic Tac ToeAnother game where you hit big buttons as they turn white (avoiding the red ones)A game (Rapidfire) where you toss balls into holes as they light up for varying points (1, 10, 50, 100 I think)(Carob toss) A game where you throw balls trying to land in an urn for 1000 points, and failing that, it rolls into various holes for various points.Bowling (but you only play half a game)a game where you slide weights down a lane which scores points based on where it stops.Some other games that aren't easy to describe quicklyThat's a lot to do.  They've got some drink machines that you can now open (though it doesn't show that it's open, you can hear the sound though).  After you open the drink you can pour it into your mouth almost like you're drinking it.  Kinda pointless but I guess it's there for accuracy.There's also a ticket turn-in booth for prizes.  You earn tickets based on your scores.  Score really well and you earn a ton of tickets.  Score really poorly and you only earn a few.  After you turn in your tickets for prizes, there's a ""prize corner"" where you can store them.All of the games are very ""kinetic"" meaning you need to use those vive controllers to grab the balls and throw/roll them, and you have to start each game by putting money in the machines.  Unfortunately, a lot of these games don't have that realistic feel of actually handling the ball as you roll it down the skee-ball lane. Fortunately you have an endless supply of coins so when you screw it up, you can keep practicing.Of course since you DO have infinite money, the games of chance (like the crane game) just turns into ""how long am I going to stand here and keep trying?""You can adjust several settings outside and inside the arcade.  For example, you can make it so you're taller or shorter in game.  You can turn up the super sampling to make the graphics look better as well as the general graphics quality.  There IS multiplayer, so you can easily set up a server and invive friends (provided you have friends who have a Vive).They've improved the movement so that in addition to the circles to teleport into, you can change a setting to allow you to teleport anywhere.   The developer is doing a lot of work to improve and this game has changed a lot for the better in the past month or two.  I am extremely happy to see that the developer is continuing to flesh out the game.Things I liked about the game:It reminds me of going to Chuck E Cheez and/or Dave & Busters and trying to win enough tickets for a gameboy or something.A lot of the games are really authentic in design and feel (minus feeling the weight of something in your hand and feeling friction as you roll it).It has a lot of potential to be an awesome game when more people own the Vive and can play online.There's a decent variety of games to playBenefits greatly from lots of Room space to move in (but seated or standing is OK probably)You can adjust the height of your player so that either you can feel like a giant, or a midget/child, or accurately refect your own height.Things I didn't like:Some stuff in the game is more for looks than functionThere's an Exit game button but it just lets you out of the arcade to the ""main menu"".I haven't had a chance to try multiplayer.Having to type your name in the local leaderboard every time.  Why not let it set a name and just use that... or use your steam name?I think this is one of those games that unless you actually remember going to play the games in the arcades, you probably won't care too much about it.  Watch some gameplay videos before buying so you can make up your mind if it'll be fun or not.  It's still pretty physical though so you may wind up burning some calories as you frantically try to throw balls in the time limit.Overall though it has a lot of potential to be great in the future. They're still updating the game and improving it."

This is despite it being in early development. If it continues to be fleshed out and more activities added over time honestly I think I would have been happy paying as much as $30 for it.As it stands, at time of writing I do recommend it at it's full current price tag. Early access or no the content is solid. I've experienced no glitches or bugs and every activity available in the game lived up to my expectations of it. To clarify, that means I got frustrated with things like claw machine, precisely when you would expect to be frustrated by a claw machine. :-PThe attention to detail is fantastic. Playing with the machines gives you tickets which you can spend on prizes, which are just mere decorative objects, but in fact whole new toys you can interact with. I'm very much looking forward to spending more time with the multiplayer so can play with more of the prizes with my friends.All the machines themselves offer all the variety of leaderboards you would hope for. I'm also pleased to see the variety already present in the machines. The majority of them revolve around the pick up and throw ball mechanic but it's impressive how many different creative ways this mechanic is been applied to create different machines.There are many arcade classic I hope to see added. The possibility for more content to be added as is just even more reason to buy it to support the developer and encourage further development. But even as it stands Pierhead Arcade is worth buying for it's current content. If you own a Vive this is a must purchase in my oppinion.Edit: After writing this review when trying the multiplayer capabilities with a friend I encountered some bugs for the first time. I went on the discussion forums and outlined the bugs. Within an hour the dev has responded and before I even had time to notice they had published 2 hotfixes that fixed the issues I described. Highly commendable and worth noting."

The few minigames in Pierhead Arcade are satisfying and that's mostly thanks to the sound design. Everything behaves and sounds like you would expect it. If you're not into early access games, I'd advise waiting until this gets a more polished interface and better multiplayer support. The 3D environment is also visually simple compared to the great design that went into the arcade machines.Finally, it's a very well built product at its core that mostly needs work on the visual assets to make it feel like a complete experience."

Thankfully, my Vive controllers always seem to have another quarter to pump into each machine, so the fun never ends.A nice added bonus is the inclusion of local and global top scores, allowing you to compete with your family and friends, or see how you stack up against the rest of the world, at each game in this title.I highly recommend this for anyone who's looking for a VR experience that they can come back to again and again and blow off a little steam between their AAA games.Great for the kids in the house, too, though you'll probably have to teach them how to put a quarter into the box...

Combine that with pretty consistent updates and extra games added means it's well worth the money. If you have a vive you should buy this gameOnly small downside i can think of is they could do with a bit of an addition to the movement system so you could tweak exactly where the machine is within your room space. some of the punching machines end up close to my monitor, so it would be good to be able to shift them over a bit as needed rather than the locked in one spot system, which itself works perfectly if you have plenty of space.

I wish bowling was... but without the mass there... the ball really just takes off in random direcitons!Suggestion: Use the direction formed by the majority of the arc... not the end when the trigger is being released... I'd filter the entire trigger release out of the calculation... and reach WAY back into the swing to average datapoints that way.  OR perhaps allow the trigger on the OPPOSITE controler to work the release.  That way the act of releasing doesn't disturb the arc of the swing.This is a quality game... and the attention to detail is just fantastic.  Well done devs!"

Do you wish you had infinite tries at the claw machine?  If so, this game is for you!I picked it up during the Steam Sale a month or so after I bought my Vive, and this is one of my favorite VR experiences in my collection.  All the games are very well done with realistic physics, interactive buttons and coin slots, flashing lights and sounds, score boards, etc.  Other than having a Vive wand in your hand, it really does feel like you're standing at the machine and playing the games with your own hands.  Objects respond just as you expect them to.  My favorite games in this collection are Rocket Ball, Arctic Shuffle, the shooting galleries, and the claw machines, though all the games are enjoyable.Rocket Ball is just re-branded Skee Ball, and having played real Skee Ball at an arcade recently I have to say it is a very good simulation of the real thing.  It helps that the Vive controller has similar weight to it as a real Skee Ball ball does, and the ball responds to your motion realistically.  It's just as difficult in this game as in real life, but you don't feel like the simulation is getting in your way either.Arctic Shuffle is a game I've never seen in a real arcade, but it's a fun concept and plays well.  The goal is to slide a puck down the ice and get it to stop on the highest scoring point zone without it falling off.  The physics again work very naturally and changing the velocity and direction of your movement responds accurately in game.  It's tricky, but when you get one on the 10,000 point zone it's super satisfying.  Puck collision works as expected too.The claw machines are also a lot of fun.  I've never been one to waste away quarters in real claw machines, but having infinite quarters to free a virtual stuffed bear from his virtual captivity has occupied more of my time than I care to admit.  The physics respond well, though you only get two motions on this claw machine - forward and right.  You have to time your button presses correctly to line up the claw rather than a joystick like many real world machines have.  The toys fall out of the claw just as you'd expect, too.The games I feel are the least realistic are the basketball, bowling, and whack-a-mole games, mainly because the controller weight and size just don't feel right.  Bowling reminds me a lot of Wii Bowling given the controller size and weight.  It's fun but not necessarily realistic.  Basketball just feels awkward when you're using one hand to throw the ball.  Dino Whack also feels too fast-paced without the heft of a big foam mallet and the feel of whacking dinos IRL.  Still fun, and done as best as they really can given the limitations of VR.I'd like to see more games added, even if they were sold as DLC.  There's a lot of potential here.  It would also be nice to see public online lobbies similar to how Rec Room operates to make the arcade feel more lively.  If you're just solo playing it feels like you're wandering around a dead, abandoned arcade even though the background sound effects indicate a lively, busy arcade with machines making noise, people talking, etc.Another thing would be to have a way to teleport game objects back to the machine they came from if you accidentally fling them across the room.  I've lost the little boucy balls for the cannonball toss game many times, same with the scarab toss and basketball games.  They respawn in the machine if you put a new quarter in, but then you lose your points.I also noticed a glitch with the claw machines - if you put a new quarter in while the claw is retreating back to its home position, you can push the buttons to move it.  However, letting go of the buttons it will keep moving back to home.  It gets annoying.  It shouldn't let you move the claw until it resets to its home position, even if you put in a coin while it's moving back."

They got bowling now.Here is a video for you to look at if you want to see the game. It will be ready after upload. HD will be ready after YouTube processing. Enjoy:https://youtu.be/AW8zeYIwuJM

My opinion hasn't really changed. Yes, the warehouse is full now, but they are all DUPLICATE games. It would be nice if you added NEW games. Also, please add force feedback to the controllers for the Whack A Mole game -- it's really ridiculous that there is no vibration when you whack the mole -- force feedback would definitely improve and refine the experience. I'll recommend this title once you increase the amount of games and add controller vibration to whack a mole.Not much to do in here. Had a hard time figuring out how to start the game play. Had to select a network setting first and then was able to teleport -- this seemed very unintuitive. Hopefully they will add some additional games. There are some interesting games but overall, the warehouse is 2/3 empty. OK for the price but can't recommend until they fill the warehouse with more games."

Gutted because i bought this game as a demo for work and it just stopped working :(UPDATEAfter dev comments, game now works.""If you turn around there is a player scale option, it defaults to 1."""
,Recommended,435490,28963704,Posted: 2 January,all,schnelle,Developer helped me with issue after emailing. I had to hold down alt (or ctrl) when launching game from the file explorer to get the Graphics options to come up. Then I switched to lower settings and disabled supersampling. After that I could put graphics back on max and play with no issue.I actually had quite a lot of fun playing this game and I regret that I forgot about my negative review for so long.

Going in to it i didn't have high expectations, i mostly bought it because it was heavily discounted in summer sale. However this is one of the hidden gems of VR. I recommend you to buy it even if you are not into arcade'ish stuff. The bowling aspect reminds me of Wii Sports which was a great game back in the day... :)"

Also, it's fun to take the bowling ball, rifle, and such and drop them onto the other games. : P (something you can't do in real life)Also, I use it with Oculus Touch, and it works fine. The issue the other reviewer mentioned must be fixed by now."

You're not going to get 100 hours out of it, but it's a great game to dip into every now and again and to show off to people new to VR."
