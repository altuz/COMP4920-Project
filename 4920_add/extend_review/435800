For those who like their puzzle games on the head-banging side of difficult then this is for you. Fantastic level design and a charming concept. Binaries is a maddening bundle of fun!"

,Recommended,435800,22238817,"Posted: 4 April, 2016",all,Titanic21,"I want to be honest from now on...I just wrote this review to show everyone that I have been the very first person to buy Binaries on Steam.The original review has been deleted in order to write this here.As you can see, I don´t even own the game anymore; I refunded it because it wasn´t worth its money for me.I am not trying to say this game is bad, actually it´s the opposite! I love the mechanic, which makes this as hard as it is. The jokes are... well, let´s say they could be better. I think 9,99$ are way too much for this, but ""Binaries"" is pretty nice and I want at least to support the developers by writing a positive review. I will rebuy this, as soon as it´s cheaper, promise.I am sorry about this guys. Just couldn´t stand it any longer not telling you all I should."

,Recommended,435800,31271937,Posted: 21 April,all,LonM,"This is a great puzzle-platformer. The core part of the game that makes for difficulty is the fact that you basically have to control two chracters at once, but with the same controls. You need to be able to either (or both) plan in advance and quickly react to dangers faced by both the characters.The art in this game is simple, and goes well with the soundtrack. The levels are easy to understand (as in, you can quickly identify where the dangers are to plan for them), but definitely not easy to beat. The addition of a timer adds to the difficulty quite well.Good game, definitely plays best with a controller, and I would say there are the right amount of levels to let you swap between if you get stuck on one in particular."
76561198064811534,Recommended,435800,30224586,Posted: 27 February,all,melicore,"if one word can describe binaries its ""FRUSTRATINGRIGHTINTOHELL"".do not mistake the primitive graphics or simple game design for an easy game. IT IS NOT.you will find yourself yelling,  crying and the desire to hit something when you die just when you think you ve got it.tha game is simple and yet great.you need to get from a to b using 4 keys the problem is you have two things you are moving a blue ball aaaaaaand an orange ball the problem is they move at the same time making it a bit difficult to get from a to b.can it be done?????? Yes it can but it takes time cordination and most importent ........ PATIENCE.And i love it.enyoi it and sorry about my english."
76561197998690550,Recommended,435800,34975476,Posted: 15 September,all,LaowaiGamer,"One of the tags for this game says “difficult”. Normally it would mean avoiding lightning-fast sawblades, navigating penny-sized platforms that executing pixel-perfect moves. Not here though – all jumps are easy, deadly sparks are rather slow and timing in general is quite relaxed. But make no mistake, this game IS difficult – for a totally different reason. All those jumps and dodges you’ll have to do, you do for two (or more) balls simultaneously. With only one set of controls to do it.You ever heard of how difficult it is to simultaneously “tap you head and rub your tummy” or “draw circle with one hand and triangle with another”? That’s exactly the skill this game will put to the test. This is multitasking brought to the extreme, this is the ultimate twofer, this is the stone to kill two birds with.Level design definitely deserves a praise too. With 101 levels, developers really explored the concept of simultaneous control to the fullest, finding time and time again in what particular way it goes against any instinct you had so far.Add minimalistic, but very clean design, simple, but appropriate soundtrack – and you not only swearing and breaking your keyboard, but doing it in stylish and relaxing environment.All in all – “Binaries” is puzzle platformer with rather unique twist in it for those who have seen it all. Sure, you have defeated Dr. Fetus or whoever it is the hardest platformer boss out there. This time your enemy is your own brain. Fight!"
