Like that game and the VIVE, this was kind of a first party game for the OSVR headset, which I find interesting. Likely to go on sale alot and be a steal for $2.49. Compared to SPT, everything is a bit more alien though. It's got almost the same level of graphical fidelity and visual quality, but the effects and overall presentation is just very flaccid in comparison. No offense! The sounds are weird, especially with the guns. They very much make a 'pew-pew' sound. The enemies are more like silly space invaders rather then the scary death robots of SPT. It's been 261 days since the last update so that's basically it. It's fine.What does the name mean? Oh, duh, lookit that, it's so it sorts to the front of a search. Ha!http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=898132820"

If you want to shoot, but don't want to dodge, then check out A-10 VR!"
,Recommended,436220,24005487,"Posted: 1 July, 2016",all,arleas,"This game gets my thumbs up, but it's not a ""big up""If you read my review for ""Space Pirate Trainer"" this game is almost the same thing... but not as well done.  Actually, there's way more game modes so I guess there's more potential here.  It could use some more polish for sure.Basically, you're put on a floating platform in a ""space"" kind of environment surrounded by a series of blue portals (not like the ones from the Game portal though).  Each of these portals can spawn enemies and also provide a way for enemies to exit the area.  Once again you've got two guns with different firing modes, but no shield this time.Each gun has only two modes... a precision laser and a plasma firing pistol.  The gun sights are big and thus easier to see to aim as well. The difference here between this game and SPT is that you have a finite amount of ammo and you have to aim downward to reload (like the old arcade light gun games).   SPT handled this by giving your weapons a ""battery"" that slowly recharged as you stopped firing so you never had to stop and reload.  Reloading takes the focus off the action, though to be fair, waiting for a slow recharge is worse (when your weapon is down to zero charge).Anyway, it's still fun, but it feels more like target practice than defending a point.Things I liked about this game:It's like the light gun games of the late 80's and 90's.The gun sights are actually worth using in this game (I guess they're bigger and that helps)There's powerups that do stuff like add bonus points and slows time downGame modes include Survival mode, Time Attack, Practice and Attack mode (where they actually shoot back)Things I didn't really like:Music wasn't memorableI'm not a fan of having to reload, especially when one gun only gets 10 shots and the other gets 30.this game has more going on behind you than SPT did, so you may find yourself twisted up in the cable as you turn around and around.For the most part, the action was a lot slower in this game so it took a lot longer to build up to excitement.It's still a fun game, but if you had to pick between this game and Space Pirate Trainer, I'd say get Space Pirate Trainer."

The weapons are simple but with a great feeling of power. One is a one hit instagib type railgun, the other is a slower full auto plasma gun.The way to get high scores is by not missing so put the railgun in your dominant hand and when you have time line up your shots for maximum combo scores. When things get out of hand (and they do, oh boy they do) spray and pray with the plasma gun.Its a simple game with no story and very little depth, but for the same price as a pint this is amazing value for money. Well done dev for putting a realistic price on your title. And well done for making something that is polished and perfectly playable.9/10"

My VR library is at nearly 50 titles now and I have to say that this is easily in the top 10% of what I play. It is very simple to play making it easy for newcomers to VR to enjoy. There's no real ""movement"" going on, so it is very unlikely to make anyone feel queasy.The only downside is that it is ""the thing you do"" forever. It will get harder, sure, but you'll be doing the exact same thing - shooting flying targets. Still, between guests and my roommate and so forth, I've gotten my money's worth several times over.Overall, if you like Space Pirate Trainer, then you should probably buy this game as it's somewhat like it.

Grabbed it in Steam summer sale and compared to other VR games the game is very low priced for what you get.I own Space Pirates as well and I like the graphics in A-10VR even more. However, when it comes to gameplay, still Space Pirates is more fun for me. The reason is simple: A-10 VR gets too fast too difficult! Enemies come from all sides and are very fast, which is ok with only a few of them at the same time, but after 2 - 3 minutes playtime, it is getting very chaotic and confusing. I feel it is not even possible to kill all the drones on screen, as the weapons have not enough ammo and the (cool) reload function takes a second or so, as you have to lower the gun and then aim back. Drones are popping up way quicker than I can kill them.I would recommend different difficulty settings with either less drones simultaneously or simply a reduced game speed on ""Easy mode"". In addition it would be better if not so many enemies pop up as the level continues, but the enemies get harder, so one can play a bit more strategic.However, still the positive points are much more than the negative ones, so i do not regret the purchase at all and hope the developers will tune the gameplay a bit and offer some kind of optional casual difficulty level. Currently it is tending to get frustrating when after every 3 minutes a game over pops up. I play shooters since many years and I am not bad playing most of them in hard difficulty, but it is simply much quicker to aim with a mouse than with the whole body & arm."

You probably spent a lot of time telling other people what god wants from us, though you've ""never personally spoken to a girl"".Can I curse here? ♥♥♥♥ all y'all.OK! Now that this is off my chest, go buy this when you can. It's brilliant. BRILLIANT!This is one of the best - most straightforward VR games there is.

Something about the survival mode kept me coming back. It might have been that the top score on the global leaderboard seemed within reach but I actually think it has more to do with one element this shooter doesn't have that many similar Vive titles do: it doesn't tangle your cable up. There are so many great room-scale shooters out there but after playing them for a while the damn Vive cable gets tangled into knots. With this game the action mostly happens in front of you so you're not constantly turning to hit things coming from behind. This might seem like a negative, as it makes the game less intense, but it makes definite sense in the real world. Also its simplicity actually works in its favour as it a nice first step into VR shooters and a good game for friends to experience if it is their first time in VR.The game is a steal at its full price and I've had as much fun playing this as any other wave shooter VR game. I'm not going to argue and say it's the best of its kind, but when you take into consideration the price and the fun factor its well worth a purchase. I've left my original review below in case you are interested in what I thought of the game after the first half an hour.ORIGINAL REVIEWOnly had a couple of goes on this game and I've had my money's worth already. At £3.99 I think this game is great value. The sense of immersion is wonderful and I really felt like I was standing on that platform blasting all those ships and orbs whizzing past. The only negative was that the guns weren't quite as accurate as I would have liked but I read, after quiting the game, that the gun angle can be adjusted, so I'll make sure to do that next time I load up the game.My thanks go out to Futuretown for making one of my first experiences in VR so enjoyable. I look forward to your upcoming games."

Enemies move between portals that are placed 360 degrees around you.  The survival modes can get pretty hectic."
,Recommended,436220,28793446,"Posted: 29 December, 2016",all,Skelter,This game keeps it simple in all the right ways. The timed mode is a rare mixture of relaxing and focused. The survival mode can get panicky as the scale of the impending ships/bombs get close. All in all a great value.

This is basically that.If you're interesting in improving/maintaining your situational awareness, hand-eye coordination, and reflexes: pay the $4.99 and start blasting things.  10/10.If you're looking for some kind of story line or something, probably not what you're looking for."

Powerups, true 360 gameplay, a great scoring system, varied enemies and game options with leaderboards for each.Want to point out a ""glitch"" (I think) where both pistols become fully automatic. Holding the controllers together, or switching controllers between hands will sometimes cause this to occur. I was able to double my score using dual auto pistols."

A very entertaining little arcade shooter with hours of fun to be had. As others have mentioned it's very much in the mold of Space Pirate Trainer but perhaps lacks some of that game's polish. That said for the price being asked this game should be owned by anyone who has a Vive.

You are equipped with a laser rail gun and a laser machine gun for each hand.You stand your ground on a platform that is the same size as my playroom , not sure if that is coincident, but it's very nice because you can move around freely always knowing where your boundaries are just by staying on that platform.3 modes of gameplay, 2 modes you are shooting and nothing is shooting back at you other than missle every now and then.   The 3rd gamemode, 'Attack Mode'  is just awesome.  It has the robots shooting lasers at you and it is so much fun dodging and shooting at the same time.  I got 12th on the global leaderboards on my last run, and was just sweating buckets by that point in the game :)Awesome arcade shooter for cheap."

,Recommended,436220,33819748,Posted: 26 July,all,123,"I bought it for $5 and I would say it was definitely worth it. It' simple but fun. The timed and survival modes don't really require you to move at all besides turning, which is perfect for beginners or if you just don't feel like moving around. Attack mode has you dodging lasers as fast as you can, which I thought was pretty fun. It would be a good game to show to gamers who've never used VR before. Also it lets you adjust the angle of your guns so you can choose how how your wrists will be positioned while aiming, which is a nice feature to have."
,Recommended,436220,34184567,Posted: 11 August,all,MysticK,"This is a game that I keep coming back to because it's very simple, easy to learn, but difficult to master, with short game times that present fun and challenges all along the way.  Unlike other shooter games, A10 is less complicated, with less weapons and options, but this doesn't in any way diminish the playability and fun.  A more popular game in this genre is Space Pirate Trainer, but I think A10 is much better."
