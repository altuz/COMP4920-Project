Sitting in front of the keyboard gets a bit lame when you see the full potential this game has.Also, you are not able (yet) to set your own keybindings, finding the ""B"" button usually ends up frantically hitting every key you find over the spacebar while wearing the Vive Headset.Vive controllers should become the left and right ""controller sticks/armrests controllers"" that connects to the Thrusterpack of your spacesuit.Lifting/tilting the Vive Controllers then interacts as the joystick.I recommend this game if you know where your keys are on the keyboard.Else you should wait for the Vive Controller support, that would certainly give this game a big 8/10 from me."

I feel good playing the game but I understand why some people can not cope. Do one barrel rolls - feel the softness in your legs.Unreal 4 does a great job with graphics. I'll try multiplayer mode today.
,Not Recommended,436230,32014158,Posted: 28 May,all,JEL,"A game with a lot of potential, ruined by a silly arcade game-play (do this in 40 seconds or DIE! Shoot that in 20 seconds or DIE! Oxygen that last minutes and turns the whole thing into a stress-experience rather than an exciting experience. All in all it's designed for kids with some type of attention-disorder (you know; those boys girls hate because they do everything too fast for any enjoyment to arise). There's just no time for any fun in this game. It's all about ""Hurry, hurry HURRY!! You slouch"" (The game literally calls you a slouch, after you just paid them about 26 US$. Of course it's an in-game joke, but it sets the tone for the whole thing: there's no time to enjoy anything and that makes this game a loser-experience IMO))If you like that type of 'instant gratification' game, then you might find it perfect.Graphics are quite good, control is ok (I preferred the mode called ""VR thrust"" using the Vive controllers. There are other modes but they were too coarse for me to master (total spin-fest with those) with no way to adjust fine-control)The game also has power-ups (more speed, so you have even less time to enjoy anything), and rockets (cause obviously little kids these days are only happy if they get to blow stuff up), and shields (so you can be invincible like iron-man or batman or whatever super-hero you prefer (cue the silly cartoon in the beginning, which I could have happily lived without), cause just being in a space-suit is obviously not enough)There's a lot that goes wrong with this game-play (if you're looking for a simulator-type game, which this turns out NOT to be)There are, however, a lot of potential. But it's wasted unless you're looking for a fast-paced action-game.Also, story-wise, you don't feel connected to the story at all.Some event happened, that broke a lot of stuff (Did a colleague do it, or what was 'the finger' all about? I didn't get the meaning of that). Some dude talks to you on the radio, but we don't even know his name.Everything is just so rushed :(The music is nice, but since I was too slow in doing things it ended up repeating itself in a noticeable way, so in the end it didn't really work too well. It tried to set an ambience, and it got close at times, but it felt like it was programmed for a pace of game-play much faster than I was playing at (And so it repeated itself. That's what you get for being a slouch apparently)I'm sorry to be so nasty here, but the video gave me a very different impression than I got from the actual game-play. Not that the video is wrong, what you see is indeed what you get, it just gave me the impression that this was a slow-paced half-way simulator-type game and not an arcade-game on steroids.The game is well-made technically and ran smooth on the GTX980 I have (on an i7 pc), so kudos to the developers for that. Very smooth running visually.It also looks good. Lighting and shadows. All that is brilliant.Sounds are good. A mix between being simulator-worthy and arcadia-fest nonsense, but with no glitches.So technically this game is very good (The 'drifting' helmet-position annoyed me a lot though, but I'm not sure how the developers can avoid that since the game obviously can't allow the player's free VR-movement to cause his/her head to stick outside the helmet. It's not a big deal, but it did annoy me having to reset the helmet-position every time I had looked around just a little bit. Maybe they discovered what is really a VR-limitation here; the trouble with small confined spaces)I really wanted to like this game, but rather than bring me fun it brought me frustration.If you're a simulator-type, I don't think it's for you.If you're an arcade-type, it could very well be for you.The game is not at fault, it is what it is, I just thought it was more like a simulator-experience allowing you to set your own pace in the game, but it isn't and it doesn't."

I mean REALLY nice, even on my 970, Also with my Iron stomach i was able to handle the movement while seated (seriously playing this game standing up is a terrible idea) Reason for the refund was the Vive controls. those i will have to admit are terrible. I would consider buying this game again if i get a HOTAS in the future. Or if the Vive controls were revamped completely and somebody made a video/write up explaining how the controls are better.TLDR: great performance on minimal spec VR rig, great visuals. Terrible controls for motion controllers"

I have not gotten sick from any other vr experience untill this game. It looks awesome and probably is, but it's beyond my threshold as of now.I hope that I can try it again in the future, but for now I am refunding it since it is impossible for me to play more than a few minutes before having to run to the toilet and throw up.I recommend it if you can handle it.

,Recommended,436230,31841589,Posted: 19 May,all,rinks361,"I don't normally get motion sickness but this game can pull off some of the worst nausea inducing motions out of any game that I've played. I can sit down fine and play games like Elite Dangerous and Star Citizen in VR and not get sick, but this game brings it on quickly. Sitting down in a chair while your character is boosting forwards, moving your head around and doing rotations and angles is dizzying and I imagine that this is what it would be like in actual space.I find that it helps to have a fan blowing on you and taking deep breaths regularly while closing your eyes (for some reason I hold my breath a lot in this game) helps to curb some of the nausea, but after about 30-40 minutes into the game I had to take a break just to get my equilibrium back. If anyone has the stomach and mind for this game, I definitely recommend it. The gameplay is fun and the atmosphere and music is amazing."

The motion sickness isn't as bad as Adr1ft, but it could affect some people. Just don't let yourself spin all over the place. There are easy to use brakes for your forward and rotational thrusters. There's an arcade control mode that makes it easier to control, but I prefer the astronaut control mode because you tend to drift and spin more, and I prefer that for realism. There are places where you get launched really fast, and they can be a little frustrating because you may have trouble braking or steering yourself and might end up ramming into a solid object and dying, which sometimes sends you spinning (not good for motion sickness people). When you first leave the space station and enter the void of space, it's an amazing feeling."

I can hardly explain how amazing it was to fly out into space for the first time and simply float there.

I figured if I write a review, why not start with this game.I own a fair amount of titles in vr. This is the most intense game I`ve ever played. So intence(motion sickness) that after I play this. When I go to another vr game that usally gives me a littledizzyness, there is none at all. Which is strange......The trick to Detached is small movements at first.Just take your time and get used to the enviroment and movements.The details are really good in this game. its like your really in that suit..........The only con about the game every now and then the game can get a little choppy. Dropped frames sometimes.Im running 2 1080 gtx cards (Titan gt83vr-6rf) The cards are not M cards. But I do know its still not like having the desktop equvilent. But out of 20 games in vr this is the first time I`ve experenced this. I will say when playing Detached the right gpu fan is ramped up like crazy. But the left gpu fan is basically at idle......and with settings turned downits still there. But its not that bad. Just took some time to get used too.......because I do like this game. I would say the best title I`ve played yet.Great Game. Can`t wait for future updated. Thanks"

,Recommended,436230,33424573,Posted: 10 July,all,[WK] Keragon,"Absolutely amazing.  While the game dosn't fully make you feel like you are in zero G because you can still sense yourself standing in gravity, it gets pretty damned close.  It's impossible to not get fully immersed while you are playing and feel like you are actually there, floating around.  Detatched takes the VR experience to the level we all imagine it.  Not only do you feel like you are reaching out and can touch things, it does so floating around...  Which is at least what I imagined the VR experience to be like.The controls are excellent and easy to understand.  After a little practice it starts to become very second nature navigating with them.  The game play so far and story is progressing nicely with interesting puzzles to solve.  I'm excited to strap the headset on try the game again, and I can't say the same for a lot of VR games.  The fit and finish in the game is on par with what a person expects out of a game nowadays.  So many VR games are so bad, or so short that it really leaves me not wanting to try others.Graphics are great, and the screen door effect becomes almost non noticable once you start playing with how they have done the visuals.  Absolutely amazing game, a must have for any VR owner.A word of caution however!  This game is VERY nausiating.  I don't get motion sickness very easily and this game pushed my limits, I could only muster close to an hour before I needed a break.  Try not to play to the point you puke or you won't want to play again!"

I did not vomit, and i have a high tolerance for motion sickness, but this brings the entire motion sickness part to a whole new level, and that is because of the terrible controls. Because the controls are trying to be TOO realistic, it is hard maneuver around, which can end up making you spin and turn countless of times to get past that wall, making you feel a little uneasy (again, i have a high tolerance level for motion sickness).I can recommend this game, but only for those with a strong stomach/high motion sickness tolerance, and those that want to waste time on figuring out the controls."

I  held off from buying Detached for ages until I read one review that essentially said treat it as a space simulation and play with that in mind. I did and I've had a great time in the game. Not once had nausea. I've rocked on my feet with the changes to motion and perspective but not once felt I'll.I'm not going to go over all the usual pros and cons but I'll just go over a few of the small parts from the experience that makes it so immersive.My top effect is the helmet. So simple but hard to pull off. The helmet feels exactly as you would expect, roomy yet enclosed, excellent sound muting. However for me the most immersive part is you cannot put your head ""through"" the helmet. If you try the helmet just moves with. So simple but excellent.The controls are very well done. It's very easy to spin out of control but also to regain control. It ďoes feel as it might in space.Get the experience and find out what it really might feel like in space."

,Recommended,436230,29772144,Posted: 7 February,all,Dazirius,"Well, that was stunning.The single player map (all I've played thus far) of Detached by Anshar Studios is absolutely gorgeous to look at.The single player map plays out like a metroid-ish game in that progression is determined by the acquisition of new gear to overcome obstacles. You start off in what looks like a hangar on a space-craft.*MINOR SPOILER ALERT*I don't recall whether that first room had windows looking out into space or not, but I suspect it didn't.If I'm right and it didn't, that was a great design choice because two or three doors in, you feel like you're heading deeper into the ship/installation, when all of a sudden you float through the last door and find yourself in open space. It's a very odd feeling which I enjoyed immensely. It's a mixture of ""holy♥♥♥♥♥♥that's cool!"" and ""holy♥♥♥♥♥♥I'm floating away from safety!"", and it pushes the tension up a notch immediately. That was a very clever move indeed.*SPOILER ENDS*The only speech in the game is your suit computer keeping you appraised of your current situation. As you perform tasks, gently guided by curiosity more than signposting, the suit computer announces the state of the part of what now looks like a disjointed space station as you enter and exit. She also mentions things like ""suit damaged"" if you manage to clumsily slam yourself into something (which happens quite frequently). More alarming however is the calmly spoken phrase ""oxygen low"", which left me nervously checking the oxygen readout on the helmet visor as I darted around looking for a green oxygen canister.I've mentioned it before but it bears repeating, this game is very pretty. The asteroids look great, the man-made installation segments look neat and shiny, the lighting is spot on with glare from the local star when you turn to face it. It's just a joy to look at.The controls are basically the same as for ADR1FT (right stick to rotate, left stick for thrust, triggers for vertical thrust and bumpers for roll) and the space-suit handles *really* well.There's an option to select either an arcade mode of play or a simulation mode. The menu suggests that arcade is an easier choice and simulation is only for those with an ""iron stomach"". Of course I opted for simulation mode ;)I didn't suffer any nausea, but if I'm honest I can see how others might. The primary difference between the modes as I understand it is that in arcade mode rotation is damped, while in simulation it is not. This means that in arcade mode, once you stop applying rotational thrust, shortly thereafter your rotation will cease.In simulation mode, unless you bang into something, releasing the rotation button or stick will stop you rotating any *faster*, but halting the turn requires an opposing thrust. This is why some might find it frustrating (indeed, complaints about the controls abound in the reviews on Steam), or sickness inducing, but I think the developer made the right call by giving the player the option and simply warning that it might cause a reaction.If I'd known the difference between the modes before selecting, I would still have gone for simulation as I'm fairly used to those mechanics from playing Elite: Dangerous, among other games.According to Steam, the single player map took me 77 minutes to complete. The eagle eyed among you will have spotted the price of this title, but hopefully you'll also have noticed that the single player portion of this game isn't what the developer was focused on. There's a multi-player side to Detached that looks very intriguing.I haven't checked it out yet, and there was mention made in the reviews of a potential lack of players, but hopefully I'll get a game in tomorrow night. As far as I can gather, the idea is that two astronauts are stranded in space and for reasons not clear to me yet, only one of them can escape to safety. What plays out is supposed to be a relatively violence-free contest between the two players, each attempting to get to safety while frustrating the progress of the other.It's a neat idea, and with a bit of luck I'll be reasonably good at it (heaven knows I'm bad enough at the rest of the multi-player line up these days).On a technical note, it worked right out of the gate with vRidge/Riftcat and a wired 360 pad on Windows 10. No issues whatsoever. It even provides a very welcome camera reset function which you can invoke with the back button on the pad. Impressive compatibility scores on all fronts.So, as far as the single player is concerned, it's a huge recommendation from me for anyone who fancies floating in (beautifully rendered) space for a while in VR.Whether or not the multiplayer holds together, I'm already glad I own this title.Great stuff!"

I can see why others would say that it makes them sick but man is it an impressive game. The control scheme is different but not impossible to adapt to. I found myself flying around (not expertly) but at least I was able fly around using the rotation and forward movement at the same time.  I have no idea what this game is about so far but I am already intrigued by it.The depth of the immersion on this game is staggering. I really felt like I was there, in that suit. My only beef with this game is the text, it's difficult to read stuff that pops up on your HUD. That is not necessarily the fault of the dev team though :)I will update my review as I get deeper into the game."

,Not Recommended,436230,31851825,Posted: 19 May,all,M. Bison,"This game made me feel super sick!It doesn't let you move your head around at all.  If you accidentally move your head outside of the helmet the game  then the game snaps your point of view back to the center of the suit.  This is the most chunder inducing sensation I've ever experienced.  The astronaught on the cover clearly has a spacesuit that gives him enough maneuverability to turn his head and look over his shoulder so why the heck can't I?  Instead I feel like I'm driving a stretcher with misalighned rockets strapped to the bottom.The movement controls were bad.  The left hand controls your main thrusters and the right hand controls your rotation.  Sounds good on paper, but in game It's very awkward and unreponsive.  I Imagine with enough practice it becomes easy but the game doesn't give you any sort of feedback on how you're rotating.  The difference in movement between tilting down and turning upside down is very slight.The game does something similar to what no mans sky did with it's flight in that it you have to try pretty hard to crash into anything.  The game will magically push you away from any object that it feels you are too close to.  This doesn't help with the motion sickness one bit.The visuals are really good but I couldn't really enjoy them.  I didn't get to experience much of the gameplay but what I experienced didn't leave any lasting impressions.Maybe I'll come back to this game when I have more experience in VR.  But for now this game is not fun for me."

,Not Recommended,436230,32667481,Posted: 22 June,all,Cyrix,"I think I'd be more willing to try and deal with the motion sickness if the helmet was actually attached to my head, but since the helmet is not attached to your head and does not move or rotate with your head, this is more of a sick joke.They aren't kidding about this not being for the easily nauseated."
