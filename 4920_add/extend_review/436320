,Recommended,436320,24394964,"Posted: 18 July, 2016",all,Vsions,"Raw Data is a pretty phenominal experience on the Vive. The production quality is great and the action is intuitive and incredibly fun. I strongly suggest you play it in a room with high ceilings. I lunged up with my Katana to destroy a drone flying over my head, and smashed my ceiling light to pieces raining glass down upon me.. While that was very immersive and felt like the drone actually exploded to pieces on top of me, I wouldnt recommend it for others as it took a long time to clean up and pull the shards of glass out of my shoulders. However yes, I felt likw a total badass for like 5 seconds until what I had done sank in  on me. Awesome game though!!"
,Recommended,436320,24326238,"Posted: 14 July, 2016",all,Rage@oVRactive,"The game has been out for about 9 hours and I spent about 8 hours playing it. Thats after a days work too. While I'm tempted to leave the review there as a ""NUFF SAID"" review, I'll go on to say the following.Its probably the most polished action game for the VIVE currently. The controls are slick, the graphics are sweet and the atmosphere is ceirtainly present in the earlier darker levels. As an early access title I do not regret buying and would reccomend to anyone who... likes guns/swords/sci-fi... likes to burn calories, and likes to soak their vive foam in films of their own sweat regularly...... serious though, if you were thinking about buying a gym membership, just buy this instead, you will have a more interesting engaging experience. My arms ache, my legs ache and I have no regrets. The nature of this game lends itself to moderate exhertion to play well, and if you game for long periods you WILL get fit, (more than likely without realising it) as a byproduct of being involved in this dance of death, ducking and dodging, spinning round to take on multiple enemies.... hell after some stages you realise you've wasted over 100 enemies. But its not just the physical activity that will bring your heartrate up... some of those robots are downright scary on first encounter. The game does a good job on atmosphere.This will undoubtebly be one of my favourite VIVE games for a long time to come. Unlockable skill grind, multiplayer, dual weilding pistols, swords, multiple hero classes... I'm just a little gutted I have to sleep now, instead of continuing to play this game...10/10 would regret sleeping again"

Very replayable as well.Supports VRWorks and thus runs very smoothly on my GTX 1070.  Able to run ""EPIC"" settings.Raw Data is pretty much a tower defence game (a genre I love) in first person.  The combat is fun and furious.  The waves are scary.  I have to play it on the lowest skill level at the moment.  The game is a challenge and I like that."

,Recommended,436320,24320288,"Posted: 14 July, 2016",all,Ash,Unlike many other VR games in Early Access. This game is very polished and features interesting mechanics. Though I just played the tutorials and the first mission as the Cyber Ninja Saija or whatever her name is. It's extremely fun. Throwing my katana and waving it infront of me frantically trying to slash some robots.It is not just a standard wave based shooter. You can teleport around and each character have different abilities to use. My first impression is it is well worth the price point. Will come back to play more and update the review.

I was just like you, I downloaded Gorn, Spell Fighter and more to try to convince myself I could get great experiences like this for a lower price. First off the game is gorgeous, too gorgeous (you'll need a meaty GPU for this one, I currently run a GTX980). Second off it's not just a lazy wave shooter with bright colors, THIS GAME GOT ME BREATHING! I was exhaling on my shots and between my dashes. I say dashes because I think this game does a great job of implementing the ""teleport"" function and didn't break immersion for me too much.What I liked the most was the friendly player base and how easy it is to hop into someone's game or point at a person with a funny name and ask them to join you. I skipped all tutorials after the first because I had friends pointing me (literally) in the right direction the whole time.I'm almost mad that I'm willing to say this, but this game is actually worth the asking price, and I was skeptical at first."

This is the game I've been waiting to play all my life. It reminds me of when I first saw wipeout on the PS1 but much more of a leap.  Just wow!.Can you call it game? It feels more like a futurist warfare survival sim. I've never felt the rush of fear and the adrenaline of dashing around a room, popping up alongside a droid for a head shot then back to cover. Checking over my shoulder if any thing else is coming for me.If you have a Vive this has to be on your list.  But first... drink water. Get your cable tethered high dog lead style, Strip to your shorts and then start.  If you are unfit be prepared for a workout! You'll  be up and down in and out of cover, dodging left and right.  Spinning, aiming. Reloading. Non stop movement.I'm so glad we have such a great game early in the life of this next Gen VR. It means it is here to stay. I can't wait to see what other people look like playing in it.  lol."

But considering the work that went into this game and that it already feels more polished than most VR games, I think the price is kind of justified. I also hope that EA means that they are working on more content and improve the performance. It is truly a very immersive experience and you want so much to explore it further. I hope for more levels to explore and not only survival horde mode. The setting is very interesting and could give so much more to the game.Recommended, even for the price! It is definitely in the Top 10 of the best VR games so far."

,Recommended,436320,30548217,Posted: 16 March,all,Durante,"Raw Data is my favourite action game in VR so far. I've been following it since release, and await each new content update with bated breath.What is so good about it? Well, I'm glad you asked!The reason isn't any single feature, but how it masterfully blends all of its elements:Action-packed, immersive 360° gameplay with great controls.High-end visuals and audio with a high overall production quality (this also applies to the voice acting).Full co-op support, which makes everything better, but VR even betterer.A large amount of content with great replayablility and lots of variety, both in missions and in playable characters.Weapons and a wide variety of skills that feel great to use, and also all have a meaningful impact on gameplay.Perhaps most importantly, a nicely balanced difficulty progression and multi-faceted possibilities for improving your skill.That last point is something that you might also call gameplaydepth, but I wanted to be precise since that term gets thrown around a lot. What I mean by it is that there are many ways to improve how you play the game. You can improve your performance in terms of action gameplay, how well you use your weapons and skills and how quickly you can detect and dispatch enemies. You can improve your strategy: where do you position yourself, when do you use time-limited skills, which enemies do you attack first, who covers which area in coop. Finally, you can also greatly improve your play by increasing your meta-knowledge of the game. Learn the maps, spawn points, the exact behaviour of each enemy type, and mission-specific challenges.And what is truly crucial here is that all improving in any and all of these is extremely rewarding."
,Not Recommended,436320,30132897,Posted: 23 February,all,VetteofSD,"I decided to give this game a shot since it was frequently recommended as one of the best VR games currently. After playing it for some time, I honestly don't understand what everyone thinks was so great about it.The Pros:1: It looks fantastic. Easily one of the best games graphically speaking.2: The game is very polished. Smooth gameplay and menu system.3: A good challenge, definitely easy to get swarmed.The Cons:1: Characters: The trailer for this makes it seem like you have access to a variety of weapons (Pistols, sword, etc.), but really you have access to three characters that have a specific weapon they can use. Was fairly disappointing.2: Enemies: The enemies were immensely boring. Think of it as the iRobot movie, but the enemies walk at a Star Wars battle droid rate. Sometimes a big one shows up. No unique characteristic, just big. Some do actually shoot at you. Somehow they were all just very....blah.3: Weapons Gameplay: The only weapons/character you ever have to use is the Pistol Expert. Using anyone else is fairly pointless. The sword/saber gameplay is terrible. You can stand in one place and gently wave it around like an orchestra composer and do better then if you were actually trying to use it as a sword. Then proceed to stand around waiting until you're surrounded since the enemies only approach in large clumps.4: Controls: The shotguns two hand grip controls are very intermittent. You have to ""grab"" the pump to hold the gun. You also have to ""grab"" the ammo off of your back to reload it.  There are two different controller schemes. One to click and hold the grip button to grab something, the other to toggle on/off. So you have the choice of potentially dropping your magazine while reloading, or being glued to your shotgun. The game can get very hectic and this setup causes nightmare when you're trying to be quick.Despite the cons, it is an excellent looking, well polished game that was definitely well developed. However, after giving it a fairly long chance (~5hrs) it got very boring very fast. It also never actually got engaging. In the first ten minutes I reached my conclusion as to how lame the enemies were. I had heard so many good things about this, and yet I was honestly forcing myself to play it after the first two hours. For $40, it was an overhyped letdown."

76561198016989216,Recommended,436320,24328168,"Posted: 14 July, 2016",all,Nutzo  -=[X]=-,"Raw Data is the most polished VR experience yet for our wonderful HTC Vives.  I'm sure plenty of reviewers will mention how the graphics are truly great, the menu system is the best yet, the sense of depth and repeat gameplay is clearly top-of-the-line, even in Alpha v0.1.  This review could be short and sweet...  AAA+ must have title.If you own a Vive, this will be your flagship game.  I own every great, good, sorta good, and barely good game for the Vive so far (my library is 70 deep already), but it is obvious after my first hour that Raw Data will be playable for days/months/years to come.  I have blasted drones daily in SPT.. I have killed many a Hover Junky, and I will slice my way through every skeleton/zombie horde I can find (or just block laser bolts with a lightsaber).  Raw Data combines all of these experiences with the highest graphic quality available.The reason I chose to write this review was to help a few of you out there get the most out of your graphical experience for Raw Data.  These tips will be old news by next week, but right now your eyes will thank me.I rock the Nvidia 980ti (the Strixx OC version), and a solid state HD <-- crucial.I turned my graphics settings for Raw Data to Epic with 2.0x in-game supersampling.   I definitely suggest you max your in-game sampling past 1.0 regardless of GPU, as every step up will not only help clarify the text, but the neon lights (and other details) all around will become much less pixelated.  The 980ti will handle Raw Data at 2.0 in-game ssaa.. and the results are noticed instantly.I then brought a few of the options (like AA, shadows and distance) down to High for a small but noticed bump in framerates.  I had previously added a line of code in my steamVR.VRsettings file (found in config folder in steam directory), to enhance my supersampling to render pre-game at 1.2x the resolution.. and other than a bit of blur in my quick hand movements in Raw Data, that setting seems to be adding some bonus clarity in the graphics of the arenas and especially in text/menus.  FYI, lots of people think you need to bump your supersampling to 1.5, but I personally notice almost no difference from 1.2-1.5 (except for GPU heat).  If you have a monster setup, then I would absolutely suggest bumping your ssaa to 2.0, because that makes a huge improvement... but a single 980ti won't keep you at 90 fps.  If this is the first time you have heard of editing your own steamvr.vrsettings file, I suggest you google ""vive supersampling"", because with minimal effort you can greatly improve your graphics for nearly every game.oh, and the MOST important part of the graphic enhancements from this review... Nvidia released a new driver for us on the same day Raw data dropped, and it has Raw Data optimization that can increase your framerates by up to 30%.. so go download that gem before your start freaking and tweaking.Raw Data   10/10,  Great job Devs, and thanks for posting that roadmap for Alpha v0.1-v1.0.  Every addition you guys are planning looks awesome, and we can't wait for more!"

That being said, I feel absolutely compelled to write a review for this game. Where to start? Let's just start with the words: ""Awesomely Addictive!"" Never before has there been such a smooth and ""polished"" VR combat experience that allows the player to wield a sword or duel wield pistols while wrecking havoc! This game is worth every penny and I'd recommend it to everyone with a VIVE.Don't work out? Too ""lazy"" or ""busy"" too? Play as Saija, the cybernetic ninja chick and work up a sweat! I can gladly confess that most of my days of exercising is over due to this game. If you put a lot of effort and time into this game it can pay off. Just keep a hand towel and a bottle of water nearby and out of swinging distance! It has built in voice comms so you can speak to whoever you meet in co-op. assuming they speak a language you understand, lol.I must admit that the game can be a bit challenging for some and some reviews reflect that. But if you are an avid FPS, gun enthuiest, or martial artist, lik myself, you will get a blast out of this game! Combining kendo, some ninjutsu, and even some tai chi while playing as Saija is a beautiful thing to do (and watch I'm told). But you don't have to know how properly wield a sword or a firearm to have a great time in this game. The community is friendly and helpful and the dev's are active on the forums and take our feedback seriously. Several major updates and changes have occured due to direct requests or complaints by us. This game is the best ""bang for your buck,"" when it comes to VR combat.The trailer and screenshots don't come close to doing it justice. You just have to play it to believe it. For me, it's common to co-op with a ""first timer"" and hear their shouts and laughter of delight no matter what language they speak, as well as their bloody murder screams when they are killed or ambushed! That in itself is at least worth ten dollars! Beating the levels can really give you a sense of acomplishment, plus if you are having trouble, just switch to MP and host a match or search for an existing one. Every player I've played with has pretty much been a good sport and a fellow gaming nerd.BUY THIS GAME!!!"

If so... this is your game. I've had the vive for a few months now and so far this has been my best experience in VR. Seriously... if you own a Vive then get this game. It's a bit physically demanding but as a larger guy I totally forget about it and just play.Any negative reviews I've seen so far say that AMD cards seem to be lagging a bit. That's a shame but the game is in early access. I expect them to optimize the game over the next few months but If you own a lower grade AMD card you may want to hold off for a bit. There are several graphics options which most VR games I've played do not even have. On the default settings it felt totally playable with a 980ti and i7 5820k.

Despite the fact this is a post-summer sale week, there's a reason why - This game is brilliant.It's early access but for what content there is there's plenty of polish, despite the occasional bug (that being said, the most notable was the fully automatic pistol that seemed to ignore the limited time the ability otherwise would be. Very handy >:3 )That being said, there are two fundamental issues to be plastered out if you're a single player person.1 - If you're playing the Ninja, you'd better know how to throw that sword good - There's flying foes and ones that'll wreck you if they get close.2 - The later stages are simply insane to do solo - Even after I found out how to place turrents (main hand menu button, seeing as the tutorial for this doesn't exist?) the amount of bots it can hurl at you is simply obscene - That being said, co-op I had was an utter blast - covering each other and what not.And now for the nit-picks!- You developers are utter sadists for the crawlers being introduced in the dark stage. You scared me and my pal when those buggers lept at us.- Volumes sliders for peoples mics please! Absurdly loud isn't very good as a 'be all end all' setting.- More stages that aren't just varients - What you have here is really two stages thus far - Though plenty more promised along the way. One of the maps has a bright and a dark varient, whilst the other ups the amount of cover and adds a third lane for bots to stroll down to make you panic -  Truth be told, I'd be delighted if you planned to contiously support this with more levels even after post launch - I reckon I'd even pay £5-£7.50 for extra map packs.- Make the punch more effective  - I feel it's useless as is seeing as even in the tutorial it's a bit...useless.- Whilst I'm aware Katana's are pretty bad for thrusts, it'd be nice to be able to stab a bot.TLDR - This is fantastic, if slightly lacking in content for now. It's well polished and great with someone else - Though good luck finding a RL friend with a desire to play with you and a HTC Vive. Moar content Moooaaaar."

It got great action on par with Space Pirate Trainer but with more variety, character progression and gameplay depth and just the right amount of movement.

,Recommended,436320,24366376,"Posted: 16 July, 2016",all,Molesting Mist,"I was completely not interested in this game through all the hype over the past month or two. Just another wave shooter, yawn.Then, after seeing the rave reviews, a friend and I bought copies to play together. Instantly realised this isn't just another half-baked wave shooter like the rest.To me, what makes this feel less like a tech demo and more like a game:- Classes with very different different playstyles that can compliment each other in coop.- You earn points every level you play, which provides points for you to unlock different upgrades across your classes.- These are permanent unlocks so your character can change quite a lot as you progress- The menus are stunningly good, and feels like a full game. A lot of VR menus have been extremely lackluster so far.- I'm only on level 3, but already all three levels have really changed the game dramatically. I'm interested to see where it goes, but Level 3 starts allowing you to place auto-turret emplacements, and the game starts to become a bit of a tower defense. This game has made me realise how great Sanctum would be if it were in VR.- There's a real sense of fear that I get when robots are on me/in my face. I think that this has an advantage over other games in that I don't expect robots to have facial expressions, so it keeps the immersion high when things get up close and personal.- Dash/teleport mechanic is really solid, and allows you to not just feel like you're standing around waiting for the enemies to come to you. Also has some interesting gameplay mechanics (if something grapples you, you cannot teleport).Downsides currently - there's a ton of bugs. Unable to reload, losing voice in game, sound levels playing up, game crashing (including crashing SteamVR and Steam). No way to mute the in game mic, and its permanent open mic. I'd rather just have the ability to mute it so that my friend and I can just use our Discord instead.Depending on how fresh they keep things as the levels move on will make a world of difference. Loving the game so far, definitely bring a friend. Cant imagine I'd stay as interested in singleplayer."

The first mission got pretty frantic quickly and whilst I am still getting used to the aiming I had a lot of fun dodging and ducking to avoid getting killed.Mostly what I am enjoying is the fact that this appears (although half the missions don't exist yet) to be a well produced piece of content.  There are different characters you can be, with different special abilities and unlocks.  Voice acting seems pretty solid although the context/story is a little light, at least there is some sort of attempt at that,  The initial gun feels ok, I would prefer some haptic feedback and a more oomph like sound though perhaps.Overall the whole game just has a 'proper game' feel that so much in VR lacks right now.  The multiplayer is bags of fun and the promise of more to come makes this without a doubt the best VR title so far."

It's also quite a great looking game if your computer can handle some super-sampling (built-in game option).I especially enjoy the teleportation mechanic of this title, where your character wraps quickly from point to point (similar to Doom VR), instead of instant teleportation. Rather than breaking your immersion, you feel like a Space Ninja blinking around cutting down foes. As a VR gamer who generally despise teleportation mechanics, this game has truly done it right."

When I was having the tracking issues I filled out their bug submission form and received a response the same day. That prompt turn around continued with each successive communication. To me, that's a huge reason to support these guys.The 0.3 release didn't just bring bug fixes but also new content. You can definitely see growth in the level design as the new level feels more like a Dungeon Defenders map than the very basic maps we've had before.

I have played the game for 10 hours now and have not finished the single player campaign yet and it isnt even half way done. So after release you probably looking at 20 hours playtime and then there is multiplayer... so something about 2 dollars per hour playtime, which is outstanding for a VR game.It is more than just an arcade game, it has a story that is acutally quite solid. Obviously the missions are not really affected by the story too much, but it is nice how it is presented (both speakers are original and do a good job at narrating what you are doing).It is also more than just a wave shooter. The first two levels and all of the videos showing them unfortunately give a wrong imrpession of the gameplay. You are not always in a small room with limited space to manoveur, just shooting robots creeping towards you. Half of the missions are actually so large that you have to constantly move between several strategic positions in order to defend the critical locations. You can and indeed must place turrets and shield generators to further reinforce and defend certain attack lanes. Of course in multiplayer this is even more exciting because you have to coordinate which player holds which positions and sometimes need to should for help. Furthermore some levels have some additional mechanics like dodging laser beams Resident evil (the first movie) style or preventing robots to reach a reactor where they charge up and become a gigantic super robot. I could continue listing other cool stuff but I dont want to spoil you too much.Most of the reviewers complaining about gameplay have not even played for an hour, so they have missed out all of the later more exciting missions.The graphic is great, even though the resolution is quite low in order to maintane acceptable frame rates. But there are a lot of options to adjust the graphical appearance including a resolution multiplier.The devs constantly releasing content and performance updates. Since the start of the Early Access they added one additional character, about doubled the number of missions and added a ton of other features. They also listen to the community and release hotfixes if something causes major problems.CONS:There are some bugs and in some particular situations performance is still not great. But then Im just having a R9 390 + fx8350, so if you are using a more decent system it should work fine. And I am confident that the developer will sort out all of the issues until release.CONCLUSION:Yes, there are some games out there that are better in certain aspects than Raw Data, but not a single one of them is so good overall while lasting longer than a few hours.So I really recommend it and I also recommend unlocking all of the special abilities, they will change your entire playstyle and thus increasing replayability tremendously."

IT WORKS GREAT!Besides that the gameply feels very fresh giving increased difficulty with several surprises and creating a way to play that is unique on the both characters that are available today ( 18/07/206.....the game will have more). And you could unlock special abilities for each character also...think of those like special powers to use in specific situations.Regarding the levels... right now they are 4...but let me tell you that those could be long to play..specially if you are new to the game.Regarding the performance on this early access I´m using a 980ti + I7 4790 + 8GB + Windows 10 and I can play PERFECTLY with the Target Render in game set in 1.2 if I want to record the gameplay or 1.4 if I disable my recording software.

I am so close to beating level 2, but haven't yet.  And everyone tells me level 3+ are IMPOSSIBLE without multiplayer.

I kinda doubt we'll ever see side-by-side HTC Vive play (too many cables to get tangled not to mention how would you run it? two different computers? Both running from the same computer?) but I guess there's an online multiplayer in the works (I didn't get to test it out so I don't know if it works or not).When you're playing a game and an enemy is slowly advancing on you, you might sweat a bit... you might even feel nervous, but ultimately you know you're at a computer playing the game and nothing on screen can hurt you.  Well, in VR, your brain doesn't want to believe that.  You see an android walking slowly toward you and you think ""no sweat"" and aim your pistol and fire... what if he doesn't go down in one shot though?  You missed the head, now he's closer... well you panic a bit more.  You get even more anxious.  Add to this the fact that you're being attacked from all sides... left, right, front back and overhead (thankfully nothing coming from below yet)... all that adds to the fear.I guess it's fear on the same scale as a Halloween house of horrors.  You know for sure that nothing in there is going to hurt you.  That still doesn't stop you from jumping back, recoiling as the monster jumps out of the closet at you.  I guess if you have the presence of mind to be able to analyze everything before you act/react you wouldn't, but reflexes work on their own.So yeah, this one triggered my reflexes several times...and it's usually those ♥♥♥♥ing ninja robots that do it too.  Occasionally I get caught by a stray bullet I didn't see, or a missile I couldn't shoot out of the air, but those just elicit the ""oh brother"" response from me.  The Ninja appearing 6"" behind me with a giant sword?  That almost makes me jump out of my skin. So yeah, if I had a partner and we could fight back to back so that I could scan 180° in front of me and let him worry about the 180° behind me, that would be great.I mostly stuck with the gun.  I know I have a sword I can draw out, but for me, seeing the gun in my hand made me feel safer, except when the ammo count was a big red 0.  Also, this is one of the few games to make you pull the clip out and load it.  Usually there's an automatic reload when you press a button, but not here.So let's talk about enemies:  There's the basic android which is unarmed but can apparently smash his head through bulletproof glass, so kinda like your basic zombie which is kinda scary.  Then there's the assault android which comes out with a rifle and takes cover appropriately.  He's actually hard to kill but not very scary.  There's the ninja who makes very little noise, does all kinds of jumping dodge rolls and moves pretty fast....He's frightening.  There's a drone which shoots at you, and they're not very scary at all.  They're the mosquitos of the game.  And then finally (from what I've seen) there's a heavy android that fires missiles that shoot up and then arc back down toward you (presumably to give you a chance to shoot it out of the air).  They're hard to kill, but they're only frightening when you're busy with something else.Some waves leave you with no cover at all while other waves will give you a partial ""desk"" type thing to hide behind.  I didn't find the cover particularly useful though considering that it was only on one or two sides and you're being attacked from all sides usually.This game is still being worked on so there's lots that's incomplete though most everything I saw looked highly polished to me.  Apparently there's only two ""heroes"" to choose from at the moment but I think there's two more in development.  The two heroes you get are a gun wielding ""Bishop of Gun Fu"" and a sword slicing something or other... I forgot what the other class was called. :(  I think that both classes get access to both the gun and the sword, but I think the special abilities are dependent on the class you chose.Oh yeah, specials! You can (at least in the tutorial) swipe left on the touchpad for full auto mode in case you need to empty your clip ASAP, and you can hold down the trigger to charge up a power shot that will plow through several enemies (if they're lined up).  I didn't see any specials for the sword but there's possibly some for the other class (that I didn't try).Things I liked:The side grips are made to act as your ""holding"" button, so you had to hold the side grip down to keep holding the gun.  Let it go and you drop your gun (which promptly spawns back into your holster so don't worry).You can dual wield two pistolsYou can also use the sword two handed if you like, though I'm not sure if there's any benefit to doing so other than aesthetics.The graphics are great and the game looks highly polished.The gun sights work exactly as you would expect and you're probably better off using themThings I didn't like:After a while, holding that button down kinda fatigued my finger.  I don't want to say ""I got tired of holding a button"" but that's basically what I'm saying.  Maybe in the future Valve can make the grip buttons touch sensitive and you can just touch the grip to show you're holding something.Those damn ninjas almost gave me a heart attack.I really don't like being attacked from behind.  It adds to the tension but maybe they could start you out with enemies coming at you only from in front and bring in the surrounding attacks for later levels.It didn't seem to make very good use of the Vive's Room scale.  I played the majority of the time standing still.  Maybe they could make a separate set of levels for small room scale and larger room scales.Overall though this game is fantastic and is one of those games most likely to appear on youtube with some crappy let's player screaming like a girl as he gets sliced into bits by ninja robots.  Unfortunately you don't get to pick who gets sliced to bits."

One of the levels creeped me out so bad I had to rest a day before I tackled it again.  Best tip for newbies is to pay close attention to the unlocked tech.  You can only solo so far with just pinpoint accuracy and timing.  Multiplayer online works well given how complex this game is compared to other much simpler similar VR games that only offer solo.I have played this with a GTX 1070 with Windows 7 and 10.  Windows 10 plays smoother for me.  No supersampling and no camera to maximize performance.

Since it's still early access I will give a few things I'd like to see improved upon ("" but you said 10/10..."", yeah yeah ik that's compared to everything else that exists, even the best things can get better). Firstly is the swordfighting, I think there should be more interactivity when facing the invisible robots with swords, you should be able to deflect his sword with your sword and vice versa, the probability of his accuracy at deflecting yours increasing based on difficulty. Secondly (perhaps this is just because I am bad at the game) there should be a more exact method on how to hit the flying drones when deflecting their shots with the sword, (if it's based on angle of blade and I am just bad then ignore this). Anyway, overall, very good game, very fun, very immersive, I reccomend it to anyone."

It's definitely going to be a lot better than most of the wave shooters for vive once it gets further along. I like that you're not just waiting for enemies to come to you. This is one of the only games where teleport really works with the game and feels natural. I also love deflecting the lasers with my sword.That said, I'm probably going to wait a couple months before returning to this game. At 31.99, its difficult to justify the price. I couldn't even do the tutorial because the menus were so bugged out. So I spent about a half hour just trying to figure out how to pull out the sword. BTW, you put your dominate hand on your back lke there is a sheathe on your back then pull out the sword with the grip button. I also had some issues when adjusting the graphics. I reccomend everything on medium if you have a 970. I had to restart the game after changing the graphics because things started getting really buggy once I did and I almost got sick. However, when I restarted it was much better.The hit animations of the enemies need quite a bit of work.  It seemed like the way I was hitting them with my sword didn't matter and they would animate in the same awkward way regardless.I'd say that this game, in its current state, is worth about $20.00. Of course, when this game finally does become $20, it may be worth a lot more than that because of new content and features. Because of its potential, though, I'm recommending it.

Initial thoughts are really promising.This is not like the majority of EA games from the look of it, the graphics are a huge step up and more so the animations and mechanics feel like a fair size studio.  There are different options ranging from low to ultra, I'm running a 980TI/i5 and I could run ultra, but I was limted to the other option which scales the pixels up and down and even though it was jerky when i ramped them up, the graphics potential was stunning.  Devs can do top graphics now on the Vive as this shows, it's just the graphic cards which will hold them back.  I can imagine a 970 would be borderline on this game, but refund if it doesn't work.Gameplay wise, so far it's the usual affair of being attacked and attacking robots, drones etc but it is intense.  You have a pistol which feels really nice with great loading mechanics, a blade which works as a blade would and also the ability to punch.  I have literally panicked and punched a robot to kill and put my hand through my lampshade in the real world :(You also have the need to duck and move quickly, so clear the room rather than be a prat like me a demolish it in a panic. If like me you have dropped the chaperone system, put them back up for this game as you lose track where you are in game as things happen quickly.Movement wise they use the blinking method, however it rather than just appear it at where you point, you actually zoom in really quickly and this is a nice touch and suits the game style.Soundwise, so far first class.  Soundtrack, guns loading, drones, robots and the in game voice all adds to make the game a slick title.I'm only on level one, but it's looking and feels very promising for an EA game. In the menu it shows MP, so the hour duration people are saying is not correct.This would be the go to game now for my mates to try and show VR to them.I'll keep updating as the game updates and I play through it.Cheers devs, nice job so far."

Don't let you fool by the wave shooter label. Yes, ist is some kind of wave shooter, but not the one, that let's you just stand in one position and shoot enemy waves. In fact, this game has more to do with the horde mode you get in a game like Gears Of War. So you have a level to jump arround (smooth locomotion is not supported) and fight waves of enemies. The game practicaly never keeps you trapped in just one position.The better you play, the more credits you earn. With this credits you can buy weapon tourets or shields and other helpfull stuff to place inside the levels. These things will help you to fight the enemy waves. Talking about the enemies: The developers mix this up on this front and you have to fight all kinds of robots and flying drones - some just run at you, some shoot guns, some have a rocket launcher, some are as tall as a house.The game is still in early access but allready offers a lot of content. You can play as one of three characters with different weapons and abilities. Every character can learn new skills throughout the game, so you can level up and become stronger. Probably the best thing is, that you can play every mission in coop with one other player, so you can combine the abilities of different characters. There are always players online and many of them are ready to join you in a coop mission.Unlike many other VR games you get a lot of playtime out of this. There are quite a few levels and some of them take a good amount of time to complete. The replayability is high too and since it is still early access, there might be even more to come.Graphics are good, so is most of the level design. The game runs very well on my Radeon R9 390 so players with a stronger GPU might probably get even better visuals.So if you are new to VR and ask yourself, if this game is worth the money: Yes, abolutely! Just give it a try, no matter if you own an Oculus Rift or an HTC Vive. This is one of the games, that make it worth to own one of these expensive headsets."

I own three highly rated titles Arizona Sunshine, Raw Data, and Bullet Sorrow. In terms of VR immersion and amount of content I'd rate them in the respectful order as I listed them. I personally will pick Arizona Sunshine 10 times out of 10 times instead of this game.HOWEVER... If you have little ones, or a girlfriend who is not into bloody head popping zombies 0_0... Then Raw Data is the game you want. It is PG enough where the fainted heart can handle yet enough violence to keep savages like you and me entertained ;)... After watching me play the game my girlfriend eagerly wanted to try this game and boy she did... On the other hand she wouldn't try out Arizona Sunshine no matter how I try to bribe her, =3...In terms of game play as of right now you get to try out two combat style in the game. Duo pistol or mighty Ninja sword. Each has cool special abilities which you can utilize. The Ninja sword is super dope as not only you can use to chop enemies apart but also toss the sword out like a boomerang, and catch it as it comes back to you. There seems to be two character slot that is currently locked, which probably will either unlock later or will be sold as dlc...Things you might consider... This game does not have a campaign or story mode. Just different stages you can complete. If you choose to solo it's literally IMPOSSIBLE to get pass stage 4 by yourself. You will need to que up with other players complete the further levels. Here is the contradiction...  Just like Arizona Sunshine the game lags for everybody except for the host. Which is consider to be quite game breaking since the game is pretty much base on multiplayer... And lastly I feel the aiming for the pistols are quite off.

Pretty amazing, if you can get past the many bugs and issues that might drive you nuts.The game is sporting two unique operatives, Discount Gun Fu master Christian Bale (Bishop) and Ninja Jedi (Saija/Robot Bae). With Bishop, with all abilities unlock you recieve two pistols, bullet storm turning them into automatic weapons for a short period, bullet time ability, and you look like a dashing rogue. Saija is equiped with a nice future katana to cut foes down or use it as a boomerang, can use holigraphic shurikens, deflect lazers and rockets, and can use telekinesis (the force essentially).You may also place down turrets to deal or delay the enemy as they come after you wave after wave with about 7-8 types of robot foes to fend off on about four maps with decent variety and scale.The coop multiplayer is where the game truly shines and is somewhat required as this game is very difficult to play by yourself in its current state. When it is actually working, the fun kicks up a notch. Hell i challenged people to quick draw with me before we even start a mission.Graphics are decent and superior to most if not all other vr titles.

Easily the most ambitious Vive game to date (that I've played) .First impressions are stellar. the first thing you'll notice is that this is very pretty and a lot more tweakable than most VR titles (the supersampling is very welcome). It also boasts a very fluid movement/teleportation system, that works great even if you haven't got the space for room-scale, rarely did I feel hindered by my fairly confined play area (then again I mainly used the guns, sword combat did cause a few problems which I'll get to later).The core gameplay: fighting against formidible hordes of robots, is deeply satisfying. The pistol you get (while not as satisfying or deep as the guns in Hotdogs Horseshoes & Handgrenades) is a joy to use, especially when you've got two of them. Within mintues I was zipping around the map firing a flurry of lead feeling like a total badass. For one round I decided to try out the sword 'cause he looks super cool. Unfortunately I did manage to whack my hand of the walls and roof a couple of times but I can't blame the game for that,Previously: ""what I can criticise about the sword combat is that there's not that much feedback when hitting enemies which didn't make it that enjoyable for me personally. Other people seem to like the sword guy though so it's not really a problem in multiplayer (which is THE way to play the game).""Revised: ""after giving the sword guy another shot with all of his added abilities, I am inclined to take back anything negative I said about him. Throwing swords (and shuriken), force abilities and a badass groundpound make him just as fun, if not MORE fun to play than pistol man. I'd definitely stick with pistols when you're starting out, but when you've managed to buy all the upgrades, give the ninja a shot.""The 4 missions I've played nicely ramp up in difficulty and are varied enough to keep things fresh. Over the course of your playtime, you'll quickly figure out which hero is better at tackling a given type of murderous robot, which provides a great sense of teamwork when you're calling robot types to your buddy to murder and provide covering fire.Overall, the whole package is the first VR title I've played which didn't feel like a tech demo/showcase or tool but rather like an actual game. And that is what makes it so special. Is it worth the asking price? Definitely.Just... make sure you bring a towel or two if you're going to be using a sword. You'll need it."

As you play you get points and these points can be used for some pretty cool upgrades that are specific to each character. There is kind of a story but it is a girl talking in the back ground aside from here warning you what type of enemies are coming it is not really all that interesting (maybe there is more to come?). The graphics and sound are good nothing spectacular. The enemies are pretty unique the variation within a level has you constantly changing tactics and moving. With the teleporting you can go all over the maps with at least one map being quite large. Overall the game is polished and is a blast when you are playing coop. Not sure I would enjoy as much alone.

The movement system works extremely well, which is a mixture of room scale walking/dodging with the best implementation of teleportation in a VR game to date.  You really have to use everything at your disposal as well, from gunning, dodging, reloading, teleporting to better locations, switching to melee...it's crazy.  I haven't got to the point where you have to start defending your data matrix thing or setting up turrets, but even just looking at the base gameplay it's the most complete experience to date.I'm actually taking a break because after 4 waves I'm sweating my ♥♥♥ off lol.Anyways I haven't experienced anywhere close to what even the EA has to offer, and looking at the road map and what's to come...seriously...just get the game.

Although the hit boxes may not be perfect and the melee isn't as good as that of, say, Vanishing Realms, the close-range combat is still pretty damn good.  You can tell the Devs thought the fighting through because there are weak spots on the enemies and the different abilites actually require skill to use.  Take the ""Katana Throw"" for example, the initial toss can be pretty clunky, but is beyond useful once you figure out how to aim it on the rebound.  Movement is smooth as well, and I don't feel displaced when using the Vive Teleportation like in other games. Just a smooth dash from Point A to Point B.  I don't know what else really to say about it other than that it was definitely worth every cent, even in its current state without all the other content yet to come.

It's well polished and just so much fun to play. The two classes I've tried so far are very different and equally satisfying to play.Let's just say the only things I don't like about this game, is that the graphics are a little juddery around the edges. It needs better Anti-aliasing or super sampling, and to run slightly smoother in order to keep the good performance the game already has. Sometimes the rocket firing robots simply disappear when they die but its a minor issue to be honest.The other thing is that the really big opponents are a little too bullet-spongey. The ones that fire a big laser beam out of its eye and is like 8 meters tall. It just takes too much firepower to bring it down.To improve this, take the torso robots as an example.They are hard to kill because they are smaller, faster and a hell of a lot scarier than other robots. But they take less firepower to take down. So its hard because they are harder to hit and they scare the absolute **** out of you. It makes it fun.But the big robots are easy to hit but take like 10 mags to kill. Its not fun because its just triggerspamming. It should be more about timing attacks and dodging the robots attacks rather than shooting as much as you can. That would be a lot more fun.Other than that it's well worth the price. I would currently give it 8/10, however if the devs would fix the issues above it would definitely be a 10/10 title."

Due to the latest Hotfixes and Patches, the new addition in content, the rebalancing of older missions and performance improvements I can finally enjoy the game now. Haven't had a single crash in the last days, the new missions are a lot of fun. Thanks a lot for the answer @ developer - that does not happen often nowadays.It feels much more like a finished product now. For the money you invest you'll get a lot in return. Dozens of hours of gameplay, the new leaderboard is extremely motivating. The core gameplay is just as good as ever. You absolutely feel amazing when jumping into the air, stomping down and whirling your katana around you. The difficulty ramps up more steadily, playing this in multiplayer is a lot of fun as well, when you coordinate with your team. I also like that you can replay missions and earn credits which in return activate new abilities. This corresponds well with the difficulty settings and increases the replayability.Definitely the best looking game so far, with polished animations, the atmosphere is still not 100% worked out it seems to me, but no reason to vote it down because of this one annoyance.Cheers!Original (negative) Review:Let me get this straight. This game is good. In its foundation it is solid. The gameplay is fun and I'd love to demo this to people new to VR. It is a lot of fun to play the Ninja, flying in the air and stomping down, throwing the enemies sideways with my powergrip. Awesome!However, first: the balance of the missions is totally messed up. First mission easy, even on hard you fall asleep doing it. The second mission literally destroys you even on easy difficulty. Third mission balanced and fun, fourth mission totally out of control. The layout of the missions, especially 4, is not made for singleplayer. Three entrances with waves coming towards the core and you alone have to watch all three of them over 30 minutes. It feels exhaustive and like work.I am 26 years old and good in shape but even on normal these missions (2 and 4) are close to impossible on any decent level while level 1 and 3 make you fall asleep. This is not balanced! And even if you manage to finally finally get to that sweet sweet last wave, soaked in sweat, boooom, the game simply shuts down. Crash. This happened three times to me now. The game simply shuts down in the last wave.Another point is the quality of the missions. The first one definitely gives you chills due to its atmosphere with the speakers, the japanese roboter. But in the fourth mission there is nothing anymore. You simply pull the trigger and the waves are coming. So the quality varies dramatically.One last point is performance. I have a GTX 1080 totally up-to-date system with an I7 overclocked. I can barely reach 90 fps on medium settings. In fight with lots of robots the framerate drops dramatically, oftentimes causing motion sickness.So no sorry, at the moment I cannot recommend this game... not for this price tag. I rarely do this but after rage quitting for the third time in two days I would rather have spent my money on something else.The Developers seem eager to fix every problem and add content as fast as possible so there is a good chance that I'll set this review to positive in the near future. Right now I would try out other games that are a bit more stable and balanced before spending 37 Euro on it."

This is the sort of game that makes room scale VR.I have the minimum play space available and a low ceiling but it's room enough to be ducking for cover, dodging and shooting all around. Enemies come from all around which adds to the intensity but also means you can get right in to it without going outside your play area.I don't generally like the teleport mechanic much but Raw Data makes it work quite seamlessly. The graphics and performance are great, and it's pretty intense action so you're too busy dealing with enemies to think about being in a VR headset. Turning around and seeing a 7ft robot behind you will get your pulse racing.The gun and reload mechanics are a good balance between realism and gameplay and generally the game feels polished and fun.

,Recommended,436320,24746849,"Posted: 6 August, 2016",all,mako,"I got this game on early release when it first debuted in July 2016. Here's what I can say: yes, it's pretty buggy. You'll experience numerous in game frustrations when your gun inexplicably changes hands, when your sword becomes a gun with no ammo, when you get stuck behind a clipping zone and can't get back to the main area, and of course, when it crashes. Yeah, that all happens, but it should get better.HERE'S WHY YOU NEED THIS GAME: as of writing this and to date, this is the BEST iteration of what VR could be in a virtual multiplayer environment that I've yet experienced. This game is fun on its own, but it comes almost immeasurably more fun when you join a coop/multiplayer level and start kicking the $H*T out of zombie robots with lazer swords and a charging pistol. When you can see someone else's avatar and see the way their arms and upper body actually move and talk to them in real time, it's something totally unlike anything you've ever done before, and for me the experience was pretty earth shattering even though the game crashed before we could complete the level together.Guys, this one isn't 100% yet, but it'll still knock your socks off, it'll wow the hell out of guests, and it's just damn fun even despite all its current glitchyness.

It also makes you feel pressed and alert as you are trying to get those headshots in while you have torso´s jumping in your face in near darkness or fog, dodging lazer shots (or reflecting them with a lightsabre-ish sword!) while trying to bring down the drones that are flying around shooting at you.You will not be 360 no-scoping enemies from across the map, but you will reach a point where you put your two pistols side by side and fire a huge fireball at your enemies, throw your sword like a boomerang through a group of robots and have it return to the palm of your hand and place turrets like it was Natural Selection or Team Fortress.I have two negative points about Raw Data:1) I want more.

You have to dart around the environments, ducking behind cover to avoid lasers and then popping up to shoot flying or crawling robots and then teleporting away.  It is, in a word, exhilirating.The game completely nails the feeling of power - the guns (especially duel-wielding) feel impactful, and the first time you reach behind your back, pull out a sword hilt and then power on an energy blade is an incredible rush.The game runs and looks great on my Core i5 and 1070, with supersampling set to 1.4 and all options on High or Epic, save for antialising.

This game is amazing!  The immersion level is off the hook.  Like many have said watching the trailer really does not do it justice.  It's one of those games that has to be experienced to be understood.  This game is truly a 'must have' for any Vive owners.The pistol gunplay is in particular quite fantastic.  You have to 'grab' the pistol out of your holster on your hip, and to reload you have to 'grab' a fresh magazine from your other hip.  Just like a real pistol you have to line up the dot on the front sight between the dots on the rear site to make an accurate shot.  All that's missing is true recoil from the controller to complete the simulation, but that can be forgiven.  The pistol looks amazingly realistic in your hand.The movement system is also quite nice.  It follows what seems to be the current VR standard of pointing at a spot with your off-hand controller and clicking the track pad to set a destination.  Unlike other titles where to instantly teleport to the location you actually 'glide' quickly there.  I find this preferable to other games as the transition is less jarring since your brain can process how you got from point A to point B.  I am prone to motion sickness and this game's implementation has yet to set my motion sickness off.  It's very slick and effective.If you own a Vive this is the 'killer app' you've been wanting to show all your friends so they can be amazed at what VR is like.  It's amazingly high quality for an early access title.  It's already worth full price in my opinion, but very happy I got in during early access.  I can't wait to see the game as it becomes more fleshed out.In a time of shovelware, half-baked tech demo's, and 'me too' copy cat games, this is one of the few titles that feels AAA caliber and a classic in the making that will set the standard for future games.  You owe it to yourself and the development of the VR ecosystem to pick up this title.  You won't regret it.I HIGHLY recommend this game."

The controls are intuitive -pretty sure subsequent VR FPS handling used this system; manually move,reload your magazine, and hide behind things etc. The maps while few in number are big and the action is fast enough from ground and air, and you can choose melee, pistol, shotgun, all with their own subset of perks.***I would warn that there are cheaper options for this kind of experience on Steam- Bullet Sorrow, Soriento, and the multitude of zombie shooters- the best of which being Arizona Sunshine. If you pick up a vive this season and want something to test your hand with, this is a good example of what VR can offer. It's also a workout, they demand a lot from you even on normal- which I like quite a bit."

The core game mechanics are great.  I love the dash movement system.  I like the ability upgrades.  Gun Cleric seems to me to be the most fleshed out of the two heroes.  The Cyber Ninja was kind of under-balanced compared to him.  Throwing your sword at drones isn't ideal and I haven't gotten the shuriken to unlock yet.  I love the various enemy types.  I love the ""defend the core"" objective concept.  It works well in this game.Hosting multiplayer games is lots of fun.  Joining multiplayer games is laggy in my limited experience, less fun.I think it would be cool if they could implement some dual-hero attacks.  Like Ironman bouncing his attack off of Cap's shield.  I want to shoot bullets at the cyber ninja, have him catch them with telekinisis and send them flying with more power than initially shot.

,Recommended,436320,24336114,"Posted: 15 July, 2016",all,nsf,"It sucks that there is no ""Maybe"" in reviews. Because that's what I would use.I'd like to criticize two points in this game. It's an interesting game never the less to see, but for the most part is a good example of how not to do VR games.1. Antialiasing. Apparently game uses deferred shading renderer UE4 offers, but this thing doesn't work in VR. It just doesn't. You need multisampling and multisampling is very expensive in DS engines. So this game aliases insanely bad. You can try scaling the renderer but it becomes very slow even on 1.6x on my 980gtx. Antialiasing option is useless, because it's a post processing kind of AA. My eyes hurt looking into distance, because all I see is horrible soup of pixels everywhere. Perhaps if you can't change the renderer, maybe getting rid of materials with a lot of shiny details is an option. It's a simple logic here, all you need is just look at AA methods what they do, what they assume. MSAA is the only true AA, it takes multiple samples from geometry and rasterizes them into one pixel. Other kinds of AA mostly do post processing of pixels and assume pixels are small and use known techniques to make them less visible. Second option is super bad for VR because in VR pixels are extremely large. This generation anyway.2. And second problem with this game is 360 degrees action. For some reason most people think it's a natural thing to do. If you can rotate 360 degrees in VR, let's make 360 degrees gameplay. Wrong. Rotating like insane is not what humans do, humans are not good at that. Please don't make games like that.  Best games offer 180 degrees experience. Space Pirate Trainer, Job Simulator, Longbow demo from The Lab. They all focus on play area in front of you and don't force you to spin around at all. It's a taboo in current generation of VR due to cord and in general it's not a very natural thing to do anyway.Other than that game is kind of interesting to play, pew pew and all. Pretty good visuals, but aliasing kills it all. We need more 360 degrees aliasing mess games for people to learn not to do that. Seriously, stop it."

From playing with different people in the campaigns, to trying to solo the story content with all four characters, this game is tons of fun.Pros:Character VarietyEach character feels completely different from eachother, and each has unique elements to it's gameplay.Level DesignWith the exception of the first two levels, each map feels totally different and unique - different places to hide, different enemy spawns, and tey're all pretty gorgeous.GameplayMan... I almost jumped out of my skin the first time I saw a crawler coming at me. I was playing the dual weilding pistol gun-fu master Cleric and reflexively put my guns up and started pulling the triggers until both clips were empty. Sniping enemies with the new Rogue Hunter is tons of fun, blowing things in half with The Boss' shotgun, or slicing robots with Saija's katana... It all feels good. This is a wave shooter, but you have to move around all the levels (and some are quite large) in order to actually defend anything.Cons:Enemy VarietyI don't feel like there are too many different kind of enemies, and some just look to similar to one another (like the walkers/runners and pew pew shooty guys/bzztbzzt laser guys), but this is kind of a minor complaint.MatchmakingThe matchmaking in this game feels rather weak, and several times my mic just wouldn't work with the other person, so we played in silence. Other times I would join to be disconnected. I still haven't been able to play PvP at all, because whenever I try there is ""An Error occured while trying to join the matchmaking lobby""Is this worth the money? Absolutely.

That dynamic of itself is a lot of fun. Despite that, it is not well implemented at the moment.Virtual hands are really well done, and I would imagine will become standard in VR.You're going to need a lot of space to play this game. I have 6x12 section and I keep banging against everything around me when using the sword.The data retrieval mission starts out great and ends up disappointing (I kept hitting walls and furniture going out of safe zone), but its a fair amount of fun. It is completely ruined by particle effects from the big robots missiles at a later stage of the level. I know its early access, but this particular element of the game is frustrating for the sake of frustration.Missiles hit outside the playable zone, and explode in abnoxious particle effect that blocks all vision and damages you. Bot shoots two missiles at the same time so you cannot hit both if you have a chance - if you get one, the other one hits you or the floor and burns you.I haven't really explored past this point, but overall game looks promising.Recommended if you wan't to support the developer, and experience something cool and new.

The robots feel quite well rendered and are quite realistic although the drones could be improved upon.Game feels well made and headshots are very satisfying. Robots are creepy and at times you will get a few scares in some scenarios however as an early access game this game shows much promise.It is definitely a MUST buy for the same price if you like shooters however you will need 360 tracking. 2 oculus cameras are enough if placed correctly in a small area.At times however there are a few bugs and occasional loss of tracking which can be pretty annoying but i am unsure if it is my setup or the actual game.I have not received anything from the dev. This is an honest review

My best recommendation is to avoid the game until this issue is fixed.For me personally, I was experiencing stuttering and severe graphical smearing (text was unreadable) even with my 980GTX Ti. Drivers and firmware are all current, so I cannot tell if this is an optimization issue or my personal eye sight.As of right now, there are four missions available that averages around 2 hours. You are also able to use two classes: the Gun Cleric and the Cyber Ninja. Right now, there is an issue with the pistol producing a flash when fired (related to the above mentioned issue). The Ninja was alright though.Some enemies have a tendency to twist and morph when leaning in to perform an attack. Melee combat in general felt unresponsive. I was directly on many targets and each punch had difficulty registering. The sword on the other hand works wonders, thankfully. It has very little hit feedback, but it does the job.Multiplayer is also a features, but the few lobbies I entered produced some abnormal results. Once I was completely immobile, another I just didn't spawn.I want to wrap this up saying the game has some amazing gameplay to offer, especially with the fact you can teleport around the room. This makes someone like me with very limited mobility potential able to play with very little effort. Enemy variety is diverse enough and the added skills literally make you feel like a badass. Voice acting is splendid and the story, while short at the moment, gives some added depth to the scenarios.That being said, I cannot recommend it right now due to stuttering, overall graphic fidelity and relatively short campaign. I will review this game again down the line, hoping to change this verdict. The combat is solid, but without the frame work it is borderline unplayable.This has been a EAW PSA."

And really if you are okay paying 15 dollars for a small game you might play for 1-3 hours then you shouldn't scoff at the price of 40 dollars (32 right now) for something that is clearly the first shooter that you can play tens of hours of (maybe other than SPT). Game development is expensive and the Vive user base is still fairly small. If we want well made and polished games we need to vote with our wallets and support the devs that clearly plan on making a complete game with AAA level polish. As far as the moment to moment gamplay this game is intense as f**k. The crawler enemies are creepy and intense, and being attacked by many at a time in the dark mission is really stressfull and scary. The voive acting of the little terminal named Simon that follows you into every mission is also on point and the humor reminds me of a valve game, think Wheatley from Portal. 10/10 as far as Vive games go :DPS: Also a quick note on performance. some people are saying they are having trouble maxing the game out on a 1080, that seems weird to me. Im running a 970 albeit with a hefty overclock making it more of a 980 but I have everything but shadows at epic and supersampling from the ingame setting at 1.2 with AA of because it looks horrible and smudgy.

Immersion factor in the game is amazing my whole family loved it including my wife who is not a gamer at all. The game does have some flaws at the moment but given its early access state that is to be expected. With a 390x gpu I have to run the game on a mix of medium and high settings (mostly medium) and I can't turn up supersampling much without taking a hit to frame rates.

With more classes and stuff I could see myself playing it quite a bit.If you are hurting for cash, honestly I would get 5 or 6 other cheap games before I got this one. It's better than your average 5 dollar VR title, but it's not like, 3 to 6 times better.Balance seems funky too. When I played the gun guy I wrecked everything. When I played the sword guy the rocket launcher guy just always dunked me. I get that I can sometimes swing my sword through his missiles and they won't kill me, or even better I can throw my sword through him when he launches them to pretty much one shot him, but the risk to reward there is terrible. If you miss the sword throw you're dead because it won't return in time to deflect the missiles in the air.I dunno, I'm looking forward to co-oping with my friends and this game has a tremendous amount of promise with the multi-class system, and it's downright gorgeous and has more polish than any other title out right now.It's good, but if you're even remotely on the fence about spending $30+ I'd hold out.

Graphics are ok (meh models but to my eye good textures,  lighting is pretty good) with everything at epic except shadows at medium. Framerate was solid except when loading tutorials where I got complete freezes for 1 sec.Menues and general control doesn't seem to well polished. For example the postion of the hands seems of and when you hold a shotgun it gets even worse. Grabbing the front to make the pump action is more frustrating than forgiving.oculus users manually have to enable roomscale. Even though steam detects 3 cams it doesn't cary over automatically.turning right with a and left with x is a pretty nice addition although weird at first. I would have prefered an implemetation liek in robo recall that makes use of the analog stick you use for teleporting for more than just another lame button.About the pistols: Why do manufacturers go for a position where the top plate of the rouch controller is level with the horizon to get the gun level with the horizon? the touch controller grip is way more angled than a guns grip and it feels ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to alway have to angle you wrists o far towards the ground to get it to acctually shoot parallel to you eyes direction. This is just makes it weird and uncomfortable because it wrist overstretches and your hand doesn't feel the same position as it looks in game which is subconciously of-putting and I HATE IT.I only tried single player so far (until phase 4 of the only mission playable as a new player). I had one texture bug after hitting the wall in the newly opened area when the large robot comes in for the first time (the one shooting rockets in the air) where the wall was sprincled witrh red pixel in a rectangle (not blood-like, like a texture bug!). I liked the sword throwing mechanic though it is impossible for me to accurately hit stuff with it(might be due to the same prboelm that causes the controller pos being of - I will try reseting my camera setup before the next round). The deflecting mechanic was an enjoyable alternative for a melee class to deal with ranged/flying targets. I am not yet sure if pointing your sword in any particular directions makes any difference to the direction you will deflect to though.Coop and eventually pvp(saw a beta teasered ingame) might be fun but I haven't tried it yet.So far I do not feel like it is a bad product but that there are som excution errors with the good concepts at hand that could easily be fixed. In short I am not convinced yet that I spent my money wisely.I will update this as I go and add if I returned it or deciced to keep it.Whoever finds any typos can keep them.EDIT: The 2 week period is now over and I never came back to playing it again.

The handheld controller designs are really janky with Oculus, and I'd imagine not much better with Vive. It's hard to do what you want to do, often times I would endeavour something and struggle to press the buttons on my controller to make it happen - not exactly the kind of immersive design you desire most in VR.The character renders in multiplayer are blocky and not indicative of a game made in 2017, although the other players move in a very fluid and convincing manner - hand animations and heads of other players are mapped really well, more than enough to forget the other players have headsets on.The game's universe looks and feels really great - the oppressive ""Blade Runner"" concepts are really neat, but up close everything looks a little flat.There's some very interesting concepts at play here, the telekinesis and melee play in multiplayer is an awesomely creative endeavour - unfortunately Raw Data struggles to be humble,"

The graphics look nice, the movements all feel nice, and I legit felt tense while playing.  Unfortunately, this was THE ONLY game I've played in over 26 years (including all of my Vive games) that has actually given me motion sickness.  After a half hour or so, I started feeling a little disoriented and dizzy, within a minute or so of removing my Vive, I immediately started feeling very barfy.  Maybe it's due to teleporting around while also wildly spinning around to figure out my surroundings and fight, I don't know.  So unfortunately I can't offer any full opinions outside of the small bit that I was able to play.The gun felt solid other than having to deal with the reload animation.  This unfortunately means that no matter how skilled you are, you'll still only be able to shoot as fast as the game will let you.  The swordplay was really awesome as well, but felt like it needed some more reworking.  I didn't get much more than 2 waves with the sword, so I'm sure there's a lot of mechanics I missed.  However, from the short bit I played, it seemed very difficult to kill the drones since I could only hit them if I got lucky with a reflect or they flew down low.  I also kept running into an issue where two-handing it resulted in bringing up the in-game menu and constantly get in the way.  This was obviously an issue with how I was holding my controllers, but perhaps disabling the menu button on the lower-hand remote while doing this would be a good idea?Anyway, all-in-all, I simply can't recommend this game as, despite how cool it is, I can't justify the price for a wave-shooter.

The first level is the best by far, I can play that over and over again; it's fun. The rest of the levels get pretty ridiculous pretty fast. To the point where you have to shoot these robots in the head 5-6 times to kill one, it's freakin tedious.

It feels like they wanted to combine tower defense and a wave shooter but they took the worst parts of each genre and mashed them together.Requires 360 degree awareness because poor level design (generally a circular room). VR headsets do not provide the same field of view humans have. It cuts off the peripheral vision which makes full 360 awareness awkward in a headset. Most VR designers control the action so it feels more natural but that isn't the case here.Outdated teleport system makes locomotion a must.Every weapon feels bad. Pistols are weak and unsatisfying. Sword is more like a throwing weapon than a melee weapon. Shotgun... well 2 handed guns are bad in a lot of VR but this was one of the worst. Bow... just load up The Lab and save your self 40 bucks.  Dropping your weapon leaves you unarmed untill it teleports back.  Reload mechanics for pistol were fun though.Enemys are bland and uninteresting.On the plus side this game does have a great center line/front facing indicator.

,Not Recommended,436320,29728099,Posted: 5 February,all,Blaaguuu,"I'm a bit torn here. There seems to be a lot of potential here, but it was wasted on me, because of a few glaring issues that I ran into early on.First, I feel like there was an incredible disconnect between the framing of the Tutorials and the actual gameplay. The tutorials happen in an incredibly safe environment, and give you a very basic understanding of how to fight, and dont really give you any understanding of how the enemies are going to approach you. For example, one robot will stand stationary in a room, and you take a few shots at it. Then, the very first level totally throws you in at the deep end. Robots start spawning all around me, faster that I can take them out, and moving towards me like a hoard of zombies - I was not expecting this game to give me the same kind of anxiety as The Brookhaven Experiment, and I quickly felt overwhelmed. I was not prepared, and it was a really negative experience.Next, there were a few mechanics that were just plain uncomfortable, and I felt were really bad implementations in VR.I spent a bit of time in the tutorial area, where all movement was teleportation based, and felt good. Then when selecting a level, the 'loading' transition was an elevator that moved down suddenly - with no warning, it almost made me fall down.FInally, it may seem like a small quirk, but probably my biggest problem with the game was an action that one enemy did... There's a type of 'ninja' robot that cloaks, and dashes around to avoid your fire. Several times it dashed up fairly close to me, attacked, then ran away - but at one point it walked up close to me, attacked, and as I was returning fire it dashed THROUGH me, to the other side - Maybe this wont bother everyone, and may seem inconsiquential - but with the level of immersion in VR games, this just mentally hit me like a ton of bricks, and my brain didn't know how to deal with this stimulus - This one tiny action made me feel confused, disoriented, frustrated, and angry.I think there is a good game here somewhere, but buried under a poorly thought out VR experience. I can't recommend it to anyone who experiences any level of discomfort in VR - I was able to handle more time in Windlands and Brookhaven than Raw Data."

Initiually I fired up the game with some friends to try out on the VIVE. Immediately you find yourself at a mission select screen but no option for a tutorial. While the game recommends doing a tutorial, it fails to mention players had to move away from the menu with and jump to a distant part of the 'overworld' room. The tutorial you get however is a tedious multi phase tutorial for the basic controls, which could have been 3 lines of text prompts in the first mission.With the first 30 minutes of the playthrough already wasted trying to figure♥♥♥♥♥♥out, we proceeded. Unfortunately, it quickly became obvious that we had next to zero options for loadouts or missions to play. Im unsure how the reviews have been so generally positive, perhaps the initial wow factor of VR, but Im sad that Instead of a arcade style shooter with a few different locations and an assortment of weapons which could have just spawned with time or unlocked within a mission, you gotta grind to get even taste of anything new. These tech demos arent good enough to be worth it.So my experience with friends is we took turns playing what seemed to be the same exact mission only longer each time; shooting robots and turning a USB key over and over and over with pistols, slowly unlocking just basic mechanics in the game that should be there from the start. Maybe if I even knew what the unlocks were or when I was going to get them, or hell, if there was some actual variety or story to the game to at least disguise the grind. ♥♥♥♥ me any interaction besides teleporting around and shooting would have been fantastic. We had some fun with Arizona Sunshine because at least there we were walking down a path and had the promise of more weapons along the way.There are much better VR games already and for $49 (more than most AAA releases at the moment) this game falls extremely short of expecations for me."

Wish I knew how to find or start a dual match. After owning many vive titles I can't help but feel slightly exhausted of the wave based shooter genre though. Wish there was more of a multiplayer or story element to games. With all that being said this game is worth a purchase if on sale (20% off frequently) and you run high end hardware (don't bother with anything less than a 980ti imo). It is by far the best visual HTC Vive title I've played (and I've played most the good ones) so you need hardware to heavy lift. My only complaint would be that I would expect more progress on the early access in the near year it has been out.

The difference between blocking projectiles and getting hit seems realistic, i.e. it's not enough to just face in the right direction, but the projectiles are slow enough to give you a chance to get the katana in the right spot. The ability to teleport short distances gives you a great advantage over the AI bots, but I'm guessing they'll get progressively harder in later missions. The graphics are very nice, with a modern/futuristic look, and just looking down at your virtual hands is pretty impressive. There's a good mix of action and strategy, and so far it hasn't gotten boring despite being yet another wave-survival kind of game.Happy to change my vote from a thumbs down to a thumbs up, especially since it's an early access game, so I guess bugs are to be expected, and given that it seems to be quite actively developed, I'm sure it'll just continue to get better."

With Raw Data, it is moved or get killed! So you find yourself ducking behind crates and pulling Tom Cruise action positions... when you realize your out of breath! It is the first game I've felt like living the action. Fun for this reason.2) Challenge: Most of the games have been for like n00bs. Real easy, real friendly, etc. But this is built for a challenge. I've attempted the second level 3 times now... and that's not because it is built poorly, or little tricks, or that I *MYSELF* am a n00b, but because it is hard to dodge, shoot, and protect your health. And that is FUN because it is a real challenge.3) Product in the Making: There are a few things that stand out to me that need to be worked on, and I'm pretty sure they will be taken care of. So a little note that everything is not perfect (it has crashed a couple times, interface is weak, etc.) but hey, VR is new and there will be improvements."

I am actually worried about clearing all the content too quickly because I am having so much fun!I think the best way to describe this game is as a FPS Tower Defense in VR. You have a melee based character (cyber ninja), a ranged character (gun cleric), and a third I have yet to unlock, a support (street merc), which just released. This isn't to say these characters are stuck in these roles. Without spoiling the abilities they unlock, I will simply say those are the best roles for them.Regardless of how you feel about FPS or Tower Defense, I highly recommend this game to everyone. It's a must own. I don't believe I have ever reviewed a game on Steam, but this was so good that I had to.The game is more fun in multiplayer, but there is a matchmaking system as well as a lounge where you can just invite or join randoms. Even with the game being in early access, it's better than a lot of fully released games that are already out there. Definitely pick it up.

I tried other games...you know Vanishing Realms, SPT, Brookhaven Experiment...all of them feel like a tech demos showing off what VR can do at its initial stage and also showing the constrain and limitation of VR's ability to expand into an ACTUAL game.  THIS GAME, RAW DATA stands up above all and show the VR developers there ain't no contraint...you guys just don't know enough about VR.  With the success of this game, hopefully more developers now realize what they can do and jump on board and create more fully fledge contents that VR gamers sorely needed.What makes this game great? Almost everything is great.  The animations, the guns that naturally feel good in your hands, the sword that actually fly, the robots that creep you out, the shooting accuracy, the awesome looking graphics and details of the world, the characters that look cools w/ their own special abilties, a UI menus that actually look like an actual game menu and not some gimmicks that you see in other VR games, the awesome sound and special effects and most importantly, THE COOP is so much fun with the social function play a part into it as well.This is an Early Access but man, i can't wait to see what they have in store.  I have already beaten the levels and unlocked everything and STILL i came back and keep playing the COOP.  No game in VR has this much playability than Raw Data.  I have put a stop to playing every other games since I purchased this game.What i want added for this game:1. Start out each level with a sort of intro (like when the game had you on the elevator with the music kicking in and then it shows the title of the level as you anticipate and wait....that was a moment that capture the beauty of this game.  It needs more of that.  Level 3 and 4 doesn't have that...it needs that...maybe dropping down by helicopter or something like have you sit on the chopter waiting to be drop into the place.2. Horde mode!!!  I know there are challenges and leaderboards but what i want most is a never ending level of constant waves and waves of robots in COOP!!3. More of the indoor levels like walking down the corridor of a hospital with shotgun will be bad♥♥♥♥♥  I know the developers were talking about getting inspirition from Hong Kong flix...well i am sure they know about Hard Boiled in Chow Yun Fat movie...that's the kind of scenrios i want to see in the game.

I am so happy that I found this game, because this alone made my investment into the VIVE really worth it.Of course, RAW DATA also shows its ""early access"" status. There are some crashes, some weird behaviour. There are only two avatars and four levels so far. But the game overall works already so well that I am very confident that it can get only better.If I had a wish for the developers to implement, I would strongly encourage to expand this game away from an arena shooter. The control sceme, the teleporting, it has a high potential to support an extensive gameplay like a Mass Effect does.Some little nitpicking: Inversing hand controls would be nice. Haptic feedback on sword hits would be very much needed, look at how lightsaber-VR has done it. Melee with rocket and charger robots is still a mystery to me, but I am fine if it is indeed only meant to employ dodge-and-teleport tactics.Great game, just get on with the roadmap, I want more of it!!!"

Another thing is when the 'zombie' bots come at you with no legs and are at your feet or grabbing onto you, I feel as though they are too close and get blurry or I end up seeing through them, while at the same time trying to punch them off but they are too close to hit so I end up sparying and praying with my gun towards myself.

The gunplay feels really cool and the sword is awesome. But, I played for a little over an hour and realized that this game basically consists of small levels where waves of robots come at you. The difference between this and the wave shooters is that you can teleport around with a new style of teleporting in which you see kind of a blur when when you move long distances.. like light speed. I like that better than standard teleporting. This is nice, but so far it just feels like the wave shooters. I think you get abilities and stuff and probably different ways to kill these things, but I was a little disappointed that it wasn't more open with a little exploration involved. Also, I can not stand the girl griping at you in your ear the whole time saying things like ""Hurry up"" and ""I thought you trained for this""..It's constant and it's absolutely obnoxious. If they took that out, I might play it again. I will still recommend it because of the technical goodness (the feel of the gameplay and the graphics are very good and unique among current VR games)."

Can't applaud this enough, as it will greatly improve the ""experience"".The gameplay is INCREDIBLE, and you can tell with some optimisation, the game will look _amazing_.For AMD gpu users, the game runs the UE4 engine, which does not play nice with AMD GPUs. The reasons behind the poor performance are unclear, but there are hopes that AMD and Unreal can sort this out.I would not suggest AMD GPU users get this game unless you're running an R9 Fury or higher, and even then 0.8 resolution multiplier is the maximum you can current use in ""busy"" situations.Setup:6600k @ 4.4GHz, 16Gb 3200MHz Ram, R9 Fury X @ 1070/545OLD REVIEW BELOW:Raw Data could be amazing, but is undermined by poor performance. I spent about 2 hours fiddling with settings/""fixes"" to no avail. To make matters worse it is unclear whether the performance issues are bugs with my particular setup or if the game is just poorly implemented. I suspect the latter.Ultimately, VR content absolutely requires to be run at 90fps and the game implementation does not meet this requirement.Rig R9 290X @ 1120core 1500mem, i5 6600k @ 4.4I cannot recommend this at 30quid, even taking its early access state into account."

Unfortunately my concerns about UE4's deferred renderer for the Vive were validated; terrible looking unless cranking options that should not have to be cranked.

,Recommended,436320,29018665,Posted: 4 January,all,cant even ariel,"I am not a fan of this game.It is not bad but I don't think it deserves all the praise it gets. I believe it is only reviewed so well because it came out very early, at a time where nothing else was available. I'm sure it was the best Vive game for a long time, but not anymore.While playing the ninja I found the collision detection between my sword and enemies to be approximate at best. Most of the time all I had to do to thrive in-game was to wiggle my controller in the general direction of the enemies and they would be crushed to death. That's right, crushed. Not sliced, crushed. The samurai sword feels like a baseball bat and that is so very disapointing.I enjoyed the active reloading of the pistol guy but it was too easy. Reloading does not require accurate movements and as a result I just get lazy with it. This kills immersion.I found the level design very bland, with enemies just respawning from the same areas over and over... I guess I just don't find wave shooters to be very engaging.I think the differences between the characters are fun but the shotgun guy definitely requires more effort to play, creating some glaring balancing issues (aka my coop partner got tired when I finally kind of got my pistol groove)Playing with another player makes the game a lot more fun though. COOP plays were a lot of fun! When I was playing with a friend my attention was on him and not on the plain level and enemy design.I heard that unlocking skills greatly improves the experience but I don't think I enjoyed it too enough to grind abilities.Raw Data is good, but it's not the game I choose to play when I launch SteamVR. There are better experiences now.Visually the game is gorgeous, though. As such, it is a great title to showcase VR because it packs a ton of WOW factor. Unfortunately the gameplay was less than wow for me.I suggest you wait for this game to be on sale before buying. Otherwise you may be disappointed.EDIT: after a few hours the gameplay picks up with character-defining skills being unlocked and the later levels not being just one circular room. The first few hours are a chore, the menu is poorly laid out and the server browser/matchmaking is lacking but it's finally getting fun!This is an early acces title and that is unfortunate."

The only weirdness so far is the shotgun (its a bit... odd, considering that your hands don't move once they are ""attached"" to the gun), but other than that everything about the game feels real.You can punch things, slice things with a katana, shoot things with a shotgun (or bash them in the face with the gun if you want), shoot things with pistols, and launch grenades at enemies.Defensively, you can teleport, physically dodge kicks, punches, and projectiles, and deflect incoming fire.The game really requires a larger room (6ft x 6ft or bigger) to really let loose in the game, but you can manage it with a smaller play area. It is hard not to lose track of where the safety grid is, though, with everything going on and how intense the actual gameplay is.To top all of this off, the game is a FULL GAME. There is good voice acting, a story, and multiple missions. There is also multiplayer, though I haven't given that a whirl yet.All in all, the game is superb. It's like blade runner or ghost in the shell, but as a game that you can step into and experience yourself.

Starting as the sword combat character I was instantly in love with warping around and slashing the bots apart, the controls work very intuitivly, though I have no idea why anyone would use 'hold.'I've finished the game on normal and I can't wait to go back through on hard and nightmare!This might already be an option, but a toggle to make the menu button a hold to open would be great as I do accidentally hit that alot in two handed sword mode."

It does require some help with friends or other nearby players, but as far as I can see the multiplayer part doesn't work very well. Had it crash, sometimes it says mission failed, and other times it says no connection to server. Really sad because they can be even more fun in a PvE and PvP moments.

Having played through a couple of scenarios thus far, you mostly stay in the center of the room and stand off against waves of incoming robots that use various attacks against you.  The game does however implement the teleport mechanic that you see in so many Vive games, and it works well.  The weapon controls are also great.  You have to manually reload your guns by grabbing a clip from your belt and inserting it into the gun.  Fortunately, this doesn't require your motions to be precise, so it quickly becomes second nature.  Melee combat is equally intuitive with your strikes, as well as how you physically dodge attacks when enemies are up close.I'll update this review as I play more of the game and its development progresses.  In the meantime, all that's left for me to say is if you already have the hardware, I definitely encourage you to check out this game."

For me it pretty much justifies my purchase of the Vive on it's own!One thing to note is when I first got it the resolution multiplier was set at 0.8 and AA disabled which makes it look pretty bad!  Lots of jaggies!  Once you turn the resolution multiplier up to 1.0 and turn on AA it's the best looking game I've seen on the Vive so far.I've seen a lot of people having performance issues but I think they may have improved it since those posts.  Mine runs very well on a 1080 with all settings at max except shadow quality which is down 1 notch.Pros:+ Very intuitive controls.+ Very little motion sickness bearing in mind how quickly you turn and move around the area and I have had motion sickness from most other games that involve fast movement.  This may just be me getting used to it though.+ So much fun.... seriously I can't stress this enough!+ It's only early access but already more complete than most other full VR games.  And they seem to be rolling out improvement regularly.+ Great graphics.+ I'm pretty sure I'm now a Jedi-ninja now.+ One of the few games that's actually fun to watch other people play.  Which is lucky because it can be hard to get people off it!Cons:- Dangerous for your controllers/TV/people standing too close to the play area!- I've had a few crashes but never during games so I've not lost any progress.  Just means restarting the game occasionally.  I'm sure these will be fixed before the full release.

,Recommended,436320,30933425,Posted: 3 April,all,Skyler2048,"This game is a must-have game for VR. It features top-notch combat with a mediocre story (which, considering other VR games, is not bad). The game is primarily based upon 3 classes (a fourth will be reliesed soon, if you watch the trailer it shows a guy with a bow and arrow, so that's probably what it is) pistols, sword, and shotgun.When I got in, I first tried the pistol class, because it was the default class. He was really good. As I went further with him, and I got all of the upgrades, I had TONS of fun. Then I tried the sword character. Now there are drones in this game, and I sort of took them for granted as being no problem, but the sword class showed me different ways. It was possible to take them out by throwing your sword or with telekanisis, but it taught me just how perfectly balenced this game is. I fully upgraded her, then I moved on to the shotgunner. Eh. My arm got tired wayyyyy too fast to actually utelize him. I have yet to fully upgrade him.As I said before, the story is ok, it's a bit repetitive though. As you get into the game, you realise that there is a pattern. Go down elevator, extract data, random person loses control, robots come to kill you. You kill all the robots. You extract more data. She loses control again. Robots come to kill you. Each level has something unique about it, such as lasers, but soon it gets repetitive. However, it doesn't get old. And Simon the annoying AI eventually turns on you, when before, he was advertising  Eden products. Oh, yeah, Eden. Literally the entire point of the story. Eden is a corrupt government and you are extracting data against them. Cliche as hell. Oh well.Multiplayer. Oh god. The best part, right? What's better than murduring a bunch of killer robots with your BFFs? Well, there are a few problems with that. First of all, multiplayer has a maximum of 2 people total. Eh, that's ok. Well, the second problem with that is, if you are not the host, it is a nest for various glitches. I have only played as the pistol guy and the sword guy in multiplayer, the sword class is not too bad, but the pistol guy is... wel, terrible. It is not uncommon to find that you are not able to reload. That's right. You can't reload. So you have to kill yourself. But this glitch is wayyyy too common for you, and it happens again. It is so terrible that you leave the game and the host is wondering why they have no friends.Aside from almost literally everying I just told you, I cannot stress to yu enough how worth it this game is. It is the best VR experiance I have had so far. It is incredubly well balenced, it gets progressivly harder at a smooth pace, and it's [4 hearts]ing awesome. I pitty those witout a VR."

It is ONE GAME that literally fulfills all my childhood dreams of what VR Games SHOULD BE! Just please don't skimp on your PC! I would say that a 1070 is the ideal minimum, but 980 Ti is even better. Of course GTX 1080 and above are better still. It's not like you can't play this game with a GTX 1060/970 - but you will have to run low quality settings unless you don't mind re-projection anyway, I know because my Bro has a GTX 1060 6 GB i7-6700HK quad core laptop - and it needs minimum. Whereas with my HEAVILY OCed 980 Ti I can run High/Epic settings with a 1.3x/1.4x resolution multiplier."

It's a wave shooter that breaks things up into levels, each of which seems to have 5 waves of enemies (each of which has several sub-waves of enemies).

By the end of the final wave, I'm consistently feeling like I've been pushed to the limits of my skill... and then I pull it out of the fire for a victory."

I am fortunate enough to just meet the Room Size playspace, as this game would simply not be done justice without it. This leads me to my other wonder, as I've been blown up multiple times now is if the teleportation feature isn't standard now to prevent motion sickness? As my character soars across the room from a suicide-bot I brilliantly pulled towards me with TK and slashed downwards at, I realize that my sense of direction is horribly thrown off as the room moves without me."

It is important for everyone to understand that.Now, with that being said, this game has awesome graphics, awesome sound effects/music.  The controls work well, even better than some ""finished"" games being offered lately.  I've only played the gun slinger and will try the sword tomorrow and update this review.The only thing I'm not thrilled about is the reloading of the gun.  The game has you so focused on the action, that it is a bit of a distraction to have to reach down with your other hand to grab a round of bullets and then place it into the gun. Now, is that how life really is... yes. But I think they should offer the option to have you just place your gun down by your hips and it auto loads... something like I've seen in some movies where the clip is sticking out and the gun is pushed down onto it to load.  This by no way is a game breaker... just a quality of life request.BUT! The action - WOW! I have to admit that it is sooo INTENSE! You are focusing on one bot, then another is behind you and your partner on the communicator is telling you to watch out above you... I actually found myself, for the first time dodging, ducking, crouching -- I've not done that with any other VR games - including other FPS games. This game truly immerses you in the virtual world created.This is a great game so far!  I am able to run it flawlessly... I do have a rather powerful system and have everything maxed out. Not sure how it looks for others with lesser systems.  But if you have the rig and you like FPS... this is definitely one to get!

The gameplay can get a bit frustrating - but like with other VR games, skilling up isn't a case of acquiring ever more powerful weapons until you outmatch the enemy in firepower - you have to get physically better at evading and aiming.

It's even more frustrating online, once you finally find a game and play with a partner things do get extremly cool, until of course it crashes.I tried everything, from closing all apps and services to overclocking, underclocking, etc. I shouldn't even have to, I am using a Titan X Pascal and a i7 4970k with 16gb ram. Even then I tried switching from epic graphics settings to high and medium, the game still crashes no matter what I do.Being that this is a steam game and I am using the oculus rift, it is also very annoying that the game crashes me back to the oculus home screen, where it is impossible to launch this game again, so I have to take the helmet off and turn my screen on to launch the game with my mouse.A lot of fun and I am sure the fiinal product will be incredible but right now this game will give you grey hairs due to its instability.EDIT.

I cannot recommend this game enough.Different classes, graphics are spectacular, robots every where, you're rotating your body constantly and now there's locomotion? Come on it just keeps getting better and better.This game showcases VR like it's suppose to.Is this just another wave shooter? Definitely not! There's a bunch of content that makes this game soooo good. Unlike other wave shooters, you don't stand around. You are constantly moving around the map. Also, (pvpvpvpvpvpvpvpvpvp ;) )It's literally a full length game with hours of fun and they're not done yet! Remember guys!10/10 will smash my hand on my desk again"

Multiplayer is available in co-op and PvP.Raw Data is an exceptional game, even in its current Early Access state. The level design is well thought out and implemented. The graphics are jaw droppingly beautiful. The enemy robots are challenging and varied and the weapons /  abilities of the 4 character types are fun to learn and advance with neat upgrades as you progress through the levels.Level design was definitely thoroughly thought out and lovingly designed with beautiful graphics and detail. Instead of standing in a single location, you can move around to confront the hordes of robotic aggressors, taking the battle to them. You have a ""base"" of operations which is where you enter into the level. There is a console from which you need to extract data and while this data extraction is taking place, the robots are deployed in an attempt to stop you. From this base, you can zip around the level using teleportation or use the walk mode. There are generally ramps and platforms which lead from your base to the entry areas where robots start their march to stop you by attacking your base (and you). With Room Scale play, you will be ducking behind containers and consoles in order to avoid being hit by blaster fire, popping back up to return fire on the robots (some of whom also use this tactic against you).Enemy robots come in a wide variety, each with unique abilities. These range from basic dumb drones to ones which are much more capable and are used like a boss /mini-boss on the levels. Don't just focus on the robots walking and running (and sometimes crawling) towards you though as there are flying drones who add to the frenzy, raining shots down upon you and your base from above. The enemy can even upgrade from basic robots to big, hard hitting ones on at least one of the levels which added a great twist to the strategy of how to deal with them.To deal with these robotic killing machines, you can choose from one of 4 different character types, each with a different weapon of choice and abilities unique to that character and weapon. The weapons start out with basic abilities but as your character defeats levels, the abilities for those weapons improve. For example, the handgun starts out with the requirement to reload by grabbing a fresh clip from your hip using your off-hand but then progresses to just lowering the gun down to reload and on to dual wielding.. The varied weapons and upgrades assures some great replay value as each weapon type has its own strengths and weaknesses to master.In addition to the primary weapons at your disposal, you get to place turrets and other helpful additions to the level. These need to be protected as the robots will attack them. You can repair the emplacements if they take damage. These tend to offer limited help as the focus remains upon the player to defeat the advancing robots and to defend the base of operations (and now your turrets). They do offer a little extra breathing room by engaging / slowing enemies while you may be focused on other attackers. Don't rely on these emplacements to handle anything on their own or you may find that your defenses are suddenly gone on your left flank!There are few downsides to the game, which should get addressed as development continues. None of them are show stoppers by any means..1) Swapping weapons to off hand happens too easily in a fight. This I am sure is a frustration which every player of the game has encountered when first starting out. It is far less of a problem now for me but it's a game mechanic which should be addressed by the developers. As it is now, this is a frustrating rite of passage of sorts for new players to learn to avoid doing.2) Menu systems in game need work. The means of enabling special abilities is a little odd and needs to be refined. As it is, I rarely use these special abilities due to the clumsy activation method. Turret menu system can take some getting used to and can be improved. The menu also gets blocked often by other pop-up prompts hovering on your hand, trying to get your attention (such as the prompt telling you to grab a handle to continue to the next phase of a level).3) Training flow needs improvements. It's not always clear what needs to be done to progress the training. Again, this is really for new players as experienced player figure out what needs to be done to move the game forward. There are odd glitches at times with training which frustrates new players.4) AI still needs some refinement as some of the robots seem to get stuck trying to seek out cover. When they do find some protective cover, they sometimes make obviously confused decisions on how to attack. Currently, the AI looks to be in a rudimentary initial stage.Overall, this is an amazing MUST HAVE game and it's still in Early Access! Improvements and features are being added regularly. This is a game which will set the standard for VR wave type games. Throughout the day, I am constantly looking forward to getting back into the game."

While it is technically a ""wave-based shooter"", it feels so much more than that. The best teleportation system in VR (although it has trackpad locomotion too if that is your bag), and sublime gunplay (and swordplay). The missions are challenging and fun to replay on harder settings. The power-ups are fun and give the game a great sense of progression.For the longest time Raw Data has been the benchmark for quality in VR for me. The graphics are superb, and the game feels very much like a polished fully fleshed out game (unlike far too many unfinished and bite-sized VR experiences). If you have a VR headset then you MUST own Raw Data. With single player, co-op and PVP and several different play styles, there is something for everyone (or at least everyone that enjoys VR shooters).In the years to come, Raw Data will be looked back upon as a landmark VR game!"

,Recommended,436320,35074119,Posted: 19 September,all,crazyfrog,"Raw Data is pretty fun, mostly just a wave shooter with a new PVP aspect added to it.There are four main weapons for each class, the pistol (dual pistols thru upgradin'), the katana, the shotgun, and a bow. The pistol class is generally the one you want to start out with as its the most straight foward out of all the classes. The katana class is also good, although frustrating in solo when the drones come flying out its difficult to hit them. The shotgun class is nice too and makes short work of enemies in close range. The bow class is harder at first to use however if you're familiar with other VR bow games like in the lab, you'll adjust more comfortably. My preference is mainly the bow class especially in PVP with homing arrows you'll be poppin off kills left and rightThe PVP is great fun, and where most of my time in this game has come from, however there aren't that many players and oftentimes I find myself playing against like 1 other player or an empty lobby. When there's a populated lobby however, the experience is well worth it."

Games that go down in history.  Raw Data, is that game for VR.  Graphics, play control, immersion, story, and gameplay are all better than they have a right to be.  If you have a VR system, get Raw Data.  You won't regret it!"

The only character I have not completely unlocked is the archer but once I do I'll update this review. The guy with the shotgun bugs out here and there, it doesn't register when you pump and sometimes the bullets stick mid air. The dual pistols are by far my favorite, and the swords are pretty sweet. I like the options of laying out shields and lasers to the data cores. The mortars seem a little less useful if you're using them for protection against the data core.The maps are great, the train map is probably my favorite but I have yet to unlock level 10.I don't spend a whole lot of time with this game, I usually play it when I want a small break from other games."

I'm in the extream of playtime I'd say, but the game is so gosh darn fun.  I've had some great times in CO-OP getting drunk and killing robots.  The new difficulty modes make it even more fun.  Can not suggest this game enough.At full release the game is phenomenal!   It looks and plays like a dream."
