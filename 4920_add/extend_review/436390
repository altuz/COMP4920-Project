You can get it for free if you buy atheir bigger game 'Hot Guns'.+ works smoothly, no lag+ quality pixel art, lively 'breathing' animations, rag-doll-like fragmentation, shooting guns and other effects feel extra persuasive, very fine textures - a feast for the eyes, prime style!+ puzzles seem logical- sadly it's not an adventure game, like 'Cave Story' in undergroung prison compound setting))Обычно нелюблю платформенные головоломки и игры на движке Единство, но эта крутая! Вы получите ее бесплатно при покупке их большой игры ""Горячие пушки"".+ работает четко без тормозов+ качественная точечная графика, живая ""дышащая"" мультипликация, крайне убедительные эффекты вроде стрельбы и разваливания на части, отличные текстуры - пиршество для глаз, первый класс!+ задачки вроде логичные- к несчастью это не приключенческая игра типа ""Пещерной истории"" в обстановке подземного тюремного комплекса))"

Levels are all really challenging, a single mistake will make you fail and restart the level.  Because yes, there is NO checkpoint system. You will probaly rage many times as I did. But still I couldn't stop play, addictive!"
,Recommended,436390,35232509,Posted: 26 September,all,Hybrid,"Was surprised at how fun and addictive this game was. It certainly starts off pretty easy but I didn't expect it to get much more challenging as you progress, fortunately it did.It's a very well put together 2d game worth checking out.  Get it on sale if you're truly short on funds but overall the $3 they're asking is pretty legit."

,Recommended,436390,34525464,Posted: 27 August,all,Ezekiel,"This Game was so funny and frustrating at the same Time.You often get punished for small mistakes you made, either you´ll die - or you´re stuck in a weird spot and can´t continue, cause you destroyed that stupid Box you would have needed.I´m not one of those completely chilled People out there, so that Game sometimes turned on my inner flames.But still, it was worth the Price and the Time I spent for it."
,Recommended,436390,29256292,Posted: 14 January,all,RetroHellspawn,"This is a great game for the price, but buyer beware, you will be beating your head against the wall once you hit level 8 or so in the first cell block with one of the biggest difficulty spikes I've seen in a game like this. I'd almost say this a combination of BroForce and the puzzle mechanics of something like Half-Life or Portal which takes the run-n-gun almost completely out of the game ironically enough. These puzzles will make you question just how in the hell the developers expect you to actually do it, and you'll keep bashing your head against the wall until finally, you see the solution. But considering I got the game for 41 cents after using the 45 cents or so in my steam wallet from selling trading cards, and then getting more trading cards from the game, it's worth it just for the intro levels alone, but those who have the patience may find a gem here. :)"
,Recommended,436390,30031754,Posted: 19 February,all,Laika,"Prison Run and Gun is an excellent game. The puzzles are quite hard sometimes and you really need patience to finish the game. It took me more than 8 hours to beat the game and get all achievements. Sometimes I had to play a level more than a hundred times. But the more I tried the more satisfying it was to finish a hard level.You should be aware that there are no checkpoints in the levels, so if you make one mistake you have to play the whole level again. That can be frustrating at times, but it also makes you think your actions twice.I bought the game when it was on sale but I think it's totally worth the whole price (which is currently 2 €). It's a challenging and fun game and I totally recommend playing it."

,Recommended,436390,32569602,Posted: 19 June,all,St.Nyess,"Firstly like all other platform games it is cancerous and gets your nerves easily my recommend to people who gets angry quickly shouldn't play this game to keep their brain on their head.Prepare to ragequit every 10min.But to hardcore lovers this game if perfect difficulty starts from even on 3rd level and goes on.Prison concept is great,you try to escape from it by fighting against mostly mines,boxes and some guards.It does support controller which gives you more fun.Struggling to complete levels gives you patience and dying constantly gives you incourage.Map designs are good but i would love to see more guards,guns or armor types.Settings are kinda undetailed,controls settings are also undetailed.Soundtrack is not great but not bad.There is no checkpoint feature so if you die last meters of completing level you gotta start over.Some pixel-art gamer might really like this game.It has very good texture.After all you can have old school type of fun and peace of mind after completing all levels.It has really low price and you can spend your hours on this game so that money will worth it.!!! 5/10 !!!"

,Not Recommended,436390,25276305,"Posted: 31 August, 2016",all,Denilson Sá,"Poorly designed, feels unpolished.The game looks nice, and has a very good idea behind it. It is a puzzle-action-platformer. Your objective is to reach the end of each level, and you need to think how to navigate the environment and how to interact with it in order to complete the level.However, it has several faults:- No mouse support on the menus.- Nonsensical button prompts (""A"", ""B"") if you play with the keyboard.- Poor default keyboard bindings: arrows and I/O/P keys. The hand position on the keyboard feels cramped and uncomfortable.- Destructible brick walls look like the brick background.- Incomplete/insufficient player training for the techniques required to complete the levels. For instance:you need to throw your weapon while jumping to make it land on a higher platformandthe yellow suit can be used to jump higher at the end of level 11, which is something that is not shown or explained- I hate throwing the weapon because it never lands where I want it to. It feels unpredictable (even though I believe it isn't).- It is easy to screw up and require either a suicide or a level restart.- Since restarting a level is something so common, it should be easier to do (currently we need to press Esc, then use the arrows to select Restart, and then press the fire key).- There are no checkpoints. Be prepared to restart the same level several times.Level 11 was boring/frustrating because it was a bit longer and required me to redo the same parts over and over and over.I can see the level design is nice, the puzzles are well thought. I wish I could enjoy this game. I wish I could feel challenged on how to complete the levels. But instead I ended up feeling bored (of redoing the same parts over and over) and frustrated (ragequit after failing a level and thinking I had to redo it again). Instead of forcing me to think on how to solve the puzzles, the game made me careless (doing this part yet again? let me do it as quickly as possible) and afraid of experimenting (why should I try something different if the cost is too high?)."

,Recommended,436390,33442695,Posted: 10 July,all,UlverHausu,"Prison RunORGUNOne the two Spin off/prequels,  that introduce a character from the game Hot Guns.I didnt realize this was a puzzle platformer. In my defense, that's one misleading title right there.It's a short game, that saw release on Android devices but not entirely a direct port from that version, some levels were redesigned to prevent skipping certain puzzles.Its alright, the levels are short and easily solvable, it requires a small deal of speed and timing, and as the title implies, the option to run or shoot. At some points may require some malabarism to throw a weapon to a place you might later reach.It  works fine with a controller, not sure if the same can be said with a keyboardOne thing is missing, that easy a quick restart button, usually Y or Triangle, are used in similar games, but not here. Lame, that the PC version can't use more than 2 buttons.Also level 30 is blocked and requires 100% completion by collecting all keys. Im Not a fan of locking the main story like that, usually that sort of thing is reserved with a reward outside the main story to the players that really enjoyed the game.FINAL SCORE: 6/10"
