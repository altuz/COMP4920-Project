However, there is no justification for charging $12 for a game that took barely an hour to complete and which has absolutely no replay value. The gameplay was incredibly simple and just not that much fun. I heard that this game was originally for mobile VR, so maybe it's better on those setups, but on the vive it's just not worth it. Stay clear unless you don't mind an incredibly short experience that isn't that much fun."

I managed to learn how to sail the seas, take over a ship, kill some pirates.  I noticed you can upgrade your ship!  That's a good thing.  Sound is excellent, voice acting ranges from great to okay!Controls are vive controllers.  They managed to get them to work like expected.  This is a very good sign."

Sadly this is barely a mini-game and maybe would be worth 1-2 bucks but surely no 12.....There are a million times better VR games out there. Don't buy this one
,Recommended,436400,29735545,Posted: 5 February,all,Baphomet,"Heroes of the Seven Seas is a VR pirate adventure that’s not particularly lengthy but still manages to impress if only by its gameplay. The graphics are not particularly great and resemble an early PS2 era game. The naval combat however, is actually quite fun and the game keeps adding new weapons and objectives to keep things interesting. There’s also a fairly challenging wave shooter sequence at the very end of the game.This is a title worth trying but you shouldn’t go into it expecting a whole lot, nor to spend more than an hour (par for the course for most VR experiences)."

The gameplay is extremely fun and cartoony-ish. Sailing a pirate ship in VR is fun and fancy entertainment!The difficulty of boarding ships has something to be said though.... it was super easy but I've only done one. Hopefully there are more to be seen!! YAHR!!!

The first pirate and sailling game on VR for now.+ fun naval battle+ fun Vive control ( the rudder control is dream fullfilling )+ good VR experience+ some stunning scens like huge whale- graphics is mobile class (i foud it's an original mobile game explans the graphics thing).- need multiplayer !!!Considering to other so call VR games( turned out to be demos ), this is nearly a complete game. Have problems and obvious shortcomings but worth the money.If you have HTC, Should have one."

Simple and effective cartoonish graphic, works great on 1.8 Super Sample on G1 1080 and we all know that definition is more important than detail in VR. Feels like being in Monkey Island, and gameplay seems to be quite good as well. So far i really reccomend it."

,Recommended,436400,26104056,"Posted: 18 October, 2016",all,CoderX,Controls get wonky at times and should be tweaked to make the sailing and sea battles more enjoyable. The game is way too short.The above said. I had a blast playing it and look forward to more VR games like this.
76561198339249838,Recommended,436400,26103875,"Posted: 18 October, 2016",all,sluusasf,"It's a super fun game. I would say it's a very cool and well designed story, with VR i can totally feel i am the pirate doing all the shooting and other activities in the game! I can also choose to upgrade my ship and use different weapons, the contents are rich, so i can take my time to try out different things. Highly recommended!!!"
,Recommended,436400,32158694,Posted: 3 June,all,Brandon,"This is a must-have game. I don't know if the developer(s) are MIA now or planning updates, but this is a top-10 VR game, but pretty short. At $13 it's still a steal. I would gladly pay $30+ for more content. The potential for multiplayer battles is HUGE. Love the graphics style and game play. Don't hesitate, buy this.Disclaimer: I bought this myself, played a while ago, just now coming back to review."
,Not Recommended,436400,32793567,Posted: 25 June,all,cacographeld,"I really don't understand how this has positive reviews, thank god it was cheap since the whole game feels exactly that.Scaling is ♥♥♥♥ed UP. First scene in the boat, there's a guy in the ocean who is about 5x bigger than you who is supposed to be a crewmate to rescue. Gunplay is a standard point and click affair where enemies beeline towards you, ship combat seems shallow and it just made me start shooting their crew anyway after I hit them twice with my cannons?The screenshots paint a picture in your mind of some amazing action packed adventure, but what you get feels like some assets slapped together quickly to make a VR game.And this is it in a ""finished"" state? Just don't buy it. Or at least, buy it when it's on sale if you really love to try out every ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game out there like myself."

Or hope there's a Part II*Overall strongly recommanded."

76561198058602281,Recommended,436400,28929070,Posted: 1 January,all,Controversy,"The potential for this game is insane. Seriously. The ship aspect of it is extremely fun. Building your ship, going on missions... omg. When I was in harbor and walking around, talking to the NPCs reminded me of games like FF7 where it was actually fun to see what the natives had to say about certain things. Being able to explore big towns while in port would be amazing.The 1st person fights are pretty cool too. I would love the addition of a sword so you can pick between shooting people or melee fighting.If you make this a 20 hour or so game that is sand boxy but also has a ton of side quests and content, this could easily be one of the best VR games.I want more ships in my pirate armada that I can collect.I'd like a crew I can customize and gear up.   I would also like to be able to gear myself up, like in most RPGs.I would LOVE IT if you added voice command so you can just YELL at your crew to move the ship... like a real pirate captain would do. Either that or add a head movement, so if you tilt your head left, the ship goes left. Tilt it right and the ship goes right. Other VR games have done this with great success.The weapon targetting felt good. It got a little crazy when I was also trying to steer the ship, hense the suggestions on alternate ways to move the ship.The teleport options feels OK. I would like a simple push a button and move forward option. I know this option gives a ton of people motion sickness, but there are also a ton of people who do not experience motion sickness at all, and simply moving through the world feels better for us.I am very happy with it I just wish it was longer :(Great job!/heavy breathing"
76561198063942102,Recommended,436400,32671045,Posted: 23 June,all,PS5Owner,Finished the game.  It's fun. The core gameplay mechanic is fun.  I might play it again to see if there's anything to unlock.
