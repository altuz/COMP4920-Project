,Recommended,436490,22295235,"Posted: 7 April, 2016",all,KJack,"I will admint, when I first got my Vive I was simply... whelmed.  Not overwhelmed, not underwhelmed, but whelmed - lukewarm.  I had concerns about resolution, clarity, and comfort.  Were my lighthouses setup right?  Is this going in the drawer in a week?  I was really starting to doubt my purchase.Then I loaded up La Peri.  Like another reviewer, I didn't buy this game for me - I figured that ballet would be fun for my daugher.  But being a responsible parent, I wanted to experience it first and make sure there wasn't anything that was going to jump scare her or be a problem.My preconceived notions have never been quite this wrong.  This ""experience"" is a totally new medium.  This isn't a play, or a ballet, or even interactive theater.  This is theater of the real.  In every way, the neurons in my brain believed 110% that I was standing on the stage.  Looking over the cliff.  Watching the dancer whirl around me.The environments are breathtaking.  The flashlight seems out-of-place at first, but I quickly realized that it only further sold my brain on the reality of what I was seeing.  I spent 5 minute examining a scultpure with my eyes, my flashlight, and my physical positioning.  I held my breath as the dancer whooshed through me.  Felt real empathy when she was in peril.  Real thought behind the game's final choice.The medium of VR storytelling was born this week.  A completely new way to communicate and express art just came into being.  And La Peri is an excellent first example of what that medium is capable of.  After experiencing this performance, I had to sit down and be introspective for about 10 minutes just to regain my emotional grounding.  Yes, it's that good.Stop reading this review and buy it.  Enjoy the first coming of the new VR art form.  Transport yourself to a world far away from where you're physically standing.Bravo, La Peri.  Merci."

Wow, to think out that I might of missed out on this treasure. Truly inspirational and very well done. It was entertaining and much more comprehensive than I thought it would be. Clearly other developers should hire dancers to mocap—I felt much more connected and immersed because I knew there was a human in the movement I was seeing.Don't miss this one—well worth the $."

I had the original so this was a free upgrade for me.I am wowed again. This is a stunning exhibition of talent by these guys. I cannot wait to see what Innerspace have in store for us Vive owners next, the mind boggles.The new additions add a lot to the experience. John Rhys-Davies is brilliant as usual. The addition of the book (love the gold foil effect) and the enhanced graphics make the whole experience seem longer (probably is now). The acoustics are as good as always, beautiful music.I know this might not seem like it might suit everyone's taste, but I cannot recommend it enough.

If this is your first VR experience, you may be amazed, but then you would also be amazed batting around a VR balloon or picking up a virtual cup. For those of us used to VR, it's not guaranteed to be an especially exciting experience.In this VR 'demo', you simply stand there, grab four items and.....it finishes. It seems over in minutes.Yes, watching someone dance was 'interesting', but reading the reviews, you would think this were some jaw-dropping VR experience and in my opinion, it's really not. If you want to show your friends the wonders of VR, this would be one of the last examples I would choose.Almost everything you see is included in the pictures above.I appreciate what developers do, honestly I do, but I 'played' this game / experience and was left saying ""Oh...that's it?"" and I took off my headset and did something else."

,Recommended,436490,23761080,"Posted: 24 June, 2016",all,LMAONAISE,"If you are into the more experience based titles, this may be for you. La Peri is very much in the same vein as The Blu, the apolo experience etc.Pros:- There wasn't any point where I felt confused with my task, although there is minimal interaction the game does make you feel involved, and succeeds in putting you not just front and center, but in the middle of a ballet experience.- If you really indulge in the story it can be quite captivating. The narration is excellent.- Frame rates and performance was great on my gtx970, game seems well optimized.- There was a good balance between having your feet on the ground and parts where you'd experience virtigo.Cons:- The flashlight was annoying, I really just wanted it off for most of the experience and wish I could disable it. Making sure I had it behind my back took a bit away from the experience.- Wish there were more human dancers, maybe another scene with two dancers or an extra scene... the animals were amazing, but the dancer... WOW... I want more of that!- Scale seems slightly off with regards to the models, I felt the dancer was too small by 5-10 %.- Too short. I'm not particularly frugal, but I feel like it could have been longer for my $10 spent. That being said, this caters to a smaller demographic in an already 'petite' VR community... so $10 isn't that absurd if it means I'm supporting these devs.- End of the game had no prompts... just went black. I didn't know if there was more coming or if it had glitched... just black.- All of the above is me being nit-picky, if this was twice as long of an experience, it would be perfect IMO."

It's experiencing a new form of ""Art"" rather than playing a game.   It's very short - about 15 minutes.  I'm not sure it's worth the money they are asking for it - get it on sale if you can; but it is thouroughly enjoyable, and something that should be in your library as a demo for friends to introduce them to what it feels like to be in VR, in a non-stressfull situation."

In this case the sense of presence of the dancer in the final scene is overwhelming and cannot be ignored. One of the few offerings at this time (late 2016) to convey such feelings.

,Recommended,436490,25377183,"Posted: 6 September, 2016",all,Bassem,"High quality experience and perfect material for demoing to othersA ballet from 1912, La Peri tells the story of a Persian prince seeking immortality and trying to steal it from a Peri, a fairy-like spirit. Here it's translated into an interactive experience from the point of view of the prince.I think of it not as short butcondensed. It's a perfect intro to VR for friends, family and VR-curious guests, because it eases a user into the basics of looking all around them, and using the controllers to interact with objects, all while offering a high quality experience that looks and sounds gorgeous and is emotionally and physically engaging.It's absolutely worth the price.The visuals are highly professional - no hasty VR game there. Peering around with the flashlight at the detailed sets that are lowered and raised around you as you stand on a stage. And the creatures that dance around you look great.The music is not only beautiful but interactive, especially in the dance sections, as you try to grab objects and it reacts to you.The narration by John Rhys-Davies is perfect - I can't imagine anyone else in the role. His booming voice and careful eloquence set the mood for each scene.The final dance overwhelmed me, with its swelling music and ballet routine and the Peri's sensuous whispering, and had me batting at my headset trying to get some tears out of my eyes.I do wish the previous ""dances"" had more substance to them. That's one negative. Another is too many transitions back and forth from the stage to the story scenes.All in all though, I'm very glad I experienced it, and it always gets a great reaction from people I show it to. I hope more such professionally made, longer storytelling & artistic experiences come to VR."

The first 3 are INCREDIBLY short (10-15 sec) moments of gameplay, and the final part features the actual dance. They call these sections dances, but the only one where dancing occurs is the last.As a customer I was expecting multiple dances, and getting to either view the performance as an audience member or up on stage. I didn't care much at all about interacting, I just wanted to see the performance. I would show this game to friends if there were a way to fast forward to the only dance in the game, at the end.

Firebird: La Peri places you center-stage in a stylish and whimsical short fantasy in which you bring a dancing enchantress to life and are given the choice of helping her fulfilling her destiny.This, in my opinion, is the perfect opus for a VR experience as it elegantly channels the core of story telling in an engaging and charismatic fashion that only dedicated story tellers are capable of doing. Think of it as a more refined ""Disney"" fairy tale presentation that is very palatable for adult audiences. I was left wanting more and am looking forward to Innerspace VR's future presentations."

Not a game but a VR theatrical presentation which the developers state was inspired by Walt Disney's ""Fantasia"" and I feel they have more than suceeded in matching the combination of music, storytelling, dance and art that Disney was aiming for in his ground breaking film. Unlike watching a movie or ballet in the theater, you are now on stage with the sets and action around you. It really does create moments of breathtaking magic that could not be experienced any way but in room scale VR. This, to me, is the true beginning of VR entertainment.I'm sure the game crowd will find this rather dull as there is limited interaction but this should be considered a work of art and not a game. I for one feel it is well worth the price and look forward to any further improvments Innerspace VR makes to the final version.

I hope to see more of this sort of thing in the future!The long:  Being someone who does not ""get"" dance at all, I was not expecting to be blown away by this one.  However, I knew I liked the music, and it looked really nice (with some aesthetic similarities to Superhot, Tron Legacy, and Journey's wall art, at least), so I gave it a try.Turns out this game is really well polished, from various visual aspects to the music and music transitions to the narration (English, anyway; I haven't listened to the others) to the general presentation -- classy stuff.  The only real hitch was that some achievements didn't come through my first time playing, but I don't give a hoot about those.  What they hint at, however, is that there are a few secret things and non-obvious interactions which make it more than just the ""look/click-to-continue VR movie"" I was expecting it to be.  The narration even gracefully allows for several deviations from what I assume is the standard story, which makes me kind of curious if real-life performances normally respond to audiences in similar fashion.  For those interested in VR spaces, the movement of the stage pieces and the fades between that ""reality"" and the story world's is really cool and worth watching several times, in my opinion.  There's at least one giant clip that you might see if you're looking for things like that, but that's the only worldly blemish I remember.  Oh, and the pit is not fully modeled and doesn't have an orchestra in it, but it's there, even though I had to stick my head through a wall to see it.  :)"

It feels like the developer said, ""We got access to a headset, a motion capture suit, and a ballerina, what can we do with that?"" That being said, what's there isn't bad. It's not great either.They tried to make it like you're on a stage as the performance goes on, but the stage itself is somewhat ugly and clashes with the rest of the look. The environment doesn't do the characters justice. The interaction, meaning the 4-5 times you actually do something, feels very tacked on and imprecise, and when you actually do something, it's always binary. Your interaction is as simple in nature as point and click. It builds to a moment when the dancer is dancing circles around you and it feels almost playful and captivating and you're getting drawn in and you're smiling and feeling sort of off balance by it all... then it ends. Honestly, if they had kept it up for a few more scenes it would be great.Unless you're desperate for content I'd recommend you pass."

But the writing is on the wall when the opening menu has an option to skip to the last dance. It should read skip to the only dance. Because the rest of it is just trying to grab a petal from something that either runs or flies around you. There's no dancing and it's not visually impressive unless you have never experienced VR before (in which case, there are better options). It's just a chance to smash your house up.So really you have the opening, where you're on a stage as the scene is set for a show - which is good but mostly in a hey, I'm on a VR stage sort of way - and the final dance. The final dance is well animated and has beautiful music, but it's maybe a minute or two. And really the polygonal style doesn't fit the spirit of grace subject matter well at all.Ultimately if you want to throw some money at trying all the different sorts of VR experience, this is definitely something different. But once the novelty wears off products are going to have to start providing a lot more substance to justify their price tag.
