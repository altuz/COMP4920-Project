76561198238615952,Recommended,436530,22291428,"Posted: 7 April, 2016",all,Jules Caesar,"I just bought this one because it was so cheap. I have to admit I didn't expect too much, but it kept me playing for a few hours. My opinion, after playing it, is that Bullshot is a real bargain.The pros:A lot of references and tributes to old arcade games and movies (You break a car like in 'Street Fighter', ride a bike like in 'Sly Spy', and in the trailer I saw you'll have to kill a heart like in 'Contra'. This can't be just coincidence.).Franky charging at the enemies. (Best melee attack ever!! XD )Good gameplay.Trading cards are awesome!! XDMusic (I really liked this one!!).Less than 1$(The price raised recently, it's still a cheap one, anyway).Great developer support and the updates keep a good pace.The cons:It looks like it's a little short at this moment. Maybe it's not a real con, as developers say it will have 8 or 10 levels (it has 3 plus 3 bonus right now).(The game is frequently updated and developers are adding levels almost every week. It has 6 plus 3 bonus now).Took a little to find out how to play (there's a help image showing the controls but it's ""hidden"" in the options).Difficulty is maybe too high at some points. I'm also not sure if it's really bad, as it makes Bullshot look more like the old arcade games.The 'retro TV filter'. It looks funny for a while, but fortunately you can turn it off (and the game looks better without it)."
,Not Recommended,436530,28098296,"Posted: 30 November, 2016",all,rgk,"Bullshot is a run'n'gun game with lots of 360° shooting and a little bit of platforming. With its Duke Nukem style, Terminator references and pre-rendered 3D art style in the vein of Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee, Bullshot titillates the nostalgia fibre of the late 90s. Quite a nice change of pace from all the pixel shooters we have seen in the recent years.While the design is really nice and the levels look good, some early levels are really dark and it gets hard to see where the ladders to progress are located (they should have been colored rather than left black). Furthermore, it can sometimes become difficult to tell apart the enemies from the background but at least they shoot to politely make their presence known; unlike those pesky passive ladders. The horror culminates in the Sewers level, really hard to navigate, no checkpoint and insta-death toxic pools. No wonder less than 4% of the players made it past this level. After the Sewers, the next levels are much better. Gorgeous, easier to navigate and with a better level design.Another issue with this game is the core gunplay. Most weapons are garbage, they have a low range and rate of fire. Worst than that, there is no dedicated key for each one, the player has to switch between them one by one. Only the missile launcher is more fun to play, but it has a very limited number of ammo. This leaves us with the base weapon, a machinegun that is very efficient (fast, long range) and becomes a staple for clearing the levels. Except that the feeling of this weapon is non-existent. It has no weight to the shots, completely braindead to use. Perhaps a slower time of flight and rate of fire would have made the gunplay feel more interesting. The games BUTCHER and RIVE do a much better job in that department.The rest of the game mechanics are fairly good, with the ability to charge enemies for an insta-kill (beware when they can explode on your face!) and a cover button to hide in the background (can be used anywhere) and overall give more tools for the fights. There is also a bit of variety in the intermission levels, like riding a bike or controlling a mecha. The game can be finished in about 4h, but since it is very cheap this is not really a problem. The levels all look cool and different, and added to the final bloodbath it all makes a very satisfying adventure despite the lackluster beginning. What's missing also is spicing up the arenas, very few run'n'guns are actually successful in that department (RIVE).As a conclusion, I do not think Bullshot is a good game because its main activity (the shooting) is not very well done. Furthermore, the early levels are hard to navigate and really lack checkpoints. However, the rest of the game is actually a quite solid foundation and show that the game is not a bad one either. It has a lot of potential, so I hope that the developpers will take heed from the criticism, improve their formula and create an amazing game.I am trying not to take the price into account as to whether to recommend or not, but needless to say that at dirt cheap you can take it just for the art style. I find it hard to give it a thumbs up, I wish there was a ""neutral"" button because Bullshot does not deserve a thumbs down either.Here is the video review:https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=808012232For more reviews by me (and a few others), check out this website:http://saveorquit.com/author/8rgk/"
76561197989273094,Recommended,436530,23144008,"Posted: 22 May, 2016",all,War,"A very solid side scroller which reminds me greatly of Contra and the original DukeNukem. The graphical options are cute and gameplay is fairly typical of traidtional side scrollers--with mouse aiming. Play is fun, though there is a limitation in the raw number of levels-but then it is still an early access release.My greatest ""complaint"" is the jump mechanic. I find the game is vertically unforgiving, with some areas being missed if one drops too low too quickly.The collectable mechanic is typical of many side-scrollers, though I have found some ""wall clipping"" issues (the sewer level for one turtle for example) which have forced a restart of the level--though the collectable was still counted.Mid-level save flags, reminicient of Mario, are helpful, however, all stockpiled weapons are typically deleted--which can make for some difficulties if the level is new to the player.Weapon options are still thin, with 4 primary weapons available (Unlimited ammo base machine gun, flamer, rocket launcher, grenade launcher). Ammunition is very limited for the flamer and rocket launcher (the weapons I've also found have the least utility unless opening a wall etc.) The nade launcher was useful for blowing open some floors and vs. a particular boss but otherwise I've found the best utility from the starter machine gun. Some additional development to make the lesser used weapons more viable is hopefully on the horizon.Levels are generally well designed and fun--if you enjoy the side scrolling format. The ""hide in the shadows"" element can be useful and the bull charge is fun.Boss mechanics are generally well done, with identifiable patterns if one is paying attention.Overall, this is an enjoyable ""time-waster"" with a limited backstory and a fair bit of humour with references to other games and shows/movies."

The overall style is also nice.The gameplay is pretty good, the only complaints i have are:1. The character walks a bit too slow for my liking (but maybe that's me).2. The character jumps a second after i press space (but this can offcourse be fixed).You have about ten levels and a bit of a story.It's just a run and gun, but a really fun oneIt's overall just a fun little game that has enough to offer for its price.If you are thinking about buying it, you should its totally worth the price"

Ryu,"Updated Review on 7 May 2016Although I haven't tried the controller, I would like to change this review and give it a ""yes"" for recommendation.1.) Nice game play, good level balance; (It is not an easy game, just at the right point, FUN)2.) Very nice developer- Efficient, polite, patient replies for help & support- Passion shown through seeking space for improvementFor now, I don't know about other players, but if for those who use 15"" MacBook,remember to set it at 1280 x 800, and change the filter to something other than old TV mode to prevent offset cursor.As mentioned by developer, the control config will be better.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Old Review:The gameplay is good.However, the control setting is confusing.It requires player to import or config a controller setting before launching a game.And before players click play, there is another controller config page.In game, there is another controll setting page. Which one should I use?The gameplay requires players to aim with the cursor which you can move it with mouse or gamepad.Yet, the character is not really shooting at the cursor's direction.And it is hard to control it with gamepad since I don't know why the cursor will stick at the position where the mouse or touchpad was.Honestly, I really like the gameplay itself, please fix these so I can give it a yes for recommendation."

The look of game, music and same retro game mechanics is great, but gameplay is awful and story… truly saying there is no story. So many times I was buried in textures. The worst is when the level is near to end and it happens. Sometimes in such dead zones without exit I found game objects, so maybe it was idea in it. Next minus is amount of levels, why so few? I played about 2 hours and it is  more then 3/2 of game. Achievements almost all in first location.Can I recomend this game? I think the answer is yes. Because it is realy cheap and game worth the money, but only for people who older then 20.Think twise."

,Not Recommended,436530,25134516,"Posted: 25 August, 2016",all,Raptor85,"It TRIES to be a callback to the old DOS game era (pretty clearly from the Duke Nukem inspired cover art) but misses most of what made those games good while copying what sucked about them.  The sound is just full on bad, it's impossible to tell what's going on, PC speaker bleeps and bloops were better at conveying that then the poorly sampled, extremely repetitive audio in this game. Enemies just spawn in over and over and you have to clear rooms to progress, theres no real exploration, just following room to room killing enemies.  Even the bosses are re-used a lot.  The levels are just completely uninspired, lots of copy-paste to make them bigger."

It's still early access and maybe it'll be improved, but if you're looking for a good multiplayer game maybe Bullshot is not what you're looking for.I recommend the game because I liked a lot the story mode, and to me it deserves the price. From the intro that mimics the PS to the retro tv look, Bullshot gave me great nostalgia of the 90's arcade games."

Enemy fire is near impossible to dodge. Too hard a game to bother. Don't get this.Edit: This game is solid after playing again with a different mindset. You have to play this game at a slower pace, don't expect this to be run n gun. Tip: You can blow up enemy missiles by shooting them while in the air. I like the difficulty of this game so far, perhaps if the developer throws in a slightly easier setting that drops an extra health pack it could ease new players in. The game levels are short so I imagine replaying levels at higher difficulty is no problem/won't take too much time."
