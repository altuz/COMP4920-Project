Refund.There are some who seek to make themselves a recognized critic, some are just doing it because its trendy.Please stop. There are plenty of great games with mixed reviews that are actually really solid games, if only complainingwasen't so popular."

Finally, a new adventure worthy of my time!I rolled myself a fine dwarven character, a cleric named Merrygold. With a blessed hammer and a joyous beard I set forth, landing in the bustling town of Everdale. What astonishing tales awaited me? What luminous treasure anticipated my hand at the bottom of a dark dungeon?Ready for romance and danger I walked through the buildings, smiling as I examined the many races with various professions. I found myself inside a tavern, where a handful of weary travelrs rested. Suddenly, a man burst inside, calling out on voice chat in a strange accent-""WOULD ANYONE LIKE TO ACCOMPANY ME TO SLAY SOME MONSTERS AND♥♥♥♥♥♥""A strange way of wording, but I decided I would answer his call nontheless. I was about to respond to his summon when someone in the back of the room called out""SHUT THE F**K UP YOU DAMN DIRTY ELF. THIS IS AN ORC BAR.""The two then proceeded to bicker and insult each other's mothers, while a man jumped from the top of the balcony and recited what seemed like the entire speech from Helm's Deep.Deciding my journey lied elsewhere, I ventured to the town square, where a great statue of a courageous warrior stood. Admiring its craftmanship, I was just about to further inspect it when suddenly a robed man carrying a staff appeared at the top by some sort of teleportation spell.""I AM YOUR KING. YOU ARE ALL PEASANTS TO ME.""This he cried out, before proceeding to rain great, firey meteors down, which the good people seemed to mostly ignore.Feeling confused but still hopeful, I finally decided to try my combatical prowess in a dungeon. Onward I went, preparing myself for what was sure to be the fight of my life. I readied my hammer and prayed to my God, opening the first door in this accursed place.Then a skeleton stunlocked me and I died immediately.Actual Opinion:You've probably read about the mechancis and bugs of this game, so I'm not going to talk that much about them. What I will say is that yes, the mechanics are solid and fun, and yes, at the current moment the game is ridden with bugs.But hands down, my favorite feature so far is the voice chat. Everyone roleplays- badly. It's pretty damn funny. I really hope this game continues to be updated and gets at -least- a small loyal following, because I can 100% see this game having a fantastic community.I followed a guy around the town for about ten minutes narrating everything he did. Right before he logged off he gave me a big pile of gold.10/10 community."

I'm OK with people not liking something I like. What enjoyment a person derives from an experience and the qualities of that experience are largely subjective. That said, I'm not particularly tolerant of people blaming others for their own failings.Absolutely every single negative review for this game at the time of this posting without exception can be summarized as: the game is still in early development and I don't like that. I can't emphasize this enough, because absolutely every single negative review has been posted by someone willing to take the time to write something negative about a game in development but completely unwilling to learn about it before purchasing. The wall of blue text on the store page, the forums, the developers YouTube channel, Twitch, and lets not forget THE VERY REVIEW PAGE THEY ARE POSTING ON all inform you that the game is still more or less in alpha. So if you wish to make your purchasing decisions based on these knuckle dragging cretins, then here's your sign, you can skip the remainder of this review.The store page videos give you a good idea of the game experience the game is working towards. The key here is working towards, not at currently. Quite simply if you want to be part of the development of the game then I think you'll find it a rewarding experience. I have never seen devs as active and engaged as these. You can find them posting in the forums daily and every Friday they do a live stream Q&A session with the community. I think that's the key word there “community”. We're a community here working with the devs to make this game as good as possible. Now if you don't want to pay to be part of the testing and feedback phase of development, hey, that's perfectly fine. Check back every month or two and I think you'll eventually find a game in a state that you'll really enjoy.I could write quite a bit about this game but what I think I can say that is most relevant is that it is fun.  Perhaps that is an unsurprising statement from someone who has played it for 115 hours in two weeks time, but ultimately a fun game is what we're all chasing after. Clearly I have been having a good time. What I think makes it remarkable is there are many little things here that show it is made by people who are gamers like us. They have taken some of the best qualities from a variety of RPG games and made something unique yet kind of familiar. The action focus has been a rewarding departure from the more conventional RPG style which I have enjoyed very much, making it a more skill based game than you usually find with an RPG. It's not exactly an MMO but contains the better aspects of an MMORPG while lacking some of the pitfalls. All in all I think it's a very exciting experiment for an RPG that tips the hat to classics in a way that is endearing."
76561198009773217,Recommended,436560,23340648,"Posted: 2 June, 2016",all,wanderica,"Like some EA games, this one had a rocky first day, but after 3 days, I think I can give it an honest review.First, a little about the game for those of you that skipped straight to the reviews.  Kings and Heroes is a first person RPG that offers a blend of lobby based dungeon running and open world exploration.  Currently, the open world is there, but not populated with any content whatsoever, so that leaves us with a mostly functional dungeon crawl experience.Several gamebreaking bugs plagued this game on launch day, but the small dev team put out 2 patches within 24 hours of each other to address them.This is Early Access, so some remain, others will be discovered, and many more will be fixed as time goes by.  Currently, you can initially run dungeons ranging from small to huge on various difficulty settings from easy to nightmare.  Even small can take some time, especially solo, but largereallymeans large.  They can be massive on huge.  Difficulty ramps up considerably as you increase it.  I don't see anyone soloing nightmare before end-game with optimized gear.  Matchmaking for me has worked fine, but it seems the game tries to place you with players of the same level, so the lower levels can make it easier to just grind solo.  After level 10, though, grouping became much more enjoyable.  I have found the experience to be surprisingly social in dungeons.  Most of my groups have chatted away as we ground our way to the lower depths of dungeons.  Chat in the city is alive with people forming premade groups as well.  One complaint here is that it gets pretty repetitive at times, especially in the early levels before you've unlocked different locations to crawl through.Crafting offers a different game to those that have managed to figure it out.  It works, but is clearly unfinished as of now.  It is listed as ""independent of character level,"" but this is untrue.  Currently the skill levels (a max of 500) are not displayed, and are limited by your class level at 10 points per level.  Crafting itself works fine though.  Players can randomly obtain various qualities of crafted gear with a lower chance for purples and yellows.  I can see an end game situation where one would craft endlessly for that perfect item to round out a gear set.  To some this might be a turn-off.  Also there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of variation on stats.  With higher quality items, you get more stats on a piece, so crafting that high mitigation spell power plate is possible, but it cannot be customized.  It's all RNG.Overall, the experience offered in Kings and Heroes is fun, even if a little flawed due to early access.  Time will tell if this game turns in to the fully realized vision that Industry Games has for it, or if it will simply be another one of the many EA games on Steam that never really made it.  The potential is there, and there is open communication and passion from the devs.  I hope that someone reading this can see what I can from this very early access game: potential.Pros:Great dungeon crawler.Lots of loot to grab.Challenging at higher difficulties.Rewarding solo play if you can hack it.Meaningful crafting for those that enjoy it.Attentive and passionate dev teamSocial experience.Cons (many of these will be addressed as EA matures):Empty open world.Poor performance / optimization in places.Repetitive / Grindy.Little character customization outside of gear.RNG nature (from primary stats to crafting outcomes, everything is random)Numerous bugs."

For an EA game this one shows A LOT of promise.  The developers are very active and have provided regular updates.PROS SO FAR: Graphics are better than I expected; lots of loot that can be used for upgrades or for crafting; healers aren't a dead weight class and can actually heal and do some damage; good character customization options with the amount of loot and ability to change the colors of your gear; mounts to explore a large open world; fun with a party of friends.CONS SO FAR: Class balance still needs some adjusting; small population at least on the US server (I joined with some friends so not been a problem for me...so far); it has a large open world that looks good but is boring due to a lack of content (hopefully more will be added soon); dungeons get repetative;OVERALL: I like the game and will keep playing to see where the developers take it.*Gets on SoapBox*After actually reading the game description, reading several reviews, and finally playing the game. I have come to the conclusion that a lot of the reviewers do not understand what EA is:""Early access is a funding model in the video game industry by which consumers can pay for a game in the EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT and obtain access to INCOMPLETE, ALPHA OR BETA VERSIONS of the game, while the developer is able to USE THOSE FUNDS TO CONTINUE WORK ON THE GAME."" Which obviously most reviewers did not read this in the description so I doubt they will read it in my review.  So to anyone considering this game I would say keep in mind, IT IS NOT A COMPLETE GAME.This game is STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND NEEDS WORK, in its current state I recommend it as long as you understand what you are purchasing. So if you are looking for a COMPLETED game wait for the official release."

,Recommended,436560,25239984,"Posted: 29 August, 2016",all,Spykers,"I would recommend this game to people who like adventuring. Yes, this game is in a primitive state and has bugs. However, the foreseeable future of this game is quite bright, including the incoming addition of several PvP modes, new dungeons, improved itemization, and class reworks.Overall, Kings and Heroes is a mash-up of my favorite elements of traditional PnP adventures, MMORPGs, and action titles such as the Diablo series. You can set dungeons to various lengths to suit your needs, and crafting is in the game.New armor sets are being added, including PvP specific armor.Graphically the game takes a very traditional approach, dark, high fantasy, etc. High-end armor looks good, not cartoony or ridiculous in size. Enemies, such as skeletons, look mean and forboding, not like clunky bags of bones.I'm having a good time so far, despite issues -- and the game is happy if I only play 30 minutes. In just a few short hours, I've met some pretty nice people in game (who are also happy to answer questions if you are new to the game). I'll probably end up buyin a couple more copies for friends to see if they get into it too, and for $20, wth not."

I am currently max level in the game and there isn't a lot to do other than running dungeons and exploring an empty world. I really enjoyed my leveling experiance and everyone in the game is friendly enough. I really enjoy every aspect that is currently in the game and I would recommend it to anyone that doesn't mind a few road bumps while waiting for the good stuff to come.

I had to post this simply because all the negative 'reviews' are coming from impatient folks who decided to cast judgement a mere hour or so after the game entered early access. You simply *cant* honestly and truthfully review a game that soon or this soon in its lifespan. Yes its got latency issues, yes it got glitches, YES ITS IN EA.

But here we go.Kings and Heroes, a game that most of us could only hope and wish for. First Person Combat RPG, not like Vermintide but with depth to it. Think if Skyrim, Dungeons and Dragons, and Diablo had a baby. This would be that baby. It literally checked every single thing I wanted in a game.Launch day was a bit rough, insane lag, graphical glitches, input lag, game kinda still ran bad on my 980 and i7 5820k. Patch one was released no real fix, then patch two was released and actually got to do a dungeon with some friends. Holy god it was fun, there are still bugs, the game is unoptimized yes, but at its CORE, it is truly going to shape up to be a great game. And one I will continue playing. The devs are very very vocal, and seem like they are actually caring for their baby. Which is a breath of fresh air.I wont leave a review score right now, but I DO reccomend this game.

I can’t believe the amount of content and creativity it has and it is still in early access. Make sure you give this game 2-4 hours do not log in run around and leave disappointed, like I almost did, due to lack of guidance. Go to the Tavern sit at a table and solo a dungeon in easy mode. As you gain levels and knowledge of the game, try harder modes and grouping, it keeps getting better.

(though the latter rarely works because of a low player base)When designing a dungeon, you choose:1 Location2 Difficulty3 LengthNow it's up to you, to see how far you can go before you die. The deeper you get the tougher it gets, and greater rewards.But when you die, it's over and you can't go back!Depending on your difficult setting it can really get tough, and the content scale with your level, so the only thing that gives you an edge, is your skills and gear.Another key aspect in conquering difficult content is communication between players, and the game offers ingame voice for real time communication without any hassle.Since its an early access it's not a finished product, there is still some irritating bugs and alot of content missing, but what's there now, is pretty damn good. -  I have already sunken over 140 hours into it and counting.Noteworthy bugs/optimization:Load times - On a standard HD it will take 2-3 minutes to start up game. 30sec -1 min loading a dungeon.Random freezes - When entering a new dungeon level or sometimes just another part of the current level, the game freezes for a few seconds.0,5 second freezes - now and then the game will freezes for a split second, at any given time.Thats it, thats all the bugs and bad optimization that I encounter while playing.People that encounter dark dungeons, and low frame rate, must have some settings wrong, or not meeting the min. required hardware.I started playing this game on a Nvidia Gtx 660, which is the lowest recommended GFX card. And with all settings around the lowest possible, the game had none frame rate issues. It wasn't pretty, but my framerate was never under 30 fps.This game is pure quality and fun, and I predict a very bright future for this game.With all the nonsense and crappy games that the gaming culture has to endure these days, this game comes around with its old school quality, mixed with new age technology, making this supreme gameplay.- A much needed fu.king good game, that only getting better.! :)"

As it stands, the only thing I see avilable as far as content, is the dungeons. Do not get this game at the moment if you are looking for your next World of Warcraft AAA MMORPG. This is not that.This, from the character creation all the way to the environment and dungeons, reminds me of my tabletop gaming days. 5 or 6 classes, 5 or 6 races, base stats are calculated by dice (since it\'s on PC, obviously is going to be RNG and not actual dice), and race actually impacts your stats!In the games current state, there are plenty of graphical, UI, and AI bugs. But that didn\'t stop me from getting a group together to go do a dungeon. The AI and hit boxes need a little work. Thing that really sucks in dungeons is how narrow the corridors are, and allies can actually block your spells and ranged attacks. So 90% of the time I\'m just hitting my allies in the back of the head.Overall, I see a lot of potential in this game.

That just goes to show they're doing a lot to support the game. It's probably one of my most played steam games, and that says alot after all I have over 100+. I am not the kind of person that sticks with a game, but the dedication of the dev's means I'm dedicated to supporting them. Also honestly I'll continue to gift this game as much as I can, cause I've already had quite a few fun experiences with my groups in playing this."

The dungeons are well designed, graphics are top notch and the attitude from the developers is very refreshing. They definitely seem to be on top of things and are quite open to suggestions/feedback.In the end, if you're willing to put up w/ the bugs and new game blues, (like they all have in this phase of development) I'd say give it a go... my guild and I have been having a blast thus far."

Leveling up feels a bit shallow at times, and the towns can get a bit choppy with 20+ people all running around, but dungeoning with friends or by yourself is, in my opinion, a ton of fun.It has a good amount of variety in items, gear, dungeons, enemies, and the open world, while in my experience rather underpopulated, is massive and has a sense of eclectic beauty when the areas meld together. I only have about two hours into the game so far, and the pacing feels steady. Dungeons, at times, can be a breeze and then ramp up difficulty seemingly out of nowhere, which means you have to always be somewhat on your toes for what might be around the next corner or down the next cave.Overall, if you have been thinking about it, just try it.

The good news, is that you can now get Founder goodies in-game that give you 20% XP increase.  You don't want to miss out on that.  So, if you don't absolutely NEED your Princess Crown, this is still a great buy.In the past year, everything has improved.  The devs have been very busy and the game is smoothing out beautifully.  Having missed almost all of the past year, I returned to the game to find combat more fun, dungeons better balanced, crafting improved and the overworld enabled.  That's a lot of work put into the game.The world is beautifully rendered.  Dungeons provide the basic leveling experience, with different kinds becoming available as you level up.  Dungeons also provide your only source of gold and main source of crafting materials, either as drops or by salvaging equipment found.Crafting is a key part of the game, with an RNG that can crit your crafted items at any crafting level to any rarity of dropped gear in the game.If you enjoy dungeon crawling, breaking and smashing everything in sight, challenging dungeon boss fights and carrying the loot home for after battle crafting, this may just be your game."

Kings and Heroes has lots of subtle charm and has an old-school RPG feel somewhere in a game that has little more to offer than a random dungeon generator and a friendly,  growing community.Game design lies somewhere between a top-down DnD action-Rpg and WoW... There are hints of humor in its current build that I hope are expanded in coming updates. The MMO feel is almost there, however, until more world content arrives (promised soon) it feels very MOBA-esque as queueing for dungeons and a few crafting professions comprise game-play.If the promise of an old-school RPG feel and a growing MMO community bring enticement then this is a great game to support while game-play elements are fleshed out and brought online. If you need more than just a succulent taste then wait for more from the developers.For what it's worth,  my first game-play experience lasted more than 12 hours and this is the only game I've ever reviewed on Steam...Cheers!"

I've been having some real fun with the dungeons and the combat. I've done several Solo dungeons (none completed successfully but almost), and 1 grouped dungeon (also not successfully) but it was a lot of fun. I love the way you can build a dungeon based on how big you want it, and the deeper you get into the dungeon the better the loot apparently. The biggest dungeon i've done so far is a large, and I honestly have not had the desire to play a game so much in a long time.I wanted to write the review because the game intrigued me and I was interested, but I almost did not get it because of the negative reviews, and the biggest flaw I read about was the constant crashing. While playing for my little stint of 2.5 hours or so, I did not crash once. See my EDIT below, I do crash now but not nearly as much as people say.I have not really ventured out into the ""Open world"" so I don't know how good that is but the random generated dungeons are very fun so far, the traps, the hidden walls, the fear of opening a door and having 4 mobs in your face that you have to deal with is pretty scary but damn good fun... and if you don't like that kind of thing, you can always just do a cavern style dungeon where there are no doors, and you can see the mobs, but to me that isn't nearly as fun.EDIT: I have been playing longer now, and I have experienced the crashes, but for me right now it's about 2 per day. I can play for hours with no crashes. I'm still having fun with the dungeons. I did venture out into the open world for a few minutes, but I didn't see a lot so i'm assuming they are working on that. Regardless of the issues, the game is well worth it if you would love to play a game that feels like Diablo in the first person (which I love)."

If you are one of those poeple who doesn't like paying for a game that isn't ready to be released don't buy it. This game in it's current state would be considered crossing from alpha to beta stages. If you want first person world of warcraft with hit targeting, unlimited mana and endless dungeons with your friends, this game is perfect for you.If you like the idea of having a company other than blizz who hasn't sold you out to in game purchases, think of it as a kickstarter fund, while knowing that it's a small contribution to a game company that is actually trying to make a game you want to play. Even if you don't play it because the game is in early days, follow the game, get notified when a new patch comes out and give it a shot then. If this game goes under it will be soley because the fact, the steam community gives negative reviews on early access games based intirely on their stage of development, rather than gameplay, or even potential.

If you are unhappy spending money on a product that is not finished, can crash, has bugs, etc - do not buy this game.That said, I'm having an absolute blast.  The game supports solo play, and co-op up to 8 players.  5 Classes and multiple races to choose from, and multiple character slots available allow for a lot of variability in play.  Each class does play fairly distinct from the others and are legitimate on their own.Crafting is not fully implemented, but what is there is functional at a base level.  This is one of the areas I'm most excited for, but if you are buying this with crafting being a primary factor, be aware it is not yet complete!I have played both solo and with groups.  Both are a ton of fun, though get enough wizards together and your screen will be so full of color that you may lose sight of the enemy.  Towns are MMO style, with up to 250 players (I think? I could be wrong there) capable of being present.  Global voice-chat is enabled, and some people's microphones are WAY louder than others.  Hopefully there will be a way to handle this in the future.I've crashed a couple times, but overal it's been pretty solid for an Early Access experience.  Loading can take quite awhile (especially when you launch the game initially), so just be aware of that.Classic ARPG dungeon delving, grouping, looting, crafting, leveling, buying/selling and skill purchasing are all present to varying degrees of completion.To sum up - I'm having a blast.  If you enjoy watching games progress from unstable, feature incomplete but fun games into fully fledged products, then do pick this up and support the developers.  If you need a finished product to justify the cost of your money, feel free to wait for it to be further along or released before purchase as there is definitely a way to go for some features and stability."

Why is it that most of us miss the good ol' days of playing an MMORPG, what happened to the mmo's like before. Well the true answer that I believe is that most games are not as social as they were before.This game, I started out by myself not knowing anyone and thinking at launch, I should just refund my money because of the server lag issues and that it took forever for me to even load the game up from launch. Maybe this game was bunk. But! I knew this was early access and I decided to wait it out. Well....I am glad that I did. The game has proximity voice chat. I really like that!

So the devs gotta get those numbers up somehow.https://steamdb.info/app/436560/graphs/-Soloing is a little boring for me because I play support classes.-Its very action based, hack and slash to the max. With good impact to the hits.-Classes and races feel unique, but aside from a few exclusives you seem to be able to use whatever weapons and armour you like.-the Graphics are detailed and stylish, with a slightly cartoon flair. But not so much that the gear looks flat, the art direction found a great middle ground.-The quests seem a bit confusing and buggy right now. With no option to abandon a quest if things aren't working right-If the inspiration for the overall UI and HUD layout was MMO, then please give me scale ability and freedom to set up the hud as I desire, size, shape, opacity. All this should be adjustable.-Also let me adjust or toggle the loot highlighting, a fade in or range is needed on that. Some may not mind the outline, but I need something more subtle.-The in game voip is weak.-The in game models and clutter is very well laid out, the world does feel ""lived in"" in spite of the lack of roaming npc / town folk.Overall i'm pleased with my purchase, I hope to see this game reach completion."

,Recommended,436560,26650328,"Posted: 17 November, 2016",all,Zalbraxes,"Kinda big reviewFor those who dislike big texts:- Yes, I recommend this game right now IF you are well aware that its an Early Access (and everything that this implies)- Game is good to play alone (or by making groups on the go), but its best served with a group of friends- Last few lines of the review have a tl;dr version/recommendation; I encourage you read that at least1: The Crystal Ball (Character Creation)Pretty. This is something that you can see very well in the screenshots, sure, but its still noteworthy; the textures are well made, the models are good, and the spell effects are neat, albeit simple. The character creation is nice, with a fortune teller guiding you through the whole process, giving a few lore descriptions to races and classes, and the description on which attribute does what is pretty clean and objective. The first negative point being right here: you MUST roll your attributes, until you find something that doesnt outright suck (values go from 3 to 18, and you can get an all <10 roll), or that fits your class well (because you might end up with an 18 Str Mage). Its funny because the fortune teller complains every now and then if you reroll too many times, but this should (and hopefully, will) be changed into a point-buy system.Customization is, as of now, a bit limited, although the few choices you have do make a difference. I suppose they might expand this area, but Im not holding my breath here.2: Everdale Village (Entering the Game)We now hit the second problem: the lack of a tutorial. The game greets you with a letter to tell you where to find the things youll need in the village, but thats about how much guidance youll receive; be it combat or crafting, youll need to find things out for yourself, which may leave some features in the shadows (ie: to run solo, choose Create Dungeon instead of Random Dungeon; the former does not queue you on matchmaking, it seems). The commands are, in general, well mapped, but may require some use to really get them, and you may end up using things you dont want to (blocking is defaulted to F, while interacting/talking is defaulted to G). The map, on the other hand, is quite useful, and makes finding what you need even easier.3: Exploring (Game Features)The main objective of the game is, clearly, to scratch the murderhobo itch that all RPers have: you enter a dungeon, kill stuff, pillage their corpses and chests (the wooden ones), then you get out and sell or salvage your loot to get even better equipment to do all over again, but on harder stuff to kill. No mystery here. It may get boring eventually, but this is a game best enjoyed with a few friends anyways. Bonus points that, to get into the dungeons, you have to sit on a tavern table to get your job from an NPC (tables that dont have NPCs work too). As I said before, on the dungeon interface, you have two options: Random Dungeon matches you with other players, and you can run stuff together, and Create Dungeon allows you to choose how hard and where exactly you want your run to be, without the matchmaking part, which allows for solo and closed party runs.There is also a PvP Zone, which I havent tested yet, which uses the same table interface to take you to its options, which include Capture the Flag.You can also pick a crafting skill from some NPCs, which are scattered all around the village. All you gotta do is talk to the Master <Profession> NPCs, and theyll ask you if you wanna learn it. Remember you can pick only one, and trying to pick a second one will clearly state that youll lose all progress on the one you had. To craft, you apparently have to stand real close to the Salvage NPC, even though the game says you need a crafting station (which would lead you into the NPCs home to look for it).The Class NPCs are used to advance your class; with them, you buy new skills, or upgrade the ones you already had.Speaking of Skills, some of them (but not all, apparently) require that you have certain weapons equipped, like the Champion's Bash, which use the shield.Also of note, you can buy a horse, and even a pet demon that acts as a bank/vendor. Both are cheap, most likely because of the testing period right now.Outside of Everdale, there is a HUGE map to explore, although my recent adventure yielded nothing, and I suppose this is something that will be added after the base experience is well adjusted and more stable.4: TechFirst of all, I just want to remind you that its an Early Access, and Im just adding this part to the review so that you can decide wether or not you can deal with some of its problems. So far, the only big ones Ive found are that sometimes, items may fall through the ground; it IS not optimized yet, which probably will cause heavy stuttering unless your machine is way over the top; and the outside of Everdale has a few places that may trap you, requiring that you use the (already provided at start) teleporting stone. Combat works fine, although skills may sometimes not cast (mainly because you must be still to use them; attacking or walking blocks their use), and interacting with some objects mat require a double click to work.---5: Summary and tl;drI wholeheartedly think that this game is fine and fully enjoyable as of now, and advise any RPG lover to buy it. As a tabletop RPer, it did a very good job to sate my need for a fix, even though its not the same (and doesnt intend to).However, if you arent patient, are prone to nitpicking, or if youre simply suspicious of Early Access (no judgement here, its a healthy stance nowadays), hold your money, but do follow this game, because I think it has great potential."

But for example bow draws too fast, smite on cleric is too spamable, its like its trying to hard to be action based but sells the beauty and journey of the game short in the process.I think combat should be more deliberate.  Also every mob is a loot pinata, literally they drop like everything they wear, but you cant pick and choose what to take, so you click on a mob and your bag fills up with gear automagically,  Havent figured out how to delete items from by bags without selling or salvage.  BAsically inventory management needs work.I also think you move too fast when moving and sprinting feels like cheat mode.  Also mobs move too fast as well in dungeons.  There just isnt enough room to move around with the speed that everything moves at, in my opinion.  It feels unnatural.I would have less gear drops and more meaningfull gear drops because of it.  Again that part of the game feels forced too, like its trying to do too much too soon.Graphics are nice, but capped at I Think 60  FPS unless you edit an .ini file to set it manually.  Spell effects for a first person game are retina burning but I guess they are working on.Bottom line this is a fantastic foundation for a game, they just need to balance and make adjustments to game play.

You aren't pressured to join groups and the tools for joining one are simple and easy to use.Gameplay Video 4 - Human Wizard Spider Crypt Run (No Commentary)Going solo again, this time as a much more powerful wizard. With a lot of different abilities at my disposal, targetting those fast spiders is much less painful.

Read the note and Press ""M"" to see the map and find the place.There isn't much outside of town.  Head to the tavern and grab a seat to find a dungeon or start your own.Read the forums and ask questions in game.  Lots of helpful folk out there.The crafting system is simple.  You get one tradeskill (but can change it any time at the cost of resetting the current one) and it's simply a matter of re-crafting the piece you want over and over until you get one with the stats you like.Visit the red imp just outside the Tavern.  He sells some items that will definitely help you out.If you're wondering what some of the issues are:The game will crash on occassion.  I experienced it every four or five times I changed zones.It's not optimized.  Melee and raned combat is tough because you can't lock on to your target - you have to aim to hit them.  With the delay between pressing attack and actually attacking, you'll miss a lot (as shown in the videos).  NPC interaction is clunky because of this as well, and expect to rubber-band around the dungeon a few times.It's a grind-fest right now.  I expect this will change as content is added, but you can get to level 50, and you can do it solo or with a party.You have to be VERY close to an object to loot it or talk to it (as shown in the videos).  Like nearly standing on top of it.In Summary:If you want a polished game with tons of content, wait for this one.  If you want great graphics and a fun group-friendly game with friends (and dont mind the issues), give this a shot."

That being said it needs major optimizations i even added -USEALLAVAILABLECORES for launch options and i still could hardly move other then that it looks great. Oh the bench glitch needs to be looked at when you sit you get stuck. I will be back to play when more optimization are implamented.

K&H also includes some MMO elements such as a town hub and seasonal special events, such as a fireworks vendor for the 4th of July.Pretty good for EA but needs a lot of work until full release, mainly optimization, combat improvement, and major AI improvement needed. I'm looking forward to PVP and the world map to come to life, which are coming soon...In its current state, I highly suggest K&H to fans of D&D and M&M or those who want to play a dungeon crawler (with or without friends) in a first person view.

I'll update my review in a few days.Now that I've gotten a full dungeon in, I feel like I can fully review the game now. (Might put serious review at bottom)This game is a pretty good Mystery Point & Click Adventure.The local baddies have taken all of the stairs and hidden them in their lair.The dwarf at the local tavern tasked me to go and find where all of the stairs have been hidden. So I grab my friend and we head to the crypt to solve this mystery. We were met with 3 hallways upon entering the insidious hideout. There were a lot of baddies that we had to click on to get rid of them, because they were hindering our search for the mysterious staircases. Eventually we'd found at least 6 staircases. At this point there were so many enemies in the hallway that we had to click on, I almost thought we were playing a dungeon crawler or something. But that wouldn't stop us from solving the mystery and finding the final staircase. But boy let me tell you, that final staircase was very well hidden. There was a door we had to interact with by pressing a button rather than clicking on it to open it, and alas the final door was inside. Upon finding the final staircase, we went down to find out who had been stealing staircases. There was a very unpleasant skeleton that we had to click on a few times before he gave in and told us he would never steal another staircase again.With all of the staircases returned to the village and the very obnoxious skeleton restored to a regular skeleton, everyone lived happily ever after.In all seriousness, this game is almost like a first person Diablo style game. With a DnD theme. The game has pretty poor performance, though my computer needs a new CPU really bad. The devs constantly update this game getting rid of crash bugs and improving the game. I have to give a huge hand to the devs. They're handling this game very well.As for the game itself, everything dies pretty fast from what I've been able to see so far, including yourself. Which is enjoyable. Everything feels dangerous. That being said I'm low level and have only played on easy. It wast still a very fun experience. the dungeon itself was pretty long and it got harder the further down we went. I could see this game being insanely fun with a full party on a high difficulty. As of the 2 man short easy dungeon, it was enjoyable but I cant really give you too much info off of playing on just that."

The randomly generated dungeons will give you many hours of entertainement, and the combat system is really addictive. Compared to many other games in Early Access on Steam it's doing great - there's not any game breaking bugs, and the developers seems to patch the game quite often. As of now there's just PvE and crafting in the game, but eventually there will be PvP as well. There's much for the developers to do before the full release of the game, but for me it's already worth playing. I don't think Kings and Heroes is going to be the next ""big MMO"", but I know for sure it's going to provide me hundreds of hours of entertainment."
,Recommended,436560,26733577,"Posted: 21 November, 2016",all,MattyEhh,"I've been playing this game for long enough I feel I can give a decent recommendation.Kings and Heroes scratches a very specific itch when it comes to dungeon crawling and loot that only a few ARPG type games can do, but Kings and Heroes is more than that.The game is attempting to be an MMO type where you can group up with as many as 8 players to tackle dungeons at one time with loot distribution in a round robin function.  The majority of the equipment you'll find won't be an upgrade, but it can be broken down or sold to work towards crafting that perfect piece of gear you need.Early Access in Kings and Heroes will see you disconnect / crash from the game here and there, but it doesn't take long to get back into the action.  Not all crafting materials / plans are implemented, but what is there is enough to get you started in the world.  There isn't any story to be had yet, but the devs do a weekly chat on twitch where you can keep up with what is in the pipeline.Can't wait to update this recommendation."

,Recommended,436560,24023925,"Posted: 2 July, 2016",all,Raeshlavik,"Kings and Heroes is pretty good for early access.What this is in it's current state is a late 80's D&D simulator... Back when you would get 5-6 people together on a weekend, but no one wanted to be the GM - so you'd whip up a random dungeon and go lay waste to it.No complicated storyline or quests or NPCs to fiddle with... Just brute-force dungeon crawling for the sake of EXP and loot.That's Kings and Heroes in a nut shell - right now. Things will undoubtedly change as development progresses.The graphics are pretty enough, with something of a cartoony flair (not a bad thing). The combat is fluid enough to keep things twitchy for the Leeeroy Jeeeenkins players out there, but still provide challenge for us tactical folks who peek around corners.Over the last hour and a half I've played two dungeons - both on the 'small' size setting and the 'easy' difficulty. The first was a crypt and the second a sprawling cave complex. Both were well rendered and provided plenty of tense doors and corners. :)In both cases I made it to the final ""Boss"" and got roflstomped, but that's okay as I got to keep all of the loot I picked up getting there - so I'm happy.All in all, I need to get some of my friends playing as the game supports up to 8 players in a party.

There is truly SO much potential here. Kings and Heores is a Diablo-style dungeon grinding game with lots of unique traits that really creates a refreshing experience. This game has a very nostalgic feel to it, yet it\'s unlike anything I\'ve ever played before.The game features a huge overworld with varied landscapes and regions. It currently is explorable but not entirely populated, but it shows much promise. From giant icy castles on mountain tops, to muddy swamps, this game truly has it all. It invokes a sense of adventure I haven\'t felt in a game since I first played WoW 10 years ago. Currently there can be up to 250 players in the overworld and devs are looking to increase that. Quests and other things to do in the world are soon coming as well.The combat is very satisfying, it feels very similar to that of Dark Messiah. Accuracy matters, there is no auto-targetting. If you get head shots, you will do more damage than blindly firing off arrows and spells. Death actually feels like it\'s meaningful too. If you die, that\'s it for the dungeon you\'re in. You can be revived by a scroll or a Cleric, but if your team wipes you don\'t get another shot.Dungeons are surprisingly fun. I intially feared that playing with 8 people in first person might cause too much clutter and confusion but it actually works quite well. The dungeons currently have some basic traps, and devs say that secret passages and such are on the way soon. It\'s really great gathering a big party of friends and just dungeon crawl, there aren\'t many opportunities to do that these days.There\'s a surprising amount of content for the game as it\'s still EA. Most of the core features work and are available. The devs seem very dedicated, they have been working day and night to pump out patches it seems. That being said, there are certainly some cons. There\'s a huge number of bugs, and the performance is not the best. I hear AMD GPU users are having some issues with artifacting and spell details on weapons. If you don\'t have a somewhat decent PC, I would hold out until there\'s some more optimization. I have a 970 though and the game is playable for me with lag only in congested areas.I will continute to update this review as things come along, but I would definitely recommend this if you\'re a fan of dungeons, looting and just having some adventures with friends."

You have to put up with some lag and framerate issues but again, it's early access. Each class has it's own special feature - archer gets a hookshot thing - rogue can run up walls - not sure about the others yet - pretty cool but it's not very practical aside from dodgine some traps - still kinda fun to swing around town though.The graphics are decent, They are not super realistic but they still look nice.The dungeon crawling is really the main thing you can do right now, and it is very fun. the random dungeons mix things up and you can scale the size and difficulty.Things that I would like to see:- Quests (I know they are coming eventually)- Exploring to be an option for getting some xp, something a little different from the dungeon crawling. -I did try some exploring and walked about 10 minutes outside, saw a bear and half a dozen bees sitting there, then game crashed - reloaded - walked for about 5 more minutes - got owned by a wolf - 10/10- Trading (turns out this is already in the game, I just didn't know!)- More NPCs around townThings that Bothered me:- As a rogue, the stealth skill causes every boss to instantly heal back to full health.This makes solo boss runs much more difficult and undermines the entire point of being a rogue. I am sure with a party this wouldn't happen but I like running around as a rogue and being able to stealth about.Other than that everything else is fine, just a couple issues but they can all be chalked up to early access flaws.I would definately recommend this to anyone looking for a fun game to pass the time."

Found a few groups to tackled the hardest dungeon on the hardest setting, which I couldn't do on my own solo yet.It doesn't require an exhaustive amount of time to learn the basics, how to get around and have run.  First dungeon the first time is hard.  And there aren't instructions... except when you shout out questions in local chat.

Even though sometimes the game gets a little bit laggy, it's still nice.I would prefer to have a little bit more of a free hand during character creation, especially over attributes (which are purely random generated) and sometimes it can get pretty frustrating if you are creating - let's say ranger - and your dexterity is not even 10 and you can not get the 16-18 roll and even if you get it, than all your stats are under 10. I had a similar situation with my cleric when I rolled everything over 14 but my wisdom and intelligence which ended up being deep under 10.It's nice that all of the classes have their place in a party - Mages can for example be your torch so you don't have to waste your stats on wielding a torch even in the darkest dungeons.Crafting system is present in the game, altough it can be pretty frustrating to find the master craftsman/woman you want to become apprentice of.You can also colour your equipment if you wish to do so, altough for a price.All in all I would recommend you to try out this game and see for yourself if it's worth your support or not."
,Recommended,436560,26707162,"Posted: 19 November, 2016",all,lenkek,"7/10 as of 11/19/2016DISCLAIMERThis game has a lot of bugs, and its not quite polished yet with new content coming in still.I do not include my opinion and experience on this review of PvP,  matchmaking (for dungeons), storyline, mobs, classes, UI, NPCs, and questing.-MY THOUGHTSAs I bought this game for $10, I think its worth my $10. I've played this game for 9.7 hours (playtime of posting this review) and I can tell that this game is not perfect.MY THOUGHTS ON DUNGEONSThe dungeon system is fair, for solo players, you're going to mostly playing on normal or easy difficulty. On easy and normal, everything seems good for a solo player. With a team of players, you'll be able to have more fun, and be able to go through these dungeons easily. I believe this game is great with friends and a group. Dungeons might be hard for new people who have just bought the game if they put it on normal. So I suggest going into easy mode at the beggining when you play.MY OPINION ON DUNGEONSIt also makes me play more, since I get really far into these dungeons, although some people might find it repetitive (going through the same modeled levels 5 times, and getting to a new modeled level and going through that again also 5 times, etc.). But what really makes me play this game, is by getting good loot from these dungeons, and leveling up to level 50 in these dungeons. If you don't have a goal  in this game, it will be repetitive for you for sure, unless you just play to pass and waste time.CRAFTING AND MY OPINIONCrafting scales with your level, the max craft level is 500, and the max character level as I have seen is level 50. So you would have to depend on your character's level to craft instead of your crafting level to craft stuff that you want. So this game is pretty linear and static in terms of gear progression other than RNG loot. We have armorsmithing, weaponsmithing, alchemy, leathersmith, and tailor. The other con about crafting is that you can't mutliclass crafting, if you do wish to switch to another craft, you would lose all the progression you made on that craft.MY OPINION ON THE COMBAT SYSTEMI love the combat system. It's on par as an ""action"" MMORPG in my opinion. Mostly every ability is aimed by your mouse which is quite skilled, and every skill is casted from hotkeys, and kind of more challenging to me. And a plus for me is that its in first person! If you're not good with aiming, I suggest that you play as a Champion (melee warrior).MY THOUGHTS OF THE OPEN WORLDCurrently as of the date I post this review, there is not much in the open world outside of the starter town. Most of the mobs are high level (level ~20), and nobody has really explored it. There's not that much to do there, and I'm pretty sure that the developers will work on that in the future, as of the current point of the game is the dungeoning.MY THOUGHTS ON GRAPHICSThe graphics look good, I honestly thought it was going to look like a mobile game when I first saw it when scrolling down on Steam. Made with the Unreal Engine 4, this game sure does look good. Nothing there to complain about, other than if you have a weak system, then you might not run this game well on the highest settings at 60fps.TL:DR - This game is better with a group. Dungeons could become repetitive for some, if you don't have a goal. Crafting is linear, you can't have multiple crafts at once. Combat is more action, and most attacks are aimed with your mouse. The open world in this game feels empty.  Game needs more polishing (the devs are working on that), and I overall rate this a 7/10 personally."

A lot of the other reviews have criticized the lag and fatal errors.  Those still exist, although the developers are responsive, active on the boards to understand the issues and seemed to have fixed a number of those (most??) in the last couple of weeks.  But I expected the game to still have some issues because it is EA.Those issues aside, it is exactly what I hoped for... a first-person fantasy game that I can play with friends online.  FPS makes this different from other games that I've played.  The first few levels are HARD to solo.  But once you get the hang of it and a few gear items, it gets better... like most games.Where the game shines is in a group.  It is face-paced romp through up to 15-20 levels of dungeons with the ability to pick your difficulty level.   It is MUCH better if you know a person or two to play with...There is an overworld, but there isn't much in it yet.

Kings and Heroes, even in this Early State offers sooo much! This is a pretty ambitious title, the world is massive, and its going to be a blast watching it get filled in as development progresses. Yes its Early Access, Yes a lot of basic comfort functions are missing ...1) Map Icons (Trainer, Crafter Location Markers)2) Tutorial3) Clear Story Path4) Is there a story? Doesn't matter. Your an adventurer, go get loot and dungeon crawl.There is obviously a lot of work still to do, but what is currently available to the player is a very expansive play area, fun combat, easy grouping and (so far) a very friendly and helpful community. Some people claim combat was a little easy for them, I would advise them to change the difficulty at the start of their dungeon.My (rather lengthy) first review is below if anyone is interested in first impressions, nothing has really changed my mind on what I said before, only now Im pretty damn addicted to the game.The only real hate I have, the only REAL annoyance, is Stat Rolling for Character Creation. This was a practice used in a lot of old school RPG's for PC, a practice abandoned for good reason I think. I can hit ""Re-Roll"" on my starting stats until I have a set of 18, 17 and 16's on every Stat. Cool as that may sound, you have to Re-Roll A LOT! I mean I've played ... I think 10 hours at the time of my writing this and Id say an hour and a half of that has been boring Stat Re Rolls. DO NOT let this discourage your getting into the game! Once you have your desired stats the game play itself more then makes up for the time spent slinging dice.So, if you want a FPV Dungeon Crawl with Random Generated Massive Maps, Beautiful Graphics, Fun Combat and (so far) a Good Community of players, give this a go. Help the Devs with Feedback during Early Access so this game can grow into the massive and amazing RPG they are crafting. I'm going to grab a drink, then log back in, cheers.****(ORIGINAL REVIEW, FIRST IMPRESSIONS)****This game is very Early Access, with that being said, its also a lot of fun. I'm seeing some hate going around but people really need to keep in mind that this game is still in the development process, your going to have bugs, your going to be missing basic comforts.The game itself is very pretty, but you kinda expect that with U4. Controls are simple enough, if you have ever played an Elder Scrolls game for more then 5 minutes, you have the general idea of how to attack and move.As of right now, there is no tutorial, you kinda run blind out the gate, BUT from the short time I have played (and I do plan on playing a lot more) the in game community is pretty friendly. Most people I ran into were more then happy to give me the run down on where to go to get quests, sale gear and get into my first dungeon. The community right now is a very big plus, a good community, especially with a game that is still being developed is a major plus with keeping new players around. In my humble opinion.The game is very solo friendly. If you go in with a group, it adjusts itself to fit. The only real issue I had at the beginning was rolling Stats? Come on guys, neat idea, but trying to create a Warrior and I rolled 17 on Int 12 x in a row lol. So, that part I don't really see as a necessity. The game takes a while to load, like go grab a drink and bowl of chips then come back loading times, BUT once its done and you get into your dungeon (which are different every time you play) you see why. MASSIVE lol. First dungeon, starting quest, was just so expansive, the vast majority of my time in game was running around my first dungeon, I don't think I even explored the whole area before finishing out. Just massive.Combat is good, some very, very slight delays on some attacks, randomly, enough to notice but never got me killed, the only real delay was in breaking barrels. My weapon connected, they looked at me, then fell apart so I could loot the contents. Not a real deal breaker by any means."

The game looked insanely fun and addictive.  I DL'd the game and started it up and was met with a long load in screen.  WIth no end in sight to the load in screen, I restarted the game and was met with the same thing.  The first two hours was me, sitting here at my comp, and waiting for it to load.  SO I did a little research on the community page and saw that it was that very weekend that they had a huge server upgrade and merger.So this factored in on a heafty decision about the game, do I get a refund?Thankfully my brain was working properly and knowing that this game is in the ""testing phase"", I did not make that rash judgement of a refund.  Even though all weekend long I tried logging in.  This game is in beta.  It's in the early stages.  The devs are looking for feedback on this game.  They want to know this stuff about the game so they can fix it and make it an enjoyable experience for everyone.Fast forward to Monday, I was ready to retry logging in...OMG IT WORKED!  So I was able to create a couple characters and here is my first thoughts about this game :It's a really fun and exciting game.  I took my goblin wizard around the town area and looked at the vendors and then sauntered into the tavern.  There I was met with tables to sit at.  Once sitting I was able to load up a dungeon.  Oh man it was fun.  This game has a lot of potential!  From fighting my first boss, a giant bear to exploring and gaining loot, this was a fun experience and I had a great time.  The graphics are decent and I know things will be polished more as the devs continue to add content and fix bugs.Note to all who have played dungeon crawling games or MMO's :When you die in the dungeon, you cannot return but you are then scuttled away to a graveyard and then returned to town.  It's a rogue-like dungeon and you keep the loot that you gained before you died.Hope this helps!  I know I will continue to play and look forward to the content."

I would highly recommend this game for individuals who are ok with early access issues like performance and multiple bugs in the game, but want to pay the game early and watch it grow and develop.Currently, I am playing this game with another friend and it is a blast to run dungeons together. Playing the game solo is difficult atm, as you would need to be a class that as some kind of a heal, or just be a god like player that I am not. There is a group finder in place, in a very early stage to help with this. You can also just post in the ingame chat that you are looking for a group.As a healer main in other mmo's, playing a healer in first person is jsut a blast. It can be very stressful keeping a party up when they can run out of view, but that makes it fun. Healing is no longer just staring at health bars and clicking a healing ability. Now, sometimes a heal doesnt go off if you think you are aiming at an ally but you miss their hitbox.

Here's my pros and cons.Pros:*The party system is amazing. You have to sit in a PUB to open the party menu. The immersion is very appealing in this aspect.*Different classes with unique abilities. I have played the rogue so far, and I can climb walls! Does not work very well to try and avoid traps it seems. Maybe I will get it down. As far as I know, Clerics can fly, Champions can double jump, other classes different unique utilities.*First-person dungeon crawl with action. The feeling this game gave me was Dungeons and Dragons and Skyrim meeting in the middle. It is a really cool concept.*The environment of the game is cartoony but it is vibrant and has it's own distinct feel. So-to-say that it is original, and a good medieval feeling.*Secret rooms in dungeons, a chance at another boss to fight or loot.*Traps, yes traps makes dungeons even more fun. Because there are more obsticles to overcome, rather than a find-and-kill rince-and-repeat style.Cons:Combat, oh boy... I really want to love this game.*Hit-boxes are poorly done. I am not sure if it registers or if I am not hitting the monster hit-boxes. The game is fast-pace action, but it is hard to enjoy yourself when you have to make sure to play the mechanics to register a hit.*Dungeons are a bit dull. They have around 5-20 floors as I was told. It takes about 30 minutes to complete a dungeon that's basically rince-and-repeat. Bosses are interesting, but I have only fought two so far. They seem to be re-skined mobs with higher stats.*Mobs are just stand-in-place monsters to fight. Nothing unique besides their types. I believe in order to them to strive for a unique and new style, for dungeon crawl is to make AI that does something they would do in real life and be alerted of enemies. Again, nothing special about mobs to make a player immersed. Especially when you're running through 5+ floors. It gets dull.I would definitely play this game in release. It has a lot of good concepts, but combat is about 75% of the game. I don't want to play something that annoys me, so I will try and support the devs."

I picked it up on sale during the Steam Winter Sale because it appeals to my favorite kind of games:  Medieval fantasy.  I also gravitate to small co-op RPGs.  They're (shockingly) rare.We all take a risk when we support any Early Access project and I am definitely someone who tries to avoid them.  I'm glad I didn't this time.  K&H has great potential.  The developers seem passionate and hopefully aggressive about their project.  I dont want to be let down because I'm really enjoying K&H.  There are I think some unfair critiques of the game on Steam.  Judging the games performance and framerate is just silly at this point.  It is an EA project and clearly not optimized.I consider myself a good judge of character.  As it may apply to picking a winning person or in this case a game and company.  I think I've done well.

In it's current state it still offers a lot of fun and enjoyment.The devs are friendly and communicate frequently with their fans. The current player base seems to die hard fan boys, but that's actually a good thing! The players are friendly and WANT the game and community to thrive.This plays like a modern dungeon crawler, but with a loot grab like a lot of ARPG's. Currently there are no quests, which sometimes feels unpleasant, but the REAL focus is delving dungeons, slaying monsters, progressing your hero, and grabbing LEWT to get stronger! You'll find traps, and bosses, treasure chests, and puzzles. There is a town that currently serves as a central HUB world. The town is home to several NPC's that sell you materials for crafting, and teach you various crafting skills. You can craft your own gear, but the best gear comes from slaying bosses in the hardest dungeons!There is a very large overworld that is currently almost empty, however, the devs have mentioned BIG plans for this game!It's incomplete as it stands, but it's worth a grab for what it has to offer now, and what is has to offer in the coming future!"

And the character creation is very very limited.As said 15 minutes but then I need to stop - WHY?!Lemme tell you: I have a PC Mustard Race PC. For the common gamer just said, my build is really new, shiny and works really neat. No details here, this is for the common dude to read.I got a security system that tells me (very fudging loudly) when my system is going to be overheated. Aka when it its 60°C.Now after 15 Minutes of playing this game, my system goes from 42°C up to 60°C which is really really weird.The only way I can explain this to me is that something was done horribly wrong when compiling the game.As I'm not even advanced level in game development I can't tell you if it's the recompiling or the decompiling process. (Google might help for that not to understand, this is a review not a tutorial to game development ;) )So yes this game needs work but OFCOURSE IT NEEDS WORK, because it is EARLY ACCESS. So everyone complaining about bugs - IT'S WORK-IN-PROGRESS.After all, this game is neat, has great potential and I'd give even more money for such a game. But that's just my opinion tbh.

But it seems to me the design of first person dungeon crawl with some character customizations is exactly what I've wanted, so I was willing to give it a try when it has been in early access state for almost half a year.To sum up my in-game experience: after some decent character creation with nice looking art assets, nothing in the actual game works. NOTHING! I was first treated with the option to pick a region from US or EU, which means explicitly this game is perma online. What's the point of having a Diablo-like game with online data exclusive? Whatever, but when I selected ""US"" it went out there to ask me again if I would like to pick ""US"". Nice UI design principle indeed! Then, it starts to load--presumably trying to contact server, and this went on for 10 minutes before the client lost response so I had to restart. The second attempt to connect to the server was smooth enough, except that the game had to ask me to double check AGAIN if I was willing to play in the US!Now that I'm logged on to the server, everything showed up in the lowest possibly details as if I was playing Quake 1 in 1996, my client again froze 20 seconds to load higher spec textures/meshes. Note this is on GTX 980 TI and i7 5820K and 16G RAM. So far so good. The game defaulted res to 1080p, and when I changed to 4k res all hell broke loose, and the UI completely went nuts all buttons are overlapping with each other and blocking the actual options. When I set it to fullscreen, guess what? ""Fatal Error"" CTD. It also messed up my desktop so I had to restart my Windows. Nice job!From there I tried 4 more times booting up the game, and it ended up ""fatal error""ing me 4 more times, during the best case of which I played 3 minutes with incredibly blurring textures coming right out of a PS1 game (all graphical options set to Ultra) and getting one-shotted by the second mob in a randomly generated ""easy"" difficulty dungeon. When I respawned it went cliched ""fatal error"" again. This conclude my brief experiment with this pre-pre-pre-alpha title. Good luck to you volunteer QA engineers out there.According my general experience with early access games, this might actually come out OK one day, possibly in the 2020s, if the dev doesn't act like the 90% of the early access titles' owners to cut & run at certain point. But even then I doubt I would dedicate any time to a perma-online Diablo-like game. But who knows, perhaps the developer will listen and give an option for players to run their own servers (like ARK does). Until then I'll reserve my opinion on the FINAL product and happily exercise my right to get a refund."

Crashes for me weren't super common but had a few.Max Level is 50, currently 5 classes.  The game is meant to be played in groups, however, there aren't many people playing so unless you have a bunch of friends playing or get lucky to get people similar level when your on, you will either solo or get power leveled.Soloing is possible, just slow and boring.  Some classes can solo better than others, however everyone can do it though it can be much more difficult for some than others.Getting a group and doing higher difficulties is fun, but unless max level it is pretty rare.Lots of worthless skills that are just useless, considering there isn't that many abilities to begin with, it just sucks.The core concept of a dungeon crawler you can do with friends is great but this game is not worth $30.

As of June 4th, much of the world is created, but there is nothing out there.Much of the world is just empty with landscapes everywhere but nothing to do 5 feet outside or inside of town, questing begins and ends just to show you where the inn is.It is impressive that a game can stand on it's core mechanics alone and that is the main thing I will praise this game for. The dungeons feel like something you would expect out of a skyrim or DnD. I could not imagine what it must feel like to actually have freinds with this game. Or, even the finished product.Either way,TL,DR: Kings and heros is a game with great potential and impressive game mechanics. But, that's where the fun begins and ends.

Starting a new character puts you very literally through 30 minutes of load screens, at the end of which you MAY be able to play, assuming the load screen goes away once the UI loads.

The lengthy load screens and the fact that the whole game stutters when you mouse over a button shows a complete lack of anything resembling optimisation.  They really should have taken a step back from the art department and sought out an experienced programmer, as it's clear there were none involved.I'll keep checking back periodically as the game is updated, as the patches do seem to be coming quickly, but frankly, the lack of polish, and the massive memory and storage use (second patch was seriously 1.3 gigs!) show either a lack of skill on the devs part, or lack of concern for their customers’ time, money, and experience, which is a shame.Oh, and public voice chat on by default and at top volume when you start the game is possibly the WORST idea ever concieved.

There is no point in this being multi-player, if one wanted an MMO like this, they would already be playing World of Warcraft.

I really don\'t see what the point of this game is, 8 people going down narrow corridors with all kinds of bright spell effects, unprecise targetting, and enemies that don\'t animate smoothly is not a recipe for fun gameplay.As for dynamically generating dungeons, so far all of my dungeons have been exactly the same (maybe a wall or two in a different place), and the same 3 types of enemies over and over. This is just not fun! I understand this is early access but I don\'t even understand the vision behind this game. It promises a lot of things but delivers on none of them. Core combat is unsatisfying, loot is represented as popup windows when clicking on a dead body, movement in groups is confusing, dungeons look very very similar and so do monsters, and crafting does not seem to work at all for me (I am stuck at level 6 for no obvious reason, and got there before crafting anything at all).My advice for the developers is to take the most important features they care about one by one and fix them rather than failing at 20 things simultaneously.I will still keep an eye on this game as for me exploring dynamic dungeons in first person and getting better and better loot is what I was hoping for and would still like to experience at some point in the future."

Max lev 50 not very hard to get with friends solo a bit more challenging. But what I really enjoy is crafting system while still early it gives me much hope. All crafts are a good choice makes you want multi toons or friends to have other ones. It reminds me alot of diablos with the fact its random in its quality meaning crafting pays off more you do it.

I usually avoid ""early access"" titles since the ugly trend of leaving your game unfinished to rot has been infecting the whole of Steam, but this one looks promising.THe gameplay is fun, a good variety when it comes to classes and races (even if they are the cliches we already know and love), it can be confusing at first because the game just throws you into town expecting you to know what you're doing. You'll die horribly in your first dungeon because being anything other than a ranged class in the beginning is pretty hard. Once you get used to your skills and the way groups work you'll feel right at home. There's plenty of loot and many things to kill.The only big problem i have with this game is the optimization. I couldn't write a ""review"" without pointing that out. It's terrible! Considering my specs and what i can usually run, this running at 20 fps just ins't working out. I had to tone down everything to get a decent framerate and by decent i mean 35-40 fps which is fine in a way but then the game just doesn't look as good. The combat might feel clunky for some as the hit detection is very touchy.That being said i have a feeling this game will keep on growing.

But, what is there is beautiful. Enemies are relatively versatile for an alpha.Gameplay - 9/10 - To some it may feel repetitive, but to me it's really enjoyable, actually having to aim your skills, play your abilities correctly and choose your path through the dungeon, with a plethora of bosses throughout said dungeons.Pros - Fun, engaging, very nice community, very fun and challenging, awesome visuals, a hell of a lot of potential.Cons- There's quite a few bugs which is to be expected of an alpha release. (skipping during running animations and such).Can get quite laggy at times as it is new so it can't support a massive bulk of players.Overall - I love this game for what it is now and for future potential I can see, I'd give it a solid 9/10.

,Recommended,436560,30644917,Posted: 20 March,all,Irelevus Murloc,"I'm afraid I'll be getting a refund due to false advertising. When a game says ""Single Player"" that means either theres a campaign or you can play without being connected to the internet. This game does neither. I have♥♥♥♥♥♥internet and have been looking for a nice dungeon crawler like this to play alone or with friends at a lan, games like Torchlight 2 do this well, but here I have to be connected to the internet. That is quite literally the opposite of single player. So that's a miss-tag. Other than that, the game is good, but I can't give it a thumbs up if it's got false advertising.EDIT(1): Stop commenting about how ""Single Player doesn't mean offline"" it does to me and many others who have been looking at games that say ""Single Player"" to mean offline and ""Multi Player"" to mean Online or Lan. As for what makes this game Single Player, the Devs have already explained it, your comment is woefully unecessary and does nothing more than enforce to me the idea that if you self important people are part of this games online community, I want even less to do with it. So thanks. Thanks a lot.EDIT(2): I have gotten the game once more, now with a better internet connection I can actually play the game, making me change my mind about recommending it, I still think that ""single player"" should mean that it's possible to play without needing a constant internet connection, but I will accept that it's not such a simple term, regardless of that, I recommend this game as it is fun but won't be taking down my original review as I think people should know that it's not offline.PS: Do you consider World of Warcraft a single player game? No of course not. It's an MMO, Kings and Heros is more of an MMO than a single player."

Despite all of that, the basic premise plays out really well when everything comes together and works as intended. What I mean by that is that after a few minutes getting accustomed  to the controles I actually managed to join a group of 4 others for a short dungeon run since they wanted a wizard to light things up a bit (passive torch spell). I came along, and the loot is fun - diablo-esque, the group dynamics are pretty good, and the world design/graphics hold up pretty nicely. After only about 25 min we wrapped it up since it was small and I thanked them for the time and logged off. So it was a short session, but it did sell me on what this game is trying to be and I\'m curious to see how it develops.Performance is OK, the patch seemed to have helped but I still had log in issues when I was testing stuff out. I\'ll try to log back in later and see how things go.Overall: This is clearly an early access game, bugs and all. When everything works, it feels like a first person Diablo title with a nice cozy central hub to chill at while getting a group together. Hopefully as work continues on the game they will be able to ensure that everything works much more often than not."
