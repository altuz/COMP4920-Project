76561198004846089,Recommended,436820,29857184,Posted: 11 February,all,intranuclear,Wow! This is now my absolute favorite! What an awesome feeling. I love the interface. It is simply excellent design for the Vive and the controllers. I can't believe this is free. I want the whole game. My kids are fighting on who plays next.
76561198325845373,Recommended,436820,29849688,Posted: 11 February,all,GreatYazer,Really fun experience. I wilsh there was more!  I can see this going in the direction of a puzzle fighter.  Find the clues to enter the rifts then have some spell type fighting.  Lots of potential for this game.

76561197979404316,Recommended,436820,29434709,Posted: 22 January,all,spacepenguin98,"While playing this game, I'm both ashamed and pleased to say I uttered the phrase ""I'm a mother******* sorcerer!"" more than once. For a free experience, this is well worth it for any fan of fantasy and wizards in particular.Even after experiencing all that I thought it had to offer, I found another little ""extra"" the other day. Throwing fireballs and flinging objects around the room hasn't gotten old yet."
