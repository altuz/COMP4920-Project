The locomotion is well done, a form of teleportation, but being unique in having the ability to travel in two different sizes (you can do a god mod, and a normal sized mode type deal). The game play is actually fun and there's depth to it, which seems to be lacking in other launch titles. Use of roomscale is useful as a game mechanic as well, giving you better view of the battle field. And then I also got lazy, sat on my floor, and just teleported everywhere. I wish there was a way to chose reorient direction when teleporting for when in lazy mode, but perhaps that will be done in an update.Overall, It's a turn based strategy that makes you feel like a kid playing with action figures, over all. excited to play some more, but thought I'd post a quick review for people checking it out.edit: also just noticed the minimum requirements list a 980. fwiw, I have a 770 2gb evga card and i didn't seem to have any issues."

Getting to move around the battlefield and scale yourself down to the size of the soldiers really makes the case for this being a VR game. The number of units and complexity of the actual battles doesn't live up to modern strategy games, but the ability to be in the world makes up for that. I can see this as a stepping stone to even more compelling VR strategy games and I'm happy to support the developers taking a chance in this early wild west of VR."

I think what sells it is that it feels like a tabletop war game but more interactive.  Plus you can zoom into the battlefield and get down to the soldiers perspective.  Really well laid out campaign that builds up nicely not trying to overwhelm you so you can get used to the controls and unit types.  This is one of the types of games I hoped we'd be seeing in VR, just didn't expect this well polished of a game at this point and honestly at a great price.I went into this game a bit leary with reading it had potential for frame rate drop.  I did experience this same drop however I did some analyzing and noticed my CPU wasn't maxed but was pretty high up there.  I closed everything except Steam and this app and it ran perfect.  I even tested jumping up and down and basically sitting on the floor trying to hide from the lighthouses to see if I could get anything weird to happen again.  Nope ran great.  I'm running a 980Ti stock with a 4th gen i5 so I imagine a newer i5 or even i7 would be more than fine, this game isn't very graphics intense as my 980Ti was barely putting any effort out, it's all CPU here so you know.Update: A recent all around Windows 10 and NVIDIA updates this thing runs amazing now even when I forget to shut down other apps."

I've been desperate for a good strategy game to play.  It's a turn based strategy game that actually seems pretty challenging so far.  I can't wait to really get some good play time in!  It's a game you could grab a stool or chair to sit on in your play space if you need a break from the active room-scale games.If I could figure out how to more reliably end the turns of my units I'd be set :)

I finished this game and there is a lot of content, a good number of well designed levels. I can very highly reccomend this game. The experience is very good fan (kind of addictive). The overall experience is very comfortable: no nausea whatsoever. The art/graphic design/animations are very nicely done, with a very good variety of characters nicley animated in a good looking and very varied environment. You can teleport and also change size to enjoy both a strategic overview in ""giant mode"", and also become as small as your soldiers to see the action close in front of you. The gameplay is actical, turn-based battles against in a story-driven campaign. You can upgrade your units.The negatives:On the negative side there a few bugs. Very, very few bugs as it ia a robust game, but I have mention one bug because it can be a bit annoying: occasionaly, you cannot click to finish your turn and so the game is stuck. Because you cannot save in the middle of a battle, you cannot undo, and because battles can last a very long time, you can see where the occasional frustration comes from. But, I have to add, it is a rare bug: maybe once every 6 hours of play.There are a few ""quick wins"" that the developer hasn't added yet to the game, and I hope will be added soon: multiplayer, and a choice of difficulty levels: as it stands, each level is fairly easy to pass at the first attempt."

It's a fun and unique experience and I hope it gets the attention it deserves.  While many of the early Vive titles have been dismissed as tech demos or half-baked, Quar stands out as a fully fleshed out title well worth its asking price and one that I hope is the start of new and exciting way to experience strategy games."

For me, it could do with being a little bit harder - I basically played through all the battles, only having tor try one once (and crashed half way through one). There are more battles than I first though, and they do slowly get more complex, but not really much of a challenge yet. I'm three hours in so far and it feels that once I'm done there won't be much reason to go back and re-play the battles."

If you like turn based strategy this is definitely worth getting as this is one of the few games that has enough content to keep you busy for 10+ hours.  I wouldn't say that there is a lot of replayability, but if they were to add a new expansion with the same number of missions for $8-10 I would definitely go for it.  I would suggest some larger maps with more scenarios, but I expect that there were system limitations that made that difficult."

Great value and lots of fun. A few small bugs here and there but overall a polished and professional experience! I can't wait to see more games like this.I never spent much time checking out the world in the small, character-sized zoom level because it wasn't really useful, cool though it may be. Sometimes the airplanes messed with me by flying through my head, did not like that at all, hah. Also the unit logic was a bit off sometimes, like how you use a shotgun or a sniper rifle to kill tanks instead of some kind of rocket launcher, but once you get used to it, it's no problem. Haven't played through the whole game yet but I'm around 10 levels in and still having lots of fun. Easily worth what it costs."

It really does take me back to playing war with my action figures of old. I have always been a fan of turn based strategy games, and this one does it quite well. There is an actual story here too, although I haven't been playing it long, I can honestly say I am happy with my purchase and I hear this game is around 10 hours long. If you are a fan of turned based strategy do yourself a favor and buy it soon. This game really does need more reviews so the word gets out about this little gem."

I never really understood when it was my turn or my moves were up.  It seemed to say select units (when my turn was over?)  ""END TURN"" sometimes worked and sometimes didn't. I wasn't use what or how to end. I clicked the PAD button... sometimes worked and sometimes didn't.  Did I need to make sure that white dot sliding around the pad was down?  OF course would be better with a real person playing the other side.  I completed - 3 missions. tutorial, king of the hill and capture the flag(s) I used points to upgrade my airport.   But due to UI being flaky - not real sure yet how to play?  moves when? sometimes I can hunker, other times I can't. Though the option is still there?  Maybe this should be in the discussion group. So back to the review... graphics are VERY well done for the VIVE.  (lack of res = ( is vives fault).  This is probably the most polished VIVE title I've played and bought so far. (others are like quickly get them out - or demos).  I recommend highly, but I really help they improve the interface.  Also there was no back to start menu (settings/graphics) and no  ""EXIT"" I had to remove headset and close the window.  I also couldn't click the steamVR button to get back to VR menu.

Quar is a mediocre turn based strategy game with limited options.  Throwing it in VR makes it immersive and gives you the option to view the battle from a godlike view or life sized with the troops.  While that is fun the neat visuals do not make it a good game and actually make controlling your army very frustrating.  Any value as a strategy game Quar has is overshodowed by the terrible controls and the fact the VR really adds nothing to the game."

I think some of the calculations seems a little silly to me, but maybe they tested the balance of the game and found it needed to be that way. For example, the HMG should mow down anyone out in the open, but often times it doesn't. Maybe i'm just really unlucky. I would say the same should be true for the machine gun ability of the Baewyr (sp?) It can get frustrating to have enemy troops that are right next to a machine gun out in the open and you either don't hit them or kill only one of their rhyflers. Other than that, this game is a blast! Please add more maps and even add a map generator/creation tool so people can make their own and share them online! Then the fun will never end!"

There's a tutorial and 14 missions all replayable, it has good graphics and solid gameplay.  The base has upgrades that increase your units stats, so you have some balancing of what to upgrade first and see how it affects the next mission.Cool effects like planes buzzing around the battlefield right above you while the units are going through their turn based fight on the ground.You set up your troops/vehicles in open positions on the field, then start.  The turn based is different than I'm used to and it's one turn per side, I move and attack, then they move and attack, until each side uses all of their units, then it starts over.  Good concept and works great.I like the option of being up above the map and looking down, or shrinking down to be at your units height and see from their perspective.

It is spiritually pretty similar to a VR table top version of Civ 5's combat.The game has way more content then most other VR games out right now, somewhere around 7-10 hours.  Also the gameplay is turn based which is refreshing compared to most other VR titles right now whish seem to be wave based or Arcade, both of which feel frantic.The Art design is a little different, but ultimately works.  The fact that it is structured around exagerated WWI concepts helps I think.The game desperately needs a skirmish mode though, if they added the ability to jump into a randomized battle/map this would be a heavy weight title."

A level begins with you placing down the troops which you pick. Then it lets you use one of them, then the opponent gets to use a troop. This goes on until all troops are used once. Then you can use the other troops again. You have a base in which you can upgrade buildings to for example have ''Rhyfhlemen'' get more accuracy.

,Not Recommended,436940,22799588,"Posted: 4 May, 2016",all,KrK Schwarz-W-R,"Can´t recommend the game anymore. Main reason is that there is no further content following. At the beginning there were plans for additional skirmish and multiplayer mode. With that the game would be awesome. Now you get for the money a <~10 hour experience. It´s only one campaign and after finishing it there is not much reason to play it again. It´s still a nice game but after the campaign you want more and there is nothing more to do. A skirsmish mode would be so great, it´s sad that they don´t want to develop it anymore. I think the game is very unique + the concept very good and it would get a lot of positiv attention and a growing playerbase with more game-modes. Can´t imagine that it´s not worth to take the already created nice content and make a skirmish mode out of it. But I´m no game developer/publisher and we will never know.Old Review: I can highly recommend this game, it´s great and makes a lot of fun. It´s really cool to change the position and take a look on the battlefield in different angels. The zoom-in-function and the fighting animation are working very good and are impressive. I didn´t used it enough because I was too much focused on the next turn, I will change that behaviour in the future. ;-) No bugs or problems in the 10 hours of gaming through the campain. Also no frame problems, I didn´t tracked it but I had no problems at any time and I have a R9 290, an i5-3350P and 8 GB ram.I´m waiting already for the skirmish mode, that will be implented next and then multiplayer is coming!!! :-) I already see myself playing this game for a lot of hours, having a really good time alone and with other players. If it´s not a lot more work a 2 vs 2 players mode on a huge map would be sooo awesome. And/or a point system for multiplayer mode where you get higher ranks, medals or such stuff. Always good to see a result of gaming, that´s at the moment really nice in form of upgrading your buildings to increase the abilities of your different troops. But I have no idea how much work this it. I will be already happy when skirmish is coming and than the multiplayer. ;-)The price is really cheap for this beautiful and good game. If you compare it with the prices and content of other VR games it´s nearly for free. ;-)Highly recommended, hope to see you on the battlefield in a hopefully not to late future. :-) I`m a big fan already. Thanks a lot to the devs for the great work (if you need a beta-tester for the new modes feel free to contect me ;-) )."
