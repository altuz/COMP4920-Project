76561197970320868,Recommended,437020,32714824,Posted: 24 June,all,sizer99,"This is a great intro to bullet hell shooters for newbies or a fun diversion for people who already like them.  Edit: I think anyone will find the 'insane' level has a reasonable quantity of bullets.#1 tip - DON'T HIT BUTTONS at the '1977' title screen or at the start of new levels, or you'll miss all the 'plot'. Just sit back and laugh your♥♥♥♥♥off.Shooting is automatic as long as you hold the shoot key down, enemies are large and colorful, shots stand out well, and there's a time stop and warp mechanism that means that as long as you see the bullet coming you're effectively invincible on easy mode - oh, you'll die a lot to start with if you're new, but once you get the hang of it and of avoiding bullets being the most important thing you'll be okay.I've beaten normal mode which is a tad easy for bullet hell (I've beaten Ten and Till in Lowres Kingdom, I know hell), but there are two higher levels I'll be back for when I have more time  And, the huge variation in the optional weapons really changes things up.Finally, the story is great. Instead of going the mysterious emo route like Touhou or Murasaki (which I love, but the plot is trying way too hard) it just goes for outright absurd and funny.  Character art is done by Shake-O, the guy who draws Doctor Hitomi's Infirmary.  He can draw better than this, but Meglilo is from 1977.Noob tips:* Shooting things is great, but avoiding bullets is your #1 priority.* The #2 most important thing is having the right weapon for the area.  If you've got the right weapon things are easy, if you don't it's hell.  When the game gives you powerup drones to shoot, shoot them and take it. It's almost always the right weapon for the next area.* Use your warp whenever you need it - it regenerates, and better to use it now and run out later than die now.* Pay attention at the start - the game will explicitly introduce you to the concept of the 'hitbox'. Meglilo's head and feet don't count if hit by bullets, only the blinking bit in her back does!* Kitchy is mai waifu, get away from her YOU BIT... oh, she's dead. :/"

A charming little game that seems to support 640x480 SD, which is nice to see, because I personally don't like pixel art. Its not all blocky on my 34"" 2560x1080 ultrawide and seems to scale just fine. Its sort of a 22ish letterbox display. really quite cutesy story, graphics and sound. I really like how you can warp to other parts of the screen, very interesting useful concept, but use it sparingly because it take time to build your warp energy up. game really looks and feels like an old DOS game, uses a typical pre-XBOX 10 button controller, for those of us old enough, PC had a standard 10 button 4 axis controller, 2 axis being for rudder control used in flight games. This being said, a typical ""fight stick"" for PC is what it was made for. Hence the partial controller support, generally full support means its meant for an XBox compatiable controller. But given the fact it looks and feels like something out of the 90s, its just right that it supports controllers out of the 90s too. This is a really fun well done port. Probably should have had full controller support, but thats forgivable if you understand the difference, so not really any reason to get your panties in a bunch. Given the fact its a well above average SHMUP at such a reasonable price, not really an issue for me, just an observation. What are you still reading this for, go and buy it already. VERY cute fun game!"

,Recommended,437020,24334292,"Posted: 15 July, 2016",all,-[FF]- Pendleton,"Don't be fooled by the graphical presentation. It's a solid game that's definitely a toss up from the other Astro Port games. I think it shares alot of gameplay mechanics from one unreleased on steam: Zangeki Warp. To sum up: you're a girl like Sailor Moon, but you're also a robot. And you kick♥♥♥♥♥ Your primary gimmick is to be able to warp from one area of the screen to another, to avoid often inescapable walls of bullets, or environmental hazards. Decently pulled off, and as it runs on an energy meter, you won't be spamming it every other level. It takes alot of strategy to pull off.+gameplay is challenging and is what you'd expect from a shmup.+story has some black humor. Not a bad thing in the slightest, but it's a toss up from the normal campy atmosphere of some of astro port's titles. Think Steel strider/Gigantic Army levels of humor.+No checkpoints here, so like Armed Seven and Vulkaiser, if you lose all your health or your lives, you're dead. So it's best to not get hit. I consider this a positive because it's more of an incentive to not get killed, although I have nothing against checkpoint systems if they're done right.+no glitches as far as I know. Gamepad integration works just fine+resolution is just fine too. You can stretch the window like you could with GA and Wolflame.+the devs are very quick to listen to feedback, and they're very friendly. You can tell they're passionate about their work.-The music can get pretty grating during the story segments, so don't expect a stellar OST there.-the game seems like it's rather short, but for 5 bucks it's a good deal-it's a shmup in a sea of shmups. I love the genre, but I can understand if someone's already had enough shoot em up arcade titles. If you have no problem with another installment, then this shouldn't concern you.-graphics are weaker than Astro Port's other titles, by a larger margin. I guess that's the point, to illustrate the tonal difference between badass giant robots and a sailor moon-esque atmosphere. More of a subjective than a negative.Two thumbs up. I'd recommend it, although it could use some more polish. (I'll be editing my review as time goes on, because Astro Port is a pretty quick dev when it comes to fixes. for example, they've already patched achievements so I've removed that negative)"

76561198006276098,Recommended,437020,24353456,"Posted: 16 July, 2016",all,Samurai Cop,"Cute'em ups seem rare to come by these days, especially on Steam. Witch-Bot Meglilo is probably one of the better ones I've played in recent times. Even though it features some twisted comedy, I think that it's still fair to compare it. It seems to feature all the staples that make a good cutem up. Between the cutesy characters, bizarre yet hilarious story and dialogue in between cut scenes; along with some pretty funny boss designs. You're given a pretty wide selection of weapon power ups combinations to choose from. It makes the experience fairly enjoyable to have a good amount of options with weaponry since you're limited to Meglilo as your only character to select.The time stop warp mechanic adds a whole different strategy to the way you can play the game. Some of the bullet patterns and level designs require you to become pretty handy with it. Most of the time you can survive without having to rely on it if you're good at dodging. The controls and hitbox size lend themselves well to that style if you have quick enough reactions.The game does offer a fair amount of challenge on hard and insane for more veteran plays. Even if you're not a master at shooters you can still probably enjoy and complete the game rather easily on the lower settings. To make things easier for more casual players you're given shield power-ups that allow you to take a few hits as well as lives. Although the game features no continues so once you're dead it's back to the very start of the first stage again.The music isn't bad. It fits well with the game and has some cheerful tunes but nothing to memorable and a bit repetitive at times. Most of the backgrounds I find to be rather bland and unchanging. It would have been nice had they put more work into those. It's a tad bit short and lacking in extra modes but all in all I found it to be a really enjoyable game.If you've already played some of Astroport's previous games like Supercharged Robot Vulkaiser you'll also probably enjoy that Meglilo takes place in the same universe. I believe if you're a fan of this sub-genre; whether you're more of a hardcore player or just enjoy these kind of games for a bit of quick fun you won't regret purchasing it. Well recommended."

I kind of can't believe it hasn't been done before, it probably has, but it's not something I've seen in a danmaku game yet, and I play 'em all :) reminds me of the kind of new things bullet eater games like Ikaruga and Exceed 2nd can pull off when they don't have to worry about providing gaps to graze through. I haven't beaten it yet as it's deceptively hard but I give it full credit. play this game if you want a new take on a vertical shootemup :)"

The desing it's a tribute to old mangas from the 70's done with a lot of humor, and the gameplay, bosses and weapons are really great for a budget game. Totally recomended."

It is basically a bullet-hell game, with Tohou like boss battles. The story is bonkers, and it does not take itself too seriously. On a whole it is pretty entertaining. Recommended."
,Recommended,437020,25435325,"Posted: 9 September, 2016",all,troojg,"Very fun game. I know it looks kinda dumb, but it's great. Basically what makes it interesting is the different shot types you can get, and in place of having a bomb you can warp somewhere. This gives you quite a few ways to approach the stages. Add on an amusing story and you've got a pretty fun time."

The simple yet beautiful artstyle, music, many interesting weapon power-ups (you can try many crazy combinations), bosses and well-drawn characters really makes it unique!In short, great shmup for newcomers since it is very pleasant to the eyes, but challenging enough for veterans too thanks to its many difficulty levels!"
,Recommended,437020,31033113,Posted: 8 April,all,Galaxy Eyes,"99% of the reason why I bought this game was because you get to play as a teleporting robot witch magical girl that gets to blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up, which is ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME.That being said, the game actually turned out to be pretty darn good with some interesting mechanics. The art and music are nice and the story is pretty silly and amusing. The difficulty can spike quite high for those looking for a challenge but it's still enjoyable enough even for noobs like me. There are also achievements and trading cards, which are always a welcome addition. It's a pretty basic yet fun and weird game that's a great way to kill some time.My only real gripe is that the dark humor can get pretty repetitive after about the first two bosses, but eh the humor overall adds character to the game."

I ended up buying this fantastic piece of software for one single reason, the flying cross-eyed, derptastic bird that randomly comes out in each level. The first few encounters, it freaked me out and caused me to fly into enemies, walls, or stray bullets. I realized he can't die. I went to delete the game, but I came back. WHY? SO MANY QUESTIONS. Why does it follow me? What is its purpose? Why are his eyes crossed? Is he a powerup? WHY DOESN'T HE DO ANYTHING? For some reason, I'm compelled to find out this avian creature's history. Is he an intergral part of this game's universe? Is he God?  Does he have sinister and, or perverted plans for  our flying heroine. All I know is I must keep playing. I  must complete this game to obtain the truth. Too bad I'm terrible at the game and keep dying at the final boss.9 out of 10.Buy the game and let us discover the mystery together."
,Recommended,437020,25334616,"Posted: 3 September, 2016",all,Ness1228,"I feel this game is best reviewed with a simple pros and cons list.ProsThe demo gives a spot-on accurate feel of what the game is like and what to expectSeveral difficulty settings to match any skill levelSimple and customizable (i.e. remappable) controls that are very easy to learnSkippable cutscenesSeveral levels are designed around Meglilo's teleport-mechanic, encouraging (but not abusing) the use of this game's gameplay gimmickLots of different power-ups to add variety to gameplayUnlockable new clothing and outfits serve to make Meglilo even cuter.The story refuses to take itself seriously, from the very beginning to the very endZA WARUDO! TOKI WO TOMARE!WRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!ConsThe screen can get cluttered, especially in later levels; it's often hard to tell which bullets are yours and which are the enemies'Resolution is locked at 640x480, although fullscreen fits it to your monitor in proper 4:3Absolutely no way to toggle between fullscreen and windowed mode; you're prompted to choose between either upon launching the gameIf you're interested in the story, the dialogue presents itself at its own pace; pressing a button skips the cutscene entirelyThe soundtrack is decent, but gets repetitive at timesNo in-game volume adjustmentsHitting escape instantly closes the game; I did this by accident, thinking it would pause the game. There's a separate pause button you can configure in the options menuCutscenes contain (censored) gore which can be very jarring/unnerving to unexpecting audiences; viewer discretion is advisedIn conclusion, I think this game is definitely worth looking into. The downsides to this game pale in comparison to what it has to offer. $6 USD is a little on the high side for a game like this, but I would absolutely recommend picking it up if it goes on any kind of sale (I bought it for 30% off and feel it's well worth that price).I was sold when I learned about the unlockable Maid and Kimono outfits."

There's lots of different weapons to try out, and the warp mechanic is easy to use but tricky to master.The game is pretty tough. I still haven't beaten it on easy, but I am a noob at these sorts of games.My main gripe is that you can't save after each level...I literally just have to beat the final boss, but I have to go through the whole game to get there. It's exhausting.That said, I still keep coming back to it."
