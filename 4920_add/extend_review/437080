I find the shooting from the ship FUN and the flying fun, but a little to easy.  Ship doesn't float, and you can't move one way and rotate and shoot behind you while traveling in the same bearing.  Then to ""DRILL"" you click a button and the ship  ""AUTO MOVES"" in to drill. I'd rather have a cross hair appear and have to maneuver the ship into place to drill.  So it's lacking some of the game finesse I'd like to have seen included.   One other things like other games - (why does it FLASH out to VR background?) I find that really irritating.  SURELY they can make it fade to title screen or black...  I keep thinking I've crashed out of the game.I've completed a couple missions - it was fun, but  VERY easy...  ""what I mean by a walk through"".  I'd really love to see a bit more complexity.  Still one of the most polished games so far. I'm tired of buying all the crap. I now have restraint... and will wait for the quality titles.GET IT - but don't expect a lot of excitement, challenge or acrade action. It is at least calling me back to play more...  which is more than I can say for 90% of the VR titles so far.  A real nice hint of THINGS TO COME."

The music is great.It also has a higher difficulty than most vr games. It's one of the few story-driven VR games there are and that alone is awesome.It does have some slight problems that probably will be fixed though.As I'm writing this I'm two hours into the game, but haven't reached an ending yet."

This game is not meant to be compared with ED; It has very simple intuitive controls and simple gameplay which follows a linear but entertaining story.  Few suggestions based on my short experience so far: it would be good to be able to remap the flight controls (I am lefty and it would be good to be able to switch trust/fire). It would also be good to have a full mission debrief with some statistics like accuracy/resources gained, etc."

You get a high quality game with immersive atmosphere, great voice acting and design and most importantly a real story. This is not your typical VR Demo game that shows you the possibilities of VR. This is actually a real game and worth every penny. Yes it probably takes only 2-3 hours to complete, but these are 2-3 hours of high quality gaming. I'd prefer spending 20$ on a short game that I really enjoy rather than on a game that is filled with too much boring content. In the end these high quality short games are the ones that motivate me enough to really play until the end.Really looking forward to Episode 2!"

I could complain about the length or the price, but regardless of being an episodic game, this one here, has quality. Professional voice acting, nice graphics and a really awesome soundtrack. Being a VR title, the challenge of a well thought out VR experience nailed my expectations. The cockpit interaction, the navigation through the ship deck and the combats feel just right. I would definitely recommend this and I'm curious for Episode 2!"

76561197965583985,Not Recommended,437080,24688123,"Posted: 3 August, 2016",all,Tenka,"Updated! - See below for my previous review.I am greatly dissapointed to have to change my status from thumbs up to thumbs down. I had high hopes for this game. However a game breaking glitch prevented us from continuing after the 5th mission or so. That was not what made me change my mind though, the fact is the devs responded and fixed it in a timely manner - which was great!However, upon continuing to play once the glitch was fixed, I would realise the shocking fact that that mission was in fact the FINAL mission of the game which abruptly ends on a cliff hanger with a ""To be continued"" message.I don't know if it was intentionally glitched to hide that fact or not. But what I do know is that this game that costs $20 only lasts less than 2 hours. Note that my time is just above 2 hours, but I spent a good portion of that replaying the last mission trying to get past the glitch before it was fixed.Everything I posted in my previous review is still true, but I was under the impression that I had only seen a small portion of the game. It turns out I had seen about 95% of it.I am extremely dissapointed ... but recommend that you wait until this goes on sale to pick it up for around $5, because what there is is pretty good.sigh...My Previous review.Solid gameplay backed up by a strong narrative component.THIS is exactly the kind of game VR needs.The voice acting is decent, the character models are passable.. but it actually puts YOU into the pilot seat AND in the briefing room. You get to follow the characters story while also flying around a space ship and blowing stuff up, mining asteroids and exploring deep space wreckage.This game is the first step into taking VR from ""experience gameplay"" to ""story driven gameplay"" and it works beautifully. Sure its still not a AAA experience, but what we need for VR is MORE of this and it definitely deserves your support. I highly recommend it."

Most of them are AMAZING, and you get a feeling of being in the Star Trek holo deck... and some of them are even great examples of well-put-together games (great example: Vanishing Realms).But if you want story + game: Get Space Rift. In all the VR games that I've tried, I haven't found a single one where story, gameplay and presentation are blended together to this great big sauce of awesomeness. The atmosphere is dazzling. I find myself curving through Space, beeps and blips of my cockpit around me, movielike music playing in the background... I could try and describe the mix of feelings all day, it wouldn't do this game justice. The controls work pretty well, I've encountered some smaller problems, but nothing that could kill the mood really.JUST GET IT. If you're anything like me, and you like science fiction in space environments, you'll LOVE this game. I have to say I was pretty reluctant to get it at first after seeing all the negatives here, but even if I'm close to the ending, I still whole-heartedly recommend this game. Heck, I'll play through it multiple times just to relive the feeling and see the whole movie/story play out again."

While this most definitely isn't the case, I was more than positively surprised. As the pace in the opening segments of the game pick up, I began going about my thing, almost forgetting I'm playing a game. Add to this the decent dogfight combat and I'm most definitely satisfied!Having both VR headsets on hand, I figured I'd try it with the Oculus Rift first in order to revalidate how well the unit works without even having the xbone controller plugged in. This game plays excellently with mouse and keyboard only.I did encounter one issue at a point where the probe was stuck in ""landing"" phase and never started drilling. It happened just once in around 1h30m of play.Video of first impressionshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTdPhqdLvJESlightly past the 13:30 mark the probe bug takes place."

Alos, when there was a bug it was fixed same day, so excellent response time.On the other had, it is WOEFULLY short for the price. Regrettably this is more of an issue because it IS so good...and because it is so obviously unfinished. I wanted MORE dammit. I also feel cheated because I feel it should have been marketed more clearly as ""Episode 1"" or something, so you at least had a chance to know you weren't going to get an ending.I've defended other games (Inside) on the basis of their artistry and storytelling. But this combination of an EXTREMELY short game and the feeling that I was misled into buying it as a complete title, when it's actually just ""Part 1"" has left a bitter taste.Whether or not I buy part two will depend entirely on the price as a result.Original review was;Really was enjoying this until one of the missions seems to bug out...Gravidas Station...I find the escape capsule, but then it just says ""awaiting objective""....anyone got a fix?"

,Not Recommended,437080,24685408,"Posted: 3 August, 2016",all,Voodoogamer,"**Update. I just finished the game! Way too short at a little over 3 hours played! It was fun while it lasted, looking forward to it being more open ended in the future. I did think that the game would have A LOT more play time, as it was not an early access game. You should be able to get more than 3 hours worth of play (just over refund time on Steam) for the asking price. This is probably more appropriate at $5 -$10 if it is going to stay this short! So thumbs down for now.But here is my review up to 2 hours playing (thinking there was much more to come):Did I just purchase this game totally by accident and discover one heck of an awesome game? Well, that is just what happened. I just launched the game in VR, and was like Holy Sh@@! I can't wait to jump in the game! AND THEN my friend called, and all I could think about was the wah wah sound that Charlie Brown makes, and that lasted for an hour, yes, really. Anyways, as soon as the phone call ended I started playing and played until nearly 1 AM, I have to be up at 6, so I will play another hour after leaving this review.Suggestions: Use a gamepad. It is so much easier to control.What is the game like? In some aspects, the mission briefings remind me of XCOM. The flying reminds me of Wing Commander and Descent combined, with some physics like you would see in Battlestar Gallactica on a massive scale. I wholeheartedly love flying in this game. Shooting is easy and I like the default controls. I didn't even realize you can change weapons. BTW look at the monitors in the game, and an A or something will pop up, even for the one that says menu on the screens, they are not just art. One changes your weapon...I like mining for things, I love the graphics, I was blown away totally by how addictive it is. The sounds are great and I had no crashes during a 2 hour marathon.The price is soooo worth it. Easily the best purchase yet I have made for VR. I wonder about its longevity, but time will tell. I will certainly get my money's worth!"

I've no idea of its length or what it plans to unfold but I like how the cockpit is handled and its use of the ship. The text on the screen is CLEAR Unlike ELITE DANGEROUS and the view distance in space seem crisper. The flying feels just a notch below however at this point but a welcome trade off being that I actually LIKE flying now because I read my controls !Great title I RECOMMEND. I'll update more when I can!WELL, I GOTTA JOIN THE THUMBS DOWN CLUB! heres why, THEY DONT DISCERN THAT THIS IS AN EPISODIC game. i thought id be getting a complete game, i bought it was excited to spend the weekend playing it to tell you guys about it, when i see all the negative reviews about the games LENGHT AND ABRUPT ending!with that, it has to be thumbs down because had i known, it may have changed my purchase plans."
,Not Recommended,437080,24686302,"Posted: 3 August, 2016",all,Tigerhawk71,"On the upside:- The story concept is nice and hasn't been done to absolute death - but it's clearly inspired by games like Red Faction.- There seems to be some decent banter between MC and the AI and i'm sure it helps drive the story- The voice acting isn't entirely atrocious.- Controls are simple, intuitive and responsive.On the downside:- The minimalistic cockpit is great for visibility, but people who struggle with sim sickness will struggle with this (i'm not one of those people)- The scale of objects is so odd that it's almost comically huge in some instances yet curiously far too small in others. So the sense of presence, the feel of being somewhere i'm not just... isn't there. The desk in the opening sequence looks like it's for a toddler - everything just looks wrong.- When you DO get close to something it only highlights the horrible texturing and general lack of detail.If the scale and textures were improved i would seriously revisit this game. As it stands now, there's nothing here that isn't done better in two other games - EVE Valkyrie and Elite."

At least with The Gallery Episode 1, which is about the same length and also ends on a cliffhanger, you expected that since it said ""Episode 1"" in the title. But with this game there is no indication in the title or description that it is an episodic game, so I was expecting a longer game with a full story completed with a satisfying ending. So I was very disappointed when I saw ""To Be Continued"" after only 2 hours of playtime."

The character/game doesn't point at or away from my monitor as set up, it points the character off to the side forcing me to turn sideways in my chair.  The game supports the HTC Vive, but insists on mouse and keyboard instead of the Vive controllers, which could easily support the game's functions.  I meet the system specs, but it still drops frames and occasionally skips out of the game and shows the Vive environment, even in the middle of game play.  All in all, it might be a fun story, but the headache from the skipped frames was a bit too much, especially for $20.

I like a lot that this is not an arcade wave shooter game but story driven with a very diverse gameplay. Only fights are a bit repetitive so far.Positive:+ graphics, controls, voice acting (at least in german)Negative:- pause between missions at the station, controls there are not very good- the cursor buttons on both of my game pads do not work, so i need the keyboard in addition- during the missions (at least 2 and 3), there is a constant stream of random fighting (every few minutes, 3 drones jump in) - this is very repetitiveAll in all a good game."
