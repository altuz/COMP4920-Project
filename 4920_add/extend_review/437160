,Recommended,437160,30647710,Posted: 21 March,all,Case,"Utterly charming visual novel (not an adventure!) about bright young minds in turn-of-the-century Vienna. Each episode covers a different character, Ep. 1 a composer secretly in love with her mentor, Ep. 2 a portrait painter struggling to capture all facets of his subjects, Ep. 3 a mathematician who needs to disguise herself as a man to be taken seriously. Each character is shown to perceive a hidden reality, be it sounds, images or ideas where they draw their inspiration from. Along the way you encounter famous Viennese such as Sigmund Freud and Gustav Klimt. It's really beautiful, artistic, grown-up stuff - just be prepared that there is almost zero interactivity, only four or five different choices you can take per episode."

Each epsiode wonderfully crafted with a genuinely heartwarming tale with a beautifully rendered sountrack. Got to play each one multiple times to fully appreciate it (Yes, your choices shape the game quite well, and in this one, the titular music itself)Not to miss."

The whole game was a charming half hour experience.I hope the episodes aren't far apart in releases."

,Recommended,437160,24281125,"Posted: 12 July, 2016",all,asebist,"Beautiful, artful, filled with scenery and live, a wonderful experience.This is an exzellent example of a well paced evolution of a digital narrative. It's more like a living, slightly interactive visual novel than a game. And it is an artful, well crafted experience with very well done art direction and sound design. After finishing it, I wanted to replay it, just to revisit the well drawn sceneries and have a new chance for other conversations, but I will do that on my iPad, when it is released on mobile too.Everybody should try it. It's 2 to 3 hours time of your life and if you enjoy it support the devs with buying the season pass. I sure as hell did so.Aaaaand I love those credits, a living picture or Wimmelbuch :)Thank you devs for this experience."

,Recommended,437160,30135336,Posted: 23 February,all,MarionTommo,"As a person who indulges in pixel art, this game is beyond beautiful. I can look at it all day and the soundtrack was just as beautiful as the game is. Truly amazing. Storyline was great. Everything in this game just felt right. Some parts of this game really hit me hard and it makes you really think of yourself in the shoes of the character. Honestly, the best part of the first episode has got to be Leos. He really made my day. (in fact i'm planning of buying the seasonal passes because this game is too good)"

,Recommended,437160,30070936,Posted: 20 February,all,EyzmairIlicia,"Okay bear with me because I'm no good with words, especially with a game that leaves you absolutely speechless (in the good way).This game is genuinely beautiful and well developed. The motifs and imagery in it are absolutely stunning, empowering to both the protagonist and players. Its story line is simple yet fluid, focused on a young and talented violinist named Wilma who aims for recognition and acceptance while struggling with her inner demons. The game expresses that it's okay to have your doubts and anxiety, in yourself, your situation, and in others, but that you should not let your fears take control you. With every note composed, Wilma finds the strength and courage to counter each uncertainty, and her final work is sure to leave a tear in your eye with its gorgeous tones and symbolism.Many thanks to the team who developed such a beautiful game with a story we can relate to and the amazing cuts of music that sparked a variety of emotions. I highly recommend this game for anyone who'd want to enjoy an extraordinary yet simple piece of art. It's honestly worth every penny. I cannot express enough how amazing it is."

,Recommended,437160,29708429,Posted: 4 February,all,🅱️enis,"After just 0.7 hours on this game, only doing episode 1, I love it. I'm thinking about buying the season pass, so I can play all the episodes, but if I don't, just telling you, playing through episode 1 is a interesting story, about the main character (of episode 1), Wilma on her journey to create a piece of music. She has to work over the problems that approach her, while making the music. That's a basic, lazy explanation of the game, the game go much deeper than that. If you'd like to know more about the game before downloading it (episode 1 is free, but the rest are like $3.00 0r something), just message me about the game... I loved this game, 10/10!"
