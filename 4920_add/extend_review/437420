It’s definitely worth getting it if it’s on a sale or a bundle. It’s a direct sequel to the second game, so if you want to understand things better you should play Masked Intent first.I also found this sequel slightly better than Masked Intent. It also shares the same “problem” too: the “in game” art is amazing, but the cutscenes are in a terrible quality.5/10."
,Recommended,437420,21865987,"Posted: 16 March, 2016",all,Vic=HKC=,"Sara Pennington thought she could breathe a little after defeating the traitor in the Order of Griffins. However, the artefacts she retrieved are unstable and cause damage, eventually killing her father. In order to prevent that fate, she has to go back in time and find the kingdom of King Amedon, Aeronheart...While you didn't really need to play the first game, which isn't on Steam, to understand The Secret Order 2: Masked Intent, I think that it's better to play the sequel before Ancient Times.  But even without the previous knowledge, the game in itself is very understandable. The storyline is also well-done, as many twists are also present and given how the game ended, you know that there will be a fourth game (already released elsewhere). I just hope that Artifex Mundi got also the rights to publish New Horizon (the first game) and Beyond Time (the fourth) so that we will have the whole saga on Steam.The gameplay hasn't really changed from the last game: you're still picking items, solving puzzles, clearing list of hidden objects (whether it's a written list or a pictured one). You have also a little helper, a little baby Griffin that can fly and take things for you when you can't access them (unless the game is requiring you to use a ladder...).The game is now more oriented towards fantasy, as the famous kindgom, existing towards 3500 ACN, is based on a medevial society with champions and on fantasy as you have dragons and griffins in it. Anyway, you don't know if you're in another world or if you're really in the past. Besides, Cyrus and Zerina, the brother and sister turned evil, are also two sides of a coin: one is living in a palace in the desert and the other was more attracted to an icy landscape. King Amedon was somewhat in the middle...The graphics were nice: I loved the mythical realm but you didn't get in it immediately, as you begin first at the HQ of the secret order before visiting London in the 19th century. After that, you're stuck in Aeronheart and the bonus chapter is telling you a tale set directly after your adventure, where, again, the fantasy is the main theme: dwarves, elves and fairies will be in the center of it.I loved the soundtrack too, even if it was always the same tune whether you were in the desert or in the ice land.In other words, The Secret Order 3 is a nice sequel, very well constructed and leaving you with a cliffhanger of some sorts. As usual, Artifex Mundi chose well and I'll be happy if I see in the Upcoming List the fourth game. I don't know if it's an hint from Artifex or if it was already inside when the game was released before Artfiex but there is a banner with Beyond Time inside the game. So, yeah, I do hope that it will arrive in 2016 on Steam."

The story is pretty straight forward and most of it is set in a fantasy world.The presentation is well done. Just the quality of the videos and the voice acting is sub par. Both don't affect the game much though and the graphics are just beautiful. The music suits the setting and doesn't get annoying.Some of the puzzles/minigames are way too easy and only consist of matching shapes and/or colors. The achievements in this game are also aimed at a *very* casual audience. The inventory based puzzles are much better though and they easily outweigh the weaker aspects of the game.The bonus chapter seems a bit rushed though with a lot of 'find x similar items to use in the next minigame' puzzles. Still the artwork and also the story make it worth at least one playthrough.Overall another fun casual adventure game that you can sink a couple of hours in."

,Recommended,437420,29171146,Posted: 10 January,all,Quiet Siren,"The Secret Order 3: Ancient Times was a fun follow up to TSO2. The story line continues, and while the plot is thin (aren't they all in casual games(?) so not complaining here, hey that's the meaning of casual) the pace moves along without an over abundance of too much back and forth between locations.The artwork was really well done for the most part, until arriving at the bonus chapter. Ugh. It was a letdown to have moved from such lovely environments to something that looked like the devs dragged out a game from the 80's and reconstituted it (think flat illustration style).  It really had no connection with TSO3, other than the baby griffin and that some of the puzzles that had obviously been dropped in were of the same quality of work as in the main game. Disorienting and disappointing.  So unless you are an Achiev0phile, the bonus chapter can easily be skipped, or tucked away for a rainy day when you don't want to dip into your steam wallet but want a quick play with your morning coffee.Main game worth picking up -- bonus chapter not so much.  All in all, a nice HOG, and worth price paid."

In any case i enjoyed this game and I recommend it as a classic casual point and click adventure :). If there are innovations I have not noticed them, but the game itself is quite pleasant, enjoyable and relaxed.ONE MINOR BUG TO REPORT - or pls help me if this is in fact some mistake on my part:HD mode - can't be turned on and it's too complicated to inform people as it's not steam dealing with this. So maybe someone notices my review - there is at least one more reported case in the comm guide. So i'm not worried, just saying if it doesn't work take it out please :)."

It's a decent balance between the actual HO scenes and puzzles/story.I do have a few nits to pick, though... #1 being the awful cuteness of the ""helper"" creatures... it's kind of absurd.  Lesser nits are generally related to the way the stories play fast & loose with various mythological themes.  I realize that this is probably only a concern to those like me who care about authenticity, but since it is me I found it mildly irritating.Overall, though I think that the series Is one of the better choices if you like HOG.  Even better if you can get them on sale!"
