There are only two things I would change.Firstly, I would add the option to turn down the ripples graphical effect as this can get quite distracting. Secondly, I would make the teleporter blocks easier to distinguish between because they can get confusing. Maybe adding different shades of the same colour to sets of portals.Definitely recommended for a (very) thoughtfully designed, graphically impressive and overall great puzzle game!"

Strong design, intuitive controls, smooth gameplay, surreal soundtrack, you name it. The puzzle difficulty is *just right*, so that you can play for hours on end without getting bored.I absolutely love the smoothness of the game's controls, and how easy it is to move around (once you get the hang of it). The backgrounds and audio are very relaxing, inviting you to move at your own pace. The design of the blocks is another plus, carrying just enough detail to look unique, yet not enough to ruin the minimalistic style.If you like simple, intuitive, or innovative games, I'd strongly recomming trying out ZeGame."

Nice replay values and theoretically endless fun through the level editor.The only thing I'd probably like to change would be the reset of deaths in a level if you restart it while playing (it just feels a little unneccessary going out of the level completely to play it w/o any deaths).Still a 10/10 puzzle game."

,Recommended,437520,23248271,"Posted: 28 May, 2016",all,MrRedstoneWolf,"ZeGame is a super cool puzzle game in 3D!In the beginning are the levels simple but it will get really hard after a while and if it is still too simple you can play it in blind mode.And you can create your own levels and you can play levels that are made by other people.I would recommend that you try the demo and if you think it is something for you, then you should buy it!The music is nice but after a while it can hurt your ears a bit.8/10"

,Recommended,437520,23270111,"Posted: 29 May, 2016",all,Thorin,This game is addicting. But really cool. You are a green block and you have to  get to the blue block using the white blocks. A couple of criticisms. The help that shows you the way to go isn't always accurate so you can die alot. And I would love a level selector. So my friends can play when they are on my computer.

Itriedto like this game (I like almost all puzzle games) and it says I played for two hours, but oh, it sure felt like longer: I found this game to be crazy boring! I did not find it challenging, as I spent most of my time pulling the screen around, trying to see which line on the grid my ball was in, and the rest of my time was spent going: ""okay... I tried up-up-down-right, so this time I'll try up-up-down-left."" The only thing I liked on this game was the music.It is not abadgame, It's just one I did not enjoy. Wish I'd tried to demo first."

All the elements and the style of the game cooperate perfectly with each other.Jesper has created a beautiful game that is truly special. If you're a fan of good puzzle games (like Antichamber, Portal 2 etc.), or of Jesper's previous works then I highly recommend this game to you.Also the name is great, amirite?"
