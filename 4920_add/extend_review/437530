The computer automated voice in the beginning is horrid. It is amazingly annoying and almost made me want to stop playing the game. After I got throught the tutorial it became fun. Just get through the beginning and the rest is extremely fun and I am having a great time playing it so far. Its fun to just close my eyes and listen. Very creative game. I can say for the first time in a long time that this is something I have not experienced before in a game. That to me is worth the 5$ I paid8/10-2  becuase they should have just gotten a voice actor to do the job of the computer voice. Hell the dev should have just done it.Everything else is great so far."

I can overlook listening to my daughter character repeating the same directions over and over again. I can't however accept that I'm fighting a troop of knights, who thankfully have some variant in their voice and personality, but still have the same attack and death sound. I know this is just nitpicking, but it just feels extremely lazy, especially since sound plays such an important role in the game.Another problem I had with the game is that it actively tries to stop you from getting immersed. The Tutorial/Guide voice is very annoying and there was no option in the settings to disable it. It really sucks when you took the time to blindfold yourself in a dark room and covered your ears with a decent pair of headphones and your adventure is ruined by a semi-robotic female voice going “LOADING”.Mechanics wise, it's ok. They were creative in painting the world around you. The sound of your footstep change depending on where you are, the background noises are often filled with subtle sounds to make the world seem alive. Utilizing the daughter character as a marker was also a smart workaround to enable players to move around the game world. However, the maneuvering could use a little tweaking. You could take a wrong turn, and on asking your daughter where to go, she will simply repeatedly tell you to TURN RIGHT. You’re better off playing it by ear, and try to get closer to her voice. Controls are responsive but the combat system felt a bit too simple. The story isn’t too bad and your daughter sounds like a cute girl, so things are probably pretty good.Overall, if you’re looking to just sate a curiousity, then this game would probably be enough to sate it (and the price point is quite fair). However, if you were unfortunately looking to put yourself in the shoes of a blind knight, you will have to look elsewhere."

A video game I play with my aural system not my occular system? Foolishness. But yeah, nah, it's actually solid and really easy to pick up once you get going. I see a lot of pro and con lists in the comments so I'll jump on that bandwagon:Pros:Blindfolding yourself to play a video game is such a unique experience and personally I enjoyed the new medium to paint the world around me with audio instead of visuals.The voice acting is bloody firm.The ambient sounds that make the areas feel alive are beautifully done.Hearing your daughter's voice shout ""Over here"" for the nth time isn't grating, strangely.The combat is interesting, sure it's the same thing over and over again but the pattern recognition is pretty fun.Neutral:It's short. like 2.5 hours short, probably even faster if you're actually good at games, unlike myself. This is both good and bad and I'll talk more about it below these lists.If you do happen to watch the screen during the fight scenes, on a successful hit the screen flashes, good because it shows a successful hit, reaaaaally bad if you've been blind folded for an hour and your eyes are just readjusting to the light.Cons:That f**king robot voice, man. It makes me want to go on a quest for vengance, just like Blake.There's no variation in the death sounds.Hits don't always connect when they should (Although I suspect this will be addressed in a future patch)Random deaths. I mean, like I mentioned before, I'm a visciously average gamer, so it could just be that I suck. But on two or three occasions I like straight up died. I get why, in hindsight it makes sense but (SPOILER)There's one scene where your daughter shouts ""Over here"" and I ran straight toward here and was insinerated by a geizer- So yeah, the length is good and bad, it's good because after 2.5 hours of sitting there with your eyes closed and not going to sleep your eyes get bored and wander all over the shop, making you sleepy, plus for £3.99 I didn't exactly expect 40 hours of gameplay. It's bad because even though the story gets wrapped up nicely, I kinda wanted more, I wanted to at least walk Blake home after how hard he got f**ked because of me, least I could do.---------------------------------------Is it worth your money?Ye.It's alright.Perfect 5/7.It's less than a fiver and it's longer than a movie at the cinema (and like 4 times cheaper)."

It has a peculiar concept and I usually promote this kind of experimentation, even if the game is not a masterpiece. Howeveer, in this case, after the surprise of the unique game mechanics wear off, nothing great remains from it. It becomes incredibly repetitive: there are only two phases, the combats and the running, and both are super tedious. In the combat phases, you only have to wait for the right signal to hit where the sound comes from; in the running phases, you move straightforward, and you press madly on space to call your daughter so that she tells you where to go. The latter is particularly confusing, and will get you lost often.None of this sounds fun, and it quickly becomes annoying. The worst part is that there are too few checkpoints, so you sometimes have to play again a huge section of the game when you die. No thanks: it wasn't fun the first time, I certainly won't do it again.A lot of reviews point out how bad the audio is. Maybe it was because my expectations were low, but it wasn't that bad in my opinion (at least, it wasn't terrible). It's true though you'd expect a game that relies only on sounds to put everything in its audio experience.I find it hard to leave a game unfinished, but it's been a few weeks since I last played (I reached at least the middle of the game), and I just can't find the will to continue."
76561198096079278,Recommended,437530,23814809,"Posted: 25 June, 2016",all,FriendFive,"This game is brilliantly executed-- a truly unique gaming experience. This is a video game without any video. I recommend a good set of headphones and a controller (I use an Xbox 360 controller). Also, I just play with my eyes closed as well instead of looking at the smoky screen. The game flashes the screen when you successfully make an attack with your sword and I can see the flashes with my eyes shut. For a game like this, if the voice acting or sound effects were bad, it would ruin everything. Fortunately, everything sounds great and your imagination fills in everything that is going on around you."
76561198114700189,Recommended,437530,22512059,"Posted: 19 April, 2016",all,jiriho,"Definitly worth a go!This game is pretty cool, and if you have good headphones, especially virtual 7.1 surround sound ones, give this game a go. I used my Razer Kraken 7.1  Chroma headphones, and oh was it awesome. I could tell exactly where those mercenaries, wolves, and that one bear near the beginning that were all trying to kill me were. The ambient sounds that make up the ""scenery"" were also excellent. And this was just in a few minutes of playing the game. (I basically gushed over how awesome this was, then got out of the game to write a review. Also, this is my first review, so I apologize if I messed up the formating or anything like that.) I haven't tried it with other headphones yet, but the sound was amazing with 7.1 headphones. However, there are some things to take into consideration.Pros:An experience like no other ever presented in a video game.The voice acting is pretty good, so far it hasn't bothered me at all.The sounds are phenomenal.The combat is pretty interesting, when I first saw this, I was thinking ""How do you fight?"", but they answer this question by making the sound of the attack prompt you when to strike. Kinda like a QTE, but with no visual prompt.NeutralIt's pretty short, so depending on how good you are, it could go by pretty quickly.It can take a little while to learn when to strike in combat, some players might get a little frustrated with it.Cons:At least in English, the robotic voice can be pretty annoying. This may push some people away from the game, as it can break the immersion.For those people who really dislike QTE games, the combat could turn them off, as it's basically an sound version of a QTE.The death sounds are pretty similar, there's not much difference between them.All in all, I recommend A Blind Legend mostly for the experience. It's just so unique compared to pretty much every other game out there, not to mention fun. If you have good headphones, just buy it. You won't regret it. And even if you don't have the nicest headphones, just give it a whirl for the expereience. It's definitly worth your money."
,Not Recommended,437530,28855904,"Posted: 30 December, 2016",all,Surprise Feudalism,"A Blind Legend is a decent tech demo for audio gaming, but it's uninspired. The protagonist's voice actor gives the standard fantasy plot a good effort; however, the rest of the performances are bland at best, and at worst they become outright obnoxious as characters recite their lines every time you fail and have to replay a section. The overall sound design isn't bad, but it isn't hard to list games that did better soundscapes while also having graphics.There are two kinds of gameplay: navigating the world using positional audio and quick-time cues, and using positional audio to swing your sword at whoever is loudly assaulting you until they expire horribly. The lack of variety becomes tiresome, without much to differentiate your first bandit fight from the final boss.Overall, A Blind Legend gets an A for trying something new, but a C for effort."
,Not Recommended,437530,23323639,"Posted: 1 June, 2016",all,-Johan-,"Playing without visuals is a very interesting mechanic, and occasionally it did work well. However, there is a very limited amount of different sounds (so you end up pushing buttons in response to whether the sound is to your left or right), and fighting is quite annoying. I gave up the game after I tried to defend some fishermen who had saved me - I simply wasn\'t sure if I was even hitting the monster, and I always ended up dying. Note that this means that I have not finished the game.You can try the game\'s first levels out for free on your smartphone to get a feel for it, which I recommend. Playing on PC shouldn\'t add much to the experience."
,Not Recommended,437530,22301667,"Posted: 8 April, 2016",all,Carlz0r,"Quick thoughts on my experience so far.. It's an interesting game, but it's not that great. Here's why.1. The robot voice that tells you how to play is annoying.. it seems to speak less and less as you play, but it completely takes me out of the experience every time it pipes up.  If there must be a voice speaking to me, the player, at least make it a real voice. This is the worst thing so far.2. There isn't a big enough variety of sounds.. for a game that is 100% based on sound, it kinda annoys me that the thugs that attacked me made the same noises every time they were going to hit me, and the same sound every time I hit them... wolves have the same noises every time they run up, attack, and get hit as well.   It needs at least a few different versions of each sound.. both for variety, and challenge.3.  It's really hard to determine how much you're turning.. Too easy to under- or over-estimate.  Even when using the sounds around me as clues, This is still a bit of a problem.  Limitation of the hardware and controls, I suppose.Other than that, it's pretty alright I guess.  It's an interesting experiment.  I don't think this is the first time I've played something like this, but it's certainly a rarity in any case.Would I recommend it?  I'm going to hit ""no"" only because I think the vast majority of people out there won't really be into it, and because of the flaws listed above..  But if you're the type of person, like me, who likes to try interesting stuff (or if you're actually blind) go for it."

I hope the developers continue to develop the format of interactive auditory entertainment both for the vision impaired and non-impaired alike. It can be a little like an audiobook coming to life which allows the player to use their imagination more. Certaintly worth developing more, and I hope other developers begin adding to the format as well."

By giving you only audio to inform you what is happening around you it leaves the visuals completely up to your own imagination - so if you're an avid bookworm then you should enjoy this game. Play it with your eyes closed and it becomes completely immersive. Also, incredible to create a game that raises awareness of a disability and at the same time uses it to make the game better.TL;DR - if you enjoy reading lots then this game is perfect for you.

I'm not that type of a guy who needs to have a public opinion on everything.And maybe just that is the reason why I immediately fell in love with this game. I haven't had an opportunity to really get into it yet, but I already can say for sure that this game is worth trying, even if for the few minutes in the beginning that show you how the world works. It's something quite different compared to most of other games, and I also think it's somehow nice and symbolic that an entirely audio-based game was made basically at the moment of the dawn of VR, which is focusing mainly on visuals, of course.By the way, there's a quick summary down at the bottom. :)But to compare the subjects more, I think this game has similar kind of issues that VR games are having right now. The visuals in VR aren't quite as perfect as on PC's... But thanks to it's mindblowing space complexity, it doesn't matter. And this game, A Blind Legend, has similar issues with the audio. The complexity of the sounds is well thought out and made, as you can say from other reviews and also from getting even only 5 minutes into the game. But the semi-robotic voice everybody here is talking about is very disturbing, as is the repetitiveness of certain phrases and noises made by characters in the game (although this isn't as bad, one can get over it relatively well with a bit of tolerance and generosity). But I would say that this could be the potential start of another kind of games (and I might be wrong here, but I've never heard of a game played entirely by audio before, so I'm sorry if I put wrong information in this review), which could expand and improve over time. And that's awesome, come on. :)If I would recommend this game... I'm gonna hit yes. Mainly it's because of my opinion that nobody should refuse to try a new thing, that doesn't do anything bad or wrong to anybody. Trying new things moves you forward. And this is just an interesting concept, and I'm sure it will never fit everybody; after all, no game has ever accomplished that yet. But it's certainly worth trying, despite the awful robovoice of the guide and other imperfections. The experience this game will give you far exceeds the experience of many AAA titles, which is caused mostly by them being generic and not interesting at any aspect. These high-end, high-cost games won't bring you anything new, but it will be perfect if the only thing you want is to stay in your comfort zone.A Blind Legend won't give you that. It probably won't even be the most ground-breaking game you played, even if you don't play many games. But it will give you an another point of ""view"", an another potential way... and I think that's what is really important. If you don't like it, it's fine, everybody has his own opinion, no matter how hard passionate review writers try to sound convincing. But who knows, maybe it won't be that bad after all. :)Put simply: A Blind Legend is worth trying out, if you're only a tiny little bit willing to step out of your comfort zone and try something new and unusual (or well, probably not new and unusual to everybody. But for me it certainly was new :).It has its flaws, I would never argue with that. The robotic voice of the guide is disrupting the experience a lot. But I'm sure this and other flaws can be worked on in the future, and even now they don't affect the game too hard.You might not like it after all, and that would be perfectly understandable. I can't make you think what's good or bad, and frankly, nobody should. But I can give you my opinion, and you might listen to me and take something out of it. And that would be completely worth the hour I spent writing this review.I will say it one last time: Try it out, hear for yourself and make your own opinion. ;)"

I do wish that the story was a little more fleshed out, and that there were more audio files so your daughter and the enemies had a bit more to say, but in general this is an interesting step into a niche market for gaming that I would like to see develop,I could only imagine what would happen if there was a six to seven hour long story with extremely immersive audio and different music to bring tones to the story.  I would like to imagine this game sort of like a great book.  It is up to you to create the world and ponder what monsters you are fighting, the epic environments, and your characters appearance.All being said I would say pick up this game if you want to try something different.

As you walk, you hear the life around you, and I have been scratching my head trying to figure out how they achieved something so spectacular.The couple of criticisms I DO have are fairly moot at the moment, as I haven't entirely finished the game. I think this game is a proof of concept of something that could flourish into an entirely unique genre of gaming. I can only imagine how INCREDIBLE this would be with the Occulus or the Vive's headtracking, turning your ears to listen to foes, and truly being surrounded by a world. Combat is fairly simple at the moment, but I think there is a LOT that could be done to make it more challenging and interesting.
