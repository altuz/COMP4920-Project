I do agree with the other reviews saying that the game's a bit repetitive, and I think if I hadn't gotten it on sale I'd be a bit annoyed, but as-is I feel I more than got my money's worth. What it does, it does very well, and finding cool combinations of heads, weapons, and secondaries adds a lot of fun to the game.You're probably not gonna sink dozens of hours into this, but it's a fun little diversion with really nice art and music."

Instead of opting for the usual pixel graphics seen in roguelikes, the team behind this has gone with a truly unique style that's colorful and immediately likable.The gameplay, however, could be better. My first complaint is that the controls should be a little tighter than they are. In a game where you face rooms full of enemies and you may have to bounce on multiple enemies' heads to defeat them, having the additional challenge of fighting imprecise controls is one thing I could do without.I'm particularly annoyed with the mechanic where, when an enemy damages you, all your stuff (skull, gun, item) bounces away from you and you have to retrieve it. On numerous occassions I took damage from an enemy, only causing my character to drop everything I had into the map, leaving me completely defenseless with no way to retrieve anything.I'm also annoyed that the game explains nothing but its controls when you begin to play. My first several times playing the game left me thinking ""Wait... why did I die?"" or ""Wait... why am I not dead?"" because it was never made clear that your health is tied to your skull, and you need to retrieve it to avoid dying.Overall, it's an okay game, but the things I explained above left me so annoyed that I just don't want to play it anymore."

The core gameplay is very straight forward and leaves a decent amount of lot of room for experimentation in terms of weapons loudouts. However, the game is pretty repetitive but the relative difficulty somewhat balances it out. If you're into the constant grind of better your highscore, simple straightforward gameplay mechanics, great artsyle and music, fast paced platforming and shooting this is worth trying out."
76561197997530228,Recommended,437570,30605709,Posted: 18 March,all,loliconomics,"GoNNER is a game I give a very qualified reccomendation. It's yet another indie-procedurally generated-permadeath-sidescrolling-action-platformer with a quirky artstyle. The saturation of these sorts of games in recent years has become tiring, and while GoNNER has some differentiating elements, it falls into a lot of the same pitfalls other games of the genre do. It's an enjoyable game, but it still has a lot of room for improvement.GoNNER has a very simple premise. Run, jump, shoot and use items to get to the end of the level. Every 4 levels there's a boss, beat the boss to continue to the next world. Lose and you have to start the run all over. Starting a run you essentially choose a ""loadout"" of a Mask (which serves as your health pool and gives you passive bonuses like a third jump or reduced cooldowns), a weapon, and an item that can be used on a cooldown to give you more ammo or give you temporary invincibility. Anytime you take damage your stuff drops and you enter a state where you are invincible and sort of flop around so you can try and get your stuff back. Since your Mask acts as your health bar, getting hit without it is an instant kill. Other masks, items and weapons will appear the levels and at stores where you can pay gylphs to buy new items, ammo, health and other useful things. Gylphs are currency found in some hidden areas, but are primarily aquired by comboing, every 5 enemies killed within a short period of time gets you a gylph and the more you combo the more gylphs you get. Gylphs are also used to revive you if you die, the cost increasing as you get further into the game as well as with each revival.Compared to a lot of roguelites, the amount of items and the balancing is very different. There are only about 8 of each type and they are all more or less balanced to be equal, meaning you can beat the game with any set of items and, once you find a loadout you like, you don't have to look for or buy new ones unless you lose them by dropping them. This reduces the reliance on RNG to win that a lot of roguelites have, where getting good items makes or breaks a run. The only variables for winning are level layouts, knowledge and skill. On one hand I like this a lot because it makes it more like a classic sidescroller, where you just have to improve to win and can't rely on lucky drops to win or blame unlucky drops when you lose. But even though they are theoretically balanced, certain items in my experience rise to the top.By default you can only shoot straight left or right, meaning in order to hit enemies above or below you have get to their level. This becomes a serious problem in the second world which features large amounts of flying enemies and enemies on walls postioned above or below you. The randomly generated nature of the game creates massive chokepoints where it's incredibly difficult to go through or around enemies hitting you at all angles. This problem is exacerabated by the introduction a bottomless death pit which can not only kill you instantly if you get hit, but also cause you to lose your items permanently if you don't have the retrieval skull. The only items really able to counter this safely are the the triple jump mask, which also allows you to rotate in midair allowing diagonal shots, and the usable item that allows you to detonate explosions in a ring around you. The only other ways to get around this is to use the rocket launcher weapon, which has the weird tendency to hit the ground in front of you when fired, as well as the mask that causes enemies to explode on death, which is extremely unpredictable due to the physicy nature of the game. Later levels don't get much better. The increased enemy count adds to the unpredictablity and increase the need for you to rely on tools that hit at an angle.More positively, GoNNER's biggest strength is its feel. Art in Heart and Raw Fury ultilize the Vlambeer suite of little tricks and effects to make simple gameplay feel fun and responsive to play. Jumping, shooting, and killing enemies all have a satisfying weight and pop to their animation and sound. The art style is colorful and quirky, but readable even when there's tons of action on screen. The soundtrack is almost silent when not engaging enemies, but kicks in as you fire. And it only gets better as you combo. Comboing adds a new stem to the music and every five more kills in a combo speeds up and increases the volume of soundtrack. Death effects are louder. Controller vibration gets stronger. Combo high enough and the color palatte will start rhythmically shifting to the music, changing permanently when you stop the combo. All these little effects encourage you to take risks and fight faster to get a higher combo and get a higher score. It's an ingenious system that unfortunately suffers because the rest of the game is mediocre.There other weird small decisions that hamper the game. For example, after the end of each world, you meet or whale buddy who rewards you with an item. If you have don't have full health, she fills you up and gives you a sort of skull option that retreives your items when you get hit. But if you are full, she upgrades your weapon to have more max ammo. Because of the problems mentioned above about item recovery, the skull is far more useful generally, since the upgraded weapon can easily be lost when you get hit or die. In addition, if you combo to the point where the colors change, you are rewarded with a different skull that retrieves gylphs for you. But if you have this skull which you meet the whale, even if you have low health you won't get the retrieval skull. In both instances, this feels like the game punishing you for doing well. Another weird aspect is that the level sort of forms around your character as you walk forward. This is a cool effect, but it can sometimes be a nuisance because you are unable to see what's ahead of you until you get close enough. In terms of bugs, the only thing I found was that if I fired while exiting a level, the pushback would carry over to the next  and sometimes push me outside the bounds of the level, forcing me to kill myself to procede.I like GoNNER, but it's a rough game. I reccomend it because I think there's potential. I believe this is the developers' first commercial project, so they have room to get better in the future. They obviously know how to make satisfying action, so if they refine the mechanics and design they could really make something special. Personally I would like to see something with set level design instead of random generation. Where you're given specific tools to overcome a specific obstacle.  Something that feels well crafted."

The game looks fantastic.Add to that a fast, atmospheric soundtrack, some tight controls, a bunch of different pickups to add replayability and you have a great platformer.The game can be pretty tough at the beginning but once you figure the different enemys out it gets more and more fun.Highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys platformers."

Its great, honestly one of the best games at this price point this year. GoNNER is a Roguelike platformer with a unique and pretty artstyle. The sound design is also well done. But what really surprised me is how polished and well done the gameplay is. Its challenging without being frustrating, and gives you enough power that you can win with the right skill. Combo's are pretty essential, and excecuting them is pretty rewarding and fun. The ""story"" of the game from what I can tell is about helping your big whale friend. Its really not important though, the gameplay and the sound/art design carry this game to being great in my opinion.Its october so a lot of big AAA games are coming out, but if your like me and really can't afford them, and your into roguelikes and platformers, you'll dig GoNNER.

The whole combo system is great and really keeps you coming back for more to get further, and get a higher score. So, ok here are theessentials:1. You can jump on enemies to kill them2. You can shoot them; there are different guns as persistent unlocks that you can start your runs with3. There are different 'backpacks' that modify things; these are also persistent and you choose what you start with4. There are different heads that give you different abilities and different amounts of life; same rules as above5. If you get hit, generally all of the above gear breaks apart and you have a quick chance to grab it, else you die6. Combos earn you 'money' which you can spend at small shops or on extra lives7. There are secrets!The dark ambience is beautiful and the music and sound effects really work together to build a cool little universe. Controller support and keyboard work well (there is no mouse, here).Pros:+Masterfully done mechanic that is hella addictive+The music and art and sound effects work togetherreallywell+Very very addicting+Controller support is great, and almost a must for those on the fence (I would say you need one if you want to really compete)Cons:-Not many that I have found so far; while I have unlocked a fair number of items, I'm hoping there are lots more - but that remains to be seen-Needs Steam Cloud implemented (they say it is coming soon, though)Totally worth full price for fans of action roguelites."

For every region you will always encounter the exact same enemies in the same constellations. Also after you know what build you like the most, you`ll play with that build for the entire game, maybe until you find something new that you like better. But doing runs in this game feels a little bit like waste of time. The game is fun, but it could really need some character progression.

The visuals are impressive, and the minimalistic storytelling coupled with Tim Burtonesque ""cute but spooky"" artstyle gave me an excellent first impression.Then I got into playing. And the fun stopped immediately.The hitboxes on this game are going to make you want to throw away your controller.And whenever you get hit, you lose all your gear and... The invincibilty frame last for 0.05 sec. Meaning a second hit you die. But since everything flies away randomly when you get hit, there's no way to know where your character is... And when you pick your weapon again, it doesn't work right away... FUNFirst level is almost manageable except... You keep looking for a way to shoot up. Everything seems to made for you to be able to shoot up in terms of level design. Ennemies are almost always higher than you can reach with your double-jump. But the first level is in closed space so you get used to wall jumping and as long as you can avoid being ganked by a group of ennemies, it's almost fun (heads-up : you're going to have to replay it, every single time)But level 2 is ridiculous. Suddenly you're out in open areas, with pits and flying ennemies high above you, and disappearing platforms, and it's almost manageable if you get lucky. But then comes the boss... Which is a gank fest...I've had less of a hard time clearing Cotton Alley on SMB...And finally, the game sucks horribly at teaching you to play it. You get random items, which are 99% of the time, worse than your start load. You can't try them out without sacrificing said load for the entire playthrough.

The control scheme in the game feels tight, which is important as it features a nice mix of shooting, dodging and stomping on heads. Similar to the likes of Nuclear Throne, each run is relatively short essentially meaning you do not have to donate a large amount of time just to get results.In comparison to some other games from the genre, the item & weapon pool feels quite small, but is extremely well balanced. Each item gets equipped into 3 different slots (head, back and weapon) so this allows you to interchange between items and weapons and find the best synergy or combo, adding a lot more depth to your choices.If you enjoy fast paced combat and shooting things, with the ever looming threat of ""permadeath?"" hanging over your every move and a lot of replayability, definitely pick up this game.Oh yeah, the sound design, art style and music is really great too."

In a nutshell I'd call it ""challenging, yet rewarding"". As you'd expect from anything claiming to be a roguelike, you die, a lot. But in GoNNER this doesn't feel so much of a punishment, because with almost every play through you unlock something new, or discover some trick you hadn't noticed before (you can spin after jumping with the bear head!).If you're into roguelikes, enjoy a challenge, or just want to support an indie developer that is making all the right choices, this title is worth every cent.

Even the soundtrack is worth it. It is delightfully odd and obtuse; it does not hold your hand or tell you how anything works. This is not a bad thing, and I have not felt as much as joy as I have accidentally figuring out what some items do while involuntarily murdering scores of beautiful neon pixels. Even the game description is obtuse and totally sold the game to me.The points system and high-score leaderboard make me feel like a kid at the arcade again.

It's a similar concept in the roguelike genre with an emphasis on racking up combos for score.There are unlockable weapons, heads, and items.  All have an effect on gameplay.  Weapons range from pistols to laser beams and items do various things such as refilling your ammo to invincibility.  Heads determine your health and each one has unique traits, such as triple jumping, floating, extra health, or firing an extra bullet.  As you unlock these pieces of gear, you'll be able to choose them to create customized loadouts at the beginning of each game.On the subject of health, this game has a unique mechanic that can create some interesting situations.  You drop all held items upon taking damage, including your weapon and head.  If you get hit again before grabbing your head, you will die.  Sounds rough, but managing to survive after all your gear falls down a pit is really satisfying.Music and sound is on point and the beeps and boops give a really unified feel with the graphical style of the game."

At the current moment I think I'll refund my purchase and buy the soundtrack on bandcamp. Here's my gripes with the game, in no particular order:Crypticity.Ok, I love crypticity and games with it. I even love it when certain games require crypticity to win. But the keyword iscertaingames. It really grinds my gears when a game like this or binding of isaac makes every item a complete mystery to what it does, especially since there's permadeath. Why take any risk? I don't know what any of this crap the merchant is selling is, and even if I buy it, it doesn't tell me what it is either. When I do try to buy something, it seems straight up worse than what I have currently or feels like it has no effect. Everything probably has a purpose, but i'm not going to reduce my health by two notches halfway through my run just to question what it did. Either you look up a wiki and spoil the fun, or have the game slap you around a bit until you forcefully learn everything it wants you to. This is especially stressed because...The Game Is Too Hard And Not In The Fun Way.It feels like the developer at points is trying to make it hard, especially since it calls itself ""tough as hell"". The main problem here is that there is simply too many enemies on the screen at all times. I think the trailer and some screenshots do it justice- but just imagine that a lot of those enemies take 2-3 hits to kill depending on the weapon and they all move at different speeds and have different AI. You walk into a room in the first world even and there is just a ton of crap everywhere and you kind of just spray and pray because you just bought the game and have no idea what the strategy for dealing with this massive wall of meat is, if there even is one. Even the boss fights are just rooms filled with a boss (two, for the first one at least) and a ton of infinitely spawning enemies until you kill them. There's just too much. Hard is fun when you feel like it's a fair challenge or you're being slowly introduced to advanced concepts, and if it's designed around it. This feels like neither- the random enemy generation feels like the computer is abusing the copy paste tool and you are thrust right in.Jumping Feels A Bit Off.Not really much to say for this one, but it's a surprisingly big issue considering that jumping is sometimes what you need to do to kill enemies. I think the acceleration is a bit off or it's too low, just something about it feels wrong. There's probably an item that ""fixes it"", but it just feels frustrating to deal with vanilla. It's like you're constantly jumping in molasses.But honestly, I don't totally hate this game, I'm just super frustrated it isn't better. It feels like all of these cool assets and amazing music got wasted on a totally generic trying to be hard roguelike when it could have been made into something a lot better. I love the personality, I love the art, and I absolutely love the music. I just feel like GoNNER wastes that potential."

If you have a little head, that pops off along with ur gun and special after being hit, then when you get hit, you lose everything into either in a pit of enemies or they fall into a death pit and you just get one hit after losing ur head.Literally only downside is no save points.You may argue, if you've played the game, that if you collect enough purple cubes then you can redo the level you died on but after the first boss you'll be lucky to have one retry before starting completly over. Before the first boss you get a retry for about 5 cubes, then after is about 8-10 which is all you could really get."

It's fantastic to quickly pick up and play (and then put down again when you die)What I like -Controls are very responsive and feel tight.The art style is captivating. The passive animations on everything make everything look alive. The colours are vibrant and it is very clear what is and is not an enemy.The combo system is fun and rewards risk, as you will be forced to sometimes give up currency in order to continue a combo. Watching the colours of the world change as you kill makes a god combo all the more exciting,Text, or lack thereof. Having no text to speak of aside from the menus gives the game a comic style, as emotions and abilities are shown through visual flair instead of descriptions.The little interactions between objects.Like the ball backpack and playing with Sally.These little extra touches add so much interest to an already compelling gameplay.Weekly updates!What I don't like -Walls being invisible unless you are near them can screw you over sometimes with regards to combos and pitfallsWhen you are hit in the middle of a bunch of enemies, it is very difficult to see where you are and can go.Environment variety is a thing I feel is lacking. You could put it down to art style, but personally I really don't like that within certain areas, rooms look identical.Lack of variety is a big problem. There are very few guns, heads and backpacks to choose from at the moment. This issue is being resolved via updates, but at the time of this review it does not feel like you encounter enough items to cause a playstyle change mid run.Pitfalls where you cannot see the walls feel very unfair. Furthermore, having your gear dropped down a hole also feels similarly unfair.Honestly though, the issues I have are mostly easily resolved. Even if the game was in pixel art I'd still reccomend it for the smooth gameplay and tight controls.I look forward to future updates from this indie gem and I wish the dev the best of luck in finding this game an audience."

Nicely produced, nicely thought out and dynamic. The graphics are cute but the environments and enemies lack variety...this game looks and feels the same very quickly unlike Isaac or Gungeon whereby the variety keeps you going. The biggest negative for this game is the mystery is attempts to utilise. It wants to be unknown and it wants to be hard and challenging. No clue as to what the controls are in game...no idea what the pickups do...no understanding of the mechanics like comboing and min maxing...it's up to you, if you have the patience, to get your head around what you need to do. Unlike Isaac that clearly points out to you how to move, shoot and use bombs this game thinks you love not knowing and dying lots. I'll keep my opinions to my self in regards to the first boss level...i have sworn a lot so far and have gotten quite annoyed but i will persist for a while longer...EDIT: This game is so annoying i can't put it into words...could be great but instead it just goes out of it's way to restrict and annoy you. And man o man do i hate how most enemies are always just out of sight. you rely on double jumping ALL the time. having 360 directional shooting would have been a blast but no...you can only shoot left and right.

Despite the game's inital charm, it will quickly lose the player's interest upon the discovery of the sheer lack of variety in enemies and level generation. The soundtrack is phenomenal. The potential is there. However, the game falls short in reaching the extent of its potential come the 8th or 9th run. Additionally, this game has not seen an update in well over 6 months, and from what I've seen thus far I don't believe that it will be seeing another one anytime soon. To the potential consumer: save your money and take it elsewhere lest it is solely for the aesthetic."
,Recommended,437570,33980041,Posted: 2 August,all,KNIVSPARK,"CONCLUSION - This playful, quirky rogue-lite is scratching that ""Nuclear Throne"" and/or ""Binding Of Isaac""-itch delivering challenging gameplay in a charming universe. I'm at almost 5 hours of gameplay now and get the feeling that this is a game that I will play for at least 20+ hours if not more, and for the price tag of 9,99€ I'd say it's a bargain!FIRST IMPRESSION - I started playing but was at first frustrated, NOT because the game was hard (which is to be expected of a roguelite and I enjoy the challenge) but rather of the lack of explanation for ANYTHING really. No tutorial, descriptions of any powerups or how hp works etc, not a single word/symbol in english or another language in fact.THEN I REALIZED... - the lack of description is a part of the game (and it certainly adds to the aesthetic too). It becomes a search for knowledge, trying out different powerups and see what they do, finding things out for yourself and experimenting, exploring the game world and it's items, weapons, powerups, enemies, and even finding out how the game's mechanics work. Since that realization I have been largely enjoying the game and embraced the unknown things that come my way, trying to figure them out by myself. I suspect this is not something everyone would enjoy, BUT I sure have and continue to do so :)DIFFICULTY - The game offers quite the challenge and death comes often, however I am eager to get back in there and try a new set up of items/weapons/powerups and learn from my mistakes and try once more to reach further than I did before, slowly but surely I am getting better and further and further, and a sense of curious exploration of the game world as well as the welcome challenge keeps me coming back for more!STORY & WORLD DESIGN - The story is weird, but likeable (and kind of cute) if you are into quirky stuff. It is not a masterful storyline I'd say (although I have not beaten it yet) but it sure is a playful universe full of interesting creatures and features!AESTHETIC - The playful, minimalistic artstyle and animation along with the funky, mysterious soundtrack adds up to a really cool atmosphere, and the curious creatures/enemies you encounter are often charming and interesting."

It's beautiful, the sound design is top notch, and most importantly: it's fun as balls. I wouldn't really classify it as a roguelike tbh, but there is some definite replayability if you use different skull/item combos - but the problem is there really isn't much reason to unless you just feel like doing that.You can choose which weapon, skull and pack you start with so no real randomness...and even with all of this I still want to play repeatedly. The game is insanely well made - animations are smooth and unique and the controls are smooth.The only real gripe I have with the game is that in some levels, if you get hit and you're not using a skull that keeps your body together (most Skulls have different attributes or skills attached to them, but make you fall apart if you get hit - so your body has to go collect your items while dodging or bouncing on top of enemies) you can completely lose all your items, which is actually hilarious, because you just have to GIT GUD and either not get hit to begin with, or just bounce on enemies to the next area.Overall, this game is amazing, I think $10 is a bit high, but it didn't stop me from buying it and I highly reccomend you do the same. We need games like these to do well so we can have MORE of them."
