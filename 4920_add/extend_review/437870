The issue isn't it's early stage in development, it's the glaring lack of design work. The main thrust of the game is producing saleable products to fund your colony's growth. There is no support in the UI for this, however.Each building is seperate, so you have to click on each building to view its status. Then for each unit of raw materials you want to produce, you have to click once per unit to add it to the production queue. There's no way to say ""I want to produce these until I say otherwise""; you just have to click hundreds of times. And if it finishes, then you don't get a notification, so make sure you click more times than you need, or resign yourself to checking back periodically. Then, you have to click each manufacturing building to view its status, and if it's not currently manufacturing, you can tell it to produce one manufactured item. No queue there, so just remember to check each factory periodically to see if it's finished with its one item. Then to sell the items, you go into that building and click once for each item you want to sell. If you want to sell fifty units, that's fifty clicks. If you think all that sounds pretty tedious, you'd be right.That the game has reached a playable state with no thought given to how it's going to be played makes me very doubtful that the game will ever fully mature. I'd love to be proven wrong. I am not going to hold my breath, however."

Build the next item... ok.  Need some blocks foor that, but not sure which ones as they are overlaid with a stupid red obscurring blur (because thats always helpful).  When you inevitibly select the wrong blocks, your screwed.  Restart. Try another pair of blocks... ok, I have the blocks, except wait...  that building needs a total of *12* blocks to make the next structure and storage can only hold *10* blocks - becuase math is hard?One wrong mouseclick, you have to restart.  Oh but how could you possibly click the wrong thing?  I'm sure there are tooltips and useful contextual information thruout...  NOPE!  There are some crazy horrible voiceovers in the 'Tutorial' that made me choke on vomit a little, and which were no use at all.  Had to resort to Guess & Click!!  Serioulsy some super simple toolips popping up on hover would help a LOT!

With no direction other than ""place some turrets"" I spread them evenly around the map. Then enemy drop ships landed, and my turrets shot at them. The turrets completely missed their target, but they had no problem mowing down my entire colony with friendly fire (which I was given no warning to watch out for). It took hours to build, and only seconds to destroy. By the time I realized what was happening and thought to take control of my turrets, it was too late - I had too many turrets, and the whole colony is made of tissue paper.It was a real grind to build everything up to the point I'd gotten to. Even if I reloaded my last save, I'd have to figure out how to place turrets to avoid crossfire and also manually control them for every attack. It's just too tedious. I'm honestly not sure how anyone could get through this poor design without saintly patience.Do I recommend this game? Solid No."

However the biggest issue for me was pathing. The mechanics kept getting stuck, so my structures didn't get repaired and were destroyed. Reading the forums, this has been an issue since summer 2016. You can eventually make miners, scientists and utility vehicles, but what's the point, since they're all going ot get stuck anyway, making the game even more unplayable.I spent most of my game time building the items needed to train mechanics, you never have enough. Having to have 2 mechanics per structure is ridiculous, they're slow and take forever to get anywhere (providing you don't have a traffic jam somewhere (pathing!!!!)).Oddly the habitats all connect, but the mechanics can't pass thru them, but rather have to go around them, causing more delays. They tend to lock in place, so you must build them all over the place instead.This game needs a grid so you don't place buildings too close together causing even more pathing issues.Seems to me the most useless building is the launch pad, you don't make any money, so then why would you want to sell anything??Until atleast the pathing is fixed I highly recommend for you to stay away from this game unless you want a lesson in frustration and a lot of wasted gameplay.Update 6/16/2017:Last update was in Sept 2016 adding an overhead view and 3 languages, but no real update since it 's release from EA in July 2016."

It posseses many of the same features but taken to the next level. The layers of crafting are farily intricate. In addition you have the added dimension of a research tree and the problem of managing 3 colonies at a time where each colony is interdependant on the others. Throw that together with the threat of robbers and aliens and you have a game that will keep you entertained for hours.  At the beginning of the game you have ""advisors"" they do a great job at stepping you through some of the beginning phases but the mechanics are designed where you need to be increasingly more creative. This system allows you  to jump right into playing the game with a very easy learning curve. If you don't want to be constrained by the story they also have a sandbox mode. All in all I think this is the best resource game I have played. I think it better even then banished or planet base. One last thing the price point on this game is well worth it.

This game, so far, seems to be nothing more than clicks.  Want to make resources?  Click to make one of ANYTHING, but you only get one per click, so if you want 40, click 40 times.  Or you can just turn on automation and it will keep making things ad infinitum.  There's no ""process"" to make anything.  It's just clicks.  You don't have to send out astronauts to mine ore, you don't have to extract anything from the soil.  Well, maybe you do theoretically, but if you want to go that route, it's all in your imagination.Want to build the more complicated buildings?

Many basic game concepts have not implemented yet, and the players time quickly devolves into an unsustainable amount of micro-management. There's a strong imbalance between what the player must do manually and what is automated behind the scenes. For example:- When building habitation structures, new colonists instantaneously fill the structures regardless of whether or not the colony even has the ability to accept deliveries (extreme and illogical automation)- To construct a new building or object - of which there are many - each unit of material required for construction has to be manually produced by the player (extreme and illogical micromanagement).I hope development continues on this project. It has the foundation to go far."

Well, you better head into the production menu and start the production by clicking 8 times on iron and 4 times on glass. The facilities you build do nothing by themselves.

I can't even imagine how it'll be later, because the game seems to have a ton of different materials/goods to make, which would be a good thing if there was any actual automation in the game.

Housing can for some reason make resources on their own (my ""inflatable habitats"" create Iron, for example). The whole resource gathering aspect here doesn't really seem to make much sense. There are no mines that extract iron from the planet crust, your houses just directly make them (...when you, manually, ask them to). The game also kind of seems like a student project (I made a game myself in Unity during university, and this seems like something a group of 2-4 people could create quite easily in a semester).I'll probably refund it at some point when I can be arsed.Edit: Automation has been added, but I've yet to look into the game again."
,Not Recommended,437870,25556270,"Posted: 17 September, 2016",all,TheSilverHammer,"Where to begin? How about the thing that is really terrible about this game, the UI.I start the tutorial which is OK, and at some point it asks me to build a modular habitat. Up until this point I just clicked on various icons and something would drop from orbit. I saw the habitat, but I could not build it. There is no explanation in the tutorial.So after messing around a bit, I see that I can build a workshop (it is the only thing I can build at this point). So I make it and then try to build a habitat, and I still can't. Then I see that I can hit some automatic build mode thingy, and suddenly the thing starts cranking out a bunch of resources.After a while I can now build the habitat because I have the basic resources I need. OK, so its just a poor tutorial at this point. So then I am instructed to build a few other things, some of which I can, but then I get stuck again because this workshop has produced a bunch of useless stuff and filled up my inventory.I then figure out that I need to delete stuff I do not need to make room, but after I figured this out, an earthquake happens and blows up all of my water and oxygen. There is nothing in the tutorial about this. And so I start over after noticing I can turn that off in the options menu.Anyway here is the gist of why the UI is horrendously bad. So to make some thing, you might need to make 10 iron, 5 glass, 3 wood 6 methane and like 3 gears (which take some amount of iron and titanium each). So you need to make resources for the gears and then make the gears and then make the resources for everything else to plop your building down.You have to do all this manually mind you. So there is this UI which lets you see all the things you can produce and lets you produce things, but it DOES NOT SHOW YOU how much you actually have. IE: You may know that X thing needs 10 iron, but you can't see how much iron you have from that screen.Then there is a screen that shows you how much you have, but you can't produce anything from there. Oh, and you can't see the resources you need from any screen but the info screen on the thing you want to build. So you would need to memorize everything and then manually make everything.If the developer reads this review, you just make to make your UI sane.I would suggest that the colony produces the resources it needs automatically. IE: I want to build a habitat, then I place the thing down, and it automatically makes everything I need.You should also combine the build resources screen with the one showing what you have and then you should also add a storage threshold, so I could say, keep a minimum of 10 iron available at all times.This would go a long way with making your UI much more user friendly. Also please clean up the tutorial, make it show you how to build more complex stuff and certainly go with building maintance and all that. Oh, please use more sensible graphics that fit with the elements they represent. IE: Iron in your UI is a white cube with some tiny dots on it. I would naturally in no way, associate that with iron. How about a stack of iron ingots or steel girders or something that a normal human would look at and think ""Iron"" instead of ""What the heck is that supposed to be?"""

(Laughed really hard when it hit my base, it destroyed something I not really needed, shrugged, moved on ;) )Slowly really need to micromanage everything more and more and is looking good playability feeling wise.Some tooltips can be handy indeed showing what is needed for buildings and sometimes hard to see, but once the modular habitat is up you got a bit more room to wiggle and try out building certain resources."

But as of today (Sept 30, 2016), it's still a work in progress and still unpolished.The mechanics of the game work well but the gameplay isn't very intuitive. Multiple times during the first hours of the game in tutorial/story mode, you're asked to build something and you have no clue how to procure the materials to make it. For me, it involved looking at the item, following the production chain, only to end up needing a raw material you don't where to find.This was fun for the first little bit but after hours of scratching my head, the game ceased to be enjoyable.So, maybe in a few months after the devolopers have polished the gameplay a little more, I'll give it another shot.

The gameplay, as it stands in early access is what you would expect for a colony management game, but I have to say, that aside from a resource crunch now and then, I never really felt that my colony was on the brink of disaster or that a wrong choice could spell ruin for my colonists.The game is, of course, early access, but there still feels to be a lack of content. I am by no means a super gamer, able to chew through a new game in mere minutes, but If you look at my play time, it accurately (as of the date of writing this) depicts how long it took me to go from early tutorial to beating the campaign mode.I'd like to see more planets and colonies both in the campaign and the free-play modes.TLDR: Okay for early access.

But within just a few hours you can complete it.It still is in developement, so I hope they add some other features. Because it is fun and easy.If it remains like this, i would spend only a few $ on it.Pros:+ easy to understand and to learn+ fun, casual game+ short (if you have a few hours to waste)+ just build a lot of factories and workshops. That speeds the game a lot.Cons:- the tutorial doesn't speak of maintenance engineers. It's in the first comodity you build.Very important, coes your buildings detoriate over time.- in the crafting screen you see how much items you need and how much you have.- you need to go to a lot of screens / buildings to make just 1 item. (example: build a hotel. You need suits. go to crafting. Oh yeah, rubber comes from other planet, ...)- the asteroid has defence against asteroids, but the 2 planets dont?- if you go from 1 planet to another, the first one pauses. So if you have to produce a hughe quantity of resources, you just have to wait at that planet. You can't go to another planet to kill time.possible enhancements (for lazy people :)):* More text and info for each material please. Like for the turrets gun / rocket / laser. what's the difference?* More text and info for each worker please. In the housing department you can see the miner guy, but you do not know why you need him. At the left bottom you have an overview of your workers and there you see they automatically mine things. Things that you need to finish the game.* Great you have an overview of your inventory and production. But it would be better if you have both of them in 1 screen. Like: Iron ore 'x' / 'y' (x = amount currently produced, y = amount currently in your storage area). So you could easier see which items you still need.* Same thing for the crafting and personal please.* In the game the relationship between Mars and earth seems so important, but you can't send anything to Earth or ask anything from Earth. That might be something to work on.* You get attacked by another 'company'. Why can't you send attacks / troopers to them? It might extend the time to end the game.* At the first planet (Mars) you do not have all the available space to build on. You have to stay away from ±10% of the borders.Conclusion:With some extra features and hours to play this could be a great game.For now don't spend too much money on it."

The buildings lack a lot of flavor and looks very ugly. A building called the launch pad for example, is just a box with a box roof and a little rocket inside. There are no resources, you just build a building and it automatically produces resources for the next tier of buildings. The buildings require maintenance and sometimes the maintenance workers get stuck trying to get to the building to repair it. Luckily they just start repairing from where they are, but only after a significant amount of time has passed.

IT takes a few hours to learn how to get the balance right, so I'd say you'd get oh 6-15 hours of fun from this game. Not bad if you buy it on Special, which I did. The game looks OK too."

And more hassle being told i need to put a terraform base down, you just end up putting stuff down all over the place so its one big mess, graphics and sound is ok but constantly having to rush to get the buyildings down then finding you need more and more makes the game unplayable and boring once its more developed it may become a good game but do not buy it until more work has been done unless your happy to run  round in circles like a headless chicken"

Once you learn you need to craft almost from the beginning to keep from getting broke it became easy. Keep up the good work Dev's. :)

Unclear on how to proceed given that I see no option to complete the first objective and cannot build anything.  Tried sandbox mode.  Same issue.  Ugh...UPDATE:If this happens to you just make sure the tutorial is activated in options since this didn't seem to be a default.  It is a rather interesting game and I can't wait to make more time for it.

I had planned to play for an hour and then play some Stellaris.  Those plans were shot to sh*t when I realized I had been playing for 7 hours.  Beware you may lose a significate portion of time into the game after you start playing.  With any games coming out of Early access there are still some bugs and general issues, but honestly they are things that will likely be fixed in short order.This is a fun city type building game that is well worth the price.  If you like this stuff get it."

Why can it make 'antimony'? How in the world do they just 'make iron' once I have built a slightly larger housing structure? Are they just making it in a bucket? It makes no sense!While we're on that subject, why can't I have more than one window open? I'd like to be able to see what materials a building needs so I can queue those up, but as soon as I try to open the production window the building window vanishes. Why? Why not just let me queue all needed materials up with one click on the building?The tutorial gives you a few open objectives without explaining how to do anything. Not a problem for me, might be an issue for others.Overall this feels nothing like a space colonization game. It feels more like a clicky mobile game with fancier graphics and no depth."

Like, no challenge at all. At no point in the short time I played it did I feel like my base was under any sort of threat nor any point in continuing to play. Combine that with a frankly annoying interface and the fact the game has zero personality I have to say no. Money back plz."

,Recommended,437870,28961565,Posted: 2 January,all,JayJane4,"TLDR;While the story is lacking, the mechanics are decent enough that I would recommend this if you get it for < $5. I would not pay $15 for this game because it lacks long term replayability that you can find in games like Banished.Now for those of you who don't mind reading.....My mom and I each picked this game up when it was on sale and it was definitely a good buy for the price we paid.We love Banished and while I can say that this does not have the replayability of Banished (in my opinion I could see MAYBE playing it through two or three times, whereas Banished has much much more replayability), it did entertain me for an evening or two.The crafting system is simple, click what raw materials you want or let the auto production go crazy, I ended up doing a bit of both. For more refined products, you could only click to add more.You get to make 3 interconnected colonies on 3 different planets/moons. I liked how they were interconnected crafting-wise, however I wish the stories had also been connected in some way.I thought the story would be a bit lengthier than it was, but it was decent. Each colony had a different story lineI found Mar's story to be the most fleshed out, however the dialogue and VO is a bit... unnatural. Ceres' story was shorter and shallower but the dialogue flowed better than on Mars. The last planet had a SUPER short story and seemed to be the most ""important"" one scientifically but because of the VO it seemed more like a pat on the back instead of a true celebration of the achivement you supposedly make.There is a sandbox mode and a survival mode. The defense mechanics in the game aren't quite fleshed out enough to be compelling for a survival mode. The sandbox mode has possible replayability, however I never ended up playing the sandbox mode since it is exactly the same as story mode, except there are no objectives or story."

76561198060405844,Recommended,437870,28766002,"Posted: 28 December, 2016",all,Hawk Hunter,"With respect to single player:  This is an interesting game if you enjoy settlement management games.  The game has many buildings that each provide different base resources, as well as, more advanced fabricatable items.  To balance the colony well, the production of these different elements must be carefully monitored.  It is possible to set each to automatically produce given resources, however, this will quickly overwhelm your storage, so it is best to manually control the production.  The sandbox aspect of the game allows for new players to get practice with the different buildings in order to better understand their capabilities.  When playing in other modes it is possible to esstablish trade across planets.  For those familar with other settlement games, while this game does have multiple buildings, it does not have the depth found in games like civilization at this point, which allows multiple cities, or the depth of construction found with sim city.  The game does not appear to be being updated frequently, so it is unclear at this point if additional updates will continue in the future.  As a finished games, this is worth playing, if it continues to be developed, then it has a lot of potential.  That being said, the game is quite interesting and worth purchasing, especially when on sale.  All in all, I recommend adding this game to your collection if you enjoy settlement management games."

On the current one I just get a blank screen, a nifty looking and movable cursor, and some dandy title music for the main menu I presume. I have tried a few things such as forcibly exiting fullscreen, forcibly resizing the game and switching to updated proprietary drivers. Sadly none of these things fixed my issue.I realize I may be able to troubleshoot my way into a workable game but I can't be bothered right now. Maybe a little bit later."
