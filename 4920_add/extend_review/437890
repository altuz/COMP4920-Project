Galaxy-exploring process actually gives you benefits3. In some ways this games feels a lot like ""Space Rangers 2""4. Nice music5. Awesome dialoguesCons1. Clunky fighting-system (You can't skip turns during planet battles, which sometimes is very disturbing)2. No character customization (At all) P.S. but you can customize your ship by adding different modules3. Planet exploration is quite boring. Plantes only differ with tiles and atmosphere (You can breathe or you can't). There isn't much point in exploring them.I give this game 8/10Nice RL version of Space Rangers."
76561198041954665,Recommended,437890,22559109,"Posted: 21 April, 2016",all,Leroy,"I think the following 3 points describe what to expect from the game pretty well.1. The game is not even remotely rogue-like, it even has an auto-save function plus you can save/load at any time. Also there is not much replayability value.2. It features a lot of story telling with some exploration, it plays more like a gamebook. So expect simple graphics and A LOT of text, especially tons of background infos and secondary character dialogs which don't change much in the end.3. The game is playable although unfinished and hence rather short. I'm now 10hours into it and I think I've completed the main story and nearly all side quests. (The remaining one(s) require a lot of search which gets difficult towards the end of the game because of performance issues, a bug I guess.)All in all I think it's worth the 5 Euros and although it not even comes close (yet) to the size and depth of Space Rangers 2, it feels a bit like that, minus the annoying realtime ground combat."

But if you enjoy the roguelike genre for the depth of the game systems, simulations, and emergent gameplay - you're not going to find any of that here.The UI is a nightmare.  Look at the screenshots showing the 'Prev', 'Next', 'Fire!' and 'Cancel' buttons.  That's your combat depth, folks.I just noticed that they're also selling the original sound track.  My literal first thought when I launched the game was ""Wow, this music is terrible, make it stop""Save your dollar for the vending machine and buy a bag of Skittles."

Definitely it reminds Star Control title, though without tactical combats in real-time. And too much time passed for me to be able to compare these two better. So I'm not sure if this game makes sense for those who can play Star Control 2, at least in its current state.Also, currently Stardock is working on Star Control remake. What makes future of this game even less clear.Still, there is something here to surprise. For example, during my first planetary landing I lost one soldier and upon returning back to Earth, among congratulations for galactic wonders I brought back, I got also a letter from mother of that dead soldier. She hated me, my ship, whole project and all Earth governments for that. Or after I brought new energy technology back to Earth many people hated me because they lost their jobs."

I am so excited to see this game expanded upon and already it is very fun.This is the first space game I've played where I truly feel like a captain of a star ship.For example after a landing party mission I lost a marine to alien creatures. Upon return to earth I got a message from the crewmates mother cursing me for her sons death. I never before felt the burden of command like I did at that moment.10/10 and looking forward to each new update!"
,Not Recommended,437890,29840946,Posted: 10 February,all,䷃䷋䷃䷏䷀ ䷴䷼䷝,"I am quite fond of roguelikes, which is why this game instantly appealed to me, but if you're expecting a gaming experience which is ""rogue like"" then you may find this title a bit disappointing. As while the universe is procedurally generated each time you play, this game has an extremely verbose and elaborate plot which it demands that you follow. Even rougelikes such as ADOM, where the quests (and NPC's) are always the same, at least you could choose if you wanted to participate in them or not. So because it's not tagged ""interactive fiction"" I am going to be extra hard on it. Because if I wanted to read I would pick up a smegging book! And if it were tagged as interactive fiction I would have most likely avoided it, which I wish I had.But aside from my own personal problems. There's still plenty wrong with the game itself. For example, I will never get used to the backwards way the game displays new messagesat the top of the message display! Instead of at the bottom which has been the standard way of doing things since before computers were even really a thing! Maybe they do things differently in Russia, but I suspect that it's just an extremely poor decision by the programmer.Also, as this game involves doing as much research as you can as quickly as possible it's annoying that there is not some kind of notification sound to notify you when research has been completed. Which means that you will have to be constantly monitoring the bottom of the screen to avoid having all your scientists sitting around doing nothing because they have finished their research project weeks ago.Your ship can be leveled up and enhanced a little bit with experience. But not your actual crew, who always function at the same level no matter how long they've been with you. And you never get to know any of their names except for the section heads. I find it hard to feel for any of my crew members passing as I might if they had names, which for a game so dependent on story seems a bit poor.Even if you are really into a games plot more than the actual gameplay, the story still feels rather weak. For example, at the start of the game I had the opportunity to ask the head of engineering out on a date with me in the captains quarters. But then the plot seems to make no additional use of what could easily be a romantic sub-plot, and it seems a like poor writing that I can invite her to have dinner with me (which she nervously accepts), and then absolutely nothing afterwards. Although I have only played a little over half-way through the plot and there COULD still be some romantic development, I asked her out right at the start of the plot and have heard not mention of it so far.The graphics, which are not always a concern of mine are, well let's just say ""functional"" and leave it at that. The design certainly won't win any prizes for beauty or functionality. Especially when considering the messages being displayed backwards, I know I already mentioned it but it seems like such a big mistake I felt it worth mentioning twice. All the wondrous varieties of flora, fauna and geography tend to look very similar after visiting just a few planets.Also, one of your objectives is to seek out new planets for potential colonisation. And a little way into the plot you do find a suitable planet. But my problem is, the planet we found suitable for habitation was an icy planet with few resources and many hostile creatures. Which struck me as a bit odd, because our expedition has already encountered at least a couple of tropical paradise planets, with breathable atmosphere, pleantiful resources and little if any threat from the native wildlife. Surely it would have been better to establish a colony on one of those instead of a barren icy planetoid, which was also in another races territory I might add.If I had to sum this game up in four words, they would be ""too long; didn't read"". Yet I am having a bit of fun with this game, despite the long winded and often clichéd and artificial dialogue I intend to play it through to its conclusion. But I still can't recommend it to anyone except maybe fans of interactive fiction, and I do regret adding it to my library.6.9/12"

It have very interesting and well written storyline and side quests. The only things that disappointed me was surface explorations of planets - they all just randomized set of just, like, 5 type of tiles. But I hope that will be improved in future. In all - very interesting game, strongly resembling Star Control 2 and riddled with nice easter eggs."

Keep in mind, it's not for everybody. It really captures that "" old, sh*ty game"" vibe. Which I totally appreciate but can be rather daunting and drive you insane. Pretty casual. Lots of content. Lots of reading. I don't think it was originally written in English so the English is rather crappy, even game changingly so. I accidentally shot some dude which maybe was an unavoidable event but never the less it could not have been more confusing and vague. The interactions with aliens aren't very realistic social interactions and you can really tell that the developers... don't get out much. But really fun and totally worth the price. 8.5/10"
76561197979466873,Recommended,437890,22711645,"Posted: 29 April, 2016",all,Matamoscas,"I think this game is an unpolished jewel, and its development is promising.It's definetly worth its price.It's important to know that the game is especially based on the storyline, so there is a lot of text to read, but also allows you to do some other stuff, like exploring systems, planets, etc.."
76561197984269843,Recommended,437890,22350855,"Posted: 10 April, 2016",all,jinnantonix,"What a great game!  Easily worth the time and money!AuroraRL is your basic star exploration game.  You shuttle between planets and between solar systems.  At each planet you can scan and (if possible) land to collect resources, alien technology and artificats, and to kill creatures.  The controls are pretty straightforward and somewhat of a throwback to an earlier time (twenty five years or so ago), where you moved in blocks, as a group.There isn't a ton yet to this game.  But once you get past the introductory few exercises, there are some decent character and race interactions.  But the groundwork for a truly awesome and excellent game is here.There are a few annoying bugs -- the game has crashed twice and two really inopportune times.  It's all part of a game being developed.  But I haven't been this excited about a game in a long time.Time will tell what kind of support the devlopers give to their gaming community.  My hope is...a lot of timely stuff."
76561197985573260,Not Recommended,437890,28642812,"Posted: 25 December, 2016",all,Hade,"Had this game come out in late 1980's then it would have been a really poor version of Starflight with slightly better graphics and too much dialog..First time I played it, it was in English. I exited, went back into the game and it was in Russian. Tried several times and the game is permanently stuck in the Russian language. At which point I requested a refund. No point in playing a game that you can't understand or change the language. And there's lots of dialog to read and you have to hit the right dialog to get out of it.This game has no replay value. Everything is pre-determind. I found this to be the most boring aspect of the game, besides the dialog.Really not much to do in the game, fly to a planet, scan it, land, get resources, press fire to shoot at wildlfe, move on. Ofcourse the wildlife can see you all the time and has longer range, while for you to see it , you have to explore that area first (darkened out). Yeah, that makes sense, I've scanned the planet, but can't actually see anything. Also your people die easily, you have to carry more medkits then you actually have the resources to make.Research can be a pain, you have to be constantly assigning scientists to the same task over and over an over.There are bugs present that will just annoy the hell out of you. For instance, if you're on a planet with wildlife, every step you take will zoom you out (to the landing screen) and then back.Did I mention the music is from the 80s and so are the sound effects.Yes, I know it's EA, but you guys are selling it here, so you get rated on how it is, not how you think it will be."

,Recommended,437890,25676661,"Posted: 24 September, 2016",all,SpäceCädet,"I'd say AuroraRL is basicly the spiritual sucessor to the Starflight and Star Control games for MS DOS, which by itself is amazing since there hasn't been anything quite like those for decades. For fans of the MS DOS game this is a nice game and you'll most likely enjoy it, despite it's shortcomings here and there. Almost everything's in here, your ship building, and traveling and exploring space, researching sciences, contacting with alien races, scanning planets and landing where you want and adventuring with your landing party, however, unlike the original, you can't create your crew from scratch. You can contact with your ship's crew, although to be honest I can't stand Gordon and Sarah, I get that you are a smart and merited scientist Gordon, but don't tell me you want to run complex psychological tests on an alien you know nothing about, I know damn well that your Ph.D doesn't cover that! I'll let your morphine addiction pass but I won't tolerate clinical malpractice on my ship.As for Sarah, I just don't like that she lets my ship fall apart and lets everything break and I'm afraid of going to her quarters because I dislike the music she has playing there.Other than that I enjoyed the characters so far, and the music is excellent throughout the game even that one at Sarah's I guess, I just personally dislike it. The visual side is very good, although the textures on planets could be more varied. Something I really miss in this game is that there aren't energy shields (or at least I haven't found them yet) I think they would add a lot to the space battles because so far they are pretty straight forward. Lastly there's also the english translation that could use some proofreading. Personally I don't mind it, but I imagine some people may be put off by this. Overall i'm very happy with AuroraRL even considering that it's still in early access I had a lot of fun with it. I think that any person that enjoyed the Starflight  and Star Control games will enjoy this to some degree, and in case you haven't played the these games, perhaps you'll enjoy this as well because it uses a very unique formula that isn't used at all anywhere else (that I know of)."

It has so many secrets that so many of us yearn to uncover, to discover, to explore. This game captures that feeling so well.Your mission? Explore space and bring back scientific data to help save the human civilization on Earth. As you deal with all the dangers of space you'll be given a sense of what it might be like to captain a ship meant to save the human race.This game is fantastic. It has it's few bugs and other issues, but that is only to be expected of an early access game. In fact I was quite surprised at how good it actually is.I can absolutely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys space games, especially ones who focus on the exploration part."
