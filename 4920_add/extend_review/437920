,Recommended,437920,32166443,Posted: 3 June,all,RockstarCRO,"Is this Tetris? Do we say Toe-mato or Toh-mato? Have games with falling blocks been patented? Why don't we see the other side of the moon? The answer to all these questions is the word : perception.Tricky Towers is a Tetris based game in which allows players to challenge one another in three different game modes. In short, the game does deliver excitement, fun and challenge when playing with others, but does lack some depth in it's base version. If interested, I would recommend a purchase on sale, otherwise you might feel a little ripped off paying the full price.Tricky Towers pits one player against another in a competition of falling blocks. Like Tetris, players have the opportunity to obstruct other players. Unlike Tetris, the players have the opportunity to either boost their own tower, or attack another player. In doing so, opponents can decide to enhance their towers or attack themselves. Some attacks include making ice blocks that are slippery, enlarging a block to an abnormal size and slowing down game pieces. Some defense mechanisms include building an island to provide extra building area, using vines to reinforce pieces together and stones that make solid immovable pieces. This is a great addition to the game as it can change the entire situation with one move. In other words, it keeps it interesting. Unfortunately, the power-ups are limited in variety. They are welcomed, but the game does not offer enough variance in regards to attacks and defenses in my opinion.The three games modes included in the game are race, puzzle and survival. Race is my personal favorite in which players have to build up their tower to a certain height to win the game. As the player builds up their tower, there is another line that lowers closer and closer to the players tower to indicate when they will receive their next power up. In survival, the players are given three lives. Every time a player let's a block fall into the abyss, the player loses one of those lives. It is possible to recover a life within a certain time frame, but this is definitely a difficult game mode. The last game mode (puzzle) requires the players to fit as many blocks as they can below a certain line. Every time a player drops a block into the abyss, the finish line drops lower and lower, making it harder for players to fit in more blocks. The player with the most blocks underneath the line, wins!Thegame-playplays quite differently than traditional Tetris. The pieces are loose and are not quite fixated in place - until they are placed. If the player drops a piece too quickly, there is a chance the piece will wobble and the momentum may knock other pieces out of their place. Additionally, the player may knock pieces that are out of place by pressing the bumpers (R1-L1/RB-L). The feeling is a lot looser than Tetris. I like this variation as it adds a new dynamic to an old styled game. The fact that players can attack each other in this new sense (using power-ups) is also a neat feature. Being from the old Tetris age, it would have been nice for them to include a classic version in which every time you score a line, your opponent would gain that line. Additionally, there is no classic Tetris mode, only the three modes that were stated above. In my opinion, such a classic mode that has withstood the tests of time should have been included.Thevisualsare appropriate for the game atmosphere and setting. The level designs are good, but I feel there could have been more variance in the backgrounds, tiles/textures and block colors. Some versions of the game will allow players to *purchase* alternate block skins (yay.... not). Thesoundsare okay and could make more of an attempt immersing players into the atmosphere. The basic impact and power-up sounds are good, but don't make any spectacular noise. The music suits the game, but again, a little more umph could have been given here.Overall, a decent game and would say definitely wait for a sale. I even found the sale price to be a bit high. I'm happy with the purchase, but I wish got more in the form of game-types, skins or power-ups. Only seeing three game modes made be a bit choked.RATING : 7.0/10GameplayBStory / CampaignN/AVisuals / User InterfaceB-Sounds / MusicC+Replay-abilityC+OverallC+"

The physics feel pretty good and the different modes feel like they have enough variety for it to not get old too fast. Couch co-op is great but playing on the network is sometimes spotty. I like it.

Very polished too- you can tell the developers really put the extra effort into this. The physics feel right (except every once and a while when an L piece just refuses to stick onto the corner of another piece), and the graphics are fantastic.I hope these developers continue to make games and even consider adding game modes to Tricky Towers. I'd love a multiplayer cooperative mode where all players share a single tower.I don't typically buy DLC, but I am planning on purchasing the character pack to further support this developer!"

This becomes grinding *REALLY* fast.  There are only 4 avatars for 4 players?  I mean that's just lazy.  The characters only have a handful of reactions/emotes at best, I didn't count, but I think a ""handful"" would even be generous as a term.-  When playing locally, you can't even name your character, they all use your steam name.  What's up with that, seriously!-  A lot of the game is frustrating, and not in a good way:The placement ""rules"" for what sticks, and what does not, are entirely inconsistent.  IE: sometimes putting own a ""T"" shaped block, using the bottom section of the ""T"" to latch sideways to a cliff will hold, try it in another spot, on a similarly solid surface, and it just won't.  Why?  Who knows!The last bit just ruins the gameplay.  The game has a few things built in to up the ante (wind, swaying towers, offensive spells, etc.), but having the rules of placement changing arbitrarily without any rhyme or reason is just poor game design.Bottom line, what you see in the video's is basically the entire game, front to back.  There isn't much to the game, and while it's fun, you're effectively paying $15 for less content then you'd find in a typical flash game."

I don't play tetris a lot, and I'm pretty bad at it, but with this game I can just relax and have a good time on my couch. One of the only games these times that support couch co-op on PC, much appreciated. The online functionality works good, though a (quick-) chat functionality would be handy to communicate/taunt your competitors. PC options are a bit sparse in my opinion (as a PCMR veteran), audio sliders, rebindable keys would be appreciated. I would also like an option to change language to English, as it takes my system language (Dutch), which I don't prefer for gaming.My first impressions are that this game is a mix between Tetris and Jenga, which seems to have pretty deep tactical possibilities when placing the blocks, to prevent (or cause) falling of the tower. On top of that it oozes fun and is a well polished experience, with a soundtrack that reminds me of the Rayman Legends series. It makes me happy and gets me in the right mood for playing.Overall, especially for the introductionary price, I highly recommend this game if you want some lighthearted game that is great to play with friends, local or online."

You can use either controller, OR keyboard! (Though keyboard takes more practice and getting used to.) Choose from 3 different difficulties from easy, normal, or SPECIAL.

76561198265430797,Not Recommended,437920,28983525,Posted: 3 January,all,challenbellamey,"In my few hours playing Tricky Towers I have mostly played the 'endless puzzle' mode as it is the most similar to Tetris, which is why the game appealled to me. Here are the pros and cons:Pros- I really like the concept of Tetris with physics. Having to balance the blocks so that they don't fall is the most fun element of this game.- The game looks great and has a nice style.Cons- If you make a mistake, it is very difficult to come back from it as the presence of gravity means that all your future blocks will just slide off the misplaced block, unless you manage to create a wall and roof around the misplaced block.- The game creates floating blocks as the puzzle progresses, but these often spawn very close to the laser (which you fail if you surpass). This means that as your tetris blocks start moving faster as the puzzle progresses, sometimes they will hit the floating blocks and instantly fail the game for you. Maybe this is a feature but it seems like more of an annoying fault.- When you rotate a tetris block, it swings around instead of instantly rotating. If you do this anywhere near placed blocks, the block you are holding will instantly drop and will tend to result in a misplace.- The controls aren't amazing. Moving a block downwards, it seems to keep it's momentum after you stop and will usually crash into your tower. I figure they did this for stylistic effect but it ends up just being annoying. Also, trying to nudge a block into sideface crevice, sometimes you will time it right and sometimes you won't, it would be better if it was a little more forgiving on that front.- I'm not really into the spells and random huge blocks of the other game modes.These cons together mean that you can't make any clever manouvers, and if you make a mistake you will often have to restart. To me this is unlike how a Tetris based game should be, as the clever manouvers and coming back from mistakes are what make the game fun. Otherwise it is just mindless stacking blocks like this game seems to be. It's fun for a while but I find myself just wanting to play normal Tetris.Suggestions- It would be great if they could fix some of the cons I listed.- Also, having customisable game modes (the player can change options such as removing the floating blocks from puzzle mode etc.)"

It's the exact right balance of simplicity and difficulty. You understand exactly what the situation is the first time you put a Z block on its short edge and watch it topple over and take a chunk of your tower with it. The magic spells are balanced just pefectly to help or hinder in equal measure, and require strategy in their application. And that moment when you've placed your last piece on top of a precariously swaying tower crossing the finish line, and as the countdown timer ticks down you watch powerless as your tower leans into an inexorable collapse and your loss is now a forgone conclusion, you will laugh like an idiot as it crumbles into the sea, piano and all."

In standard tetris the aim of the game is to create lines and clear the board so you can continue gaining points. Tricky Towers plays so much differently in this regard as your main aim of the game is to make the moststablestack of blocks. That paradigm shift alone is enough to make this a compelling little game, but the developers have created different game modes that all play with this in a different way.The single player experience consists of challenging levels revolving around the different game modes and are generally very enjoyable, however the multiplayer (even though it uses the same game modes) is a different beast alltogether. The game modes are competitive in nature and rely on different magical powers to either help you or hurt the other players. These are novel and fun effects that either obscure visibility or mess with the stability of their tower.Anyways, that's all well and good, but there are some cons, the developers are continuing to patch the game afterall. ;)The game right now has fun game modes but it needs more. Whether they are competitive or cooperative new game modes can only add to the value of this game. The second con is that the online multiplayer is split into different difficulties and game modes, nice for the person who wants to customise their online experience, but that can only work with a large community. Right now iti is fractured and games take too long to find. a ""Quick Play"" button that randomizes the game modes and difficulties would be perfect and not fracture the community.Well that's about it. Not really a professional game reviewer but I like games and like to have fun. I think everyone should pick up this game so I can have more people to play against.Okay Edit time:I still think this game is great. With the new tournament update there are some notable improvements. Seaching for games online actually seems to work thorugh tournament mode, and the structujre of it makes it so I can play more games before hjaving to search for another player.

There are single-player trials but where it really shines is the local versus. There are 3 modes in versus, all with their own unique stratgies: Race (build a tall tower quickly), Survival (don't drop blocks), Puzzle (place blocks beneath a line).The game appears very simple at first, but there is quite a bit of strategy in placing the blocks in such a way that they interlace to provide as much support as possible. On certain difficulties, there is both white magic (power-ups that help your tower, like glue and morter) and dark magic (power-ups that harm your enemies tower, like weird blocks and ice). To cause the most damage possible, It is important to watch opponents' towers to cast spells at opportune times.There is a certain wonderful dramatic arc to building your towers, regretting earlier placement decisions, and watching your tower sway and crumble to the ground.

As a long time Tetris fan this game is a great twist on it, you build a tower using tetris blocks and try to keep it from tipping, while avoiding various hazards. Its a great time waster.

,Recommended,437920,24854007,"Posted: 12 August, 2016",all,ProdigyXP,"This is a really fun game that will especially resonate with fans of Tetris.While this game does have a single player component, I have mainly been playing the multiplayer. The single player basically consists of ""Trials"", which are various scenarios where you don't actually compete against anyone except yourself. There appears to be a lot of these scenarios for the completionists out there, but I do wish the the game offered AI opponents. It would be nice to have AI opponents of various increasing difficulties to compete against as you progress through a single player campaign. That said, I don't really play this game for the single player. I play it for the multiplayer, which, in my opinion, is where this game really shines (and is worth the price of admission all on its own).The multiplayer pits you against 2 to 3 other players (either local or online). There are 3 different game modes:-Race-Race is basically a race to the checkered finish line way up in the sky. Once your tower gets fairly tall, all those somewhat sketchy building decisions you made back on your foundation begin to show their face in the form of a swaying skyscraper of death, destruction, and despair. One more ill-placed shape could send most, if not all, of your Jenga-like masterpiece tumbling into the ocean below.-Survival-Survival is fairly similar to Race, but you must make sure that you don't lose any pieces into the ocean. You start each match with 3 hearts (think ""lives"") and a total of 66 random pieces that you will attempt to use. Should you successfully use all 66 pieces before your opponents use all of theirs, you will be the winner. Each time you lose part of your structure into the water below, you lose a heart (your hearts are located under your animated character that floats around your tower). If you lose all 3 hearts, you are out. Fortunately, one of the Light Magic spells is a replacement heart, so you might be able to recover from some mishaps if you are lucky enough to recieve one.-Puzzle-Puzzle is a mode where you must try to use as many pieces as possible, without touching (or going beyond) a yellow line that runs horizontally across your screen. Dropping pieces into the water will raise your platform by one unit, giving you less useable space each time. If a player piece comes to rest and is touching the yellow line, the piece is removed and you can no longer add any new pieces. You must wait for the other player(s) to finish and then the game will tally up how many pieces each player used successfully. The winner is the player who successfully used the most pieces.As if worrying about your own building decisions wasn't difficult enough, your opponents are constantly having a say in the matter as well! Each player will routinely have to choose between helping themselves build a stronger tower with ""Light Magic"" (special random items that periodically become available, based on current building progress, and can help stabilize your tower) or throwing a monkey-wrench into everyone else's design plans with ""Dark Magic"" (also special random items that are earned the same way, but impact everyone else in a potentially negative way). The catch is, you can only choose one or the other each time they are offered...Should you take advantage of a piece that could help steady your swaying tower, or take a shot at your opponents in hopes of literally knocking them off balance? This decision-making process is what really adds a fun twist to this genre.Things I would like to see added:oAn option to play public games in random mode. As of right now, only friends games will randomly cycle through all three game modes. This keeps the games fresh by mixing things up a bit. If you join a public game, you will stay on the same mode throughout the duration of your stay.oThe ability to chat with other players. I know this can be a 'be careful what you wish for' thing, due to some unpleasant players out there, it would be nice to make a comment periodically to someone for a job well done. At the very least, it could even be pre-defined comments such as ""gg"" or ""well played"", etc. This just adds a little bit more to the social aspect of the game.oThe ability to customize the game settings more. ""Best of 10"", for example. Also, having the game track wins & losses for everyone to see. This would help keep the competitive juices flowing and allow for some bragging rights amongst your friends (or in my case, just the opposite).oA pentalty for players who ""throw away"" pieces in the Race mode. As of right now, it appears that players can just discard any piece they don't like by just moving it to the side and dropping it in the water. I would like to see a random dark magic dropped on a player who loses X number of pieces into the water during Race mode.The game is a lot of fun and I am very happy with my purchase. The developers seem very receptive to customer suggestions, which is always a good thing. I look forward to additional updates that will improve the experience even further."

Not only does this game contain Wizards, it allows you to PLAY as one of those wizards.In gameplay not unlike Demon Souls/Dark Souls/Dark souls II/Bloodborne/Dark Souls III, this game allows for online play, but not just friendly, Wizardly duels. These online matches are for posturing, flexing your might at your opponents and pushing them around when they try to posture back. It isn't the greatest mind, or the fastest hand that wins, it's the biggest jerk.Tricky Towers has players stacking blocks of varying shapes to satisfy various outcomes:- get to the top first- don't fall over- and a third oneWhilst you are trying to get ahead of your competitors, sometimes you can gain the ability to cast a spell, each time you have a choice of two. You can choose the spell that effects you, mostly in a positive way, or you can choose the spell taht effects your opponents, mostly in a negative way. The fact is that in four-player your negative spell effects three people, and that's just too good value for money to not do. Sure, you could cast yourself the vine spell and then you have yourself a nice solid base there sir, or you could cast the OBSCURING MIST on THREE IDIOTS. Now which of those sounds instantly more satisfying? Thats right, it doesn't involve solid bases. More like the opposite.Tricky Towers is a very fun game which can be played online or couch co-op, which is fantastic. It can almost reach Mario Party levels of hate-fun when you have a few friends all together casting spells on each other constantly to mess everyone up.The only better thing is actually being a Wizard."

It's great in single mode as well with friends in multiplayer competition. Your friends will get super-quickly into it - everybody knows how to build towers out of Tetris blocks. But also thanks to the excellent design, the look&feel and the cute characters with their sounds. The single player campaign is challenging, but has tons of weird ideas to make use of the three game modes. Tricky Tower is also one of the few games that I buy decoration-only DLCs - which I wouldn't do with any other game so far.The only thing that sucks is the physics - but I guess the name of the game already warned you.

I had no connection issues at all.For single player there are a bunch of quests to that work as tutorial/training or later ones as real challenges.Update after some additional hours:There are some issues:- the player base is too small for any matchmaking. As a noob you might play against someone who places their pieces faster then you might imagine.- The game sometimes changes it's decision who has won after a close finish. One is crowned and another one gets the points.- Players with laggy internet can get problems like stones colliding with nothing etc.- Either lots of players quit during a match (that does only last some minutes) or they get kicked from the game by connection problems.I still recommend the game.

The game itself plays great and is certainly fun with a group of friends, but there's only 3 modes. Some people have suggested adding a classic tetris style mode, and I don't think that's the right fit for this game, nor do I really have suggestions for what other modes to add to increase the value, unfortunately.Also, there is no way to remap keyboard controls and they are pretty unintuitive. Great mapping on a controller, as this game was probably made with its PS4 release in mind.The game's certainly worth buying, but maybe not at full price. I'm a little conflicted on whether to give it a thumbs up or a thumbs down, but hopefully my disclaimer and text make my position clear enough, and as I said, the game modes that exist certainly are enjoyable."

,Recommended,437920,24698925,"Posted: 3 August, 2016",all,KillSlim,"An extremely enjoyable legally distinct block placing game, which uses steamworks, and has a fun physics element. In Tricky Towers you use different shaped blocks to build towers under certain restrictions, depending on what game mode. There are 3 game modes available (+1 special modifier for each) and supports up to 4 player multiplayer. There are also a large number of singleplayer stages to complete.In Race mode, you must build a tower faster than your opponents to reach a certain height.In survival, you must use all of the blocks given to you, however you can only have up to 3 collapses.In Puzzle, you are given a piece of terrain in which you must carefully place your blocks to build a tower with a given height restriction (But the terrain you start on is extremely narrow, so the challenge comes from using the blocks to expand horizontally).The physics element adds a lot, which means rickety, shoddily-based towers will likely collapse, which may be fatal depending on the game mode. There are also magic spells, named light and dark magic, which you can use to buff your own tower, or sabotage your enemies. A light magic spell example would be a binding spell, which binds the next block you place with those surrounding it, making it stronger and more stable. A dark magic example would be fog, which clouds the enemy towers and makes it difficult to see where to place blocks. The magic spells all drastically affect the outcome of the game, and you can even use light magic to turn an enemy's dark spell that has been used on you to your advantage.Puzzle went from my least to my most favourite mode, as block placement needs to be careful and precise, and you need to plan ahead with how the tower you create will take shape. I would say the hardest mode would be survival with it's special modifier, as in this mode you must survive with waves of dark magic thrown at all players.I'd like to see more functionality, like a chat or even a simple VGS system. However this doesn't affect the game much. In the future I'd perhaps like to see some kind of coop game mode.It's relatively inexpensive and I strongly recommend this game."

I even bought the extra character pack DLC, the visuals are super cute and inviting, it just looked plain fun! A no-brainer for a longtime Tetris fan since the NES days, or so I thought.I tried and I tried to get over the complete random and wonky physics and luck based gameplay like some other reviewers here have described already, but I just can't! It's a trial and error game, skill and placement of the blocks doesn't mean a thing, especially given the fact that they don't lock together like in Tetris, so they're bound to collapse no matter what, sooner or later, so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that randomly pops-up or gets thrown at you at any point can completely crumble a whole tower you luckily managed to pull together, forcing you to retry again and again. Maybe it's because of the Unity engine or a bad implementation of the physics, or by design. It's frustrating regardless, to the point of sucking out all the fun you might expect from a quirky Tetris based title. Add to this a complete lack of gameplay options and a barebones single player experience, only a trials and endless mode are available. That's it!I'd go with Tetris Ultimate over this any day, both for single player and multiplayer. Even with Uplay it's still much more fun, and a better experience than this lackluster, exasperating and certainly overpriced game. Tetris Ultimate goes for $10 while offering more and no frustrating, random gameplay. Even Anode, also a Tetris-esque title here on Steam, offers a similar experience to the classics of the genre, delivering engrossing mechanics, modes and a fun factor that's lacking here. Don't be fooled by the eye candy!"
76561198061730930,Not Recommended,437920,33160707,Posted: 2 July,all,alo_obert,"Game slightly based on Tetris.Why should I recommend this game:Classic Tetris mechanics are completely turned upside down due to use of ""magic"" and ""real"" physics. If you are an old-school Tetris fan, be aware that you will find a completely different kind of competition in Tricky Towers and this is a game though to be played for fun with friends or random people. And the truth is that the game succeds at this goal and I enjoy playing from time to time.Why I would not reccomend this game:As I said above, the main objective of this game is to enjoy playing with friends locally or by internet, but... alas, not both modes at the same time. This, that may seem a little bit stretched as a a recomendation-killer at first sight, is letting me down a lot of times: People I know who has this game and like to play it are in relationships and they, obviously, enjoy playing this game with their significant other as much as they can. Yeah... Not being able to play with them at the same time is a pity.I have not developed this game, so I don't know the code complexities involved, but... At first sight It doesn't seem like rocket science to implement the mixed multiplayer functionality. Instead, the only programming involved in the game seems to be the release of skin packs DLC every now and then.The impression I have is that once the game has been released and seems to work relatively fine, the only motivation (oh, surprise!) of the developers is to keep milking the cow as much as they can. In this suspicious frame of mind, I even find it possible that they want to keep multiplayer modes separate on purpose. This way they can try to sell more than one copy of the game to people living together and willing to play with remote friends.Anyway, I don't know a thing about the bussiness model that developers intend to follow and, of course, they are free to do what they want with their product. I will just keep hoping that in some months or years the functionality will be implemented (who knows... maybe in a future Tricky Towers 2)Summary:This negative review is my way of showing the disappoinment of not being able to enjoy a game I find very appealing and funny due to a technical software limitation."

The goal is to make a tower of a certain height according to various conditions sometimes with random blocks or timed races.Its extremely fun and satisfying to play.  While the multiplayer games can be unpopulated as of July 2017 there are times when it is active with four participants.  Battling for the multiplayer cup is a delight.  Tricky Towers has a good sense of humour.  The weekly leaderboards are still active.  This modern take on tetris is gaming magic.  The surprise variations are challenging to overcome.

When we do get together, we rarely play videogames.So, 15 bucks a piece, requiring at least 2 copies to play with 1 friend, is quite expensive. Getting 2 copies at 15 bucks, is better, especially if we'd then get to benefit from a discount. But considering we're getting 1 copy, I'd say 5 bucks tops for a mini-game like this."

I finished my tower half a second before my friend.He got the win animation while I won. After that I got the points anyway. He was not happy because he didn't spot me crossing the finish line first.

It's a really fun time with friends in front of a tv with a few controllers/mates. Which is a real treat at a time when good local multi is a rare thing. (I have played a fair bit of this on ps4)However! The usual staples of a modern era competitibe puzzle-action game, such as fully featured singleplayer and a multiplayer, are basically missing. The singleplayer portion has a very difficult ""endless mode"" you might get some replay out of, and a series of straightforward and frankly boring challenges to complete. Not worth the asking price for solo play at least, but no great loss considered the core gameplay.My major gripe with the game is the online multi being quite poorly implemented, there is no cross-platform support between the ps4 and steam and the limited online playerbase is further segmented into 4 game modes and 4 difficulty levels (presumably the easiest way to find a match is to choose a random mode + a random difficulty level, altho this is unclear) What is really needed here is a modern quickmatch feature that is ideally cross-platform where players are matched according to skill, what is basically standard in modern online games in 2016. Leave all the mode and difficulty choices to games with friends.Given the lacklustre singleplayer  mode the game desperately needs a solid online component to make solo play feasable, and to justify the asking price of $15 USD. As it stands Tricky Towers is basically a classic Nintendo 64 era local multi game one might rent from Blockbusters semi-frequently. If you've got a couch set up and people to play with then grab it! Otherwise give it a miss or pick up on sale until the whole experience is a bit more rounded out."

There is an endless mode, where you play until you drop 3 blocks off the side, or you can play the puzzle mode, which has various stipulations on how your tower must be built, which is fine but doesn't hold it's appeal long. The real reason to play is multiplayer, but you better have someone to play with in person, because there doesn't seem to be anyone online, so I can't say how well that works. Multiplayer issues and it being a day old aside, this gamme just doesn't feel worth $15, maybe 10, at best. This game just wore out it's welcome in literally 20 minutes, and when I came back a while later it was exactly the same, except then I didn't really feel like coming back."

When I got the wii u that means I need to go into Wii menu and then its displayed at 480p, can hardly see it.So I came to steam and found the actual ""tetris"" game to have poor reviews, this game looked cool, 10 bucks, lets try it.We are having a blast so far.  The different modes keep it interesting. We can play for 30 minutes or more at a time.  I kinda wish there was a normal tetris mode where you clear lines and send them to your opponent, but I understand them wanting to do something different.  Also I wish you could take 2 player local multiplayer and play with both players online.  If it had these 2 things it'd be a perfect 10/10 for me.  Giving it a 9 hoping the devs continue support!

I feel after playing a few matches that it was left wanting a little bit, but playing with friends doesn't get boring too quick. The physics are good and workable, but there are only 3 vs modes and a very limited arsenal of white or black magic (things to help you or mess up your opponent). Overall, this game is good.

While adventure games and party games are fun to play, Tricky Towers is definitely a breath of fresh air. It is very similar to Tetris, but it gives a unique spin on the game.Pros:+ You can play with controllers (I use XBOX controllers, myself). You read that right. More than one controller on a PC.+ You also have the option of using the keyboard.+ Vibrant colors throughout the game+ Options to choose which character and block style you'd like. I believe there is DLC for some too, but I haven't dabbled.+ Chipper soundtrack and adorable character voices.+ Appropriate for young ages.+ Replayability is high for online multiplayer, local multiplayer, and single player play.Cons:- It would've been nice to have classic tetris gameplay too, but I don't know if that would be infringing on anything.I'm just super stoked I can play this game with family/friends a few hours away while playing with my husband on the same computer. Totally awesome. We need more games (good games) with this ability."
