76561198044873014,Not Recommended,438010,20821370,"Posted: 28 January, 2016",all,VietyV,"Nifty concept, needs a lot more work to be a good game.https://youtu.be/k01vReSO8DIThe basic gist of this game is a platformer where you can absorb certain type of attacks and then immediately use this to blast through walls, fly to spots you can't reach normally, etc(this is your sole method of attack) and you unlock your other ability as you go (there's two unlocks but one of them is really not that important). You finish the level by attacking 3 different boxes to open the way to the exit portal-thing. The fist two boxes you attack will unlock double jump and a longer attack (the same attack but you travel further).The attack/dash mechanic is pretty cool but the pacing of the game is pretty bad. This comes largely in part to level design, there simply isn't much to do within a level despite how large it is. The way most platformers deal with this is by constantly throwing enemies and obstacles at you. In this game you pretty much spend most of the time jumping into position, using your absorb ability to float and then fly where you need to once you get hit with an attack. The rather large tileset (tiles are the size of your character for the most part) added in with the fact that your attack is locked to 45 degree angles means that a lot of times you're just banging into corners because of slightly off positioning and that's the only real difficulty to the platforming.That is paired with rather slow movement most of the time and the fact that the levels open up into areas that end with you having encountered nothing. Literally just a waste of time to explore some places.The respawn system is strange. There are two blue heart pieces that you can collect which will let you respawn at checkpoints infinitely. Before you get both of those you will restart the level upon death. This creates a really weird contrast of hardcore one-shot platforming and ehh die as much as you want nobody cares (providing the respawn system doesn't bug out and restart the level anyway). This adds to how slow the game becomes because the game makes you go through the dull bits over and over whenever you die and by the time you can reach both respawn pieces you've more likely than not completed most of the level already anyway. This also makes half the checkpoints you can activate worthless since you wouldn't have the ability to respawn yet anyway. Maybe letting you smoothly (and quickly) restart on death like in meat boy would make it seem better, as it stands you have to sit through the whole death and restart sequence every time which gets aggravating really quickly. Maybe just give players the unlimited respawn  as an easy mode and the restart on death the normal mode. Hell, even the traditional lives system would be better.Aesthetically the game has an interesting look to parts of it and some tiles look pretty well drawn. The problem is how slapdash the levels tend to look, it looks as if the level was designed and then bits of random tiles were thrown in everywhere to attempt to make the level look more varied post-design. Another issue with the tiles is that they don't connect well which is a big issue if you're going to make levels by connecting tiles together. Especially when the SAME kind of tile doesn't connect to itself well.Every once in a while you come across a random piece of art in a frame on a wall which I can only assume is something the dev drew as a hobby. I mean that's nice and all  but...why is it in the game? There's no context or anything it literally just looks like they decided to throw in some art they made to show off for the hell of it.Overall: Cool concept to unlock your abilities as you go but it needs much more variety, better pacing, etc. Not Recommended."

My only complaints with the game so far is the movement can feel slow at times and you dont have much control over your jumps, for example in a Megaman game you can control the height of your jumps and such, here if you even lightly tap Z, your character goes flying all the way up into some traps. Overall I would highly reccomned this game as its a nice cheap, colorful, and fun game! Also the music is very catchy :P . I just hope a patch is implemented soon to make running and jumping smoother soon! (Especially since you get a rank based on your time in the game.)"

Personally I don't like that mechanic and I believe they could do a better job than having you stand still and get hit by enemy bullets which can get frustrating if you keep missing and you don't shoot in the right direction. And the game is really focused on this mechanic which annoys me that I can't justify playing through this.Conclusion: Barbones platforming game with a bad mechanic that is heavily dependant on it. Don't bother unless you want some trading cards.Rating: 3/10

Just look at the screenshots... I must have been gifted this game or it was in a bundle because I never would have thought about purchasing something that looks like a half-digested sonic on acid.Add in stiff controls, lame level design and odd music and you have yourself a loser. :(Sorry developers."
,Recommended,438010,22185474,"Posted: 1 April, 2016",all,Mahat,"This is not a bad game. But it's not great either.The main concept is actually very clever. It's something that no other game has come up with. It's used for attack, movement and defense. And this variety allows for a great number of different puzzles and combat styles. In other words, this game has a huge potential. - Presentation - 3.5/5The music is soothing. It's not the best ost ever, but it's relaxing and gives a good atmosphere to the game. It could be worked on to be even better, however. - Music - 2.5/5The art has its ups and downs. The particles and the main character sprites are amazing. The art is good and the animations are well-done. The enemies are good, but too simplistic. The background, however, is not that polished in comparison to these other elements. Perhaps some extra work on the backgrounds would make it look way better. - Art - 2/5The core mechanics are great. In each level you have to get the Double Jump power-up, the Extend Pulse and the unlocking the door to the next level. You have two heart pieces that, after you get both, you respawn on the nearest checkpoint whenever you die. Also, there's the pulse mechanic that, as mentioned before, is great for puzzles and combat. However, the enemies have very simple mechanics. Just one of them has a shot that is aimed at you. This makes it too predictable. It's a game that is very easy to speedrun, because it's always the same. Perhaps more variety in the enemies would make it better. - Mechanics - 2.5/5There is no story. And that's okay. You play because it's fun, challenging and relaxing. But there could be a story. Also, the game has only 4 levels. It's way too short. I completed it in less than an hour. I only kept playing it in order to get all the Steam Cards. - Story - 1/5I bought this game because I got a discount cupon on the last badge I made. I had never even heard of it before. However, it's very cheap and it's worth the price. Considering that it gives you 3 cards that can then be sold, it gets even cheaper than the original price. (in my case, I profited with it, since I had the discount)It's a game I would love to see a longer and more polished version of. And a game I will recommend to indie dev friends as an example of a project that could have gone further.Overall score - 2/5"

,Not Recommended,438010,22855824,"Posted: 7 May, 2016",all,TigerTrix,"Something different.  It was good at first, and easy to get the hang of.  But it gets a little difficult with timing.  By level 3 there was a tight spot that you have to jump and hold for absorption mode, meanwhile some projectiles can't be absorbed that cross the same tight spot and I kept dying.  It got too repeatative replaying the same stage up to that point to try to get past that.  Otherwise it has a checkpoint mechanic, but it only gets enabled if you get both respawn artifacts.  But I got sick of replaying the beginning of level 3. (2/5 stars)Otherwise it ran well on Windows 10 on my Alienware Alpha, full screen 1080 on my 47"" TV, played with an xbox360 gamepad."
,Not Recommended,438010,34053473,Posted: 5 August,all,Verdantil,"Tags: PlatformerAdditional Tags: Delete Local Content & Remove from LibraryTLDR: Uneven quality. Uninspired level design. static foes that are the same threat level as just trap blocks,  that shoot fire sprinked here and there. Xbox360 pad worked fine.Review: Game starts out okay as you learn to unlock the diffierent powerups by applying pulses to reward blocks. You learn to absorb fire, and use the dodge/sprint button. I thought the sprite for the protag and the animations for the special powers were really eyecatching. Every singe tile in the tilset is absolutely horrible to look at, so are foe's sprites, with the exception of the block that shoots fire which looked kinda cheap but acceptable. Audio was limited but not grating in terms of effects and the background music felt appropriately electronic and laidback to fit. Level design is just centered around funelling you towards the reward blocks that unlock new moves, which then opens up more paths, until you finally unlock the exit and leave. Your special abilities have to be abused constantly even though the threat by the environment is always nearly non-existant. Powers are mostly used for navigation and in that sense pulsecharge is way more useful than the dodge thing which turns itself off too fast and does not nearly allow itself to be used as a run/sprint button. The game started introducing branching pathways by level 2 and if thats going to be the case I demand a minimap as is customary in metroidvania style games.Conclusion: Really mixed impressions and ultimately just a hollow feeling as I navigate the ill conceived mazes and spam abilities and grow gradually more bored and disappointed"
