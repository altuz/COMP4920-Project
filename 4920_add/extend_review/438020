You are too dumb.Robots can see far.  You cannot see far.I got this game for mere pennies as part of a bundle.  In this game, you have 3 large levels with two variants...night and day.  Your goal is simple...open 3 supply crates (green boxes) and bring the contents back to your base.  Sounds fair, yes?  Imagine only starting out with ONE energy cell for a laser cannon, a hologram, or to go invisible for a few seconds...also imagine having a stone that's completely worthless.  Cars cannot run over robots AND Robots are spawncamping your bases like you'd expect from a typical TF2 server.  What a ripoff!If you want a game more difficult than it should be, have at it.  Otherwise, AVOID!!!0.5/10  *sigh*  Another game for the trash bin."
,Not Recommended,438020,24156621,"Posted: 7 July, 2016",all,KidwithSmurf,"I got this in a Steam Sale Bundle and at first thought, despite the reviews, the game description sounded like my type of game. Like a tactical stealth strategy action game where you kill aliens, who doesn't like the sound of that? However, I can't recommend this game to anyone as I'll list below in the Pros and Cons:Pros:♦ The game downloadsCons:♦ The game loads to a black screen no matter what options you choose (This is terrible as the game doesn't even work, it is just a black screen and when you move your mouse you can hear menu options and sounds but you can't play or see what you are clicking)♦ Very Buggy (Just check the reviews and discussion page for numerous bug reports)♦ The developers don't seem to care about the game (People have reported numerous bugs and no dev has repsonded or attempted to supply a fix for any of them)♦ Can't get achievements or 100% this game as game is broken (This is annoying for anyone who wants to 100% every game)♦ Developers are releasing new games instead of fixing this one (This game was released in January and is broken, yet the developers released a new game in March... seems as though they are sweeping this one into the bin, leaving all those that paid for it with no game)Overal, do not buy this game as 9/10 people including myself can't even get to the main menu. This is because despite what options you choose, the game loads to the main menu screen with sound, except all you can see is a black screen. I have tried re-installing, verifying cache, numerous Windows Compatibility mode settings and nothing has worked, nor has there been a solution given by the developers. Therefore, this game is unplayable and I can strongly recommend no-one buys it.PS: If anyone is wondering, I have more than the required hardware to run this game. I have Windows 10 (Fully Updated) with my other PC hardware found here:http://prntscr.com/bpxkku"

Basically after 5 minutes of playing nuclear wind comes and you die. The 80s Terminator-esque aesthetic and sound design is done really well. The underlying gameplay should be fun but it is painfully slow. I would have had more fun if the enemies were a little bit scarcer and everything moved a bit faster. Waiting for an enemy to turn around or leave an area is super frustrating.

,Not Recommended,438020,31404691,Posted: 27 April,all,Garry,"Not recommended, overall a frustrating game. Robots seem to always be camping all of the bunkers, so getting started is probably the hardest part. The invisibility doesn't seem to work that great or sometimes even at all, and outrunning the robots is not going to happen."

,Recommended,438020,22348903,"Posted: 10 April, 2016",all,Reptar Le Scrub,"It is extremely difficult, I got two supply chests and then I was super giddy and then the last supply crate took all of my lives to get back to the bunker and as I waited for it to open I got stabbed by a robot. I like the game but I want the difficulty to not be so hard and maybe tone it down with how many robots are out at a time, because if you screw up once all the robots will flock to where you were and that sucks when you died right besides the supplies."

76561198051958085,Recommended,438020,22681772,"Posted: 27 April, 2016",all,Everyone,"While AI: Rampage is well-polished for the price, some of its important features are unfortunately botched. Still, it does enough things right that it remains enjoyable and true to what is advertised.Highlights:+AI:As one would hope after reading the game's title*, enemy behavior is on point. Robots chase you aggressively. Their hearing is acute and they have long sight lines, which are reliably blocked by objects. Pathfinding seems excellent. Passive movement is randomized but slow. All-around solid AI, no complaints from me here.+STEALTH MECHANICS:The player v.s. robot speed balance is good, as is the noise level for footsteps and gunshots. Combined with the aforementioned AI, this makes for enjoyable and tactical gameplay overall.+GRAPHICS:Detailed textures and lighting give the ""2-D"" levels a surprisingly realistic look. Performance seems very smooth and stable as well (although this isn't saying much, since my PC is high-end).+SOUND:The directional sound takes some getting used too, but it really adds to the realism. Wind, aircraft, and stomping robots all sound great and contribute to a nice soundscape/atmosphere**. The game sounds very good in my stereo headphones.+   Very high difficulty, generally for good reason (more on this later...)+   Player weapon/abilities give the player cool options besides pure hiding/running.+   The concept of spawning from bunkers and bringing supplies to them works well.+   Movement feels smooth, controls are generally responsive. (more on this later...)+   The ""human survivor of a robot apocalypse"" theme works in the game's favor.+   Short loading times: little delay between starting the game and playing.+   It's only two dollars!Roasts:-CONTROLS:Strangely, the WASD controls are linked to the direction you aim. So, depending on which way your character is pointed (determined by the mouse), pressing ""w"" could make you move down the screen while ""a"" would make you move right. This is disorienting for a top-down view game and contributes too much to the learning curve.-CONTENT:There are currently*** three levels, each with a day/night version. They are big, and will surely take a long time to complete (I have yet to beat one, despite playing mostly on easy), but the lack of variety may make that achievement less satisfying.-LEVEL DESIGN:First, each level's ""border"" actually only applies to the player and their visibility. There are robots beyond that border who may enter at random positions and times. This is clearly cheap for the walking robots. Also, the levels themselves have vast open areas and very few hiding spots. Altogether, this makes the current levels unfairly hard on high difficulty, preventing the AI from shining.-   It's sometimes hard to tell which objects block line of sight.-   The laser gun robot looks too similar to the melee robot.-   Wait time for entering the bunker is stupidly long.-   Nuclear wind can cause cheap deaths.-   The robots don't look as good as the environment.(Nitpick)-   The splash screens are very ugly.And after all those cons, my review is still a ""Recommended"". For two dollars, you get stealth gameplay with tactical depth, along with some serious production values. Just don't expect it to be easy to get into, and prepare to retry the same levels a bunch.Notes:*I have no idea why this is subtitled ""Rampage"". It's kinda misleading, if you think about it.**A previous reviewer claimed that the game's sounds infringe on copyrighted materials. I have no way of verifying this, so for review purposes I have assumed that the sounds are used legally.***The main menu implies that there are more levels being worked on by the developer. However, I can't find any evidence of updates since the game's release, so I'm skeptical of this."

,Not Recommended,438020,32346321,Posted: 11 June,all,HalfOfAKebab,"Pros:- I guess it's really easy to get the handful of achievements (to get a ""perfect game"" on your profile), but only if you want to drag yourself through all the levels- Steam Cloud supportCons:- Terrible engine- No story or plot- Robots OHK you- No tutorial or guide anywhere- Only 7 levels (with two extra ones greyed out and marked as ""work in progress"")- VSync only works on 60 Hz? Lol- Languages available: English, IIIIIII, and IIIIIIIIII- Awful controls- Conflicting keybinds that you can't change; dying because you tried to shoot a robot while near a crate- Your character turns much slower than you can move your cursor, meaning you have to wait so long to finish turning 180 to kill a robot chasing you- Robots hang outside your bunker and spawnkill you- Bad graphics- UI looks like it was made in MS Paint- Ridiculously hard even on the lowest difficulty; I can't even complete the first level- Four single-use items: stone (don't even know what this does, I couldn't figure out how to use it), invisible (sometimes works, sometimes doesn't), hologram (again, only sometimes works), laser gun (kills one of the dozens of robots in your path, and then you're screwed because they all heard the gunshot)"

With mortal cyborgs it could have been fun.For me i came to collect some achievements which are working properly, so i am satisfied."

I would not recommend it per se to anyone as a purchase but my money spent was covered.  The game runs on complete luck as best as I can tell and you carry an arsenal of weapons that are useless.  The overhead map is detailed and does work to set the mood of the game.  The reliance on luck as a method of difficulty destroys the game.  I waited on my second playthrough 5 minutes before being able to leave a bunker, only to have a helo fly by and spot me.  Good atempt, but needs major work to become fun and playable."
,Not Recommended,438020,29937004,Posted: 14 February,all,CthulhuTacos,"Probably one of the worst steam games I've ever played. Horrible controls that made me want to die, the lack of a tutorial made it difficult to figure out, and terrible stealth mechanics. The UI and title screen wouldn't be so bad if this was made in 2003, but the fact that the game has to close and reopen everytime you select a different level just feels ridiculous.Given the price you can argue that it's not so bad of an attempt, but it really feels unfinished and poorly put together. The graphics (aside from the player's model looking odd) are actually kind of nice in an old DOS kind of way, but the sluggish control ruins it."
