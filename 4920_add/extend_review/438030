The gameplay is fine, I guess, but there's not really anything to keep me playing it.  There's no replay value, the computer players don't seem to show up when I try to do singleplayer vs computer.  It's just me against a bunch of enemies and there doesn't seem to be a way to win.  The main thing that annoyed me about this game is that upon installing it and attempting to play, you will receive an error saying that steam cannot find the executable file for this game.  somebody was nice enough to post a solution on the forums:http://steamcommunity.com/app/438030/discussions/0/405691147594349721/So you have to rename the .exe based on whether you are playing it on mac or pc.  The fact that the game didn't even work on first startup was the main issue for me.  Having to jump through hoops just to get a game to work is not my idea of a pleasant experience.  If this issue gets fixed in the future, then I guess you can ignore this technical issue, but at the time of reviewing, it is unacceptable."

Hell, even the character designs are pretty much identical. The other game resolves a lot of complaints that reviews have. Bigger and unlockable weapon selection, better weapon sounds, faster animations, everything is there that this game is missing. If you want fast-paced, that's fast-paced. Much more than this, anyway. I guess the music in this game is somewhat better, but that's purely preference. Unfortunately, Super Crate Box doesn't have a local multiplayer.

The rest was idling for cards.)So...how do we pronounce this one?  ""Dead6hot""....*looks at the description* The developer says it's ""Dead Shot"".......*sighs are rubs his eyes* I see....this is gonna one of THOSE games.... =_=;;;Here we have another clone game ofSuper Crate Box(as other reviewers have surely noticed.  Sure it looks like ""Oh, but it's gotta be unique in SOME regard"", yes?  And you'd be right to assume that based on the trailer.  However, the only thing this game has to offer is local coop and local deathmatch, where both players use the same keyboard.  It's likely that you and your colleague will both just nod in agreement to play a better game instead.  Enemies have more health than you'd expect and only come in 2 kinds.  Slime and Tentacle Eyeball.Dead6hotdoes not count collectables likeSuper Crate Box(or its cloneMuffin Knight), but instead counts kills.  Much likeSuper Crate Box, collectables (which include health pickups and guns) only increase health and give you a random gun with an ammunition limit.This game also has only 1 song (which sounds like something out ofBombermanand has super awkward controls (O for grenade as Player 1, L as shoot as Player 1, Arrows as movement for Player 1).Is this game worth $1?  No way.  You're better off just trying outSuper Crate Boxfor free instead.  The only redeeming factor is that the developer knew how to copy an already existing game...however, the developer fails to make it something unique.  You might be able to predict that this was a student project, which is the only reason I can think of for this being the end result.  Good thing I only lost a few cents on this one (got it through a bundle).If 6 stands for S, then 0.5 is going to stand for F.F / 10   (0.5 / 10)  Another game that belongs in the garbage bin."

,Not Recommended,438030,21055631,"Posted: 8 February, 2016",all,Wally71551,"THE GAME IS MISSING THE EXECUTABLE AND REQUIRES YOU TO RENAME IT!!! For most people, rename Deadshot022916.exe to Deadshot122115.exe. For Mac users, rename to Deadshot020516. The developer has not done anything to try and fix this so the rest of the review can be disregarded unless you get the game to actually play.I recently purchased this game at the time of writing (8th February 2016) in the Lunar New Year Sale. I have not played very much (evident by my playtime) but have a basic grasp on the gameplay and how the game works, enough to write a review of decent length.I bought this game on an impulse buy seeing how cheap it was. I only briefly glanced at the reviews, they were mostly short and there wasn't much to go on. I aim to correct that. Dead6hot is a retro-styled 2D platformer mixed with fighter and shooter elements. I do enjoy platformers, fighters and games with a retro art direction, but this will not add bias to my review.Gameplay:The gameplay is fairly simple. There are two modes, Singleplayer and Multiplayer. At the time of writing, I have not tried Multiplayer, as there is no online mode and I have no one to play with at this moment. Multiplayer is local multiplayer, not requiring an internet connection on your device to play. Multiplayer and Singleplayer both include the Versus mode, which is a generic fight between two characters. There are 5 stages to pick from, all with varying layouts. On top of this, there are 10 different characters, ranging from a clown to a minotaur. In Versus Mode, it is a 1v1 match, where both characters have 3 lives.The character you use can run left and right, and also can jump, but doesn't have a mid-air double jump. Your character starts off with a pistol and a special (as far as I can tell this changes depending on which character you use). However every weapon in this game does have an ammunition limit. It is impossible to leave the stage, as going off the sides will bring you out it's opposite (the left side with bring you out on the right side, and the bottom will make you fall from the top, and vice versa). Item crates appear occasionally on stages, allowing you to get a new weapon to swap your current one with or to refill the ammo of the weapon in use. The controls for Player 1 use the arrow keys to control your movement, the L key to fire your weapon and the O key to use your special. As far as I am aware, these cannot be changed. Each character can only use 3 specials at one time. Health packs also spawn on the stages, allowing you to completely refill the health bar, which is located in the top corners of the screen. CPU ability levels can also be changed, from Timid, then onto Split, then Aggro.The other mode that is found is simply called Singleplayer or Co-Op. The name changes depending whether you are playing in Singleplayer or Multiplayer. You pick a stage and character as normal, but when the game begins, it is more of a platforming side. You are fighting multiple enemies. One is a small slime, which spanws the most frequently, while the other is a floating eye, which is taller. The CPU enemies do not have weapons for themselves, and can only hurt your character by touching them. If your character falls on top of an enemy, you will still take damage. You are tasked with surviving as long as possible and killing as many enemies as possible too. There is no timer for any of the modes in Dead6hotPros:- A good selection of different character designs.- Great art direction and style for the game.- Enjoyable and not frustrating for the user to play.- Set at a good price.Cons/Improvements To Be Made:- Characters are no different in abilities and movement. It would be good to differenciate between each character and not make the different choices purely astethic.- Weapon and stage choices are limited. It would be amazing if you could improve the roster of both.- Health packs are very overpowered. They need to be reduced in the amount they can heal, or matches can become almost impossible to win and will last forever.- There isn't a button to exit the game as of yet. That is a feature that needs to be implemented; the only way to exit the game right now is to press Alt+Enter and close the game.- There is no online multiplayer. It would be a great addition and is almost required for a game of this style to thrive. If it is implemented, it will appeal to people who don't have others to play with.Glitches Found:- This has been confirmed as a glitch but was kept in because the game wasn't meant to be very serious. When I have been playing Singleplayer mode, I have found that jumping on top of an enemy can send you at least twice as high as normal jumping. I can't tell whether it is due to the damage system or simply a glitch due to collision boxes or maybe even something completely different.Extra Points To Note:- It feels like the controls for the stage and character selection are backwards. This may be a deliberate design choice, but the movement doesn't seem right to me.Conclusion:Overall, I enjoy this game. The creators have done a great job in capturing the feel of a retro game with the art style and soundtrack. The gameplay features are working and strong. There are quite a few things that can be improved, but the developers (Ridhwann Patel, Chuck Obrien and Tanner Daniels, as well as collaboration with New Reality Games) have a very good work-in-progress Steam game on their hands that I will play for hours as new updates come out. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys platformers, fighting games, shooter games and retro-styled games.I will be updating this review when new updates come and if I find something new with the game."

Except, I wish dead6hot could have been better than this. The idea for this game is good. I like fast-paced shooting games, except this game is not fast-paced at all. The enemies take a long time to kill. The weapons don’t act the way they do like in any other game. For example, the pistol works exactly like a machine gun and the shotgun does as much damage as a pistol. Lastly, the game gets repetitive after 5 minutes of gameplay.The versus mode for the game is local only and from what I can tell, it is supposed to justify the bad controls. Whenever I play the versus mode for the game, the match goes on forever. The only way to win is to make sure the opponent never gets a first-aid kit. If they do, it will prolong the match. That isn’t a good way to decide who wins or loses.Aside from the gameplay mechanics, the music is just chiptune garbage that loops every 10 seconds. The graphics look like it is trying way too hard to capture the theme of “retro” when it really just comes off as bland. With a forgettable game that will not let you quit, I wouldn’t recommend Dead6hot nor its prequel Dead5hot to anyone."

This game is so flat, it's not even worth complaining about.  Just getting my cards and moving on to something more enjoyable, like paying my taxes or cleaning the toilet."

The steam trading cards are worth four gems and six cents each. If you purchase the game you and then sell the steam trading cards, there is a two cent net profit. Might as well go outside and find two pennies on the sidewalk or around your couch. Save bandwidth and potentially make a bigger profit.There is not much to comment on gameplay. Move with arrow keys and shoot with O, L, F or C depending if you player one or player two. The game does support local co-op."

,Not Recommended,438030,28949251,Posted: 2 January,all,atomicmutilator,Very simple game. Very little content to actually partake in and keep the game repeatably entertaining. Basic shooter with no interesting concepts. Yet another disappointment under New Reality Games. Slightly regretting buying the the subscription. Should have read more reviews of the games by the studio. R.I.P.
