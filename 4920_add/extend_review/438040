,Recommended,438040,29763502,Posted: 7 February,all,Running-Target,"Shakes and Fidget is a free to play animated webbrowser RPG with asynchronous multiplayer and everything RNG.  It is an international web browser and mobile game, so it will be populated with many other players. This game is translated into many languages, so there will be many Non-English reading players.  It worked on Win 10, looked ok, sounded ok, played ok, was understandable.  It is light on resources used, so it will be runnable on any computer.Has funny quest text and gear descriptions.  The artwork is cartoony and funny. Has varied weapon sounds. Has some animation.  Has a manual and official wiki in english.  Pretty Easy to play.The level cap is 550, but it will take you long time to reach it, very TIME consuming game.  (At my current hours, i have a 149 scout and 135 warrior)  Quests and other things take an amount of real time to complete or cooldown reset.  More time you put into it, the higher you climb on the leaderboard.Mushrooms are the store currency, but you can earn some from quests rewards and gambling.   Some gear cost mushrooms, but you might find the same and better later for gold only or quest reward.   You can spend mushrooms to skip waiting on timers or add time to questing endurance and the best mount.   There is hourglasses that you can buy with gold for skipping the travel time on questing.It has PVP and PVE.  It is RNG combat where better stats and gear will give you some edge, but RNG is a fickle goddess, you still can lose to bad rolls. Difference in Level between you and target is a factor of success. You can make 2? characters per server, picking one of 3 classes ( warrior, mage, scout).  Has an PVP Arena where you have a choice of 3 players to attack for gold, honor and xp.You can raise your all your stats with gold and use potions to temporary improve a stat.   Gear you can buy or get from quests can now be modded in the blacksmith shop and in the tavern watercloset. At level 75, you can collect Pets that improve your stats and you can fight other players pets. There are many other things that you can do to improve your stats.It has 31 dungeons you can unlock and raid.    Finishing Frost Blood Temple Dungeon, you unlock The Tower which gives you three companions (Mage, Scout, Warrior) to raid with through 15 harder dungeons that unlock with the Tower.  You have to outfit your three companions with gear to improve their stats.  But ends up having to wait for your level to catch up to the dungeon level.You can make your own fortress, with some buildings that improve your character and other building for protecting your fort or raiding others forts.  You can raid other players forts for resources and pour your gold in to defending your fort.   It has Guilds and guild wars, where guild members all attack other guilds or defend from other guild's attacks.  Guilds have stuff they can build that increases gold and xp gain for guild members.  But above level 25 guild upgrades require someone that Buys mushrooms.  You can increase your guild level also by completing guild house raids.The 17 plus servers are located in Europe somewhere (Central Europe time zone).  Devs keep adding more servers, which pulls active players from the established servers.  Leading a guild is easy but hard to get enough active dedicated players to reach the very top of the guild leaderboard.  Make several accounts with 2 characters on same server then make your own guild and put all your own alts in it, then don't bother with recruiting other people to guild.Try it, maybe you might like it.  You can play this game for free, and it keeps you busy serveral hours a day.For more info:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPxB3akHTwkhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09uN1BUHlN8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CySxFXxiPkhttps://mmos.com/review/shakes-and-fidgethttp://www.gamespot.com/forums/pc-mac-linux-society-1000004/shakes-and-fidget-27249202/http://www.mmosquare.com/games/reviews/shakes-and-fidgethttp://www.gamingobserver.com/shakes-and-fidget-pc-review/"
,Recommended,438040,30090044,Posted: 21 February,all,Novi,"IntroPlayed this for about 7 years now.This is like a diablo game without having to do the grinding manually.Instead, you send out your character on a quest using your limited energy per day, have the game running in the background and when it's done, you collect your xp/gold/whatever else dropped. Even the battles (there's one at the end of each quest for example) are automated and you can choose to skip them (they are decided by stats and some randomness - blocking, dodging, critical attacks, damage ranges etc.).WarningThis game is pay to win. But at the same time, I'm actually not bothered by this. Let me explain. In this game, there is a currency called mushrooms. You can actually get these randomly for free, but not enough to buy all the extra energy you can each day. More energy means you can do more quests and if you can do more quests per day, you will level up and increase your attributes faster. But you also have to put more time into it. The energy you are given is enough to take a couple hours each day (of course, again, mostly having the game running in the background while doing something else), so even if I could, I definitely wouldn't spend more time than that every day. That would just burn me out.Also, the progression of others might as well be irrelevant to you if you're not too bothered about leaderboards. There are plenty of other things to do in this game other than straight up pvp.The other uses of mushrooms aren't all that important and don't really give much of an edge in pvp.As a last note, there is a special ""donatable"" version of mushrooms, which are needed to donate to a guild. There didn't use to be, but now there is a way to get these for free as well (though the regular drops don't count). I would assume (seeing as I have over 360 of these myself), that if everyone in a guild chips in with these, this isn't an issue at all.Notable pros+ Over the years, the game received and continues to receive big updates. I'm talking entirely new features that add more and more layers of what you can actually do in this game, like the fortress (building a base, attacking other people's bases = new leaderboard entirely), pets (which you have to find first, you level them up and use to fight other people's pets), etc. Usually I'm just content doing my grinding and progressing dungeons and other stuff, but whenever one of these is announced, I'm legitimately excited.+ You can play it on your phone (using your PC account), so that you don't miss your day's grinding if you're away or something. Or there's also the browser version, which came originally, for when you don't want your friends to know you play this and stop talking to you (jk).+ No limits. Technically, there is a level cap (500), but I don't think anyone in the world hit that yet and it could get increased like it did once (I play on one of the oldest servers). You can increase your stats for gold to infinity, get better equipment, gems, etc. Basically, there really isn't an endgame to this. The dungeons and bosses in these are static, not randomly generated btw. and I think nobody has beaten them all yet. There's always some next challange you're looking to beat.Notable cons- P2W (see Warning section for more explanation) - you're gonna hit that top 10 pvp leaderboard only if you have more money and time than god. Even if you don't care about that, you're going to progress dungeons slower.- This game is repetitive. Duh. Like every game about grinding. You're gonna do your set of daily chores (and by now there's a lot, but you can do them simultaneously - while questing, spin that wheel of fortune, get those arena and pet battles done etc.) and then usually be glad that's done."

,Recommended,438040,29417491,Posted: 22 January,all,MockingFlame,"Yes, as stated in other reviews the game rewards you for reviewing it. I hope it doesn't notice this review as I rather not take advantage of that ?feature?. I find the game to be rather good. It has its glaring issues. The fact they think rewarding someone for leaving a good review is a good idea is just one of them.It has the sense of being a mp game. Though there is little actual player interaction possible. I enjoy the small level that is possible and find I interact with other players much more then I do in other games. Taking part in the pvp, guilds, etc. Which I skip in most the other online games I've played.The pay model seems to be pay for convenience. As all I have seen that they accept realy world money for is to buy a currency in game called mushrooms. Mushrooms are given in game as well. There are even weekend events where every other quest rewards randomly adds a mushroom. The mushroom can be used various ways in game. Though the game has other currencies that it uses for things. Mushrooms don't replace those currencies. They might be added to them though, from time to time. There are a few things that can only be purchased with mushrooms. From what I have seen though those can all be gotten just by not playing the game for a extended period of time. As timers will take into account when the game is not running that is a valid option that I find myself using often.It is best to play it while doing something else. As much of the game  involves waiting to be able to commit another action. I tend to play it while watching videos or playing other games that take waiting on.The biggest issue I have with ""Shakes and Fidget"" is the stamina system. It seemes like I could do a ton of quest per day before I was worn out for that day when I was a low level. Now I am only level fourteen and can barely do a handful of quests before my stamina bar depletes. The only way I have found to refill the bar is to use mushrooms to regain a little stamina. That has a hard limit too. I can only use ten mushrooms a day for regaining stamina. Which means for the longest section of day I can't do quests.Overall I find it to be worth playing. I strongly recomend it to people that have very little ""free"" time. Especially if they are able to play this while they are doing other things they need to do."

76561197985549795,Not Recommended,438040,29728021,Posted: 5 February,all,Geppetto,"This game is really bad, first off...Mages are rediculously OP, I played as one and destroyed my opponents that were 2x my lvl, I also played a fighter and was destroyed by mages EVERY TIME...If my arena choices were all mages, I could not beat any of them. The pvp system pits you constantly against higher lvl opponents..my mage was fine at lvl 6 beating lvl 12 opponents, my fighter never stood a chance vs mages.. Second of all if you run out of the ""thist for adventure meter"", which allows you to do quest, it does NOT regen on it's own..you HAVE to spend thier ""mushroom"" currency to refill it.. if you run out of mushrooms and exaust your questing meter and do not want to pay $ for mushrooms to play the game, it is literally done for you.  The combat system is lame and is just a take turns hitting each other system, there is no strategy involved at all...the point of a mage is that yea, you do lots of damage, but if you get hit it's really bad for you right?... Not in this game.. There is literally no benifit or hinderence to being a subposed ""ranged"" character because you just take turns hitting each other so the bigger dps wins most of the time if they just put a few points into HP.. example..my lvl 6 mage with 587 hp beat a lvl 9 fighter with over 2800 HP by criting him for over 1380 dmg..The translation from German is really bad.. the manual on how to play is writen in German.  You as a player have no idea how to unlock the dungeons because the tooltips do not tell you how.  The game could be so much more, but it's just really bad in the state it is in.. Don't waste your time on this one."

It is a model of a casual game that does not bother you to 'achieve' and yet you feel satisfied with your achievements.All those funny pictures and humorous quirks are not the game's main asset. The best thing about it is that it is easy, it helps you to relax and take a break from other challenging games.Many players quit it. I played a couple of hours to find out my character is stronger than 76% of players. That means many early quitters.I believe, most players quit ""Shakes and Fidget"" after first couple of days while finding it ""too slow"".If you have an urge to quit it too, think again. The problem is not in this game, the problem is in you. You are in a rush. This game rewards you for not being in a rush.Enjoy it as you enjoy a nice cup of tea or an afternoon nap, You will feel good about it."

Not worth it.EDIT: I just found out that the creators were paying off people to provide this sack of♥♥♥♥♥♥game with positive reviews. There is absolutley no game here whatsoever. You can't even call this a goddamn clicker game because it lacks any sort of goal. In order for a video game to be a clear and precise video game is that it needs to kow what it's doing. Shakes and Fidget does the opposite of that. It may be entertaining for the first hour but then you have to start waiting longer and longer to do the dungeons it just gets frustrating.

76561198171667667,Recommended,438040,29911093,Posted: 13 February,all,admiral_Flunkica,"*****IF you expect deep insight into the game don't bother, I'm not sure as far as spoilers go in games without stories but minor spoilers included (probably)****Well first of all I was motivated to write this review(my first) by a promise of 5 mushrooms (in game currency)... (although it did say rate, so maybe I'm mistaken, think I got the mushroms though so I'll be a good sport and write something) *edit* here I would like to say that 5 in game currency is not much and the review is not positive because of this, it is positive because i really like this game hence the 55h+ game time*First glance, I like this game, it's nice, it's casual and it helps me relax (except when it frustrates me, but it doesn't do it often so it's ok, trust me). The main components are questing (gold and exp grinding with a touch of gear drops), the dungeons (challenging oponents that make all the grind worth it), and pvp fights (for honor&glory, with honor determining the position in the rankings, I made up the glory part). There is the guild feature which allows you to socialize with different players and has it's own rewards. At this point I haven't accessed the full features of the game(castle and pets) so I can't say much about them.It's basically every rpg once you passed the main story and have only the grinding part left, except, here you don't have to actually run around the map, find distant areas, kill swarms of monsters, or push a lot of buttons.To keep the spoilers minimal, the initial progress is a bit slow but it gets fun and exciting afterwards. The quests don't require a lot of attention and I like this type of games since they can be played in the background(usually in the mornings when my brain is still booting). The in-game currency can be purchased but it is also obtainable from questing and other sources so it doesn't make such an great impact. I don't believe this to be an play for free but pay to win type of game since paying will mostly just speed things up but will not give you unbelievable boosts, and I don't feel like I'm missing out on alot for not paying (although maybe you should ask me on that in a few weeks from now when i get to levels where waiting is frustrating). As for that, quests have time durations and you can basically sit back and fiddle your fingers while the time doesn't run out. So if you are impatient types maybe this game is not for you.Battles are instantanious and while you do not actively participate i found the waiting and anticipation thrilling, especially when you are on your death door and hope the next hit will be a crit for win...I do not have a lot of negative stuff to say, because the concept of the game is simple enough and at this point it has not let me down, I'm looking forward to the new stuff and features (level unlockable) and hope it will not let me down. Maybe a background story would be nice but then again I'm grinding clicker heroes so what do I know.I am not a Chinese robot paid to write this reviewAlso I'll probably regret not reading it before posting, but the bed awaits and to parafraze what a ""wise"" man i know once told me, sleep is good!"
