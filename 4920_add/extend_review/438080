,Not Recommended,438080,22540443,"Posted: 20 April, 2016",all,Влади́мир Влади́,"This is the best Poseidon simulator on market.But nothing else beyond that.A quick message to the developer(s): it looks like you might have talent in making stuff, but this is not the game to glorify it.The review:The gameplay is plain and boring, esentially you use 2 keys to control the waves your surfer... surfs. It's easy to understand, but it gets really bull♥♥♥♥♥♥ once you reach later levels. That being level 2. It's bad.The start is PAINFULLY slow and your surfer's speed accelerates way too fast, as by the time you reach twenty waves, your head will get very dizzy.About those waves I mentioned earlier, that's the scoring system. The more waves you passed succesfully, the higher the score. However, once you reach a set amount, you'll switch levels, and boy oh boy, the difficuly curve gets ridiculous.The soundtrack consists of 2 songs. Two. You heard right: the menu and the gameplay. That's it. The one on the gameplay side starts off well once you play this the first time, but gets extremely irritating once you have to restart over and over and over again.There are unlockable characters to choose from, all of them locked a score rating OR you could buy them with stars that are somehow scattered within the waves. Most of them are just masochistic to get via the score route, so you'll end up using the stars, which are plentiful if you enjoy playing. Also, some of them are unique, and make the game even harder than it is. yay.That concludes it. If you are willing to buy this, here's my tip:Turn. That. Piece of sh!t of gameplay song. Off. And put something else.If you are wondering why I have 2 hours invested in this is because I wanted those bloody cards and I tried my best to find something redeemable within this. Nope.In the end, spend your money somewhere else and don't buy everything steam coupons give you."

Maybe it's the one song starting over and over again, maybe it's just me, whatever.+Steamcards + low price (on sale) = free game to your library-Repetitive gameplay + non-existent multiplayer = boring game+Steam achievements - but they are too hard, srsly.+Gaben skin - involves crapton grind time.Overall it's a good buy but not very fun game."
,Recommended,438080,23552452,"Posted: 14 June, 2016",all,solarPULSAR | SteaмLadder.com,"As I get older I tend to enjoy casual games more than I used to, so personally I don't mind this trend of mobile games or ports coming to steam at low prices. For 50 cents, this game is definitely worth it. The gameplay, while nothing revolutionary, is very fun and challenging. The developer also was smart enough to have the game run at 60fps natively, so the developer did not mistep there as far as im concerned. The menu options are also sufficient for a game like this. The most impressive part of this game is that there seems to be no screen tearing even at high speeds which is also a plus for a game like this. My only complaints would be that there is only one song in the game, and it can get tiring listening to it. The game also supports online multiplayer and local versus, which is something i've seen a few mobile-to-pc devs include lately which is welcome. Now if I could only find another friend to play it with."

Trust me. I tried.*Appears to have a variety of levels as you progress, so as long as you don't completely suck the gameplay doesn't get too too staleNeutral:*In the 3 hours it took to get all of the trading cards I still never unlocked Gaben.*I even speedhacked and I still died.Cons:*The FOV is almost nausiating. Not being able to see much in front of you both prevents planning and also gets really uncomfortable/fazed over time. Probably because it's a mobile port...*There's like 1.5 music tracksVerdict:If you somehow ended up with this in your library or got a 90% off coupon and are wondering, it's definitely worth playing to get those trading cards.

,Not Recommended,438080,22486807,"Posted: 17 April, 2016",all,TigerTrix,"(1/5 star) Really shallow gameplay.  If you liked Timberman, then you'd like this.  Just timing up/down to keep the water platforms connected.  I got bored after 5 minutes.  Just no incentive to keep going other than to beat your best score.  I would have much preferred if it had some jumps, air time, or let you see a few waves ahead to plan your moves (like tree limbs in timberman), or something to add some thrill.  Or perhaps only having to match up with higher waves to the right, and let him shoot off a wave if higher.  But he just crashes if your wave (platform) is higher than the next.  Seems like some more depth could have been added.  Just way too boring to me.  Timberland was actually slightly more engaging, and had a more active online multiplayer (at this time)."

Overall experience is really average, because you have only two choices, which are to play either singleplayer or multiplayer, which is not bad for games like this one, but still in my opinion something else should be added to it ( for example game editor mode or level maker to create you own levels). Also it would be great to add extra things like checkpoints and different difficulties (easy, hard, e.t.c). I would rate this game 6/10 and will recommend to play it if you really got nothing else to do. Otherwise, don't buy this game."

Riding a wave is a very dynamic experience in that the shape of the surface, speed and balance are constantly changing in a somewhat random fashion.  This game encapsulates those aspects in an enjoyable gaming experience.  If you have never surfed and want an idea of how your brain is stimulated by it, this is a fair approximation.  It's about a buck at full price and worth every penny.  I'm stoked to own it!"

But the gameplay ends there. You collect stars, but they don't serve the game. The collisions are a little wonky.A couple pieces of extra mechanics could have made it better. I understand wrecking into a higher piece of terrain, but why can't you drop from a wave? A cool down so you couldn't do it consecutively would have made it more interesting. If you get a star combo, the character could jump a wave you missed once per combo (to incentivize going for them). And no way to save progression. Making sure you'll be very familiar with the aesthetic of the first part of the first level and nothing else.It could have been good, but it isn't. Even for only a few bucks."

The controls are very simple: up or down makes the waves go up or down while your surfer glides across them.  The surfer keeps moving until you make a mistake and then it's game over.This game is fast, it might be a bit too fast because I feel dizzy when I play it.  It's kind of a zen feeling though so I kind of like it in a way.  The music is exactly what you hear on the store page.
