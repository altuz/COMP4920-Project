It's unfortunate because the formula they have is actually pretty good.UPDATE: Shortly after the posting of this review, I found myself IP-banned from the game. Cannot even access their website. The VRChat video of the banning also was ""banned"" from their community page.TLDR of the video: Someone else's actions resulted in a mass-banning of the entire world. This is not the way to generate a fanbase."

Damn.This game is in an early stage but already well polished. No lags, fun mini games, no stuttering (neither graphics or sound / microphones are lagging). I didn't use VR that much lately, but this one will surely add some hours playtime."

And also a bunch of social VR apps, incl. Altxxxxx, HiFi and some others. This one I have to say blows ALL these experiences out of the water - by miles!Let me see. Today, this Friday night...I have been in a giant show which was excellently done with anime dancers. I climbed about a mile up in the sky with some people and then we dropped down. I have been in some sort of anime/game forest. I have been in a bowling alley which appeared very real, complete with 50s music and disco light :) I have been in a bar with about 20 people and a bar tender busy running around and serving drinks. I have been in an abandoned prison with scary ghosts, traps and all kinds of stuff. We have played games like CTF and we've been in an old Western town where we were the Sherrifs and shot some bad Bandit dudes :)A lot of fun also with people showing off their insanely creative avatars. I took my headset off later on and realized that I ""experienced"" more things in one single night than a normal person could ever experience in ""real life"" in a night, uh..a week or a month even. This is just frickin' awesome beyond words.From a technical point of view, the avatars are excellent and VRchat even allows making and importing your own from Unity. Lip sync, eye tracking and all. Some of the best avatars I have ever seen. The entire system seems polished and runs smooth.VRChat must have hundreds of ""worlds"" including games etc. to choose from since you can browse them for an half an hour and still didn't see them all. This is crazy. Uh, that being said people can also design their own worlds and games and put them in there. Possibilites: Endless. MIND. BLOWN.And the people are ALL extremely friendly and supportive etc.This is VR as good as it can get with TONS of fun and infinite things to do. Seriously it's mind-blowingly good."

The only thing I would recommend for the devs is in the smooth locomotion mode to make it ""hand based"" orientation like Onward does it as opposed to ""head based"" turning. It makes me feel a bit off when I turn my head while moving forward and my direction changes. If dev is reading check out the difference in Arizona Sunshine's new locomotion update to see what I am talking about. I would also recommend slowing the forward locomotion down 20% or so."

For the most part, the game has been a good experience, with some very nice people who don't mind helping you with uploading avatars and making rooms, etc. There are games and different worlds to visit but this is mostly a social game.VR headsets are not required, but one of the games will need the VR headset. There's a tenpin bowling game, this is a casual game where you can just walk in and play at anytime. Another game has you bouncing a ball off walls in a small arena so that you can hit the other player to knock them out. You are also equipped with shields. This one seems the most interesting out of the bunch, but it requires a VR headset.There is also a basketball court where you can try to get the ball into the hoop, not easy. There is a baseball game but i've not seen anyone play it yet.There is a wild west type First Person Shooter and a few other similar ones, they are fun but it's better with a VR headset i would imagine. Right now the mouse controls are too sensitive to play, but you can still play.There are a few rooms that have pencils, which you can use to draw in mid air, neat.Most rooms have youtube video interaction, you can search for videos to play or just listen to the default playlist. There's a bug where it sometimes automatically changes the video back to the default ones. It would be good if you could select playlists to play while searching. As of now the music automatically plays it's own playlist set by the room creator.It's begging for a chat box, it doesn't have any kind of chat function at the moment. That is my main problem with it, since i don't really like to use a mic.It's in Early Access but is 100% free, you wont be charged for avatars, rooms, or anything else. To create a room or avatar you need Unity, it takes a while to learn, i recommend watching VRPills tutorial video. Some kind of avatar sharing would be nice to have in future, but for now there is a selection of default ones and the ones you can create with Unity.Installing is easy, the game downloads each room seperately so no lengthy download times. When the creator of a room updates the room it has to be downloaded again, but that is only a mild issue, and mainly effects those with poor download speeds.As a whole, i think this social game is pretty good, i've played games like Second Life, Google Lively, and a few others, none of them impressed me as much as this one has. There's no harm in trying it, so try it..."

I have been a member of VRchat for over two years, and the community is what makes this place so special. Each ""room"" in VRchat is a direct upload of a scene in Unity (software used to create most VR experiences). This makes it very easy for community members to upload new rooms and content. The developers of VRchat are also making the games they have (Capture the Flag, Battle Discs, etc) available in the SDK. This means over the next few months anyone can adapt these games and create new versions of them!VRchat is a great way to gain exposure to Unity/development...but you can also just have fun and talk to others here. Other social VR apps don't even compare in that feeling of community you get when you log in. Our meetups are on Sundays, but since its public release there have been people logged in continuously.Come join our community, and see for yourself what makes this such a special place!"

I've played it for well over an hour and already had lots of fun. The people I've met have been very welcoming and friendly. So far I've only tried two minigames (discs and wild west) and both of them were well designed, bug free and simply fun to play.I've played a few other social games (e.g. Rec Room, AltSpaceVR) but VR Chat exceeds both those games in my mind.

Honestly you need to get in this game as fast and possible. The Devs treat you like a actual human, I say this meeting and personaly talking and hanging with them. I send nights just chilling with devs 1 on 1 or with others, There the best I have only meet VRPILL,Mechlaid,Kirito,Gunther, Somewhat Violet. There the best I got to say I'm telling you once you play this you won't ever need to play another game. Honestly I'm not plainning on playing anymore games or buying anyothers. Endless its series I play before that are coming out with new games cause memorys. I do have to say I'm only on desktop as of now, But even if I am I'm having loads of fun talking etc. A few things to note there updating the game constintly adding new things, Avatar Creation and World Creation very tricky and complcated I don't recommend you try to make one right away if you never dealt with, Unity,Belnder,Maya,Cinmea4D cause you will be very confused. Though there are videos online that can put your mind set in the right direction taking you someone step by step. But you could always ask staff,devs etc for help even people with avatars already, But keep in mind even if they have avatars they may or may not know hwo to help you. Its still pretty difficult to make one. But what really put this game on the top is its open source anything within the games rules is allowed I say ask the devs what your planning before doing so. The hub consintly being checked on , Also this is a E for everyone game so keep in mind its for kids also. So in the hub you got watch what your saying my first day in the game someone got banned for loads of not okay words to say if you get my drift. Scripting is not allowed yet but that will be soon there working on it as I write this all in all 100/100 as of now.Do you recommend this game? 100% Yes"

Otherwise you're left hoping the game picks up the correct device (in my case it does not).VR Control leaves quite a lot to be desired. When I played EVE Valkyrie, it was amazingly simple and easy to adjust as you could hit a button to re-center / re-calibrate the forward-looking direction. VRChat seems to assume that the sensor is directly in front of you, with no way of re-calibrating or re-centering it, I did happen across what seemed to ""recenter"" the VR headset but when trying to walk forward, well... I personally know my left from my right, and my front from my back, but the game doesn't.In addition, I checked the options and ""Gamepad"" is checked as though it is enabled, but is greyed out as though it is disabled, and unable to use a gamepad to play as shown in the store page/options.All of that said, I would like to see the direction this game goes and would recommend it if some more basic functionality was corrected to allow users to handle things a bit better."

Some of these worlds offer pretty fun competive multiplayer games, like capture the flag or gold with either laser pistols or six shooters (depending on the game) other experiences are in sight and sound, like multiple movie theater spots (where you can use your Youtube to play the content you desire), presentations rooms, etc.  There is so much to explore and/or create it is awesome.

The IK system for the avatars works really well especially if you find an avatar with proportions similar to your own body.ProsStays pretty active with between 20-50 people at almost any time of day (pretty good for vr multiplayer)Devs and moderators are really active, helpful, and love to show off what VRChat can offerA few good CTF style games to play and Tron discsOpen to user-generated rooms so there could be more really fun stuff coming out soonEasy to grab people from the hub and have them join you in a gameEasy to see what people are already playing or hanging out inIts totally freeThere are rooms where you can hang out and watch youtube videos with peopleIf a room is full, you can easily create a new instance of that room for new people to joinConsYou need a pretty good understanding of Unity to create your own content (devs/community are making tutorials though)Can sometimes be buggy/drop frames but not too oftenNot as popular/active as Rec RoomThere arent currently a ton of fun gamesNo user market place or workshop so you can easily download new avatars/etc (i think devs are considering it currently)All things considered, VRChat is pretty dang amazing and a good spot to hang out and chat with people or play some fun games."

,Recommended,438100,29975776,Posted: 16 February,all,Majik Bear,"As a furry, being able to present myself using an anthro character in VR is very important to me. So far this is the only app (other than Anyland which is just too much going on to be useful) where I can create and upload an avatar that represents how I prefer to see myself. It's quite new, so the process of creating and uploading an avatar is still very complicated and buggy. Many people complain that they upload avatars and they can select them, but they never rez. There's also the thing where you have to map every individual part of your body that moves (including each individual finger) to your avatar in the Unity application before you can upload it. On another note, the things you can do in this VR space are fairly limited and static: There's never anything new, so the few demo worlds that are available are all you get, and it gets boring quickly. It's like the devs just arrived at a point where they went ""okay this is enough content, we're done."" At the moment there's no way to change the luminosity of other avatars, so you've got those people who will crank the luminosity to maximum on their models so they glare in your face like direct sunlight. You've also got people who will make gigantic room-filling avatars and stand there waving their arms around in groups of people. While this app is an excellent concept, I see the freedom people have with avatar creation being stifled quite a bit because the way it is now just isn't scalable; the potential for abusive avatars palpable. Basically imagine all the problems jerks cause inSecond Life, but now it's all around you in 3D space."
,Recommended,438100,29976048,Posted: 16 February,all,Pathfinder,"A fun pioneering environment for creating shared experiences and experiencing surreal encounters with a wide range of humanity. Creative-minded folks can use the free Unity editor to import avatars and create shared virtual environments.  It's fun to run on the desktop, but you really need to try it in VR for the full immersive effect.In short, VRChat is full of friendly helpful people, thoughtful role-players, goofballs, storytellers, casual chatters, and all of them part of a supportive community working to build a shared dream."

Feels like they're trying to cater to either an audience of SJWs or people under 10 years old. Also, the game has glitches which have been present in it for the 2 years before it came to Steam. Want to fly? No problem, just jump off a cliff and continually press whatever button you have bound to forward. Did you work hard on rigging a character to play as in the game? Too bad for you, the moderator is triggered by your avatar and will ban you from the game if you don't change it."

It is the World’s Fair 24/7 and I’m always looking forward to see what new content users have brought in.   I can’t wait to see what the community will do with game modifications.While still in Early Release, VRChat does have its kinks here and there but the team is dedicated to quickly working those out.  This is the only social VR platform I have found so far that is truly living up to my expectations on what I hoped the metaverse would be.
