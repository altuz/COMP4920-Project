Walls you can jump off of have similar issues.Now for nitpicks: Ammo is not reset on death. This led to an annoying section during the final boss, where I died with no bullets. Because bullets are required to break the boxes containing more ammo and health, the fight was nearly impossible without exiting to menu and coming back.Horizontal inputs for the level select menu register as two pushes, so selecting an even numbered level on a 5x5 grid can be very hard, unless you use the mouse.Jumping up into invisible death plains for previous sections of the level is possible.Health pickup sound effect is a blatantly stolen 1-UP effect from Super Mario Bros."
,Recommended,438180,20793059,"Posted: 27 January, 2016",all,Tuminure,"Just beat the last boss and I have mixed feelings.I really enjoyed the graphics and music in it game. Few levels was fun enough to say they were good. Some parts of game mechanics like character movement are really enjoyable.What I found annyoing was level design. I really hated when I just have nothing more to do than just jump into the spikes. I also hated the very last jump in last level where you need to be very precise and double jump correctly. I found myself often jumping to death just because I don't know if I can jump there or not.And the bugs... some of them were fun (backwards dash looks funny), some of them not (stuck on that green moving platform with spikes). I also couldn't get my gamepad working - it worked at the beginning but I couldn't set my x/y axis after I changed settings to default by mistake so I ended up playing this on keyboard. The game also crashed once (between levels 2 and 3 afair).If that would be 4.99€ (or more) game then I would say a big NO to this game. I bought it for 0.59€ and I consider it a fair price for that. So yeah, I'm going to recommend it."
,Not Recommended,438180,21142450,"Posted: 11 February, 2016",all,Banjooie,"The one good part about this game is that the controls are relatively tight.Hit detection is a joke. The sound effects are either royalty free or literally the Mario 1 UP noise. It's impossible to tell the difference between a wall that can and cannot be wall jumped. (This is only mostly true. SOME walljumpable walls are marked, but not all of them.) The amount of damage enemies do is seemingly unrelated to what they are. Stationary spikes are a heart and a half. Moving smashy spike columns are half a heart.Some enemies will hurt you when you jump on them, but also take damage. It's impossible in many cases to tell when a cliff will lead to more level or will instantly kill you. It has a lives system with coins, but the lives and coins don't carry over between levels. The final boss gives you 100 bullets, but those bullets don't refresh between lives, though the final boss's health -does-. This game takes less than an hour to beat. Pursuant: I have, in fact, beaten the game.The background art is pretty good, but the other tilework is terrible. Enemies can have the same sprite, but vastly different mechanics and different health. You have to manually select the next level after you beat a previous one.The 'beat the game' art is actually worse than the title screen graphic. Of the guns you can get, one of them is an actual upgrade, and one of them shoots three shots (which you will never need) for three times the ammunition, which is acceptably sparse to begin with except for when you get a million ammo in areas with like three enemies.The box physics are horrendous. In one level, I pushed a box down a thin shaft, and it got stuck halfway. Boxes on moving platforms will skitter around like nervous squirrels, and none of the puzzles are interesting enough to merit there even being box-pushing in the first place.There's an enemy that is basically a koopa troopa, but not a single level ever puts you in a situation to use this to your advantage, or against you. It's there just for the sake of being there.TL;DR Quite literally everything in this game that is not 'controlling Super Mustache' is achingly bad."

Great game to let off some steam (Ha, get it? Steam? Why do I try?) or to explore a different genre. I know most people's librarys these days are mostly just FPS games like COD, Battlefield, and CS, so games like this are fun to play inbetween, a little breather from the fast-paced action of AAA games.Pros:Great graphics.Graphics really complimented by the music!Fun to play with good mechanics.Cons:As I played, I could'nt help but think, ""Hey, this reminds me of Mario! Hey, So does this! Hey! This reminds me of M... Metroid!(Caught you off guard, didnt I?)In conclusion, this is a great project, and it is worth every penny."

Head stomping? Boring. If you aren't going to add a new mechanic or some twist that shakes up the old formula, I wouldn't advise doing it at all.They do mix in elements from other platformers such as double-jumping and more of a life meter, but it all feels very sterile. The controls and platforming is quite rigid. The music is generic, and the pixel art is real 'meh'.Pros:+It is cheap, and isn't overwhelmed with bugs (there were a few, though, in the little time I played).Cons:-Why the shoddy partial controller support? This is a game that should either be fully supported, or not. Don't make me get off the couch to select the level by pushing 'enter'.-Nothing fresh at all here. They bring nothing new to the table. In fact, most of what is here is a direct rip (hence the title, I suppose).-Environment and game overall feels sterile.-I could go on, but the above covers the big things.My gripe obviously isn't about the price - my gripe is that this isn't worth your time to install and play.Peace,"

As a fan of platformer games I went into this game hoping for a Hidden Gem for only $0.99.  It sort of reminded me of 8BitBoy with the style and controls, however this game did have a few ""glitchy"" moments.  On more thna one occasion I got stuck on the wall and had to restart the level.  As well as an issue with some blocks getting stuck against a wall and not falling where they need to.  The overall gameplay though was fun and once I got used to the jumping/controls, it made for an enjoyable experience.I would say the higlight of this game would be the soundtrack, it is solid and really helped keep pushing me to finish the game.  It's not a long game at all, but for the price I totally recommend it.  I would say this game is something that can be completed in 1 hour or less once you get used to the gameplay mechanics.Social MediaTwitter -https://twitter.com/kovicplayzYoutube -https://www.youtube.com/kovicplayzTwitch -https://www.twitch.tv/kovicplayz/profile"

I've been playing it a lot recently for my Let's Play videos on my YouTube channel, and going through it for the first time is really exciting and sometimes difficult. Super Mustache is only 99 cents, but I was able to get it for 66 cents due to a coupon I obtained. Honestly, for it's price and awesomeness definitely would rate this game 9/10.It's like a futuristic Mario in some ways, and having a laser rifle at times is pretty epic. I'm hoping they release some sort of DLC or Super Mustache 2! Would definitely pay money for them. To conclude, the story ain't all bad either, you're a Captain from Earth trying to stop Gladius and Uranus from taking over the universe. Pretty legitimate."

I finished the game in 66 minutes.Other than that the game has some odd bugs such as the critters not dying/receiving damage when you bounce on them and you get damage or fall straight through instead, boxes behave very weirdly at times with a very broken push/pull and 'physics' system.The boss is also very lackluster, only 2 moves and a hybrid of the two, one of which is extremely abusable on your side (just jumping on the boss' head gives him damage) and for the other you just have to dodge. It's a ridiculously easy boss once you realize what you have to do.Overall the game is fine if you don't expect much for $1, which is what you should be doing anyway really, but other than that it's not even worth it. I had more fun with  more polished flash games on Newgrounds."
,Not Recommended,438180,22486205,"Posted: 17 April, 2016",all,TigerTrix,"(2/5 star) I liked this at first.  It is a super mario clone with OK controls, but ramps up the timed jump difficulty pretty quickly, which I find more frustrating than fun.  Personally, I'd prefer if it were easier.  The character control was decent, but not great.  It felts a lot more like playing a mario knock-off from the old Commadore64 days, but a little tigher and modern graphics.  I rather enjoyed levels 1-4.  But I grew frustrated with the timed jumps required in the 2nd half of level 5, and suddenly it wasn't fun anymore.  I had really hoped the fun wouldn't end until later levels.It worked fine with an xbox360 gamepad, but first thing had to remap the buttons via its menus to something more intuitive to me (A=jump, B=dash, X=fire).  The level select screen doesn't support gamepad, but it works everywhere else.  Also the continue screen only registered Y to select (with my configuration, but wasn't a button to configure)."

It's clunky, unpolished, buggy, and full of half-baked ideas.PROS:- Occasionally interesting and fun level design.MIDDLE GROUND:- Costs a dollar.- Short but long enough.CONS:- Level select menu is broken.- Game controls are fairly janky, but don't hinder the gameplay too much.- Levels are clearly made using a basic level-creation software.- Boring space-ship segments (they're duller than they sound).- Level mechanics are inconsistantly used or displayed.- Wonky physics and block-moving mechanics that don't work properly.- I'm fairly certain that 1-up sound was stolen from Super Mario World.SCORE: 4/10*Super Mustache is part of the ""Back in Time"" bundle (offered by Back to Basics Gaming), which also features Neon Hardcorps and Star Drifter.

A very fun and short platformer that really does make you feel nostalgic for those good ol 2D super nintendo games.Only complaints is that the games controls are set up a bit weird but you can personalize them to your taste. A few problems include getting stuck on objects and dying out of nowhere, but there problems are minor and there's not a constant flow of inconviences. Plus, this game is fairly new and I am certain those problems will be addressed. I wouldn't recommend this game  if you have a problem with reused content.

Is the kind of game play you would expect to find on the app store for your phone for free.  Story is bare minimum with an opening cutscene and a 'You win' screen at the end.  Finished the game start to finish in apparently 66 minutes including getting up to get a drink about halfway through.Graphics are borderline terrible.  Assets are heavily inspired or stolen from games like Mario (Thwomps).  Music is short loops that get very old very quickly.  Sound effects are bare minimum required and even the 1-up sound from Mario is re-used.There is little to no replay value at all in this game.  No secrets to find, no hidden items.  For $0.59, I'm disappointed somehow.  I ran into a couple of glitches.  Boxes needed to hold down switches and stuff getting stuck in the wall or not falling through the slot they are supposed to and having to spend a minute or two fidgeting around them to get them to go.  At one point I lost the ability to bounce on enemies, which was somewhat of a problem since it was at a point where you have to bounce on enemies to cross a gap.The best part of this game was one of my cats loved the animations and sat with me pawing my screen, and it was cute."

,Recommended,438180,31489992,Posted: 1 May,all,Fresh Greek JPEG,"Before I start this review, I would like to say that I haven't played this game a lot. I bought it 2 days ago, so I'll judge it from my experience as of now.Alright so, starting off, I would like to mention the fact that this game was made with the Unity engine. It's really good for any kind of games, especially 2D.Now, the story of this game in a nutshell: A robot has been sent from Earth into a random planet. Then that robot causes problems against Earth, by enslaving the creatures of that planet and you, Mr. Mustache, have to stop this whole situation. The first level of the game seems very good. The textures and the level design are very good and the same counts for the Mustache guy (he has quite a nice style). The music of the game is pretty good, the same counts for most of the sound effects, except from one of them: the 1-up sound from Mario that's being used in this game. I don't really have a problem with it, since it's just a stupid sound, but it was a bit unexpected from a pay to play game. I usually see this sound effect in Mario online games. And now, let me go to (maybe) the most important aspect of the game that dragged me in even more into playing it: the difficulty. The difficulty in this game is actually really good. It's not too easy, but it's also not too hard. The game doesn't have cheap deaths (which are being used in video games sometimes) and the controls are quite smooth (well not the smoothest of all for me, since I mostly play 8-bit games on consoles, but it's pretty smooth).Overall, it's a game that I totally recommend as of now (I haven't played a lot as I said before). If I finish the game anytime soon, I'll probably change a few aspects of my review. Anyway though, I don't believe that you'll regret it if you buy it, especially right now that the price has dropped (only for 8 more days though).

The advanced AI robot knows what he is doing and started the Urantia regime. Creatures living in the planet do not like what’s happening so Captain Super Mustache has been called to end the reign of Gladius.Super Mustache is an action platformer mobile game with a beautiful 8-bit style graphics and music. It’s one classic game you’d want to play over and over again even after finishing it because it has that same charm as Super Mario. Instead of saving a princess, Captain Super Mustache is sent to save a whole dark planet and its inhabitants!   10/10"

,Not Recommended,438180,20887892,"Posted: 31 January, 2016",all,Graham von Poopenswine,"At first glance, you see a $1 game with fairly decent retro graphics with a catchy soundtrack; however, there is much more to this game than meets the eye. Let me tell you what you are buying. That $1.00 is the amount of effort the developers put into this title, you are getting zero achievements, zero trading cards, zero forum support - the devs don't reply or even listen to their community, and a game with ZERO alpha testing - yes, it's riddled with bugs!You are given the option to rebind controls, but lets face it, you are given 3 buttons to rebind and there are about 8 you use in-game. The controls while playing the game is quite obfuscated, it's not at all obvious on how to move a block back. In Zelda games, Link has a ""Pushing"" animation or ""Pulling"" animation, that doesn't exist in this game. Is that too much to ask??? I have never seen a game where pushing a block could be so frustrating lol, if you don't push a block far enough off a ledge, it'll often land in a spot where you simply cann't push it forward again.This game allows you to shoot bullets and will replenish your ammo with hitting your head off certain floating blocks (lets face it, they are Mario ""coin blocks""...). The first 3 levels are pretty good with giving you ammo, and giving you enemies to kill, but after that, the game focuses more on parkour than defeating enemies. If you like that sort of thing, more power to ya bud! It just seems to me that the weapon you use is a central mechanic in the game that's under used because there either isn't a need to use it (lack of enemies) or you are out of ammo because not enough is given throughout the levels."

Unlike a lot of steam games (espacialy when it comes to platformers)  its average, but this time in a good way. The level design is not really challanging. The graphics look fine. The music is average (nothing that really sticks in your head), and the only real thing I don't like is the sound effects...their annoying and don't fit in with the rest of the game. The price however is good and makes you want to try it out. I like that you can shoot and not just jump on enemies, and with that comes very accessible ammo throughout the levels. Other than a few nit picks this game is great if you have a few dollars left and don't know what to do with it than I would recommend this game to most especially if you like older platformers like me. Also in a fair judgement this game in my opion is a 7.5/10. I hope you enjoy it as much as me."

The aim is ‘Save Uranus’. I enjoyed Super Mustache with the challenges and puzzles along the way. Some of them being quite hard, there was a couple of rage quit moments but not because of a lack of checkpoints or saves. I thank the checkpoints, if it wasn’t for them I wouldn’t have made it through.Check out the rest of my reviewhttp://imagengames.com/super-mustache/"

You play as Captain Super Mustashe sent on a mission to take out a robot named Gladius. Who has taken  control of the planet Uranus. 'nuff said. Its good enough for me. This is like the old school platforms like Megaman including the retro tech music. I like. Sure to frustrate you while you time your jumping, but for a low price and solid fun play with the Dev's obviously have a good sense of humor. You have a laser photon gun/pistol in witch you get upgrades OR you can jump on the alien baddies, up to you. Collect ammo for your gun and coins and hearts throughout the levels. Like the usual platformers jump and navigate and puzzle your way through all sorts of robots/aliens and such to go stop the evil robot Gladius!"

I mean, for example, at level 12 I can only pass through an obstacle if I have my gun upgraded. If I die in this obstacle, I respawn at the checkpoint without the upgrade, and to get it again I need to go way back almost to beginning of level (I found a way much harder to pass without the gun... Sooo try keep the gun). Things sometimes don't get intuitive when it needs, but can be solved with many tentatives.Despite these observations, I recommend it if you want a casual game to take a break from all the FPS and RPG and crazy-long-games-super-wow we play (:"

Like the ones that aren't blocked on your middle school's wifi that you play when you think the teacher won't notice. Only difference is that it has great sound effects. Oh wait. They sure do sound familiar don't they? I got this with a coupon so I got my money's worth. Unless that happens to you I can't recommend it. I could recommend 3 different websites that could give you the same quality gameplay and won't cost you anything. Only buy it if you could profit off of the trading cards like me :3
