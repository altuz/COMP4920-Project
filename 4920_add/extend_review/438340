,Not Recommended,438340,22042985,"Posted: 25 March, 2016",all,Bodomi,"Let me start this review off with saying, I've played my fair share of Walking Simulators, I've played a lot of the games that are very often referred  to as ""Not really a game"", I know what they consist of, I know what to expect, I accept the fact that they contain little to sometimes zero actual content or interaction. I enjoy most of them.But this game? This game does not speak to me positively inalmostany way. It's so boring, there is literally 0 content. There is no interactivity, only automatically triggered events, it is literally a simulator where you walk through a path for 2 hours doing nothing but pressing W, A, S and D. There actually is a button to interact with things, E, but you use it once, you can only use it once in the entire game, you can only interact with 1 thing in the entire game, which is walking to a lever and pressing E.The game is indeed beautiful, nice graphics as always with the Unreal Engine. But the performance of the game is horrid, I have a fairly strong computer, I had horrible FPS(jumping from 20 to 50) at all graphic sliders at medium or less, I even had Shadows at OFF. So to get the best FPS I had to put everything at the lowest setting and view distance at 20. I still had horrible FPS by the way.That destroyed the experience for me in a great way, one of the things I heavily seek in games like this one is the beauty of the game, I enjoy the artwork. I couldn't with this game due to the bad performance.I have no positive things to say about the voice acting, it was cringeworthy to listen to, it was to obvious that the voice actor was reading a script on a piece of paper, I didn't get a sense of any personality, it was blank, you can even hear the voice actor stumble in some sentences, you know, when you stop and start over again and delete that recording, but no, it was included in the game when the voice actor messed up a bit, when they stopped for half a second to start a word over again, it was all left in the game.The game is relaxing though, if you experience ASMR you will most likely experience it here. The rain is nice to listen to, the thunder is nice to listen to, the talking is nice to listen to as white noise while you're reading something on your 2nd monitor while auto walking.No key rebinding, so that's obviously a huge negative. The graphic sliders are not descriptive, it's just Low, Medium, High or, get ready, EPIC! Yea, um, I wan't to know what kind of Anti-Aliasing it is, High AA means nothing, tell me what kind of AA it is.I have to say though, the first path I took(Red) did keep me interested for about an hour but then I dropped of after that, it was to repetitive, there was literally nothing to do other than pressing W, listening to horrible voice acting and a meaningless story while taking screenshots.Pros:Good looking world.Easy game to get 100% achievements in.Cons:Bad voice acting, 0 character.Bad story, you can't relate to anything.Horrible performance, even at the worst possible settings.Literally no content or interactivity.Extremely repetitive, have fun doing both the paths, I hope you have 2 monitors to do something else while you auto-walk.Not worth the price, this game should be free to play or one of those horrible games, which it is, that is priced at 20 cents.I do not recommend this game to anyone, only reason to get this is if you're a person that likes to get 100% achievements in games, this one is an easy target. Other than that, don't buy it.2/10. Giving it 2 due to the fact that it's a half decent world to look at."

I would say a better laptop or PC with a later graphics card would give a more pristine and better result, but Im more than happy with the result I have seen so far ! :)http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=637022609Drizzlepath: Genie is classed as a ""walking simulater"" these types of games are very relaxing and a joy to play. While you are exploring the enjoying the gorgeous scenery and picturesque views, you will also be following a story and listening to a wonderfully voiced lady narrator, she is a real pleasure to listen to, and she does the story telling so very well, also you will listen to some soft tranquil music while progressing through the game. The game will save everytime after the narrator speaks a paragraph of the story as you move further into the country. You will have a choice of 2 paths to take, the red path or the blue path. Once you finish 1 path of the story, you can go down the other path. I have finished the red path, and just started the blue path, and I am so impressed with the stunning scenery through out the game, from what I have seen so far. I feel like Im taking a nice stroll in the country, its so nice and relaxing.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=637025292I think for the work and detail that has gone into this lovely game, its priced very well and worth the full price plus more, but thats my opinion as a game like this would not be easy to bring together so very well.I dont know what else I can say about this game as there are some really well writen reviews that tell a better story than I can about this game. All I can say is The game is Absolutely Stunning, and its a huge Thumbs up from me10/10 A lovely game by far. Well done to the developer. I would very much like to see more wild life added to the game, and or maybe your next game project !. ;)"

As you will walk, and walk, and walk.  The problem is, the gameplay, without anything interesting going on, is fairly awful.  It was just not fun.  There is next to zero interaction which is hardly surprising for a walking simulator, so you need the story to support the game entirely.  This is where it fails.  The poor, monotonous voiceover is hard to listen to, and there's a couple of botched lines where the intonation and flow of the speech is completely out of synch with what the actual dialogue is trying to say.  I did have subtitles on which mercifully allowed me to speed read on and tune the narrator out, but being able to read just highlighted how bad the text is.  It is not a good story, and the ending twist is beyond ridiculous.  Half of the time the narration is overly flowery, non-sensible ravings about mystical beings and the rest is straight forward, to the point railings against religion and faith.Thankfully, and this was key to me actually finishing the game, there is an autowalk feature which I turned on about two thirds of the way through which allowed me to tune out and do other things and just occasionally steer my character up and down the never ending hills.  If you must play I recommend you do not skip over the tutorial messages at the start which tell you about this feature.Graphically, some of the vistas you encounter are fairly decent.  But the graphics as a whole are seriously underwhelming.  Coupled with the fact that nothing ever really happens.  The trailer has pretty much all the interesting parts.  The rest of the time it's just you, trees, hill, the rain, and that godawful narration.  Occasionally you dip into a cave.  The nature based walking simulator equivalent of the FPS sewer levels.Also, supposedly there is a second path you can take which the game informs you of at the end.  I will not be trying it.  For those interested, I took the blue path.  Hopefully for you the red path is better.  Or at the very least shorter."

A game does not have to be brilliantly written, beautifully textured, or flawlessly programmed to get me to recommend it. All it has to do is show me something I haven't seen before, give me an hour (or more) of a good time, or just be a little weird in one way or another.So let's talk a bit about why I'm not recommending Drizzlepath: Genie.I would heartily recommend Drizzlepath (the original). That game showed me something I've not seen before or since--an unintelligible South American woman rapping what I can only assume is the most pretentious poetry ever put to paper while you walk through a pretty environment in the Cry engine. It gave me about a solid hour of giggles. And it was plenty weird.But the sequel is merely a slog. It's an American girl scooped right out of your local community theater just plain reading pretentiously written lines about the most basic philosophy concepts you've never had to think about because they're that obvious. And it takes HOURS of walking through the same environment with almost no landmarks and nothing to do or see or think about or enjoy. The only nice thing is the auto-walk button because otherwise your middle finger would hate you for the rest of your life.So go play Drizzlepath or anything else instead of making yourself wish you had a sensory deprivation chamber for a little change of pace from the monotony of this game."

The narration was bad, the story was not captivating at all, and the landscape unimpressive at max settings. The only parts I thought actually looked fairly good were the caves.

Gameplay is overall relaxing, aside from some ""challenging jump sequences"".You can save and quit at any time. The vast game world provides alternative locations, away from the main path, to explore. There you will find additional, story related information. The story itself is dealing with the question, what is the Genie? At the beginning, it's up to you to decide which path (out of two) you choose. Without knowing the outcome of your decision. The chase is on.So if you are fine with just exploring and enjoying the beautiful word of Drizzlepath, it's a clear must have."

Make sure there is nothing interesting on the line between the two points. Now take a different coloured pen/pencil and slowly draw over the line from point A toward point B, as you do this recite various proverbs in a voice akin to reading a script at a school play.This is what playing Drizzlepath: Genie is like.I thought the previous Drizzlepath was pretty bad, but this one's just as dull and is three times longer! I like the idea of walking simulators, but they have to have something in them to keep you interested, whether it be landmarks, buildings, animals, fauna, whatever. The extent of ""features"" in this game are a few empty houses dotted around, a handful of broken statues and an out-of-place dragon flapping through the skies: All of which you can't interact with.It's a shame the Soundtrack isn't available separately, it is literally the best thing about the game, the rest of it is as bland as you can imagine a game being.

The save feature doesn't seem to work very well and you can never be sure if you will be returned to the same point. The voice commentary is rediculious.. it's supposed to come across as profound in some way, but just sounds sort of corny. The Images that apper as story lines off and on are really very amaturish, crudly done artwork. The music is nice, but again, gets tedious because it takes too long to get anywhere. There is nothing to do except keep traveling down the ""drizzlepath"" till you get to the end where there is a sort of silly, amaturish story line with silly looking, innamate figures.  A dragon flying over me at one point cast a shadow and that was exciting for a moment until I realized it was no threat and wasn't going to try to attack me.  This is a very long, boring experience, the only thing saving it at all is the landscape, but that gets old fast as well. I stuck with the game to solve the two endings and was disappointed in it, but for a few dollars it's worth looking at."
,Not Recommended,438340,28964376,Posted: 2 January,all,theboywil,"I quite enjoyed the original Drizzlepath as it was beautiful and about the right length.  This one switched away from the Cryengine and as such is not as joyous to just look around.  It is way too long with very limited changes in scenery (other than either outside or in cave).But the big killer for me (and this is probably *Spoilers*) but at the beginning you make what appears to be a rudementary choice without any reason to choose one or the other.  (or maybe I missed what was supposed to inform that choice).  And then when you get to the end you are chastized for taking the ""long path because you thought it would be easy"" and then you get what I would consider the 'Lose' ending which is not satisfying at all.I did end up listening to podcasts while playing/pressing right or left on my controller but even then it was way way too long and I was so desparate for the end that to be told I had done it wrong was just a huge slap in the face.  And then the annoyance of ""Try the other path, it's shorter and more rewarding"" felt insulting."

I love games where you explore abandoned worlds, but I want to explore, and have interaction with the world.However, this game was not that.  This game was interminable (even the short path).  To make matters worse the voice acting was horrible.  The narrator speaks in a never-ending droning voice which made me want to walk off the nearest cliff and end it all.  At one point in speaking of a childhood friend, the narrator speaks of ""sweetly suffering his platitudes.""  If suffer she did, she decided thereafter to inflict those same platitudes on everyone else, or at least all the players of this game.  The game strikes me as being written by developpers who did not have the creativity or imagination to create a truly interactive world.  Or even a slowly evolving story that you discover for yourself.  Exploration adds nothing to the storyline, and the storyline is like a badly written scifi.Pros: really can't think of any big ones.  The scenery is pretty, but it's pretty monotonous aftter a while.  Graphics are okay, but not nice enough to make the journey worthwhile.Cons:bad voice actinguninteresting storyso-so graphicsno true exploration, or interaction with the world (there is an interaction key, don't be fooled you use it ONCE).Since the graphics, story and voice acting are all you get, they should be stunning, but they are not."

This for at least an hour. All narrated by a voice which -while not bad to hear- is extremely monotonous, making the poetry even worse than it is.The only way I ended to get to at least one of the two endings was through sheer determination to get at least one ending, and attempting to ignore all the poetry brought up.While the surroundings are indeed pretty to see, and the background music is pleasant, at the same time you could easily risk to get lost and walk back where you came due everything looking always the same.So, let's get to a vote:Plot: 4Without spoiling what happens, the plot 'twist' so-to-call, is worth of a C-category film. It would had gotten an even worse vote, weren't it for the fluff about the protagonist's village and people which was one of the few highlights of this game. Loses a point for having obvious gaping plot holes.Music: 7Pleasant background music. But nothing else to bring up about it: nothing memorable.Mechanics: 4Poorly implemented. If you're needing the button to interact with items for exactly ONE lever in the whole game, and needing the ability to jump in only two locations (over the course of an hour and half) , for a grand total of 10/11 jumps on a line to win, why implement it at all? It's not a challenge, it's not a puzzle, and it barely gives anything to work with.Gets bonus points for the ""auto-walk"" button, but also loses them for the whole two-endings to decide at the beginning and then having hours of walking by your own.Replayability: 4The two paths are different. Not by a whole lot. But I couldn't muster the will to go through that torture again. Especially if -like me- did the shortest path first.Graphics 6,5 : Actually not bad looking, but could be better. It's relaxing at least. I liked the fact you could see the mountains you needed to reach in the distance.Overall vote: 5,1.This game is not worth his price. I wouldn't really reccommend it. If you like to hear poetry and walk for hours without much else to do (if not try to find useless hidden messages around the place), caring more about the trip than a satisfying destination, then this game might be for you.Otherwise, steer clear."

Don't walk the Drizzlepath looking for challenging opponents or difficult puzzles. You won't find any of that here; in fact, there's only a couple of actual interactions with the environment in the whole game!What youwillfind are incredible vistas, intriguing landscapes, and bunches of weird little ""easter eggs"" hidden here and there, all accompanied by lovely and literate poetry revealing the inner thoughts and memories of the game's main character, Lula, a village girl tasked with finding a mysterious ""genie."" There are two pathways to explore, each with its own ending, but venturing off of the path will yield some surprising and even seemingly incongruous finds: hidden objects, and even people! It's a virtual sightseeing tour, through the eyes of a young poet.If you're in a hurry to get somewhere or to find answers, you may find the lengthy journey (five hours or so, if you walk the path at top speed and don't stop to smell the roses) a bit tedious. If, on the other hand, you like to see beautifully-rendered scenery and explore unusual and imaginative terrain at a relaxed pace--without anything jumping out to kill you--then Drizzlepath: Genie might just suit you."

I'd love to have come upon any of the interesting scenes shown in the previews and samples, but all I managed to do was to travel a great distance, maybe in circles, and listen to poetry snippets every so often that didn't mean a thing to me.If I was on the right trail, I couldn't tell. If I was lost, I couldn't tell. I saw no one, and eventually hit a section of the trail on a mountain that I could not follow. It was too steep. With nothing to show for more than an hour, I just don't care to walk the paths any more.

But I hope you're not trying to play this game for its narrative quality. If you played its predecessor, you know not to expect. You're expecting a gorgeous walking simulator with refined graphics and intuitive controls and logical design.Again, you will be disappointed.The graphics, even on maximum settings, appear so overcooked that you would be better off buying Morrowind (the original). Really you would, because not only does it have equivocable graphics; it has actual gameplay, intuitive controls, voice ACTING, an appreciable narrative, and Player Models (which were very impressively present in the first Drizzlepath, but in Genie, you are an immaterial set of eyes).It's a horrible game. I couldn't put myself through more than 40 minutes (and 20 of those minutes were me seeing if any of the controls made the menu cursor move at more than 2 fps).It's horrible.

And it's pretty enough to be nice to look at and screenshot.I got 5/6 hours out of it, completing both paths and the achievements were nicely done and 100%able within that time period.Unfortunately within a few minutes of the game I cringed at the singular voice of the protagonist. This innocent voice that is meant to be so articulate and emotive, sounds like a young girl reading poetry she doesn't really understand to the teacher in school.
