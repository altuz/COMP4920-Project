,Recommended,438350,21856623,"Posted: 15 March, 2016",all,Dj =D,"A great little puzzle game. There are 25 levels in total, which start off simple, but the difficulty begins to ramp up fairly quickly as you get going. The only criticisms I have is that there aren't really any error checking facilities right now (highlighting when you've put multiple numbers in the same net would help. Checking for errors was annoying on large puzzles) And a way to mark squares would really be nice as well, as in large puzzles it's difficult at times to remember which blank squares are linked to which others. Also bear in mind that there aren't any achievements or Steam Cloud support, so once you beat the game you won't really get anything to show you did, if you mind about that.There isn't really much else to say, it's a small game, but it has a price to match. If you like puzzle games at all, then this is a must buy for such a low price."

There are 25 levels of increasing difficulty with color-coded entwined dice you have to number correctly, thereby folding a lot of cubes mentally.ProsInteresting mechanics (entwined and split dice) make the spatial ability test a lot more challenging and engaging than it is in IQ testsInterface is minimalist, slick and out of your wayVery small price tagConsMissed opportunity for procedurally generated levelsMissed opportunity for achievements (I must admit I'd like to show off having solved all 25 levels...)A bit annoying to have to cycle through all numbers instead of typing them in or picking them from a listVerdictI can only recommend Dynetzzle if you are a puzzle game junkie, looking for a fix that is a tad original.However, I think Dynetzzle lacks too many features, even at its bargain price, for me to recommend it to the general population."

It’s not the most exciting of games and I found that I could only do a few levels at a time but I liked that it was a little different. There are 25 levels, which doesn’t sound like a lot but if you play it like I did, in short bursts, it surprisingly lasts a while.The levels increase in difficulty as you go along and for someone who isn’t the best at visualising it does get more challenging. The easier ones are essentially just counting to 7, but in the later levels the net is broken up and placed elsewhere, even sometimes rotated, so you really have to visualise the rotation and orientation of the net.For 80p it’s worth the money, It decent in quality and it’s a good casual puzzle game to throw on between games. If you like short little puzzle games I’d say it’s worth throwing in with the rest."

Ever since i was young i loved to play the game blokus or something like that this game gave me the nostalgia. I love how this game makes you create a 3D image in your head and it gets really addicting and so satisfying when you complete a level. Thats the most rewarding ding sound lmao. A very fun and creative puzzle game. Would love to see more levels if i even get that far though. :)
,Recommended,438350,21864036,"Posted: 15 March, 2016",all,SteveWinwood,Totally worth the 99 cents. It's been a while since one of these simplistic in theme and presentation puzzlers really gave my brain a work out. Even by the end of the first third it really starts ramping up quick.

I used my hands in an attempt to map out where the numbers would be on a dice, and I found it really fun that the game made me have to do that.  And hey, its only like a dollar."

,Recommended,438350,22639236,"Posted: 25 April, 2016",all,Pogo,"It's sort of like the logic of sudoku, but instead of playing on a square grid, you play on a collection of overlapping unfolded dice (and filling in digits 1-6 instead of 1-9).You can fill in the squares either by clicking repeatedly to cycle through digits or by typing the number on the keyboard.You rely less on process of elimination and more on the knowledge that opposing faces of a six-sided die always add up to 7. You may find yourself imagining the cubes in 3D space, or you might learn how the opposing faces are distributed across the various possible flattened nets.Technical suggestion: While it's great that you can type the digit you want when the cursor is hovering over the square, it would be nice if the player could navigate the board with WASD or arrow keys. I'm not bad at 10key, but trying to 10key left-handed while my right moves the mouse is quite awkward. I ended up playing the majority of the game by clicking.Colorblind folks might have a tougher time with this one. Because so many of the die nets overlap in so many places, they're marked with little color tags. Unfortunately, some of the more complicated levels have so many nets involved that some of the colors look a bit similar. In these cases, the similar colors are usually kept fairly far apart to avoid confusion, but some of the later-game twists also affect spatial relationships and you might find yourself double- or triple-checking to make sure you aren't connecting the wrong colors.It would also be nice to get some music added in. It wouldn't need much for how short it is. 1 or 2 ambient-sounding tracks would be really appropriate and welcome for this type of puzzle game. The existing background hum is better than nothing, but it gets a little unsettling and it's kind of ominous.I hope that additional levels are added as DLC, I'd love to play more of this.dice/10"

,Not Recommended,438350,24011375,"Posted: 2 July, 2016",all,Yiasmat,"Repetitive SimplicityCan you count to six?That is basically the question this game will answer. Now there is more to it as you have to imagine a dice pushed into a 2 dimensional shape that you have to redesign in your head each time, but that´s really not that hard as... well you know, a dice only has 6 sides and once you get the hang of it, the game offers nothing new.Nearly all level feel the same, as you do the same thing over and over. Sure, they introduce spaced out shapes which you have to put together before being able to reconstruct the dice in your head and that brings some fresh wind into the game, but it comes half way through and quickly loses it´s charm through repitition (again).The way the game is designed, it´s just far too easy. EVERY number has a counterpart, meaning you don´t have to think about anything. Just pick a number and start filling in the tiles. Repeat until you´re done...Instead of introducing moving shapes, more sided dices or blacked out tiles so not every number has a counterpart they just repeat the same concept for each level which for me was too little and only left me wishing for more."

My only real complaint is that the logic for a single die is easy, so the game developer made it harder by cutting up the pieces so you need to write down how the pieces connect, giving the game some artificial difficulty. With only a $1 price tag, this is a great experience for anyone who enjoys puzzles."
