,Recommended,438420,25612235,"Posted: 20 September, 2016",all,HappyZavulon,"A fun little game that has plenty of rough edges starting from a somewhat clunky combat system to a total lack of an options menu, but the story is interesting enough to make you push forward.The story and the characters are the main reasons for you to play this game. Some of the jokes actually made me laugh out loud which is a rare thing for games these days... actually scratch that, most of the jokes made me laugh or at least have a sensible chuckle. Humor is subjective of course, I personally know a few people who love Borderlands 2 and I can't stand most of it, so your mileage may vary.What I liked about the writing so far is that while it has a lot of gags and filled with easter eggs, there is an actual story happening and it's not half bad and I am curious to see what's going to happen. The only reason I stopped playing right now is because it's 4 AM, and even then it took some effort on my part to put the game down. I'd probably still be playing it if it didn't release so late but i guess that's irrelevant.If you are here looking for a complex RPG with complex mechanics and smooth combat, then look elsewhere, the game barely does enough to be considered an RPG combat/upgrades/loot wise. It's notbad, but I certainly wouldn't have kept playing the game if it wasn't a story focused experience.Your hits lack impact and it feels like you are just swinging through your enemies, which in term just wail on you while you are trying to take them down. The game lacks some sort of stunlock mechanic I feel, if the enemies got momentarily stunned after a hit or two it would have made the whole thing a lot more satisfying otherwise it's just a flailing competition where you just hope that the enemy runs out of HP first.Another issue is the lack of a proper options menu, you can't even change the sound options, that's just inexcusable.In closing I will say that I don't regret the purchase, I am having a lot of fun even with all of the issues mentioned above. The game is rough, some areas of it look unprofessional as hell, but at the same time it has some beautiful areas, good (in my opinion) writing, and it costs less than some fast food I bought the other day.EDIT: Finished the game, took me about 12-14 hours (don't mind the time played, Steam doesn't count offline mode time) and I will say that I think it was a good game. That said the gameplay is not good, if you didn't get interested in the story 1.9h - you may want to get a refund, the gameplay wont get much better."

Takes me back to my Xbox days when Fable, Sudeki and Azurik were a big thing. It would have certainly fit right in!It's a single-player game made for adults? Adults? Yes... adults. It's got quite a bit of language, sick/crude humor, probably things that a parent doesn't want their kinds to hear or get ideas from. I'm loving it. It is the like the Saints Row of rpg's, and luke Saints Row, it has its own personality. It's fun and interesting, it does a good job at keeping your interest.It's fun and will make you feel like a kid watching his/her favorite saturday morning cartoon.Things you might not like:*Made to play with an Xbox 360 controller, keyboard feels clunky*Lacks graphics & individual volume options*Doesn't do a very good job at explaining the game's mechanics. *Playable character is male only.*Items such as armor do not affect ir change apparence of character.*Mage class only (like Witcher 3).*Linear storyDespite all those things, this,game feels very much alive. The writing alone makes me feel like I'm playing an MMO because it uses current lingo we use today - most single player rpg's don't do this - or at least none that I could think of. It's a nice experience.TL/DR:A short SP rpg about a mage, loaded with sarcasm and adult humor. Very linear but it's easily worth the money and will make you laugh out loud."

That is the short version.Over all the game is good, it has action, adventure, lovable characters, good music, and humor. Lots of humor. It is playable and solid with plenty of challenge. The biggest problem is that there are several out dated toupes that, while they don't detract form the game, add nothing. The gameplay is good but needs a little more polish. I lookforward to the next game Infinigon makes.That humor though. If you are a fan of Dresden you will like this game."
76561197966963062,Not Recommended,438420,25648189,"Posted: 23 September, 2016",all,TheShakiri,Pros:-Excellent humour.Cons:-Gameplay is too linear. There is no choice in quest order as each quest literally flows into the next.-Clunky controls and mouse pointer issues. The mouse cursor is hidden and does not relate to its actual position on screen.-No tutorial to explain the control system or a pop-up help screen showing the controls.-Quirky graphic resolutions meant sometimes after entering main menu options screen the resolution changed to a small one but still windowed meaning you lost access to parts of the screen and could only be reset by restarting the game.-No in-game volume controls.-Music becomes boring and repetitive after a while. Does not change during movement or combat to emphasize the changed circumstances.-No voice acting. Voice acting would improve the delivery of the jokes.Overall:Would not recommend to buy in its current state BUT would recommend it if it was released as a free to play concept demo. May recommend if some of the above concerns are fixed.EDIT: Refund requested and approved.
,Recommended,438420,28524700,"Posted: 22 December, 2016",all,[LUE] TormakSaber,"Zenith is an irreverent take on the ARPG and fantasy genre with an interesting story that's unfortunately bogged down by the framework in which it lives. If you do play it, play it because the story is charming and witty, and mixes serious, silly, and sarcastic together in equal measure, while still telling a decently compelling tale. It's full of references to other games, and self-aware nods at the genre it settles in, and is pushed by a likeable cast with clear and relatable motivations.The game itself, unfortunately, is nothing to sneeze at. The art is decent enough to carry it, but nothing amazing or spectacular. There are afew sceens with decent vistas, but for the most part you're just going to be staring at an isometric view of the usual scenic ARPG vistas, and that's by design.The music is full of ups and downs. There's no volume control, so be sure to change the game's volume in Volume Mixer. It's way too loud. The music itself runs the gamut from jaunty tunes that match the lgihthearted theme of the game, to orchestral themes, to a few power metal themes for specific parts. The music sometimes feels out of place, and some of the tracks loop in awkward places that take you out of the game every time you catch the jarring loop end and begin. The good songs are pretty good, though, as are most of the main themes you hear throughout the game and in different remixes. There is no voice acting, so the songs and SFX are all you get here.  I don't consider the lack of voice acting a negative, though.The ARPG combat itself is passable. There's 3 elements, and 3 weapons, 3 projectiles, and 3 AoE spells, one for each element. Levelling up is boring, and skill point effects should have been multiplied by about 10. I can't get excited about 2% more damage a rank when you can only put 2 ranks in it. The only ones that do an appreciable thing are the combo extenders. Definitely a missed opportunity. combat itself is very ARPG typical mobile stick and run against primarily melee enemies that attack with combos. So it's a lot of stick and move, and melee, until later in the game when you become an unstoppable juggernaut, is a dicey prospect. The game showers you in healing potions, but they're on a cooldown, so you can't be too over extended. Loot is OK: Mostly bigger numbers, slanted towards one of the three elements. Basically nothing gives physical resist, and I'm almost convinced this is on purpose as a nod at the fact that you're a robe wearing wizard all game.  Spells are all decent, but fire magic is bottom tier by a great deal: Ice magic hits multiple times and slows enemies, and earth magic creates pushing shockwaves and stone walls that pierce foes. Fire is just single target shot, middling damage. Fists and swords felt like they were way more powerful than hammers, with no appreciable difference in range or AoE. I stuck with fists pretty much the entire game.Despite all this, I'd still recommend the game to people, if they're willing to look past its flaws. Nestled within a mostly passable ARPG with a lame overworld and ""random encounter"" map, no map system, and no quest log, is a genuinely interesting game with interesting world lore, and populated by a main cast of characters with motivations and aspirations that drive the story, rather than the story driving them. The ending leaves some questions unanswered, but they feel unimportant in the scope of the game - and this is made clear by the cast at the end as well, who also doesn't feel the need to ask the questions or seek answers for them. It's another nod to the genre.Would recommend, but be aware the game is a bit clunky and may not appeal. I went through because I love ARPGs and I enjoyed the story - you may not be willing to go through it. It's roughlya 10-12 hour game."
,Recommended,438420,25633472,"Posted: 22 September, 2016",all,GoldMaster,"I didn't quite know what to expect from Zenith. On the surface, it looks like a fairly typical fantasy ARPG with a humorous tone and decent production values. The price was right, so I bought it hoping for the best. It turned out to be a great investment, because Zenith is one of the funniest games I have ever played. From the very first few minutes to where I am now at about 5 hours in, I have been laughing nonstop and really enjoying the gameplay as well. If you like ARPGs, smartass humor, and over the top slapstick comedy, this is the game for you. After 99 less than satisfying hours in No Man's Sky, I needed a laugh, and Zenith keeps 'em coming."

There you go, my impression.  Seriously, this is a linear hack'n'slash game that appears to be made for no other reason than to be fun to play, and it is.  The game is quite funny; the humor is in the tone, the situations your character finds himself in, and the sarcastic and cynical personality of your character.  There is coarse language.  The humor does not rely on jokes, which would get old fast, this type of humor always feels fresh.  You play as a sorcerer and there's no physical customization.  There are simple skill trees, 3 of them, that allow you to become a caster or a melee character and to specialize in earth, water or fire damage.  The combat is not difficult, but does present you with challenging situations.  Being successful in combat is mainly about learnng the rythym of the mobs' attacks.  Mana regenerates in combat, health does, also, but really slowly. Potions are available.  For a linear game, there is decent exploration; there's no map so you have to look around a bit to find where you need to go.  Loot is decent and boosts your stats or gives you new attacks.  Every level you get two points to spend on the skill tree.  You can play with KB & mouse or controller, I recommed the controller.  The story is pretty decent, too.  If you're looking for a fun-to-play rpg-lite adventure, I would really recommend this to you."

Gameplay is also solid, art design is beautiful, music is surprisingly high quality and appropriate, the story/world has me interested, and the puzzles are fun. But the best thing about this game beyond all that is the comedy. If you've played any RPG since the dawn of video game RPGs you will laugh at the various jokes, parodies, and references; if you've never played an RPG before then you should still enjoy the game for its humor. If you played Final Fantasy 7 or X you absolutely need to play this game, without giving too much away...I had to actually stop playing after 2 hours to give my cheeks a break from laughing and smiling so much.What a delight so far. I'm excited to keep playing--the only thing I dread is that this game might end long before I'm ready for it to. But that might be more of my wanting this game and humor to go on forever.UPDATE: Finished the game. What a delightful ride. The combat wasn't always great but I'd give it a solid 7/10 throughout. Let's be honest--you aren't playing this game for the gameplay so much. You're here for the jokes. And on that front, this game delivers big time."

Graphically, the game delivers just enough to make the environment believeable. Framerate isn't smooth, but to be fair I think I may be having problems with my system. The major selling point is the dialog. The main character is a snarky jerk and gets punished a lot for it. The humor is funny and fitting for the genre. Think of a more up to date The Bard's Tale. (Unfortunately, there's no voice acting). I think my main complaints with the game are that it could have been a little longer and the character could have had a more complex level up system. Also there are some UI glitches and some issues with magic abilities on stairs and slopes. Other than that, I recommend this game. It looks like just another blah game in Steam's vast library, and I've played plenty of those, but it is a decent game that made me laugh."

It's a great laugh, it's self-aware & self-referential, but the controls are bad, the menus horrendous, fight mechanics are sub par. I guess the story & humor make up for almost everything, but this game could've been so great if the technical side had risen to the same level as the writing.Awesome, but to be taken with a grain of salt."

I am not that far; only 1.3 hours in at the time of review... but so far i have had some really good laughs; found a few ""secrets"" that were hillarious and well just had fun... actual ""fun"". I would say if you like games with easter eggs that are comedic, this is an entire basket. I am enjoying it and it is well worth the price! Now don't go in expecting super polished combat, or crazy good graphics... or voice acting. BUT do go in expecting whitty jokes and great in-jokes that really riff on popular culture.I do wish they had some VO in game; even if was the guy that did the trailer; however i know from experience that can become really expensive. So be ready to read a lot; but what your going to be reading is going to be great and funny... if not a new york time winning novel.I would not suggest this to the ""action packed"" rpg gamer; or the ""man i wish i had a great story"" gamer, but for me it hits on note; the moment i ran into the Final Fantasy adventures i almost lost it laughing!

Did that make sense to you?At start it might seem not too great with its graphics, but with all the angles and environment its pretty nice.Another point would be the fluent combat system, but it also comes back to the old habit of the potholic play where you depend on surviving till the cooldown of the health potion is gone.The Characters sliding between typical fable story moods, and realistic logical decisions is quite refreshing.Only main aspect i'd like to see for future players would be an option to decrease the music volume.If you're looking for a game where you can make decisions that bring different outcomes, then youre gonna be dissappointed, but will still be able to enjoy a game that brings a fresh breeze between all the symmetrical games nowadays."

(who generally don't play ARPG's)The humour is very far from in your face which is what it is, I'm sure I've missed a bunch of jokes due to not seing them, like one of the trailers that has someone stepping off a cliff while saying ""full of pop culture references noone will get"" - I did get that ""Shiny metal kid"" reference in the trailer but I'm sure I've missed a bunch along the way. (as it's not really a genre I've played)The game's still good enough for me to play more of though, a very early judgement but I do wonder how the HC ARPG players would like it though, so far it seems fairly easy...trying Icewind Dale 2 a second run through (and even occassionally in the first - getting surrounded by spiders/bugs - certainly posted a whole lot more of a challenge than this...*so far*)Seems stable - restarted it 4-5 times, it's a Unity game so if you're recording the sound's way too high and you can't change it - not a hickup from all of those, seemed to run just fine.Looks good enough for the genre and the music's really nice.Negatives I have so far:How to bind potions to the controllers D-pad is not apparent. (and no help is shown either)Some things you ""loot"" still show the yellow outline around them if they're in reality triggers. (there was a table you should ""loot"" to trigger the contiuation of the game and after it had triggered it still had the yellow outline)Purple and grey'ish text that's a part of the 3D visual right before you're about to enter the temple are a bit annoying due to the purple text becoming a bit smeared and hard to read, the grey'ish being a bit hard to read as the camera pans around and you're looking at a similarily coloured background. (it being part of the 3D visuals meas it becomes smaller as the camera moves away from the players it hovers over)Some text (happened twice for me) gets cut very short due to something being triggered in the world.Some corpses respawn very fast and at one incident I was stuck with text on the screen when enemies appeared and I had to smash the A-button 3-4 times to get out of it which meant they reached me. (the difficulty level still made that fine but....)So as you can see my complaints so far are extremely far from game breaking and should in no way shape of form have you avoid the game...What I could see as a potential put-off for lovers of the genre, you pro-Diablo'ers and such is that it's quite easy so far."

Companies feel they must force you to look at their logos so that you'll remember them(?). Linear paths and story telling.Only 8 cardinal directions to walk, shoot, fight.

Other than that this game is 10/10.Looking forward to getting to the Zenith in the sequel. Yes it does leave it open for that...watch this space.

If you take Final Fantasy games, and Baldurs Gate Dark Alliance and mix them all together into a slapstick comedy you get Zenith. There needs to be more games like this. I am curious about what Infinigon will come up with next. This game makes fun of all the popular role playing games out there and spins it into a great story. From mocking final fantasy characters to an elder scrolls reference this game does it all. although controls on PC are a bit iffy the story and comedy totally make up for it.I give this game an 9/10. would be a 10 if combat controls were easier."

Some of it is easy to understand, while some jokes requires background or better translation. English translation may be not giving the best feeling, but I think it will be changed in future updates.The first scene with singing human-eating spiders was great! If the game is filled with such humor to the end, its totally worth its price.Graphics is nice, gameplay is fast, character is fun to play and for now I want to explore this world. Looks promising.Will update my review later after more gameplay hours, but I think it will only change to the best.Totally recommend this game!"

76561198142841380,Not Recommended,438420,32754872,Posted: 24 June,all,StillLoveSpock,"This is literally the worst game I've ever played.The graphics are horrific and the characters will start clipping through the ground while literally nobody is moving in dialogue scenes. Scenes which, by the way, are so long and pointless that I just stopped reading it. The humor reminds me of that obnoxious kid in class that took all his humor from ♥♥♥♥♥. They would point out something that had the potential to be humorous but fail to actually... make the joke. I have no idea how people are complimenting the humor.And the gameplay is a review of its own. It was impossible to aim and all combat was just recycling the same combat because it was ALL THE SAME THING. Same strategy, same repeated mechanics that they introduced in the first scene, same basic gear.This game would be marked down solidly at ""incredibly mediocre"" if it weren't for A) the truly AWFUL story that tries to have a serious moment without earning any of my attention and B) the fact that PEOPLE KEEP GIVING IT GOOD REVIEWS! Now it has won the title of ""worst game I've ever played."""

However, if you're willing to put up with that, the writing is quite funny.  To be perfectly honest, that is basically one of the only reason that I would suggest this game; it's just funny enough to warrant a playthrough.  It's not that long, the story is all right, and there are a plenty of nods to other bits of games and pop culture."

It has a nice JRPG retro flavour, with the ways the cameras are fixed in some areas, the barrel breaking and some characters, along with many cameos and references to pop culture.It has its share of issues, mainly the thunderous music in some areas, slightly clunky controls and combat (I played with mouse+keyboard adn it felt... disjointed) and a lack of configuration options (if that is a problem for you), but for me they where not game breaking issues.All in all, a good experience in which the story, characters and humour make it worth it over a couple of minor problems."

It got a little annoying here and there with the lack of 'directions' as one thing could be stated, yet a prerequisite would be hidden in there... but I played this ARPG for the satire and whatnot--which I was fully rewared with. Couple that with an 'ok' story, and the game going on sale . . . I can't complain?Got my 10 hours of time out of it. Thanks."
