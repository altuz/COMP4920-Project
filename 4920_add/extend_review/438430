76561198015463559,Recommended,438430,23594572,"Posted: 16 June, 2016",all,Fatty Fat Chops,"10 hr EDIT:The AI are still dumb. constantly crash into you. swerve onto the racing line when exiting the pits. They are programmed to keep their line. If you happen to be in the way then they hit you causing you to go wide or lose time.Online play is garbage. get a 'please wait' screen then after 2 to 3 mins it timeouts. managed to maybe race 2 races out of the 30 lobbies I joind.Braking is bad but I think you have to 'level up' by going thri the VR46 academy to improve braking._____________________________________________________________________________I have many hrs experience on MotoGP15.So far on 'VR the game' I have only played a MotoGP full race weekend in Assen as Valentino Rossi on the hardest settingFirst impressions and improvements over Moto GP 15:- cornering feels more realistic, you need to have all your speed removed before the turn and accelerating out of the corner feels better.- less rear wheel sliding around from side to side. As your rear tyre wears (presuming you enable tyre wear setting) it spins more and is harder to find traction but doesnt slide around from side to sidelike in motogp 15- turning into corners feels way better than in motogp15. its sharper and feels more realistic.- Audio has improved and changing down thru the gears sounds better- Graphics are better. The rider moves around the bike more realistically. Crowds are better and cheer at certain parts of the circuit.Dislikes so far:- Braking feels weak and soft and I cant brake late to overpass someone in the corner. Braking late just means running off the track. Have done all overtakes in high speed sections of the track (have tried the 2 different brake pad choices)- Background music during races was the first thing I disabled.Will play more and update the review."

If this is your first Milestone game you will be mildly happy to start with, but next year you will be disappointed that the game has hardly evolved from when you last played it on the old title. Ironic for a developer that goes by the name of milestone. I suggest they rename to ""Little Bits""===/TLDR===I played Motogp14/15, Ride and now this. Not because I love these games, but because all the good racers play the latest thing.... Search for gallimar13 on the time sheets and world leader boards and youll see my name up top 20 most of the time.  Now you know about me and my level of play, lets talk about the game. I play multiplyer because I can clear the ""Artifical Intelligence"" by 10 seconds in 3 laps on the hardest settings. TT and multiplayer is the ONLY source of enjoyment after 20 hours.Firstly, wow, in 2016 they finally managed to fix the Time Recordings. Until 2016, recording a lap time and saving it on a leader board was a struggle for the developer in all the previous gamesA bug which has existed for many years in all previous games has been copied and pasted into this one. When you go to the Pits before you complete the first lap in Qualifying; the game still fails to allow you to register lap times for the rest of the sessionThe bikes are better, they handle better, very much the same as 2015, but just a little less jumpy and jerkyThe bleachers/curbs arent as slippery as Ice, you can actually use them nowGrass is still to much like the asphalt in a straight line and can be used as part of the trackYou might be thinking the Physics are amazing but the brakes are rubbish at the start of the game, this is because your rider is lvl1. Get to lvl100 and it all starts to feel like 2015 again with slight improvements here and there. Still Arcade like but some parts of the handeling feel a little more real like late brakingIn multiplayer, if you are a lvl1 rider vs a lvl100 rider you will have no chance, you brake later and corner slower and have less control and struggle more.Single player: As you progress through the game and your custom rider gets higher in lvl and gets good it doesnt get harder and harder. It gets easier and easier and thus more boring and less of a challenge as you get better as a player.You can not be official riders in multiplayer, you have to be custom riders. So you cant be Rossi, in the Rossi game.the choice of numbers and font styles for custom riders is terrible. Theres more rossi helmets to choose from than there is numbers and font style. Some combinations look terrible on the bike.The game feels like to much of a copy and paste of old games, with slight tweaks the developer should of patched in previous games. Your basically buying a patchFlat track is very fun, i didnt like the car modes.The old bikes and 2 strokes are fun, if you can find the right players to race them with youThe old tracks from ages ago have been added with the new tracks. This is very nice. Example: Assen is in twice, with the old layout and the new. The Donington track is there. And moreThe amount of custom gear to choose from is basically all the same from 2015, except you have to buy it. Theres obviously additional Rossi attire, from the likes of AGV and DaineseThe graphics are heavier on the system than in 2015, and dont look a massive deal better than 2015, but they are better, but just a touch.Sounds are the same on most bikes and have been that way for years by the same developer, this developer is the laziest I have ever known.Finally after every race it displays lap times, race times and fastest lapI can only recommend this game if your seeking to play the best multiplayers or love the pants of Rossi, as all online players have all flocked over to the new game because its only marginally slightly better and it is able to record a lap time properly in the leader boards. If your in for the single player, buy 2015 for cheap. Ride is terrible but good for a change of tracks. You could buy both for cheap and not bother buying Rossi.Multiplayer lobbies are still cranky, and behave strangely when someone with a bad connection joins. The code is not smart enough to be able to take a player with a bad connection and remove him, without crashing the game back to desktop first; taking everyone in the lobby out in the same way.Theres still no function to chat in a online lobby, its like this game was made in the stone age. You have to shut down the lobby and kick all those that joined to change the settings like the voting system, the game type or the tyre options. Thats terrible by any of the standards in 2016The menus are over done and overly confusing, and over animatedTheres not enough smart ways to save your custom bike settingsAlso when you win a race, the celebration has been removed and the PITS have been removed, the game has less immersion. There is no video cut scene when you win a world championship. There is no commentary like you get in football games. Its justa excel spreadsheet of the result then then option to start a new season. YAWN. 2015 had these things.Milestone as a developer does not support its games. Ive seen better support and more updates in Angry Birds and other mobile games/apps. Usually after release, if you have any issues, you live with them,If money or love is not an issue, I recommend this game over previous titles, but its not a great deal better eitherIf Milestone is the Developer, dont buy a season pass or any additional extras other than the base game. These guys dont add anything to the base games value afterward.Following the milestone franchise there is a lot to be desired. If this is your first Milestone game you will be mildly happy to start with, but next year you will be disappointed that the game has hardly evolved from when you last played it on the old title. Ironic for a developer that goes by the name of milestone. I suggest they rename to ""Little Bits"""

MotoGP is split into 2016 MotoGP, Moto2, Moto3, the 2015 season, 500cc Two-Strokes, 250cc Two-Strokes, 125cc Two-Strokes. Then there's Flat Track, either in single race, Americana or Enduranch styles. Drift, Rally and R1M Practice. And then we haven't even gotten to the Historic Events, Time Attacks (And a special Rossi Time Attack mode), and even Randomly Generated Challenges. Haven't even gotten to the DLC yet which adds even more.-Added Rider Bonuses and a levelling up system which I think some will not like, but I personally enjoy as it gives you some goals to work toward unlocking.-A lot more helmets to choose from! I love helmets.-Career mode is a lot more refreshing since they break up the actual season into portions where you do the other race categories (Flat Track, R1M, Drift ,Rally)-Contrary to popular belief, motorcycle portion physics is actually pretty good for a video game if you set it to Pro. You fall over just for the slightest physical infraction and takes a lot of skill to get used to.-♥♥♥♥ing Rossi voiceovers and interviews!Cons :-Graphics not bad, but pretty meh by 2016 standards especially with the standards set by Gran Turismo and Forza.-Audio is average, forgettable soundtrack. BG audio like crowds and exhaust back blasts are choppy and crackle sometimes under heavy load.-Rossipedia. 3D gallery, neat but useless function.-Driving physics in Rally and Drift are weird and illogical. Cars feel weightless. Takes getting used to.-No more bike and team customization! Not that I care, was never great anyway in previous MotoGPs.See video below for visual presentation :https://youtu.be/eqUrYNA5evk"

How many years has it been since they took over from THQ? How many years have they had to come up with a half decent multiplayer mode? How many years to iron out glitches and crashes? Yet every year it's the same, same old game, same old glitches and crappy(even when you can get into a lobby) multiplay. I love Motogp, and the sad thing is, this is the only liecensed sim out there.

I have mainly compared the VR game to MotoGP 15 wich was very disappointing. Anyway. The game is improved in almost every aspect. The Flat track and Monza Rally show are just a small add on to the game, and honestly for me they are waste of time. Only on bike/car to choose. To make it short:PROS:-Improved graphics and physics. Now riding a bike is more challening and gfx is more realistic.-The feeling of a speed is very good.-Improved sounds of some bikes.-Whole MotoGP 2016 season.CONS:-The grass still has the same grip for front tire :-(-There are some bugs that I've noted already but they are not annoying as in previous games-Some bike still have that annoying sounds-Not many possibilites to customise the rider. Only few boots and gloves to choose, many helmets but only from italian manufacturers.I didn't play the multiplayer yet."
,Recommended,438430,23603241,"Posted: 16 June, 2016",all,=MM=vSammx,With over 120 hrs on motogp 15 i can instantly tell the difference in the 2 games. this game has been improved in every way apart from one and thats the braking. the braking is useless and may aswell be using 2 blocks of wood to stop. this needs fixing ASAP. to me right now it needs improving in just that single way other than that its great
76561198022266545,Recommended,438430,23663700,"Posted: 19 June, 2016",all,Jacko®,"Jacko Rating8.5/10After 10 hours of play I can reccomend this game to Bikers and Motogp fans as I have had a blast playing so far.Lets get down to the specs;The graphics and visuals are great and the attention to details on the bikes is superbAudio a little dissapointing and seems to be exactely like Motogp 15 which i own, after playing many hours of Dirt Rally the audio here is definately below par.Animations are decent enough and I got a very rare FPS drop/hitch (I run a high end PC) which I hardely noticed, certainly nothing to distract me from the game.Actually playing the game is as I have already heard quite similar to Motogp 15 so it was easy to pick up and go straight in with no assists, pro physics and AI set to Hard.  I found it easier to win than previous Motogp games so not sure how thats gonna sit with fans of the franchise, I would have liked more of a challenge.The amount of content is fantastic with Career mode as it is in previous releases letting you build your own customized rider and bring him up from Moto 3 to Motogp, also included are Non bike races such as rally and drift but my favorite is the extra flat track bike races at the VR Ranch.For me being a biker, gamer and Valentino Rossi fan the games dedication and theme of VR throughout is an absolute must have and the extra content included is all related to VR's history and amazing career such as classic 125cc, 250cc and 500cc races (yes the old 2 strokes) plus flat track races on 2 different tracks along with other highlight events and races from VR's past.  A treat for VR fans!To sum up I am happy with the changes and VR wrapping that has been added this year to improve the Motogp franchise and will be playing many more hours prentending I am the man himself - RossiNice Effort this year."

Compared to the previous MotoGP games it seems alot more immersive and realistic, mainly due to the new features in the carrer mode such as Rally and Flat track races. The ""Valentino Rossi Game"" idea seems to work well, it adds alot more content to the game.The graphics are much improved and the bikes handling/feeling feels a lot better.Its a shame they scrapt the motorhome and pit settings for the career mode but the new idea of being apart of VR46 academy is very refreshing."
76561198006125695,Recommended,438430,23601998,"Posted: 16 June, 2016",all,PointBlank,"Loving the game so far.Looks stunning and plays really really nice super smooth""No Stutter""like when you turned into the apex in the previous titles.The physics have improved  under breaking and getting on the gas.Lots and Lots of content which is varied like off road bikes and rally track.Well worth the price Tag, can't comment on the DLC as not purchased yet.Couple of negatives : audio is ok but not  not great when you look behind or pan the camera the sound is directional (don't like it ).also onboard sounds need attention.No Rider Names doesn't Work ?I have turned off rider names in options but still shows up in game.The names are noticible when you come into range of another rider....I hate this.I don't want to see some digital name above a rider when im racing, it kills the immersion and looks arcade and loses the look and feel of a stunning game.If anyone knows a work around i'm all ears.UPDATE: Milestone have fixed name issues and is currently looking @ online disconection issues. so good news.Also they still haven't implemented online options where you can lock players assists such as forcing all to race onboard. So you will still will be disadvantaged if you like to play onboard (you will never be as fast as ppl playing in arcade mode behind there Bikes).Edit: 10 hrs game play so far. Multiplayer is Broken at the moment it's hit and miss...mainly miss, if you can actually race someone online it's awesome but very annoying and time wasting the  game crashes or please wait and nothing happens so be prepared for all that that crap.Still recommend it  as its awesome fun."

,Recommended,438430,32835185,Posted: 26 June,all,<(-_-)> Kirby,"Probably not worth the full price, but definitely worth picking up on sale if you're a MotoGP fan.I'm an amateur sim-racer with cars (FFB wheel, H-shifter, TrackIR) as well as an RL motorcycle rider and track day amateur. There has never been much interest in motorcycle racing games with my xbox controller.Cut to a few years ago when I first subbed to MotoGP. I began looking for mod tracks in all of my games (mostly available in AC) to preview the course on the upcoming MotoGP race. As you can imagine, it is quite difficult finding those tracks in a car game, with many of them being motorcycle only, or others using entirely different course layouts. So when VR46 was on sale, I grabbed it. I've only spent 4 hours in it at the time of this writing, I've only unlocked one achievement and havent really scratched the surface of the career. THAT SAID, every week, before a race I'll fire up VR46 and replay one of the Real Events DLC races or just a short race weekend on that track, usually even on Moto3 level. It has become part of my race weekend routine, and I'll recommend it to any MotoGP fan for that reason."

Career mode has changed and now you start in the VR46 acadamey as a wild card and have to fight your way to the GP. There are several other events throughout the season besides GP racing like Vale's flat track, drifting, rally races, and racing the R1's. Besides the career, there are so many other events from Vale's career that you can re live. Customer Support is active, they even fixed an obscure glitch that from what I found, only happened to me.

If you get the deluxe edition you have seasons and a RC track (like VRC Pro) but only 1 small track, seems like a experiment.  It seems a bit slower paced than MotoGP15, but has improvements to graphics and good physics.I got it on a steam sale for $12 for deluxe ($8 base game), so that is a good value. If you already have MotoGP15, MotoGP17 or Ride, most of the racing is very similar with a few fun ideas thrown in just to let you know. Will update after playing more."
