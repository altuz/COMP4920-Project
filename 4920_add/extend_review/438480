,Not Recommended,438480,24073228,"Posted: 4 July, 2016",all,midnightq2,"A disappointing tower defense game. There is no choice in creating paths, very few locations to build towers, and little variety among the towers available. Over the course of the game, you do not ""level up"" in any way. You do not unlock new towers or improve your towers. You simply play on new maps with the same towers. Lastly, the towers always seem to target the enemy closest to them, rather than the enemy furthest ahead, so they often do a little damage to several enemies without killing any of them. There is no way to adjust the towers' targeting behavior. Other than the soundtrack, there is very little that is distinctive or excellent about the game, and there are plenty of other games that do the same thing better."

Using objects like amplifiers and speakers you need to protect your heavy metal band from angry or rowdy fans, and enemies of your music. Simplistic game with straight forward base mechanics. Buildings level up 2 times. Currency is used for purchases and upgrades as per ususal.Nothing innovative or fresh here but a neat 100%. Rather easy but kind of consuming if the maps trip you up. Achieves and badges included. Its decent for what it is."

But... what an utter piece of s#!t.The execution is terrible. The towers (speakers) don't work well as intended, the range and power balance is nonexistent. The towers also seem to target only the things closest to them rather than the farthest ones. How can you play a TD game when the towers are broken?Seriously. I've been more than patient with this game because i want to atleast complete it and gather all the achievements. But it's just not worth it. This game makes me angry everytime i play it."

,Not Recommended,438480,33960455,Posted: 1 August,all,Bubbles,"Although I did play it for a fair amount of time, it got boring pretty quickly and it's very repetitive. With a few things changed it could have been far more enjoyable and that's kind of a shame, because I like that type of music and I like tower defense games.First of all, the soundtrack has 2 or 3 songs. In 40 levels, you can imagine how often I had to listen to each song. I personally know at least a dozen of small local Rock/Metal/Hardcore Bands that would have died for being featured in a videogame. For free, just to advertise! With a bit of effort each stage could have had a different song, which would have been awesome! The way it turned out to be in this game is the same damn songs just playing and playing, even in the menues. That totally destroys the immersion that you're ""defending"" a Metal Concert. Very annoying.Another problem is that there are only 8 different speakers (aka towers) and they are not balanced in any way. I have just been building one (!!!) sort of speakers in the last stage (which is just a giant, uninspired clusterf*ck anyway) and had to watch the 7328472389478239 enemys getting destroyed by it afterwards.After you've finished the game there is not even some kind of ""Congratulations - Victory"" title screen or anything. Seems like even the developer doesn't care if you'll finish this game.That all being said, the price, especially on sale, is fair. But I was hoping to find a game build with love and effort, no matter how small or unoptimized it would turn out to be, which isn't the case. This is kind of a missed opportunity as it just feels the dev didn't bother to put enough effort in it and finish this game properly.If there'll ever be a Rock'N'Roll Defense 2 and these mistakes get ironed out, book me in."

You do not unlock things, sadly. You can choose them all from the beginning. At the top left you can click on the speakers and choose which ones you want to have in the levels. Starting a wave early, even if the previous run hasnt completed it. Will earn you some Bonus gold. ""Early bonus gold"". There is also a rating on each level. You are able to get between 1-3 skulls.  The most downside that i have with this game. That you can't control your own towers. I Mean with that, That they don't have a priority and you can't choose one. They will ONLY attack the unit that is the CLOSEST to them.Selling towers will not give you 100% of your money back. This also counts turing ""Break phases"".NO UNLOCKABLE TOWERS.Lifebar is above the stage itself.Spacebar speeds the game up. Pressing it again will resume the speed back to normal.Some Instruction tips.Contains Metal music during game.Towers uncontrollable and only attack units that are the CLOSEST to them. Not on how far they have travelled.You can reset the entire stage.Towers feels weaks.Upgradable towers,  This could sometimes be hard to click, Reason unknown.You don't get alot of coins and you almost only rely on the early wave start bonus.Other things.You can complete the first level, only placing Midi towers and get 3 skulls.Game is incredible hard to beat 3 skulls on almost each level. Reason for this, The Towers feels weak and they only attacked the closest one that are near them.Qauntity seems better then Quality (Upgrade).In the Current state, Its somewhat fun, but it is mostly frustrating if you are aiming for 3 skulls. The idea is refreshing. Fact that you can't unlock towers is a downside too. I Got this with a deal, that was 50 cent. It was worth it for that price. But if you are aiming for 3 skulls only then i would recommend to wait a bit. The game only has Metal theme music so if you are only playing for fun and you are enjoying that kind of music. Then i would recommend the full price.furthermore, im looking to Gameplay based and not Theme based of games. (like metal or whatever) Themes will not decrease or increase ratings. I just see them as a bonus in the game. The game was okay, but frustrating on the same time, that is why i couldnt recommend it and only give it a 6/10.-------------------I Give this game a 6/10"

A little more of a challenge for a couple of maps to get the three skulls perfect/no damage taken score but can finish the 20 maps in around a couple of hours, if you are trying for perfect.Early access so currently no cards or achievements - could use a level editor and more stages / enemies.To the person saying that you can't upgrade your towers, each tower has three levels, you need to click on it and then the image above.The first time I played through, I didn't realise there were more than 10 maps - the 'choose your speakers' box was covering up the dotted line pointing to the next screen above.I got this on special and was a fun time waster for the price of 50 cents"

Normally, tower defense fans often see towers with guns, rockets and submachine guns but in here it's all about the music and the different kind of music speakers that you will put on the road to avoid losing is a very interesting way that sure feels refreshing to this genre.If you are into rock music you can also buy the soundtrack that will keep you pumped while defending the stage. You may not be into all of the soundtracks but there are few interesting ones.I finished all levels in around 6 hours with some levels that I had to restart because I lost or because I was trying to get 3 skulls (no damage to the stage) but to honest I didn't even notice that time whas flying by. If you like tower defense games with a decent strategy and you are looking for something with a different theme, this game might be just what you are looking for.Rock on!"

The premise seemed interesting.Some things stop me from recommending though;1. crashes.2. appearance of random lag, especially when restarting a level.3. the lag seems to effect tower damage output.4. towers need more balancing, seem underpowered/expensive.5. game has 10 music tracks but levels/concerts will loop one song over and over. you will even hear the same song repeated over multiple levels/concerts if you do a number of stages per sitting.If the developers improve the game in these respects then I will revisit my review."

It looks more like a draft, rather than a full game.Especially as there are so many tower defense games around.NB: there was some improvements since my previous comments, cards, achievements...But still it is a bit shallow."

You will protect your concerts, placing equipments along the way trying stopping whoever will try to ruin the party!!! Enjoyable or maybe not...PS: Everything u read in here is a personal statement, coming from my point of view and maybe not reflecting what the game itself looks like."

There are some minor gameplay tweaks that need to be done for example area of effect speakers affected area need to be bigger but perhaps do less damage to compensate for the increase in area. But other then that the dev has fixed a lot of the imbalance, and fixes bugs on a regular basis.One flaw that could be patched would be more song tracks. Hearing the same selection over and over again gets kind of tedious."
