There's so much to talk about...*Warning, this is very long, mate*~Mechanics~It's like all other Lego games in most ways; you go through the story of the movie the game is based on, destroy things and Lego studs pop out, you use them to buy characters and vehicles and upgrades (most commonly known as ""Red Bricks"").There are some things that set it apart a bit from other Lego games though.:Graphics:The game has really good graphics. The shadows and textures and water and all are really good. It runs smooth and all the places look like from the movie.:Missions:This game has missions (y'don't say). Missions for Scavengers, Resistance members, First Order members, Bounty Hunters, translator droids, and general missions for anyone. You have to be one of those folks, then accept the mission. They're fun to do, and once you've completed them all you can redo them.:Hub:The hub in this game is many smaller hubs. There's a pretty good sized hub on each planet, D'Qar, Takodana, Jakku, and Starkiller Base. There are missions to do and characters to buy in each planet-hub.On D'Qar is the Resistance base, it looks just like from the movie. The character creator and place to buy Red Bricks (upgrades) is on this planet.On Takodana there's Maz's Castle (or, the ruins of Maz's Castle...) and the lake and a few small islands.On Jakku there's Niima Outpost, the village the First Order attacked at the start of the movie, and a large area of desert with crashed Star Destroyers and X-Wings and Tie Fighters from battles both long ago and recent.On Starkiller Base there's, well... Starkiller Base xD There's control buildings, the big platform from wich General Hux gave his speech before firing the Starkiller, out in a stone area where you can't get to there's Tie Fighters lined up and ready, and there's the snowy forest in which the battle between Kylo Ren, Finn, and Rey took place.~Storyline~The storyline is just like in the movie, but with Lego humor added. The only thing I don't like is they make the First Order act rather silly... But it's Lego, so eh, that's what Lego does. You play through all the iconic events as Rey, Finn, Poe Dameron, Han Solo, Chewbacca, BB-8, General Leia Organa, etc...On buyable DLC levels you can attack the Resistance as Kylo Ren and Captain Phasma of the First Order (personally, my favorite levels). Kylo Ren and Captain Phasma are included in the game already though, the DLC I'm referring to just adds one or two levels from the First Orders POV.There's Steam achievements as well, something I always love. =D (I don't have them all yet, shhh...)~Characters~The game has the most characters to play as of any Lego game I've ever played (and I have nearly all of them xD ). There are 293 playable characters (not sure if that includes my DLC ones) from every Star Wars movie; prequels, trilogy, sequels, and The Clone Wars. There are many versions of some characters as well, with different outfits, weapons, and abilities as they acquire them in the movies storyline, e.g., you can play as Rey as she is when you first see her with just her salvaged quarterstaff and Jakku desert clothes, then there's a version of her after she receives the LPA NN-14 blaster from Han, and then a version when she gets the lightsaber. And all versions have different/edited outfits (some may be ripped/dirty), it's quite amazing.:Character Creator:The character creator in this game is probably the best one I've seen so far. Every time I get a Lego game I always run as soon as I can to check out the CC. It's a big thing for me, I like the creator to include many body pieces and weapons and things so I can make my own hero or create a character they didn't add to the game.TFA's character creator is great. It includes all body and weapon pieces in the core game (except capes ;^; and it doesn't include DLC pieces, sadly, even after you've bought the DLC), allowing for lots of customization.The custom minifigure characters all act the same, they act like Luke Skywalker I believe, not too bad. Can be a boy or girl custom character without looking really odd. I don't like itwhen the default ""acting"" for custom characters is silly. ( I wish you could choose who they acted like... *coughcough* *hinthint*In Lego Pirate of the Caribbean all custom minifigs acted like Elizabeth Swann... Really prissy and silly. And they sounded like Jack! That character creator was really bad... It had maybe 6 different pieces to choose from... But I'm not here to talk about that game.What are some other Lego game character creators like you say? That is a good question, for another time... ;)In TFA's creator you can also create a custom BB-8 or R2-D2 style droid (however, on the R2-D2 style droid the colors on the ""head"" piece are stuck as gold and blue, even if you change it it reverts back, a small annoying bug :/ ).In character creator conclusion, the only complaints I have with TFA's CC are:1. There are only six total ""human"" custom character slots. My sis and I play the game together so we each have only three custom character slots. I wish there were more ""human"" ones, the droids aren't as customizable or fun to create and play as.2. Only one character has a cape, a white one. It's color is unchangeable and no other custom character can have one.3. Only one character sounds like a girl when jumping/doing things (not that bad, just mean the majority of your custom characters have to be dudes).4. You can't choose the acting of the character. So if you want to make an alternate version of Kylo Ren, he acts like Luke instead of himself... You should be able to choose how they act. Seems like it wouldn't be too hard to implement...But other than those things, it's a great creator. (Can you tell character creators are one of my favorite parts of Lego games, haha xD ^^^ )~DLC~Seven (7) of the DLC packs add characters from previous Star Wars movies and new and upcoming movies (Rogue One, I believe).These packs are:The Empire Strikes Back Character PackDroid Character PackPrequel Trilogy Character PackThe Clone Wars Character PackThe Freemaker Adventures Character PackRebels Character PackJabba's Palace Character PackFour (4) of the DLC packs add new levels.These are:The Phantom Limb Level Pack- During the process of C-3P0 and a number of other droids trying to escape an acid planet, you learn the story behind how C-3P0 got his new red arm.Jakku: Poe's Quest for Survival- Poe Dameron is trying to escape Jakku, with the help of Naka Iit and Ohn Gos. This is after Finn leaves their stolen Tie Fighter wreckage, believing Poe to be dead.First Order Siege of Takodana Level Pack- You are Kylo Ren and a Stormtrooper of the First Order, storming the shores of Takodana and leading the assault on Maz's Castle.Escape from Starkiller Base Level Pack- After crash landing on the surface of Starkiller Base, a pair of Resistance pilots, Lieutenant Wendy Wright and C'ai Threnalli (along with a droid, R3-Z3), must escape the planet before it explodes.I bought the game November 29th 2016 and first played it December 1st 2016. I completed the game on February 7th 2017. It took me (and my sis playing with me sometimes, she co-op'd with me) about 87 hours of gameplay, with a bit of just running around the hub/levels and exploring.That's about all, I suppose. Get the game to explore it all. ;PI rate it 10/10. Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens is an awesome game, definitely my favorite so far. If you like Star Wars, The Force Awakens, Legos, and Lego games, why are you reading this? Go buy the game! =D"
76561198203337561,Recommended,438640,25391670,"Posted: 6 September, 2016",all,vroomvroom,"TL;DR: I enjoyed it and would recommend! I was a real fan of the actors coming back and voicing new lines, the space/air combat, and I found the length of the game to be satisfying (took me 33 hours to achieve 100% completion).“There has been an awakening in your wallet. Have you felt it?”Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens is my first venture into a Lego video game since Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars; I bring this up because I'll be covering some features that are new to me, but may not be new to the Lego video games. Before I go over the 'new' mechanics, I'd like to address a concern I had about the game and that some of you who are reading this may be having: the other Lego Star Wars games covered three or more episodes -or what existed of a TV show at the time- but this only covers a single film, so this one is probably on the short side compared to the others, right?Well, in my experience and opinion, I found there to be a very satisfying amount of content. The game contains ten chapters which each took me close to an hour to complete (I went for filling up the stud meter), then there is a prologue and epilogue level (probably about 20 minutes to finish these), plus there are six bonus missions that fill in some blanks that aren't addressed in Episode VII which took me around 40 minutes a piece, and there are side activities that you can complete on top of all that. So if you like collecting studs and maxing out your meter then this might be somewhat reflective of the playtime you may experience. If collecting isn't your thing, then you can probably rush through a chapter in about fifteen to twenty minutes, depending on the chapter, but I'm not entirely sure.I really appreciate the high quality of the game and I felt that corners weren't cut beyond not waiting to release it as a trilogy (such a small nick in my opinion). The graphics looked great to me, though I admittedly don't have much of an eye for graphics or art. The one thing that absolutely blew me away was the fact that they got nearly all the actors from the film to come back and voice new lines for the game, including Harrison Ford who they got to say, “Wookiee Cookies.” Although I am considerably older since I last played a Lego game, I did find the humor (both dark and otherwise) to be well in line with what I remembered and it did get a few audible laughs from me.Moving on to those 'new mechanics' I teased earlier. They added a cover system that only works during certain segments of the game (you go into cover mode because the game makes you as part of the level design, it's not a choice based thing) which I found to be alright, but nothing to type home about, but I guess the joke is on me, because I am typing about it! Space and Air combat (both done with starships) is present, some segments are on-the-rails, while others let you fly freely to your heart's content. I found those segments really well done and they ended up being a highlight of the game for me (I would sometimes go back and load up that segment of the chapter and just mess around shooting down fighters, rather than completing the objective and being forced along the story).Unlockable cheat codes return, so you can do things like make the voices squeaky or increase the rate at which you earn studs. Character creation and hidden unlockable characters from the other films, such as Darth Maul, also return.My three gripes/criticisms about the game are as follows: You cannot skip the introduction video which includes the companies involved with the production of the game, BB-8 is required for a whole lot of puzzles (moreso than any other character, so that got kind of annoying to me), and one of the extra missions (the one detailing how C-3PO got his red arm) is PlayStation 4 exclusive. That said, those complaints are minor and didn't hamper my overall enjoyment of the game.I heartily recommend this game, especially to Star Wars fans and/or fans of The Force Awakens."

If you're a big fan of the franchise and what J.J Abrams has done with the new movie then you will enjoy the silly side that Star Wars has to offer. The cut scenes are to die for, they provide that tiny speck of warm sunshine to light up your already dead, cold and broken heart.Bad at games? Great, this is the game for you!Good at games? Pfft...Skip the traditional way of gaming and get your Golden Retriever to play for you instead, while having the liberty of punching your friend across the face with a 90lb dumbbell and eating a medium rare burger.ALPHA AF.What seems to be the case now around is that the Lego Bros at TT Fusion made the second player ""Experience"" -lol- more appealing for your friend who gets stuck with the non-responsive-knock-off-brand controller covered in sticky Cheetos stains that now decorate the analog stick by making him/her participate in the game more often, that's great news!

Yes it can get a bit overwhelming in the beginning, but a bit of common sense tends to turn up the tides in your favor, the puzzles make sense after putting some thought into it, and there's really no way to mess up in this game.Now excuse me while I go teach my golden retriever to punch my friend across the face with a 10lb dumbbell.(Hey you got to start low reps right?)GAMEPLAY!Game play starts at ""4:04""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCtqdas9VQo&list=PLxND3sVTXmLy0OlONyqMZf61wxcbFwG4x&index=1"

When the reveal trailer came out I was skeptical at the game having voices, but after playing through it doesn't make much of a difference.ProsNostalgia. Any game that can make me feel like a kid again playing through the older LEGO Star Wars games is a winner for me.Graphics are ace. Never thought a LEGO game could look so nice.Gameplays fun & varied. Throughout each mission you have a platformer, cover shooter & sometimes vehicle warfare. You should never be bored during any mission.Funny. Througout the missions their are lots of funny little moments that will make you chuckle.SO MUCH CONTENT. When I finished the campaign mission through (Prologue - Chapter 10) I expected to be on 60ish%, however it was only 26% and that really made me happy.ConsOccasional crashes at early stage. Only in the first 2/3 missions I fond the game randomly crashing, but once I got passed those missions I never crashed again.Small bugs such as falling through the map at one point.DLCWhen I saw that this game had a season pass I though the developers whould have been cutting content from the main game and reselling it, but with the amount of content that was in the base game was more than enough to make me purchse the Season Pass.

And there are warts. If you hate Lego games, this won't suddenly turn you into a fan.The game's a port, and the game's a Lego game, which is to say, there are going to be crashes. Annoying crashes. More than one. However, in getting a 100% completion for this one, I never lost my save file, or had it corrupted, so for me, it was just a matter of an annoying pause (a long one, since like all Lego games, it takes forever to load) before I got back in and kept playing. Keeping all the video settings at default helped (it wants to be at 720p). IMO, if you have this on a console, you should probably play it on a console.If you want 100% completion, you do need to get the C3PO add on, which isn't in the season pass. With this said, I thought the extra missions (i.e. not from Episode VII or VI) were actually quite well-written and enjoyable. The voice acting is really good- not just the lines from the move, but extra stuff that went beyond the movie.This is a faithful representation of Force Awakens that Lego/SW fans will enjoy."

I loved every one of them and each game was unique in its way, but this latest installment was a let down. I completed it 100% with all achievements but it felt like a chore. It was bland and boring, story playthrough was fun only on prologue mission but later It was tedious. Season pass gives you nothing special, just few more missions and some character packs, not to mention how it doesn't include one dlc. The main reason why it was dull is because it forced same puzzles over and over, and almost every puzzle involved BB-8 which was very annoying. Story wise, it was lacking and falling behind its previous games.The second main part of lego games is collecting stuff and going for 100% completion.I always loved this part but in this installment I hated it. I only did it for achievement and nothing else. Missions were pretty straight forward. Collect ugly minikits, redbrick and coins. Sometimes it had bugs which had me to restart the mission to collect remaining stuff. But the planets were something I disliked the most. Races, scavenging and my most favourite pod racing or space battles. I don't know what went through developers heads when they made this. For an adult it required discipline and motivation to complete these boring tasks, but I question myself what would younger audience do.I have to admit that there were some good elements implemented in this game, like special moves and better graphics. Cut scenes were also nice and audio was done good. Also I liked the part where you can collect carbonite blocks and get iconic characters.Honestly I can't recommend this game, not even to a star wars fan. I'm also not sure why they decided to make a game based around 1 movie, at least they could have waited for other 2 films to make something similar to other trilogies. I'm not saying it's a bad idea, but with 1 movie you can hardly give something fun and fresh to the table. It has lots of characters but that still didn't make this game any more exciting. Even Jurassic park game was more fun with characters that don't have fancy blasters and lightsabers. I can only see people buying this game if you they are hardcore fans and collectors of lego games but overall I find previous games better option if you are interested in lego games.//sorry for bad english//"

There are a ton of glitches which have resulted in me having to repeat levels several times and on several ocassions.  Two notable examples are on the ship with the rathtars, bb8 ended up getting stuck in the ceiling after a cutscene, and on the level where you have to get the ""wookie cookies"", the part where bb8 is navigating a crate on a conveyor belt, the crate actually fell off the belt and i got stuck.  The constant quicktime events and ""minigames"" where every interaction with a panel is extremely annoying. Most notably, the one's where you have to rotate the left joystick in a circular pattern.

,Not Recommended,438640,33178813,Posted: 3 July,all,The Lizard Wizard,"I really wanted to like this game, but it's just disappointing. I have a number of problems with it:First, the problem with making a Lego game (which have always been full of content) out of a single movie is that you get tons of filler. There's a level that's literally about getting the Millennium Falcon ready to go to the Starkiller Base, just going around looking for missiles and wookie cookies. And let me tell you, it's not exactly an exciting one.Second, I know humor is subjective, but I really don't enjoy it in this one. It's this Tumblr/millennial humor I don't really get despite technically being a millennial myself. I think there's one joke that actually made me laugh in the entire game, but for the rest of it not even a smile. The jokes are bad and the voice acting feels akward.And talking about voice acting, this is my first Lego game with it instead of the mumbling and babbling, and now I get why most people don't like it. it's not only unfunny and akward, but it also kinda defeats the point of the game itself. Lego games are puzzle games for the most part, so it really bugs me how the characters feel the need to tell you constantly what it is you're supposed to do, even when it's painfully obvious, through the entire game. Yes, Rey, I know BB-8 can use that thing. Yes, Han Solo, I know that's a job for Chewbacca. And so on.And the last thing is that the game is pretty buggy, sometimes you destroy something that's supposed to drop pieces for you to build, but it doesn't. Other times some characters you need get stuck and you can't get them out. Sometimes the game freezes and you don't know if it crashed or if you just have to wait. Sometimes it does crash and leaves you looking at your desktop like an idiot. The game has checkpoints, but you still end up having to replay a lot of it because it barely works.It's not the worst game ever, and the gameplay itself is decent enough. But between the subjective problems I have with it and the fact that it could crash at any moment, playing this game wasn't an enjoyable experience. If you're doubting whether you should buy it or not, I wouldn't recommend it, specially at full price. If you really are determined to buying it, go ahead, I guess there's a somewhat good game hidden behind the bugs and the cringy humor."
,Recommended,438640,25410256,"Posted: 8 September, 2016",all,Grynn Grynning Ghosts,"One of the most important things to take into consideration when asking whether or not to purchase this game is to MAKE SURE you have a controller that is usable with your PC. This game is atrocious on the keyboard, and I had LOADS more fun after I figured out how to get my Xbox One controller hooked up to my PC. If you have any console controllers you think you can use with your PC, google them and see if you can. If you don't, I'd recommend buying either a WIRED (has to be wired so it plugs into PC) Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3, or PS4 controller.Lego Star Wars the Force Awakens is an amazing addition to the LEGO Game series. I might be a little biased because not only is Lego Star Wars: The Original Trilogy for the Gamecube the first LEGO game I ever played, it was the first video game I EVER played, so I have awesome memories of LEGO games. There hasn't been a LEGO Star Wars game since LEGO Star Wars 3: The Clone Wars in 2011, so this is a breath of fresh air for a LEGO and Star Wars fan. The game plays like a normal LEGO game, but adds so much to the game. More puzzles to solve with certain characters, you can build multiple things with LEGO bricks by inputting a directional input (left, right, up, down) to build separate things which you can destroy and build the other thing afterwards (if this was too confusing I'd google it, it's a nice feature). It also adds in gunfights which feels really fun and inclusive in the fight. Last thing I'd like to mention before I get into Pros and Cons is the amount of Hubs. There are 5 hubs in the game. I won't list them all, but 4 out of 5 of the hubs are really big! Bigger then you'd think them to be. It allows for more exploration and more playtime to get every Gold Brick and every Achievement!Alright, time for Pros and Cons:Pros:-Plays like any other LEGO game but improved-Follows the Force Awakens story really well while adding extra levels for more playability-Vast amount of amazing characters with more in optional DLC-Really complex Character Creation, letting you pick from any character in the game's look and weapons.-The graphics look awesome for a LEGO game. If you've played the older lego games, you'll know why this is a ProCons:-If you get stuck somewhere and dying won't fix it, you have to restart the level. I found this for myself in level 3 on Jakku where you drop the ladder. If Finn is hugging the wall where the ladder falls, he gets stuck and you have to restart the level. There are more examples to get stuck, but just know if dying won't fix you, you'll have to restart, which can be annoying if it happens multiple times-It plays reeeaaalllyyyyy bad on a keyboard. Use a console controller to your PC, if you have to spend some extra money to get a wire to hook up a controller or to buy a whole new wired controller, it's worth it in my opinion and makes the game so much funYou'll want to buy this game if: You like Puzzles, you like LEGO games, you like (or loved) Star Wars The Force Awakens (or anything Star Wars), you like fully completing games (250 Gold Bricks, wowee).I hope this review helped you in deciding to purchase this game, because I know I really looked at the reviews before my purchase, but I never regret it :)"

When this game was annouced, I was super excited because we haven't seen a Lego Star Wars game since Clone Wars. So, is it any good? Heck yes it is! The story follows the Force Awakens movie as you search for Luke Skywalker/the map piece. You get to play as iconic characters such as: Rey, Finn, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Kylo Ren, ect. If I'm not mistaken, I believe that there are over 200 characters to play as :) After you defeat the main campaign, the fun isn't over, there are more story missions and missions similar to the Bounty Hunter missions in Saga to do :) Now, the mechanics. This game's added a lot of new mechanics! There's a new blaster fight that uses a cover system, which is really fun. Space battles have been updated and they give you more moving space than the previous games, it also has a Battlefront II feel in that aspect :) There's a new thing called ""multi-builds"" where you can build different things out of the same pieces, the game even gives you a choice as to with one you want to use. There's also new droid panel things, like for protocol droids, you have to get the right pattern, BB-8 and astromech droids have this wheel puzzle. Overall, the game is fantastic and very fun!

One thing to remember, is that this game does not have any (It wouldn't let me bind anything) support for computer mouses, thats right its keyboard only, however you can hook up a controller and play that way.Something to note, do not be scared if performance is lower than usual on first level (the battle for endor), it seems that they ""amped up"" graphics for the first level. Most levels have great optimisation, but some of the flying levels see frame drops.There isn't much difficulty, and the hardest part of the game is figuring which collectibles your missing, or why some achievements are not activating. This game is the easiest of all the starwars games I have played. Some of the ""side missions"" are tricky too, especially the races (if you are using a keyboard like I was). The ""added"" side mission content is good, with a couple of small side-story missions on each ""hub world"" which each have lots of content, yet a lot of the missions are similar to others on other hub worlds.This game is made for people that watched the films, as much of the story is not explained, missions are stitched together with cutscences and ""intermission"" levels. Talking about cutscenes, they are well animated and funny will make you laugh at least once.There is not much new from other games. The terminals have been changed up, being mini-puzzles of their own (you can get a ""powerup"" to remove the puzzles later). The character customiser has been made easier to use.There is not much replaybility apart from getting 100% aswell as all steam achievements which I managed to achieve in ~55 hours of gameplay, with most of that being me replaying missions to get collectibles, and doing side missions on hub worlds.If your a fan of lego games, and starwars, you will enjoy this game."

I picked this and Lego Star Wars: The Clone Wars up because my kids would love it. I've finished the story and played to 80% completion and its a good game. Not a great game but a good game - and a funny take on the film. My kids love playing the splitscreen co-op with each other, love doing freeplay on completed levels so they can play as any unlocked character, and love just messing around in the more open environments.This is often an improvement over Lego Clone Wars. The levels have more going on in them. More flora and environmental details, voice acting allows for better jokes, explorable hub worlds. I was a little sad not to have the ground assaults from the Clone Wars game (both I and the kids enjoy those, the kids because those levels are less on rails and allow a range of vehicle fun), but they really wouldn't fit the game's story so I understand why they're not present.I have, essentially, only one complaint: the obnoxiously long, entirely unskippable opening credits. Nice to watch (sort of) the first time, but everytime after it's a hassle. And when I'm just trying to get the game started for the kids, to have to sit there for two minutes while the game fires up is a massive annoyance. Much prefer Lego Clone Wars opening, which gets you straight to the menu."

I had hoped that this first Lego title that I bought was going to be a very enjoyable experience, but it has been a mix of laughing my♥♥♥♥♥off, and banging my head on my desk in frustration. So to get to itBig issues.-You Can’t start the program while your controller is plugged into the USB port-UI is buggy beyond belief, good luck trying to adjust the keymap-Using a keyboard to play this is near impossible-Save settings I.E. Screen size and flight controls are never saved-Countless times you need to rotate the “left” stick on a controller and the game does not see that you are doing it. One event in particular took me 15 minutes of rotating the stick to get past the spot.-Many times the game will freeze up for no reason and it lasts up to 15 seconds.To me this game seems as if it would run like a champ on an Xbox One, or a Playstation, but who ever developed the game did not have ANY foresight for the port into a Windows, or even a Mac computer. I really do enjoy this game when it works, the humor it in is fantastic, but with this being a game that has been out for close to a year, and these issues are still present, I can not recommend this game for anyone. An undiscounted price of $40 is an absolute rip-off, and this game is at best $15 due to the massive issues I have experienced.I will try to stick it out, and if my experience change over time I will updated as needed."

However, I never got past the opening bit due to a fatal flaw they've apparently been building into the Lego games recently - Lego Batman 3 suffers this same flaw.  It is not possible to play this game properly single-player, at least in some cases.The game starts you out with a normal screen, and you can begin fighting, breaking things, and collecting studs right away.  However, your second character does not follow you any more, and as soon as you move too far from them, the game switches to split-screen, leaving your second character behind.  Actively adding a second player, and then dropping out, temporarily corrects this problem, for a handful of seconds, before the game split-screens again because your second character does not follow you.I have only seen this issue on newer Lego games, but it happens on several of them.  I don't understand why it's an issue when games even as recent as Lego Hobbit work just fine, but without them fixing the problem, this game is next to unplayable.  Refunded, and would love for the developers to fix every single game that suffers this issue.  Until then, absolutely not worth buying."

From the cover system to being able to build multiple items from one build pile, Traveller's tales are doing a fantastic job.  I have to give this one the thumbs up."

,Recommended,438640,28522348,"Posted: 21 December, 2016",all,Sweetz,"I haven't played a LEGO game in a while and was kind of itching to play one. The Force Awakens scratched that itch well enough.  The LEGO game formula is still enjoyable when experienced in moderation.Traveler's Tales added a few new twists since last LEGO game I played (cover shooting being one of them - had a laugh at that), but nothing that really drastically changes the gameplay versus the prior games.  That's ok, I still have fun with the very basic puzzle solving and button mashy combat in these games.One new element (to me at least) is side missions on hub worlds - but these are all pretty tedious.  They mostly boil down to time limited checkpoint races or performing short tasks recycled from the sort of tasks you perform in the story mode levels - both of which are exceptionally easy and repeated many times.  Repeating these tasks outside of the context of playing a level just feels like busy work to pad out the play time and I don't think the game needs it.  I got my money's worth from the story mode - though was compelled to do the side stuff anyway because of the obsessive completionist in me.On the bright side, I was pretty impressed by the graphics, even though they're only representing LEGO figures, they're quite detailed and look almost photorealistically believably as toys come to life at this point.  Also they got the entire principle cast of the movie to record new lines for this game, which is pretty amazing.I did experiencing some crashing, somewhere around a half dozen random crashes over the course of 30 hours of play - which is not too bad, but the game has one of the most obnoxiously long, unskippable (by any means) startup sequences I've ever seen, so that certainly didn't help lessen the annoyance of getting back into the game after a crash.  Obviously fixing the crashing would be best, but even if it was fixed, a skippable intro still the only major thing I'd wish was different about the game."

Weather your a fan of Star Wars or just the Lego games, there is something for everyone.I never really tried the Lego games until a few years ago when Lego Marvel Heroes came out.  It really took me by surprise how much depth there was to the game, and how it wasn't just for kids. 30+ hours later and 100% completion and I was willing to try anything else the Lego games could throw at me.  When The Force Awakens game was announced I was delighted as I am a big Star Wars fan.The game itself is a series of hub worlds with a few levels on each. You could probably get through the campaign in about 12- 16 hours, but if your going for 100% it's more around 30 hours.The levels are bright, wonderful and full of the usual Lego charm that leave you smiling from ear to ear. The source material is held in high regard, and there is lots of fan service. The levels are a good length, unlike the very short 5 minute episodes offered by DLC.I enjoyed every minute playing the game, seeing the 100+ characters and many vehicles they had to offer.The only downside to the game was that i encountered a number of bugs that forced me to replay some levels a few times. This probably added an hour or two to my total time with the game. They may have been patched now, as I played mainly during the week of launch.I can't really say the season pass is worth it as it only adds 3 short levels that are about 5 minutes each and a few extra characters.I recommend this game to anyone willing to give it a chance, Star Wars fans, Lego fans, young and old- give it a go, and may the force be with you!"

It's not nearly as challenging as the OT and PT LEGO series, but in the same way, it's also far less frustrating than the OT and PT LEGO series. I think that the movie (love it or hate it) translates fairly well into the LEGO playstyle and storytelling.One particular difference from previous LEGO titles is that, once certain side-quest events and certain intros into main story chapters in the free-roam areas are completed and their reward is given, they're no longer available to do again. There are only a few events like that, though. The vast majority of events and tasks can be repeated for a single high-value stud reward alternative."

Right off the bat I want to say I'm very happy with the original voice lines the actors from The Force Awakens did for this game. They didn't say anything amazing but the fact this lego game had its own dialog from the actors themselves was a huge point of pleasure playing this game. The game also looks amazing, scenery and characters look great, its still a lego game but it looks crisp.Now on to the negative part of the review.This is the first lego game I've played on the PC and I'm not sure how other games have worked but the keyboard controls for this game were difficult and awkward to use. I had to use a controller to play this game comfortably, not a big complaint though as I have a seperate controller, but for users without one it might be difficult.I am upset with the constant level breaking bugs. Critical items disapear as soon as you build them, if you fall off devices stop working the way they should, characters are randomly inside the roof or walls. I have to restart the level for all of these and it is very frustrating when you work hard to complete a level 100%. This game has had more bugs and problems than others I've played.The gameplay is fun, but I'm sorry to say it suffers from the lack of force powers. Previous star wars games were very fun with the use of the force and the creative ways the game incorporated it. It isn't the games fault so much as the movie has little force use at all, but even after acquiring force users and playing free play your force use is limited to shaking and breaking things, nothing more than that.The side missions can be fun, but for the most part its just running your head against a wall for a gold brick. The carbonite classic character feature is a waste of time. I have to collect the carbonites, then take them to the Alliance base to open them and unlock the character? Just give me the character token, don't make me open 30 something carbonite boxes in a row and take up 10 minutes of my time.Overall I ask myself what was I expecting? There are lego games that cover multiple movies that are filled with great game play but this movie just wasn't something that could have been made into a fun lego Star Wars game. It wasn't bad but it was a little boring and unremarkable.This combined with the large amount of bugs and other mentioned issues is why I am giving it a negative review. I will still continue to try to get 100% completion, with luck I won't reach my limit of level restarts before then."

Instead of spanning the entire saga, from the prequels to the classic trilogy, you play only the seventh installment in the series. Despite playing just the one movie, you play just as much as you did in the other Star Wars games. There are nineteen levels to play, each featuring both on foot and vehicle segments found in previous games, along with all new cover shooting segments. This makes each level much longer than the ones found in the other movies’ games.Lego Star Wars is very much the completionist’s game Like the other games, there’s collectibles. A red brick, ten minikits, and True Jedi (collecting enough money) are something to strive for in each level. Minikits unlock ships to use in the game and Red Bricks give you powerful upgrades. They also give you gold bricks, a measure of your path to 100% the game. Along with each level containing collectibles, the many hub worlds you play in have them too. There’s gold bricks and carbonite in each hub world, along with dozens of smaller missions catered towards each type of character to play. If all of this is overwhelming to people who usually don’t collect everything, it’s very easy to keep track of what you don’t have and it’s entirely optional.While the game is great, it comes with a few small gripes. They are mostly along the lines of things you don’t have to fix because they don’t really break anything, but it still breaks the immersion of the game. There are some camera tweaks needed, and some of the indicators don’t go away when you collect things, and a certain graphics glitch you most certainly have to look up to get around. But these small errors are only smudges in the huge scope this game has. This game is very deserving of a recommendation and its proof that Lego games only get better."

And I mean classic LEGO, not LEGO Avengers. While LEGO Avengers was a good game, it just seemed like a complete copy of the Marvel movies, and not a unique game like a LEGO game. LEGO TFA however has the humor and the great gameplay and puzzles of the old LEGO games, but still has many new elements.The game includes the full LEGO TFA story in LEGO form (10 missions), a prologue taking place at the end of Episode 6 (1 mission), and an epilogue on Luke's Island (1 mission), and new stories (which I'm pretty sure ARE canon) taking place inbetween Episode 6 and 7 (6 missions). There's also a few hub areas, a bunch of vehicles, and probably around 100 minifigs, not including DLC's. And while on the topic of characters, yes, they have voices now. But it's cool, because it gives a better way to tell the story, and also, they got the original actors from the movie to come to LEGO TFA and record new lines for the game, which is amazing, and makes the game seem waty better, since the people are talking about the puzzles, not just about what's happening in the story.The gameplay is the same as classic LEGO, except for a few new features. There are 2 new big features. One, multibuilds. It adds a whole new aspect for puzzles. You now have to build multiple things to get to a new area, instead of solving it just using one build. Or, you can choose what you want to build, giving more player freedom. The second is blaster battles and ship fight, which I love. They are fun, and give new types of puzzles, while still feeling like a LEGO game.So that's my thoughts right now on the game. Once I play more, I'll update this review with more details and stuff. Definitely recommend."

I had played some of Indiana Jones, levels of the old Star Wars games here and there, and about an hour of Batman. However, I had never really sat down and completed a Lego game from start to finish. The Lego games always came off, to me, as very childish and not particularly a game that I would find interest in. The Force Awakens though, has changed the way I see these games for the better.There are many words that could describe Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but at it’s core there is really only one simple word that comes to mind. That word is fun. In recent memory, there isn’t many games that are strictly just a short but immensely fun gaming experience. Of course, every game to some degree or even a majority of the time is about fun. But many games want to do more like show you their breath taking visuals, get you to learn their systems and be more skilled, or even just immerse you in an entirely new world with a gripping story. Then there is Lego Star Wars.In general, there wasn’t much that really impressed me in Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens. The aesthetic style was essentially the same as previous games, with most of the interactive pieces in a level being made of Legos and the land or backdrop being realistic textures from the given movie. The voice acting was decent and even the story was just a rushed version of the movie. What truly makes this game so fun is the mix of the comedy, the generic but enjoyable combat, and using different iconic characters to work together and solve the many puzzles.It is clearly a point in Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens to keep the came lighthearted and funny. Though much of it is humor more suited to children, like storm troopers in bathing suits, or bananas for guns, some parts did make me laugh. I enjoyed that the game didn’t take itself too seriously and that myself, as the player, shouldn’t either. This was also very apparent in the gameplay.The combat in Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens doesn’t necessarily take any skill, and the puzzles aren’t really much of a head scratcher, but once again, this aspect is also clearly suited, not only to children, but to cater to everyone. Generic ground combat with the characters isn’t very exciting. Essentially, you just hit punch or shoot and the storm trooper dies and you get the little Lego studs. Boss battles could sometimes change up the pace of ground combat and allow for a more engaging combat scene, and as fun as the boss fights were, they didn’t happen very often.The one part of combat that I did happen to like was the air combat. Flying at high speeds in the X-Wing while gathering pieces and taking down tie fighters was definitely the most enjoyable part of any combat. You also can’t really miss while in combat, so it does just feel like a fun ride at some points.Another major portion of the gameplay is traversing the levels and solving puzzles. I did play a few levels in co-op and It was fun having to go separate routes to help each other advance. If I was Rey, I might have to climb a wall and let my friend, the droid, up an elevator so he can use a terminal. The puzzles also added more to the idea of laid back fun. When given the option to build something there may be multiple things you can build. I always took the time to see what each creation did, sometimes revealing fun secrets. Usually though, each creation would help get you further along in your adventure.When all these aspects of Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens come together, it allows for an enjoyable experience that is impossible to get annoyed with, and is just some casual fun. However, if there is one thing that annoyed me, it was the multiple bugs I ran into. A couple bugs would freeze my characters in random places, forcing me to restart the game. Others would cause random glitches on obstacles, causing characters to repeatedly die. They weren’t all over the game, but were still prevalent enough to effect the experience of the game.My original thoughts on the Lego games weren’t completely changed after completing Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Obviously, the game is still built towards families playing together. However, I do see the appeal of the Lego games. They are a fun, laid back, and comedic game experiences that can be played by anyone, especially in a co-op setting."

Definitely worth a go, especially if you're looking for some childhood nostalgia of playing the games on PS2 / XBOX like I did.But there are some very annoying bugs in the game that need to be fixed but they are quite rare and if you're lucky than you will hopefully have an uninterrupted gameplay experience.May the force be with you...EA got nothing on Traveler's Tales."

I was worried at first of a lack of content due to the subject of one movie, but it really pulls through on that part, with many additional what-if/side missions that really keep things going.  The now open world is teeming with all sorts of secrets and side activities to do when you're done with all the beat-em-up collectathon goodness.The game has a gargantuan character roster, though most of them are a bunch of weirdos that no one has ever heard of, and are probably there to sell action figures, though there are plenty of secret unlockable classic Star Wars characters hidden in the overworld to discover.Character customization is great again, just like in Lego Star Wars 2 and 3 (not in complete saga, all the custom character faces look like mongoloids).  The giant roster of unknown characters really comes into play here, since most characters part sets can be used in customization, including weapons, from gaffi sticks right down to Kylo Rens super-edgy triple saber.  You can also customize the color palletes of two BB droids and the colors and heads of two R2 robits.  Unfortunately you cannot add back accessories like capes to your character.  Also the character creation system is incredibly buggy.  Some slots can get glitched seemingly indefinitely, with weird screwed up faces, accessories appearing when they shouldn't, etc.  Doesn't completely break the game, but some of my character slots are more limited in what I can do with them to make them look good.  Not a huge issue for me, I don't make too many characters, and there are ways to still make them look good.Overall the game is incredibly fun, and I'm currently working on getting all the secrets and collectibles and reliving my baby days of Lego Star Wars 2 on the Xbax."

I made it to the hub world. That's it. I then had to ""launch BB-8"" using some booster pad, and it was only then that I was informed that I needed multiple joysticks on my controller in order to continue.

Chock full of bugs: Quests fail to recognize completion, Millenium Falcon bug as documented in discussions already, CTD at various times. Additionally, TT Games has been completely silent in regards to any communication with people on the forums describing game breaking bugs.  This seems to be rushed to completion (so it could work off the tails of the movie coming out).Additionally, some changes in controls. In previous Lego games, Force users and grapplers could target their abilities to remove the finickiness of some levels. This has been removed in this game.I have currently two game breaking bugs that have made one of my favorite game franchises unplayable. There is a missing quest giver and one quest giver never determines that the quest is complete (in this case it is a fight quest triggered by the admiral to ""train"" the recruits. Defeating the recruits should trigger the completion dialog but it doesn't) This guarantees that I cannot complete the game and frankly, with the finickiness of the controls (it took 7 tries in Starkiller base to line up a force user to get to the first Minikit) and the multiple Crashes to Desktop (corrected by turning VSync on - which was found by another Steam user and not by any help from the developer), I cannot in good faith recommend this game to anyone."

I haven't even completed all of the story but I knew just from the first few levels that this is the ultimate Lego video game. The characters, weapons, vehicles, and scenery all look great. When I first started the game, I had a little trouble due to the way the controls were set up. Since I reconfigured the controls to better suit me, I've had no problems with this game, it's more fun and also more challanging then previous Lego games.When you don't understand something, there's almost always a little control panel you can hit that will give you a helpful hint making it easy to understand. The blaster battles, which I believe are a new thing with Lego games, are so fun and satisfying. You get to duck behind cover and pop-out to blast some enemies. This is also the first Lego Star Wars video game to have dialogue. It has lines from the movies throughout and also some unigue dialogue that wasn't seen in any of the Star Wars movies. Flying in an X-wing or the Millennium Falcon, shooting down TIE Fighters has never felt more gratifying then in this game.Overall, I would call this game the most satisfying Star Wars video game experience available to us today."

It becomes apparent that the game was rushed and I do not consider this finished.  When it looks finished I will change my recommendation.  Despite my negative review I still like the game, I  just don't love the game.  It's lego and I love the TT Lego games.  This one has a lot of great innovations and funny story content but I cannot recommend it because it's just not polished in my opinion.  I would be more than happy to recommend as a $15 game but not it's current $50 price tag plus DLC costs.Pros:-It's star wars and lego!-There is a better borderless windows mode which is great if you're running dual screen monitors.-The story line with the animations and typical TravelTales humor is all there.  I love how they keep to the story line while making fun of it too.-Character control and the ease of controller use is very well done for the ground based characters.-They updated the graphics on this game and it looks great on a 4k monitor at 4K resolution.Cons:-The startup commercial.  Sorry but I don't want to watcha lucas arts, disney, TT commercial for the first 3 minutes of a game that I purchased.  This is why people pirate your movies, because they don't have to watch the FBI warning and everything else mandatory.  I don't want to watch commercials for every game that I buy, I bought it, I like you guys, knock it off.  (Updated Edit:  Everytime I play this game it bugs me that I can't skip the start up nonsense.  The dev's look at it as 3 minutes of no big deal.  I look at it as it gets old after the 10th time.)-The windowed mode cuts out the bottom part of the screen but at least they made it borderless.-There's no settings for the volume on music, just off and on, no actual setting for different levels.  They have this function for the sound effects but not for the music.-Buggy!  There are missions that you can't finish with options turned on because for whatever reason it breaks the action sequences.  On top of missions not always being easy to win the game randomly crashes.-Extra content is not intuitive.  You can collect carbon frozen characters and thaw them to get bonus characters but the game doesn't really help you understand how or where.-In free play mode some of the extra canisters show up with arrows pointing to them and some just don't.-On the world map when you're trying to complete gold brick quests there's nothing intuitive about solving some of them.  Some will have markings on the maps (highlighted areas) letting you know where to go, some will leave a stud trail, and others have nothing at all.  Past Lego games had this for all extra bricks and mini games, this was clearly released in a rush and unfinished.-The controls for ships are craptastic and there is no way to change axis for controls (Not an issue like I thought, the setting for it just wasn't where I thought it would be but it shows up in options during game play)Overall I'll still play the game because I love star wars lego games, I just cannot recommend it to other people to play until they make it less like a beta game."

I enjoyed to play the game with my littlebrother, and he enjoyed to play it with me.Today we decided to go back to the game, and hopefully one of the bugs would be gone.The first thing i noticed was, that when you look at the levels under the map, you cannot see at ANY point how much you've completed in the level... So you have to guess...Also i was unable to change to direction to go control on PC.If LEGO would stop messing up their game this hard, i would be so happy :)Please change it back, cus i feel like I've wasted money"

None of this can be skipped. When the games crashes ( which is thankfully not too often; once an hour ) you sit through the whole thing again but cannot skip any of it.Next problem, save points. Each ""scene"" is around thirty minutes long. That means when the games crashes at the twenty-ninth minute, you have to grind through it again. All the time you are wondering if it will crash just before the end yet again.Finally, random key remaps. The game will eventually only respond to the numpad Enter key when you want the menu (The Return key stops responding) and to add to the misery, you can no longer select any of the options in the menu. Most importantly, the Quit option.My son reported he could not stop playing because it would not let him. After a lecture about computers do our bidding not the other way around, I checked the issue with the bugged menu. Until this is fixed, SW.TFA has been removed from family settings.I suppose we should all be suspicious of a company which takes such a clearly unhealthy attitude to children.

It depends on how much you like these newer lego games and The Force Awakens. This is not like the original Lego Star Wars. It is still fun to play. Most of the characters are random extras in the movie who have or dont have names. Stormtrooper Specialist and combat engineer? These are made up just so the character count reaches 200.You can play as about 40 characters from the other movies like Count Dooku, Sith Chancellor Palpatine, Yoda, Boba Fett, Quigon. TFA Luke and Snoke are not playable characters. Every vehicle and starship comes with a mini version to use on land. Every vehicle, even giant ones.This game does have annoying things in it that newer lego games have. Scanning for an object to appear, tapping keys to do an action, stupid mini games, those dumb grapple hook things. I remember when I could press 1 button to do something. New lego games like this continue to use unneccesary and time wasting abilities. I dont care if there is a power brick that makes abilities instant, remove the abilities. Shootouts is a new feature where you hide behind barriers and shoot enemies. Its not bad, but sometimes I just want to fight. Fighting is awkward with a blaster because if you get close enough you leap at the enemy and switch to punching/melee.Other levels unlocked with gold bricks (theyre almost not useless) include random events before the movie. Saving Ackbar, Rathtar hunting, a pirate level with some interesting characters, stuff like that. Pirate captain Ithano is definitely one of the cool things to come from Disneys Star Wars. Recent lego games save the worst for last, and this is no exception. 250 Gold bricks unlocks a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥level where you shoot at balls in space. You fly Starkiller base and blow up planets. Its not as fun as it sounds. Seriously, we work for these gold bricks, I want something cool or fun after collecting all two hundred and fifty.Still, the characters are very well done. The prices for characters does not go below 50,000 studs. Its ok though because on the Falcon is the Dejarik holochess wave level. You fight enemies in waves, and you can get about 500,000 in 1 game with no power bricks.JESUS CHRIST THE VOICE ACTORS. Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Daisy Ridley, Anthony Daniels, Andrew(?) Driver, John Boyega, Gwendoline Christie (phasma), Dohmnall Gleeson (Hux), Max von Sydow (Lor San Tekka). They all have dialogue for this game. HARRISON FORD HAS DIALOGUE IN A LEGO GAME. How cool is that. I wonder how much they paid everyone.Im giving future Lego games bad reviews if we dont get a decent reward for those gold bricks."

Even though the basic concept is the same, each one is great for the same yet different reasons. I have played them over and over on various consoles as well as PC. I have no reservations about whole-heartedly recommending any Lego game to anyone.My only complaint is that they are using voice overs. Batman 2 I think was the first one to use voices, and it just threw me out of the game. To this day I don't know if it's because Lego games never had actual speaking characters, or because it was jarring to hear the Joker NOT be voiced by Mark Hamill. Then, they made it one step worse - they started using actual movie clips for the characters. Lord of the Rings is such an example. Sure, it's cool to use actual voices from the movie, but it's just so out of place for a Lego game. Imagine my disappointment when I found The Force Awakens was not only using clips from the film, but entire cutscenes! Word for word, the scene of Kylo interrogating Rey, nicely done in Lego but unskippable, and unpausable. I had to get up for something, but there was no way to pause or skip it, it just kept droning on and on... I finally had to kill the entire game to get it to stop.Bring back Lego games.

Like cover based shooting segements, several hub worlds, space battles, etc...If u loved the original lego star wars games, you'lle love this."

I really like the addition of the hidden Carbonite Bricks, which unlock a classic character.My only complaint is that character parts from the DLC packs aren't available in the character creator, so I can't put Jar Jar's head on Slave Leia's body.Don't judge me."
76561198304670419,Recommended,438640,31760217,Posted: 14 May,all,WhiteRose,Okay so this game I kinda like it the graphics has improved a lot and they look more realistic each character in game has the right actor who played them. I do have a few problems with this game. 1st thing is the controls now with lego games you thought you can use the keyboard and mouse? nope its just keyboard but if your a keyboard type player like me it won't really affect you that much. 2. The game freezes. So yeah most people are complaning on how the game freezes a lot but if you don't update your graphics card the game will freeze a lot. But yeah thats pretty much it this game is fun for star wars fans and lego game friends its not a 10/10 perfect game I would give it at least a 7 out of 10.

76561198197891265,Recommended,438640,31939350,Posted: 24 May,all,frognvw,"Lego + Star Wars, does it get any better than that?Very fun, a bit difficult at times. The blaster battles are interesting, though sometimes buggy. The vehicle races/battles are sometimes hard. The graphics are good. The audio however, is poorly mixed. The speech in cut scenes is quieter than the explosions/vehicle sounds etc. The ambient speech (various characters in the open world) is very quiet. The music is louder than everything else, making it hard to hear the characters.There's lots of dlc available, however the missions are quite short. It's best to get the deluxe edition on sale, as it includes much of the dlc (though not all). DLC is over priced for how little you get.Overall a fun game, plenty of characters to use. Lots of side quests/missions to play after the main story is complete. Many of the levels require multiple play throughs to get 100%."

,Recommended,438640,32391267,Posted: 13 June,all,korpuskat,"Very simple and yet highly entertaining. Great for perfectionists- a good balance of difficulty in finding the collectibles. I wasn't expecting to enjoy the sense of humor, but somehow Kylo Ren smashing a giant snow ball on Finn's face [DLC] made me laugh. If you've liked other Lego games, you'd like this one.The only drawback I had was the long wait to load into the main menu (there's two or three Dev animation card things at the beginning that are unskippable and very long)-- and the long wait for loading levels. Thankfully once an area is loaded it's pretty smooth. There were a few times I had quests get glitched (one on Starkiller didn't load the droids i was meant to fight)-- but simply reloading the area has fixed all major problems I've encountered."

The Force Awakens is yet another movie liscensed lego game, but it really did surpass my expectation, and surprised everyone who enjoyed it. Many people believe that improving the graphics and visuals of lego games are not possible, because they would still look the same in terms of their blocky visuals. TT Games and TT Fusion have once again surprised us all and have delivered a much needed update to their usual lego formula complete with brand new mechanics, gears of war-esque cover based shooting (in SOME sections of the campaign,) and absolutely gorgeous visuals, especially for a lego game. I will never grow tired of the unique style of which these games are created in by seamlesly mixing realistic textures and visuals with the blocky style of lego. Out of all the games I have played and that I own I can honestly say that the Lego genre is one of my absolute favorites. The music, the exploration, the comedy, the creativity, the easter eggs, the endless number of side-quests, both short, and long, easy, and somewhat challenging. In terms of all those traits, factors, and wanting to achieve full relaxation after a hard day at school, or work. The Lego games are the titles for players that search for that. I am a casual player that looks for great gameplay, great optimization, great soundtracks, and to become fully imerssed within the worlds, and universes of my favorite film franchises. Despite each of their titles having the name of one specific film, they always include levels, quests, and campaigns from each film in the respective franchise or saga. Even though it says ""The Force Awakens"" do not expect content from the clone wars, rebels, the freemaker adventures, and the ot to be left out. I always become fully involved in these worlds due to how lively they are and how extremely interactive everything is. With the combined visual styles of realistic textures, the great story telling, immense creativity, humor, easter eggs, iconic sounds, iconic images, beloved sountrack, massive amount of content, and the large amount of interactivity with the environments, and people alike I always become so imerssed that I forget I am playing a lego game. For any casual gamers, Star Wars fans, and people just looking for hours of fun, and relaxation this is a must buy, as well as the other titles if you love the other franchises as well. Lego Avengers can be left out, to be honest. Lego Tfa is my favorite lego game and my second favorite star wars game that I own, next to battlefront 2, and I very much hope that TT will continue to make these titles for each upcoming star wars, marvel, dc, and other franchise films in the future, especially rogue one, and the last jedi. Scarif would be incredible to explore as well as playing with Luke, and training as rey. This is a review for lego tfa and the lego genre in general. There are so many titles that I might as well just right an overall review on one page. :) The clone wars, rebels, freemaker adventures, and some ot content is available through the season pass, but you should not pass up the chance to purchase it when it goes on sale."
