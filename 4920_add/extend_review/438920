Done. Afterwards I couldn't buy it until I verified my account, for which they sent an email.No email received, nothing in junk. After which I was told I should try a different email account.I would like to make 1 thing very clear to the makers:If your game cannot send emails to a hotmail account, that is your problem. You want your game to be bought? Fix it.Because of this very simple reason I would not recommend it."
,Recommended,438920,24363207,"Posted: 16 July, 2016",all,Les,"it's more like simplified strategic game in fantasy setting.You are hiring heroes, getting gold, countering more land (to increase army size), upgrade land and try to eliminate enemy. On top of that there is card system, where cards can affect gameplay in interesting ways.Player can control 4 heroes that have one action per turn. There are 3 factions with variety of units, but I don't find many differences between units or factions themselves.Battles are played automatically (ranged, then melee) and can be played over a couple of turns (that's quite interesting feature actually!). Same goes for sieges (couple of turns),Overall I like this design - looks simple, but offers many options and tactics. If Age of Fear ever gets strategic view it will be something similar to that.LesNote:Game is not free to play. After first mission, you need to activate game for 25USD."

Let's say you like strategy games, obviously, youre looking at this game right?  But maybe you don't have time to play Civ 5 or Endless Legend.  Or you don't want to make the time investment for those games right now.   What options do you have if you want to play a world conquering grand strategy game.  Not many.In steps Legends of Callasia.  This game is akin to super Risk(the boardgame).  It's a dudes on a map game with some extra stuff thrown in to make more interesting.  That extra stuff includes heroes, you can't move armies around without them, ala Heroes of Might and Magic.  You also have cards that can boost your kingdom, think strategy cards, or can help in battle, think tactics cards.  These add enough flair to make it better than risk.  Throw in a bunch of different maps and multiplayer  and you've got a game you can get some mileage out of.I did a quick video series shopwcasing the campaign, that you can check out if you want to see the game in action.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOwS9qxK4jk"

I was looking for maaaaaaaaany years for a simple game of this kind.Total War series is unplayable for me.But even if I could play it I find the autoresolve battle of this game a lot better than the autoresolve of total wars.The only thing, like all games, you have to give it a chance, you have to be a little patient in the first couple of sessions until you learn the basics.What are roles of the units in battle etc.ps:Im playing the free version so I cant give any advise about the content/price ratio after the release. For now you can try it for free."
76561197993941602,Recommended,438920,27689190,"Posted: 26 November, 2016",all,CptBlunt,For me this game is a cross between Risk and Heroes of Might and Magic. If you like those games you will probably like this one.
76561198011864330,Recommended,438920,33739573,Posted: 23 July,all,baggywhacker,"With some games, we tend to concentrate on all sorts of factors that seem important, and overlook the one that's the most important of all - fun! This game is just great fun to play! I kind of enjoyed the free version, and figured it was worth the punt at what's a pretty reasonable price. I have quite a few digital board games in my library so I was just expecting this to be another to come back to from time to time, but I was pleasantly surprised that it immediately became my new favourite game.As has been mentioned, it's basically a beefed-up version of Risk, and the short review is, if you like Risk, you're going to like this. The only major differences are:youimproveterritories you own, either with a town or a tower (or the odd portal from time to time) for most territories, or several upgrades for the main cities;heroes- armies only move around the map attached to a hero. You'll generally have 2 to 4 heroes wandering round the map at a time. Each hero has specific stat buffs - some are defenders, some have missile bonuses etc.each map is ascenariowith specific objectives, and various factions that you either fight or ally with. You don't have to take over the whole map and conquer everyone (although you can if that's your thing!)there arecardsthat you can play for certain specific effects, some combat-related, some economic, and so on, and using the right card at the right time can have a huge impact.To address some of the specific criticisms that have been made against the game:Graphics- I think this is pretty misguided, to be honest. It's a digital board game, not some cutting edge 3D/VR title! The graphical style is charming, quite cartoony, and in any event, it looks a damn sight better than my old Risk board!Multiplayer- don't know, haven't tried, don't care. For some people, multiplayer is the only thing they care about, but this is a perfectly good single player game. You might be able to rush through it if you really want to, but I see I've already clocked up 30hrs and I'm only at the start of the second of 4 campaigns. That's pretty good value for money! (I admit I do like to take my time with games I enjoy, so I don't just rush to complete the scenario objectives in as short a time as possible, I like to take over the entire map and improve every single territory, just because).Complexity.... Some people have said it's too simple. Listen, I love strategy games, but if complexity was the be-all and end-all of every strategy game, we'd all be sat playing Gary Grigsby's War In The East 24/7 and poring over 1,000 page instruction manuals trying to sort out problems with diesel distribution in the eastern Urals. Complexitycanbe good, but sometimes you just want a nice straightforward game that'sfunto play without needing a degree in tactical theory. Someone pointed out that it's ""only"" got 6 unit types per race (which funnily enough is how many pieces there are in chess, and no one ever criticises chess for being too simple!) and ""only"" 4 races (so that's one more than Starcraft, the greatest strategy game of all time - yes it is, don't deny it).Ha, I've just noticed that War In The East is one of the ""More Like This"" games for LoC, that's a stretch!In SummaryReminds us that, in an age where we're in danger of obsessing about graphical engines, fps, always-online multiplayer ranking and impenetrable manuals, there's one thing that trumpseverythingin a game - is it fun? This game is fun.Oh, and if you like Riskat all, this a no-brainer."

,Recommended,438920,29557410,Posted: 28 January,all,kephri,"Legends of Callasia is a nice game about simple strategy. You build and move armies to a point where enemy cannot fight back. What is clever is, it takes time to build a strong army, and campaigns are made to counter you by AI in a smart way.The whole game is very nice, I will recommend it for any risk or 4x strategy master, it's just a simplier game with shorter mechanics in fantasy."
,Recommended,438920,24743127,"Posted: 6 August, 2016",all,pinback,"A minor masterpiece, this is the perfect strategy game for people who love strategy games but don't have hours and hours to pour into a more complex title.Comparisons to Risk are understating the matter, though -- with hero abilities, empire building, perks applicable with cards, and a variety of units, it feels a lot more like a (very) streamlined AGEOD game, or 4X game.So you get all that, an absolutely gorgeous art style, and can complete a full game within 30-60 minutes, it hits the sweet spot for those who like conquering kingdoms but don't have a ton of time to do it.Highly, HIGHLY recommended.  All of the negative reviews are from people who are confused that they have to ""pay"" to be able to ""receive a product"".  Which, life is going to be very difficult for them going forward, I fear."

It reminds me of Risk with three diffrent levels of of minions that you can attatch to Hero's.  With an ultimate goal of well trying to take over the world.  You also have bonus Cards you draw each turn that add interesting twists to the game Each hero has its own bonus perk that it adds to the units or city you place it in. time inbetween games can very depending on skill level of each player ultimatly I think anyone would enjoy this game.

Only big negative is the combat feels random because they've speeded it up so much it is hard to know what is going on.  That means that the fun of figuring out army unit mix is a bit sucked out of the game."
76561197973221592,Recommended,438920,25860685,"Posted: 4 October, 2016",all,ssi-guy,"A really solid strategy game. It scratches a bit of that HoMM itch. While not overly deep in mechanics, what is there is so well balanced and tight that the game provides a just-one-more feeling. Props also for the manually-designed maps. I have no problems with dynamically generated maps but getting to play on these is a treat with intelligent, interesting and challenging layouts across many, many different maps."
76561198005123355,Recommended,438920,28198611,"Posted: 4 December, 2016",all,Miss Kat,"This game is something of a hidden gem right now. It's a really great combination of Risk (the board game) like strategy with   kingdom building as you capture and improve territories. In addition to that, the players get cards which can cause additional effects to occur on the board, which can very quickly alter the balance of power if used in the right time and place.This game is very much worth the low price it's going for right now and if you've ever enjoyed strategy games like Risk I highly recommend you give it a try."
76561198029615366,Recommended,438920,28168123,"Posted: 3 December, 2016",all,Jolly,"This is a gem of a game.  Another example of a low cost indie game that delivers.It's somewhat a light variant of HOMM or AOW (with a smidge of Risk thrown in).  It has enough depth to be satisfying but also has enough simplicity to allow you to finish a map (campaign or skirmish) in an hour or two.  While I like beefy strategy games that take days/weeks to finish it's also nice to sometimes have a game that is fun in a shorter amount of time.Excellent mechanics, nice variety in factions, campaign play is enjoyable, skirmishes with a ton of maps and variety to pick from to add extra oomph.  The cards you can play thru the game also spice things up and add some extra oomph.  Excellent UI and controls.  It all ties together to make for a very fun experience.This game is not getting nearly the buzz it deserves."

I had a bit of doubt from the start from some of the reviews, but I decided to trust him on it (you know who you are!).... and I've not been disappointed!Pros: great graphics, amazing soundtrack, pretty fun and addictive gameplay as it does play like a boardgame! Multiplayer (which is why I bought this game for) seems really promising!Cons: looks deceivingly simple but so many things to consider! I will need to take some time on this!Would definitely recommend!"

From the day I have discovered Gothic, I was looking for the next game that will take me by suprise and keep me playing for hours.I have always enjoyed sort of table top/board game/risk like games. We have had some in the past like 2-3 risk games, Slay by Sean O'Connor or Desktop Dungeons. I was wondering what will be the next one to capture my attention and here it is: Legends of Callasia.This game is an excellent example that there is still room for improvement within an existing genre. It has it's own unique style and what it aims to achieve it does superbly so.I have recently finished Rise of Tomb Raider and have been frustrated by the game's artificially inflated systems that were design to create an impression there is variation and different options. Instead RoTR has created a boring environment where I was just getting frustrated that devs have introduced 2-3 things that are basically the same and are not only pointless but also annoying, like the arrow head climbing.In Legends of Callasia every card, every unit or building serves a specific function and has it's use. I also enjoy the visuals, they are crips, bright colours allowing you to quickly read the situation on the map. Little touches like clouds or dragons flying over the map show the attention to detail. I also greatly enjoy the short briefings before each campaign mission which give you useful info on where from to expect an attack.Games even has room for some plot twists. That along side with custom objective in the campaign really creates nice challage. Another thing worth mentioning is the replayability value and it is pretty great in this game. I have played one map multiple time and each time I ended up executing different strategies.Game always you to skip battles if you do not wish to watch them.The only two things I would list as negatives (not ruining the experience but fixing of those would make the game near perfect):- if there was some well design system to actually play battles manually that would add another layer of depth, but this would have to be well designed really or otherwise it would spoil a great game- I wish there was a way to complete skip watching the time between turns and make it go faster, but I know that many turn based games suffer from it (total war series for example).TL:DR version:Great game, offering good level of chalange, engaging, with both single and multiplayer, worth it's full price."
