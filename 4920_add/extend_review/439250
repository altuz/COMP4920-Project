Basically you are looking for your Dad. After a small landing proplogue you are trapped at the spaceport and must get out of there. For the first act the riddles don't seem easy. But if you find somehow a solution then you can proceed straightforward through Act II and Act III. Win a billards match, win an ape race, take a tank ride, free a prisoner, enter a discotheque and escape a cavern on a mystery island. You will always encounter a mixture of comedy, adventure, thinking and combining. Most funny I found that you made Gail Pilgrim to wear a red dress. At the end it is announced that the story will be finally concluded with Ep. IV."
,Recommended,439250,21071204,"Posted: 9 February, 2016",all,Vic=HKC=,"Gail Pilgrim and her co-pilot Sabina White set course to Leto, in Delta Pavonis. After ousting the police out of their spaceship and helping the rebellion, they need to stay low. Leto is a planet with many retired rebels or pilots and Gail's dad is living there. So, while Sabina will try to get Emet out of the space port and make sure that the android isn't spotted, Gail will try to find her dad as he disappeared and help friends of his... Seems to be easy, eh?This third game continues the plot from the second episode. As usual, it's full of humor, of Gail putting herself in impossible situations, though Sabina is now joining her in that field. True, the ending wasn't the one I was expecting and I'm eager to discover the final episode but it's nice to have a story that isn't revolving around space ships.The gameplay is still the same, you discuss with people, you take items, you use them or combine them and you try to make people happy so that you can reach your goal. The fact that you can go where you want is nice too, mainly in Gail's part of the story, where she's using a map to reach each district of the town.The game is made with RPG Maker. It didn't change. However, what changed mainly is Gail and Sabina's appearance. No more long hair, no more nice haircut. Nope, you're under the impression that they're coming back from a huge rain. I can understand the need to make Gail look like an adult as she was looking like a teen in the previous games. However, while I don't mind the removal of freckles, I do think that her new look isn't the best. Also, I loved the goggles too from the first game. Anyway, the fact that you're leaving finally space and the Quicksilver, Gail's ship, is a good change. You're now on a planet, even if the first act is only in the space port. Gail is in the city and you even have a beach, so...The soundtrack is good too: when you enter the café, it's like you're into an old one, with classic songs. However in Club Venom, it's loud beats.Finally, this game is longer than 1 hour. I've played nearly four hours, only because I didn't save my game and that I exited with a wrong move. So, I must say that in 3 hours, you can finish the game.The price is still interesting, despite the game being longer. So, yeah, while Space Pilgrim isn't the most innovative game in terms of gameplay, it's getting better each time (apart for Gail losing more and more of her appearance each time). So when is the fourth and final episode released? Because I'm really eager to discover what will happen to Sabina and Gail!"

The jokes themselves range from cringe-worthy to giggle-worthy 1-liner's, & add quite a few light-hearted moments. The story is in full-swing now & i'm pretty keen to find out how it all ends.The graphics are the usual space themed RPGMaker art of the previous episodes.This episode has the best soundtrack by far, including a couple of old-time Al jolson (i think?) songs, as well as a few classical music tracks (maybe by Mozart?). My favorite by far however was the catchy ""What Shall We Do With A Drunken Sailor"" playing in the Bar area, which even features what i think was a German translation of 1 of the verses.As with the previous Space Pilgrim games, i'd probably consider this more of a Point & Click game than a RPG, but who cares about the genre, it's a really good story & i've had fun with every episode so far (finger's crossed for Ep.4).As with the other episodes, it's a fairly short game, but for the low price i do think u get ur $$ worth."

It's a good improvement over what was already a pretty competent- if low budget- game.Once you get out of the spaceport you'll have quite a few areas and buildings to explore for clues and items: the puzzles are a bit more complex and sometimes rely on small objects in the environment or joining multiple items together. I must also say that for the first time in the series I was slightly stumped a couple times as, for example, you were required to go back to certain locations to see new events: it was nice to see the game providing some challenge.The story flows, and there's some ties to previous games that I won't spoil: I still don't see much of an engaging overarching plot but I hope episode IV will finally clear things up and provide a good ending.All things considered Episode III is an advancement for this decent little saga and it's a good purchase for its fans."

Oh, and there's character development too. Sort of.Only thing I disliked about this part was the side-scrolling part of the game where you run around in Hope City. While graphics are not the main focus of this game, those sections do indeed look quite bad and somehow plain compared to the rest of the game.Oh, and the game had an (apparently rare) game-breaking bug. It took the developer a day or so to fix it once I posted about it on the game's Steam forum. For that, I give an extra +++ although personally I just started a new game before the update happened."

Only play this after you've played Space Pilgrim Episodes I & II, as the story continues from there. As like before, the game is in adventure point-n-click format and you can play using either keyboard, mouse, or a combination of both.VerdictA worthy investment at the price point I bought it (below $1). The story advances, gets more intriguing, and there's a lot of adventuring to be had. Many locations to explore, people to meet, and puzzles to solve.

I really enjoyed the first two so this one being loner just adds to the fun. I like to see the expanded story and dialogue. Everything is pretty much simlar but the puzzles are a bit trickier and usually take up more time. The map is also larger so there's lot to explore. My only complaint is that my save file was somehow deleted so I lost all my progress which was 5 plus hours and I hadn't even finished the game.  Aside from that I really recommend playing.

,Recommended,439250,21389667,"Posted: 22 February, 2016",all,Paikia,"Duplicate warning:This is pretty much the same review I wrote for each of the two previous episodes of Space Pilgrim, so if you've already read either one of them, don't waste your time with this one.Space Pilgrim is a cute and short point & click adventure game, which kind of reminded me of the old Sierra quests from the 1990s, except it took me couple of hours to beat. The graphics are nothing special, there's hardly any music or sound effects, but the story is nice and funny, just enough for this game to be worth it, considering its price.The only aspect of the game that really got me annoyed was the user interface. It took me way too much time to figure out where and how many times I needed to click to use or combine items. Also, whenever there's a dialog box open, it seems like the mouse cursor doesn't need to actually be inside the box to choose an option. Too many times I ended up clicking somewhere outside the dialog box (for whatever reason), just to accidently choose something to do or say.TL;DR - A nice low-budget point & click adventure. You can enjoy it as long as you don't expect too much."

You'll spend most of your time looking for items and reading the story.MusicThe music is great like the other episodes which reflects the environment very well.GraphicsSurprisingly, there are a lot of new maps and graphics in this game compared to the last two episodes. The mappings are great as usual although a ""world map"" is introduced which looks unfitting with the other beautiful sprites. The UI color is changed like the other two episodes too.However, there is a collision bug in the supply room in Act 3 where you can go through the wall beside the left room's opening. I checked the discussion thread and it turns out that there is someone who is already reported it months zgo and it still doesn't fixed until now. It doesn't really affect the game at all though.StoryThe story is a continuation from episode 2 which will be concluded in episode 4. Although i thought that there will be no more references from episode 1, an old character from episode 1 is reintroduced in the game.  However, i must say that this game is the longest from all three episodes, with a doubled length which makes me quite surprised. There are four acts instead of three, although one act is divided into two parts. Each parts' length are basically the same as an act's length which makes me prefer to say that there are four acts.The story flows well from episode 2 and the introduction of the characters are done smoothly. Unlike the first two episodes, you will be able to move more than one character. There is a password for the safe in Act 2, part 2 which can be lost after you do a certain actionby releasing the Colonel and letting him go. If you forgot the password, then you'll have to look for the password outside the game.Pros:- Long and well thought storyCons:- A password which was used for opening a safe can be lost foreverConclusionThis is an adventure RPG Maker game about fugitives which are residing in a city and looking for a way to meet one of the member's dad.Should you buy this game?Yes.If you love the first two episodes, buy this game. If you never play the first to episodes, you better play at least the second episode first in order to understand most of the story."

,Recommended,439250,34675550,Posted: 1 September,all,Kuzhara,"Delta Pavonis is part three in the Space Pilgrim saga.This is the first game in the series to introduce more areas for you to explore, however it gives you a simple map screen so that you can visit different ""hub spots"" on the planet Leto. Leto is a haven of old veterans, corrupt cops and criminal gangs. This one is the first that seems to get the length ""just about right"". There's plenty of new puzzles to solve, more character development and both new and old characters and enemies. Overall it'll probably take you about four or five hours to complete this one, depending how much you appreciate puzzles.I'm not going to spoil the ending of this part in the story, but let me just say that owning the fourth part is a total MUST.All in all, I would probably give Delta Pavonis a 9/10.

I suggest playing them in order to get the best grip of the storyline though, however, even as a sole game it has an estimated playtime of 4 hours.10/10, even Zubar would meow at it."

This game is a continuing story. That said:Once again these episodes are proving to be far better than you would expect for the $2 entry fee.Episode 3 is by far the largest episode so far, and I had put in about 5 hours by the end, more than double what the previous two episodes had taken me. It starts a little slow, with a lot of footing around a spaceport, basically doing fetchquests. I was feeling a bit disappointed, but when you hit Act 2, things really open up. You actually get to explore the the city, now I don't want to mislead anyone, this is not some open world thing we are talk about here. There are various districts that you get to travel between, travelling via a rather nifty transport screen. Each little hub is not particularly large, but there are quite a few locations there, certainly enough to give the illusion of a large city. Also the focus shifts from fetch questing to solving the mystery of your dads disappearence, which adds back some much need urgency. The third act I'll leave a mystery ;)Overall this was another great episode, though I'm knocking down a point simply because of pacing issues with act 1.8/10"

Personally, I'm here for the story, the game play is the same as the first two parts, which is running arround figure out how to finish errands. I'm fine with that but there's not much new stuff here. If you've played the first two parts, you already knew what to expect out of the game. I don't recommend you play this part without at least playing the 2nd part.I enjoyed this game, a good casual story telling. The quests are just to progress the plot, and very deterministic so you can't fail."

As a fugitive and a harborer of rebels, I think you have earned a vacation to Hope City with your father. Sounds like a nice change from all of the crazy stuff that has happend.This game has really good music, ok visuals, good characters, some nice callbacks to the other episodes, great atmosphere, some funny interactive lines and the charm from the first game, but sat in Hope City and not on the Quicksilver.There are some new puzzles and alot of new characters.There are 7 acheivements and badges.This is a cheap but fun rpg adventure puzzle game that is the second to last episode in the series. If you do not like episodic games then I thnk this might rub you the wrong way, but if you do not mind it then this might be a series you wanna chack out.Have fun, enjoy and we're on vacation :)"

Im planning to write a general review, and i will mention the related episodes if its necessary.Pros:+Great flick to spend some quality time+Cheap and gives you your moneys worth+Funny and interesting characters and dialogs+Way better than others games done with RPGMaker+The series get better with each episode+Subtle ongoing jokes+Point-and-click elementsCons:-It's a bit short (Only Episode I)-Ending feels a little cut short (Episode IV)-If you are a hardcore adventure gamer, you might not like it-Lacks music, beside the sound effects, (try Zelda Calm from youtube, really works well with the game)-You can feel the production is still amateur, you can tell its just done by RPGMaker-Couple of bugs (really minor stuff though)Overall, I can say that Space Pilgrim is a soft adventure game series, with minor problems, that starts good, and ends better. It's really a good way to spend some time. It REALLY requires music though... I can safely recommend this game to everyone, and im hoping the see more projects from Pilgrim Adventures if they keep going like this!"

After much improvement in part 2, I expected the game to maintain course in part 3.  Instead, part 3 is more significantly improved than part 2!  The game length is much longer than part 2.  There are more locations to explore, more people to interact with and the story gets deeper and engaging.  All of this at a steal price.For players who already played part 1 and 2, it is a must to play part 3.  For those who are new, it is highly recommended to play part 1 and 2 since the game is more of a continuation rather than a stand alone.I don't play too much RPG Maker games but this series certainly is a treasure in my Steam library.  Personally, I do wish they had a season 2.  I think many people who like the series will be on board with this."
