76561198030916122,Recommended,439340,29688789,Posted: 4 February,all,squigglyhopper,"I've not played this game long but so far I'm liking it. I played Theme Hospital to death as a child so I knew immediately how to play the game but I imagine others might struggle. It took me a while to figure out how to research, I think the tutorial could be better to explain this.I think this game has massive potential and even as it is it is very playable."
,Not Recommended,439340,29616637,Posted: 31 January,all,Cerzi,"Right now it seems to be a stripped down uninspired reskin of Theme Hospital.It's a nice idea, and there's definitely potential to build some interesting gameplay on what's there, but right now it doesn't have enough going on.  The interesting fantasy/medieval theme isn't really anything more than superficial - everything from the music, to the ""inspections"" (tavern inspectors with top hats and suits really clash with the setting), to the bank loans and worker pay rises just feels lifted from Theme Hospital without much thought.There aren't a huge number of bugs, which is something.  But there's definitely some nonsensical stuff, and some really maddening design choices (like having to wait over a minute for an unskippable slow-motion performance of a man being hit by a turkey when you lose).There's a lot of interesting things that the developer could do with the fantasy tavern setting.  For example, having external/random threats come and disrupt the tavern, and then being able to offer quests to visiting adventurers in order to fix/resolve them (for a price).  Thieves and drunks that need to be handled by security (who, too, could be hired adventurers).  I mean, just take a look at a tavern from an old school RPG - there are plenty of ideas to draw from.Will keep an eye on the game and update review later on if things change."
,Not Recommended,439340,31353216,Posted: 25 April,all,SkepticDK,"After reading the entire forum, bug lists and reviews I decided to buy the game. As it is right now, things are slowing starting to worry me. The game is still having many bugs – some really silly ones. The developer will only consider sandbox and won't comment on this part, so if you're looking for sandbox, do not buy this yet.The developer is quite active on the forums – but is in a weird kind of way. Can't tell if he's annoyed with critics or not. The sentences is very short and very straight forward. Either he likes your idea or he doesn't.There havn't been an update since I bought the game – though the patchnotes is on the forums, we still havn't been able to download it yet. Still waiting.For now, I won't recommend the game, sorry. That can easily change! :D Its a fun game for sure."

It's only in early access but I've had so much fun (and still am) with this game.Pros:The game slowly introduces a lot of fun mechanics (Rats, Reasearch, Fights, Guest Types, Activity Rooms, etc..AND THOSE ****ING KIDS)Gives a lot of FREEDOM for the creative types (designing an entire Tavern and unleash your inner O.C.D)This game has a nostalgic feel to it. Kinda reminds me of Roller Coaster Tycoon 3. Which is a really good thing IMO.The staff managing system is really clean and easy to useCONS:A few bugs here and there but nothing serious!Editing an existing room is sooo ANNOYING. For example; If you make a room and later decide to add more to it, you can't pause and edit, which leads to a lot of guests loosing happiness and your reputation PLUMMITS. But this is only an issue if you don't plan your tavern ahead (like me, oops)The pricing system for drinks, rooms and activities seems to have no effect on normal diffuculty (not sure about the higher ones) but it means I can charge 5,000,000g for a pint and they pay up... A MANAGERS WET DREAM WOOOO!!I'm still getting laughs out of this game and only a few of the massive list of levels are out! I look forward to what comes from this game. If you enjoy tycoon games, PLAY THIS GAME!"

Wonderful controls, it looks nice, gameplay is fun,etc.. it just needs more content (I can't wait for a sandbox/endless mode!) and it will be fantastic!Should you get it right now? Well that depends how much you like or dislike early access? If you don't mind seeing a game being developed then pick it up asap, it WILL be a wonderful game when it is fully done. But if you would rather wait till it is finished, then by all means wait and pick it up on release.As of now it is a fun time to play but it is lacking content. This is a smaller dev team than most games, but to be honest the base of what is here atm is a wonderful start and I can't wait see where it goes from here!PS: There was a new big update tonight for those who say this game never gets updates."

First impressions are positive but it needs a lot of work (thus the EA).  I loved Theme Hospital and I love this idea and the graphics.  I think there is a lot of potential here.Hey, you could have people turning themselves into frogs in the arcane shop, people droping barbells on themselves, blowing up themselves with potions, The fun thing about Theme Hospital was the very bizarre and funny diseases people got and then how to fix them. Here, I think you wouold need to play on the ""lighter"" side of Heroes, witches, Ogres, etc... Hey, why not a Shrek lookalike with Donkey or a dragonslayer coming in all toasted and smoking, looking for a bath. Lots of options to think about. The issue is - what are the problems to solve and how will you solve them in the inn?Sleepy and need of rest - bed chamberhungry/thirsty - food/drink in barknowledge to become better wizard - libraryToilet needs - BathroomBath? - BathroomBeefing up/strength improvement - workout roomConfidence buildier - how about a magic mirror to tell you how great you are.Fencing improvement - Fencing master workshopSexual prowess - how about a wench bar? :)I think the options are really limitless here and could be the source of a lot of simple humor.Maybe this isn't the direction you wanted to go in, Peter, no offense. Just suggestions.So, bottom line, good start but needs a lot of bug squashing and added optionsNeed to do list.Add rotate screen and zoom, also 4k supportAdd sandboxAdd many more room types and character types (heroes) as per above examplesI have great hopes Peter.

,Recommended,439340,29620553,Posted: 31 January,all,Eldon The Noble,"So logged a couple of hours on it so far...Great game with huge potential.Several bugs, one of which broke the game, which was a couple of guests clipped into the wall and would not get out and when I reloaded it, it would never reload. But all the current bugs are easy fixes.It does need a few things like camera zoom, and being able to add items to a room after you have finalized it, but I am sure those things are coming.The music is actually rather annoying and does not fit the medieval/fantasy theme that is here.Reminds me of the Caesar series, in that you move from one tavern to another one with greater difficulty.Overall, if you are big into resource management games, and are fine with playing alpha games then you will like this.Also as a side note, there are certain parts of the game that seem really polished and there are other parts that need a lot of help, it makes it quite comical to see the big difference."
76561198118880023,Recommended,439340,29803985,Posted: 9 February,all,Balls of Steel,"This is a very good game with a huge potential. But I found some glitches which (if fixed) could make the experience even better.1. Lord Peter gets stuck at Stage 3 (he can't move and can't evaluate the Tavern).2. I built 7 Guest Rooms (4-5 empty most of the time), but still I find guests waiting for a room to be vacant. Please fixthis as guest rooms are a huge source of income.3. If you are making a zone (for anything like staff room, rest room, etc.) and you want to place all the furniture again,you are charged again (twice) for the same furniture.This game has lots to come. There are only 4 stages available at the time. I could see easily spending 10+ hours on these stages alone.One more thing, I started playing on ""Super Easy"" which gets pretty tough at Stage 3. I can't imagine what ""Difficult"" would be."

76561198002567771,Recommended,439340,30384973,Posted: 7 March,all,Xenus Icelon,"Running your own tavern? Sounds like an interesting and possibly relaxing game doesn't it? Interesting for sure, but not quite relaxing yet. Tavern Tycoon - Dragon's Hangover has a lot of potential with an interesting premise, and at the time of writing(2017,03,08) is still in early access. So anything in this preview will be subject to change.Very clearly inspired by Theme Hospital, Tavern Tycoon has you building similarly, with similar looking mechanics that still differ when you get below the surface of them. At present, it seems to use a similar system - Someone comes in, goes to the bar, and gets drinks until they need to go to the restroom. From there on they will attempt to go to other rooms before they finally are satisfied and leave happily, or they get angry at your tavern and leave in a bad mood.Now, as it is early access you can still expect bugs, crude balancing and other parts that need polishing, the most notable bugs and complaints I've found were that rooms stop functioning with guests refusing to use them(Thus becoming angry at the long wait and leaving), everything being expensive to the point a single bench costs 5 or more months of wages for a staff member, and the timescale being incredibly fast- There is no pausing to design a room, months pass in what feels like a matter of seconds which makes it nearly impossible to make a profit without doubling your prices from the default(Not to mention stressful as you are immediately under pressure to build everything), and many pieces of furniture not being functional yet.Many more things are not perfect yet, but it shows that the ideas are there, there is someone actively working on them and there is a functional build with more to come.Even then, it is pleasant to run a functional tavern and it has the beginnings of something that could be very interesting and even challenging to play, but still frustrating thanks to the bugs and unpolished nature of early access.There is certainly great potential here, but at present it is untapped and unpolished. I've found it to be a bit too close to Theme Hospital to make the tavern theme truly work, but that may still change as updates are made and it develops into more of its own thing. My suggestion for those looking into it would be to wait- At least for the bugs and balancing to be adjusted, or you're going to be frustrated more often than not. But if you need to make a decision right now on whether to buy it or to never look at it again, I would say it is worth the risk. The price is low and the basics are there to enjoy it if you try to ignore the worst of the unpolished parts."

Even the room design, number of staff, inspector and the rats are from TH. However, it has not got the same amazing sense of humour (at least not at the time of writing). Also, there are still a lot of unfinished detail (including a pause button). I really hope that when finished, it will live up to its predecessors excellence. So, with a lot of hope, this game is strongly recommended."

It is an early release, and I love the premise of it.  Run a bar full of drunks, fighters, mages, noblemen.  The room ideas are good.  You could ride ThemeHospital's additions to a full game of interesting strategic elements: where can I fit this room, you need a spa to make champions happy, research that turkey leg!Unfortunately its not quite there yet.  There's a lot of gameplay issues that should get reviewed before I would feel like this game is ready.-Moving handymen onto spills or barf doesn't prompt them to clean it, they just wander away.-Editing rooms or even just moving a table takes a menu action, then a highlight, then another menu action, then you can reposition.  Right click to move objects.  Single click room edits.  Please. Please. Please.-ECONOMY NEEDS FIXED.  Why does a bar cost 1200 gold but you get 30 gold per drink. You break even after 40 drinks.  Not including the bartender staff costs.  You will never recover this gold.  You will almost never recover gold spent on improvements.  Revenue from the tavern covers staff costs, that's it.  A potted plant costs 580 gold.  Beer costs 30 gold.  To recover the gold spent on a plant takes serving 20 people at the bar.-No feedback on how you're doing.  There's nothing to say why people are leaving unless you hover over them, I don't know if liquor is popular, or if I'm making back gold on the guest room I built (also stupid expensive and never recovering gold).-Special events, Lord Peter wants a reservation of X people.  Every month.  Switch this up, make barbarians just show up, have a legendary hero come in and if he's happy he boosts booze sales or reputation.I don't have any issues on the graphics of it, it looks like it belongs in the 2000's but grahics are not why you're playing a tavern management game.  Hoping that over time we get some extra polish on this game because conceptually it's great.It's ten bucks, if it fixes some of the issues it's totally worth it."

,Not Recommended,439340,34768103,Posted: 5 September,all,H3X,"The idea of this game is neat, but in its current state fails to deliver much logic to your success, if ever. While I enjoy a game introducing me to its mechanics in an immersive manner, this one fails to introduce them at all. When I feel like I have created an optimal layout, attempted to manipulate pricing optimally, and hire a cost efficient staff the game expects more than the tools it gives provides. It is of minor note that I am playing on the 2nd highest difficulty, but it should not be impossible. I have restarted many times and even started on a higher difficulty for the first mission until I found it was numerically staggering to complete with the slow and infrequent progression my tavern experienced. Overall, the game is untuned and not that interesting visually. For a management game there are few decisions to make, and bugs also seem to be a large problem that I didn't elaborate on (Sometimes your staff freeze, the game allows you to make some pathfdining errors, and other things that will make you fail if you're not alert for them).I hope to update this in the future when the game is in a state where its problems have been addressed. I really want to like this game."

However, several game-breaking or just frustrating bugs make some levels almost impossible to complete. Updates have been promised but not released, just the occasional ""soon"" from the developer when people make new discussions asking about progress with updates.If you're thinking about buying this game, I would wait to see progress on updates and whether or not the developer stays active.

He's done a good job and as far as I'm concerned it has panned out good. Eleven bucks for a game, yeah it's worth a buy. And on top of that there are features in the works to come out once he gets them ironed out. What people need to understand is that the updates will come out in time and early access really has no standards. Most the negative reviews come from the impatient. Just know it's one guy working on two EA titles and he may not pop out content updates every month. I'll give Peter a thumbs up as I feel he's not a fly by night con. Cut the guy some slack, report bugs and suggestions.  Theme Hospital meets Tavern tycoon. Looking forward to the final product Peter, keep up the good work."

But the game is stillearly in it's development and needs a lot of work done. I think it's already worth a few hoursbut not more.If the dev manages to keep up an acceptable pace of updates, managed to fix bugs, game balance/difficulty and to increase the depth of the game, then this could become a real treat for everyone who likes tycoon games.But mind you that it's a single dev working on this game and he still has another game in early access which seems to have slow development. So time will tell how he manages to support and develope both games or if he will ditch them.Since the game is relatively cheap and already in a very playable state for at least a few hours of fun, I'd say I wouldn't be too butthurt if the game never finishes or takes forever to finish."
76561198037769394,Recommended,439340,30204850,Posted: 26 February,all,BDTA,"So far, I feel this game is done very well for an Early Access product. That said, it is clear from playing the game that it is early access. I don't count that against the game as I'm having quite a lot of fun playing it currently. The things I have problems with so far are somewhat more minor annoyances with a few things that may just be personal preference. Keep in mind I'm writing this before completing level one ""In wine there is Wisdom"" and this is more of a first impressions review. I will edit as I complete more content:The tutorial in ""Level One"" explains just the bare basics, which is fine, but lingers just a little too long on each step. And for each step they don't allow you control for a certain amount of time, I assume to give you time to read. That said I feel that control should be given to the player and each step highlighted as the tutorial is going on so if someone can read fast or knows what they are doing they can go through the tutorial a bit faster.The game gives very basic explinations of each room/furnishing and doesn't do a great job of explaining what everything does, nor does it explain the stats very much on the employee's screens. I feel a separate tutorial level, or a help screen, explaining ALL the basics would be more efficient than the short tutorial in the begining of level one. Even if there are more tutorial segments after the completion of level one or in the begining of levels 2~4 (currently the only levels availible other than level 1) it feels like more information should have been given upfront.Research also feels like it takes way too long. I do not know if making a larger research room or adding more ""research ovens"" allows for more maidens to go research, but even then the speed at which one maiden researches a new recipie (with the slider at 30% improvement, 70% new recepie) feels extremely sluggish given the bar indicates reserch is just about 3/4 of the way complete after almost a year and a half in game time.Preformence Stages and Pianos appear to currently either not work or not have a real purpose yet as it doesn't seem anything happens when they are sitting in your tavern. They state something about musicians though they aren't hireable employees and the customers with lute's on their back seem to not do anything with them.Fireplaces seem a little wierd, I'm not exactly sure how they work. But the placement area seems to be a little large for the area they effect. Given that we can't put anything within what appears to be a two square radius of the fire place and it's area of effect idicator seems to be just a little over 3 squars in a circular format it seems not that great. It also doesn't seem to actually effect everyone in the area as it gives off this weird buff only once in a while to individual customers.The only bugs I've noticed are that sometimes your maidens and handymen will get stuck on eachother if they are taking a route that leads through a tight (less than once full clear space) area, such as between a table and a wall. That can be avioded by not placing anything too near walls, or placing doors in a spot that the game's pathing won't prioritize such a path, but I feel it's worth noting. And sometimes you can end up placing furnisings in rooms or places you aren't supposed to be able to by clicking proceed with furnishing in a strange place (example: Table in a staff room ontop of the couch/sofa.)I also feel a ""free mode"" would benefit this game, one that basically starts you off with a basic tavern and lets you buy extra side bits and expansions with the only objective being to not go bankrupt and make your tavern as profitable as possible. Maybe with optional random events/disasters.Overall I recomend this game, I think it's well made for what it is and the fact it's early access and appears to be being worked on seems like this product will only get better over time. For now some people might not like the $11 price tag, and if that's the case I'd say wait a bit and pick it up after some more work and development went into it. Either way I think the price is fine considering the game looks like it's being updated and worked on and currently is a lot better than a bunch of the other early access ""tycoon"" style of games."

There ARE unique animations and enough other original content to make this reskin ""rip off"" a far too strong of a term, let's say the similarities are eeeeerie.Absolutely needs to be balanced (even making things more expensive isn't enough - rooms max a 150/night etc), autosaving, ability to zoom in, MUCH more content (perhaps niche markets?), building objects in ""zones"" is too wonky (how many stalls in the bathroom did I just buy?), SANDBOX MODE, allow us to go negative in funds a bit before gameover... some examples of improvements.  I'm pretty patient and I've replayed the first round more times than I can count (normal mode), so unfortunately I have to walk away for now.  Oh and I wish one could click through the cut scene of the dwarf, hilarious though it may be.  I saw it far too much!  I will review again when it's more polished.  I should give it a thumbs down currently, I wish I could give it a middle ground, I'm going to give it a thumbs up in hopes of improvements soon.... it IS fully stable at least for me, and I LOVE games like this.

Game is a neat idea with a decent setting of old times tavern management.Graphics are fine and decent and to be slightly fair the price is reasonable certainly .But first off WHAT IS WITH THE AWFUL mouse pointer? wonky , unresponsive , slow and no option to change its sensitivity (and no its not my mouse or pc) just give us a normal sensible speed mouse pointer not a whacking great stupid hand that moves at a snails pace one second then a speed up the next. No option (clearly) to speed or slow time down , a must for any tycoon game and ive literally played hundreds , so the boring times you can spin through and slow down accordingly.Next the mails , jesus christ the mails , officialy the worst most annoying part of the game , every 5 seconds another mail , customers asking for reservations , monthly reports , your bosses reports , thats all fine no issue with receiving these but you HAVE TO keep clicking the mail box at bottom of the page (annoying mouse pointer alert) to click and open them then you read them if you can get the pointer to the mail to open it and then exit BOOOOM another mail ...back in we go , was suggested to developer 4 months ago and around about 6 to 7 patches ago to have a nice simple clean mail appear on left of screen so u can read /delete without keep going in to this annoying mailbox......er still waitingso i dont bother reading them anymore .Left the game for about 6 to 8 weeks a few patches later , nope excatly the same , really doesnt listen to ALOT of the advice of different ideas, its messy and a pain in the backside to play this game .slow ,boring and repetitive , i reallly wanted to enjoy it but clearly he/she/them are not listening to pretty much anyone .dont waste your money , plus only 5 levels to play(i understand that , building more etc) but95 percent of tycoon early access have sandbox available , i.e players able to experience the game with a small tutorial at start , nope and he has even said in posts ""yeah MAY do a sandbox , tycoon games have sandbox modes , ALL of them ,overall 5/10 idea fab, graphics meh yea not bad , price for the idea yep reasonableexecution AWFUL , mail/mouse pointer AWFUL , no sandbox AWFUL , annoying gameplay YEP ,slow and boring VERYavoid"

Fun, easily understood graphics, classic theme, takes inspiration from the best. Has a lot of heart and is very much headed in the right direction. This game is headed onwards and upwards, and so long as development continues on the same pace, this should be a fine little gem soon. I miss the old Theme Hospital, and I have enough faith to drop a tenner to support it's development.Please take this EA money to hire someone to reveiw the writing (it does not fit the theme or flow very well), and whip up or buy some better tavern music.

I have even went back to get your website to find out that I would have to log in to comment.. And because I do not want to go through all that trouble.. I have seen quite a few in the 2 hour play through today. Again, I understand that you are in earlier stage of development, but then again, why NOT use a free QA that players that pay for the game provide?Yes, I know I can go on your website and comment there.. but honestly.. I have so many accounts I have zero desire to create yet another one. If you would like to provide me with an email I can send them to you.

For not being fully finished, the concept and detail put into it are excellent. It has the fond familiarity of ""Theme Hospital"" and ""Roller Coaster Tycoon"" combined.As the Dev has not released the 0.2 version, I will have to update this review as needed. But so far, here are my Pros and Cons:Pros:-Stepping Stone map challenges are excellent. Keeps the game from getting boring-Diverse obstacles/ elements that keep the player engaged-While the game does give a very minimal guide to how to play, it doesn't do any ""hand holding"". It Allows the player to learn based off of ""cause and effect"".-Beginning of each chapter does suggest the player implement a key element, but it doesn't FORCE the player to do so (This was what I hated about ""Theme Hospital"")-The expansion of this could be ENDLESSCons:-No sand box option-Some minor bugs that can easily be remedied  by saving and reloading the game. The Dev has stated they are actively working on these issues-Mailbox feature is charming at first, but gets repeative with no new information. After a while it can get fairly annoying witth ""spam"" e-mails. The spam e-mails re-subscribe you every time you re-load the gameI look forward to the update! Thanks for a great game!BTW, Sips sent me here, and most games he recommends, I have no regrets of purchasing."

Peter is doing this game freaking like a boss!Well it seems the new visitors took a few threads, misunderstood what was going on as of late, and the speed readers and entitlement people of the world decided to complain half cocked.Vanilla version; As a developer, (Peter) was not happy with how Tavern Tycoon was turning out. He is a solo act, and took the initiative to fix it. So if Peter is not happy with it, how can we expect to be??So Peter went blazing saddles, re-worked areas till he was happier, and it took a bit longer than his weekly/bi weekly updates which had been spot on. So it takes time to do it right.So think before we write or speak... because if you don't get the word from the horses mouth, or demand answers, chances are you will end up as the other end of the horse.The comments and entitled society really was............ like putting and elevator in an brick shithouse... it just does not belong! LOLThis game is funny, fun, replayable and well done, and even more now.Peter, a true developer that cares.He is great with the community!So support this guy, he has earned it.We are not on Peter's payroll or anyone else for that matter, but we call it like we see it.Just professionals being honest.This guy deserves success and support, frankly he has earned it.When something is delayed for perfection, be patient, and take a breath.Go chill on another title for a week or two and give the guy time to entertain you properly.Initial Review Launch Day**************************************************************************'Let us begin in our first hour... a solid playable and well working Early Access game.He even stated possible kitchen glitches, which we did not experience. So far so good.Uplifting music, nice humor, and good diversity in what you can do and how you can play.Certainly is entertaining, and engaging. Nice little tutorial that says enough and still allows you to learn and explore.So we started on our own after the tutorial... so what to do.... ah ha....Named our tavern! Gotta spread the word.In the tutorial we built a bar, hired a rank bartender, had our first guest.That first guest decided to vomit a pile, aaaaaannnnnnddd....then another... someone can't handle their grog... but... on the brighter side.... gave us a hint...so we hired a maid, built restroom, couple crappers, and a wash basin. Use your shirt to whipe your hands folks... we're on a budget here!Phew... stable... guests coming, just booked a party of 10.Suddenly...  someone took a HEAVY LOAD and green gas now polluted the facility.What the F word! How do we fix this? Open a window... damn. Move the bathroom next to a window... oh now its blowing into the tavern!!SO we hired another maid since OPEN A WINDOW was not an option. Seems to be contained as long as no one leaves the door open.People need to sleep an eat... especially if that gas comes out of the restroom.. built both, and things seemed to go smoothly. Too many people getting drunk... got another maid... and had to get a receptionist that would not fall asleep on the desk and actually work so guests stop wandering... and wouldn't ya know it... More vomit! Hired another maid...  Suddenly we got an message... a visitor... but not just any visitor...Oh Sh*t... not that kind of S*** but an inspection!! From the local Lord mind you.Coming today... already passed on his first visit, now there is no notice...S**t in the air, on the floor, in our hair... what to do.... OH.... there was an oar to a small boat out back.... and since we are Up S**ts Creek, which coincidentally is the name of our tavern, we will begin to row up that creek... and wouldn't ya know it... without a paddle because the oar was too big and was flinging S*** everywhere.Fun, growing, only four levels to start... but total plan is 11 levels from what Peter the creator has said. Great replayability, fun, upbeat sound and worth the intro price right under ten bucks!Good price, great fun... and nothing tells us he is not going to finish the 11 levels as promised.We will keep you all posted... our gear;Running at 61-63 FPSNVidea GTX 960Intel I-7Samsung MonitorDDR3 12GBPeter, keep it up! You have done your reputation a good service, and certainly much better than our reputation was in the game.Now if only we could find what guests to keep out, that ate something that just AINT RIGHT!If our maiden cooked it, she surely is gonna get the boot.Wait.... nooo...no...nooo.... where is he going... bathroom is that away......Problem is now he is headed to the gym...

There are only 4 stages and the 4th one is bugged like crazy where you just start losing reputation point in a free fall of year 3. You can have your Tavern set up with everything in it and working great until it just suddenly stops working and dies even though you didn't change anything to make it happen.It is an early access game and Peter the developer is making regular improvements to it but it is FAR from being finished. I think more work should have been done before it was put on early access. If you don't mind waiting a while for the game to get finished then I can recommend it to you based on its potential and the developer working hard on it.If you expect anything more than a few sample stages then I don't recommend it at all. At this time I just can justify the cost for the little bit of game you get from it.

Right now it lacks content, and I hesitate to call it a  game. It is built by one person, and he is doing an admirable job, but it will sadly take a long time for Tavern Tycoon to be a great management game. I fear that by the time it is worth playing, Tavern Keeper will have been released by Greenheart Games, and then Tavern Tycoon game will loose out in that competition.There are many things I dislike about the current build. He just finished the problems with the benches being bugged, but I don't see the point of benches now anyway, as they are barely used. There is no explanations at all about how to make money. The Monthly reports cannot be the full picture. The only way to actually make money that I have found it to invite Lord Peter each time he wants to come for that +1500 gold and +20 reputation. There needs to be a zoning mechanic implemented, that allows you to define work areas (this kitchen will serve these tables), you should be able to build more than one exit to a room, the staff demanding raises is just insufferable, since you only have one month to respond, and time is running fast in this game... It just feels like a game of managing your mail box...Ok, rant over. Do not buy this game. It is not good.Edit: Just tried it again, just to confirm if it is crap. Confirmed. It is crap."

Particularly I've noticed an issue with tavern patrons getting stuck in narrow hallways. The UI also seems a little clumsy, and you don't get a lot of feedback about what parts of your tavern need improving- is it too cold, etc.However, the developer seems to be very active in sorting these issues out, and I'm confident this will end up an excellent little game by the time it leaves Early Access.If I had to make one suggestion, though, I would have to say that some of the music could use a little work.Anyway, 9/10. Good game (that's going to get even better) for a reasonable price. Well done."

After all that, my thoughts on the game are as follows:It's a cute game, that already has some nice features and enough content to keep me interested for 5 hours. The graphics are quite enjoyable and the controls when placing rooms and furniture are very easy to get a hang of.That being said, there will hopefully be even more added to the game to make it quickly rise up the ranks of some of the better tycoon games to be released in the last few years. If the developer, Peter, really puts forth the effort, I think this could be a very enjoyable game that I could see myself investing hundreds of hours worth of gameplay."

I can't find a pause button nor a speed up. The tutorial is terrible, are resetting the level I have to go through the whole dam thing again. But my biggest pet peeve is that there is no straight up option to add additional equipment to rooms.Now I might be being rough for a day one release, but the game has a good concept and if it's trying to be the next Theme hospital it should be good.

I thought it would be enjoyable, but it just doesn't manage it. I'm sorry, but I have to say I can't recommend the game, at the current time.I might look at it in the future, but right now it's a no from me. The gameplay is lackluster, there just doesn't seem to be much bang, and too simple in certain areas, too complex in others, that might just be me though.There are a few nice things in it though, so kudos to the developer for this (These are the only things that stopped me from trying to get a refund for this earlier, but he/she did a decent job with it), like the start menu, the glowing text buttons on a black background are VERY nice. The art in the game is really good but is let down by all of it's flaws.Though, if you feel like you want to try this game, you should atleast give it a try, don't let my review deter you, the game has good features, development may have stopped (as far as I'm aware) for now, but the game is atleast playable. Might not be as fun and enjoyable as it could be, but no game's truly perfect.Thanks for reading.(Disclaimer; I did try to get a refund from Steam, but I was refused due to the time I bought being too long ago to refund it, which is a bit silly if you just got around to it.)"

I cannot comment on something that isn't there. There's no 'neutral' recommendation. So between recommending or not recommend it, I don't recommend it based on my experience. I don't care if it's in its early access. This review is relative to my experience. If it does change upon fixes and updates, i may try it again and update my review if given the opportunity and time (but $11 for early access with limited features?). Thanks for your comments.i just played it and it was full of bugs that made the game totally unplayable... guests were stuck, clerks not doing their work, no one was checking in, and guests were stuck inbetween doors and no one was using the gym @_@..., the Lord would come in and randomly give me a 'Good Job!' or 'No no no' without any reason behind it. I have NO idea how to check the imminent status of my tavern other than the monthly reports (but by then it is too late). There's no way to get an accurate understanding of the situation, so the game needs more visual cues as to what is actively wrong. Why aren't there cooks and why do maids need to 'research' on new recipes? That sounds awfully strange. In Pizza Tycoon, YOU design the pizza and the 'slaves'-- i mean workers, can just execute it. In Roller Coaster Tycoon, you just need to initiate the research or meet requirements to attain certain rides. In Transport Tycoon, c'est aussi la meme choses. There's no room to play all of the rooms: gym, arcane study room, office (if it works, you would think office is required first before any management can be considered), spa, etc etc... while in keeping with guest rooms and anticipated revenue flow. No wonder maids keep walking out on the job in spite of me paying them 200+. Also the monthly reports would show like 10 guests but there were like hundreds in the tavern just walking around with their tired meter maxed out. Also there's no way to rotate screen so any objects behind walls cannot be deleted without you deleting the room obscuring it. Overall, it has great potential, but it needs more flexibility and options for growth/expansion to meet the declared self-nomination of a 'Tycoon' game and if it needs to attract the attention of millenials. In the future, I will still look out for any developments of this game.Conclusion: I had to get a refund."

Whilst the updates and hotfixes are steady but a lot is left to be desired as the game is still in development which can be translated as mostly playable and mostly broken. In this case however it is somewhere between the two and the latter part is when you play the game for a few hours is when you realize how bad it affects the game. For example the AI needs a lot of work. No detailed report to tell you about factors contributing to negative popularity. Getting a lot of visitors yet the montly report is inaccurate and says just two visitors. The group invitation by mail should be much more frequent or at higher levels should stop sending mails for a group of 2 or 4. The interest on the loan are quite high but are still manageable to a certain extent. I did a few experiments with it and in my opinion due to other factors such as number of visitors etc, the income can vary a lot and if you do not meet a certain threshold for the month, you will be forever stuck in paying of loans and never being able to recover from them. The food research takes forever and that is on fast forward. The folks visiting your tavern cannot seem to navigate well and will spend a lot of time pacing in a certain area doing absolutely nothing and they can get stuck to the floor, it can also happen with employees although that is much more rare. There is no description of what better rating employees do or the option to upgrade them to higher levels. The fire place takes a lot more space than it should considering we are given a limited space to work with. If you raise prices of your services, there is no indicator of whether your customers are okay with it or there is a decline due to your prices. Although common sense points to the fact that the better the business, the more prices you can jack up but here there is just a lot of guess work with very little outcome.Make no mistake though my comments are more of a suggestion to make the game better and not to bash the game, I knew the game was in development before I bought it and the game does have its strong points like cute characters, nice ambiance and good graphics, the sound is also pretty nice. I am really looking forward to see the direction in which the games move ahead.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This game is at a standstill with no updates and apparently the developer has made some wads of cash off the good folks here who genuinely wanted to help develop what could have been a great game, it seems quite a few ""developers"" have been taking advantage of early access to make a lot of money at the expense of the consumers.Developer    = $Steam        =  $Consumers  = =(I will be more than willing to change my review if things change but considering the track record of the developer (see DUST) I doubt it is happening any time soon.

One reason I chose to buy is that it's clear the devs intend to keep actively working and taking in feedback. So, here is mine so far!I'd like to see more ways to monitor reputation and funds - I've only played a bit so far, but I felt like I had very little guidance about what to do and how to reach my goals. Is my tavern clean enough? No idea. Do I need to hire more maidens because my customers are waiting too long? No clue. Are people wanting rooms and being turned away, so I should build more? No way to tell. Also, you get a lot of notifications and I find it mildly annoying to click on the message bar all the time. I also have very little understanding of the ""reservations"" task - okay, so people are going to come. What does that mean? What do I need to do for them? I have no idea if I can manage that reservation of 9, because I don't get what it means. Lastly, I don't see any way to edit rooms once placed. So, say I make a restroom with two stalls and later decide I'd be better with more stalls. I can't see any way to add more, I just have to build another restroom, which is a waste of precious space.

I don't review many games(maybe 1-2 others?) but I felt this one deserved a few words of praise and criticism.lets start out negative.1. there are LOADS of pathing issues, in my current game I have around 12 or so patrons all just standing around in different areas of my tavern ""Thinking about what to do next"" or something of that nature. its not a huge deal but it congests the tavern with people not spending any money :(2. about every 5-10 minutes I go to click on something from the task bar and will end up hitting the ""relocate"" button.this isn't TOO large of a deal, except that sometimes it will compeltely erase random pieces of furniture or rooms.(also when trying to add more items to rooms it sometimes freezes and locks up any clicking or task bar use)3. I'm sure its coming or has been requested, but a freebuild or sandbox mode would be awesome. not a god mode, just a free build. maybe you can start a map out with no building foot print and can create your own structures from the ground up?thats. it.PRAISE!1. I LOVE Tycoon games, and this is a wonderful example of one with SO MUCH potential of being great.2. its got a pleasent touch of comedy, I enjoy when devs throw some fun into games to make you smile or just a bit happy.(kids sneaking in?! awesome. losing and getting a full chicken thrown at a dwarf? excellent)3. it plays very well. I've had one decently sized tavern with a lot of patrons and it didn't start to lag not even once. graphics I don't think are meant to be anything remarkable, but aren't bad by any means.4. the replay value is very high. with all the different levels currently offered and load of difficulty settings, this has some replay-i-bil-i-tee.5. Devs seem pleased with the game and still enjoy making it. its been out for how many days and theres already 3 hotfixes? I love that!all in all a wonderful little game, I plan on playing it a bunch and will continue to watch what the devs do with it. (maybe a Tavern Town Tycoon?? ;)  )"

Everyone who liked Theme Hospital should get this game for sure.Yes there are bugs, which game doesnt have bugs??I mean it is earlys access and the dev is giving us almost daily updates for this game.It will never be a AAA game but for a simulation game and this much work coming frrom the dev, i guess the game will be super nice."

(still in early access remember?)Mostly the style are look like theme hospital, just different timeline.If you love that one, you'll love this one.(replay several time before get use to it)+ 1 support here"

And it's obviously a tavern.I give props to the developer, there is a gap in the market here and I personally have wanted to see Theme Hospital return.I've already completed stage 4, and the other stages are in development. It has very little depth or replayablity right now, but I hope it does well, as I'd like to see more development.I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Theme Hospital and wants to encourge developers to create games like this."

Highly recommended to check it out.Hopefully the updates keep on coming :)"
