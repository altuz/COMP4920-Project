76561197997810842,Not Recommended,439370,34769299,Posted: 5 September,all,Semi,"Although I do not recommend Midair in Early Access at this time (early Sept '17) I hope this can be seen as a constructive commentary on the game thus far. There are some strong positives and some concerning but fixable negatives. For the time being I have got a refund on the Early Access, but I'll be checking back to see if things have improved.It's clear a lot of work has gone into Midair, formerly Project Z, and that there is also a lot left to do. At this stage it feels like a proof of concept of a Tribeslike game. It certainly has issues but there is also a lot to like.Having played Starsiege Tribes, Tribes 2, Tribes Vengeance, Tribes Ascend (and Legions) I know that what is and what isn't Tribes has always been divisive and there opinions aplenty. I managed to enjoy all those games even if T1 & T2 still feel superior, Ascend's Weapon unlocks were the obvious low point of the saga.The problems I see with Midair right now are not ones that cannot be solved. Heres a list of the issues as I see them.- Movement does not feel right. Skiing and jetpacks are present but feel off. Perhaps because the Jump isn't integrated into Jetting perhaps? A separate unjetted jump should exist, but I think had jump also scripted into jet in T1 & T2 (almost 20 years, my memory is hazy). Lateral movement in the air feels slightly superior though, so that's a small plus. Ground movement when not jetting or skiing feels a little slow. As such the player controls felt a little awkward.- The UI is firmly in placeholder territory. It's just nasty. I do not believe the current elements can be tuned to improve them. For example, modding your loadouts does not need to fill the screen. Instead players should have an onscreen display that allows them to keep situational awareness of the game world.- The HUD isn't great either, but is more functional than the rest of the UI.- Player avatars profoundly disappointing. I was pleasantly surprised by the art style of the game buildings and vehicles, which I liked even though I wasn't sure at first, but I really do not like the player models. This may be a question of taste. It's possible to match the colourful style without making the players look a doofus generic cartoon character. Helmets at a bare minimum would improve matters, as would the traditional 5: Light female, Light Male, Medium Female, Medium Male and Generic Heavy (which both genders use).- Armour weights tied to a gender and race is jarring. I think this might also be a problem tied into the current player avatar design. I honestly don't care what gender or race I play as, but swapping between Light, Medium and Heavy armours I would like to have the same voice and gender. And yeah, I know all cappers will be female Lights because size. 1998: pick your voice, gender & appearance, 2017: get what you're given.--Biggest negative, however, is the intended business model. Free to play with Weapon unlocks. Just leave that ranking up nonsense to Callofdudebro and its numerous dreadful clones.Have everything unlocked and limit free players to the number of games they can play in an hour and day. Weapon unlocks have no place is a Tribeslike game.Well that's a lot of grumbling. So what did I like about the game...++ Despite my issues with the avatars, I like the look of the game world a lot. It's a simplistic art style that works well. With the speed necessary for a Tribeslike game, being able to resolve opponents and teammates in a fraction of a second is key. I think this is the Midair team's best decision (aside from making a Tribeslike game, of course!).+ Similarly the vehicles and base assets are also great. You should have no difficulty recognising what vehicle you're up against, even at long distance.++ From what I saw, most (probably all) of the weapons I remember are present. What I tested felt like they needed tuning. Not a huge issue and one that will evolve over time. Mostly damage values, area of effect sizes, rate of fire... all that sort of thing.+ So too are at least some of the equipment modifiers.+ The map design, while occasionally and unapologetically designed around skiing, looked pretty good. I will be interested to see how the Midair team reinterpret some of the classic maps but also what new designs they come up with.++ It's the most Tribeslike game I've seen since T1 & T2.So in the end. Is it Tribes? No, not yet but it's so very, very close. I do want it to suceed, but I reserve recommending it unless you personally have the time to dedicate testing an unfinished but promising game."

Although I do think the maps have a little too many small bumps which I know makes the maps harder, but I really think that it's too much, at least if they want a big crowd to play their game..(Maps are much harder to ski in than in T:A and generel movement is harder, don't know which I prefer yet need more time)"

76561197995142404,Recommended,439370,34488885,Posted: 25 August,all,Sarxis,"Reminiscent of the original Tribes franchise in every way.  Many of the gameplay conventions that Tribes pioneered have been recreated here.  The graphics are maybe not as sophisticated as Tribes:Ascend, but the gameplay is solid thus far right down to the map styles, character loadouts, weapon types and vehicles.Farming and deployables are back on the menu in Midair!"

,Recommended,439370,34852479,Posted: 9 September,all,Queso2469,Fun now. Can't wait for the map and UI polish work to be done. The Tribes I have been missing.
76561198012998880,Recommended,439370,34889335,Posted: 11 September,all,luvs2spooj,If you were a fan of Tribes 1 and 2 then you'll love this. The jetpack mechanics still need a little work and the gunfire reload feels a little slow but other than that fun game for being in closed beta. We do need some type of health pack or regen added but I'm sure thats probably on the way. Part of the fun capping back in the T1 and T2 days was disc launching yourself to get instant speed and then heal up before you get to the flag. The loadout screen is kinda a hot mess also but self explanitory. Guys look at T2 and follow that model. Keep it simple but sexy.  Game runs pretty smoothly considering my video card shouldn't be able to run it by the minimum specs.My PC specs-i7 2600 CPU @ 3.4GHZ8GB RamAMD 6700 GPU
,Recommended,439370,34523858,Posted: 27 August,all,3HavoC,Buy this game if you loved Tribes 1 and Tribes 2 not that abortion Tribes:♥♥♥♥♥end.  This game is done by Fan boys who know what makes a good Tribes games and are working to deliver that to us.
76561198015037756,Not Recommended,439370,34494956,Posted: 25 August,all,Dragoon,"Wouldn't recommend right now. The gameplay is just okay. Skiing is slow and combat is worse than T:A. I'd hold off until they polish this more. Not sure how you mess up on tribes harder than hirez. Can have some fun moments but a lot of core issues. Worth at 9.99, not 29.99. Feels and plays like a proof of concept.If you liked tribes but hirez♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you off with their decisions, I can't recommend this to replace it. Rather disappointing but its still early access so maybe they'll improve it a lot."
76561197982345110,Not Recommended,439370,34706851,Posted: 3 September,all,Lioncash,"Game is actually good and has MASSIVE potential however at this stage there are many features that feel quite unfinished.The flight mechanisms are MUCH less responsive than Tribes or Tribes Ascend. For example, it's incredibly difficult to jet pack vertically upward to get from one floor of the base to another. The cat and mouse like action feels gone and dead and is instead replaced by extreme vulnerability. Needs to be some serious tweaking with the base movement controls. Right now light classes feel like you're playing heavy classes. It's almost impossible to get off the ground without using terrain to do so. Like getting on top of my base feels like a movement chore.You have to change loadouts manually which is a massive annoyance too and don't understand why it was released in this way. Let us pick loadouts and stay with that as a CHOICE not a manual load nightmare..This removes playtime from players, like adding 20 seconds to a respawn timer for no reasonServers are mostly dead but people can help improve that. Although I'm marking don't recommend at this point, I 'm sure in the coming months the game will grow."
,Not Recommended,439370,34661877,Posted: 1 September,all,LoveTrooper,The movement is not right..All most all there maps lack good game play...with no anti cheat in place they are asking for player's to hack there game... Iv played tribes 1. Tribes 2 as a pro in TWL on a top Team...They need to build on the team work...It's in Beta so we will see where this go's
,Not Recommended,439370,34502074,Posted: 26 August,all,Rfl,"So yeah, this is kinda like Tribes 2. Unfortunately the developers decided to make this early access and the price point at 30€. Essentially this game is dead already. It's prime time EU and there is one full server with no queue option. So you can decide to play on a 3-people server and be bored out of your mind or hit refresh. This is during prime time mind you, in EU no less.So yeah. Don't buy this. Hopefully it can recover from this mistake when it goes free2play but right now you essentially pay 30 bucks to not play cause there is barely anybody there. Gameplay is fine I guess? Who knows. Hard to really try it out when there is barely anybody to play with."
76561197998939992,Recommended,439370,34650197,Posted: 31 August,all,Grey,Ex T2 player here. I really enjoy the movement. I've been waiting for a long time for a game to give me that same sensation that i got from Tribes. I missed skiing so much. Looking forward to see whatelse they add to the game.
76561197961698242,Recommended,439370,34684263,Posted: 2 September,all,hogslammer,"remember Tribes, Tribes:Ascend, Tribes:Vengence?  yay its back under the UNREAL engine this time baby !  yeaaaa! :)  alpha is alpha and its real early stage.  playable definatly, unless you are a tribes fan i dont see anyone really wanting this in alpha state.  if you love jetpacks, skiing slopes, cap the flag, or other typical game modes this one has it.  the voice system to communicate is so funny when they combine several phrases close together.  its so fun to me.  i hope to see more people pay up to help the devs build this to be the BEST tribes game ever, with great fluid performance and great graphics. Right now the maps and graphics are cartoony and basic sorta like TF2 from Valve. no ingame voice i think they use a discord server atm.  there isnt but usually 1 fullish server out of 30 or so listed atm.  if you see nobody playing, trust me, if you just join an empty server, some people will join and it grows in population.  im trying to dedicate at least an hour a day to sit on server and play."
,Recommended,439370,34618839,Posted: 30 August,all,Dr. Strangelove,It's like tribes but in early access and with t2 movement which quite frankly is quite different from ascend and I'm bad at it but.game does not suck.
76561198130324665,Recommended,439370,35247976,Posted: 27 September,all,mysteriumtremendom,"this game is very fun.  i kinda quit gaming for a few months until this game came out.  now I jump on at night when there is a pub going in my region.  to everyone saying that there are no players in the game, you need to get on at peak times right now and you can also go in the pug irc channel.  the vets may berate you for your criminal faults, but there is hope yet. we must persevere if we wish to move forward and prosper."
