,Recommended,439490,25999707,"Posted: 12 October, 2016",all,Miku,"Blue Revolver is straight up one of the best shmups on Steam. It's one of the few that's actually worth buying and playing on the platform. For reference, the other games I include are Mushihimesama and Crimzon Clover.This game also embraces the computer moreso than the minimum usually offered by its Japanese doujin counterparts. There's options for hitboxes and debug info and a colorblind mode. The resolution can be changed and there's a borderless window mode. Keybindings can be changed too. In the couple of hours I have spent so far with this game, I have had a positive experience that was the oppposite of the janky Mushihimesama port.The training mode options (named Stage Select in this game) are also a pheltora of delightful variables on par with the very best shmup ports. The game's rank system (difficulty increase or decrease depending on your gameplay) can be adjusted to various levels and even be frozen. The most helpful function, being able to start at any midboss or boss in the game, is thankfully available.Blue Revolver, while being a lovingly well-crafted in its game design, can also be brutally unforgiving to new players. A great addition, not only to this game but the shmup genre as a whole, is the Missions mode that sets goals for the player to meet in its scenarios that not only provides a challenge, but also teaches good fundamentals. The mode provides a great alternative to practice other than the norm of playing the main campaign or Stage Select modes over and over.Besides the game modes, there's the main game itself. Upon starting the game, there are two pilots, Mae and Val, to choose from, each with their own shot styles and secondary weapons. Next, there are the three difficulty options that greet the player: a Normal mode that keeps the difficulty down for novice players, a Hyper mode that is the standard game with the difficulty adjusting rank, and a Parallel mode that freezes the rank at its most hardest. After that, there are the three shot styles to select, which themselves are minorly adjusted by which pilot is chosen: narrow, wide, and follow (options that are adjusted by player movement). Finally, there's the secondary weapon choice which, depending on the pilot, can be missiles, an arc blaster, the DoDonpachi laser, something like the Dangun Feveron charge shot, a Mars Matrix-like reflect shot, and cluster missiles.After all that, the game starts off with an homage to the first stage of DoDonPachi. There are many elements of the familiar, but they transcend beyond just a mere tribute into a tightly designed game that can stand among the greats of the shmup genre. The game system is a pastiche of great shmups. The scoring system is about increasing the combo counter to its maximum of 8 by defeating enemies in quick succession, which then unlocks the highest score multiplier to be doled out by then defeating enemies with the secondary weapon. The combo timeout clocks down to 0 and the cycle begins anew. Using the secondary weapon before the combo counter reaches 8 then locks the number, kinda like not getting close enough in Ketsui, and can only be reset by letting the combo timeout. Unlike their source inspiration from DoDonpachi, combos aren't an unforgiving game-long affair to maintain, incentivising the player to be free-form in their scoring rather than being locked into a superplay perfect route throughout the stages. Bombing and death aren't bad either because the former gives more ammo for the secondary weapons and death lowers the rank and adds to the bomb meter.Inspiration from Raizing games can also be seen. The screen being covered in satisfying x64 texts is something like hitting the maximum score multiplier in Battle Bakraid. Since the combo timeout will always expire, there isn't the sense of keeping the multiplier going for as long as possible like is often seen in Raizing games. The result is a scoring system that is easy to get into for novices and aren't outright restarts on screwups for pros. It is more about being aware of scoring opportunities and doing your best to exploit them. There are also Breaks and their scoring bonuses that are given out to players that defeat certain enemies in a particular difficult manner kinda like milking bosses or hidden ""objectives"" in Battle Garegga. This all culminates into Blue Revolver being simply one of the best scoring systems in all of shmups. I don't think it'll knock off Espgaluda 2's position for the best in my book, but it is very high up there next to it.Now that I mention Espgaluda 2, there is something akin to its tandem between survival and scoring. Blue Revolver has secondary weapons that offer greater survivability than scoring opportunities like the Dangun Feveron-like charge shot that absorbs enemy bullets or the Mars Matrix-like reflect shot that shoots enemy bullets back. These probably can lead to easier clears, but aren't that great for scoring. However, there is also a benefit to scoring other than a highscore: extends. While scoring can increase rank more, extends provide a light at the end of the bullet hell tunnel. Blue Revolver offers 4 extends that give an extra life, which can be used to replenish lives lost to keep the rank low. The extra lives gained from scoring can help carry the player forward in a way that solely focusing on survival can't. This is something like Battle Garegga where you continually score and suicide, but this style of play isn't mandated to actually clear the game and is just an alternative route through. It is possible to beat the game on the hardest rank as there is a difficulty mode that is just that.The bullet patterns aren't just for show in this game. They are deliberately designed to stress you, the player, out in different ways. You will continually be kept on your toes, making for an intense, frantic game. Enemies will get into your face to pelt you with a swarm of bullets. Linear shots will be sent straight down the screen. Aimed shots will fly at you. A shotgun pattern of bullets will march towards you in formation. There's barely a safe spot and you will resort to all sorts of tactics to dodge the enemy bullets and stay alive, flying all over the screen. And the bullets just keep coming with barely a breath of rest.Some of the enemies in this game are somewhat tanky, but that's to incentivise the use of your secondary weapon. You will be driven to proactively attack them and take them out before they become a threat if you aren't confident in your dodging abilities. However, this can take away from your scoring potential as for example, some enemies' Breaks occur when they are kept alive for a certain period of time. This is another clever use of how secondary weapons can be used either for survival or scoring. The bullet patterns of the game's bosses are also tough, but they can be taken down quickly with the secondary weapons kinda like using the Hadou Cannon in Ibara, sacrificing scoring opportunities for survival.Aside from all the same situations and multiple approaches available in the game design, there are numerous unlockables present. Continues are disabled from the start in order to encourage the proper mindset of trying to complete the game in one credit, but they can be unlocked after accuring a significant amount of the in-game currency. There are also numerous wallpapers and alternative color palettes for the player and remixed soundtracks available.All in all, this is a damn good game. It's tightly designed in a very intelligent way and gives a great variety of fun and challenge. Probably the only real flaw that can be found in this game is that it's brutal for beginners. Nonetheless, I think that any beginner willing to learn this game will find great tools to get them up and running as opposed to any other difficult shmups in the genre. I'm sure the pros already find this game a joy to play around with and master."

,Recommended,439490,25994166,"Posted: 12 October, 2016",all,PrinceFroggy,"Blue Revolver is my new danmakuwaifuVery nice surprise as I didn't expect it to be this good.Gameplay1. IntroductionGameplay is simple but satisfying and gives room from playing survival or scoring. Difficulty has 3 different modes : easy, rank dependant and maxed rank. I'm far from being a good shmup player but I think it has enough options to be satisfying for the complete newcommer to the genre as much as for the veteran player.2. Character, ship, and weapon selectionYou choose one of the two waifubots and their ships, then you choose the type of mainshot direction (straight, wide, directionnal) in a fashion very similar to the most recent DoDonpachi episodes. Eventually you chose your ""special"" weapon (4 different types, with some exclusive to one or the other ship).3. Game mechanicsScoring system is very straight forward, you build up your chain meter up to 8 with your normal shot by destroying enemy. Then you fire your special weapon to kill enemies for a score multiplier based on your chain counter. Your chain counter starts depleting when you fire the first time your special, and there is no way to rebuild it but to wait till it reaches zero.The special weapon uses ammo that you refill by collecting items left behind by killed enemies. Bombs work in a similar fashion, do bullet cancel, and give you a temporary invincibility.Design1. IntroductionMusic and art style while subjective are imo awesome.Unlike a lot of the recently released ""indie pixel art shmups"" that are beautiful but have no thought put into game design, Blue Revolver is on par with ""professional"" shmups.2. Game designLevels are pretty diverse, and bullet patterns can be quiet challenging and impressive, especially on rank5. Thoughts has been put behind enemies and bullets coloring as the action never gets unreadable like it happens so often with indie shmups.3.""It feels like home""The game gives tributes to many classics of the genre in a lot of ways, it shows and feels that it was developped with love by entusiats of this niche genre, and not created to ride on a trend or because""Let's make a shmup guys, it's so simple to do"".In summaryI rate it a""Get it now""out of""What's a shmup?"".."

It is a solid game: 3 difficulty modes, alternate weapon choices (also, 2 characters), 5 stages/bosses with additional mid-bosses, an accessible scoring system (+ leaderboards/replays, and mini-challenges called ""missions"").The game is also good on the aesthetics side, with cute, flashy pixel art graphics and nice music.Last but not least, it is a good bargain (15€ at full price).PS. if you would rather have a taste before biting, a demo of an old build is freely available on the game's official website"

,Recommended,439490,26072872,"Posted: 16 October, 2016",all,aim for the top,"If you like shmups, buy this game. If you don't, this is an excellent introduction. It's not 1993 anymore so you get adjustable difficulty modes, a mess of different ships and weapons to play with, stage select right away, and a bunch of tutorial/challenge missions. It looks good and sounds good and feels good to just dodge around blowing stuff up to get points (BLUE REVOLVER respects the deep-seated gamer urge to collect gold cubes).Veterans will recognize echoes of older games - there's a little Dodopachi, a little Garegga, a little Mars Matrix... but rather than a rehash it's the feeling of someone who is steeped in these games and came out with something new. The scoring system is more approachable and more fun than the punishing chain systems of yesteryear. The Break system combines the best parts of having weird secret stuff (like Garegga's flamingoes) with mid-level optional challenges (like getting the stage 3 1up in Dodonpachi). You get to duel a dang jet with vulcan cannons."
,Recommended,439490,33063083,Posted: 30 June,all,Aleth,"This game is friggin' amazing. The scoring system is kinda easy to understand but hard to really master since you have to max out your multiplier and be sure that you have enough ammo to explode a large ships pack. So yeah, you can practice with it at any time, but there will be key moments when scoring will be at hands.Normal mode starts easy but Stage 5 is a pain in the butt. Also, Normal mode has auto-bomb when you die, but it consumes every bomb you have on this life. So you'll prefer going manual and push dat bomb button when you feel like you'll waste a life.Hyper mode is really interesting because the game becomes harder each time you pass a level. And Parallel mode is extreme mode, you'll start with a full difficulty setting.Missions are really cool and they help you understanding gameplay mechanics like Breaks, Flourish etc. Plus, it gives you stars to spend in the shop as a reward.The OST is totally awesome, and the remixes too. You can switch to whatever version of music you want per stage (if you like original, remixes etc).Art direction is pixel art but it's done right. There's enough detail to recognize a level, and not too complex in order for you to actually read what's happening on the screen.Seriously, this is one of my favourite Bullet Hell. And I played a lot."
,Recommended,439490,25999112,"Posted: 12 October, 2016",all,Liesmith,"This game is an absolute gem. You can really see the love that went into making it, in the art, the music, and especially the incredibly tight mechanics. The score system is really intuitive and fun (rack up an eight kill streak, then fire your special weapon for a 'flourish' and watch points roll in), the movement is fluid and the bullet patterns are challenging but fair. When I die, and I've died a lot, it's never frustrating because it's always clear to me what i did wrong and how I messed up. The exuberance of the VA yelling ""game over!"" also helps. Shes just so psyched to see me dead that I can't be mad.the variety of weapons and setups is really cool, i've spent a good amount of time fooling around with different arrangements and characters. There are two characters, each of whom has similar (but not identical) main attacks, but a range of powerful special moves that are mostly unique to them. Some special moves are defensive, some spray missiles across the screen, while others are just a single powerful missile that fires straight ahead or a mega-laser that wipes out everything in your way. You get to pick a single special gun for each run and it really changes up how I play.I'm disastrously bad at the game, but it's got an easy mode (normal) that I'm struggling though and every run is a blast. I've also played a fair amount of Hyper mode, where i am ashamed to say I can't even beat the second boss. Hyper mode is the default difficulty, and is a very clever difficulty level that adapts to how well you are doing: die a bunch and it's indistinguishable from normal mode, but rack up a bunch of great combos and flourishes, and the next thing you know you're in full on hard mode. speaking of which, the hard mode (called parallel) starts you at the max-combo difficulty right off the bat, and I'm sure it's more than enough to satisfy actual shmup players.I really like this game and i hope to someday not suck at it. I recommend it to anyone who likes videogames."

Unlike a lot of other SHMUPS, this is very easy to understand and is a blast to play; Chain to 8, and cash it in for sweet multipliers!Other than that, it's just a damn fine game. Super slick, fast, and relentless.Pros- Great scoring system- Good variety of ships; choose how you want to blast dudes!- Amazing OST- Entertaining amount of unlockable songs, alternate sprites, and backdrops- Accessible difficulty settings (with an interesting scaling system if you so desire).- FANTASTIC options. Being able to change colours and see hitboxes is A+Cons- Ship explosions and bullets sound a little flat.- Some bullet patterns feel a tad too random (note: I probably just need to git gud)- Achievements and replays are not yet implemented at time of writing.TL:DR It's one of the BEST indie SHMUPS in recent times.

,Recommended,439490,32841177,Posted: 26 June,all,bigturd,"im pretty bad at shmups but this game is really accomadating for noobs with its mission mode, and the amount of content is almost staggering. being a relative newbie at bullet hell games (i 1cc'd novice mode on crimzon clover and thats about it) i guess i can't really comment on the intricacies of the scoring system and different weapons, but everything feels really solid and releases enough chemicals in my brain to allow me to play at hours on end. buy it, ♥♥♥♥er{150 credits have been deposited into your badgame account}UPDATE 1: with a little more danmaku (google it baka...) experience i can say that blue revolver is indeed a fine example of the genre, i like the scoring system in particular because its easy to understand but still allows for a lot of depth and experimentation, and its nice not having to pull up a damn 30 page pdf file every time i come back to the game just to remember the basics of scoring. there's also a fair amount of customization which really adds to the replayability. only thing i'm kinda iffy on is the dynamic difficulty, thats just kind of a gripe with the concept itself though. i'd rather have a more consistent experience than having the difficulty change based on my performance. on the other hand, i didn't even realize the difficulty scaled until it was pointed out, so it feels cheap to complain about it. but yeah blue revolver is really really good, $15 is a solid price for the amount of content you get, and every piece meshes together to create the addictive shmup experience we all know and love."
76561197990672230,Recommended,439490,26145104,"Posted: 21 October, 2016",all,NineByNine,"I'm terrible at Shmups just in general. I cannot quite be enough ATTITUDE for sufficient GAINS, I get the concept of SHOOT THE CORE but can't quite capitalise on it. I find NO REFUGE when I need it most. Every time I play one it's like I'm being attacked by the FULLEST EXTENT OF THE JAM.Shmup memes aside, this is an unrelentingly challenging shmup game. It has a Novice mode (and the fact I can't get further than the boss of level 3 even on that mode should tell you how bad I am at these games), called ""Normal"" difficulty, where the first hit you take activates a bomb instead to give you a brief period of invulnerability. Hyper mode is the game's ACTUAL Normal difficulty and plays like a standard Shmup, though by all accounts the difficulty is dynamic, and the better you do, the harder the difficulty gets. On the other hand, Parallel mode locks the game's difficulty to the max level, to give the biggest challenge. Personally, I feel both Hyper and Normal modes are challenging enough as it is.You also get two choices of character and ship; Mae in her Mapleberry, and Val in her Urashima or ... I forget what it's called ,but something like that. They have slightly different behaviours and weapons it seems, and definately different appearances, but functionally the game plays out the same... THough the story seems quite different depending upon which character you choose.Speaking of story, holy hell, what a cool concept! Magic that is controlled like programming code, but can build up junk data which causes anomalies in reality? Teams of ""Technicians"" that deal with Junk Data and make sure 'code' is clean and efficient to minimise appearance of junk data? Devices which help them do that? a supergroup of Technicians called Blue Revolver with mysteriously super powerful Devices? and a strange, super anomaly they investigate with readings eerily similar to their Devices?? All of my yes.Couple this with an astounding, pulse pounding soundtrack, cute character designs, beautiful graphics and a Missions system which actually is meant to be a tutorial of sorts to teach you how to play STGs (good lord I can't believe I only just found that out myself), and you pretty much have yourself a winner!It seems to lack a multiplayer mode from what I've seen, which is slightly saddening, and if you die, you gotta restart at the beginning until you amass the 4500 star points to unlock free play mode, but considering in the short time I've played it I've amassed like 2200? I'm not far off already... There's other unlocks too, like remixes of tracks, background arts, concept arts and whatnots, so that's great too :DThis game is packed solid with features and wonderfulness, and it was absolutely worth all the wait and the pricetag.

Challenging for both beginner and psychos alike. The powerful soundtrack and mesmerising artwork give this game a polish and sheen usually reserved for larger budget projects, and with a novel, deep scoring system there is plenty of scope for replayability.As someone who never really played many shmups, the genre can be a daunting experiance. Blue Revolver looked daunting at first, but once you play a few minutes (and die a few times!) and you start to get a feel for the game, it grabs you.I started playing this game with high expectations, and they were exceeded with every play. Whilst at times infurating and punishing, I never felt the game was being unfair. Every time I died, I realised my faults, picked myself up and tried again.Learning the game, and learning from the game, is an organic experiance with Blue Revolver. You complete that first stage and you feel confident. Then you hit stage 2 and you are humbled. You say to yourself ""Ok, its time to think more about positioning myself correctly so that doesn't happen again"" and you start to pay attention to patterns and enemy types a lot more. You hold onto that special weapon for big guys, but soon you get confident enough to say ""I can kill that sucker! I want more x64s not x2s!"". With every new stage comes a deeper challenge, and the game yearns for you to polish your craft before you can truely take on the next level.

Although I doubt these in-game graphics would've been up to the standard of the major arcade game companies of the day. The game uses an unusual abstract style where many of the enemies appear to be rather box like, although some resemble things like aircraft or tanks. Although I suppose there's nothing really wrong with them it's kinda hard to get exited about killing a box.Aside from that, the manga style cutscene and background graphics are excellent. And there's a few backgrounds, music remixes and player skins to be unlocked, as well as ""Free Play"" mode, which allows you to continue after losing all your lives.  This last one is the only one that affects gameplay in any way, and the only one I felt particularly exited about unlocking.Variable difficulty adjusts itself to the players performance, with three basic modes to keep the difficulty within a certain range. Although I find I tend to get about as far through on the medium setting as I do on the lower setting, only my score is much higher.No weapon upgrades, although there is a choice of weapons at the start, suiting a variety of play styles. And three kinds of in game weaponry. There is a primary weapon, with unlimited power, which can be fired in rapid or concentrated mode. A secondary weapon which uses up power, each of the two characters has three to choose from with a variety of effects. I usually go for the most powerful one. The power of the secondary weapon is multiplied when you kill lots of enemies in quick succession. And finally a bomb/shield/energy drop, which will auto-activate if you get hit on the easiest setting, saving your life, but costing you all your bombs which you were saving for the boss.Overall I'd have to say this is a fun, challenging (I've only made it to level 4/5 on normal) game.8.8/10(I haven't tried it on a vertical monitor, but I'd say add +0.2 if you have one)"
,Recommended,439490,26019818,"Posted: 13 October, 2016",all,Starlogical★,"Be wary though, the game does NOT come with Free Play out of the box, you'll have to unlock it and depending on your skill and how far you can get in a single continue, it could be quite the grind before you unlock it.It's a quality shmup and yet another one worth buying. Scoring system is unique and while memorization of levels takes you far, it's no longer the only way to reach a high score worth tweeting (get this, the game lets you upload your scores on twitter).2 characters, 3 shot styles per character, 4 specials weapons per character. 24 different ways to play.3 difficulties that manipulate the ingame difficulty scaling system.Unlockable art, song remixes and color palletes with ingame stars you get per play.It's worth the money 10/10.The soundtrack is amazing and I ought to buy it. If someone wants to gift me it that'd be great too."

This game is great for beginner's, as I had played, touhou, etc., but it is a great starter for people to play or be in♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed into these type of genres. This also helps and gives also a great amount of fun for veterans and experts at these games, and WILL certainly enjoy the asthetics of this game. Gameplay is very fluid, even though I am one off of the processing power, replay value is very high on this game, and the help and tips of different modes help any player get addicted. Even when i unlocked free play mode, exactly what it sounds like, I took it off because i wanted to become better at the game. It wasn't because of a few hours to get mehyped, but because it gives you the mindset to get better and enhance your skills in the game. The gallery art is beautiful and the unlocks are really cool. The missions are also great, as they give challenges to improve, survivability, scoring, etc. and also stage select as it helps to practice a certain level that you are stuck on. Though some things that are not well is the lack of content, even if it is an arcade like game. I kind of wish there was more things to play at, like new levels and such, but don't get me wrong. This game makes me play almost a lot of hours into it. I hope they put out DLC for this game and change a few things, but this is something that i will put in a lot of time.Overall: 4.85 on my list (just because of some bugs and the need for more content)"

With a little experimentation I was able to figure it out and I had no problems afterwords.While all of the special weapons are expained when you select them the difference between the 2 ships is not and you have to figure that out for youself.In general Blue Revolver will not hold your hand all that much but it is a very fun and satisfying experience. If you've ever thought about giving a shoot em up a try, Blue Revolver is a good choice. Would recommend."

Its easy for players new to the genre to get a grasp on the game, while difficult enough so that adept players can also enjoy the game's 5 stages. Blue Revelover is simplifed to be sure; however, Blue Revolver still succeeds in providing excellent gameplay and thrilling moments. The art style and OST also help give personality to the game.The game's one weakness would be it's sometimes confusing visual cues. Points earned from killing enemies sometimes blocks the screen, hiding bullets. Additionally, besides a short and ineffective tutorial, the game simply leaves newcomers into the genre clueless as to what bars and numbers represent.But who cares?!? These are minor information problems that are solved within the first few games anyway. Blue Revolver is still an amazing and addictive game that focused on delivering excellent gameplay though the renfinement of core mechanics. It steps back from the complexities of many bullet hell games, and returns to a simpler times, while retaining the difficultly and excitement of much more complex bullet hells. Its easily of the best shmups on steam. In short:Buy Blue Revolver. Now."
