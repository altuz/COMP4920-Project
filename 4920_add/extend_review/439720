,Not Recommended,439720,21384653,"Posted: 22 February, 2016",all,Warlord Mal,"Unending Galaxy promises real time 4X with a cool twist - build up from one ship, to a mighty galactic spanning empire.However, the details of executing this promise are frustrating to accomplish - all from a lack of information given to the player to the lull of getting from one ship to an empire.The game has some great stuff in it from the X universe, which the creator is a modder of. The good stuff is : the ability to make ships auto-trade and auto-mine asteroids to start building you a nest-egg for your future empire. Getting this is no problem at all and is very nicely done.The combat however is very break-neck speed in my opinion. Big ships that cost quite a bit of money can die if you dont immediately start evasive maneuvers to get out of combat and kite enemies...that is unless you grossly outnumber the enemy, which can take a bit of time, even for small pirate factions.Couple this with the fact that the game never tells you what weapons do differently than each other(even trying to guess visually is very rough), the one dimensional defense modules that just add shields: which all seem to get blown away with very little effort...and this makes managing a small combat fleet disappointing.Building an empire is fun in this game. You get to build a lot of trade infrastracture that spans the entirety of a galaxy. But the lack of information on which ships have enough cargo room to build can set the player back at least 10-20 minutes of game time if they do not guess right. On top of this, there is a big system of infrastructure required to get ship parts and supply. which is also not that well explained in the game. This really stops you from enjoying the fun nature of this game for another couple of hours.Overall, this game has potential to be a very fun 2D , real time 4X, that gives us what we want - adventures in a big galaxy on a small scale that lead to massive galactic warfare in the end. But getting to the end is a big pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and is just not as fun as it sounds when you see what is happening in the game and know what it takes to get there."

Another issue is the UI takes some time to get the hang of, and finally the game lacks clarity on a lot of its mechanics which forced me to test a lot of stuff to figure out how exactly some of the game worked but...Putting those issues aside I love this game, I absolutely love it.It's a large 4X RTS where you can play as a single ship or up to an entire empire. You can scavage battlefields for parts, you can hunt bounties, you can be a trader, you can claim territory, colonize planets, be a pirate, bring down empires, build them, create a space industry of your choice with factories ranging from farms to computers, to fire arms, fight rogue AI or space monsters, and a lot more.You are placed in a simulated galaxy and then told to do whatever you want, that's what Unending Galaxy is, and it will likely become one of my new favorite games.As for the dev they seem great, I've asked a few questions and put a few issues on the forum already and the dev was just about the first person to answer all of them, even more so he's already making changes in the next patch based on a couple issues I had, rare to have that kind of on-point activity."
,Recommended,439720,22082953,"Posted: 27 March, 2016",all,Luminaire,"This little game actually surprised me.. Quite a bit so.. It's very simple, yet complex enough to be fulfilling. It has done an excellent job of finally satisfying that craving for a simple space empire/fleet building game.There are a few things that I feel could have been done better, and i'll cover those second.. But first, onto the positives!1- Simple and effecient!This is where this game surprised me. I am really impressed with the control and management given to the players in this form. Want to play rpg style with a single ship as your own? Or have a small fleet of escorts? You can do that. Want to play rts style where you tell a few ships, or large quantities of ships to perform specific actions? You can do that too. Want to just sit back, and stare at a spreadsheet and operate your vastly growing empire without directly controlling any ships? You can do that too, All the while not being hassled to mine/farm repetatively for 20 hours before you start your own empire. You can do that right off the bat. Additionally, while you do have control over your own faction ships and structures, civillian activity is present aswell. The structures you build will automatically spawn civillian ships which will act like free-willed npcs to participate in the growth of your empire. Whether that be mining, trading, or even bounty hunting. You do not need to manage them on your own, and there is no loss when they get their little pea shooter box-car bounty-hunter blown up by a dreadnaught pirate.Unending Galaxy has managed to mash all this together in one simple and efficient design where one method of play does not clash with another, all in the same game session. Nor are you required to do one over the other. The controls are simple and straightforward enough, without the hassle of selecting gamemodes or setting things up. Simply generate your world, and off you go.The AI works. You can assign different roles and goals for all your ships individually, or in groups, and the optional automation is self-sufficient.Now. There is one thing need to be aware of though, and that is the graphics. While this does not hold a huge impact on my judgement for this game (as i've all but been able to see past it all), the game does not use original assets, and the most beautiful visuals are the planets. (Like, really beautiful!).. Some assets are open source assets, which included a ship i used to make my first mod in Endless Sky (That was amusing to see!)One final note, is that when I first got this game, I was not able to launch it. I was having issues that was ultimately determined to be my AV.. But before that was figured out, the dev was very helpful in trying to get my issue resolved, and even offered that if my attempts to make the game work went past the refund policy for steam, he would send them an exception to allow me to refund it. I'm glad that it was not necessary, as I've had a lot of enjoyment with this game."

As other reviewers have stated there are some notable issues with the game play and very little info on how things work in the beginning (very trial-and-error learning), but even with those shortcomings I have found it to be fun and interesting. I am also pleased to find that the developer is active in the forums and plans on continuing to improve it.If you're willing to self-dig a little into the mechanics, I would definitely recommend this game :)"

But, its not good either.There are very few ship classes, races usually fight late game with fleets of 5-15 ships apiece, the ships feel like paper, there is little variety in weapons, no way to upgrade armor or thrusters (that I know of), maps are kind of bland, there is no way to join an existing faction, growing your own faction is very tedious, etc. Tbh I could go on about the ""almost bad"", but let's get the good:Very very close to the X3 games (think terran conflict 2d), sprites are very lovely (I realize he didn't make most of them, but that should not be an issue ever imho, if a sprite pack is open to use and it fits your style you want then why not use them?), weapon and shield effects are pretty solid, I enjoy the sound (everything), and tbh I feel like that sums up all my good feelings.....To restate before THIS GAME IS NOT BAD, its just not good... And since there is no meh option, I am afraid I will give the thumbs down :/. Hopefully later down the line we will see an expanding to the base game in form of new ships, bigger battles, and less super fast paced combat. If that day comes I will more than happily give this game a thumbs up instead.PLEASE NOTE:All of my reviews are MY OPINION, I base my reviews off my own play experience and how I feel the game relates to me personally. I am not a professional reviewer and my reviews should never be looked at as the only factor for buying a game, if you see a negative or positive review of mine on a game then please go watch gameplay or read at least 5 more reviews so you can get a general idea for what the game is."
,Recommended,439720,31275391,Posted: 21 April,all,Mattk50,"I ""aquired"" this game first, then liked it enough to buy it even though i didnt think it would get more updates. And it is getting more updates.The simulation aspect and vairance of scale of the gameplay(you can be a solo pirate, or run a huge empire) is impressive, there are a lot of honestly quite trashy games like SPAZ that just throw completely independent systems at you and expect you to grind through them with each one being the same and having no interaction. This game while lacking polish has that element of a real world to it, and while neither it's basic gameplay or simulation is perfect, it entertained me for many hours."
,Recommended,439720,21418382,"Posted: 23 February, 2016",all,Dbrn,"This game reminds me a lot of how the X series games play along with some Distant Worlds and some top down space shooter added in.  It doesn't have cutting edge 3D graphics, but the aesthetic still feels great, the art is smooth yet crisp.  While it does use a lot of the ship assets from AI War, they still manage to feel fresh and don't detract from the value of the game at all.From starting with a full empire to play it as a 4X strategy game, to starting with a small fleet or even a single ship to make it feel more like a sim, there is something here for you if you enjoy these types of games. There are 11 Starting Scenarios, 7 total handcrafted non-tutorial maps, a procedural map generator and a faction customizer which ends up offering a lot of replayability.  You can have a small knife fight galaxy or a huge 1800+ sector sandbox universe plus many other variable to fine tune how you want the universe to ultimately run.I feel the music is standard for a small indie studio and I feel the sound effects could be better, but neither really detract from the gameplay and they are satisfactory.  Not too much to suggest here as I know how expensive these assets can be to acquire if you want superb and unique non-library music/effects.To me, the game is great, I've had quite a bit of fun just trying out different starts and seeing what the gameplay has to offer both on the 4X end and the sim end.  At the basic level, it's very much trade, fight, build, think with the opportunity to play it as a nearly full featured 4X.  I say nearly because obviously some things are missing, like a researchable tech tree.  Your tech is actually pre-determined while setting up the game.  I do not feel that this takes away from the experience whatsoever, but it could for you if you prefer the traditional research trees.One of the great aspects of the game is, like Distant Worlds, you can automate a lot of tasks and though it does not reach the level of Distant Worlds, it's not as complicated as that game either so it does not need as much.  For me, it is the right amount.  If you don't like all that automation, you can of course control everything yourself, you can even create control groups and play it as a typical RTS, right clicking your attack groups to wherever you like.The biggest common complaint that I see popping up is the depth of the tutorial.  While for me personally, I felt it was fine and was able to easily figure out whatever was not answered in the tutorial simply by playing, I do understand that this is an issue for those not used to this type of gameplay.  It's important to note that this is on the list of things to fix along with the other issues.Aside from the readability of the text font on my screen (which I have been able to work around thanks to some help), I do not have any big complaints about this game that would warrant a thumbs down.  In fact, quite the opposite as you can see.  The sheer fun of the game, the option to play it in different ways, the helpfulness of the developer, and the price (a steal in my opinion), this is a fine entry to the 4X Strategy/Space-Sim market."
,Recommended,439720,33537625,Posted: 14 July,all,Tyr,"It's a great game, It's similar to X3 but 2d when it comes to the empire management etc.Ships can be automated without special software packages so in that sense it's a bit simpler but that plays out well for the design of the game. It's significantly complicated enough with managing your ships, trade etc.I definitely recommend it. It gives you a more direct experience for a 4x game. There's a learning curve but stick with it and you'll enjoy building up your empire, managing your supply lines etc."

This is mainly due to the developer being a serious X3 modder - he brought in all sorts of fancy empire management options and automation that is common in the X games.-sophisticated mechanics that allow for deep gameplay-variety of ways to play. you don't have to build an empire or colonize worlds, you can make plenty of money and get huge fleets going just by trading, mining, hunting bounties, and pirating.-game explodes in complexity once you finally colonize a planet and get around to building industry infrastructure (for some this is a con, but if so, you're playing the wrong game bruh)-game graphics are simple, 2d sprites, but this actually helps in terms of being able to clearly identify what is happening on the screen-so many different maps, scenario starts, and game world customization options, that you could tool around with the diffenret starting options forever.-Race/faction ships all play and feel genuinely differnet, races have well-established strengths and weaknesses.Cons:-UI is sometimes difficult to parse, there is a LOT information to be juggling in your head all at the same time, and those who aren't veterans of the X games or of large-scale 4x/real-time strategy games in general are going to feel overwhelmed.-selecting ships and giving orders is much harder than it needs to be. too many menus to go through in order to give simple instructions. Dev has acknowledged some of this criticism and is actively working on parsing menus and generally improving the UI.-it's not entirely clear what strengths and weaknesses certain weapons have, and which weapons might be more effective for certain situations.-combat is simply too fast - large battleships can be reduced to cinders in seconds by a well-coordinated swarm. ships movement as well, is gnereally speaking very very quick given the size of the individual sectors - if the sectors in space were larger, the speed would be fine, but as it is, you traverse sectors and die in combat entirely too quickly. if you really want to keep your ships alive, you'll have to engage primarily in small-scale maneuvers and take personal control of your battleships so you can get them out of harms way quickly-diplomacy is basically non-existent - this is the only place where the game really falls down, IMO. There are no real permanent alliances or trade options, everything is on a timer and will eventually run out. the ai has no real sense, it seems, of where it's fleets are at and what kind of force distribution is going on - generally speaking, when it's time to go to war, the ai throws everything it has at you (and each other) and whoever happens to win the first major engagement will then proceed to (more or less) steamroll the loser. beyond this, the ai is EXTREMELY aggressive. their only long-term interest is war, and when you are just beginning a game, attempting to colonize a planet and build up your empire, you can easily get smashed before you can even get off the ground.Most of the cons amount to simple fixes or adjustments in the way the game mechanics work. I'm confident that the dev will get things figured out.I would reccommend this game for anyone who liked the X games or large scale space 4x games with a real-time twist. now is an especially good time to buy, seeing as there was just a big content update as well as a superb graphical update which really improves the overal look and feel of the game."

The developer released an update 2/22/2016 around 1:30am EST, less than 12 hours after I posted this review. While the resolution scaling issues are not fixed, the update is a step in the right direction and I was able to get the game working at a lower resolution with the external config. I've decided to change my review and cancel the refund request. A developer that pays this much attention to their customers and can pump out a fix within 12 hours on a Sunday clearly cares about their customers, fans, and their game. Whether or not I end up enjoying the game, I'm willing to give my money to a developer like this.The UI is terrible. I didn't even play the game. I couldn't. The Start Game button was off-screen, unless I changed the resolution to 1024x768 on my 1080p screen. Tried changing to 1920x1080 fullscreen... and 50% of the game was off-screen. I couldn't even change it back to windowed mode because the check box for windowed mode was off-screen.I can't even speak about the game itself.

Second, I will be talking about the sound of the game, which is good but could use improvement. Third, I will be talking about the games Artificial intelligence, which is superb. Fourth, I will be talking about the games interface and how intuitive it is. Fifth, I will be talking about why I like the game and how it has a variety of play options available to the player. I recommend you buy this game it is a lot of fun!First, the games AESTHETICS are great. The backgrounds have a wide variety and are visually stimulating throughout the game. The aesthetics of the different races are also enjoyable showing a remarkable amount of variety that you do not see with other games. The preview doses a fairly good job of showing you what the game looks like, but if you are into building you can set up building patterns and the like.Second, the SOUND of music is beautiful, keep the adventure going, but there are some problems with ships firing noises. The game can get a bit buggy on firing sounds both in small and large encounters. Normally, one ship firing will take precedence over the others and sometimes firing sounds will not be heard at all.  However, there is never an issue with the music muffling firing sounds if they do work. However, the game is still being developed, so this could be fixed over time and never reduces or harms the game play experience, especially if fighting is not a focus of your game play.Third, the game's ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE system is just amazing in the game. The other factions play extremely well and your own ships operate according to the orders you give them with remarkable efficiency. The game lends itself to allowing multitasking by giving you the ability to order multiple ships to do things automatically. If you have any faction enemies they tend to respond very quickly, which makes decisions important.Fourth, the game's INTERFACE is really intuitive. I found myself learning, which menu I needed and when relatively quickly. This was extremely helpful in both setting up the artificial intelligence and playing the game in general. Being able to quickly go through tabs to find information was extremely useful and over time has become easier as patches have improved it since I started playing.Fifth, the game is FUN. Their are quite of ways to play the game and things to do and really you have a lot of options. You can build an empire, but that is not necessary for game play. You can play the entire game without ever owning a building and it wouldn't harm your play at all. How and what you do in the game are up to you. With an economic, military, and exploration focus. There are eggs in the game and there are more to come that I look forward to. There is also a very in depth weapons system, and quests for factions with real rewards and a multitude of ships to play with."

Then I set the game to run in Direct X 9 Legacy mode which helped a lot for me and I get barely any crashes at all.The good about the game is... if you can run it, its pretty fun. The price tag of 11,99 Euro atm is in my opinion set too high, since the game has still some serious crashes (can still not go to game settings from ingame and have to use the game settings out of game before starting the game to change things). Also the economy and number of ships is not nearly as complex as for example a X-series game (which the game creator is a modder of). I think the game still lacks a lot of content and it could need a more fleshed out economy. Also the battles are a lot too fast... sure there is a combat mod that makes some changes, so that combat is slower and more meaningful than just pewpew boom battleship gone, but I think the core game should also lean a lot more in such a direction, basically more away from that arcady feeling and more to a full-scale 4x where you have a slow build-up and your bases and economy has a bigger meaning. It would be also nice to do more with your own sectors when you have some... as far as it is atm you build stations into your sectors and thats pretty much it... I would like to have more defence structures, maybe even minefields and such... I would like to be able to customise the automated patrolships in my sector (amount and kind of and such) maybe that could be also imbued by adding for example a fleet headquarter for stronger patrols and fighter bases for more smaller patrols or something like that.All in all the game has a good idea behind it. The technical execution is not that good atm, it needs quite more polishing.  Also it needs a lot more base game content, sure the game is heavily modable and modders already did come up with smaller mods but to get more people into the game (and more bigger mods in the end) it would be good to lure in a bigger audience with more and of course more fleshed out content. What would also help to make the economy more meaningful... make ship building for the own faction and the AI more complex and as I said combat slower and more meaningful. Give players and AI more tools to protect their assets and add more content in general (would like a lot more ship types like corvettes, cruisers with different niches and something bigger than a battleship maybe to have as a flagship). Thats in my opinion what would help this game a lot and take it from ""oh a small nice game that I play for a few hours"" to ""WOW... and its also heavily modable... I am so gonna make a mod for it and play that game forever"".I know as a user its always kind of easy to point out the weaker parts of a game and say ""oh that needs more work"" and all. Still keep in mind this is a one man show and he is fixing as fast as possible and will add more content to it as far as I did read on the forums (and I believe him). The game will get there to be that masterpiece we all would like to have, but it still needs time and some deep balancing changes.So... why a positive review?If you want to help a dev in getting the game to a broader audience and dont mind the 11,99 Euro price tag you should jump in with both feet. If you have a lot of crashes and graphical odd behavior like me, try the Direct X9 legacy mode, helped me. Also I think you have to see this kind of game here as some kind of early access and not as finished triple A title.So If you have no problem to get a game thats not labeled Early Access but should be, then buy... help the dev make it bigger and better with your money, feedback and maybe even mods (as far as I did read he also needs more ship models and stations and such, if you have some or know how to make some, maybe contact him?)If you mind buying a game for 12,99 Euro that needs quite some work (not meaning the content and content balance here, but especially the technical side), then wait a while and see how it turns out.I think the game is worth playing. If you want to have a more polished experience its worth having it on your radar for a while and then jump in."

Once a player understands the controls, it is comparitively quick to play compared to other 4X games and yet still has a great deal of depth and a range of options for playability for various styles.    For a person like me who has a lot of personal demands upon my time, this has been a great way to feed my 4X game appetite.    I feel like in my dozens of hours of game play that I have hardly hit the surface of the game on many levels, and yet, the economic system and combat are straightforward and fast.  At times, I micromanage as much as possible while at others, I put my ships on autopilot and sit back and watch the action.    It has the feel of a universe which I am still exploring...and a game which will occupy many hours and days of my time."

76561198073023472,Recommended,439720,21653566,"Posted: 5 March, 2016",all,Tsrintox,"First off I recommend to anyone to play the demo/old versions which are availible for free before making this purchase, keep in mind those versions are really buggy.Arts design is great in my opinion factions are varied enough to distinguish one faction from another, however UI leaves much to be desired and becomes hard to manage later on when you have an empire of ships. Events are well thought out, and provide good universe story telling I haven't seen all of them but I hope there are more in future updates. Music is fine I personally am not crazy about it, but I see it's appeal. Stability wise I've run into a crash or an error for every 4ish hours of leaving the game running since the last patch.Focusing on the 4 x aspects:Economy in the game is modelled pretty well and tied to the questing system and the player feels like you are actually a part of the economy, however some factions feel too player dependant and fail to keep up with other factions unless actively supported. Automation makes it easy to manage your faction and allows you to work on a variety of tasks as the player without having to micro every ship.I really enjoyed combat, once familiar with the controls battles become much easier but still manage to stay interesting. Combat requires skill, I was able to take down 2 capital ships, a carrier and it's escort with a single fast cruiser, and I have lost player controlled capital ships to fighters.I recommend tutorials for empire building if you are new to these types of games,I jumped right in because I am used to space 4x games and it took me an hour to figure out that I needed to transfer funds from trades into other parts of the economy to build stations. Empire building is also interesting.If you want to play a rags to riches game and stay fairly neutral, you want to focus on taking an open system as soon as possible peacefully, as the other empires grow fast. However pirates and the antagonst faction grow too fast in my opinion.Exploration leaves much to be desired, which ties into the event/questing systems. More unique events triggered by exploring a certain number of places or finding artifacts, would really serve this game well. There is so much potential for exploration that the dev has not yet explored in the current version, scouting/exploration quests would be really nice."

Using just your freighter to build your space empire is always a great feeling. Utilizing your enemies shipyards to create a fleet to destroy them is always fun. If you can cripple a fleet, it will take a long time for that faction to rebuild their fleet, allowing you to gobble up space.The empire management is very tedious when you start erecting stations. You can't take over pirate controlled territories. The colony management is hidden unless you click on literally everything. Actually controlling your forces is tedious and feels wonky most of the time. I easily got my budget wrong by not putting enough money into trading, and it took forever to get a ratio I liked.I think its a great core game, especially since I dumped alot of time into X2, but it needs to be bug stomped and flesh out the user interface.The music is incredible though...great beat to conquer the galaxy to.I love the game, but it's almost a complete rip off of X2...down to the exact names of the stations. On top of that, I'm pretty sure the art resources were ripped straight from AI War. Hopefully it's the same guys that made that game, because it's pretty damn similar."

Mostly because I like the space 4x but you can start from the bottom up. I did the introduction and seemed somewhat ok. Lack of some things in it though. And once I finished the intro I decided to play a sandbox. Holy s*** is it hard. The UI needs a serious clean up, especially if you are playing a large map and you have ship everywhere. Like seriously where the heck is my ships getting destroyed from. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING: THE COMPANY, ANARKIS GAMING USED THE SAME IMAGES FOR BASES, DOCKS, EVEN ALOT OF THE SHIPS FROM THE GAME AI WAR: FLEET COMMAND WHICH IS NOT MADE BY THE SAME COMPANY.

I take all the aspects worth noting and just discuss them without any bias or long lists of pros and cons. Now, This game is EXACTLY what ive been looking for in modern space sims, This is what so many have wanted and finally theres a game where you can start off as a merchant flying one ship, and eventually play the game like an RTS once youve built a huge empire. Your decisions you make when trading, being a pirate, building stations, it all matters, because you can become a major player on the stage and interact with the other huge factions. Were you a pirate near the federation territory? Well theyll probably declare war on your affiliated faction. The frontlines will move from sector to sector as you see actual soverign territory being claimed by the stronger of the factions. As for the economic side, Im familiar with making money and managing assets but have not had an extremely long and drawn out game to see if it has any kinks, so far, so good in that aspect. The state of the game, is moderately buggy, but its not unplayable. The occasional crashes/freezes happen, but my autosave saves the day and theres already been a number of patches out since release. I could go further in depth about this game, but ill simplify it questions. Do you like X3? Do you wish that X3's universe would actually change? Do you wish you could have an impact on politics after youve become a quintillionaire? Do you want youre grinding as a trader/mercenary/bounty hunter/etc. to mean something? If you said yes to all these questions, then BUY THIS GAME."

I get in the game I choose ""Lost Fleet"" I customize said fleet even made my own logo for them. 10seconds into the game everytime my ships wouuld start to blow up and nothing was on the screen.The learning curve is quite extensive is my guess but the tutorial stopped after it told me how to access the ship stats by pushing X, that was it after that I never had another tutorial hint I was left in the water that was actually quicksand.Unit selection is ... harder than what you would think. You have to select and hit space to have the unit actually selected. Setting a unit to ""defense shooting"" is irrelevent as the game instantly puts it back to default.The only thing I found cool was controlling a ship but my ship went off screen and I had no way of moving the camera, camera controls are lacking and for an RTS it is quite vital."

There is a lot of assets from Tyrian the scrolling shooter game from 1995 (I loved that game, playing till early hours of the morning and so seeing the sprites from it as playable ships was nice) Sadly that is all I have so far found positive about itThe game has been quite confusing, it is difficult to understand what each option is affecting when setting up a sandbox game. What I really want to do is start a game where each empire starts off with a basic amount of assets and funds then race against them to expand. This is just a personal preference to have and has not affected my view in order to give it a negative rating.Controlling the ships is really difficult, it took me a while to figure out how to have a ship follow and protect you, I tried to find it in the ships own sub menu (because that seems like a more sensible place to have it, most of the control options on each ship are there after all.) What you have to do is select the ship you want to order then click on order ship to follow/protect in the bottom left corner of the screen and then, right click on the ship you want it to protect. This doesnt make sense because right click is what you use to fire your weapons on your own ship and twice it has fired after the order given and I have shot another empire ship and declared war *&%! .I can go through some of the other flawed aspects of the UI, however I will simply say I do not reccomend this game. Perhaps if it's menu system got an overhaul and it was given a longer tutorial other than a quick 5 min demo of controls and docking/accessing a station then I would give it a thumbs up."
