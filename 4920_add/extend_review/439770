76561198136352089,Not Recommended,439770,20858311,"Posted: 30 January, 2016",all,nmjjmn,"This game suffers from a very simple design flaw. In the game there are challenges, and certain stats need to be a specific level in order to get through it without losing health. For example your strength stat might need to be at 20 in order to push an annoying troll into a fire. Only one problem, your stats need to be extremely high for every one of these challenges.So unless you devote every single choice you make to advancing a couple of certain skills, you'll fail. It's not an autmatic failure, which is good, but eventually you'll run out of health. And even if you do keep improving certain skills, sometimes it won't even give you an option to use them, and thus, you'll lose even more health. I really wanted to like this game, but I'm afraid it forces you to keep improving the same skill over and over again, which makes for a very limited experience.Story's good, but that's about it I'm afraid."

,Not Recommended,439770,20902335,"Posted: 1 February, 2016",all,Kind Buddy,"While I found the setting of this game intriguing, I can't recommend it.My largest complaint with this title is that I felt like a spectator, and not a participant of the game. I noticed getting told how I felt and what I thought, and most choices just boiled down to me either interacting with others as a normal person, being a complete jerk to them, or ignoring them completely. I can't think of a single choice I made in the game that actually felt meaningful to me.Another bad thing about this game is that it seems to have 3 chapters. This is only chapter 1, as far as I can tell, and felt incredibly short to me. I actually restarted about 3 or 4 times, and it still only took me 2 hours to beat it. There were also at least 3 times that I was forced into failure as a way of continuing the story, though I only played as a mage, so it may be possible to avoid some of those.There are other CYOA's out there that aren't going to leave you on a cliffhanger, are longer, and have more varied choice."
,Not Recommended,439770,20852202,"Posted: 30 January, 2016",all,Xenoverge,Storyline is good but you get many options and no idea in knowing if you can do them or not.And some options require too much stat so early on in the game.Other similar games do a better job in informing if you can do something or not or only the options you can successfully do will be available to choose or in bold.This game needs some more mechanics. At least automatic failure does not mean immediate death so loosing a roll is not the end of the game. But later on you don't know if this choice can be done or not because you don't know how much skill you require and eventually you will end up dying.
76561198006616886,Recommended,439770,20915969,"Posted: 2 February, 2016",all,Mechamorph,"One of the more mechanically complex offerings from the Hosted Games line, Fall of Daria serves as an excellent opening to what is planned as a triology. The story is well-written with a large degree of customization from the onset. The game attempts to get you invested in both your character's upbringing and the relationship they have with their guardian. The villains remain largely an enigma in this chapter and it is implied that they are simply being human; most of the conspirators appear to be opportunists rather than any sort of dedicated evil mastermind.If the game has a flaw, its that there is too much customization. As there are a plethora of stats, and thus stat checks, no one character can pass a majority of them. Just like in old pencil and paper tabletop RPGs, your character belongs to a Class and should behave accordingly. Although in theory the game is skill based, due to the fact that large stat gains are generally found in adopting class levels, it is in effect a Class system. Thieves generally do not do well at stand up fights and magicians should not try to pick locks. Splitting your focus will render many of the harder stat checks impossible. So approach this game with this in mind.As the first chapter, it does well enough to set up the premise and gives you the freedom to guide your character's training for the upcoming challenges. It also features a colourful cast although without the right interactions, most of their characterization is only hinted at rather than stated outright. Overall its strengths lie in the story rather than system although the latter still services its role. Think of it as akin to one of the more mechanically driven gamebooks like Lone Wolf or Blood Sword and if that appeals to you, then this game should be your cup of tea."

But that is the only big flaw.For the price its at I'd say go for it."

,Not Recommended,439770,24505380,"Posted: 24 July, 2016",all,Basilissa Leonora,"While this game has a good and solid plot, it falls in the stats section. The required stats are abnormally high and ruined the game for me. Want to make a mage assassins? No can do, only one skill is possible, otherwise you fail every single skill challenge in the game. Put all your egs in one basket and hope for the best. Same goes with in the relationship sector. No point trying to ""please"" anyone. Just pick your favorites and lick their asses.So don't buy this game unless you're completely sure that being thing X for the entire journey is what you want"

Others have complained that you don't know if you can do something until you fail, but this adds more risk to the game, it's like in dnd trying to do something and not knowing what you'll roll. Unlike other choice of games I have played (A Study in Steampunk, Choice of Robots, Choice of Romance, and Pendragon Rising) stats are everything in this game. There is no ""right"" option to choose from if all of your stats are mediocre, and there seems to be no way to perfect every skill, adding more tact to the game as well.In short, fun game, especially if you like dnd and would prefer a more difficult text adventure."

76561198007593792,Recommended,439770,20870059,"Posted: 31 January, 2016",all,SpectatorBehold,"The game is well-written, offers plenty of choices in plenty of aspects; there's many different classes you can choose to be (Wizard, Bard, Druid and so on), you can choose to be good or evil, to become more like your hated enemy or to reject being like him. There's a bunch of likeable companions - which you can romance if you like, and those romances are rather well done as well. All in all, a game worth it's price.That said, there's some risk that you'll end up frustrated in the beginning, for the risk is that, because you don't always know what stat increases your choices will lead to, or if it'll be enough - your first characters will likely end up... Lacking in several aspects - my very first PCs back from when I played on the CoG site were so lacking at the end that I didn't bother saving those for the sequel. Keep trying though, for it is certainly possible to end up with a character powerful in several ways at the end - and even if you you don't, that is not necressarily fatal as the game can be lenient enough even to a PC that is lacking in several ways at the end."

I must say though it looks like I have missed a considerable amount of content by accidently cutting to the main story events but I will review from what I have seen so far;Overall I'd say the story is very well written, the characters are interesting and you care enough about them. My only real complaint was the length of the story which i feel was somewhat short but perhaps that was my own doing.I would recommend it to anyone who likes interactive stories though, certainly worth two quid anyway."

The writing and characterisation is fantastic, the backstory was interesting and the method of choice-making really made me want to play it through with different choices. Although only text, this game like any good story felt engrossing and kept me itching to continue. The part which I enjoyed the most was how personal the story felt because of the many choices I was forced to make. It made me feel as though it were really my story, and that element combined with the freedom to imagine made possible by the lack of visual narrative just sucked me right in.I just finished and already I'm about to play again. I can't wait for the sequels and I hope you're proud of this story you've written."

I have yet to buy book 2 and will purchase it soon!When my friend told me about this book all he told me about his story was that he was a mage, a good guy, and: ""Don't f*** up in the end like I did... It is VERY depressing"". And so for the whole entire book I was focusing on not screwing up, I spent hours and hours playing this game and focusing on 1: Having good relationships with everyone, (especially Petra... she's my bae <3 xD) I was literally so focused on having good relationships that when I did something that made my lover mad at me, and then when I tried to kiss her she HATED me.... So I restarted the whole book, did all my exact answers up to that point JUST so I am able to get that kiss! Yeah Yeah I was addicted shut up, it is a good book! (PS thats the only time I restarted xD)Anyway: This book his highly recommended, I've already got plenty of my friends to play it and they fell in love just as quickly as I did. You can be bad, or you can be good. I was a good guy, didn't get a single thing of bad reputation throughout the whole game B) Mostly because the next time I went through the book I named myself Bad@$$ Bruce (Don't know if I'm able to say that stuff so a censorship will just be placed just in case :P) and I was a complete thug and a HUGE D*CK throughout the book, just to see what it was like... Well I had plenty more cash, but not very many friends, and it just wasn't very satisfying in the end :(.But through all this rambling all I'm trying to say is that this is an amazing story and I recommend in all the way, who needs $3.99 anyway? What're you gonna spend it on a lunchable? Nah how bout this game! Much better idea! And here's some advice that I will pass on: ""Don't f*** up in the end, it's VERY depressing"" ;)All right I hope all have a good time playing! (*-*)/"

However, their is a warning, the set of games, especially the last one, are harder than most of these type of games. The writing is great, the stats carry over between games, different events can happen based on the stats you have or what classes you choose. However, for your first run, expect to fail. However, there is a lot of replay value in these games and they are very enjoyable.This game details the start of the story, you are chased away from your home and made an orphan. You become an adventurer and do a few jobs to build skills, then go after the guy who made you into an outcast. It is a great start. It is fun to learn about your companions and do side quests with them. There is also a variety of classes you can become, with some good paths you can take, specializing in weapons or magic or stealth, or some combination of them."

I really enjoyed it and bought some more like it.Pros:-I was really drawn in by the lore. Made me want to explore the world and learn more about it.-You get to choose the gender of several of your companions, which is great for romance options.-Good mix of interesting characters. Options to kill/leave characters you don't like and develop relationships with ones you do.-Can't beat that price, $5 Canadian.Cons:-You have to limit yourself to building up one type of character, otherwise you will fail alot. Which can be interesting, but I feel like i'm missing the better parts of the story.-Just when the story felt like it was really taking off, it just ended.Final Verdict:-I would highly recommend this for anyone who likes a good adventure story. Even though the cons I mentioned seem pretty big, the price+story make it hard to pass up."
