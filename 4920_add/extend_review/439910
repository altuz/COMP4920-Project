While there is an option to play with bots, it only works if you hit the button before the game automatically joins you to another human opponent.I much prefer to play with bots, especially while I am trying to figure a game out."

Pro-tip: in fact, it's more like a classic River Raid than UGH! or Space Taxi. Pure retro. Totally recommended.P.S.The competitive vs BOT mode is not that bad actually. I kinda liked it as it kept the game going pretty well and the bot acts silly sometimes so it can even make you laugh - almost like with a real human player. I don't care whether this is as intended or not but far too many developers forget to emulate such behaviour when writing an AIs. Oh, and the BOT crashes himself with shame when you are ahead of him, rescuing the folks faster than he can ^^."

A quick thrill for $1 is worth it if you just want to try something quick out. Plus it has steam cards. Worth the purchase, however it would be much better on mobile."

The controls are simple, but nothing innovative to  them like they claim. Overall there is very little content, 50 levels of which you must do with bots or online/with friends, so the only real single player is the endless mode. The levels themselves are easy enough to 3 star, makiing the achievements relatively easy to get, except for one, which baffles me, you get about 20-30 gold per level complete with 3 stars, I'm not sure the exact scaling for it, but you need about 26000 gold for all the different choppers, which is absurd, I am currently grinidng endless mode to try to get this last acchievement jsut because I would feel weird leaving it unfinished, but the amount of time it's taking for the amount of content in the actual game is ludicrous to say the least. Luckily it's a cheap game, so you won't lose much if you play it outside of some time spent elsewhere. Overall it's a short simple waste of time if you have nothiing better to do, but there is nothing new or innovative here."
,Recommended,439910,26133062,"Posted: 20 October, 2016",all,Sweep,"Based on a mobile game, Risky Rescue is an action game where you fly your helicopter and try to rescue as many survivors as possible.The concept of the gameplay is simple. Click left to make your helicopter go left and up. Click right to make it go right and up. And yep, you can't make it fly straight fly. The basic reaction of someone would be to think this game plays poorly, especially with the fact it's a port of a mobile game.Actually, the gameplay is done incredibly well! Heck, it's very playable! Easily one of the best mobile ports on Steam, Risky Rescue doesn't disapoint.What we have here is a simple game that is addictive, fun and well made. A quality product. It has some nice 2D graphics, too!This game has a justified price, too. There are many levels to complete, and it will keep you on for many hours. Money well spent.Risky Rescue runs on Windows 10!10/10 From MeSweep"

76561198019216815,Recommended,439910,30362397,Posted: 6 March,all,Crebmen,"Risky Rescue is simplistic arcade game in which you fly around small levels as a helicopter, collect citizens in distress, and return back to the starting-point in the shortest time possible.There are 50 levels in total, and if you're good at the game you'll be able to finish them all in about 30 minutes. Weirdly enough, each level pits you against another player to compete against in order to move on to the next stage. Because I was unable to find an online match-up I defaulted to playing against bots for the entire game. The bots worked for the most part but they always used the same AI path for each level, making them pretty easy to cheese and get higher scores with.As an extra-challenge I can see why the competitive gameplay mechanics were included, but for the type of game Risky Rescue is I'm curious as to why there isn't a true single player.There's also an endless game-mode which basically has you infinitely scaling a randomized, vertical stage that gets increasingly difficult as you ascend. I think that if you enjoy the base-gameplay you'll appreciate having this extra game-mode, but I personally didn't find it interesting enough to keep playing.Ricky Rescue ALSO features a plethora of unlockable helicopters which you can buy using the in-game gold you get from completing levels and playing endless mode. Oddly, the cost of unlocking these helicopters is a bit absurd considering the amount of content this game has to offer. After playing through the singleplayer and getting mostly 3-star ratings on each level, plus playing enough of endless to get all of its achievements, I still didn't even have enough gold to unlock even the highest-priced helicopter.I also never felt the need to unlock anything anyways because the game never got difficult enough to warrant it. I guess with endless mode you might find a reason to use better helicopters, but I feel like the online-functionality was supposed to be the thing to incentivise unlocking better helicopters. However, because of the near non-existant player base, it feels weirdly unecessary.PROS:- Clean and pleasing visuals.- Controls are responsive.- Only costs a dollar.MIDDLE GROUND:- Not enough content to have the unlock-system make sense, but it's nice that it's there.- You have to compete against other players or bots during every level with no option to just play on your own.CONS:- Surprisingly short for the type of game it is.- The stiff-controls made my hands hurt after less than an hour of play.SCORE: 6/10It's a solid game at a fair price, but don't expect too much out of it."

Why?Because :- It wasn't buggy like most 1 euro games. I've found no bugs.- It has 50 unique levels where you compete with either a bot or a real person.- It has another mode called endless where you basically save as many people as you can till you die.- You can unlock a lot of choppers but to do so you need to grind a bit. So if you want all achievements/choppers you need to spend some time playing it which is good. 6 hours of gameplay for 50 cents. Yes, please!- There are leaderbords so you have a rank.- Has cards and steam achievements.I definitely recommend buying ""Risky Rescue"". Wait for a sale or even pay full price if you feel like it."

The gameplay isn't fulfilling or worth a dollar/euro/pound, but it'll waste a few minutes.There's supposed to be online multiplayer but nobody else is playing (obviously), so that's dead. There *might* be a local multiplayer option but I didn't check.You get a few card drops out of it and if you sell them you basically get your 10 cents right back. Nothing gained, nothing lost.

For example, the game goes nuts as soon as I connect my Xbox One controller, so I am forced to use my keyboard to play. Besides, you either play against the computer or another player. So, no proper single player (like the mobile version) and the multiplayer is always competitive: no real co-op; I mean, you cannot co-operate with a friend to pick up the people together, but to do it before the other player does.I am going to ask for a refund until the game is more polished and a real co-op is added."

If you move left/right you gain altitude, if you don't move, you drop altitude. It's a race against the opponent to collect the most tourists and come back to landing zone, played on the split screen – it is slightly annoying that on my half of the screen I can see a shadow of the bot, it uses always the same chopper as the player so sometimes it gets confusing. Over 20 choppers with different stats and 50 maps are available.It can offer 2-3 hours of fun. For £0.79 I think it's worth it."

,Not Recommended,439910,22227184,"Posted: 3 April, 2016",all,TigerTrix,"Barely OK, easy, but awkward controls.  Takes about an hour to play 50 simple levels.  Then you can just try to get 3-stars on each level, and grind to purchase other helicopters (the default one is fine).  A few problems: (1) The controls are awkward.  You only have right & left which make you go up-right or up-left and it automatically descends in the last direction when not going up & right/left.  You might be able to use down to decelerate down-left/right faster, but is unecessary.  (2) Your star rating seems based in time, which includes your partner, not how many guys you rescued more than the bot, but you still have to rescue more than the bot to proceed, and if the bot takes a while your rating is hurt.  Still, I ended up with 1-3 stars per level on first try, better if the bot crashed because it stops the time immediately if waiting for him.  It is partly cooperative, pertly competitive which is odd.  (3) I don't see any point to buying other helicopters.  It is so wonky as it is that I can't imagine controlling it if it were faster.  It was really ackward at first, but rather OK later.  I was happy to reach level 50 and be done, but wasn't bad by then.I was hoping it would be similar to Space Taxi (C64), but it plays nothing like it.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, but it is tolerable if you really wanted it."
