BUT you can see where they want to go with the game. These are some grand plans that they have. Right now, this is a workable demo, and no that is not a bad thing. Buying this game right now is supporting the further development of the game. Don’t buy it expecting a polished product. There are bugs, there are crashes and yes there are issues. If you are looking for a game to support this is a great one to get behind."

A very, very long way to go. I bought this one because I was hoping for something a bit new and am still hoping it will be. What I find frustrating is that these games and now starting to get released before you can even play the game to any degree. This is one of those games.The controls are almost all counterintuitive and confusing, if they work at all. Took me 5 minutes to figure out you have to hit left control to get off a horse. The inventory system is borked and unless it gets a major overhaul, will enf up being as bad as I've seen.Again I have my fingers crossed this game progresses but right now I would not recommend anyone buys into it. In fact I've requested a refund and I'll instead monitor it from afar."

But there are some really basic things that are missing. For example no settings page on the home screen. Sometimes its nice to turn down render distance on games like this but you don't have that option. Second when you are in game there is no options tab. I spent a few minutes pressing every single button to see what they did. The concept seems cool and for early access I thought the graphics were decent, but just adding some basic things to help the user at the beginning would be great.Also maybe a tutorial. Hope the devs don't abandon it. Gonna be one of those deals where if there is no movement in the next few weeks I would ask for your money back. 12 bucks for an active always improving game is reasonable, but a dead game......We shall see."
,Not Recommended,439950,21650620,"Posted: 5 March, 2016",all,Bubbles,"I really love games that are set in the Wild West and there aren't many good games in this setting, so I was really looking forward to play Frontier. But seriously, as much as you might love the setting, this is not something to be published, even in early access alpha and far from being enjoyable. The controls are horrible, the environment looks boring and every part of every animation of EVERYTHING in this game looks and feels clunky. Usually I'd keep this game and see if it evolves over time, but this short experience was so utterly devastating that I refunded it, because for me there is no hope that any game can evolve from this into something good and enjoyable. I'd highly recommend to watch some gameplay footage before purchasing it. Unfortunaly another EAA title that in my opinion will never become a finished product with enough qualitative content. I would love to see the devs prove me wrong, but I seriously doubt it."

This is pretty much Early Access at its... um... earliest? Consider yourself warned. I'm only recommending this because I love the concept, and there aren't many games in this setting.It's also a game that highlights the flaws in the Steam review system. You don't want to give it a bad review this early, but giving it a thumbs up is a bit dishonest as well.Anyway, it' s a thumbs up because I don't want to hurt the game's chances. It's a thumbs down because it's only playable in the loosest sense of the word."
,Recommended,439950,21631516,"Posted: 4 March, 2016",all,Jaybberwocky,"First thing I need to say here is that I bought this game willingly and knowing that it is in early access. Keep this in mind. These are simple observations for constructive use. Not pointless criticisms. I LOVE the concept of the game but in this current state it is obviously very raw. This is more of a first impression than a proper review.To the developers; the ""Quit"" button does not work in the main menu. Click = nothing happensAlso, menu options only being outside of the game itself is not a good way to construct your interface. I have no real experience creating video games so I don't know how easy/difficult it would be to fix these things but these are just simple aspects that could end up making or breaking your game.I have found even in the small amount of gameplay I've engaged with that there are many animals that will not attack or even run away when you shoot them. I eventually found my way into a valley after having spent some time gathering animal parts/rocks/trees etc. and ran into two wolves attacking a deer that was running in place. I killed one wolf and punched about 12 rounds into the other one, to no effect. The deer did not die either and there seemed to be a rather large hit barrier around all three of them, preventing me from getting too close to them.As I mentioned above, I am aware this game is one day out of release. But I'd like to support you guys as much as possible in terms of reporting bugs/fixes/possible changes. And as you know, there will be a LOT of them.I am very interested in the concept of this game and I have been hoping for a Red Dead Redemption-esque PC title for a long time. You have something here that has amazing potential. I sincerely hope this game gets to full release and contains everything you've proposed.Will give a rating upon further releases."

Rode a horse (shame you cannot move direct of the horse with your mouse) Shot a fox, brawled with a bear, stabby stab and its dead.  But then a wolf joined in and killed me.Controls felt rather clunkyGraphics I hope will get better.Do I recomend this game?  Only if you want to support the dev.   Its really really Pre Alpha.  Every aspect needs lots of work.  Hopefully people will buy and the dev really will use the funds to create what can be a great game.Its been a long time since their was a western sandbox game.  Adding survival, building etc will be ace.   Please dev no stupid future weapons.  Please only use weapons we could find back then.  Although adapting them like a 6 shooter upgrades to a 12 be cool.   Tripple shotgun. etc.Anyway please suppot this game i so want a great western."

There is a lot of work to be done.Game is limited in terms of weapons/tools (lever shotgun, knife/pickaxe, axe), crafting, only animal enemies and also the environment looks the same. You can mine rocks and cut trees. I had issues with wood not triggering in my inventory and could not craft some items that needed 3 wood when i actually had 8. There are bears, hogs, wolves, deers and bunnies. You can drink whisky and vision becomes blurry or maybe that was the marijuana tree. No story line and not much to do for now.  If you  are tight on cash maybe wait but if you like these games like me even if it goes nowhere you can always buy it. There is no multiplayer, no story and you cannot die from hunger but wolfs and bears can kill ya. You have a horse and you can leap like deers. There is no fall damage.There is not much to do as you can see from this youtube video.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4p_R-HLB3s&feature=youtu.be"

76561198239788094,Recommended,439950,29178140,Posted: 10 January,all,Gadianton,"Yes its in Early, Early Access. However, It truly is an incredible and beautiful game, with a simple build that has enormous potential. You have to automatically love the Wild west feel. They really nailed the landscape and scenery. The rifle you spawn with is pretty accurate for the time.Skyrim type  Loading screen.Great soundtrack at the begining, kudos to whomever developed that song.Reflections are awesome, very detailed on how the daylight and moonlight reflect on different surfaces.Next is why I really think this game is a keeper.Thunderstorm was AMAZING- expected a flashflood to careen down the canyon, plant movement blowing in the wind, thunder rolling, lightning brilliantly lights up the sky, and wind blowing through leaves sound. Misty mountain sides, vison obscured, the whole time its raining, its an amazing, and extremly realistic feel.Moonlight and nighttime is beautifulThe distance to see a campfire is super realistic, i've been out in the desert where you can see any type of light from super far away, which is the case here. (because its dark at night, with only the moon and the stars)Wall mount mechanics are wonderful, the wall mounts snap to the walls quite well.Intuitive reloading system and using the same key for object rotation. Speaks to the three coders. A lot of coding goes in to that small flawless switch of needed controls.Again, there are plenty of bugs in building mechanics, and they have plenty to do, but the potential and options for this game are endless.  It fits the perfect criteria of a much desired, and extremly empty genre of  Sandbox Western Frontier game that hopefully will have a story line and an optional RPG feel to it.It's time people support this group. This type of game is what the world needs next."

The hunting is pretty awesome to. It brings back that western feel and what it was like back in the day for them. This game also has a lot of work to be done but I think its great for just being released. If you like crafting and building and having to defend for your self out in the wild then this is for you!!! There are some things that need work for example the building is not perfect, it has trouble snapping the walls and floors together. Also movement needs some work to but really this game is pretty awesome and I suggest it for all you people that like to survive. I want to see better body movements and maybe even 3rd person. Also maybe some tools to level the land. Another part of this game that needs help is that everytime I build a house I will exit the game to take a break or whatever and then I get back on and part of my house is missing! Building needs some work!"

That doesn't bother me. What does bother me is that I purchased it because it was one of the few survival games available for the Mac, and yet here it is, several months down the road, and I still have yet to be able to even open the game. The developer said that they were working on a fix when I bought the game, and they urged us Mac users to be patient. They took our money, paid in good faith of getting, if not a perfect product, at least one that functioned as it was designed to do. Now I see that they are still selling the game to Mac users, but they have removed the Mac system requirements from the Store page. That is an incredibly underhanded way to do business. Unfortunately, some Mac users have sought refunds from Steam and have been denied, and the devs have done nothing to rectify the situation. They may be a small team, but they have an obligation to those of us who have paid them money to deliver what they promised. I'm a patient person, but this is ridiculous."

Keep that in mind when playing and enjoy the features the game currently has. It is the first game that made me write a review so far.The game runs buttery smooth on my end. It has no real settings menu yet and you can see some things are made with a higher standard then others, but I am sure this will be worked on. Some textures for instance look really good. Some of them don't.Movement feels good though animations do seem to feel a little scripted and clean. This is however not different to any other early access game in its infancy and I can only imagine these things will receive the refinement they need as great things are possible with this game engine.This is the first game in the genre that I was drawn to. And for the price of a pizza it is a great way to support the devs in making it the game it could one day be.10/10, would skip pizza again to buy this game."

The idea of a western themed survival game is not a bad idea at all. But that is all it is. It started with 3 guys in their basement and now I think it's just one guy, that works on his project on weekends between his daytime job. This should have never released. We could play it for about a month, then total silence and no updates. The guy basically updates every 6 months, saying he has to recode the whole thing. And we might see an update about 10 years from now. This development is unacceptably slow. No idea why steam authorizes these jokes. It should be illegal.
