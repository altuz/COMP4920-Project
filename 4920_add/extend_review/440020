,Not Recommended,440020,21986591,"Posted: 22 March, 2016",all,Azure Fang,"EDIT 03/29/16: Today, I had a lengthy discussion with the creator of bitDungeon+, who has stated that the issues below will be addressed. While he has requested that I not change this review until said fixes go through, I felt it necessary to at least mention that they will be worked on. Stay tuned!When this game released on Early Access, I was intrigued. I've spent many hours playing bit Dungeon on mobile, and I enjoy bit Dungeon II. bit Dungeon+, however, has fallen so miserably short that I am sincerely tempted to request a refund.First and foremost, navigating the menu is a game in and of itself, considering there are no prompts to let you know what does what. Multiple keys appear to function as back and forward, yet there are no guides (only ""humorous"" comments like ""are you a master or a chicken""), so it is not uncommon to find yourself on the wrong difficulty in the wrong mode because you hammer random keys to try to get somewhere. And no, you cannot check key bindings; accessing the control menu immediately forces you to begin rebinding all keys, and will then kick you out of the menu once you have rebound. Speaking of changing settings, there are NO audio or resolution options; by default, the game is set to an unlocked window that may or may not be largely off screen, and volume is so loud it is recommended you start the game on MUTE and adjust your operating system or speaker volume once in.Once in game, there are, again, no prompts to let you know what does what. You have to remember what you have bound, or hammer keys until you figure it out. The ""tutorial"" is laughable, stepping you through rooms telling you to ""push the attack button"" without enlightening you as to what the attack button might be. Out of the tutorial, things pickk up, but only slightly. Accessing the map/menu, and no, there is no persistent minimap, lets you see your stats and equipment, though even this is rough as stat numbers bleed over text and become jumbled, and checking equipment is on a spring and bound to your movement keys; be careful, as holding right to check your sword may lead you into the next room unprepared since the movement controls are still active.Save your money on this one. Spend it on a polished dungeon crawler like Sword of the Stars: The Pit or The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. If you still really want this game, wait to see if they continue to patch it (or at least fix the horrible grammar and spelling in the stupid menu messages).To those coming back to this review, yes, I deleted my old review as I expected it to change since early access. It has: it's gotten worse. And considering these are now my impressions from the ""released"" game, the ""pre-release"" flag no longer applies. This should not have left early access in this state."

Most the buttons were working after a few minutes of problem solving but I still couldnt find a magic button playing as player 2. Then there was the problem that regardless of how we tried we couldnt get past the last step in the tutorial because the game wouldnt let us pick up the key after checking our map. Finally got it to work after another 15 min of trying and 10 min later we were glitched out side a room with only half of the room next to it showing.

Do you like resetting the game because it changes the control mapping? Do you like beating a game to get three seconds of the end of a love story that never had a beginning only to warp back to level 1 (and every time you try to progress again, you continue to warp back to level 1, with subsequently harder enemies)? Do you like a tutorial that forces you to replay the same scenario ten times before you're allowed to progress? Do you like getting two instant achievements and never making any progress to the rest of them? Do you like when the bosses in the game are the easiest part? Do you like reloading a dungeon to see if the monsters randomly become incredibly harder or your attack triples and they are a cakewalk? (Actually, those last two aren't so bad.)If you can answer yes to any of the above questions, a job as a gimp or playing this game might be for you! Bonus content includes non-working game modes, a pause menu that only pauses the game half of the time, and crappy boots that turn into a great sword that later turn back into crappy boots. Ultimately, I'm convinced that whoever coded this game must have horrible object oriented skills and thus decided to use C, despite probably not knowing C. The credits showed 8 people were involved, only one--which I hope never touches code again--was a programmer.Dear only programmer of bit Dungeon+:I hope when you go to hell, you have to play your game. I doubt you ever did before release.10 / 10, would reload again to see if my attack increases or I get that sword back."

(As one would expect from an Early Access game)Some things that need to be addressed ASAP:-Music and SFX volume- No way to lower the volume, and it is blaringly, obnoxiously loud at the moment.-Really uninuitive collecting of gear in chests. (at least while using a controller)-Walking through doors, or rather, NOT walking through doors. That abrupt freezing of movement for a good 1-2 seconds before moving to a new room feels really bad, makes the game feel clunky.-The ""Babel's Tower"" mode seems to be completely broken____________________But since this is a bD game, there is plenty of other reasons to love this game!-Excellent character designs, each enemy looks really unique and iconic.-Music is retro and fun-Endless gameplay is always fun, especially fun knowing that dying is so punishing!Looking forward to the official release! :-D"

,Recommended,440020,21616117,"Posted: 3 March, 2016",all,Sluice Master,"PARAGRAPH WARNING. Yes, I have a lot to say.I recommend ONLY if you want to see an unplayable game turn into something (potentially) cool.Decent idea, but right now awful execution.If you purchase this game right now and expect fun, you're in for a bad time. Details below.I'll just say right now that, while the makers of the game aren't primarily English-speakers, it looks pretty bad to have so many spelling and grammatical errors. Get those fixed.It's a very simple hack-and-slash thing, playing similarly to Binding of Isaac and the original Zelda.Go through randomized dungeons and hit monsters in each room until they die. Stat-giving equipment is all over the place.==BASIC GAMEPLAY & INTERFACE==You're a knight with a basic melee weapon and a shield. That's currently the only starting class. You have avatar sets, but they are entirely cosmetic; that greatsword is gonna swing identically to that scythe.You have an attack button, a magic button, and a block button (Default A S and D). That last one is important, because timing to block enemy attacks will keep you from otherwise requiring trades. A single hit can just chip at your health, but you are in rooms with three to like twenty enemies at once, and they're all attacking on their own patterns, so if you never touch that shield you're going to be dead in three rooms.Kiting around and blocking effectively is key to getting hits in without taking damage. It's definitely trying to feel like a top-down Souls game -- a concept that is entirely responsible for keeping me around.Unnfortunately, having three buttons doesn't mean the game is immediately accessible. Thanks to an almost complete lack of interface or instructions, I didn't even understand that I had a block button. The launch options window says 'Fire 1' 'Fire 2' and 'Fire 3'. Ignore these completely, because there's an in-game options menu for that. It says 'Controllers' but it really means 'Controls'.They don't even have a setting to rebind Up Down Left and Right, opting to have default-blank 'Vertical' and 'Horizontal' axes. Just ignore those input settings.Oh, don't set anything to Z, either, because that's the debug mode key for spawning a random chest, it seems.Yes, this executable is for DEBUGGING.==GAME FEEL & CONTROL BUGS==The controls are meant to be a little bit clunky and require thought to timing, but the stiffness leads to exasperation more than anything. You will often find yourself stuck swinging in the wrong direction despite holding down another direction's key. If you're close enough to an enemy, you might not even be able to turn, because it seems as though turning is stopped any time movement is halted. This doesn't happen on walls because they are pushing you back instead of restricting movement entirely.There is a completely unnecessarry delay to most actions. It's caused me to wonder if my keyboard was broken multiple times. There's a small delay before blocking, but no visual indicator that you need to take time to put up the shield. In many cases, it looks like damage went right through your shield.==SOUND==The music and effects themselves are mostly passable. The same dungeon tracks over and over can get pretty annoying, but whatever. Unfortunately, you can't set just the music to 0 and play your own stuff while keeping the sound, because there are no audio options anywhere. The game starts blaring at max and you're forced to change it with the volume slider.This debug version is nigh-unplayable, making you deal with gameplay bugs and expecting you to know what you're doing. Like I said, if this becomes even a half-playable top-down Soulsish game, I'll be happy I got it."

I love the concept of the overhead view, but with a dark souls feel. randomized loot drop and an ever increasing difficulty.. no real sense of leveling, but know that you are getting stronger. I get that not everyone is a fan of these types of games, and some won't even bother to give it a shot. Most will look only to the negative reviews, some to the positive, some at the price.All i can say is, nobody can play the game for you.

There's no ingame option to lower the midi music, and while the game says 2 player local what it fails to tell you is 2 player local means sharing a keyboard and screen.

76561198058598792,Recommended,440020,24859792,"Posted: 12 August, 2016",all,KuroTsubasa,"I bought this game on sale for $0.99 this morning, and after trying it, was really intent on leaving a negative review.  Instead, I've decided that this game has earned a ""positive"", but fairly critical review.  Ultimately, in its current state, I wouldn't recommend it at full price, but definitely give it a try if it's on sale.So my biggest, BIGGEST complaint about this game is the lack of polish.  Compared to the original ""bit Dungeon"" flash game and ""bit Dungeon II"", this game feels like a rushed beta.  All the pieces are there, but it doesn't quite come together.  There are many bugs, and quite a few of them outright ruin the experience.That being said, the developers have ended every update they've released with the statement ""Dolores Entertainment and Kinto Game are working hard for polish the game"".  It seems they're aware of the problem(s), and will hopefully get it into more respectable shape in the near future.This game is a remake of the flash game ""bit Dungeon"".  From a gameplay perspective, it does a good job translating the mouse-based flash game (and touch-based mobile game) into a keyboard/gamepad experience.  A lot of reviews are criticizing the gameplay for not being as engaging as ""bit Dungeon II"".  While I can see where they're coming from, I think they should keep in mind that this was designed to be faithful to the original.  The movement and controls are NOT as fluid as ""bit Dungeon II"", but they weren't supposed to be.  This is a remake of an older game, treat it as such.  Also, the fact that this game uses keyboard/gamepad controls is a pretty clear indication in itself that the developers are listening to the feedback on their previous games.The bugs in this game almost scared me away.  I really intended to stop playing it, but the gameplay was still pretty good.  The music could use some work, with several tracks being a little too ""screechy"".  Overall though, ""bit Dungeon+"" has some decent potential, and I'd love to see what it looks like with all the bugs worked out.If you've played ""bit Dungeon"" or ""bit Dungeon II"", and consider yourself a fan of the series so far, pick this one up.  If you're hesitant (especially with all the bugs at the moment), then pick it up on sale instead.  These games are both cheap, and provide a decent amount of entertainment for their price.---Also, developers, if you could make a quick Linux/SteamOS port of these games, it'd be appreciated.  =DI believe ""bit Dungeon II"" runs on flash, so it should be as simple as exporting/wrapping it right.  This game might take a *little* more work, but probably not that much.  Maybe something to keep in mind after the bugs get worked out.Keep up the good work."

It's a different game, much more interesting imo. I prefer this despite the bugs. Go ahead and give it a shot, it's worth playing. Plus couch coop.The slower space of this (and the amazingly well done 3ds version) make you feel much more in control of the fights. Manual attacks rather than random auto attacks is much more entertaining, and overall it's just a better game for me that bit dungeon 2. BD@ is amazing, sort of open world and had this cool dark souls kill everything steroids feel.This game however feels like an awesome rouge like. I do not like that you loose all of your dark coins upon death, so I don't really know what it means by ""every run gives new challenges"" like you'll upgrade the dungeon or something. If anyone can explain what you do when you die i'd love to know because as far as I see you loose all of your coins, upgrades, etc and just sort of start over.Either way people need to stop looking at the overwhelmingly bad reviews and try it out.

,Not Recommended,440020,32788560,Posted: 25 June,all,RedPoisonDragon_Red-Tech,"It is everything that makes the Flash version different from the second version, but for all of the wrong reasons. It's annoying to play and it's very restricting. It's just not fun. Maybe, if this was the original version of this game, instead of the Flash game, this would be acceptable. The flash game is free. I had to pay for this one. Enough said.If you are looking for a fun game in this style, look for ""Bit Dungeon II"" on Steam, and ""Bit Dungeon Flash"""
