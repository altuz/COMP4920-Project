,Not Recommended,440330,21625852,"Posted: 4 March, 2016",all,Norax,"Pros:The concept is great: You use 10-14 mana points per turn that are shared for all heroes, it refreshes per turn. So it basically behaves like the winds of magic. Each turn a wind of magic gets a boost. Each mage has 5 skills (you start with one) plus 2 extra slots for spells of other winds or items.The skills are cool: The spells has cost, range, damage, splash damage and aoe. aoe can effect friends or not. The effects go from freezen a unit (can't do anything next turn), pushing it back, aoe damage, etc.Cons:You can get 2 more mages without paying. 3 are behind a microtransaction (balthazar gelt, teclis and another one for 4EUR) They are stronger versions than the regular ones. Another one for getting lustria campaign (another 4EUR).You have 2 campaigns, you need to beat the first one in order to get your 3rd mage so you can go in a fullgroup. You need to beat the second one in order to get the last one.You get like 120g per map. 2nd skill cost 250, 3rd 500g. I would guess 4th 750g, and 5th 1.000. For each mage. That means that you need to replay the maps a lot in order to have everything. (Edit: Looks like grinding is not needed, exponential rewards I guess)The camera feels slow to move around, same for rotating it. You can't put it in a top down view, since it's like the best way to put a camera for a tactics game.The card descriptions are too small (maybe they just don't scalate at 1080), feels awkward to click and drag a card (skill) to be able to read the description.So basically I wouldn't recomend it because it feels like a mobile game, despite how interesting the skills feel."
76561198122163777,Recommended,440330,33714441,Posted: 22 July,all,Opal Knight,"I'm really on the line whether to recommend this title or not.I ONLY recommend getting the deluxe version and ONLY if it is offered at a heavily discounted price.The standard version has horrible in-game purchases for unlocking both the added adventure and the extra wizards at too-high a price, plus the annoyances of in-game purchases on card packs.  The deluxe version includes all of this content and turns off the in-game purchases so that you can only buy the card packs via the earned in-game gold (the way the game should have been from the beginning).I'm recommending the game because it can be an OK board game styled, turn-based, strategy game.  You get to choose different cards to equip your wizards' hands for each chapter run.  You earn new cards and powers from random monster drops as well as purchasing them in between chapters with the gold you have accrued.  There are dice rolls (with a little animation) to determine spell failure and successes.  And yet . . .The game just is not made well.  There is one, non-repeatable tutorial which goes over the basics of how battle is played out and once you are through that you will never get any more help from there on out.  They mentioned something about cards you get to keep using vs. cards that you use once and then are gone, but because the tutorial rushed through the basics, I have no idea how you are supposed to know which are which.There are cards you can craft as repeatable use spells, but even though they show certain wizards' face icons underneath, those wizards are often not able to equip them in their hands.  Is it a glitch?  Is there some precondition to equipping the card?  Who knows.  There are no tool tips at all.  They also mention that each wizard gets one type of spell that is their magic affinity but nothing indicates what any of the wizards' specific magic affinities are, and there is nothing on the card which states what affinity it is other than perhaps the color behind the spell title.  Not that it matters, all cards can be equipped by any wizard and any card you can equip (as opposed to the set cards in your wizard's hand) are single-use cards whether they match the color of the other spells in that wizard's hand anyway.At times it feels like I'm playing a board game to which the instruction manual is missing and I have to go off of the description on the back of the box to assume what the rules are on how to play.There is also a narrated story introduction before each chapter, but it has zero relevance to what happens during play and doesn't even correspond to how that chapter's board is set up.  Each chapter plays exactly the same: move your wizards to the power circles scattered across the board and then exit the board on the indicated square.  Monsters appear as you approach each circle, and you use your spell cards to defeat all the monsters before moving on to the next circle.Monster types are pretty repetitive from one chapter to the next.  The first chapter had harpies, trolls and giants, the eighth chapter had harpies, trolls and giants, and maybe three other monster types thrown in.  You get the picture.And, as would be expected of a game that is not designed well, there are plenty of bugs.  I haven't encounted any that have prevented me from continuing on with each chapter, but they are annoying little hiccups which detract from the game as a whole.So, as you can see, this is not a shining example of a great strategy video game.  For the parts of the game that I do understand and know how to play, there is actually some fun to be had.  I think if the designers had spent more effort trying to develop the game and less effort trying to make some sort of a quick cash-grab scheme they could have truly made a well-rounded strategy board game.  I recommend it to those of you who just like to try different turn-based strategy games and can look past a LOT of flaws and still find fun."
76561198040951329,Recommended,440330,21614069,"Posted: 3 March, 2016",all,VbHD,"Note: I had never played this board game before, but am familiar with the universe as a whole.Game launches you into a tutorial which, while not being perfect, and leaving me with some questions, was quite good at explaining the various mechanics, buttons and controls for the game. The things I did not understand during the tutorial were quite easy to figure out on my own.Then I recieved my interface-between-game-session tutorial, which explained everything very well.The game feels really solid for the price I paid (basically 4 dollars). A lot of warhammer games are buggy, have bad interfaces, poor graphics, you name it. While this game is not going to make you crap your pants with how amazing it is, the developer has put a really fair price on it.The strategy aspect of the game is great, had everything I was hoping for, and probably a lot more, since I have not played it far enough to really know it all. The one time in a fight I did not engage my brain, and made a simple mistake, the enemies nearly completely killed my team in one turn.Steam achievements are implemented, and work, without flaws.There are several different wizards in the game, each seeming to use a different 'flavour' of spells. You get a fire mage and a (I think he is like wind/purple) mage after tutorial completion. Two more are unlocked just by completing the story of the game.  Four more mages are unlocked by paying four dollars each. One last mage is unlocked as part of a story expansion costing three dollars.After playing a little longer, I realised I did not cover the chests (Plunder Packs) part of the game. As you play, monsters can drop chests, which if looted within 3 in-game turns (very easy in most cases) will give the player access to scroll card spells. As mentioned previously, each mage has a 'flavour' of spells, and cannot normal cast spells outside their 'flavour'. However, scrolls can be equipped to ANY mage therefore allowing them to cast spells outside their specific limits. Scroll spells are one-time cast only, meaning that the player cannot simply use OP spell X as a scroll forever and ever in some combo with their mage. I mention this because it IS an available feature to purchase these Plunder Packs using the in-game currency (gold). It is also an available feature to purchase the in-game currency of gold using real money, however it should be noted you are only then gaining access to one-use-only spells, none of which are the advanced spells and which you should recieve a somewhat constant supply of just by playing the game.In addition to regular Plunder Packs, there are Golden Plunder Packs. These give access to higher quality scrolls (so nastier spells) and have a chance to drop artefacts (the games spelling, not mine), which is basically an item that can be used in crafting to make a special type of scroll that is permanently available. This crafting has some random chance and quality aspects tied into it, making it quite an interesting feature. Golden Plunder Packs are available for purchase using real money, but again, can be obtained just by playing the game.It should REALLY be noted, that while all of the above mentioned mages cost extra cash to get hold of, the maximum party size allowable in the game is three mages at once. In theory, should you figure out which three you like best, or figure out you do NOT like the style of one or more mages, you can save yourself some easy money.Long story short, this is definitely worth the four bucks, even if you do not purchase any extra stuff. I would have expected this game to sell outright for more than the developer is charging, given that plenty of games expect ten dollars outright."
,Not Recommended,440330,21676769,"Posted: 6 March, 2016",all,Imhoteph,"I disregarded some of these negative reviews for a few reasons:1. Being a long-time fan of WHFB and WHFRP2. Supporting a norwegian software development companyI really wanted to like this, and was hoping that the negative reviews were nothing more than pay2win haters, and I personally dont mind spending more time in a game ""grinding"" to unlock things. It just gives me a reason to keep playing.It's a ridiculously cheap game, and I guess you get what you pay for in several ways.However, many people are used to getting a lot more for their money than this.At 3.4hrs played, Im currently towards the end of the first chapter (7/8 missions) - This is almost half-way through the content that comes with the initial purchase of the game.Without buying additional wizards, you will then have 2 wizards to put on the battlefield, and one empty slot. At the end of the Elven chapter, (The first 8 missions), you will receive the elven sorceress. At the end of the second chapter (Chaos Wastes), you receive a Chaos Sorcerer. Although you can only field 3 of your 4 wizards at that point. There are about 5-6 other wizards available, but only if you pay $ to unlock either the battle missions, or the character itself. At the time of writing this review, there is only 1 extra chapter to buy, which I guess will make for very limited gameplay, with little replayability.The crafting and spell system seems difficult to comprehend, even for myself with intimate knowledge of the winds of magic schools, and the Warhammer universe lore.Combat/difficultyThe game let's you loot warpstones at a steady pace, and you will find yourself constantly using these to revive your fallen wizards after being pummeled to death by various spells/melee abilities.So, with this in mind, I cannot honestly recommend this to others, and I can only provide the following advice to the game creators:1. Increase the initial price of the game to say $10- Make it possible to purchase the in-game characters for gold, and also ensure that there is a way to gain gold by repeating missions.2. Add a lot more characters to be played and customized by the players.- E.g: Witch Hunters, Templars, Dwarven warriors etc.- You should be able to create an adventuring party with a few different types of characters (Yes, I know this would not be true to the original boardgame, but you now have all the game mechanics avaialble to support both ranged and melee combat)3. Remove the scroll of binding, it's just not very realistic and a poor crutch in place of having a more diverse group of playable characters. It gets monotonous to sit and cast fireball and lightning bolt 10 times per battle.4. Make the battlefields a larger, it is currently very limited space to move around and utilize the ranged abilities in conjuntion to the enemy movement points.5. Add levels and experience to allow players to equip magical items, and inprove their stats as you grow in strength.6. Keep up the good work. The lore is fantastic, as well as the potential for this title."
,Recommended,440330,21778675,"Posted: 11 March, 2016",all,Azanthriel,For the $4 I paid I find this to be a fun turn based game which I am still trying to get my 100% achievements on. The game is not the best graphics but good enough for the price and enjoyment of the game. You do have to keep tactics in mind and know what your enemies abilities are. One spell out of sequence can make a difference.You find spells and warp stones (which can raise/heal you) during the course of a battle via drops. I have had chest and warp stones drop every battle and the elusive Golden Chest drop every so often (but rare enough.) The drops do have a three turn spawn life so make sure to grab them before they disappear.I have completed all available missions and have bought no chest (not even for gold) or wizards. I have acquired from drops every single spell up through mythic in multiple quantities. I have easily been able to keep a good warp stone supple (if you run short play the first chapter again to replenish.) And have found even mythic artifacts.Now in order to get 100% achievements I see no way to accomplish that without buying the DLC (and that is just 1 achievement.) And this may be an oversight on my part but it looks to me that the DLC is required for 100% achievement. I have also run into an occasional bug that once you win an arena you can not exit the field so you have to quit and do that battle over again.

This game is not ca$h $hop heavy (regardless of how it may appear) and there is no need to buy anything (except you'll want the DLC which is fantastic and provides the best maps and challenge in the game for $2.99) nor do you even have to grind areas to gain the gold to unlock the spells and such- Everything was unlocked for me with  no ca$h $hop useage (again, except for the DLC) and a regular playthrough.This is a really fun and solid tactics game- One of the closest digital versions of playing a miniatures game ive ever seen. it ""feels"" tabletop, fromthe rulesets to the encounters. The graphics on the characters and monsters even have a sort of painted look to them and some of the monsters look fantastic.The game itself is very simple to learn but yields alot of complexity in tactics- The first campaign is esssentially a tutorial and is very easy but about halfway through the second campaign everything really starts to come together and there are some challenging parts- Not frustrating or hard exactly, but you will need to use your brain.Game is fairly short and I would imagine you can beat both the main game and DLC in well under 15 hours.I feel that for what I paid ($3,99 for the game and $2.99 for the DLC) I got more than my moneys worth- was a great purchase. Anyone who gives this a real chance and like fantasy tactics games should probably feel the samew."

Can buy if you want to; totally unneccessary - you can win the game with 0 scrollsThrough regular play, found every scroll - drop rate is fine.Also, purchasable chests dropped 5 times during normal game and are completely unneccesary to win.Some enemies can move and attack across entire battlefield, some can't; use tactics (like shield and knockback).I never noticed inconsistent dice rolls - sure, RNG deals some bad hands sometimes, but there is a 1:216 chance for 3 1s in a row, so I expect this.Someone mentioned raising the price and including the DLC - I disagree with this. I wouldn't have played if it were $10+. I'd buy the extra levels (if I could do it without Steam Wallet - havent used for anything else and Steam restricts minimum you can load it with) because I enjoyed the first part, but probably won't buy extra characters - some people will. I like that the devs leave it up to the player's preference.All in all, it plays pretty much like the old Warhammer tabletop game with heavy, tactical combat.For $4, core game is fun - cheaper and better than a movie. If you like tactical combat games and tabletop adaptations, give it a try. If you really like it, buy an extra wizard or two and support the dev team"

76561198048769900,Recommended,440330,34188054,Posted: 12 August,all,Sovog,I like the game. It is turn base strategy combined with cards which u use to cast spells. You can select 2 spells by your own choice which you take for battle. Basic spells on wizard are for free plus you can purchase additinal spells for in game credits.You play on a larger map where you move and when you are ambushed by enemies it changes to close arena so you cannot run alll over the map and must fight them in excact place. Still it allows you enough space to manuever and if you calculate your spell cost and moves correctly its not so hard to win.So if you like turn base strategies I can recommend this game.And you must buy deluxe edition to have all wizards and additional content (to avoid in game microtransactions)!
