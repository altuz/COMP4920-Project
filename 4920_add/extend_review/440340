76561198058156743,Not Recommended,440340,21575288,"Posted: 1 March, 2016",all,Inspector Dosh,"Just so we're clear, this is just my first impressions after about 1 hour of play give or take so if I happened to miss anything from here, I am probably blind as a bat or I haven't reached that far into the game yet.First off, this is a game built on the Unity engine so looking at the options menu, it's no big suprise that it's usually bare bones starting off with the graphical settings. All you got is resolution that's fixed to your native resolution and can't change it unless you go into windowed mode, toggling realtime shadows on or off, and some basic form of Anti-Aliasing with the absence of graphical presets, but this game is not very demanding as far as I can tell. For sound, it's just the master volume, no sliders for voice, sound effects ,or music. Languages consists of English and Japanese, with the last one is basically swears with the ability to upload any language of your choice. The help menu is written in broken English, but it's not broken enough to not get the message it wants to say.The gameplay is an on-rails shooter in a third-person perspective, so don't expect a third-person cover shooter. Looking at the game's screenshots, the UI in-game, and the way to navigate the menus, I have realized this game is a mobile port, but does it really affect the gameplay all that much? To me, not really except some design decisions that happen to get through. There are quite a bit of weapons to take with you on the field, but down the later levels, it really feels like they are just direct upgrades from previous weapons you were currently using and when you select a weapon, it has a button labeled upgrade so I originally thought I could alter stats to make the guns more interesting and make early game weapons still viable to use late game until I realized it's only to increase your ammo reserves since buying the weapon itself only comes with one spare magazine for some odd reason. Honestly it would be tolerable if there was a way to switch weapons at will instead of throwing away your entire primary reserves only to be left with a pea shooter. As an on-rails shooter, it unfortunately suffers the same problems as that god awful Rambo game with no warning markers to tell you if you're going to get hit, but instead of fixed health, you have regenerating health so it becomes less noticably infuriating, even though you still get hit occasionally behind cover. The gunplay feels pretty weak with no visual recoil on the guns with fairly poor sound assets in addition to janky animations almost convincing me that the guns were pre-packaged Unity assets and I say that because I am someone who really enjoys games from Tripwire Interactive. Speaking of recoil, there is no recoil to even speak of because it is actually on a set cone of fire that shoots in random directions so don't even think about trying to control said recoil. Occasionally, they will spawn melee units that instantly kills you for some inexplicable reason since I don't recall melee units in rail shooters instagib players at all, no, I can't think of a single one that does that. The levels themselves are pretty short considering this is a mobile game and it is deliberately designed to force you to replay levels over and over again to get enough money for the gun you need and the ammunition required to pass the level only to repeat the process again in return artificially extending the game longer than what the actual length is.Perhaps I just have really low standards nowadays, but $6 is an okay price for what this is. Verdict? I can't really find myself recommending it to just anybody really and I kinda feel bad for saying it. I'd only recommend it for those who has the time and cash to burn, but not for those who are desperate for on-rails shooters. If you are looking for on-rails shooters, take a look at Blue Estate and Typing of the Dead: Overkill. Or better yet, Go to an arcade outlet and find Time Crisis 3."

Regardless, the game is great like the price.' b-but u onlly have 0.2 hourssssss ',  I know. Don't get me wrong, I love the game as much as I love Xeno's mods. But Jesus Christ, is this game difficult. It's like playing Portal without having any knowledge on puzzles. I can't even get past the second level after the tutorial without dying.Again, still great. Especially since this is Xeno's first game. But I do expect more games in the future Xeno, a lot more. Hopefully in Banzai Escape 2, ( if you even decide to make it ), it's a third person shooter. :')Also, my personal fav achievement is ' Rokiahi N00b '. Mostly because it's describing me."

,Recommended,440340,23920796,"Posted: 29 June, 2016",all,lA0l 青,"Banzai Escape isn't a good game but it's not that bad either, it feel likes the game maybe has been at first develloped as a mobile game then it was ported as a PC steam game (because of the HUD and all the point and click stuff instead of a proper keyboard binding).Gameplay :Banzai Escape is rail shooter where you go from cover to cover and shoot anything that move, it's very simple yet effective but way too easy, sometimes the IAs are so stupid that they reload whitout being covered, also when you change cover, they continue to shoot the cover where you were instead of where you are. Also the only real threat are explosives, and being short on ammo (you can buy more ammo for your weapon so buy a lot if you want to finish most of the mission). I mean, the explosives are the only thing that can really kill you quikly, and if you waste all your ammo you lose. Now lets talk about the controls : you can move the character by yourself since it's a rail shooter, you can only make her move from one cover to another and make her aim or not. Also you can't swap between your pistol and your main weapon, so sometimes you are contraint to finish your mission and the boss with your pistol instead of killing the small fries with the pistol. The last bad point is the laser part : there is a mission where you have to dodge some lasers, the partern are very easy to gasp but the control are terrible : you have to use your mouse to move Rokiahi and that's just painfull to do, that's where you can see it's a mobile game : maybe it's easy to do with a touch screen but on pc it would be way better if it was controlled by the keyboard. One last thing : do not play the game with the heavy rifle, it's way too easy with that weapon, because even if you can't shoot with that while being covered, it deals so much damage that you will kill anything before it have the time to do anything.Art and graphics :it's very average but I comming from a unity based game I guess it's okay. It's not that ugly, and honestly, it could have been way worse. Also you have character customisation but it's very limited but it's worth to mention.Sound and musics :Well, it's nothing exceptional either, the sound design is okay (even if it lack variety but coming from an indie game it's okay) and it even have voice acting (which is pretty bad but they made the effort to do so, so it's a good point). The musics are okay but forgivable.Story :That point is confusing, at the start of the game you are just thrown into the action without any intro and you do not really understand why you are here. You only apprehend the story at the end of the game and overall, coming from a game like that, they didn't made a bad job, it's okay (the end is wtf though)Summary :Pros :- Voice acting- Funny game if you are boredCons :- Can't switch between your pistol and your main weapon- the part where you have to dodge the lasers50/100 If only steam had a ""balanced"" bouton. It's not that bad, nor it's good but it's worth taking a little look into that, yet I don't recommand you to buy it at full price because it's really short (2H and half)."

,Recommended,440340,22290157,"Posted: 7 April, 2016",all,Clicky,"This my first review on a game so I do apologize if anything sound off.Banzai Escape is one of those games that you need to honestly think about before getting it. It's an on rail shooter so no third person free control sadly. However, once you start to get into the game long enough you will not mind that it's a rail shooter. Most of the time you will feel like you're playing an arcade game once you get all the upgrades the game has to offer.The first time you play the game it's going to be difficult ofcourse, and the starting weapons are going to be♥♥♥♥♥ but if you can make it to the last level of the game you will have the best weapons in the game. You can also upgrade the cosmetic looks of both your character and two of the main bad guys.From start to finish I beat the game alittle over four hours, again once you have the best stuff in the game you can beat the game in alittle under half an hour...i'm serious. There is replay value surpisingly, once you beat the game you can try and beat it without dying, test the weapons in levels that you didn't have at the time OR...one of the games weirdest yet funniest replay values called (Rokiahi Madness). Lets just say it dramaticly changes all of your characters subtitles into...questionable thoughts as to what game you were playing in the first place.All in all the game is worth a try if you were thinking of buying this arcade like game."

You are fighting an *Evil orgonization whos 2 main people are anime style characters.3. You shoot with guns.4. 4 different enemy types.5. Laser gun that you get after beating last boss, is OP6. Last boss is a SPIDER TANK, that shoots lasers has a super cannon and fires slow moving granades.-Cons1. Cover to cover shooter, can't choose where to go, only between 2 covers (Even that rarely)2. Models and animations aren't very good, but they are OK.3. Voice acting isn't too good ether, and the story is lacking.4. Game does a bad job of explaining what to do in some places.5. Laser gun that you get after beating last boss, is OPPersonally, I would only buy this game if it is on sale for at least [-30%] If not, don't waste your money.* = Not really, in some places there are hints of them being the good guys."

MP53.When Ina boss  use the attack helicopter and attack player from behind it so hard change cover becauce minigun can attack two way and rohiaki have been kill quickly it make me feel needs luck to survive.4.Some camera view rather bad, so make more problem in 3.5.Black screen story when finish level. I'm think you should make it likes cutsecne after finish defend lobby level.6.The pistol should be damage for Centurian boss. many player maybe haven't enough ammo for the first play.So make bad feeling must restart when near finish level.7.Should have cutsecne after end cedit.I'm expect player want to know what after and next intend herself about this case. not abruptly ending.Maybe this game have a lot of defect but interesting system design, Boss system look rather challenge and enjoy to play (P.S. but for use some gun)For the first pulice I'm think this game is Not bad but I'm not recommend my friend to buy it. Even my close friend have interesting ""MOE military girls"" still undecided.how even I'm wish you have next project on steam. :DI'm give 5/10 SCORE for this game."

,Recommended,440340,35074164,Posted: 19 September,all,Momokii?,"You can clearly see that this is a low budget game. The story and characters are nothing but a big cliche. The voice acting is bad. There are sections in the game which have infuriatingly bad controls (I'm looking at you, laser room). And it's very short.So, why do I still give it a thumbs up?Because most imprtantly I had a lot of fun playing this game. It also has something that most AAA games don't have: it was made with passion. What's also surprisingly good for a low budget game are the character models and animations. It felt like they put a lot of time into creating them. I generally liked the character design in this game. As cliched as they were, the characters are very likeable, especially the main character who I personally adored. The level design was a bit questionable at points but offered a lot of variety. Ironically I wish they stretched out some parts of the game. The music also wasn't bad at all. So despite all the cons, this is a pretty solid and enjoyable game. It's not the best game ever made or a GOTY candidate, but most definitely exceeded expectations.I'll be waiting for Episode 2!"
