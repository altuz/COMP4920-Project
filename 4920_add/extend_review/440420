,Recommended,440420,28078454,"Posted: 29 November, 2016",all,Chudah,"When I heard people raving that True Fear is a truly scary hidden object game, I chuckled a bit as I added it to my basket of electronic goodies.  I've played ""scary"" HOGs before, and they're usually no more frightening than a child's campfire story.  So when I finally got around to firing the game up, I'd done so  expecting little more than a mildly amusing spooky tale with decent adventure-lite gameplay that would at least satisfy my craving for HOGgy goodness.   What I got was something more.  Much, much more.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=807123647Before I delve into the review, one must ask the question, how can a game elicit a fearful response from the player when the threat of death is completely absent?  This same question is often brought up with many horror point and click adventure titles, some of which have managed to sufficiently unnerve me; and I will tell you this, the horrors of a man's heart is far more terrifying than a monster that wants nothing more than to eat you.As appearances go, True Fear may look like your standard HOG, but is in essence a very solid point and click adventure title, provided you play on Expert with no hints, skips or highlighted areas.  Yes, there are hidden object scenes (quite difficult ones, actually), but you can toggle between them and simplified adventure puzzles where you use items in the scene to ultimately retrieve the tool you'll need.  These alternate puzzles help keep with the adventure feel of the game, something hidden object scenes often interrupt (a common complaint among HOPA critics).http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=808888993Outside of the in-game environments, the CGI movies are fairly high quality.  While the graphics won't hold a candle to any triple A game we've seen in the last 15 years (or even most indies), for a HOPA they're quite impressive.  What's even more impressive is how the action is framed, utilizing camera techniques drawn from horror films to instill fear and unease.  Sound, pacing and music all give these scenes a cinematic feel, even if the characters move a bit stiffly with limited facial expression.  How you present the material makes all the difference in the world.The best gameplay and graphics mean little without a compelling narrative to pull you in, and this is where True Fear shines.  The way the mystery unfolds with each reveal leading to more questions as details build to an even greater mystery, it keeps you digging.  The first in a three part series, I have several suspicions as to what happened, but only scraps of proof to back my theories.  In the end, I could be totally wrong, but puzzling out the story is part of what makes the game so damn enjoyable.  And that story is even darker and more twisted than I expected.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=808508929Of particular note are the bonus materials that open upon completion of the main story.  Aside from the bonus chapter, which I absolutely suggest playing through as it oozes creepiness while adding a ton of clues to the overall storyline, you'll want to look through the developer's extras for interesting insights into how the game was made as well as things that were cut for story-related purposes.  This is one of the few times I've felt the bonuses are indeed worth looking through.Have I interested you in the game yet?  True Fear is in its own league, transcending the genre in storytelling and presentation while at the same time remaining grounded in familiar conventions that dedicated fans so love.  If you were ever mildly interested in hidden object games, this is a great title to wet your feet in.  As for HOG and adventure game veterans, it's a MUST play!  You have been warned..."
,Recommended,440420,31776555,Posted: 15 May,all,DragYn,"Recommended? Yes, definite thumbs up from me.True Fear: Forsaken Souls is part 1 of a (planned) trilogy of HOG-style adventure games. I refer to it as ""HOG-style"" because the HOG scenes are less hunt and click random items, and more of a chain of cause and effect. You need a piece of tape to fix a wire that gives power to a light that shows a code that you need for a safe etc etc etc - all within the same small scene.  The first one of these puzzles took me back a bit, and I was almost disappointed. But, as I progressed, these puzzles felt a bit more logical and natural vs your standard fare.The rest of the game is pretty standard static-scene adventure gaming.  The puzzles were generally logical and the use of the map function made hopping from room to room easy.  I did get stuck a couple times, but it was mostly due to my own idiocy in missing something very basic.The setting is creepy and dark, but not overtly frightening.  A run down house (actually, 2)with a cemetary in the basementand an abandoned asylum (bonus chapter) make up the locations.  Typically, the scenes/rooms are fairly static, with some mild animations like bugs skittering across the wall, or lights flickering.  But interspersed throughout the story are short cinematic scenes (again, fairly typical - though decent quality) that added to the horror element.  It is in these that a few jump scares and PG gore would occur.  My 10 year old son watched me play and got startled at the jumps, but nothing that gave him nightmares or anything.All-in-all, if you enjoy the Artifex Mundi games but want something a bit darker and more forboding, this is for you.  $15 may be a touch high for the time you'll spend, but the game itself is worth the price.  If you find it half-off or better, it's a must-buy IMO."

,Recommended,440420,32209368,Posted: 5 June,all,Mintea,"I definately recommend this game for anyone who likes Point and Click adventures and a horror atmosphere. The game sets itself up very well to make it feel super creepy, without the overuse of jumpscares most other games use (I think there is only one or two in the entire game).Downsides:- The main character's face naver changes, so she's the biggest mood killer in cutscenes. She doesn't even scream or show fearwhen discovering her sister's corpse or with the mannequin under the sheet.- Very easy to not know where you're supposed to go, so there is a LOT of back tacking between rooms. At least the map helps this a bit.- Due to how dark and gritty the game's supposed to be, some things like items or puzzles can be overlooked. Leading to the issue above.- I had two puzzles not work for me, forcing me to skip them despite the solution being right.Those were the Hand Puzzle in the box and the Star Puzzle in the book.Despite this the game was supper fun and I plan on having my brother have a go during our October Fright Fest."

76561198144919033,Recommended,440420,29024604,Posted: 4 January,all,turkthesnake,"This is a casual point-and-click HOPA (Hidden Object Puzzle Adventure) game. It is the first installment in a trilogy. If you like the genre and you like creepy stories, you are pretty much guaranteed to like this game.For the rest of the world: the thing that makes this game stand out is the story line. It isn't just the story itself, but the way it unfolds. It delivers a spook factor without resorting to gimmicks or gore. There is also a clever humor in the details (for example, at one point there is a book called Emblem Furniture: Where to Buy It, because no one actually owns a drawer that you lock by removing a piece of its carved surface)The game comes from a very small indipendent developer. The second installment in the trilogy has been delayed, literally, years. But the hype hasn't died down. There is a large devoted following that is willing to do crazy things like repurchase the game on Steam simply to support the small operation (even though the developer warns that there is nothing to warant the re-purchase). That should give you an idea of how special this game is.If you are looking for a big budget horror game, you'll probably be disappointed. But if you are looking for a well-crafted, casual, spooky experience for a rainy afternoon, look no further."

,Recommended,440420,30513633,Posted: 14 March,all,melancholyorchid,"I essentially played this game nonstop including the bonus content and I do not regret one second of it. It was tough, it had lots of achievements to make me feel good about my progress, it had a pleasing art style, and the cutscenes were legitimately creepy. My recommendation is that if youre using headphones, have the volume VERY low when you first start and then adjust it, because the start screen of the game itself is very loud. Also, dont skip the cutscenes or use any hints if you value getting all of the achievements. My only con about this game is that the scary parts of the cutscenes are somewhat dull because the actual evil thing (dont want to give anything away) looks rather fake and cheesy and odd. Aside from that I loved this game so much."

The puzzles are not particularly difficult and there is an option to skip them all together if you just want to move through the story without dealing with them.  It is somewhat short in terms of hours of gameplay, but on sale at $10.49 it is well worth it and probably still worth it for the full sticker price.Like most story driven games of this genre, there's no real replay value in the game so if that's important for you,  this isn't the game for you but, then again, most of this entire genre probably isn't the kind of game you're interested in if that's a deal breaker for you."

Cummings)Sometimes, one great story can change everything. But with Goblinz, it isn't just the story (written by the team leader, Dimmie Azu), but also how the story is being told and shown. There is definitely something new and better in what they do. True Fear is an engaging and immersive experience, very different from what the developers of casual games have offered so far, making us feel surprisingly close to Holly, the main character, almost experiencing her fears and anxieties.There are so many questions left unanswered in True Fear we could talk about this story for hours. Goblinz deliberately chose what not to show (because, as they have already explained, to give away too much information would spoil the impact of the revelations). Since they work like professional writers, strategically placing the bread crumbs for us to follow, I am sure that in the end everything will make sense. They show us just a hint of a tail knowing we will realize a cat awaits us. Goblinz are special because everything matters, because everything was carefully planned and beautifully executed.I've played the first game and looked at the screenshots and cut scenes so many times that now and then I felt inside the house, trying to find out what had happened and trying to decide where to go. No other game had this effect on me. I wonder if I admire it so much because it feels like a movie – one that would make Hitchcock very proud of his influence! And it feels like a movie based on a great book/a best seller - so much that it makes us long for the full immersion of VR. I hope Steam will be interested in taking the next step, making the player experience the game as Holly (or other characters) using VR - and how could we refuse the opportunity to see the world through her eyes, even as dangerous and frightening as it may be? I just love the way the trailer of the sequel whispers: ""Let me take you to a time before Hell broke loose""...I truly believe Goblinz has a bright future waiting to unfold and that Dimmie is a creative genius, as well as a fully committed professional. May he always feel “young”, “fearless and thirsty”."

I really do. I wish the puzzles were hard, I wish it was scary, I wish the story gripped me and I wish the animation wasn't so god awful.But the puzzles are not hard, the game wasn't scary (and loud jumpscares where it's suddenly quiet right before the grudge girl jumps out at me with full volume does NOT class as scary. That's lazy and cheap), the story didn't grip me and the animation was probably the scariest thing about it.The heroine will break a window with a crowbar, throw it away and then go, ""Drat! I need a crowbar to pry off these nails!"" literally 10 seconds later.Pick up the crowbar you just had, maybe?She also complains about touching a fridge full of cobwebs to the point I need to find a feather duster for her, but will later pick up the severed, bloody hand of somerandom guyand won't bat and eyelid, or even ask for gloves. She'll see some leaves on a step and go ""You know what? Ineeda tool to get rid of these leaves."" even if she could use her hands. The game creates tasks for the sake of it. And it isn't very hard to realise what goes where.Most importantly, the developers of this game are possibly the worst developers I have ever seen/encountered. This game, originally was on Big Fish Games, and I played that 3 years ago, roughly. The sequel, of a three part series, was meant to be out in 2015.The developers keep delaying it's release and give terrible reasons, claiming that it's super rare and unexpected ANOTHER delay has happened. This is possibly one of their most popular games and now only three people in the company are even working on it. Their Facebook is dead, everything is dead. They go off the radar for MONTHS and leave fans confused and expectant, only to tell them 5 months later that something else weird and improbable has happened that has delayed it further.It's getting to the point I'm impressed this game even exists, since a second is clearly too difficult for them to fabricate. This game ends on a cliffhanger. A big one that had me invested years ago. It is not a game you want or will bother to wait 3 years for.The achievements are also a big issue with this game. The main achievements ask that you finish it in expert mode, which has no hints and unskippable puzzles and hidden object screens which you must complete in less than 2 minutes. There are 34 of them. You must complete all of them in less than 2 minutes. That itself isn't exactly easy. You also cannot skip cut scenes, credits or ignore pieces of the stories in the form of notes scattered around the place. And the worst one?You must complete the game in one sitting. You cannot exit the game once you begin it. That INCLUDES the DLC with it.This, if you're lucky and good at these games, will take you 6 hours. This took me 6 hours and I've played this game in the past numerous times, so I'd like to think I'm an old friend to it.Some people, who don't have lives like me, may be thinking, ""Well that's fine, that's doable. I like playing these games in one sitting. I'm sure I can play expert and get all these parameters.""Well, that's where you're wrong, kid.I got two hours in, and the game decided to crash on me when I paused it to go get a drink.My PC is worth £1.5k. It can handle a lousy point and click game easily. And because this useless game decided to add impossible achievement standards, I had to restart it from the beginning, because otherwise I wouldn't get the achievements. And that's arguably a huge part of even playing point and click games.The worst achievement ties all of these achievements into one. It requires you ""max out"" the game in one sitting, or you don't get it. I missed this achievement by 1 collectable figurine out of 12, with every other 37 achievements being popped and achieved.I have to restart the entire thing because collectables do not carry on from other games and it will not accept an incomplete or not-perfect run.I have never been angrier at a game, and I'm sat here at 2am telling the internet because I'm so angry.I don't even care that it's £1.79 right now, don't waste your money."

I hope part II is a success and we finally see more games like that. Developers, please set us free from the candy unicorns!I have played this game more than once and I really enjoy the story. It has twists and turns, you visit different places (with a purpose, not just for play time) and it actually makes sense, which is really hard to say for more than a handful of games. There are quite a few of us that await patiently the next part of the trilogy (patiently, for years I must add) and this is saying something.It is not particularly gory, but it is scary. But you have to actually play it, if you skip everything and just rush the game you'll miss half the fun. The voice actors do a great job.It run greatly on Vista, with a glitch or two on Win10. I would prefer it if I could lock the toolbar up."

,Recommended,440420,35109266,Posted: 21 September,all,hojo,"Enjoyed Act 1 a lot. Act 2 got REALLY tedious. Like, come on already.A couple jump scares...underwhelming. Sure it had a few creepy parts but the scary girl looked so CG it wasn't scary at all, it was mostly comical. I kept waiting for the scary, but they never delivered, but they had a good setup for it!Was it worth the 70% off price of $2 and some change that I paid for it? Heck yes! Would I pay full price for this? Heck no! And I was like ok let me check out the CONTINUATION game...oh wait, you mean, years later it's still not out? So, I guess I just never get to figure out what this whole entire first installment was leading up to? Cool, thanks guys. Tip: don't release a game in parts unless you're QUITE SURE you'll have those other parts out in a reasonable amount of time, otherwise, just wait until it's all ready to release at once, OR end the first part with a somewhat satisfying ending so in case the other parts don't happen, at least the players won't be TOO annoyed. But this was literally left on a cliff hanger leading into the next zone, basically.Also,Why can't you just brush off some leaves with your hand?AND TELL ME HOW A DICTIONARY HELPS YOU TRANSLATE ANCIENT LANGUAGES??!I'll give it a recommend simply due to the fact that it was a horror HOG which you don't find all that often(Theatre of the Absurd is the only other horror HOG I even know of, which I also recommend) and as far as Hidden Object Games go, it was decent, and while it is not a full game, there are many COMPLETE HOGs that are shorter than this, but I ONLY recommend this game if you get it on sale for less than $3. But then...I don't buy any HOG for more than $3 lol."

Problem is, with psychological horror games, you rarely buy the story: often unbelievable, with too many beasts or monsters everywhere and other incredible things .. Playing True Fear: Forsaken Souls Part 1 made me come around as the experience was breathtaking for someone usually disliking the genre. I would never have imagined myself saying this of such a game but the fact is that the very positive rating is well-deserved!At first glance I thought it would be a little casual Hidden Objects Scenes game. I bought it while I was sick, my brain was out of order and I wasn’t in a mood for big challenges such as those you might deal with in other adventure games. I was therefore expecting a boring story driving me from HOS to HOS and nothing else.  Unexpectedly I got quickly hooked to the plot and I found myself deeply immersed in the complex story of an intriguing game!My guess is, people who were disappointed and wrote negative reviews are supposedly:1/confirmed adventure gamers.. to whom this game might have seem pretty easy. And that’s true, it’s fairly casual and thus not extremely challenging.OR2/people looking for real horror, jumpscares and such.. which this game does not deliver. There is only psychological horror as the story beyond is staggering and making you feel uneasy, but the playthrough itself is somewhat peaceful. There are no “run for your life” or whatsoever.OR3/ classic HOS fans.. for this game isn’t a classic HOS. Be aware that there are not classic HOS at all in this game.Now let me state this about the so-called HOS scenes in True Fear/Forsaken Souls. Those are more interactive objects scenes involving actions such as “notice a key, grab it to open a box”, “find another item in that box that will operate something” else etc.. until you obtain something useful in the game. So, yes, it’s quite different from classic HOS and actually not bad at all. It’s way more dynamic then just looking for and clicking on objects written on a list. For starter there is no list or whatsoever. At the beginning of each “objects scenes” you’re clueless.So it’s definitely an adventure game, of the casual sort but a fair one. That means no hard puzzles and no long hours scratching your head, wondering what to do next. But a real plot and an interesting story.I wanted to write a review to give True Fear its fully deserved credit but I don’t want to say too much so I don’t spoil your playtime. All I will say about the plot you’ll learn it in the first 10 or 15 minutes of play.When I started this game, first things I noticed were beautiful graphics and shortly after, for once in a lifetime, no boring cutscenes! There are cutscenes but those are short, thrilling and totally in the plot. They’re not only here to make the game seem longer.Music is fine by me. Not pervasive. Discreet enough and sticking to the atmosphere: some piano and violin tunes. As well as voice acting and other game sounds: crows shrieking, soft whispers, doors slamming etc..In the 1st act of that 1st part, the atmosphere is somehow unpleasant, but I wouldn’t say frightening (no jumpscares). It’s very creepy.To say the least, at the very beginning you’re awaken by the mailman who brings you a letter in which you hear from your sister for the 1st time in ten years. She needs you so you directly come to her place. But instead of meeting with her you find yourself alone in an abandoned and lifeless house where the only living creatures are spiders, bugs, cockroaches and mice. The place is more or less dark.  Dust and cobwebs are everywhere. Broken things, empty frames and blood stains furnish the scenery and you can hear whispers amongst other unreassuring sounds. Everything points to a spooky atmosphere.Now you’re looking for answers to questions like why isn’t your sister here although she’s been asking you to come to that peculiar address. And all the questions rose by the bewildering things surrounding the house.Amongst things contributing to the very good feeling I have towards True Fear is the storyline: it is very solid. The progression of the thrill goes along with the pace of the game.Expect a thrilling suspense slowly growing as you find all sort of messages giving you clues and discover evidence of what might have happened. That thrill is well developed throughout the whole game.You’ll do many back and forth inside both main locations (in fact you’ll visit 2 houses) but these houses aren’t that big so it doesn’t affect the game.Second and third acts of this 1st episode take place in your grandparents’ house, where you used to live with your sister when being children. In that location there is light, less cobwebs or creepy stuffs. All in all it’s more alive but I found these acts far more scary than the 1st, from a psychological angle, due to the things you learn. There again, no jumpscares.There are few moments in the whole game when you could be unsettled, at most, but those moments are perceptible and the “surprises” easy to guess.I concede that not everything is brilliant in this game and there are still some downsides in the gameplaylike finding a light bulb in the fridge... The house is a mess, I admit, but please!Another thing I dislike is that it’s very linear but I think that goes with the development of the story and it’s a necessary evil not to ruin the plot.For the price, especially if on sale, you have to give it a try. I hope I made you want to see it by yourself and experience a great and awesome thrill.As far as I’m concerned I see it’s a sequel and I’m really looking forward to playing the next episodes!  After this first chapter my expectancies are high!!"

I enjoyed the cut scenes, but for me at least, they were quite a bit louder than the game itself.    If you don't like HOGs, you can play without them enabled.  I did play with them enabled and found them to be middle of the road.  Not too hard, but not too terribly easy, either.   None of the puzzles were particularly difficult, either.  The one thing I did notice though is that some of the puzzles, particularly the train track puzzle, will activate and allow you to start solving it, even if you haven't found the piece of track you need to finish it.  Overall, If you like this type of game and you like an mysterious and creepy story, I recommend this game."

76561198048453515,Not Recommended,440420,35065931,Posted: 19 September,all,cavemanlawyer7,Pretty standard point and click game but with nice mood an interesting enough developing backstory that you want to find out what happens in Part II.With that said this has got to be the most contrived game I have ever played. Its just a bunch of closed containers and you search either for a key or a way to break into the container. Once you find some ultra ancient mystical key that unlocks this magical box inside you find...... a can opener? And that can opener lets you open a container that contains a key to another container that has inside of it.... a screwdriver? If that weren't bad enough you leave the can opener and screw driver behind after using them and then several times later in the game you find new can openers and screw drivers just lying around. Was that first can opener that special that you put it in a mystical box?Some of the actions you must take are also just plain silly.  There's a toy airplane on the desk. I must turn on the fan to make it fly away to reveal a key behind it. Why couldn't I just move the toy with my hand? Lots of other secrets are revealed in a fake chance kind of way. I replace the missing piece on some object and that causes another object in the room to randomly fall down revealing a key.  The game just makes solving things seem random and pointless.What this game is lacking is ingenuity. Most games like this let you combine objects in interesting and non-obvious ways. This game has almost no combinations. You wander around picking things up and then putting them in their obvious destination.

There is NOTHING scary about this game at all, it's just walking around a house looking for hidden objects that you can use to open more objects to find more hidden objects.. only to open a door and find more hidden objects that help you open something else... over and over and over and over and over.It's tedius, not fun at all.

ARGH. - No, wait that didn't help after playing this for over an hour... ARRRRGHHHHHHHHH!

ARGH (again)CONTROLS & BUGS: 20 out of 20: Easily the highest part of my score because the controls work perfectly as intended, but this isn't exactly Mortal Kombat sort of controls we are talking about either.  - Still, I can't take points away here.  20 out of 20.GRAPHICS & SOUND:  The graphics and sounds are pretty good for this kind of game to be honest, and the sounds are certainly convincing and creepy.  Add in pretty decent voice acting, and this aspect of my scoring is pretty high at an 8 out of 10.  ...Too bad graphics wasn't worth 80% of my score and more important then the value and fun eh?
