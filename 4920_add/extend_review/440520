So before I even start getting into the thick of this review.... IT NO LONGER WORKS!Secondly, this is soooooooooo overpriced and does not work straight out of the box even when it did work.  It is not the answer to people trying to get 3rd party controllers to work over the Steam Link.  Its a very overcomplicated, overpriced, no longer working, badly coded program that the dev is trying to milk every last penny from these overpriced sales before its pulled for no longer being compatible.DO NOT BUY!NOTE TO STEAM:  I would hope that Steam re-enable the Bluetooth pairing option again on steam link OS, so that compatible controllers can be added once more without hassle.  God know why you had taken this away too in the latest update of your Firmware.  The steam controller is good, but terrible for FPS!"

I needed to force my Steam Link to send XInput to my PC instead of emulating keyboard/mouse.  VirtualHere for Steam Link enabled me to do so with ease.Long ReviewThe Problem: For some of my games, I use FreePIE to adapt gamepad input to the keyboard/mouse controls expected by the game.  FreePIE runs as a background process, while the actual game runs in the foreground and has focus.  I found that this mode of operation does not work well by default with Steam Link, mainly due to how the Link decides when to emulate keyboard/mouse (""Desktop mode"") versus when to send gamepad XInput signals.  From what I understand, the problem is that the FreePIE window needs to have focus in order for the Link to send the gamepad XInput signal, but to give focus to FreePIE, your game loses focus and you can't play until you take away focus from FreePIE again.The Solution: VirtualHere for Steam Link solved this problem for me.  As advertised,  VirtualHere made my PC think the controller was directly plugged in, but it was really plugged into the Link.  As a result, FreePIE was then receiving the XInput signals from my controller even though my game was full-screen in the foreground.Additional Notes: I originally downloaded the free VirtualHere client from the VH website, but I wasn't able to get it working.  After some digging, I found that the free client apparently only works with earlier versions of the Steam Link firmware.  My Link is running version beta 518, which requires the ""VirtualHere for Steam Link"" version of the client.  It's disappointing that the free VH client does not work with the latest Steam Link firmware, but I also read that the Steam version supports up to three controllers (versus the free version supporting only one), so there is some benefit to this version.  It would be helpful if the product description included some sort of note officially declaring that ""VirtualHere for Steam Link"" is the only VirtualHere client that will work with the latest Steam Link firmware.RockSmith 2014 compatibility:Unfortunately, RockSmith seems to have some issues with the Steam Link and VirtualHere.  VirtualHere recognizes the RockSmith guitar cable, but for some reason the PC seems to just get garbage signal from the cable.  I couldn't tune the guitar in-game or even calibrate the cable.  Also, the game audio doesn't make it to my TV for some reason.  There might be solutions to these problems, but I haven't taken the time to try and find them.  My advice is don't expect VirtualHere/Steam Link and RockSmith to work together out of the box."

,Recommended,440520,33549581,Posted: 14 July,all,Vivian James,"VirtualHere is a solution to a problem that shouldn't be a problem.  When it comes to the SteamLink, I think plenty of people have got some (deservedly so) harsh criticisms about the whole thing.  It seems like Valve pushed them out the door, and then left all the broken aspects broken.  If Steam ends up putting up one of these applications for wifi for the Steamlink, I wouldn't be surprised, because the Steamlink's wifi support is abysmal.  Anyway, on to this nugget...VirtualHere acts as a passthrough link to your PC, Steam Link tries to interpret USB controllers (though only supports the big vendor ones and of course the Steam controller).  But what if Steamlink doesn't have a driver for said USB controller?  Well it just kind of does nothing.  And that's been my frustration with the Steamlink for a while.  I'd seen the VirtualHere option in settings before, but didn't realize VirtualHere was a separate purchase software.  I was ""thrilled"" to find out that support for my generic USB devices was relegated to a $12 DLC (which has another $10 DLC to allow it to work with an unlimited number of devices).VirtualHere doesn't try to interpret the USB controllers, and instead creates a virtual USB hub on your computer.  Every device that's been set to be shared across the network will be broadcasted to the linked up Steam client.  After purchasing this DLC you need to restart the Steam Link so it can install the VirtualHere package.  Also you'll need to go to the Desktop for this, because of UAC.  Then in the settings just set whatever USB controller you want to use to be shared, and then play.  One of the nice things is that it remembers what devices you tell it to share, so you don't need to stop streaming every time, just hot plug the device in (provided you've shared it before), wait a few seconds and you can use it.Do I recommend this software?  Hell yes, I recommend this software, but begrudgingly because this should have been part of Steam from the get go.  Billions of dollars and Valve can't be bothered to properly support controllers, so they instead tell you to buy some external software to do their jobs for them?  Apparently games as a service ain't good enough reason to help the customer anymore.It's a really awful joke that I needed to pay $12 to use my SNES controller over Steam Link.  The adapter for that controller is a DirectInput USB device, since when are DInput devices not supported?"
76561197997029022,Recommended,440520,29341662,Posted: 18 January,all,Hardy U,"There are a lot of negative reviews for this product virtually all of which are tied to the reviewer not understanding what this software is doing.This is a rather specialized piece of software. Yes, it technically adds compatability for a lot of gaming devices. That is somewhat useful. But, it is not adding that functionality to your Steam Link. It is really just sending the USB traffic directly to the host machine instead of having the Steam Link send connections via other formats. This software acts as virtual USB Hub on your host machine emulating that the controllers attached to the Steam Link are actually directly attatched to the host machine itself.As that is concerned it is incredibly useful for particular setups, and only moderately useful for the rest. I will say I noticed significant input lag for graphically intense games when running my Steam Link in the ""Beautiful"" setting. I assume that is because the bandwidth is saturated with the graphics data and there is not enough bandwidth to handle the USB data as well.Where this comes in very handy for me is for emulation. I have added a number of emulated games to my host machine's Steam library and many of the emulators detect if a controller is connected and return to default keyboard commands if it is not. Because this software acts as if controllers attached to the steam link are directly attached to the host, the emulators see there is a controller and it just works.I also use joy2key to allow me to exit the emulators gracefully with controller combinations. This is another ascpect that can only be done with a directly connected game pad because of how Steam Link chooses to send the commands to the host.TL;DR: This is specialized software that happens to add flexability to your steam link. The price for this software is $20 cheaper than the software otherwise would cost (VirtualHere's website) though you can get a free client from them that allows bridging a single device (so a gamepad, but not a gamepad+keyboard+mouse). This software is a necessessity if you need directly connected controllers for any software you wish to run through your steam link."

I bought this software because, like anyone with any desire to play video games on PC, I would like to be able to use any controller I should choose WIRELESSLY.

Attempting to pair the Xbox One Elite Controller and wireless dongle failed after numerous attempts. Reinstallation led to further problems (e.g. infinite driver installation prompt). Trying to pair a run-of-the-mill bluetooth dongle also failed. Note that I followed the instructions closely, including step-by-step manuals provided by the community. My generall impression: This is little more than a wonky implementation of third party software that – while no doubt being useful on it's own – doesn't play along nicely with the Link.Advice to Valve: Consider an in-house solution for USB passthrough in the future. Especially since Link users are currently paying too much for a feature that should have been built-in from the get go."

For some reason quite a few games in my library would not work over Steam Link because of the emulation technique that Steam is using.  With VirtualHere I was able to get my Xbox Controller to work with those games; however, it does not fix the games where the Steam Controller itself is also broken due to this emulation technique since it does not show up as a device that can be shared via VirtualHere.  (Distance is one game for example where everything is seemingly broken, but it works just fine if you play it from your PC)I can't set it so it doesn't display as In-App in Steam, I cannot set it up to start automatically with Windows through the software (you would have to set this up within Windows itself) and what is even more troubling is that after purchase, the free one that you download from the website works just fine.  Completely seperate executable, doesn't run through Steam, and after purchase of the Steam version it can now see the link and works correctly.After some digging around on their forums I found that VirtualHere does not actually need to be run from Steam if you are using it with the Steam Link.  When the link starts streaming it handles all of that automatically and any USB devices that are set to be shared from the VirtualHere menu on the SteamLink will appear on the host PC.On a side note, something is fishy here with the usage of the client.Where/who is this artificial barrier of seperation of the VirtualHere site version and the VirtualHere Steam version coming from?  Apparently they are identical minus some background licensing.  Do note that it seems that the version of VirtualHere from their website will not work with the SteamLink anymore.  The SteamLink is only licensed to share 3 devices.  On the VirtualHere website they offer a 3 device license and an unlimited license; however, you cannot change the server license on the Steam Link.TL;DR;Recommend if you have games where the controller should work, but due to the Steam Link's emulation method, it does not.  (Games where you can play them just find with a controller at the PC, but when plugging the controller into the Steam Link and trying to play remotely it doesn't respond)Do not recommend otherwise because of the artificial paywall and some weird licensing going on.  Very weak on configuration and settings for the price.  See Controller Companion which has significantly greater customization, can be set to disabled being as In-App in Steam, has built in running on Startup, etc and its 2.99 USD.

,Recommended,440520,29430128,Posted: 22 January,all,von Meat,"This program solves a very specific problem for the Steam Link. Most non-Steam games added to your Steam library are not going to recognize your controller as an actual controller (it thinks it's a KB/mouse) - I'm guessing this is because the software isn't passing through the Steam API. VirtualHere can trick your PC into thinking that your controller is plugged directly into your PC. For me, that means I can use my Steam Link with my Xbox One controller to play emulators and games purchased through the Windows store (e.g. Gears of War 4, Killer Instinct). It looks like there might be some slight additional input lag with this setup, but it's minimal - this software works.VirtualHere offers their client for free on their website, but it seems that this version doesn't actually see your Steam Link on the network- you need to purchase this version for the Steam Link to work with it.There are quite a few negative reviews here suggesting that the software doesn't work. It shouldn't take you two hours to figure out if this software is going to work for you or not (you can see I've only got 0.3 hours on record) so I recommend doing like I did and purchasing it for yourself and quickly figuring out if it solves this particular problem for you. If it doesn't work, just get your refund.note: I recommend launching VirtualHere from outside the Steam interface cause if you minimize Steam Big Picture on your Steam Link, you're gonna see a full screen image of the VirtualHere client which is a bit annoying."
,Recommended,440520,34382114,Posted: 20 August,all,BSLeavingLasVegas,"Short Version: I needed something to make it so my Logitech M705 mouse could use Setpoint while on the Steam Link. The mouse sensitivity without Setpoint was way too low. This did the trick and there are no latency issues.Long Version: After trying several wifi adapters that either had terrible range or simply didn't work, I decided to snake some Cat5e from my desktop to my router. After doing this, I thought, ""why not hook up the Steam Link?"" A buddy of mine worked at the Valve factory in Chicago, where they assemble the Steam Link and Steam controllers, and he gave me one a while back. I didn't really use it much because my previous wifi speed was pretty bad, due to an outdated wifi adapter.The Steam Link quickly replaced my Chromecast. No longer was I restricted to using tab-casting to view Amazon videos. I could just fire up the Steam Link and watch things on my TV just as if I was sitting in front of my monitor. I used my roommate's discarded wireless keyboard and mouse for a while, but I missed having a 5-button mouse and I didn't want to have to rebind the controls for games just to play them on the Steam Link. So, I ordered a wireless Logitech K360 keyboard and M705 ""Marathon"" mouse.I quickly and easily got the keyboard and mouse unified and everything seemed great, but there was one major problem: the M705 mouse's sensitivity was very, very low compared to my Logitech G402 mouse that I use on my desktop. I didn't want to have to adjust the sensitivity in each game depending on whether I was playing on the Steam Link or at my desktop. The crux of the issue was that the M705 mouse wasn't recognized by my desktop when it was plugged into the Steam Link, meaning that I could not access Logitech's Setpoint software to change the M705's sensitivity closer to that of my desktop's G402 mouse.After looking around the web for a solution, I stumbled upon VirtualHere. I figured that, if VirtualHere didn't work, then I would just refund it. Thankfully, I didn't need to refund VirtualHere, as it works perfectly. Now, my desktop recognizes the M705 through Steam Link and it can use Setpoint. Another great thing is that Setpoint's settings are specific to that input device, meaning that changing the sensitivity for the M705 doesn't change the sensitivity for my G402.While it would be nice if the Steam Link intrinsically had something like VirtualHere, I'm just glad to find a solution to my dilemma. Now, my user experience on the Steam Link is the same as on my desktop and I couldn't be more pleased.It's a shame that VirtualHere either doesn't work well or doesn't work at all with some devices, but it has worked for my needs."

The negative reviews are just stupid because they are from people who don't know what this product is used for.What can be done with this? As the description of VirtualHere already tells you, it can trick a computer into thinking a controller connected to the Steam Link is connected locally to the computer via USB. This is extremely useful for a lot of people (like me) who use untypical controllers like the N64 or Gamecube Controller (for example for emulators). While these controllers work fine on the PC, they usually won't via Steam Link because of their untypical layout. With VirtualHere they do work with the Steam Link, because like I already said, it's like connecting the Controller directly to the PC via USB.I'm happy with the product. It worked out of the box. I started it, connected my N64 Controller and could use it as a normal USB Device. Took me less than 5 minutes to figure out.

I initiated the return process and was about to box it up, when I read about Virtual Here and thought it could be my saviour. I had recently built a racing cockpit as a DIY project, incorporating a Logitech G29 wheel, PS3/PS4, surround sound etc, and now that I have a powerful PC, it would work with that too. The problem is my cockpit lives in the man-cave, and the PC at my desk, the two are at opposite ends of the house and neither are very portable. Step-in the Steam Link, Virtual Here and a couple of powerline adapters. Within 20 minutes I was gaming at solid frame rates and console-smashing graphics from my man-cave, using my G29 wheel with no physical connection to my PC besides the mains electricity.This software is fantastic, to be honest it would really benefit from some instructions, or even a UI (the only thing I ever *saw* of VH was a small white window listing USB Hubs – of which the list was empty), but it does the job. I got stuck at first having read on the steam forum “go into the steam options > Virtual Here”, only to find this menu was missing, I later found there are two sets of options menus on the Steam Link, one being prior to connecting to the PC, and one being after (I am very new to the Steam Link! lol). Once I got my head around this, set-up was none-existent and I was on the tarmac in Project Cars in no time at all.It’s not my place to say, but I am confident a lot of the negative reviews are people who aren’t using it correctly. Read the Steam Forum for this software for the developer’s instructions on to get up and running with it and you’ll be fine. Plus for the price of a couple of pints – what is there to lose?"

The controller becomes unresponsive as it's then being used on the PC and it's impossible to navigate the steam link menu to select a game. You'd need a secondary proprietary controller that's not for use in any games just to navigate the menus for a game. Furthermore my xbox one controller refused to have any input working other then being recognize as an xbox one controller in device manager, when I plug it directly into my PC I have no issues using it for anything. I would not recommend this purchase as it's too expensive for what its simple use is for and limited to just the steamlink. If you're having issues with emulators don't turn to this, especially if you have xbox controllers, I was able to get a generic n64 USB controller to work however but it's just not practical for my use case."

First, with the recent update the software seems to work reliably. In the past, detection of peripherals was hit and miss. Unfortunately, the Steam Link specifications appear to be a little anemic depending the the type of controller you plan on using. At  this time, forget about using a race wheel unless you're okay with making sacrifices to steaming fidelity. I'm on a CAT5E Gigabit network. At 1080p with streaming quality set to beautiful I can hit 60fps all day long with a normal controller. The second I try to use a race-wheel (DFGT, G27, etc.), I begin to experience huge spikes in decode performance with noticeable jumping in the frames. I've tested this with Assetto Corsa, DiRT Rally, Richard Burns Rally, and Project CARS. With that being said, would I recommend the software in it's present state? Tentatively, yes.
