76561198055814197,Recommended,440550,25900330,"Posted: 7 October, 2016",all,Krauvando,"TL;DR --> Probably one of the best and most polished autoscrollers made out there, by a 3-people team that you can tell they've put their heart in this.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE SCAVENGER'S BACK!If you're reading this, I already like you. That means you're either in my friendlist or that you have a special and good taste in videogames.I've followed this game's progress around 2 weeks before its release. I never heard about it and after seeing how the game looked like, I told to myself ""oh boy, here comes a new potential gem"". For some odd reason, the game had an insane -40% discount on its RELEASE DATE. So I couldn't resist. But now I feel a bit sad because this game totally deserves the full price it has.RunGunJumpGun (RGJG) is a sci-fi autoscroller were only two inputs are needed: shoot forward and below (which causes you to float for as long as you keep shooting). Levels from this game are all very short but as you migh've seen from the trailer, most of them are also intense.Before I forget mentioning: this game is a lesson about how to make an autoscroller game. You can absolutely see all the beta-testing that has been made to every single level, so it works extremely accurate in what is planning. This is probably the greatest challenge when doing a game from this genre and RGJG completely outplays it.The game by itself is already tough (yet satisfying), but you can add an extra challenge if you decide to go for 100% completition. Each level has some little orbs called Atomiks, and the difficulty rises even more if you try to catch them all. In comparison to other autoscrollers (like BIT.TRIP RUNNER or Fermi's Path), Atomiks does NOT show the safe route, and some of them can completely change the difficulty of a single level from ""that level was trivial"" to ""holy hell what is this"".It has 3 Worlds, with 40 levels each one of them, plus a Bonus hardcore level that is unlocked if you collect all Atomiks from the previous 40 levels. So the length of the game is really fine and you won't feel like it's been a short experience, even considering that the levels are that small.Every World features a ""unique"" mechanic, due to being into different planets. I'm not going to spoil them, but let's just say that they're completely different between them and devs made a great job squeezing their use. When you play a level from World 2, you'll KNOW you're in World 2, it is that unique.And one more warning: you haven't played this game if you haven't played World 3. If you're here, it's because you like challenging games. Then I should tell you that World 3 is a complete out-lier. The previous ones are just the tutorial to prepare you. Good luck!---------------THE GOOD+ Extremely good visuals, that truly makes you feel inside the environment of the game. The game also runs super smoothly so no FPS problems.+ Music is AMAZING. I still have the tracks in my head. Please guys, support the composer (who's also one of the devs) by purchasing the OST for 2 bucks. And it also comes with extra tracks and some wallpapers! Really, together with the visuals, the music helps sooo much to make the game immersive.+ All levels, absolutely all of them, are super well thought and feels so good to find the path, with most of the times is pretty straight-forward, but sometimes it requires you to discover new uses of the game's mechanics.+ The mechanics, just as mentioned, are incredibly responsive. Once again I won't spoil them but trust me, devs didn't only programmed carefully the shooting and jumping/floating part. Every physics in this game truly feels natural.+ As I said, more that enough length for the game, with a total of 123 levels.+ Interesting achievements, which is always something entertaining.THE NEUTRAL· The difficulty curve is kinda relative. Sometimes I was stuck in a level for several minutes and the next one was super fast to beat, followed by another one tricky, and so on. But this is pretty subjective because some of my friends had troubles with levels I didn't. I can tell though that the last 11 levels from World 3 are all legit hard.THE BAD- Literally nothing. I've tried to think about something, but in my opinion this game just succeeds in everything it aims to. I found zero bugs, zero glitches, zero problems aside from my bad skills. Only awesomeness.OVERALLI'm so glad I found this game purely by accident (thanks to Twitter) because it's definately one of the best works I've played this year. I strongly, strongly recommend you all to try this guys, especially if you like this genre. I find it hard not to like OR love it."

,Recommended,440550,26637586,"Posted: 16 November, 2016",all,Vivi,"A hard, fair, and well-balanced arcade runner / platformer with some of the most brilliant level design I've ever seen. RGJG shows the creative limits of what a developer could do, level design-wise, in a simple game with just two buttons.The part of the game that makes you appreciate the level design even more is the collectables, though. Technically, you can complete each level just by getting from start to finish, but if you're anything like me, that half-аssеd playstyle will just leave you feeling unsatisfied. Instead, the game places a lot of collectables in the furthest, trickiest places possible, always making you take the difficult path, daring you to play the game in what is basically the hardest (but also most interesting) way possible. Good stuff.I'm not usually the collectionist type, but in this game it feels like the intended way to play.On top of that, the game constantly adds additional challenge by regularly pushing you out of your comfort zone with new mechanics and creative use of the aforementioned level design. One of the main reasons you keep playing the game is just to see what will the next level look like, as the content this game throws at you always feels fresh and never repetitive.Even though it's a game in a rather niche genre, RGJG still deserves a lot more love and recognition than it currently gets: I know for a fact there's tons of players who are up for the kind of challenges this game offers."

The graphics and music and effects are super colorful and powerful. There's also some interesting characters and story that pop up between levels.The game's also incredibly hard. I've been aiming for 100% completion, but maybe I should just settle for normal completion. It is very satisfying to beat the levels after dozens of attempts though."
,Recommended,440550,25300129,"Posted: 2 September, 2016",all,DooT,"This is the perfect combination of the brutality and addiction of Hotline Miami and the mindless, up down forward run and gun of Jetpack joyride!There are vivid visuals with a great sound track to match, each level feels unique and difficult, and collecting atomiks feels rewarding. There's a great mixture of well coreagraphed levels that look super difficult but play like a dream, and levels that look simple or easy and play like a trip through hell. The placement of collectibles is also impecibable and brilliantly thought out, being easy to spot and get close to but not actually obtain.A lot of fun is in the challenge of switching from forward-firing to jumping and back again.The main downside I've had is that some of the levels just feel like they take an eternity, and collecting bits does get a little repettitive. That being said, the story arcs bring a freshness and a bit of respite to these aspects and are both comedic and dark.Overall, 9/10, This is a great little game and totally worth the price that I would recommend to anyone."

,Recommended,440550,26557535,"Posted: 12 November, 2016",all,erkin,"Now I'm not one to write reviews often but I couldn't help but write for this one to show my appreciation. I got this game for pretty cheap during a huge discount and thus I didn't really have high expectations from it. In fact, I had second-thoughts about it because of the lack of Linux support. I expected it to be a run-of-the-mill run 'n gun platformer and got it solely because I liked the visuals in the screenshots and because people claimed it's hard. I was pleasantly surprised to see it's actually one of the best games I've ever played so far, despite having played only three hours. In fact, I feel like I already got the whole price's worth from just three hours.The story itself is quite simple, you're in a solar system with a dying sun and you're collecting trinkets called ""atomik"" to fuel your drive and get out of there. You can read about the lore/background in a neatly animated comic form on the game's own website but it's not like plot really matters in a gameplay-driven game like this.An interesting thing I have noticed is that the atomiks are placed in such a way that if you can plot a smooth curve that intersects all of them, you have the optimal path that avoids all obstacles and is oftentimes the safest path. This is a stark contrast in comparison to games where the bonus trinkets are placed in obstructively annoying places to challenge the gamer. Thus, it's actually hard not to get any atomiks at all in this game and considering you need to accummulate a certain number of them in order to access different sectors, it's a reasonable anti-frustration measure.Pros+ Attractive bleached, yet vibrant and psychedelic visuals. There aren't many games that make good use of this. It manages to make use of well-blending retro-style palettes whilst avoiding a distracting and happy-poppy look that would be jarring with its overall theme.+ Unexpectedly fitting trap/trip-hop soundtrack. I initially expected a distractingly overwhelming chiptune as a soundtrack when I got this, as is the norm of indie games with similar visuals; but I must say, even though I'm not a fan of these genres, it really manages to keep the tempo of the game going in quite an energetic manner. I just wish it were longer.+ Smooth flow and progress. The moment you get used to the mechanics, the game will throw a new one at you to keep yourself challenged. Some might find this annoying but I find that it really keeps the game from getting boring and repetitive fast.+ Firm controls. Although, this is a must-have for any twitch game, as it would be extremely frustrating if the controls were sloppy.Cons- Short gameplay prospect. You can finish the whole game in a matter of hours. Although the achievements will keep you going for longer, I definitely wouldn't mind paying for a DLC mappack.- No Linux support as of the time I'm writing this. This is why I wouldn't've bought it in the first place if it weren't for the discount, as it means I can only play this on my Windows laptop.Overall, it's a very good game that is more obscure than it deserves to be and its screenshots don't do it justice to show how much fun it really is. It goes to show that autoscrollers don't necessarily have to be crappy Flash games.If you're a fan of games like VVVVVV, Super Meat Boy, Electronic Super Joy and/or Hotline MIami, get it, you won't regret it. It's worth paying the full price — in fact, get the soundtrack too."

Not as frustrating as it sounds, at least for me. The game is so twitch, it leaves thought behind, and all that's left is reflex and muscle memory. It's got a definite rhythm to it. The collectables tend to reinforce the proper path, but it's not always the only one.Aside from the great art and music, the minimalist writing does its job well. Took me a bit to realize that each world starts with a haiku. There's a sizable cast of characters, each with their own motivations.

The game boasts 120 levels, however each level only lasts about 10-15 seconds.....if you don't die.   Which you will.  Thousands of times.   Among the three worlds are four separate sections and each introduces new obstacles, mechanics, or combinations of the two.  Just getting through all the levels is a task in itself and nearly 7 hours in I'm almost there.  But really, the game makes it quite obvious that simple completion is not enough.  It demands perfection in the form of collecting all the Atomiks in each level and getting a 100% clear rate.  I can't imagine how I'll accomplish this in the World 3 stages, so it looks like this game will be here for the long haul.Take home point: This is the offspring of Canabalt and Super Meat Boy, with all the graphics and music of the former combined with the punishing level design and difficult collectibles of the latter.

I'm sorry, but who thought that combining a precision game with loose as heck flight controls was ever a good idea? I've tried to tolerate this one, I really have. But the introduction of the windmill mechanic (which looks really cool in the trailer, sure) just completely broke me. All atomiks up until that level, and then more deaths on that level than any level prior. Yeah, no. Good riddance, to be honest. This game takes its simple concept and does seemingly everything wrong with it. There's zero satisfaction to be had in completing a level because it feels more like chance than anything. You can't recreate the same plays over and over because of how imprecise the controls are. And the game somehow expects you to be precise regardless? It feels less like gaining any skill and more just memorizing things until you eventually maybe win. And honestly my patience has completely run out.Also, the soundtrack is obnoxious. More precision games need to take cues from Dustforce and have quiet, relaxing soundtracks instead of blaring noisefests that only make frustration worse. Also, having the shooting sound so loud is... very much not a good idea, it's awful. Game looks okay I guess. Story is... ehh. Kind of there, kind of not.

I wanted to love this game.I REALLY wanted to love this game and for the first hour+ I did.Controls are simple, concept is great and MOST levels are designed GREAT.The soundtrack is incredible and for the most part the game IS actually a lot of fun and challenging.So why a negative review?I honestly feel like I got tricked somehow into buying a turd with gold paint on it. This game SHOULD be a new indie gem but it's held back by a few particularly sh**** things that ruin the whole experience.It could have been all FUN but it's plagued by clearly sadist devs with mental issues that are backed by the type of CONSUMERS who don't think a game is fun unless they have similar issues & it's ""hardcore"". Makes me more frustrated with the gaming community knowing that they tend to ENCOURAGE this sort of f***ery to be made in the first place and looking at most of the reviews for this game on here I can clearly see they didn't even play long enough to get through most of the game, either.In a nutshell, this game is a perfect example of devs trying way too hard to make a game that's ""hardcore"" just for the sake of being hardcore as opposed to being fun. It's like Flappy Bird on bad acid.Here's the breakdown:1. LEVEL DESIGN:Before I elaborate, know this game is a ""runner"" in the sense that you're character moves forward automatically with the screen. You have no control over this. Only your gun which shoots whatever is in front of you or shoots downward so you can ""jump"". Not a bad thing until you start playing certain levels.Many are well designed but if you've ever heard the phrase ""one rotten apple spoils the bunch"", however, you will understand why this is listed. It's not just ONE level that's bad. There's at least 16 of the 120 that are just plain dog s***. Here's a list:World 1: Lvl 39World 2: Lvl 19,22,31,32,33,35,36,37 & 38World 3: Lvl 9,10,18,21,22,23I listed these FIRST because their p*** poor designs bring out all the OTHER big flaws of the game.They're unnecessarily tight(which is just grueling for the game mechanics) and you will find yourself dying MANY cheap deaths by either the NPC's, the absurdly high amount of spikes and the most eye rolling of all, the screen itself squishing you into a wall. -_-EVERYTHING in these levels(even on the good ones) are strategically placed to ensure you have the absolute most ""challenging"" experience possible. Problem is that it's done too well and the game is ridden with programmer mentality issues because of it in these levels.They're plagued by poor wall placement, OP NPC choices & placement and an absurd amount of SPIKES that are just overkill.2. LIMITED RANGEYour nameless character holds a fully automatic machine gun that has limited range across the screen. At first this isn't that bad and for most levels it works. But, the more you play and start to recognize how bad of an idea this is, it becomes rather eye rolling.My only question to the devs is ""Why???"". Why did you all think this was a good idea??? You know real bullets don't work like that, right?3. UNBALANCED LIFE/HPEverything that can hurt you in this game will kill you with one touch. EVERYTHING. I could stub my toe on a rock and I'd die but that's not my biggest gripe here. NOTHING ELSE you come up against follows the same rule and EVERYTHING requires 3-4 shots to die. That may not seem like much but keep reading. Remember your firing range is limited, btw.4. HALF RIDICULOUS GAME LOGICOk, I get that this may sound like a stretch at first but there are elements in this game that make me roll my eyes harder than a bowling ball at the local alley.First things first. There are too many instances where you can shoot an obstacle out of your way and it's somehow still able to hit you. WHY??? Why can't you all just let these things be GONE once I kill them? The difficulty would STILL be plenty ""hardcore"" otherwise.Examples:- Circular saw blades that bounce in front of you after being shot that still need to be shot so you don't run into them.- Same saw blades being shot underwater, bouncing underwater and floating UPWARD out of the water with just the right timing to come and ♥♥♥♥ you up. Devs...saw blades don't FLOAT and they definitely wouldn't BOUNCE underwater. I don't care if this is a game. That's nonsensical horse s***.- Same saws bouncing through WALLS that YOU have to otherwise jump over in underwater areas.5. CHEATING A.I.The flying saucer ships and flamethrower poles are way too smart. The ships predict EVERY SINGLE point on the screen you're likely to land and exploit them PREEMPTIVELY. The flamethrower poles are even worse and hone in on your every move. You have to ""trick"" them into thinking you're on another part of the screen to get passed them most times. Their range is also better than your own.6. YOUR ""JUMP""This being a core component to the gameplay, it CANNOT be too flawed for the whole package to work. The physics behind your ""jump"" literally don't seem to know if they want to be too sensitive or too much the opposite. When you stop stop shooting downward you will fall. FAST. Hold the down shoot too long and you SKYROCKET upward. This doesn't work when most of the ground and ceiling is covered with SPIKES. Considering this is supposed to be ""twitch"" style gameplay it's even worse since the ""jump"" has brief startup time.7. THE LAST WORLDI'm putting the ENTIRE last world on this list because of one thing in particular.WATER PHYSICS.This is by far the WORST idea these guys had. It's so bad that it could have still gotten this game a downvote even if everything already listed wasn't an issue. All the way until you get to these levels, you get used to a very simple button layout. One makes you jump. One lets you shoot. But the WATER f**** it all up by REVERSING THE CONTROLS when you're submerged. It becomes a nightmare on some of the most crucial parts of these bad levels because you have to be even more careful in almost no time to think about your moves. Especially when this reversal can literally mean going UP when you want to go down and vice versa. Causes way too many cheap deaths.CONCLUSION:Wrap all this together in those 16 levels, you immediately go from having a great fun little gem to having a hot mess train wreck.The biggest irony of this game is you have to literally P***YFOOT your way through it just to win when it makes itself out to be ""a tough as nails game"".Dad: ""Careful now, son...don't step on that rock over there...or touch that pole...or that flower. You'll die.""Son: ""What CAN I touch, Dad?""Dad: ""Nothing, son. Nothing.""Son: *Blank stare*I despise games that require you to be perfect just to progress. This game is a prime example. There's no room for error on any level. NONE. You're either perfect or you die. Over and over and OVER again. Gets old real quick and when I start yelling at the screen you must have really f***** up. It takes A LOT for me to get to that point these days. F*** the level skip option. Not justification and if anything it and the infinite respawn just prove that the devs are sadistic pr***s.I'm a lot calmer than I was 5+ years ago and can't even recall the last time I rage quit a game or threw a controller.I did the former with this game at least 5 times and that 5th time nearly did the latter.When I started I had an extremely high level of excitement and enthusiasm that went to an unnerving level of frustration within the first sit down and got worse afterward JUST from those 12 levels.I RARELY write reviews like this. I want my f*****g money back. Wouldn't even finish it had I not clocked too many hours to refund or appreciated the parts that ARE good.I might even have carpal tunnel syndrome now cause of this s***."

Simple, right? You are constantly thrusted forward from the left to the right of the screen - think of it as a 2D side-scrolling runner (Jetpack Joyride) and you've got the idea. I want you to imagine the difficulty of Super Meat Boy, the psychedelic flair of Hotline Miami and a few reject characters that didnt make it into a Mad Max film.What's not to like?Even though the game offers you a whopping 120 handcrafted levels, it's important to note how repetetive this game gets and how quickly it gets that way. In my short time playing - half hour, I must've conquered 45 levels.I wasn't impressed with the level design, it seemed too much of the same thing over and over. The problem is that they were the fact they were all super short/small levels that take 15-20 seconds to complete but keep in mind that there is alotta of death too.  The soundtrack is very calming, strange choice considering the gameplay is so frantic but it works.I could fall asleep playing this game, the music is soothing, the gameplay is simple, the levels are repetitive. The only thing that would wake me up would be the rainbow that streaks across the screen when you die. It's like the brightflash of a camera. Annoyingly effective.Don't be fooled!We have people here claiming that this game is a ""Hardcore Platforming Game"".It's NOT.It's a runner with super short levels, nothing more, nothing less.While the game seems like a mixed bag of great ideas and inspirations, it falls flat. It simply lacks soul and that's a shame. Part of the fault is trying too hard to do what Hotline Miami did. Bare in mind, I'm not talking about gorey top down shooting, I'm talking about featuring acid color graphics, strange abstract characters and an out-there story. RunGunJumpGun tries to do this accomplish this with an effort but fails to deliver us that unique feeling.VerdictYeah, I refunded. This game shouldn't have been released on PC, and it's not getting the attention it deserves because it got released on the wrong platform. This game is refined for mobile, it's of mobile quality and it would sell like crazy on Android/iOS, ot would also play better with touch controls and it wouldn't get repetetive on mobile because nobody plays on mobile for hours, only short bursts.It's not worth your money on PC. As pc gamers, we sit for hours at a desk and want a definitive game experience, this is not that game...TL/DR*Gameplay:Fast, frantic but ultimately repetetive. It's a limited runner game... very limited.*The story:Badly written. Don't expect it to keep your interest (skip button will be pressed). Characters spurt random mumble at start of each level.*The characters:Forgettable. Like the rejects that won't ever make it into a Mad Max film, poorly designed with bland personalities.*The soundtrack:Easily the best thing about the game but doesn't go with the game. Calming tunes while the gameplay is chaotic.*Controls:Tight but only 2 buttons? Better suited for touch controls on tablet.*Graphics:""Look at me! I have the same color palette as Hotline Miami, I must be good!""Lame! I was waiting for this game for awhile, it's nearly as disappointing as No Man's Sky and Mighty No. 9."

The visuals are flashy and neon-like (very pretty), and the soundtrack and sound effects go well with it. It can be a little frustrating at times because of its difficulty level, but it still gives you that ""Just one more run, I can do this."" feeling.I would definetly recommend picking this up on a sale if you are looking for a fast paced game that will challenge your inner completist."
,Recommended,440550,30967922,Posted: 5 April,all,Walrus,"A brillant example of tough but not frustrating.Gameplay:.Its one of the hardest games i have played and if you are looking for a game to relax you should turn back now. The game has a decent amount of obstacles such as spikes, saws, death rays, fire balls and beams, space ships that fly and attack you and more. As for controls its simple one button to fly up and shoot below and one button to shoot directly ahead.Soundtrack:The soundtrack on this game matches the gameplay perfectly; Quick and twitchy.Story:As of yet I have not finshed the game so I cant say for certain if the story ramps up at the end but I have a feeling it wont. The story is clearly not a main priority of the game and it is relegated to little pop up charecters you see after beating each level which are cute and give the game some humor and backstory but are not very meaningfull or deep.Overall:I think this game is highly addictive and worth the price tag especially if you are a fan of the genre"

If you die, it was YOUR fault! This game is actually fun to get frustrated at, because nothing is ever unfair. A level may take you 100 attempts, but when you finally succed you'll know it was because mastered the level - not because you got lucky."

,Recommended,440550,33154281,Posted: 2 July,all,sneezebot,"This game is absolutely too good for whay I payed for it. It's a bit hard to lay out in simple terms, in part because the game itself is so mechanically simple. There are only two buttons: Left Shift and Right Shift. LShift causes your little spaceperson to fire their gun down and rocket upwards, and RShift causes them to shoot forward and go down. By default, you are bound to the ground, so to avoid obstacles like homing saws and incessantly firing mortars you have to carefully maneuver using only those two contradicting commands, and the result is a bloody difficult runner game. The presentation is really rather stunning too, with incredibly trippy graphics and a bumpin soundtrack. Oh and if you own Downwell you get 25% off, so for literally a dollar twenty-five, this is a must have."

Some of the characters are quite profound. 10/10
