,Not Recommended,440630,24147018,"Posted: 6 July, 2016",all,"Communist ""Joseph Ballin"" Layton","It took a pretty long time for this game to go from demo to full experience, and I'm not really sure what took them so long. Considering how many of the monsters are store-bought assets I have suspicions on how much of the rest of the game's visuals were the same way, and what little story the game has is delivered by a single voice actor who could've probably knocked the whole thing out in an afternoon.While the game does look great (it's probably one of the best looking VR games I've seen so far), the gameplay is just dull; there are a lot of wave shooters coming out on the Vive, and not all of them are good, but the ones that are memorable at least have some mechanic to set it out from the rest. Space Pirate Trainer has its slow-mo and visuals, Holopoint has the bow mechanics, etc. Almost all of them encourage you to duck and weave around the arena, avoiding projectiles and getting into a rhythm of dodging and returning fire. The Brookhaven Experiment does the bare minimum to encourage to to take even a single step, and the most efficient way to play the game is to just stand in place firing at things. The only enemy that breaks the trend is the spider mutant that shoots web that covers either your face or controller, requiring you to shake it off to keep going, but the spiders are more annoying than fun because the game constantly sets their spawn points to areas that are pitch black, and in the level they're introduced in they come out of a dark hole right above you and even with the flashlight on them they're nearly impossible to see sometimes.The game's main feature is its attempt to do survival oriented gameplay, with the player's ammo and flashlight batteries limited. But it never really works because throughout the pretty short campaign your bullets cross over between levels, so by the end you'll almost inevitably have racked up thousands of bullets for one gun or another. There's also a survival mode, but for some confusing reason only 3 of the game's 12-or-so campaign levels are actually playable in it. What really kills the campaign is that its distribution of upgrades throughout the levels is a bit poorly balanced, and in just the second level you can get a laser sight that basically turns the game into a point-and-click adventure featuring mutants. There are other upgrades, like throwable weapons and different ammo types, but you'll almost definitely never use them because you have to use a trackpad menu to get to them, and there's no way to pause the game while navigating it.But what really bothers me about how long it's taken is how obvious some of the bugs are. Even with the game being delayed an extra week to avoid the sale, the game has problems like the gun and flashlight hands consistently registering wrong when you start the game, and at the moment I have no idea what the final level even looks like because choosing the second-to-last level in the chapter select screen just chooses an earlier level instead.There is a decent game here, but I don't think it's worth $20 at all in its current state. It has some new stages and enemies but it doesn't add enough to justify going from the free demo to $20, and I think most people are just going to be content with what the demo offers. If you preordered for $15 for the long period of time that was available then good on you, but I still think you paid a little too much. The only reason I didn't refund this game halfway through the campaign was because I have friends and relatives who will scream at anything with a zombie in it.Update: The bugs with the gun being in the wrong hand and the chapter select being broken have been fixed, at least."

It's not totally triple-A polished, where it seems like it is trying to be, but it still has enough graphical fidelity and quality of assets. The length is also quite sufficient, there were several stages to beat in the campaign, and then you can play wave/survival after!.The actual game-play wasn't much to sneeze at; it's a wave shooter, but a very good one.It would have been nice to have the realistic VR reloading instead of just hitting a button.I don't remember the game being that hard, and it was mostly about ammo conservation. If you didn't run out of ammo, you were fine -- this excludes the wild card of those damn spiders. Ithinkyou can shake your gun to remove their evil webbing!It was an early title, with alot of hype, and the EVERYONE played the demo level when they got the Vive.This review is coming in very late, and I appear to be speaking in the past tense, which is interesting. Yes, it should be 14.99 now that zombie wave shooters are a vast milieu, so you can wait for a sale. Sure enough, the demo was one of the first things I played when I got my HTC Vive Virtual Reality Home Entertainment System!When playing the demo, I didn't realize it, but a friend noticed me looking at the controller each time I hit the reload button, and they thought it was funny. I was so immersed!http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=896713072"
,Not Recommended,440630,24172044,"Posted: 7 July, 2016",all,sedition,"UPDATED 8/27/16In some ways a nice improvement from the demo. Unfortunately in the parts that really matter (gameplay) it is much worse.Gun recoil - this is new from the demo and while i agree that the demo was a bit easy with no recoil, as an avid shooter in real life, it is terribly over exaggerated in this game and extremely slow to reset. It is painfully obvious the developers have never actually fired a pistol in real life and the game suffers as you have to do crazy compensation or take an excessive amount of time to kill some of the larger zombies, which will ultimately doom you in later levels.red 'damage' vision - Take more than 30% damage and you basically won't be able to see. The entire screen goes red and coupled with the near pitch black enviorment makes it almost impossible to see, even with the flashlight.* UPDATE:  The devs have reduced this effect to be less crippling. Overall a much appreciated fix.performance - game constantly runs in projection on an overclocked gtx 970. this is the only game out of over 30 that do this for me. results in 'double vision', easily noticeable when moving the gun. A performance / super sampling slider (the game appears to have built in it's own super sampling that you cannot change) would be extremely helpful in increasing performance.weapon switching - clumsy and slow. you are forced to use a trackpad menu that is animated and slow to use, rather than just binding it to a trackpad direction which would have made much more sense.* UPDATE: The devs have made switching weapons easier by simply pressing a direction on the thumb pad.level design - the difficulty lies in the added darkness in each level (a bit too dark, especially compared to the demo) and enemies that can and will hit you before they can be seen, even with a flashlight pointed directly at them (storm drain level is a good example of this).* UPDATE: Level lighting has been improved a little and the flashlight is noticably brighter now and throws light a bit farther. No longer feels like you are using a $5 keychain flashlight.graphics - graphics are fairly good here, one of the better looking VR games out there. Unfortunately without a 980ti or higher though you are likely to spend quite a bit of time in reprojection.I was really looking forward to this game and even pre-ordered it before release, which i rarely do. It is a shame that it turned out this way and at this time I would absolutely stay away from brookhaven experiment.* UPDATE: Unfortunately with continued performance issues and over exaggerated gun recoil I still cannot recommend this game. There are plenty of wave shooters out there right now that deserve your money first. Hordez, Raw Data, and even Zombie Training Simulator are all great games I would recommend checking out first."

There was definite excitement leading up to its launch. Like most things that get hyped, its tough to live up to expectation. Im happy to say that while maybe it didnt quite get there, it got close (for me) and it is indeed a great title, with a few bum notes.I dont want to spoil anything, so Im going to be understandably vague for a moment.There were a few key things that the game had to add IMO on top of the demo, content-wise, in order for it to be a great game. Of course, you know you have your new weapons to unlock, some trinkets which can buff certain stats can be found, and some surprise elements. They are all there and accounted for!There are no difficulty options that I could see.(*They have since been patched in)The campaign mode (which is all Ive done as of writing this review - there is a Survival mode too) is paced a little too slow for my liking. Mobs come predictable and steady for most early stages, your average player isnt going to have much issue. Youre also told to use the flash light sparingly, but I rarely turned it off (altho insta atmosphere +2 when you do!) and had plenty of battery (ammo is similarly ample). The pace does pick up in later levels and some awesome moments await. The sound is great. The scenes are detailed and atmospheric. The models for the enemies are great.Some bad stuff:For someinsanereason, you are required to select a full load-out between each wave. Not per game, not per scene/stage, but *every single freaking wave!* An option to continue with the same items would be GREATLY appreciated.(*This has since been patched in, ALTHO as of amending this review, I found it to sometimes leave out some of your loadout)On top of that, there is some odd delays between info screens, its a 2 second pause (multiple) that just doesnt need to be there (In case you think maybe its my system, thats unlikely, new Broadwell-e OC'd with all the trimmings).While the scenes are well detailed, with good design, you are sitting in the same place for each level. Non interactive too.Some small bugs (*snip* review too long - nothing game breaking!!)I dont like the low health status effect, even without being that low health (half-ish) the entire screen gets a red fog which gets denser the lower your health. Id rather a vignette effect.(*This has since been patched in, I like the new visual)Also, no heartbeat sound effect! That one is in the rule book, surely!The biggest let down, by a mile, is your contact. She sounds like an older lady, who had a sherry-ambien mixer, and frankly couldnt care less about you or even conveys any personality for the most part. She'll tell you about the vital tasks you must do (altho, you dont really do anything, you stand and shoot things!), but her tone and sense of urgency could also fit perfectly with reminding you to DVR her stories (soaps/drama). Actually, she'd give more of a crap about those things!Im not going to end on a bad note, so Im pretty much going to repeat the TL;DR. The good very much outweighs the bad, and this game has enough content to be worth your time and purchase. Its a quality shooter. I will revisit this review in the future, as the game is newly launched and will inevitably have tweaks and patches over the coming months. But it is an easy recommendation as is.**UPDATE 15th Sep**Been off from VR land over a month, but as I said I would update this review down the line, Ive gone and had a play around with the newer version of this game, which has since received some patching.The updated good:The lack of difficulty options (and options in general) has been addressed.The very poor low (where ""low"" could stand for 70%!) health effect has been improved.(Old lady still dgaf tho, not that I expected them to re-record/cast her dialog/role.)The updated bad:While the option to reuse your previously selected loadout is a new and welcome addition, it can forget some of your choices, namely special ammo and throwables.Even in the 40 mins I played of the updated version, new bugs have crept in, such as cropping of the scoreboard. I can see ""SCO"" (score) at the top and the first 2 and a half numbers of my points. Or that the SP cost of some items randomly are not shown (health and batteries) - you still get charged tho!Not sure to include this as a bad/bug, as there are other factors that could be at play. But I was having a hard time getting headshots. Even using the laser sight with the line connecting between their eyes was not working. Adjusting my aim and tilt (physically) slightly to hit at the very top of their skull worked. They have added an angle option, but I didnt alter it. So IDK. Im no eagle eye and I havent used my Vive in a month, maybe a recalibration is in order :S"

It is also fun to taunt and watch other people play and see their reactions. Word of advice though, if you are demoing this with a person who is easily scared, try to protect them against the wall because they will just run backwards, this game is seriously immersive and the enemies will be in your face.In terms of gameplay, well it's a wave shooter, but they have polished the wave shooting mechanic plus  they upped the scare factor to 11 (you get desensitized after 1 hour though) but then just when you know you are so good at this game, it throws you a new enemy and mechanic to beat them making it fresh and hectic again. The game slowly unlocks weapons and upgrades as well as slowly introduce enemies so the difficulty curve in this game is just right.Sound design is stunning, spatial sound is crucial to know where a specific type of enemy is coming and you want to prioritize since this game is played in 360 degrees.There's also a survival mode which tests your skill on how you conserve bullets and manage your resources (no leaderboards though but no biggy)"

It is running very stable, no FPS problems and it is scary as hell. If you play this game you better get a towel, because you will sweat. And that sweat isn't just from moving but mostly from being so scared! The campaign is really cool, introducing new enemies over time and increasing the difficulty."
,Recommended,440630,24833721,"Posted: 11 August, 2016",all,DiBiddilyBop,"This game knows what it wants to be and executes it really well.  If you're old like me, then you'll probably remember those shooting games at the arcade where you grabbed the gun and shot the zombies/outlaws/deer/whatever on the screen in front of you.  Brookhaven is basically the next generation of that kind of game.  You stand mostly in place (although the game does give you some reasons to move) and wheel around in 360 degrees shooting all kinds of badness that wants to eat your face.  In both survival and a bit in campaign, it's important to manage your ammunition and when you can afford to, it's good to save you flashlight battery, save your ammo, and knife the zombies instead of shooting them.The storyline is really nothing to write home about and mostly just an excuse for the game, which in all honest is fine.  I'm not too concerned about what exactly the Brookhaven experiment was or why it created all the zombies, I just want to shoot them.It's also great fun to give this one to your girlfriend/wife/mother-in-law-who-you-want-to-give-a-heart-attack-to and watch their reactions.

76561198020445786,Recommended,440630,32352298,Posted: 11 June,all,M1ng0J1ng0,"7.8 out of 10After the intial hype and nearly one year later how does this game stack up. Quite well, the visuals remain good looking today and it's creepy atmosphere still keeps the heart rate up and the nerves on edge. The gameplay style itself is a slow paced horror wave shooter spread across a series of locations that unlock as you clear these stage. Each stage is multi-waved each progressivly more challenging.Between waves you can pick up more ammo, change/buy weapons (and customise), batteries for the torch, and health. The tension lies in the limited options you have, you can't pick more ammo, health and batteries, only one pickup per wave. The Brookhaven Experiment isn't a terribly difficult shooter on the surface, most zombies are slow and only a small number are lurching in your direction at once. Where the challenge lies is the limited resources on hand, ammo isn't infinite so headhots are crucial and each bullet counts giving that starved for ammo Resident Evil feel.Outside the main strorymode there's the addition of survival horde levels.This is a horror game for horror fans. If your taste is high octane shooting action you'll be hugely disapointed, this is walking dead slow action."

,Recommended,440630,34047859,Posted: 5 August,all,SilentCaay,"One of the better VR wave shooters I've played so far. It's fun, intense and there's at least a couple hours of content. It's not all great, though...By the way it's been described, I expected more horror elements but aside from the jumpscare in the first mission, there's nothing too scary (unless you consider a game like House of the Dead scary). There's darkness but it's more annoying than scary since it forces you to use the flashlight mod for your guns because not using a flashlight isn't an option and your literal flashlight has batteries that waste away faster than a snowman in the desert. The jumpscare is also disappointing in retrospect because it alters the stage between waves but that's the only time such a change happens. For the rest of the game, the stages are the same for all waves.One of the bigger negative points is the large random variance in later stages. You can cruise through waves 1, 2 and 3 in one run and get absolutely slaughtered in wave 1 in another run due to monster spawns. If you randomly get too many of the small runners or the spiders, you're done (seriously, spiders are the goddamn worst). This is a big issue for two reasons - First, you can't progress unless you clear all the waves in one go and dying sends you back to wave 1. Second, you aren't given enough ammo for the better weapons to use them every wave so it's supposed to be a matter of conserving them for tougher waves but there's no way to tell which waves are tougher since it's so random.Overall, it's far from perfect but it's one you'll want in your VR library right now since there aren't too many complete games available and this one is pretty much complete. It's also something you'll want to show people when demoing VR."

The demo was one of my favorite Vive games to show off to others.  Watching them play it was fun and it was easy for them to pick up.  Now, with the full version, friends spend more time asking questions, trying to figure out the buying system and which items they should choose.  It's a bit too convoluted for me and I find that this buying system takes away from the action and horror of it all.  *sigh*  Such is the case with most games today, I suppose.  Does everything need a grind mechanic to simulate progress now?  There's something to be said for simplicity, especially in VR gaming, since one probably shouldn't spend hours at a time in an HMD.  Still, it remains one of the best VR games, but would be even better with a mode that removes the immersion-breaking buying system.

Challenging and Frustration share a thin boundary-- but fun should be the focus2) Why is survival mode only for 3 or 4 of the many levels? There are other maps I wish I could play survival mode on.And lastly...2) (SPOILER ALERT)The end animation for the boss should be more ""majestic""-- it was a bit of a letdown for me.

I didn't pre order as my way of saying, you guys did a great job so heres full price. The Full version in my opinion does improve upon the Demo with the addition of a sudo campaign, more guns, more extras and more monsters. However, there are a few things that bug me. First and foremost, the weapon switching feature using the thumbstick is painfully clumsy and slow. It's so slow that it's not worth swapping your gun for a flash bang or any other multi round throwable. By the time you switch back to your gun it's most times, too late. It would be far better to have a right and left swipe to cycle through weapons. Also, a menu system should utilize the topmost vive button as most other games do.   The Multi Burst\Uzi it powerful but useless in later waves as you just don't have enough bullets. If you choose this weapon you'll surely be using it to bludgen your enemies far more than shooting them. Worth 20.00? yes, but it will need work if it's going to stand the test of time."

This is a zombie shooter but it's incredibly immersive. Zombies of varying sizes and shapes attack from all sides. This game will keep you on your toes. And the graphics are fairly polished. Not stunning like Skyrim, but still at a decent quality.What I really like about the game is that it feels very real. You need to manage your ammo count. You don't get infinite bullets so you need to strategize how to get through each wave of zombies most efficiently. You may chose a powerful gun only to find that you don't have enough ammo to kill all the zombies in a particular wave. One gun, a machete and zombies coming at you from all sides! You'll need to put some thought into it, not just blast away. This is one of the rings I really like about this game.Beyond just shooting there's a bit of narration going on telling you what's happening and why you're there. The voice acting is top notch.On the downside I was never able to figure out the mechanics of grenades.

I'm on the sewar level.If you liked the demo this is more of the same, but... toned down a bit.Note: some of the bad is being taken on by future patches as announced by the Devs, so keep that in mind and keep in mind it does have a ""Yes"" Recommendation from me.The Bad:No difficulty setting, the first few levels are like a ""My first time in VR experience"" so no matter how inept you are your survival odds are good.No live ammo pick up, so they break everything into rounds. Between each round you have to re-select your load out, all of it. There is also a noticable wait after each round before the menu pops up. Combining all of these sort of kills the momentum of the game and takes an awesome situation you are getting into and turns it into a borring experience.When you get a ""item"" it blocks our part of your screen with a really bright notification that you can't look around and this both takes you out of the experience and blinds you while you are trying to see in their dark levels.No Co-opVoice acting... This was so bad it needed it's own line... please start over and issue an update. Could probably get someone from the comunity to do it for free even and you can just overlay it into the system replacing the track that's there now. Seriously, Zero emotion from the voice acting and it sounds like the person doing it is more interested in getting out of the studio to go watch ""Murder She Wrote"" than anything else. A show so old that google is needed for anyone in this generation to know what it is.The Good:It's polishedThe gun play feels good and aiming does require a bit of skill.Ammo counter on the gun is a nice touch and is placed in a way that it is not distracting but easy to access quickly.Good variety of mobs to deal with.Atomos-fear is great ;)Artwork on the levels is ""Decent"" lot's of sharp edged plain jane walls, just a retextured box basically.. but there are a lot of really nicely drawn items as well and the mobs look great!Hit box reactions are goodPositional audio is fantastic! You can tell exactly where the mobs are coming fom just through sound and it's fantastic and really helps add to the experience.Over all, it's one of the most pollished experiences out there, but the lack of momentum and constant interuptions of the game world combined with the terrible voice acting and stationary placement gives this game a lower score in my book.Edit: upped score just a bit because of Dev team working so hard even after release to improve the game and listening to their fan base.

I bought this game, played it for 45 minutes, and immediately am refunding it.This game has a single massive pro: The spook is very real.  The zombie creatures give off the same vibe as those in 28 Days Later and it is legitimately terrifying and panic-inducing, which is awesome.Sadly, that's just about the only positive thing I could say about it.  The game generally feels like little more than a tech demo that was intended to show off how great VR is, than an actual 20$ release.  Besides the background spook factor, after a while, the game feels like you're just waiting for zombies to walk into your gun.  Here are my specific annoyances:-Sound design feels weak and low-budget.  In a game like this, that can really take you out of the immersion.-Unbalanced weaponry.  All the pistols are pretty much equally generic and average, the SMG guns are generally overpowered but run out of ammo way too quickly for it to feel like a viable option ever.  The shotgun is dumb as heck, just because in a 360 degree VR FPS, close-quarter combat weapons are plain stupid since you have to patiently wait for the zombies to walk close up enough to you.  And the revolver- oh boy.  So overpowered that it not only renders all the other guns useless, but is so OP it makes the game boring.-The weapon attachments, charms, and special ammo types all feel ridiculously tacked-on and phony.  I can tell that the developers probably only added this because they were insecure about the lack of content they had.-Physics: Literally every enemy, when approaching me to attack within a foot or two, they *literally* did a harmless leap-frog over me before attacking me.  I get that this is just a glitch, but in a game like this, it's immersion-breaking enough to be game-breaking.  I'm panicking as they're approaching me, only for them to do this weird and totally-not-terrifying attack.-AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL hitpoint display//gore tendencies.  This is really the game-breaking issue.  The enemies are animated so that when you shoot them on a zone of their body- pretty much only either arm or head- that body part awkwardly disappears.  Where's the gore!?!?!? I would've expected/wanted in this kinda game a killing floor-esque gore system where the enemies feel brutally dismemberable. This game feels ultra low-budget and because of this, killing the zombies does not feel even close to satisfying.  In a game like this, especially with such a lack of content, it's absolutely UNACCEPTABLE to have bland and unsatisfying gore.Maybe 6 months ago when commercially available virtual reality was new, this would've (and rightfully should've) made a splash.  New Vive titles, however, are teaching us a MUCH higher standard for shooting quality than this game has.  For over 5$ or so, this game is a definite pass."

The company Brookhaven opens a portal to an alien world and the aliens came through destroying the world. You are a person that is assisting to close the portal. There are two modes, campaing and survival.Campaign: is desgined as a 4 round map where You are challened with seven different alien breeds (techanically there are six breeds) on 8 maps ( might be 7 or 9 maps). You have to be aware of your surroundings for the aliens will come any directions.Survival: you get three maps to play on. Your goal survive as many rounds as you can. The gear can be perminatlly unlocked (not the guns) by how well you do per round. From headshots to how much damage taken. As you get higher, the aliens get tougher.Gear: Throught the campaign you will unlock new gear by finding them on certain maps. New guns, attachments and throwables. The guns seems to be unlocked at resonable times. Weak guns unlock at beginning and stronger ones twords the end. Hoever the guns reload wasn't very accuate seeing how you can still have a round in the champer and the gun does a full reload instead of inserting the clip. The aiming was good, hit the mark I was aiming for everytime which is the head. However headsots were not one hit kills everytime. The attachments are nice but you will find yourself using the laser sight, extended clip, explosive ammo. The main gun you will use is the clock pistol (don't remember the game name).Alien Breeds: There are different typed of aliens.The minions, which are small little gremlin typeWalkers, which look like zombiesRunners- are aliens that walk until you shoot them and then they start runningTanks- are guge aliens that can take alot of hits before dieing, they look like nemesis from resident evilSpinders- they shoot a web that can jam your gun until you shake off the web, cover your flashlight, stoping it from shining or cover your eyes, blinding you.Worms- A worm like alien that can open its mouth from each side of its mouthFinal Alien- The final alien is the one you face off in the last map.The Graphics: the graphics are awesome for virtual reality. The gear looks amazing from the lazer to the muzzle break.The Sound: the sound is epic, every gun sounds different. Every explosive sound is different. The hit indicator sound is nice, allowing the play hear if they hit the target or not.Movment- the movment is what you expect with the HTC Vive. Stand in a spot and look around. The aliens coming from different directions makes the players always moving in a 360 movment.The Good: the game has a lasting appear and is has a replay ability. Allowing players to come back and shoot alien (zombie) butt. With updates still being applied, there is something new to see.The Bad: the game does have its faults, such as aliens getting stuck on cornors or teleporting to a different side of the players (sliding). Headshots not counting as an instant kill.The Score: with everything taken in account, The Brookhaven Experiment gets an easy 7/10 score (or A rank). This game can possibily be game of the year for virtual reality. There is also potental for a Brookhaven Ecperiment 2 game.With that this is a pony game review by gamerhoofster Pony"

The Brookhaven Experiment is stressful, but not a vigorous workout like some VR action games. It will test your ability to shoot straight under pressure - you need to headshot the zombie in front of you even though you know there are two more creeping up behind you. Bullets and battery power are precious, so make em count!I found the game to be challenging and it's not a foregone conclusion that everyone will be able to make it to the end of the campaign. I had to replay the more difficult levels several times each before figuring out how to get the job done.Survival mode is great forfreaking outshowing the game toyour friends, although the levels available at the moment are limited.PRO TIP: Don't waste bullets on the ""babies"" - just kneel and swing!PRO TIP #2: Replaying easy levels can get you more batteries and ammo for tough levels.TIPS FOR DEVS: please - provide a more precise way to compare weapons than misleading bar graphs (PRO TIP #3: the revolver is a beast), and add more levels to survival mode.

Not that I'm saying the game is too easy with them, I just feel that the machete and flashlight both feel pretty similar in strength which seems a bit off.Aside from those small complaints the game is great, it looks great, it feels great with the haptic feedback of the guns, and it sounds great.

Make no mistake, this game will scare a lot of people.  Check out the reaction videos online to see what I mean.  That said, after playing the game for a while, it's more of an action game than horror.It's the kind of game that looks completely different in VR, so you really have to experience it to know what it's like.  It's not the longest game in the world, but it is pretty unique.  The graphics are good, and it's well made.**Be careful not to step on the cord for the headset.  You'll be turning around a lot, and if you do step on the cord and pull it out of its box, you won't be able to see, and (as of the time of writing this) the game does not pause when the headset is disconnected.  If you're on the last wave of a level, and lose because you pulled out the cord, and have to start over, it's pretty frustrating.  Hopefully they'll fix that later."

Although the first five stages were pretty easy they get steadily harder towards the end and presented a fair challenge, for me at least. It has a decent selection of handguns and upgrades which are unlocked by shooting special creates on most of the the levels. The guns all sound and feel different, and also have pros and cons, which add a nice bit of variety to the gameplay. As for the visuals, they can look quite good on some levels but the monster animation is a bit dull for some of the models. What the developers have created is definitely very atmospheric in places but I would have enjoyed a few more surprises. On the plus side, each wave is fairly random so it's not going to be exactly the every time you play it.Aside from the slow pace of the first few levels one other thing I didn't enjoy was a persistant bug where on at least five different occasions the level wouldn't end once I'd shot everything. I'm pretty sure this happens because one of the monsters gets stuck on something when it is out of your view and you therefore cannot shoot it. I also found that the image isn't really sharp enough for aiming down the sights on a handgun. I adjusted the super-sampling but my GTX 1070 based system couldn't seem to reach the visual crispness you can enjoy in other wave shooter titles.I waited until the sale to get this game for less than £10 and am glad that I did. It is very atmospheric and the gunplay is above average so I felt that the £8.99 I paid for it was a fair price. I'm not sure how much replay value I'll get out of it but it is definitely a fun game for first time VR users to try so it will get more use when I show the system to friends.Having said all that, the positives definitely outweigh the negatives and if the price is acceptable to you then I'd say it's worth a purchase."

Reprojection is necessary unless I further boost the decent GPU OC to very unstable levels (1500mhz~), which is a no go. I am unsure if the game scales with the GPU you have, so if you have a 970 or lower end 980 I would shy away from this title.All in all still cool enough for $20, even if it is not a match for other gallery shooters I am sure it will sate people until a proper zombie VR game is out (Arizona Sunshine / Zombie Riot perhaps?) and I look forward to reading that it has been stabilized so I can finish playing it."

The ambiance and environment variety are excellent. The game is damn scary, the good kind of scary (lugubre places, monsters are ugly, working under pressure) and is not relying on jump scare (unless you don't watch your back).  I am enjoy myself very much, but I feel like the first levels were too short. It seems to stretch in length the more you progress, but I really liked the first environment and only got to play in it for a couple minutes. My concerns for now are:-It seems a bit easy to me (maybe I'll regret saying that further in the game).-The throwables and knife are not very easy/quick to equip and feels a bit useless since youopt for shooting instead of using them, plus seems a bit bugged (sometime the grenade icon doesn't appear and I exited accidentaly once trying to equip one).- No achievements- With my i7-4790K and GTX 970 I got a few short moment where it goes back to the steam VR main screen and back to the game, most of it happened outside a wave, but once it happened using the flare gun. No lag though.Seems to be well worth the price tag. Buy it without hesitation, it is one of the most polished/full fledged game for the Vive. I will edit my review if any changes occurs further down the line,"

Whereas everything else has felt like a demo.Pros:+Enemies and enviroments look great.+Having to manage the energy in your flashlight vs being able to see enemies coming from afar makes the game feel very tense and exciting.+The later levels are very difficult and require a lot of energy from you in order to survive. Be ready for a really intense workout to prevent being overhwelmed. You'll find yourself switching between slashing smaller enemies biting at your ankles to sniping spiders shooting projectiles from the ceiling.+Plenty of different guns and addons to unlock, giving you a lot of choices for how to play.+Very diverse enemies with varied attacks meaning you have have to prioritise what to kill and when.+Lots different stages. Each of which has hidden unlockables, and different paths for enemies to come from. They aren't identical either so you need to learn fast where to expect enemies to stay alive.Cons:-Not a big fan of the ammo system. Would be better to let you choose what to refresh. If you're out of ammo for a gun you want to use you basically have to choose a different one or go back to a previous stage to farm. I feel like this system could have been better executed to make it less tedious.All in all it's a very exciting, active, and fun game. I highly recommend it.

Finding myself constantly trying to conserve ammo and flashlight batteries while keeping myself alive has been a great experience.

A few minutes later, it suddenly put me back up where I should be)Costs money (but whatever, I spent $800 on a vive, I can spend $20 on a fun game)Other Points:Some people say the campaign is a little lacking, as the dialogue is a little sparse and often just serves as flavor and/or a warning about new enemies. I don’t care. It will tell you why there are monsters everywhere. That’s all I really wanted to know, as I was kind of preoccupied spinning around, stepping over my VIVE cord, and trying not to have my face chewed off.There is no real “save game” button yet, so be warned. The auto save seems to keep your number of rounds after a level ends (if you get to the finish of that level, otherwise your unlocks you found are not saved), but at least for me, going back to play the first level again reset all of that, so when I jumped back to a later level, I found myself with 80 rounds of pistol ammo, which was not nearly enough for the hoard ahead. I’m sure this will be fixed at some point, though. All this just makes the game harder.This game is making me hate giant zombie spiders.Overall:If you would enjoy shooting zombies of all flavors, get this game. If you enjoy a relatively difficult shooting game, get this game. If you do not like things running out of the dark to eat you and/or giant zombie spiders, do not get this game."

Sometimes it can get repetitive throughout waves, although each level does feel different which is what keeps me playing. Sometimes a level will have zombies coming from stairs, through tunnels, through a broken wall, or sometimes just from any angle around me. It's pretty spooky too. In the first level a zombie breaks down a barrier on the wall and I actually screamed and my hands started to shake the rest of the wave because of how scared I was.My only really big complaint is the lack of video settings. The game runs okay for me, but in certain areas I will experience jittering and I wish I could adjust the settings to prevent this. Game is beautiful though, maybe thebest looking game with a realistic art style I've played on the Vive. Story is stupid but I didn't buy the game expecting a good story, I played the demo and kept up on the news for this game so all I really expected was to just have a wave based survival zombie game with a progression system and that's exactly what I got."

It's one of the few VR titles that actually feels like a fully-developed product.  With a bit more content, this game could actually pass for a Triple-A title!The Good-----------The feels very solid with very few graphics glitches (which could also be from my GTX 970 video card).  The graphics and sound are excellent, and the voice in your ear-piece sounds very professional and well-acted.  The game is genuinely engaging... far more than any other horror-shooter or zombie apocalypse game I've played on any other platform.  VR is definitely a platform that lends itself to this type of game, and the immersion factor can quickly get your pulse racing.  If you want to show off VR to your family or friends, THIS should be at or near the top of your list of titles to show them!The Bad---------There are no major negatives for this game.  Most of the negatives I will mention are pretty minor things, for example, after every round you have to reselect your weapon and attachments.  If you forget to select your attachments, then your weapon will be not have any of them.  It would be nice if it would simply default to what you had in the previous round.  The kukri blade that you have is a slashing weapon only.  It does nothing if you merely try and stab with it, in spite of the fact that it clearly has a point that is not unlike a spear tip.  It would be nice to allow for a great variety of melee combat moves (such as stabbing and even throwing of the kukri blade).Wishlist--------I can't emphesize enough how good this game is, and I would really love to see more content and additional features added.  In addition to what I mentioned above regarding melee combat, it would also be cool to have a great selection of melee weapons.  It would be really cool if you could move around and fight a bit more, ducking out of the way of one monster as you move in to eviscerate another monster, for example.  With VR a person is real only limited by what they physically can and cannot do--so dropping to the ground and chopping off a leg, then springing up to drive a blade through the monster's skull should be a perfect valid (and damn cool) tactic."

The gun variety keeps the game fun, and the unique customization menu is pretty cool too! Everyone round you can try a new strategy and plan how you're going to conserve your flashlight (I'll admit the flashlight is the only 'survival shooter' aspect and its the only thing you need to conserve as ammo is WAY plentiful).To break it down, since everything I've said is completely subjective xD...Pros:-Awesome gun variety-Fun to unlock things-Terrifying-Fun to play with friends and works great as a party game-PROBABLY THE MOST FLESHSED OUT VIVE GAME ATM!This game doesn't have more than 5 hours of content for one person, lets be real, but the game is reallyreally fun and for the hours you can enjoy it, it feels 'complete' if that makes any sense.You don't feel like something is missing, it seems polished and like a 'real' game. Not just another vive half-finished minigame.Cons:-The recoil is a bit much and needs to be tuned down a bit... Maybe it should be very minor, but increase if the player fires rapidly?-The laser attachment takes all the aiming out of the game, and it needs to be modified.It either needs to be harder to unlock (maybe unlocked through some really hidden box at the endish area of the game)or it needs to be less reliable somehow... It can't ALWAYS be on.-It can be buggy. But really... What VR game is all that polished atm anyway? It comes with the territory of being an early adopter and I haven't really noticed a lot of bugs so far. I'm assuming most of the bugs discussed were elliminated in the past few hotfixes.TL;DRIt's a great game, and you should totally buy it if you're on the fence!"

Whilst it might not have the interesting reload mechanics of something like Hover Junkers, the shooting in this game is still immensely satisfying. The look and sound of the weapons feels spot on, I just wish my aim was! The lurching horrors come at you from every which way, leading to a viscerally thrilling experience where you really need to be looking around to shoot them in time, often with precious few seconds to line up your shot. Things can get super intense real fast when these buggers get up in your face and you have to whack them away with a knife.Aside from the gameplay, I also really like Brookhaven's art style. The decaying world it's set in is wonderfully atmospheric with shades of Lovecraft in the background. There's great attention to detail with some truly top notch effects work. The only negative is a fairly clunky in-game menu, which can make it hard to select your weapon or even quit at times. Having said that, I absolutely love what I've played so far (keep getting whacked to death on the early levels) and I really hope this ""experiment"" has a bright future ahead, because I'd love to see more!"

The campaign is actually pretty lengthy, although there’s isn’t much depth in the story. There’s some solid challenge in the later levels as well as in the Survival mode that just keeps going and going until you bite the dust.Overall, I have really enjoyed my time with TBE and it’s one of my go to games to let my shooter friends play when they come over to try out VR, especially if they hate spiders, because there are some in the game.

While the game is certainly far from perfect, the core mechanics are rock solid and I can honestly say that I just enjoyed playing it from start to finish.  The environments are highly immersive, and the first several playthoughs genuinely scared my pants off.  The difficulty then escalates at a nice, steady pace, and the final boss fight is extremely satisfying to finish.To briefly summarize the game, you basically stand in a little rectangular area and fend off waves of monsters that want to kill you.  It is almost comical how utterly incompetent your character is at choosing defensible positions, given that every level has you fighting off bad guys from every direction.  I guess no one told this guy how to use choke points or covered flanks?  Fortunatley, that's fogivable because the game would obviously not be nearly as fun or challenging if you only had to defend long hallways with one access point.After fending off each wave, you are given the choice of either scavenging for ammo or healing up your wounds.  This places a nice stress on the player as it forces you to choose between reloading your favorite weapon or not dying at the first strike from a zombie.The difficulty is certainly up there during later levels, but I never felt they were ""too"" difficult.  After a little practice and some careful planning, I was eventually able to fight my way through to the next level of the game.  It's a nice balance where you feel like you've accomplished something with every advancement because the game forces you to work a little to get there.Overall, if you like scary games with lots of guns and action, this a great game for VR.

The tension is really good2.	It’s a zombie gameCons:1. When the screen goes red after you have been hit it's hard to see.2. The knife is a bit useless, in my opinion it should be way longer, otherwise there keep clawing away, the next minute the screen is too red to see. (That’s if you’re out of bullets of course)3. It takes too long for the guns to load.4. There should be a setting for the graphics (I cannot see where) as with my top spec computer the zombies still look rather dull!5. There should be more interaction than just the zombies coming to us. To be honest it gets boring fairly quickly! Maybe to move around a bit more would be good, so in the dark when the zombie appears all of a sudden you can choose to either shoot, knife it, or walk the hell away!6. I understand that the scene outside is supposed to be dark, although with my torch coupled with the fairly poor animation I cannot see all the zombies until they are clawing away.I understand that is supposed to be the tension of the game BUT cannot the torch be brighter or the overall brightness outside be taken up a notch or two!7. When text appears on the screen, for example when you have achieved something, it is hard to read as the text appears to the far left! (small gripe)"

For instance the throwables should be on the flashlight hand since that hand is pretty much useless most of the time and you would think since the ammo and supplies go with you from level to level the flashlight batteries would as well. It's really annoying to save your batteries just to have no light in the next level when visibility is even worse then the one they gave full batteries for. The forest level has something worng with it when it comes to batteries, even when you get them as the reward you still don't get any. The knife is also a joke and lets not forget about the spiders that can shoot you through trees and dirt.Other then that the game has okay story progression and the graphics look great. just needs a little fine tuning.

One of the few VR titles that feels fully fleshed out and thoughtfully crafted. Even with nearly 20 hours of play, I still find it viscerally unnerving to see dimly-lit monsters approaching you when you're out of flashlight battery life. The binaural audio is also dialed-in, so you can really pinpoint where the monsters are with uncanny accuracy, which really adds to the immersion. Sounds effects are superb as well.Now for the nitpicks:I wished the developers did away with the laser sight altogether. It makes the campaign mode very easy to complete. We had an incredibly difficult (but fun) time trying to beat the initial lab level until we discovered the laser sight. Once we acquired that, we got through all four waves without taking any damage.The sound designer could've shelved out/lowered the ultra-low frequencies (probably under 40hz) with the revolver (our favorite). It tends to overload/crackle my Bose QC25 headphones, which are pretty balanced consumer-grade cans when it comes to frequency response. A true nitpick.In survival mode, the Town Square map is too easy -- especially with the revolver. I wished the difficulty REALLY ramped up as you progressed in that map (and no, that doesn't mean more of the annoying, tiny snorting baddies). In its current state, we got to wave 20+ without much difficulty (especially with the revolver). Only idea I have is to exponentially add to the onslaught and maybe have the 'rushing' monsters already sprinting at you!That's really it for nitpicks.I would love to see this title expanded with more content, which I would gladly pay for. More levels, more monsters, continued story, etc. Brookhaven Experiment: Aftermath, or something. :)"

The game is not perfect, but the dev is listening  and responding and already released a couple of updates. People with 970's should stay away. My gtx 780ti OC was chugging so much playing this game, it is clearly not optimised. However, on my new gtx 1080 it runs buttery smooth.The game is essentially a much more polished Hordez, where there is absolutely no movement, instead playing in different environments killing zombies that come in waves.The tone is much more action shooter, with lots of breaks before waves with score and weapon loadout, rather than horror...despite what you have seen on video. Ammo is aplenty, aiming is made ultra easy with the laser attachment  received early on in the game and the torch has enough juice to never run out. Don't get me wrong, I do jump sometimes when a zombie sneaks up behind me... but that has more to do with poor 3d sound placement then true scares.However I can recommend this game. Most VR games on steam are pretty disposable. 30 mins, 1 hour and then onto the next thing. I am not sure if this game will change that paradigm, but at 1.6 hours I feel like there is still a lot more for me to see here. Without a difficulty setting or a meaningful score board, I can't imagine replaying earlier levels in its current state. However the dev is active and I am sure the gameplay will be tweaked to make a difficulty or different modes that can solve this."

This is the kind of horror shooter I have been waiting for.  At first, it's pretty scary.  Once you get used to it, it's not so bad- until you start hearing the multiple different enemies inch closer to you at the same time.  That is panic inducing.  I now know what it feels like in those horror movies where the person about to be swarmed points there gun at a different enemy over and over unable to decide on a target to shoot.   I think I am in the last third of the story mode and at the end of each wave I find myself holding my chest.  I feel hot even in an air conditioned room.  When I survive (or die) after a very difficult situation, I find my hands shaking.Gameplay wise, there's a considerable amount of content.  There are 6 weapons (if I remember correctly) in the game.  I have only personally used 2 because I want to try and beat the game first with just the main pistol.   I have gotten far with it, but in the later levels it is becoming quite hard to survive using it.  I have also played with the revolver a little bit because it makes me feel like Rick Grimes.  There are a surprising number of enemy types in this game.  You also have throwables and gear that you can change on a per wave basis.  I think it would be cool if you could switch weapons on the fly ala-Dead Space style but I don't think the mechanics quite support it.There are downsides as well.  This game needs a very strong GPU.  I am using a GTX 1080.  With that I almost never feel like I have dropped frames, but sometimes SteamVR will show the ""Application running slowly pop-up.  Previously I had a GTX 980 and with that I sometimes got dropped frames.  From what I see in the Vive CPU readout, this game doesn't require a high-end CPU.  I have an i5-4670k overclocked to 4.4 ghz and for the most part the CPU readout showed I was within the recommended CPU performance range.There are some bugs, balance issues,  and wonky things.  I've had waves never end presumably because an enemy got stuck somewhere out of site.  I can't use the stun grenade throwable because it always crashes my game and Sometimes enemies get launched into the sky briefly.  The devs seem to be working on these issues as I have seen them respond in the forums.In terms of balance issues,  it seems to be pretty common to be in 1 of 2 groups of people.  The people who have good aim and stockpile a HUGE amount of ammo, and the group of people who are usually starved for bullets.  I can't think of a way to circumvent this, but I find this to be a balance issue.  There are also some equipment that may or may not be too strong/too weak.  Meleeing is wonky to me and I typically just swim my arms repeatedly in front of me.I consider this game not for the faint of heart.  I have a *very* difficult time persuading some of my friends to play it cause they are too scared.  This game almost satisfies my horror shooter craving.  I say almost because I still want a VR version of a ""House of the Dead-esque"" experience."

So even as other people have posted thier own issues with what seems to be a lack of content, or interesting mechanics; you need to take a step back and ask what YOU really want from this.  This is NOT a grand adventure or super interesting story that will grip you for the rest of your life.  (however the story seems to be a inspired from the movie ""The Mist"", which is kinda neat).What this game gives you is a gun.  You pul the trigger and nail the mutant monster.

After playing the demo for hours on end I was greated to increased atmospheric graphics more choice of weapons and upgrades as well as throwable weapons. The Levels are varied plus the combat grows with difficulty with each level. Though its not perfect, its one of the better zombie shooters on for the Vive on the Steam store.So far the only problems that I have with this game are;1. The sound can sometimes be buggy. It doesn't always have 3d surround sound, sometimes gunfire only comes from one speaker on the headphones ( Corsair 7.1 void ).2. In some levels it can be too dark, so dark your flash light will have no effect.3. The gun recoil is so strong that you will feel a disconnect between your VR gun and your controller making you think your controls are out of sync and this can be very distracting, there is an attachment that I always use for this ( muzzle that lessens the recoil ) but it would be nice to use the laser pointer or the gun light, but the recoil is too much for me so I have to use the muzzle attachment.4. The Survival mode only has 3 levels from the campaign mode, and since the campaign mode shares the same gameplay mechanics as survival but with less waves, there is absolutely no reason why there are only 3 levels for survival, there should be more! This will really hamper longevity conisdering they are the darkest and most uninteresting levels in the game.5. The menu selection buttons that are highlighted on your tourch and your gun can be very distracting because, since the game is so dark these menu buttons are too bright and therefore create god rays within the headset especially when you are trying to look down the sights of your gun. Its very distracting,6. The menu selection buttons on the tourch and the gun ( to select between your knife and weapons ) are VERY slow to navigate when you are in the heat of battle. Since other VR games have you reach behind you to switch weapons why can't we do it here?Other than these 6 bugs/game design that I have come across, the game is very good and is worth the €20 price tag. I just wish the developer fixes a few of these bugs off this list, if they do, this game will be outstanding!"

The pistols all shoot too slow for the spammy late-game levels. Shotgun ammo is so scarce that the SMG is the only weapon you'll be able to use for most of the last half of the campaign-You still have to spend severalhoursgrinding earlier campaign levels to earn enough shotgun and SMG ammo to get through the last two levels-Throwable weapons are too rare and too difficult to throw accurately. They have some crap-garbage physics and you have to throw completely differently than you would in any other game-During the gear selection before each wave, you can't change your weapon after you initially pick it. You can change everything else but not your weapon-Each time you switch between the laser sight and the muzzle brake, it permanently moves the gun backwards and up about an inch-The ammo icon for the SMG is a flashbang-The Survival mode isn't balanced. In Survival, you earn currency based on decapitations and instakills (there are other categories but they give you so little currency they are meaningless). After a few waves, when you start fighting larger enemies, you can't get decapitations or instakills because the enemies have too much health/can't be decapitated. The only weapons powerful enough to kill the larger enemies are so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly expensive they can't pay for themselves. Basically what this means is that in Survival all you can use for the first 4 or 5 waves is the starting pistol, then you get one wave with the shotgun or revolver, and the next wave you're back to the starting pistol and die.Overall, the game is very unpolished.

Your tools for the job is a flashlight and a couple of weapons you unlock by finding boxes. You also get some upgrades for the weapons. There's two type of games: Campaign that follows a story, and survival where you kill wave after wave of incomming monsters.The positivies:- Does what it's suppose to, scare you.- Fun shooting the zombies.- Different weapons, ammo and upgrades for weapons.- Good amount of different monsters.The negatives:- Could be better graphics- Could be better animations.- It doesn't feel right when you shoot. In the game you have recoil, but your aim with the controllers don't have recoil.- It's basically the same over and over, so it quickly becomes boring.Even if it has some negatives, it definitvly is worth the experience. It's also a good game to introduce your friends to VR, if you like watching them♥♥♥♥♥♥their pants. However, if this wasn't a VR game I would never recommend it. A problem with most VR games is that they are short, bad graphics, unfinished, bad animations etc. This game also has some of those problems, but somehow playing things in VR makes all those things more forgiving. I'm still waiting for a big game that will keep me interested for days, with decent graphics, animations, story and a intersting world though, and this is not it."

,Recommended,440630,30292031,Posted: 3 March,all,Wildt,"This is afaik one of the first VR FPS non-locomotion/teleportation wave shooters. It was designed for the Vive which means 360/roomscale, so you'll be a bit handicapped with a 180 Rift setup, but there's a 180 turn button, so it's still playable regardless.The theme is horror - creepy monsters in poorly lit surroundings. It really does a good job at getting your adrenaline going. Turning around franticly with your flashlight trying to spot the monsters before they get too close.In a game like this, the visual fidelity plays a huge part in making the theme work effectively. For instance, I don't find Dreadhalls scary simply because of the poor graphics. Brookhaven's presentation gets the job done - but only just. While the models are generally decent, the terrain is very low poly, so it all looks pretty flat despite bumpmapped textures. The animations are also subpar, and in no way influenced by the terrain, so monsters walking up a slope that ends with a steep edge will be airwalking for a bit, which was forgiveable in a Doom clone in 1995, but it absolutely kills the atmosphere/immersion here.Don't get me wrong - it's still scary and creepy. The big spiders totally freaked me out. When one got close I seriously had to turn around and shoot it over my shoulder the first many times it happened, while the hairs stood tall on my arms :)Sound effects are good, and the guns feel great.The ""AI"" is so poor that even though it's pretty much only designed to make the monsters come at you in a straight line, they sometimes get stuck in the environment. E.g. a zombie walking in place because of a waist high, 1m wide rock. Once again a big immersion killer.There are upgrades/items/weapons hidden throughout the maps in the form of little crates you have to spot and shoot. Imo there's a totally overpowered item in there: The flare gun. Fire this baby close to your feet and everything within a great radius is brightly lit, so you can see the monsters a mile away for the duration of the wave. The graphics look awful in this cold cyanish light as well and annihilates all remaining scaryness.Bottom line: A decent wave shooter that does a great job at scaring you until you find the flaregun.70%"

76561197997374644,Recommended,440630,31451879,Posted: 29 April,all,harlequin,"I played the demo a lot, and completed the game when it first game out.  It was definitely the best wave shooter around when first released, and it took me about 6 hours to get through all of the content - I had to repeat some of the levels quite a few times, and I recommend trying out different weapons if you are having trouble getting through a section.  There are a variety of monsters and they can come at you from 360 degrees, but each level has fixed paths that the monsters follow, so you get an idea of where they are going to come from, and the audio gives good hints as to what type of monsters are around.  The locations are dark, so you'll need to use your torch (held in your off hand) to see, although this has limited battery life, so you can't keep it on all of the time.There a number of phases for each location and you get one shooting weapon, a torch, a couple of upgrade options and one off-hand single use weapon.  If you die during any of the phases, you'll need to restart the location from the first phase, and within each location there are ""secret"" chests that you can shoot to provide new weapons or upgrades in the following phase.  I could never reliably use the off-hand weapon so I ended up never using them (although this may have been fixed in subsequent patches).The last boss is very epic"

Survival mode is a really good game mode to play if you have a friend or two over and are taking turns playing. The scenery is all really well made, keeping it dark enough to be creepy, with enough light and detail to make you wonder wtf happened here when you look around. The audio design is perfect, if you're wearing headphones you can tell when there's something coming up behind you (most of the time)  Like any wave shooter it can get repetitive, but that's more a fault of the genre than the game itself.I rate this game 2.8/5 crusty beans."

You get one position and you must hold it down against an onslaught of nightmarish creatures. The story telling could use some work. While it isn't entirely without substance, some of the delivery is a bit bland. I would like to see this series evolve further. After playing some VR FPS with like Arizona Sunshine and Serious Sam VR The First Encounter, I hope any sequels will borrow some of their ideas on local motion to offer a more immersive world. Regardless if you enjoyed old light gun games (video game or old gallery style) I encourage you to check this game out."

It gets all the basics right and it is a good first VR game.The reason you probably wanted to play a VR game is the immersive aspects of VR; this game delivers.  You can't move around to explore any of the scenes, but each scene is beautiful and creepy.  The various waves of monsters are varied and sometimes suprising.   There's enough replayabiilty that  one might want to go back and try different stratigies with different weapon combos.I'm probably the only person that cares about this: having grown up near Brookhaven National Labs I have to say this looks nothing like BNL or Long Island in general."
,Recommended,440630,29890126,Posted: 12 February,all,eNomineZerum,"This was the first real game I played on the Vive. It is also the game that drove me to purchase the GTX 1070, GTX 1060 laptop when I realised I didn't have enough room by my desktop, clean out an area of my house and eventually buy the darn Vive.That being said this is an excellent game with a good amount of depth. You start off with a simple pea shooter and must manage your resources as you proceed through the game. A few time I got totally stuck and then realized that I just needed to use my tools in a more efficient and structured way.This being said a few pointers follow here... Keep an eye out for unlocks, stock up on special ammo when you can unless you really need health, save special ammo for ""oh crap"" moments when the enemies are bearing down on you.Overall this game is a solid 7/10. For first timers it will show what the Vive can do but once you have put some time in it shows just how shallow it is. The main story is roughly 10-20 hours unless you want to retread the same levels on a harder difficulty which is only possible with some of the weapons unlocked later on in the game. The ending, which I hoped to be the culmination of something, ultimately is short lived and extremely anti-climatic. Anti-Climatic in the vein of watching a high speed chase where the perp just stops as a red light, gets out and lays down on the ground."

Made the last level a blast.Let's start this review.GRAPHICS: not the best around, but the lighting and creepy ambiance goes hand in hand to deliver a great experience, and i feel heavily immersed in the levels, especially anything storm drain level and after. I've read other reviews where some complain but i play on basic resolution levels and its more than good. 8/10GAMEPLAY: Not the longest game in terms of the campaign but certainly thrilling and fluid. I don't feel like im hindered in my movements and the action/feel/suspense of the game is all there. I had loads of fun! 9/10SOUND: Creepy. If its not the moaning of a shambling grunt, it's a jurrasic park sounding stomp or the pitter  patter of children or my least personal favorite, the skurrying of multiple legs in the dark. These sounds along with the gentle fire cracklings or low key lab sounds make for a nice enviorment and as i've stated before, I felt heavily immersed. 9/10Critiques: More levels and power ups in future games or DLC, other than that, great game as is!Final Thoughts: Great game!

It's a pretty simple game. Stand in place and shot things that come at you. There is a campaign mode with a storyline that I have yet to get through because it gets a lot harder the farther you go. This game demonstrates that horror games are *much* scarier in VR than on a number computer. On a normal computer this game wouldn't be scary at all. In VR it's unnerving so I have to quit after a hour of so of play and take a break for a few days. :-)
