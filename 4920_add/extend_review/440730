,Not Recommended,440730,22569466,"Posted: 22 April, 2016",all,[BS] Lol U Mad,"Neither intense nor expansive.Too early to be considered a game and not even worth the $2.99. You can see more in pretty much any demo of any game ever made. Thumbs down until there is some form of actual gameplay. I don't recommend tech demos.The videos are a pretty accurate depiction of what you get with this game. In fact thats ALL you get with this game. They have shown EVERYTHING in the game,  the only difference is you don't start with an axe or a flamethrower. According to the developer these can be found in crates (I didn't find any).Multiplayer consists of one server with a building and some boxes. No players or zombies and no terrain at all.Single player is a small underground bunker with a few ""zombies"" that kill you IN ONE HIT. You don't have a weapon so no gameplay there unless you consider running from zombies until you get cornered in a 3 bedroom bunker gameplay (or you manage to find a weapon). Well hey, it worked for Pac-Man.You can exit the bunker but you end up in an unpopulated terrain with a couple of buildings and nothing else (although I hear there might be animals around).The interface and ui is more complete than most early access games. Keymapping works and you can turn off the music.There is some potential but when developers release things like this so early I have nagging doubts, although to be fair the developer did respond to this review and posted a patch to the game so those are good signs."

You are correct.  There are random T-Rex roars in the background for seemingly no reason.  Probably has to do with the fact that the other game this developer made was a dinosaur hunting game.-The Campaign mode is just really easy survival rounds each level having 3 waves, the first two waves are zombie waves having on average 3 zombies, and the last wave is the boss zombie.  Very easy, no challenge.-Guns are clunky and don't move when you fire them.-The campaign mode is somewhat new and needs work.  Right now  ""Campaign Placeholder"" is on the intermediary slides between levels instead of a title.This game is still early access and it seems like the developer has been making semi-regular updates, so we'll see where this game goes.EDIT(After Developer Comment and game update): Ok so the developer actually listened and fixed quite a few things that I was complaining about.  It's nice to see a developer who is active in improving his/her game.  Anyways,-Guns are now the correct size!-The Map is very much improved, well done.-The campaign no longer has placeholders for the transition slides and is improved overall with number of enemies-There still isn't a very big community playing online, but if it keeps updating and more servers(or the ability to host servers) are made available then I can definitely see more people playing it."

,Not Recommended,440730,30111155,Posted: 22 February,all,Reaper ♡,"Overall rating:2/10- Where do I start off with this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game?Campaign:I really should put this in quotation marks, the supposed 'campaign' isn't really a campaign at all. From my experience, you don't even start off at level 1 and each level is randomized. To complete the campaign, you need to clear 8 levels and it should take around 30-40 minutes. Anyway, each level has 2 waves of zombies, usually split into 2 groups and a boss. You start off the game with every weapon (minus a few which I found to be exclusive to the tutorial) falling from the sky in 1 place, so you pick up every weapon because why not? The zombies spawn one at a time for some reason and the boss is just a large zombie with more health, aside from one boss which is literally just a walking zombie on fire.AI:The AI is beyond terrible, the zombies (or whatever they are supposed to be) just walk in a straight line at a slow pace, so even a 2 year old wouldn't have trouble playing this game. It's nearly impossible to die unless you stand still doing nothing. You can at least deal headshots to insta-kill enemies, although they explode into messy horrible gibs.Weapons:The weapon selection is surprisingly nice. You have real life weapons such as the M4, AK, Striker, KSG and many more. There are around 30 or so weapons to choose from, though I found myself using the Revolver the most as it seems to be nearly 1 shot kill to the body most of the time. You shouldn't find yourself running out of ammo on any mission because if you're like me, you will cycle between all the weapons as it gets boring using the same weapon over and over again. P.S. The rocket launchers and the melee weapons suck, just don't bother using them.Multiplayer:As to be expected, there is no one playing this game online so I can't say much about it. There is a server browser if you ever happen to find people hosting multiplayer games which is a nice touch. You can play co-op with friends if you both want to waste time and feel the urge to drink bleach without physically doing so.Controls:Even in a game as bad as this, at least you are given the option to change your key bindings however you feel. The only thing I can't change that annoys me is that there is no option to change the aiming from toggle to hold, but I got used to it. Trying to build structures using the function keys is seriously bugged and broken, but it is still do-able to some extent, though I never found a use for doing so.In conclusion, the reason I gave this game a rating of 2 instead of a 1 is because I actually found myself playing this game for an hour. I do like the weapon choice and the customizable controls, however that's all this game has going for itself. The maps seem bland and unfinished, the interface is beyond horrible and other reasons listed above. In all honesty, I would only buy this game for it's easy 400-odd achievements."

This game have +800 achievements and is based in same gameplay and idea ofDinosaur Hunt, only instead of killing dinos, you'll kill zombies. This game is, literally, a copy-paste. There are no more differences.Gameplay.The 'Campaign' isn't really a campaign. You don't even start off at level 1 and each level is randomized. To complete the campaign, you need to clear 8 levels and it should take around a half hour. Each level has two waves of zombies, split into two groups and a boss. The boss isn't truly a boss, it's just a large zombie with a little more health. You can build small wood structures, but I don't know for what. At least I didn’t build any and I finished the game.The AI is too weak, close of horrible. Zombies walk in a straight line with at a slow pace, that are easy to kill. You have guns like M4, AK, Striker, KSG and many more. However, they’re clunky. You can carry three guns at the same time, all with limited munition, so you don't have infinite ammo. However, you have always weapons available on the ground, so you basically have infinite ammo. There is no kind of challenge. To you die it's too hard. You need to be surrounded by a lot of zombies and, even so, you don't die easily. You can run to other position and continue to kill them. This is basically what this game represents.There are a ridiculous amounts of achievements unlocked very quickly. It seems to me that a lot of them are unlocked randomly, I don't know how. And the name of each achievement is completely silly, no sense, at all.Your screen will practically be flooded with achievements as you play. If you turning on a flashlight, you'll unlock one achievement, if you kill one zombie, just one, you'll unlock a lot of achievements, etc. You don't need to be good at shooting. All you do is a reason to unlock achievements, no sense.You want smile a little? Ok, then. If you hear a roar like a T-Rex, yes, it's possible and you isn't confused, is really a roar of a T-Rex. You're correct. There are random T-Rex roars in the background for seemingly no reason. Probably has to do with the fact that the other game (Dinosaur Hunt), that, as I said before, was made by the same dev.As inDinosaur Hunt, you have a radar at the top right of the screen to locate and track zombies. As in other game, the maps seem bland and unfinished, and the interface is so bad. The multiplayer? Well, is nonexistent. There aren't players to play.The only positive point in this game is for an achievement hunter, otherwise, this game don't deserve your time. And the price of the game, well, is ridiculous.Positive points. (+)Awful game, but if you want to boost your achievement stats, try it. 885 achievements unlocked in a few minutes.Negative points. (-)Firstly, the price of the game is an insult. Buy it in a sale, as I did.Gameplay is mediocre.AI is a joke.Guns are a little clunky.Sounds of dinosaurs in background (lol).Bad optimization.Some achievements seems to be unlocked randomly, without no sense.Supposedly, there is multiplayer but it's nonexistent."

Yes it has crafting, but why? Zombies rarely hurt you and there are so many guns you never run out of bullets.Yes there is a thirst and hunger meter, but you will easily wipe out the horde long before it becomes an issue.There is a day and night cycle, but again it adds nothing to the game. And yes it has base building but you will never have the time to build anything, nor will you ever have the need to either.And despite the developers attempt to add content by means of different gamemodes the entire game still boils down to a basic wave based shooter - kill two waves then kill boss. Repeat ad nauseum. Over and over. Add to this some pretty poor ingame performance, ugly visuals and zombies that often walk through solid objects.Buy left 4 dead 2 if you want a great zombie shooter experience, because this one is utterly average at best."

,Recommended,440730,30065051,Posted: 20 February,all,Birckk,"Worth it for the achievementsSo if you didn't know. The developer ""Racing Bros"" has made a series of games including this in which you are able to get thousands of achievements in mere hours. The achievements are made so that you'll get achievements from each kill, headshots and some standard achievements etc. All of these games are primarily the same with the exception of the opponents/enemies and maps. To everyone saying these games are good or bad let me state this. These games have a clear purpose and you are either against that purpose or not. The games are what they are, and aren't meant to be some AAA title or anything like that and are not made for the gameplay experience. These games are for having some fun with some bad physics and insane explosions when killing enemies. They aren't meant to be played for a very long time and that's really fair considering the really low price of these games and what the reason to play them are. All in all these games are solely for the achievements and maybe having a small laugh and that's why you should buy this game and nothing else. I personally found the games fun, and they did feel a little grindy of course but nothing I didn't like or mind.Some zombie shooting. There are five different zombies and some bosses and a few maps. If you seek achievement have you come to the right zombie massacre sim."

I'm not even a fan of the zombie genre however I do like the personalized Achievement idea that the developer has going so I do support buying it if you're interested in stuff like that.The game itself is pretty easy. Zombies might not be undead but simply people sleeping since it took them forever to show up in small groups just to be eliminated by your endless arsenal of weapons and ammunition. No idea why there is a crafting/building option in the game either. Levels are cleared after two small waves and an easy boss fight.In the end I won't give a negative since I got what I wanted out of it. Consider what you want for yourself!

,Recommended,440730,31449710,Posted: 29 April,all,Kostas1500,"{Disclaimer: I bought this game at the price of 0,50 €}First of all i want to mention, that the main reason i got this game is the custom achievements feature! Which i find awesome and unique, and if you want to buy the game just for that , then go ahead and do it (up to a price point of 1€)A second reason on why you might want to buy this game , is for the 460+ achievements that it has, that you can unlock in about 30 mins. So it is also worth it for ""Perfect Game"" collectors !+It has steam cards that you can get and even sell for like almost the hole price of the game (for me at least, which was 50 cents).And last but not least, is that the game is actually kind of fun! For the almost hour that i played it, i really did enjoy killing those zombies, even if the AI and their difficulty kinda sucks!Anyways my total opinion, is that this game is worth it for up to a dollar/euro. Now if you can't find it in that price i suggest you wait for a sale or you don't buy the game at all, especially if you aren't interested in the hole custom achievement thingy!"

,Recommended,440730,30999039,Posted: 7 April,all,Gnarl,"This is a zombie survival FPS where you start out with a huge selection of weapons ranging from RPGs to miniguns, from crossbows to M-16s, and from pistols to sniper rifles. The point of this game is to kill all the zombies and stay alive until the next round and try and keep up with the extremely dull story-line. All in all I say this is an ok survival shooter and really out does the other games in the series (Dinosaur Hunt, Dinosaur Forest, Machine Hunt) although after an hour or two this game gets quite repetitive, its the same thing over and over again and starts to feel like a chore to keep blowing up zombiesyou can kill the bosses with 1 hit from the RPG"

,Not Recommended,440730,34542908,Posted: 27 August,all,~Imagine Creativity~,"When it comes to cheap zombie survival games i love them they always have there own twist and fun to them, with this game its not the case this is a game with bland uninteractible maps that are annoying to navigate and guns the spawn right in front of you but the guns arnt diffrent the rpg has to hit a zombie head on just to kill it and it only kills 1 zombie at a time the maps are escapble and boring the zombies spawns are all levels of mesed up they spawn right in front of you and there always 1 shot kill unless its a boss the its like 3 shots with no diffrence or fun to them at all.SOLOits boring there is just running around killing zombies and then a loading screen to another map they attempt to make a campaign from this but it doesnt work out it turns into a buggy weird game that is akward to play.MULTIPLAYERI at first had no problem with this part we laughed at the zombies for a bit and stuff but then my friend started running into issues the guns for the second player rarley spawn in making the player useless after like 3 rounds and the zombies only go after the host they dont attack the secondary player at all making the multiplayer useless and boring since player 1 has to do everything.I do not recoment this game i got it on sale for 40 cents and i still feel ripped off i do not recoment this game to anyone who wants to enjoy there time."

,Recommended,440730,35244720,Posted: 27 September,all,Kahvii ja kakkuu,AchievementsI got this game in a bundle which included this and 3 similar games. These games are essentially a reskin of each other with thousands of achievements. Like at least 3 per killed enemy. Good for achievement hunters. Buy the whole bundle for a couple of euros and grab the achievements! Also included a couple of trading cards and a fairly good soundtrack which is essentially the same in all 4 games. These games are fun for like 10 minutes when you're just wondering what on earth is going on. Entertaining in a way. Don't buy for a good playing experience.
