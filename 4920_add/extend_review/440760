,Recommended,440760,31464544,Posted: 30 April,all,CorvusCorax,"A simplistic, fast-paced top-down shooter which reminded me of the good-old tank shooter called Combat (this is a very old game released back in the '70s on Atari). This is a great example that good games can be made with the use of Unity.This is a no brainer - you eliminate all the rival tanks (I know they are cubes but due to nostalgia I could only see all cubes as military vehicles) in order to complete a level. Since the game is fast-paced an hour or so is enough to complete all 75 stages.Although the graphics are simple some extra effects I would have loved to see such as explosions. Also, while including factories that keep spawning enemies is a great idea after 10 stages or so you have seen everything there is to see - no new enemies are introduced later on.This is a great little game if you have a couple of hours to kill."

I do not advise buying it unless you have pretty decent reflexes and can look past ridiculously unfair odds. I barely made it to the 5th level without rage-quitting but its a decent basic game nonetheless. I suppose this is the game for you if you want a challenge for a cheap price.

This game is probably one of my favorite simple, top-down style games ive played. My only complaint is how short it is. 75 levels may seem to be a relatively large amount, but i personally found that once you got a hang of the game, you could complete levels in only a few minutes, regardless of whether or not it was a higher stage or not. The difficulty did not seem to be evenly distributed and it felt like you did not have to improve at the game to continue on to higher levels.I would recommend this to anyone that wants a simple game that doesnt take much thinking about to play in their spare time."

,Not Recommended,440760,31293683,Posted: 22 April,all,MpoMp,Pretty basic arcade game. Neat for its price but could use some extra modes or powerups. It gives no incentive to keep playing whatsoever. I'd only recommend to hardcore fans of the genre and achievement hunters.

And i would say it needs some gameplay improvements.no, its not a bad game, it just could be better since there are times that feel kind of a nuisance-The shots from the turrents and the basic cube enemy are hard to see+The shots from the really tough mobs are easy to see-Every enemy just shoots where you stand, simply dont stand where they shoot and you can just not look at the projectiles and you are still pretty much sure you will live. AKA ""keep sidestepping""+One exemption, the spinning turrets are harder to deal with since they have hard to see shots and are very random in where they shoot.-No boss levels, there was probably not enough motivation to keep on going if you wont give the player at least something surprising to look forward to.-No achievements. maybe at least 1 achievement for beating the game?"

This game requires quite a lot of dodging skills when you are in a higher level. But it i actually quite fun you move around quickly hover your body around shooting turrets detroying the spawners and more  just to win. Wait, did u ask me to rate this game? i would say 9/10, yes, thats how fun this game is."
,Recommended,440760,32697282,Posted: 23 June,all,Whateverman,"The concept of the game is very simple: shoot stuff that's shooting back at you.  Some of it is mobile, some is not; some is better armored than you are, and some fire in different patterns.  Your little destroyer is generally a little faster than everything else, and there are walla you can (and must) use to your advantage.Think of it as a slightly more colorful throwback to the old Atari2600 game style.  Only basic strategies are needed - but you HAVE to use them well.Still, 1.5 hours after I'd started playing this, my mouse finger was locked in pain, trying to keep firing as much and as accurately possible.  No, this bullet-hell game wont win awards, but I found it strangely compelling.I really wish there were achievments, because I think that'd make it MORE compelling.  Also, a way to customize your playlist would be nice.  It's easy enough to mute the music and play your own, but havcing everything contained in a single package would make it feel more slick.  Finally, a small number of powerups, or maybe a secondary weapon/ability would rule.I'll recommend this because it's simple, inexpensive and appeals to my ""retro sensibilities"" - and it's surprisingly fun."
,Recommended,440760,33171836,Posted: 3 July,all,Nyphoot,"Not the worst game in the world; has pretty fun gameplay all things considered. Great for playing during queue times for games like Dota or League, or if you just have 5 minutes to kill. I enjoyed that even the smallest of enemies could one hit kill you, which keeps you on your toes. The only thing I would say is there's a lot of missed potential - stuff like upgrades etc. that you would see in any good flash game of a similar style are missing.One tip to anyone playing: it's much easier to react moving horizontally across a level than vertically, due to more screen space.For the 9p I spent on it (-90% coupon from a Steam level up) it was worth it. Overall I would say pick it up with a coupon or on sale if you can, I beat it in <2hrs so there's not a huge amount of content, but 40p during a sale for 100 mins of pretty fun gameplay is fine."
,Recommended,440760,33945120,Posted: 1 August,all,TheSlimeLord,"To be honest the game was much more fun than my orginal expectations when buying the game. But then again I honestly wasn't expecting much. I did get the game for a insanely cheap price so I don't feel I wasted money.With a total of 75 levels, cube destroyer is a game where... uhh... a blue cube kills other cubes? There is no real story at all, just gameplay. Either way I find it a fun game to play in short sessions. Definitely not a game to spend hours playing in one session. The game can easily get boring if you spend too much time. The graphics aren't the best but what did you expect from a game about a blue cube shooting other red cubes?In Conclusion...Good game for short play sessions."
