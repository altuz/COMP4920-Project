76561198062526269,Recommended,441050,23589815,"Posted: 15 June, 2016",all,Swarm of Rats,"A fun, comical, charming game of skill, prediction and chance.Guide Polandball to space, avoid other hassling countries and try not to be held back by the gravity of larger nations such as Russia, China and Canada.Collect fuel to reach your dreams in the sky, eat burgers to keep your health up, and collect money so you can stop using kitchenware as a rocket.Its not all struggle though, occationally netherland ball or sometimes a jamaica ball will help you get higher... in various ways.For $3 or less its pretty well worth it. You will get more satisfaction out of this than you will the bag of chips you would otherwise buy."
76561197990089402,Not Recommended,441050,24643566,"Posted: 31 July, 2016",all,Pride,"The only reason I gave this a negative review  is that see so much improvements that could have been done here.The biggest flaw I see is the scalabilty in the game, it's no use to go higher and higher, more efficent to go slow and sideways in order to gain as much gold as possible, no rewards depending on height.And this makes it feel like the ""fun"" of the game is missing.Easy solution would be to give a chunk of gold depending on the height you reached, just need to make it scale with the upgrade tree cost, not that difficult.You also have a perk and a space ship parts to upgrade from the start, makes it a bit confusing to know what you should go for, generally it's better to go for the spaceship as  the perks only increase in % in the stats.A better idea would be to have the perk tree locked untill the parts are done, increases game play and more fun to invest time in it.Also the only power buff you can increase worth in from the perk tree is the gold, can't do it for the others.There's also just 4 powerbuffs, makes every run more predicitable and incredable repetative. Easy solution here would be to have rare's that gives increase in gold,health,fuel etc. and to increase the worth of the powerbuffs depending on height.After a few runs it gets very boring, why limit it so much?TL:DRFeels like alpha stageVery blandDoesnt feel rewarding to keep playing.Love the rest though, graphic wise, the puns from the balls, those extra bits.Game creators should had focused more time on the engine and less on the details, maybe updates will come but doubt it will happen any time in recent future."

Too be honest, i'm getting sick of people making Polandball without it actually being Polandball.-Not handdrawn, everything is too neat and tool like you guys should've drawn the characters by mouse with no tools. That is one of the things that makes Polandball special is the effort it takes to make a comic. I mean damn, i've drawn pictures myself ITS NOT THAT DAMN HARD.-Sadly the game is like a flash game, theres not much to say game play wise, you fly a ship upwards, collect♥♥♥♥♥♥ upgrade your♥♥♥♥♥♥ and land on the moon.I really REALLY hate to say it but I just cannot recommend this game even if you're a Polandball fan at heart.

Do you enjoy rocket-launching games that often end in disaster like Kerbal Space Program?Yes to both?Well then strap yourself in, lift off and hope Romania doesn't suck your health dry on your way to glory.No to both?Nothing to see here then, you probably won't understand nor enjoy this.Halfway between?Have a shot at it.You start off with a (VERY) basic rocket, but can upgrade both the components and your stats along the way. Once you launch, you have to try to collect health, money, fuel etc. and go as far as you possibly can. Once you run out of health or fuel, BOOM, back to the start to spend the coin you collected on upgrades. Launch again, go further, learn from your mistakes, break your previous best score. Rinse and repeat.It's a little repetitive, both in gameplay and music, but for a couple of bucks I got a chuckle and wasted some time.It doesn't try to pretend it's a huge game with infinite replay value so for what it is, 6/10."

So, let's go.PROS- Very well made for being based on such an obscure comic series- Jokes and stereotypes are funny- Controls are easy to get used to- Upgrade and Part system is well-priced- Worth the money- Achievements are not too hard to getCONS- Belgium's AI- Ending should have had an ironic twist (involving Russia/USSRball)- Repetitive soundtrack (easily solveable by muting music)- NO SEALAND!!!!!! (just a joke)In short, I wholly recommend this game. It's well worth $3.Just one glitch I found- occasionally speech bubbles will show up on the wrong countryball... I suppose that's a minor scripting error, nothing gamebreaking."
