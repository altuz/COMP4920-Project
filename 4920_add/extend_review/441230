This game really shows off the tracking system as you have to be really accurate. What the developers have done is vibrate the controllers when what you are holding comes into contact with other objects. This greatly improves immersion and makes you think that there actually are blocks you are trying to poke. Great humor, lots of puzzles. Only downside is needing a minimum of a 2mx2m square."

But once you get a few stages into it, it's surprising how fun and addicting it is. The gameplay is sort of like Jenga, except your hands are replaced with various tools and weapons like axes, swords, chisels, and hammers. Some levels task you with knocking out a certain number of blocks without knocking off the top totem block, while others ask you to construct a stable tower using the blocks strewn about the level to hold up the totem. It's a great demonstration of the extreme precision of the Vive controllers, and encourages you to try things like sticking the blade of a sword through a gap of equal size between two blocks to wedge them apart. It's fun to play, fun to watch, funny, and also comparatively cheap for a VR launch game, so if you're planning your list of games to buy when you get your vive you might consider sticking this one in for a try."

The voice actor added to the feel of a more mature effort and was quite funny. The levels are all really different and dynamic. The only issue is the gripping in this game. Sometimes the blocks spin around like crazy which makes stacking hard. Definitely worth playing though!
,Recommended,441230,23712326,"Posted: 22 June, 2016",all,Solar,"This game is like jenga but way better. There are many types of unique blocks that do different things. There's one that explodes when touched, one that you cant touch (your hand just goes through it), one that is so heavy that you must whack it as hard as you can to move it, and a slippery block made of ice. And the developer says they plan to add even more, so I'm excited to see what kind of crazy new blocks are added. Also, you get to murder a bunch of little people by crushing them with blocks. This game is definitely worth buying, at only ten bucks it's way cheaper than most VR games."

Great production quality, and funny.  And the puzzles stay interesting by continually introducing new quirks.  All in all, I enjoy it and think I will easily get my money's worth from this game.  Nice job devs :)"
76561197971140093,Recommended,441230,22764380,"Posted: 2 May, 2016",all,TheCze,"In this giant Jenga game set in ancient greek, you play as some kind of tower safety inspector, modifying temples to the gods and making them appear a lot less safe. The game is still in Early Access but is already pretty polished and I encountered almost no bugs. I must have played about 10 to 15 levels, maybe more so far. Unfortunately don't know how many there. Already encountered six different kind of blocks. There are even tiny worshippers for you to smash with the building blocks (that's what safety inspectors do, right?). And before I forget it: The game has excellent voice narration that is genuinely funny! Be aware though that you'll need a playspace of at least 2mx2m! My 2xm3m space felt a bit too small at times."
,Not Recommended,441230,24005666,"Posted: 1 July, 2016",all,arleas,"Ok, so I've played a few levels of this now and I think I have enough to form an opinion.  It's basically 3D VR Jenga with an Ancient Greco/Roman/Babelonian theme to it.  The game starts out with an annoying tutorial and I say annoying because I didn't see any way to skip it once I had been through it already.  It's not so bad the first time around since you're going to need someone to explain how to play, but after that? I should be able to skip the tutorial.  Once you're past the tutorial it gives you the option to pick your levels though so that's nice.Completing some of the levels requires you to get down on your hands and knees so you can see the blocks you're trying to remove, and sometimes they give you a long spearlike tool to remove blocks and other times you have a sword, or a hammer and chisel.  You CAN use both hands though so you can use the shield hand to steady the blocks while your sword hand pokes a block out.Eventually you're given a pile of rubble (loose blocks) and you are told to build a tower as high as possible.  This kinda sounds interesting...like playing with building blocks in VR.  Unfortunately, grabbing each block feels clunky. You never have a firm grasp on it... instead it's like you're picking up a concrete slab with just your forefinger and thumb to hold it.  OK, so you need to use both hands right? Well now you're holding it the same way with both hands...or you're using an open hand to steady it while the other hand awkwardly grasps it.  Either way it does not feel like I'm grabbing it...it feels like I barely have control over it, and when you're building, it's a pain.Removing blocks with the various tools feels OK but sometimes even those are a bit awkward, especially on the parts where you have a long thin block to remove from the center of a pile and you have to kinda poke it out from under everything else.  I don't know if my virutal hand was banging the sides or what.After playing it for a bit though I kinda decided it was far too bland to keep playing.  It's Early access so it's got room to improve and add to the game, but right now I'd say pass unless you're just desperate to play jenga and don't want to clean up the blocks.Things I liked:there are people walking around the tower as you're removing blocks.  You can actually interact with these people (drop a block on them and kill them, smash them with your hammer, grab them with your hand and set them down on the top of the tower)It's entertaining for at least 10 or 15 minutes.Things I didn't like:At one point the narrator blathered on way too much about ""ha ha, you don't speak very much"".  The Gordon Freeman jokes are old dude... I know this is a game set in ancient times but do the jokes have to be ancient as well?At ANOTHER point I was frustrated and so I just slamed the beacon at the top off the tower.  At this point, the narrator yelled very loudly ""DISAPPOINTED!!!!"" which caught me off guard.Ther's no way to exit this game outside of hitting the steam menu button and saying ""EXIT"" and even then the game may hang instead of exitingThere's absolutely no music.  The graphics are PS1 level as well, so there's really not much to say about the game's presentation at this point.  I presume they're working on the game mechanics before they polish the graphics and sound.Mostly I was disappointed in how awkward it was trying to manipulate some of the blocks.  Removing them wasn't so bad since all you had to do was pry it out and make it drop.  Putting them in place though was awful.So yeah, pass on this.  It's got room to grow but it's still a ""toddler"" in terms of the life of a game."

The little people walking around your feet are enjoyable too, one can almost imagine strategy games of the future using this view, a god roaming earth to shape to their taste..."

I like the sense of humor given by the narrator and the haptics work well with the in game interactions.  Physics work how you would expect, giving you the option to balance some of the blocks on your tools or knock out a whole row with one quick swing.I have noticed that when you have the hand tools, some of the blocks swing around wildly unless you grab with both hands. Overall, the game plays like an amped up version of Jenga with an interesting theme.  I've only played a few levels so far, but the level design has been pretty varied.I would reccomend this game if you like Puzzles even in the slightest bit, as it is a lot of fun and seems to be great value for the price."

It was a great example of good haptics and immersion (and making you break that immersion to solve the harder puzzles) at vive launch, but it has gone nowhere in a year.abandonware"

The God is you. Don't make the tower fall. Awesome

I have a slightly smaller room (2.1 x 1.5) but it's nice that the dev thought of a way to solve this issue. Great game, but I notice that the controls are wobbly, which is not that big of an issue, unless you have to build something yourself, then no piece stands firmly.If the issue was solved, then great game!Oh and please a form of locomotion (teleport?) because sometimes I want to walk around a puzzle but cannot and I have to close the puzzle just to adjust the size."
