76561198003469036,Recommended,441280,32793367,Posted: 25 June,all,Dread Guacamole,"Pharaoh Rebirth+ is a fun and charming 2d Metroidvania platformer. It's set up as a series of relatively small but sprawling levels capped by boss fights, with the typical pickups and powerups for the genre; there isn't an unified map, but you can revisit finished levels once you're done with the current one to reach new areas with your new gadgets.The pixel art is great and very varied, and the game does a great job in mixing the gameplay up with new mechanics and threats, (simple) puzzles and unexpected minigame-like segments (though the driving level might be its biggest misstep).The cartoony tone and graphics might be a turn-off for some. It can also be very hard at times... I quickly gave up on getting all the collectibles, especially in the aforementioned driving bit, for example. But other than that this is a very strong recommendation - especially if you like this sort of thing."
,Recommended,441280,21948367,"Posted: 20 March, 2016",all,Shingo,"What's this?Pharaoh Rebirth+ takes the classic Japanese action/platform games from the 16/32-bit era and adds a ""metroidvania"" flair to it.The player takes control of Jonathan Banfield, an archaeologist that was cursed and turned into a silly rabbit.I stumbled upon this game just a few weeks before release and I was baffled by the overall lack of publicity and awareness of its existence. It's really a shame because there's so much care put into this work that might get overshadowed by tons of pointless ""retro"" platformers which come out every day.GameplayMechanics-wise, the game is pretty solid. There are various moves that can be executed from the start and others to be unlocked. Overall, combat works as intended and every enemy or boss has a dinstinct pattern that often intersects nicely with the level layouts.Player progression is not based on elements borrowed from RPG's like experience points or equipment, but instead rewards exploring and collecting the different, unique treasures scattered through the ruins and temples of Egypt.Instead of presenting itself with one, massive area that blocks your progress whenever you don't possess the right ability to get through, the game has a standard, stage-based structure. This helps in limiting both the backtracking factor and the typical ""fake sense of freedom"" of the genre.I found the level design to be quite clever, as it encourages exploration by showing the player unaccessible routes right from the start, but never requires to backtrack to a previous stage to get to the next. This means freedom of choosing  to get on with the story OR to go back and replay a chapter to get all the extra stuff which could come in handy, without being forced to revisit some old areas to get a mandatory powerup.The classic stage-based structure also makes it easier to carry out more action-oriented set pieces, like a helicopter pursuit or a mine car ride.Art DirectionTechnically speaking, Pharaoh Rebirth+ looks and sounds great. The high-res (640x480) nicely crafted and animated pixel art is matched by an upbeat, memorable soundrack which features an obvious Egyptian vibe. However, digitally painted character portraits that show up during radio chatter fall a bit short, as they look detached from the overall style and don't really match its quality.I recommend playing the game using its original 4:3 ratio, as stretching 2D art is a crime, especially when it's done so well.Technical IssuesAs of today, screen resolution selection and VSync have been fixed, so I don't have anything else to report at this time.So, should I play it?YES, you should. If you love action platformers, the metroidvania genre or just appreciate tightly designed games."
,Recommended,441280,34805119,Posted: 7 September,all,Yoj,"While the metroidvania genre as a whole is in no way devoid of games, it’s rare to find true gems among them. Games which aren’t just good in terms of graphics, level-design or story, but a great experience overall, like theShantaeseries,Axiom Vergeor the genre-defining series of Metroid and Castlevania themselves, are few and far between. This makes discovering Pharaoh Rebirth ever so better.All in all, Pharaoh Rebirth closely resembles the games from the Shantae series, which is good thing in my opinion, since those are great metroidvania games, which do many things right. From stylish old-school 2D graphics and great overall art style to an upbeat soundtrack that fits the game to the, from responsive and tight controls to balanced level design with just the right difficulty of platforming, the level of quality throughout all of Pharaoh Rebirth is surprisingly high.You play as a renowned treasure hunter Dr. Jonathan Banfieldcoincidentally he was turned into a rabbit, who is assisted by his hacker friend Jack. While trying to stop your ex-companion Andre Betancourtcoincidentally, turned into a turtlefrom pillaging a legendary ancient Egypt oasis, you uncover an unknown sarcophagus. Andre’s decision to open it results in you both being placed under pharaoh's curse to die in 7 days, so now both of you scramble to find the seven holy grails, which is the only way to save yourself from the curse. The story might not sound that interesting, but it fits the overall adventure atmosphere of the game just right. It is also greatly augmented by the game having charming and funny characters and quirky humor.Gameplay is top notch, with all of the genre-specific features present and being done right. The game itself is divided into several different locations, each of them represented as a separate interconnected Metroid-style map, which isn’t fully accessible to you right from the get go — some areas will be hidden off, while other will require having specific abilities to reach. When raiding each location, you’ll find all sorts of treasures, which either boost your stats or unlock new abilities for your character. So it’s always a good idea to go over the areas that you’ve already visited after receiving these new abilities, as there might be more treasures waiting. Overall there are over 80 treasures scattered throughout the game and over 10 sub-weaponswhich will greatly improve your experience, different items, power-ups and so on. There are plenty of cleverly designed enemies (like Cycads and Totem Poles that blend into environment, or even False Jonathans that mimic your own appearance) and some not too hard boss-fights; at least they won’t be hard when you’ve powered up or have a good strategy for each boss. But bossfights aren't the only highlight, there’s more: there are some on-rails platforming and turret sections to spice things up and break the flow of the game, an additional secret level (if you find all of the map pieces within the game) and a boss rush mode. The enemies also interact with the level in some cool and unexpected ways. For example, you see an exploding enemy. So what? Trigger and walk away. Now imagine the same enemy, but on the train. And the carriage you're standing on has just been decoupled. Pretty tense, huh?I can honestly say that going in, I didn’t expect Pharaoh Rebirth to be such a great game in its whole, which makes it even sadder, when you look at its sales numbers: SteamSpy estimates sales at around 10k copies sold, which is just asinine, no matter how you look. So, if you’re even slightly interested in such type of games, you should definitely give Pharaoh Rebirth a try.P.S. For more awesome hidden gems, follow the steamCRIMINALLY Low Salescurator."
,Recommended,441280,31401296,Posted: 27 April,all,Murikov,"This Metroidvania-style game was mainly programmed by a single Japanese guy calledKrobon, so hats off first. Before this he was responsible for several freeware and doujin games such asReturn Of Egypt, which serves as a quasi prequel toPharao Rebirth+.For this game Krobon was definitely inspired byCastlevania: Symphony of the Nightand similar games of the franchise. In other words you have the distinctive level design, the fancy combat mechanics (but rabbit ears instead of a whip), kinda like flying Medua heads, tons of items and upgradeable skills such as double jumps and suchlike.The pixel art is adorable and detailed, the music is catchy, there's lighthearted J-humour and the controls respond crisply. From a design and programming perspective there's not much to complain.It's also similar to theShantaegames, so you'll definitely like it if you already played these. But keep in mind thatPharao Rebirth+is nothing likeLa-Mulana, another J-game that looks pretty similar on the first glance. It's way less difficult and complex than that, has separate stages instead of a huge dungeon system and is much shorter on top of that. After a couple of hours you'll already see the ending flickering over your screen, so even unpracticed players will enjoy this platformer.All in all it's a very enjoyable experience, yet not a too demanding one. Try a higher difficulty if you feel unchallenged at first. Other than that it's chill.I'll give this therefore8 out of 10 rabbits."

Especially if you're a fan of the GBA Castlevania series. If anything, my only problem is that some of the jokes fall a bit flat but the writing for the most part is fine and the story is enjoyable and keeps things flowing."
,Recommended,441280,29157006,Posted: 9 January,all,luison.cpp,"A very good example of a hidden gemThis game has a total of 10 levels(the prologue, 7 regular levels, 1 extra level and a boss rush level), each level is like a mini-Metroidvania. It's is possible to return to previous levels to get some collectible items, or upgrades using new abilities.The gameplay itself reminds me a lot to Shantae and the Pirate's Curse.ProsVery good controlsCompelling art designGood musicGood level design with a good balance between action and explorationGood variety between weapons and moves maintain the gameplay fresh at any moment during the game.ConsEven when the story is relively simple, it has too much dialogues and they pop up too often. Fortunately it's possible to skip them, but still you can only skip one dialog at a time, not entire conversations, so you may end mashing the skip button.The only supported resolution is 640x480One of the levels is a very long mine car section, and it's as unfair as Donkey Kong Country mine car levels (and just remember, this game doesn't have wide screen support).Note 1: Some people complain that this game has tearing, to fix that just activate the vsyncNote 2: The default controls are a little weird, I recommend to configure the game before playing it, it can be configured in the launcher, but not inside the game."
76561198102808660,Recommended,441280,30514655,Posted: 14 March,all,Coonburgle,"This is a fantastic game. I honestly couldn't find anything to dislike about it.Felt like sort of a mix of Metroid & Mega Man. Good amount of content - 7 Stages, a prologue, and a boss rush mode. Always with at least one boss per stage. Boss fights are well balanced and never cheap, and have an arcade-style feel to them. The difficulty level felt just about right on ""hard"" setting, so I'd recommend starting there unless you're completely new to the genre - it's really not very hard, especially with collectibles, powerups, and save points littered all over the place. That setting makes it just difficult enough that you may want to learn the boss moves & think about your approach a bit.Similar to the old Metroid games, you'll pass some obvious barriers that require an ability you don't have yet, and will have to return later to explore new areas after gaining those abilities. The backtracking isn't bad and generally only takes a minute or two since you can stage select (and sometimes skip various portions of a stage). I think revisiting old stages is also optional for the most part, and not necessary to progress.Collectibles are done well and add to the experience rather than being a chore to hunt down - they generally add stats or a new ability, or are used in less obvious ways. They all have some flavor text too.Some people are hating on the car level, but I didn't find it to be overly jarring or out of place. It will just take a few tries to get through. If you're familiar with the old Donkey Kong Country games, its basically a mine cart level with lots of pits to fall in. And it does at least warn you of upcoming jumps and have several checkpoints mixed in.Biggest negative I experienced was some slowdown which required me to rework my nVidia settings a bit. For whatever reason, I had to manually enable v-sync and triple buffering in nVidia (and enable v-sync in game settings also) to make things run smoothly. However, I seem to be in the minority with this issue.Overall: Highly recommended. Totally worth my $10."

This game is fun to play, makes me laugh out loud, and has amazing music!I love how once you are able to see the dungeon maps you don't have to switch to a subscreen. The map is literally superimposed over the game screen and it doesn't distract you.  Just hit up twice and the map appears (once you have the tools to create maps). After a few seconds the map will fade from the screen.The characters and humor are great and I really want to help Jonathan lift the curse and regain his human form.  There's a ton of items and subweapons to collect and fun abilities to gain that will help you get to those hard to reach areas.  The bosses are cool and the dungeons aren't overwhelming, this is Metroidvania done right!I searched for somewhere to buy a soundtrack but couldn't find it anywhere.  Thankfully the music is available in .OGG format in the game's folders.Highly recommended for everything it has to offer. 10/10"
,Recommended,441280,32711711,Posted: 23 June,all,Mega Box & Bilco CDX,"This was  a surprise for me, I wasn't expecting this metroidvania to be particularly interesting when I bought it. That changed  when I played the first 5 minutes of the game. There was no ""warm up"" to get used to how pretentious some of these other indie metroidvania games can be. I'm leaving my review intentionally sparse because so many people have done an amazing job of detailing everything amazing about this game. Long story short, worth playing and replaying. In my mind, not quite cave story tier but certainly a hidden gem with some serious heart."
,Recommended,441280,24531798,"Posted: 25 July, 2016",all,Tim,"Quick and dirty: YOU can play this game; it's not nearly as hard as it seems. If you want a Metroidvania in an Order of Ecclesia style (focusing on shorter levels with tigther design over progression systems and exploration), this is it. It feels great to play. There's a lotta room for player expression with subweapon use. Weirdly engaging plot. But it's a bit of a hesitant recommendation. It's definitely worth the normal asking price, though. If you want it, get it whenever.Its controls are tight, but not corset-tight (particularly, 1) playing with a joystick causes some awkward hiccups; diagonals are interpreted as 2 keyboard keys; this causes issues with reading signs mid-jump or misalligning shots with a certain weapon, 2) the edges of platforms are almost TOO accurate to the architecture, yet your character's ""feet"" for determining collision with the ground are smaller than the sprite's).The Metroidvania progression feels reeeeally forced and hoakey. These aren't gimmicks that get you to look at levels in new lights; there are obvious barriers to progress to single, empty rooms with singular power up items. If you try to go back each time you get a progress power-up, you'll be disappointed. Only breaking boxes and double jumping give you new, fun challenges.The looser Metroidvania structure also hurts it as an action-platformer. It feels as if checkpoint placement wasn't considered in a non-linear fashion; this is most obvious in Stage 4, where the placement of enemies along slow, elevator-like grapple chains assumes a vertical or downward ascent based on an optimal level route that isn't clear until completion.The game can be suddenly punishing (mine cart level, ahoy!), especially with its long GAME OVER screen, but the lack of difficulty makes a game bursting with personality play like a vanilla wafer. There are many mechanics which are interesting but never required or dramatically helpful. You get a massive iinvincibility-frame dash, an aerial attack that pushes you back up slightly in the air, etc.--but there are no segments that force you to use the dash or platforming using this unique mechanic. If anything, their use trivializes much of the stage and boss design. You CAN finesse boss fights, but brute-forcing them is just as effective.A lot of the bosses have amazing, well thought-out, varied patterns that interact in surprising ways with your arsenal of subweapons... but you can easily just eat 1 carrot per bossfight (makes you invincible for 10+ seconds and ups your attack power), use your i-frame dash to cheese through their attacks that punish you for staying at close range once it wears off, and rush them down. The reward for succesfully figuring out good sub-weapons to use is often not the difference between survival and defeat, but seeing much less of a great boss than it feels you should.It's a game that's less than the sum of its parts. But, it's still neat as hell.The aesthetics are on point. The music has an emotional breadth while never failing to raise intrigue in cutscenes or keep you pumped up during levels. The sprites are GORGEOUS--please, play this in windowed mode if you can't get this to scale by whole numbers in fullscreen. Some of the use of paralax bakgrounds and varying visual styles among enemies and bakgrounds--it's this wonderful mash of strict depiction and heavy abstraction at once (just see the main character set up against beautiful, lineless backdrops of palm-trees and the ocean's horizon line).And there are some real feats of creative game design--particularly, check out how the machine gun interacts with chokepoints in the environment or how much enemy interaction changes once you consider the claymore in stage 4... but much of it is just an unchallenging, decompressed action platformer that saves its flair for boss fights and laaate game optional rooms, leaving a lot of unimpressive downtime.Oh, and the story?? Is excellent?? Reminds me of when movies took queues from movies but didn't try to be them--it has punchy little asides between action segments to progress the plot with laugh-out-loud dialogue. Unintrusive and compelling."

The game takes place in Egypt and features a wide variety of Egyptian locations, creatures, and folklore for you to encounter.This game is incredibly well polished for an indie title. The sprite-based graphics are fluid and full of little details, the soundtrack is catchy, and good snappy controls (save for a small exception). There’s loads of attention dedicated to minor things like how certain subweapons work underwater or in heavy winds or the number of cleverly hidden secrets and how to reveal them. The story is really good too and has a few surprises in store for the player as well as a bonus level if you find a certain item.Despite all the pros I mentioned earlier, this game does have its drawbacks. To start, it’s a bit short and the normal mode plays a bit more like easy mode. I highly recommend starting PR+ in hard difficulty to get the real experience and to try and get the secret level to really get your gameplay’s worth.  Also the mapping system is a bit annoying with how it comes up if you hit up twice and I accidentally triggered it a lot as a result.All in all, I had an overall positive experience with Pharaoh Rebirth+ even though I had to play it all over again due to a nasty bug (see below) but the game was so good I didn’t even mind. I highly recommend this title to any fan of metroidvanias.BEWARE: there is a game breaking bug in the 6th stage boss fight. To avoid it: stay near the left side of the area for the entire fight. You may also want to back up your save data file manually just in case."

,Recommended,441280,22807148,"Posted: 5 May, 2016",all,feitclub,"Pharaoh Rebirth+is a really cute Castlevania-lite game that's big on setpieces and dialogue rather than exploration. The lead character has great animation, can attack in multiple directions, and moves pretty fast. I found the amount of chatting between the characters was a bit much for me, but I did appreciate how distinct each character felt in the end. I'm not sure a game like this needs lots of banter but it made me laugh a few times and can be skipped if you don't want to bother.When I callPharaoh Rebirth+a ""Castlevania-lite"" I mean it's more likeOrder of EcclesiathanSymphony of the Night. The game occurs over a series of stages rather than one large level. You can replay stages as much as you like, re-fight bosses if you choose, and once you find an item it's yours forever. A lot of collectibles don't do much though, and many stages have dead-end hallways that make exploration less fun than it should be. There's also a ""driving"" stage which is basically a minecart level and a complete waste of time.However, the lead character is charming and fun to control. The boss battles are exciting. The story never pays off in interesting ways, but the characters have more personality than they normally do in games like this.Pharaoh Rebirth+is worth playing, though I can't say I enjoyed it enough to bother replaying it to findeverycollectible."

The screenshots and trailer didn't do much for me, but the gifs on the developer's Twitter page(https://twitter.com/krobon)got me interested. The 'behind the scenes' of the game looked so cool! So, based on the quality of those gifs, I bought the game...and I'm SO glad I did. 'Pharaoh Rebirth +' is an exceptionally well made game with a lot of heart. It's also SUPER fun to play. :)PROS---------------------------------------------------------------------- Likable and well-written characters. I was surprised how much I cared for the characters in this game. Everyone is just so likable and fleshed out. VERY cute and funny dialogue throughout.- Excellent gameplay. The game runs at a smooth 60 FPS and feels very responsive. LOTS of polish in gameplay overall. Very well done.- Fun abilities. This is a big one. This is a video game that is not afraid to have fun being a video game. (Following is a minor spoiler) One of the abilities allows you to change your ears into a paper airplane to glide across wide gaps. That right there should tell you everything you need to know. It's silly, it's funny, it's unconventional and it was ALWAYS very fun to play. :)- There's a metroidvania element, with abilities allowing you to access areas you couldn't previously. However, it has a level-based structure, instead of one big map. This is actually really cool, since it allowed you to just go back to the level where you remember an element was and explore more in that area.- GREAT music. It's so good. The soundtrack is on my computer right now. LOVE the music SO MUCH!!- When it was over, I got kinda bummed out since I wanted more to play. That (to me) is always a sign of a great game. I've put 12 hours into the game, beaten it - and still go back quite often to play levels. It's just FUN to play.- LOTS of abilities and collectibles. If you like to play with new, interesting abilities and find cool collectibles, you'll love this game. ^_^CONS---------------------------------------------------------------------- There are a couple times where the main gameplay is not platforming. Like, they'll have mini-games, puzzles, driving sections and things like that. While I understand that those sections were there to provide variety, they were also my least liked sections of this game. This game EXCELS in platforming, so I just wanted to spend more time doing that. It didn't feel good to get stuck on a section that gameplay-wise didn't have anything to do with the rest of the game. Thankfully, these moments were brief. Just thought I'd mention them here.- I hear that this game launched kinda rough in regards to vsync support and things like that. I think the devs have pretty much fixed all those issues. Again, just mentioning it.- The analog controls didn't seem to work 100% of the time for me. The devs patched in a deadzone option, but even with it at the max setting, my character still drifts to the left sometimes. Thus, I ended up playing it with the D-Pad (as opposed to the left analog stick) on a wired Xbox 360 controller. That solved the problem.OVERALL---------------------------------------------------------------------'Pharaoh Rebirth +' is a fantastic game with a lot of heart. Though there were initially a few technical hangups, the fun of the game overcame those shortcomings and I had a BLAST with this game. SO much fun. Very much looking forward to what the devs work on next! :)P.S. If you want to see another game that the devs have worked on, you can check out 'Action Mogura'. It's available for free online! :) A bit of warning, though: It's only in Japanese and MUCH more difficult than 'Pharaoh Rebirth +'. I beat it in a few days, though - so it's quite playable. Just letting you know. ^_^FINAL SCORE---------------------------------------------------------------------9 out of 10"

The stages offer a good amount of variety, the bosses are for the most part simple but still fun to fight.The soundtrack is really nice.The story isn't really deep or anything and the humor seems a bit forced at times, it's still enjoyable though.The controls work but they could be a little more refined. Jumping sometimes doesn't feel as responsive as it should be and there really is no reason not to use more buttons than are used.You only get a single save slot which for this kind of game and in this day and age is not justifiable.What I really dislike about this game is the ""car stage"" (actually the first part of a stage) which you can't skip on revisits and which you have to do to get some of the collectibles. It's really annoying and doesn't fit in with the rest of the game.Other than that, the game is good and I very much recommend giving it a try!One more thing, the amount of challenge you'll get out of this depends on the difficulty setting you choose and how much you beef up yourself by getting all the different collectibles. For someone having experience with this kind of game, playing on hard definitely is recommended. You can only choose difficulty when starting a new game, so keep that in mind."

Gets quite difficult in some segments, but rarely unfairly so. Currently have had no bugs or any trouble detecting my 360 controller (haven't tried D-input controllers), only downside for me would be the lack of higher resolution options, otherwise it still looks really charming."

,Not Recommended,441280,34855073,Posted: 10 September,all,Insanitys Muse,"I don't know why people are calling this a Metroidvania, it isn't. It's closer to a weird Mega Man / Donkey Kong Country hybrid, but less fun than that sounds.The controls are not clean and don't feel great, strike one in a primarily platforming game with instant-kill spikes everywhere.There's a lot of issues with actually making the game run smoothly for a lot of people, I managed to get it going after several restarts and trying different options out after 10 or so minutes.The upgrades are OK and typical enough for a Metroidvania but the level design, gameplay, world selection, etc. all speak to it being more of a typical platformer, with Metroid style movement upgrades which largely amount to unlocking 1 secret in a past level and letting you progress in the current one.There's no excuse for the car level. It's just objectively bad and again, reflective of a platformer game design in the middle of something that just isn't quite in one place or the other. I don't know how air horns blasting at you every 5 seconds (sometimes faster) as you retry over and over got through any kind of ""fun"" test. I had to mute the game to get through that section.If you've played Axiom Verge, Hollow Knight, Ghost 1.0, Shadow Complex, all the Donkey Kong Country games, all the 2D Super Mario games, actual Metroid games, Castlevania: Symphony of the Knight, Mega Man collection, and a few others I'm forgetting right now and you still want more, then OK, this might scratch some of that itch, or at least make you eager to go back to one of the good ones. Otherwise, skip it, even on sale. I would refund it halfway through if I could."

Pharaoh Rebirth has some fantastic spritework, great animations, and some great and catchy music.  I was actually quite surprised by the fun selection of subweapons in the game too, they're pretty diverse and aren't really like your standard Castlevania subweapons. The developers of this game very clearly liked Order of Ecclesia as you can see some clear callbacks and inspiration, for example instead of being a standard Metroidvania that takes place in one huge map the game actually has seperate levels to choose from that each has their own map.Hell I'm surprised a game this good is priced at $10, I'd gladly shell out $20 or more for games of this quality.The only real downside I'd say about this game is that personally towards the last half of the game the bosses take a dip in difficulty, especially if you were exploring properly and find a number of attack/defense boosting relics."

Now the game looks great and I've changed my review to a recommend.This game seems very well-made and fun so far. I would love to be able to recommend it to people. Unfortunately, there are two things that are currently preventing me from doing that.1) There is only one resolution option: 640*480. That's it. Not really sure what that's about. They should have given us two or three different options at the very least. One seems pretty ridiculous. Especially one that small.2) There is no apparent way to enable v-sync. The resolution problem I could actually live with. No v-sync? That's a deal-breaker. All that horrible screen tearing makes this lovingly-crafted, beautiful game look nothing short of atrocious.I'm hoping the developer can resolve these issues with a future update. Just like the screen is when I try to play this game, I myself am torn. I want to recommend it. But until they give us v-sync (and maybe some other resolution options), I just can't."

I noticed that on Youtube playthroughs pretty much nobody else has that problem.My single complaint was the jagged tearing of the background while moving. I still view it as a postive experience.
