(for the old skool SW fans, you'll see some unique artwork.)People who want fast paced, walk away.People who think their Jedi are going to be a super weapon, walk away.People who want to get their revenge on a bunch of tiny bears, who should never have been able to overpower a fully armed and operational imperial army... Walk... well actually you won't get to see the little fuzzballs, but if you work really hard you can blow up the the planet they orbit, which I'm reasonably certain will take their moon with it's furry little bas... I'm getting sidetracked.The strategy side is great, playing as the rebels at the beginning, you really are on the backfoot. The Imperials have stronger ships, better troops, juicier core planets. (Hint: Rebels - fighters are you friend, nay your salvation).Tactical side is old and outdated, tbh it wasnt very good back in the day either. I rarely play it, letting the auto-decider do its thing. This can be a little handicapping as the auto just adds up numbers for who wins, which if you're Rebels puts you at a serious disadvantage. Much like the Total War series, there is fleet combat you could win by playing it instead of auto. Or maybe lessen your losses ( for example facing a fleet with an interdictor, if you play you can focus fire on it blow it try to get some of your ships out. Auto you just die).Play the from the end of episode IV - A New hope, the way you want to. Fulfil the rebellions goal of toppeling the Empire just like the movies. Or conversly take command of the Empire, and embarass those pillars of the Imperial academy by not being thwarted by a bunch of pint sized care b.... I'm getting side tracked again.While I really do love this game, I feel for it as well. It has it's faults, which sadly if it was made today would probably be solved by steamworkshop access, this won't happen though with how old it is.- Tactical combat as mentioned above - Graphically boring, and they clearly had ideas with it that never really got utilised (you can move your ships vertically, but there's no tactical benefit for example), Tactical combat effectively is just biggest ships or group of ships focus fire on single target, rinse repeat and hope you do that before they do.- Characters/Agents - Characters supremely useful to wnning the game, and could effectively level up. Agents, very little value and couldn't level up. I think with some tweaks on how these types of units were created and level'd (i.e. making it more obvious how they level'd and maybe introducing some form of training mission/facility0 up they could be even more fun to play than they already are. Also actually show what difference having Characters in command positions actually did.- Ground combat - non-existant, just click invade and hope your troops numbers are bigger than the other guys.The strategy part of the game though *shrugs* I'd barely change anything about it, I think it stands up to many modern offerings.And because someone somewhere will be thinking it. Empire at War is not a remake of this game, I remember it being announced and grinning ear to ear thinking finally Rebellion 2 is here!!EaW has better tactical combatEaW has ground combat, though I didn't really like the groundcombat it offersEaW Strategy side is utter tripe in comparison to rebellion"
,Recommended,441550,21594096,"Posted: 2 March, 2016",all,Grand Historian,"Star Wars: Rebellion is a classic grand strategy game that's almost as old as I am, and it shows. A word of warning; many of the negative reviews here (rightfully) deal with issues regarding graphics and loading the game, which can be resolved with a bit of tweaking.I played this game to death as a kid, even though a lot of my success in it was the result of endless hours of trial and error; the learning curve is perhaps the steepest in video game history, there's no tutorial, and everything that's thrown at you can be overwhelming even for people who are familiar with grand strategy titles (a PDF scan of the old instruction booklet can be found in the folders, though). Likewise, while the graphics might have been cutting-edge in 1998, they're... lackluster nowadays.But don't let either of those disuade you; Rebellion is one of the greatest strategy games ever made, and could easily give most games nowadays a run for their money. You can play as either the Rebellion or Empire with the ultimate goal of defeating the other faction and liberating/dominating the (size adjustable) galaxy.At your disposal to accomplish this monumental and occasionally grindy goal will be a near-endless array of space ships that you can command in glorius 32-bit space combat (the spiritual successor to this game; Empire at War, would refine this aspect greatly), dozens of characters from the period ranging from everyone between Luke Skywalker to Thrawn, agents who you can send on missions to subvert the enemy or strengthen yourself, and as many armies, shield generators and Death Stars as your infastructure and technology can support. And as everything takes place in real time, you will rarely find youself without something to do if you play proactively - and the AI won't sit back on its laurels, either.In addition to everything else this game has to offer in terms of gameplay and replayability, the game also comes complete with an encyclopedia that gives a treasure trove of information about all the units, ships, planets and characters that appear in game, all drawn from the across the entire extended universe lore available at the time. So if you also want to explore the old Star Wars EU, or just dislike Disney's, this is also the game for you.You can also train Chewbacca as a Jedi if the game smiles on you, so there's that.Rebellion is well worth the $6 and initial headache, and can be immensly fun, immersive and addicting if you have the patience to learn its ins and outs, and I highly recommend it for any fan of Star Wars or grand strategy."

It is one of my favorite Star Wars titles.That being said, avoid this version. On my Windows 10 PC at least, it is buggy as hell. Playing the game Full Screen washes out the colors and flips all the icons upside down. Playing the game in a Window fixes that problem but now you have a 640x480 unscalable window to play the game in... When the game starts it is impossible to skip the droids 20 minute speech without deleting the .dll files for them. Also, perhaps most importantly, the drop down menus for the constructon buildings doesn't seem to work. I click the drop down and nothing happens. So for me, the game isn't even playable.I will stick to my Windows 98 VM and SWR disk when I want to play this I guess...Steam shouldn't allow broken titles like this to be sold here.UPDATE: I was able to figure out how to get the drop down menus to work... you have to play with the game in a little window in the top left corner of the screen. But then I ""discovered"" a new ""feature"" of this game. It crashes randomly... and SWR doesn't exactly have an autosave."

It can get a little tedious with micro-management, but what other game allows the player to take the role as either the Rebel Alliance or Empire in a virtual sand-box galaxy where you can choose whatever you want to do?The game is a little dated graphics-wise, but it's otherwise really brought to life with the original voices of the original cast, the expanded universe references and the ships.Even though I already have the CD to this, I bought it on Steam both for the ability to just download and play, but also because I wanted to make sure I could play it on my Windows 7 machine.Overall, a great game for a very good price."

It places you in charge of either the Empire or Rebellion and gives you open ended freedom after that point.It is a very dated game that will not stand up graphically to modern day titles. It makes up for that with a strategic depth that has not been seen in many titles since.If you're a hardcore fan of either Star Wars or strategy games I recommend adding this to your collection. If you aren't either of those you can still give it a try.

It can be opaque, the battle screen is almost useless, and the UI can be a disaster.But I still feel like this is one of the best Star Wars games out there by giving the player the ability to shape the universe how they see fit and create their own stories - and have fun while doing it.Plus, it lets you play as the Empire without having to inevitably join the Rebellion.

The port does have a few problems, so listen up for what to do to play this game without the upside down icons, graphical glitches, or the infamous production selection not working.Right click on Rebellion, go to Properties, and then set launch options to '-w' (this will open the game in windowed mode, thus fixing the upside down icons). Launch the game, and leave it in the top left corner and do NOT move it (moving it causing the production glitch bug). Should look normal, but the client is in the upper left corner.After this, game plays as I remember it! I still recommend this title because that may not really be an issue for some people, and other than that the game is still fun."
76561198011965365,Recommended,441550,31650175,Posted: 9 May,all,Saint Aaron,"Absolutely fantastic real-time 4x game, in a category all of its own. This game looses you onto the Galaxy as either Empire or Rebellion in the post Battle of Yavin era (after Episode IV: A New Hope), awarding you full control over well known characters, as well as a slew of expanded universe ones. You will gently direct your faction from your command deck, watching events unfold and little stories being created. That is one of the things that made me fall in love with this game: it sometimes feels like an RPG and it most often feels like a sandbox.There is a certain apparent simplicity to the game that belies underlying, emergent depth in how your characters develop and how the galaxy changes shape around your actions. Do not be fooled by the dated graphics (the space combat sequences are especially clunky to control), it somehow manages to convey a very authentic original Star Wars feel and your imagination is going to take off and over in the middle of all the little non-animated X-Wing sprites as they swarm an enemy Star Destroyer.Did i mention you can build a Death Star and blow up planets?The game, however, will not hold your hand and you are bound to discover all sorts of relatively hidden gameplay elements (Your force users, for instance, can sense force potential in other characters and train them. Sending Jedi Knight Han Solo with a force sensitive Chewbacca as backup and decoy to sabotage an enemy ISD never gets old). Occasionally the UI contributes to the confusion, but nothing that should stop you from enjoying this awesome piece of game.I sincerely encourage you to give this one a try, if it hasn't already consumed hundreds of hours of your childhood. You are bound to discover one of the best Star Wars games released and an excellent 4x. If only Empire at War was this + updated graphics, it would have been perfect."
76561198096079278,Recommended,441550,22804706,"Posted: 4 May, 2016",all,FriendFive,"This game is so classic. I played this a lot eighteen years ago when I had the original CD-ROM with the hefty, well written manual (anybody remember the cool reference poster?). I am so glad that it is available on Steam and I am so glad that the problems that other reviewers reported earlier with upside down icons have apparently been resolved. This game works perfectly (well, I have had two crashes in 16 hours of gameplay, but saving regularly is quick and easy) and I got it for just a few bucks. I am also glad the game comes with a PDF of the original manual, but I wish it was a higher quality scan. Oh well!I am having so much fun playing it again after all of these years and it's just as good. They only thing I will say negative about the game is that it has a really terrible interface. There are menus, sub-menus, scrollable lists, and tabs galore. There's lots of scrolling and hunting around for things, as well as lots of clicking to initiate things you want to do in the game; sending Han Solo and Chewbacca on an abduction mission, aided by a team of rebel infiltrators, to capture Darth Vader on Sullust, for example. The depth of this game and all of the many things you can do can really make it hard to keep track of all that you've got going on around the galaxy. At least the game provides a search tool that lets you find specific planets, personnel, or fleets pretty quickly.Seriously, if you love Star Wars and strategy on a grand scale, you owe it to yourself to try this oldie-but-goodie. I can't wait to try out playing against someone head-to-head, something I never did way back when."

,Recommended,441550,22276025,"Posted: 6 April, 2016",all,Aureia,"TL;DR: If you like Star Wars and strategy games and are willing to look past its age, buy this game.Star Wars: Rebellion is an older title, but still one of the best in its class. No other Star Wars game has the level of depth and strategy as this. You have all the forces of the Empire or the Rebellion at your command, and it's up to you to lead them to victory. As its leader, it behooves you to strengthen your faction's military, industrial base, political support, and information networks in order to keep the war machine at full capacity. Few other games will make you feel like a master strategist as Star Wars: Rebellion.Pros:+ Broad-scale strategic gameplay that ranges across the entire galaxy+ Deep mechanics for building, managing, and conquering your faction+ Control famous characters like Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Darth Vader, and Emperor Palpatine+ Command space battles with iconic Star Wars ships like Star Destroyers, TIE Fighters, X-Wings, and even Death Stars+ A who's-who look into the Expanded Universe pre-Prequel Trilogy ; almost every unit, hero, planet, and building comes  from the EUCons:- UI is a bit outdated - it's a very menu-based game with little in the way of keyboard shortcuts or other modern concessions- Some of the mechanics aren't explained well in-game, meaning you will have to consult resources outside the game to understand how everything works- Tactical depth of battles are lower than you might expect - space conflicts play out a bit slowly with a strange UI, while land battles happen completely behind the scenes without player input after the battle begins- Little optimization for modern hardware - you may need to do some work to get it to run on your machine. Running the game in compatibility mode helps a lot"

The best you can do is try to out manuever the enemy at the beginning of the game, for example I once defeated a Victory Destroyer with a Corellian Corvette and  Bulk Cruiser by constantly getting behind it (where the Victory Destroyer has no guns).  It was a long fight, but injuring a large ship like that can be worth it at the beginning of the game.  That being said, eventually ship to ship combat is just lining up and shooting til you win.The rest of the game play is solid, as long as the interface doesn't bother you.  There are a lot of windows to open and close.I really wish they would remake this game with a graphical upgrade and make the ship combat more interesting."

,Recommended,441550,29679012,Posted: 3 February,all,Zanthra,"This review is based on an old CD ROM version I had.Years ago I nearly lost a friend due to this game. He parked his imperial armada over my fortified rebel planet, and proceeded to lose a star destroyer in an attempt to bombard it. When he decided to maintain the blockade afterwards, I sent commandos onto the fleet to blow up some of his ships. He ragequit, and I am lucky I still have him as a friend.This is a very nonstandard strategy game. The game is very much tied in with the story and lore of Star Wars. As important as the resources you collect, or the ships you build, are the characters you have and send on missions. Diplomacy, Intrigue, and Sabotage all come into play. If you don't have enough ground troops on a planet who's loyalty is swayed by the other side, you could lose it and all the resources it provides.It is also great fun for anyone who is familiar with the Star Wars Expanded Universe, as many references to characters, ships, and species are included. The Empire get Noghri Assassin squads, and the Rebels get Bothan Spies. The empire get characters such as Thrawn and Dalla alongside classic characters like Piett, while the rebels get some characters that may have been of questionable loyalty in the books, like Talon Karrde or Borsk Fey'lya.

Master of orion is probably a better game but it didnt have to stick to core material like rebellion. Mast of orion is more complicated and diverse. As in you can build your own race, ship and diverse tech trees. Rebellion is much more cut and dry but thats not a bad thing. If you like master of orion or other galactic conquest games where you manage many planets, ship, troops and buildings and star wars you will like it.Pro:Play as empire or rebelionBoth sides have the same buildings and basic ground/space units. All advanced units are fairly differant.In effect turn basedMostly space combat. There is only a handful of ground units. Sorry no AT-STMany several dozens of heros you can recruit. None effect ground commbat. Space commanders, spies/assassins and diplomats.Get the emperior + vador or mon mothma + luke.Each side has real strenghts and weaknesses.Like some galaxtic conquest games after you have a few dozen systems it become tiering to manage. Luckily you have a whole list of things you can at any time have the computer take over. Say you have all the main planets you want you only want it to build more mining, or ships or ground troops ect and it will take care of it.Very good information system on events.Good layout of the game buttonsWhole libarary of info about lore or game info or what units do.Whole list of things you can do with heroes and special forces units. Such as diplomacy, inciting riots, stopping riots, sabatogues, assassinations, abductions, training in the force (only vador and look can train others), recruit more heroes, recon and more.Win situations in several ways. There is direct combat and special features as i listed. If you cant get past a planets defenses you could sab it with enough time and take them out that way then defeat them with a much smaller fighting force.Travel time is reasonable. You could travel to the next cluster of stars in a few weeks of game time. Which is not that long considering most buildings and large ships take much longer to bulid at first.You can speed up building by having more of said buildingYou research upgraded buildings, new ships and new ground units.Con:Not much replay value each of several set ups are all the sameGame is pretty long and can drag on for a very long time if you decide to colonize all planetsSome features you are not told you can do, you MUST explore and right click to see if there is an option that comes up.Game of cat and mouse with empire chasing rebellion. As such can be fun or aganizing.On units the stats are partially hidden till you buy 1 and look at their stats. Can be miss leading.There are 3 kinds of ground units. Heroes, combatants and special forces. Special foces dont actually attack in combat. Its very misleading at first.For the first few hours I hope you like having many save files for when you make mistakes."

I've probably clocked more hours on this game (even before it came out on Steam) than any other game I've owned. Back when it was released in the 90s this game was possible a key factor in my doing less than amazingly in school.The update/port to Windows 10 works plays just as it did back when. The graphics are dated, the space combat limited, but damn it I still enjoy it now.Why is this a 'no' then?The game crashes. A lot. It crashes roughly once every 2-3 hours for me. That may not sound like a lot, but this is a game without auto-save. A lot can happen in 2-3 hours, and a lot that you basically need to redo. Every time the game crashes I feel like giving up because unlike starting a game afresh, it's incredibly boring to execute the same strategies to take the same planets to have the same outcomes again. It's one thing not knowing what's going to happen. It's completely another having to relive the same 300 days all over again.So... great game. But what a frustrating port.I'm not sure if I'm going to play this again. Was it worth the few dollars I paid? For the nostalgia, sure. But has it possibly ruined the memory of this game forever?

It has become a point of pride that the homeworld of those nasty, furry little c**k smokers must be wiped out as soon as possible - b*llocks to the diplomatic consequences, the Flea-woks must die.On a slightly more serious note, the units are quite well balanced, the Death Star may seem powerful, but they are expensive and take an age to build, the rest of the ship classes are pretty comparable, with the Empire having a slightly edge in military capability. Where the Rebels excell is in diplomacy, when combined on missions to convert neutral worlds, Alliance diplomats are extremely proficient and can expand your resource potential very quickly in the early stages of the game.To putit simply, the Alliance definately has the edge in the early stages of the game, with the Empires' strengths coming to the fore in the latter stages of the game.I could drone on for ever aboot the best tactics to emply, but the beauty of this game is it gives you the freedom to try many different things, you can even have Luke Skywalker assassinated - so much fun  :)The interface is a little clunky now, but once you get used to it, it's pretty simple, if a little crude by todays standards.tbh, the space battles are sh*te, but can't really be skipped as the simulated result doobry can't be relied upon to give u the best results, even if the odds are in you favour.In summary:Totally free strategy + nerd-fest levels of technical accuracy + having Chewbacca whacked + Death Stars + destroying Endor = very much woth the cost of a couple of pints of beer."

It punishes you if you're not constantly using all of the resources available to you (especially is you crank up the difficulty)  and rewards your patient and persistent efforts to crimple your opponent. And all of that's before we add in the fact that's it's StarWars, and who doesn't want to build up a giant fleet of starships and have and epic space battle against the empire?

Back in the day, I played a lot of strategy games, and I did pretty well at most of them. I was in the top 50 at StarCraft in the late 90s, top 5 at Red Alert 2, #1 at Empire at War, and I took the top 10 spots in other games. Needless to say, I'm a strategy gaming fanatic. I was even interviewed by GameSpy at one point. Yet, this is the game I ALWAYS go back to playing, even after so many years. I prefer this game over StarCraft and other games. It is THAT GOOD. The multiplayer is absolutely phenomenal and incredibly addictive. Every game is unique and different. You get different starting conditions each time and you really have to be smart about how you use your personnel, facilities, and ships. There are so many strategies and counter strategies.In multiplayer, the game is played at variable speeds, it automatically adjusts to the slowest player. If one of the players selects the medium pace, and the other player selects the fast pace, the game is played at the medium pace. You can change the speed of the game while you play, so you're not locked in at one particular speed for the entire game.Multiplayer is where this game shines. It has the best multiplayer out of any other strategy game I've ever played. It's so incredibly interesting, especially once you understand the mechanics of the game and how everything works. If you've never played this game before, or if it has been a while, definitely get this game. Then, get online and start playing some multiplayer games.

Control the Rebellion or the Empire and micromanage everything!!! (if not you can tell C-3PO to do it for you).Pros:- Very indepth game, one example is this game has a political system, once you invade a planet and take it over, if that planet is not allied with you politically the system will riot- Vast amount of Ships, fighters, characters, troops and buildings, Example Star Wars Empire at War a great game also is not nearly in-depth as this game- Varder or Luke have the power to sense future jedi and can train them to use the force, very cool- Huge galaxy, if you choose the large galaxy there are i believe over 100+ planets and each has its own history or descriptionCons:-This game is old, from the late 80's or 90's i think, so example when you enter in a space battle the graphics suck pixel ships shooting red and green lazers at each other- Also since this game is old not a big community on how to plays and mods unlike Empire at War, there is a website deticated to updates and mods for this game but its long been dead-Dont know if this really is a con but this game can be long, especially if you choose the large galaxy, which can days or even weeks to finish a gameSo i give this game 8/10 its a great buy for the Price, if your a fan of Empire at war or similar in depth Star Wars games this is a MUST BUY!"

Basically, this game is a comprehensive Star Wars universe game that range from space battles to diplomatic missions. But I wouldn't say it is for everyone, as the gameplay can be seen as quite tedious for a video game standard - you deal with static images and pop up notifications most of the time. I see this as a strategy game comparable to chess, where the visuals matter less than the information on the board and the options you need to think about. There is a 3D space battle mode, but this hasn't aged well. Controls are clumsy and graphics are very limited (fighters are sprites, and capital ships have a very primitive geometry). Again, this is for those who care less about graphics and interaction and more on how to make strategy decisions in a Star Wars universe."

I can easily recommend this game as a strategy lover. Moreover, to the fans on Star Wars and its ""expanded universe"" (which is re-written due to the latest trilogy) it would be a nice addition. I lacks stuff like Eclipse Star Destroyer and land battles but I don't think they are huge losses.What is more important in this game is the resource management and agent management which has a surprisingly steep learning curve. (some forum  research is recommended) It does not have the complexity of the Paradox Games or the Tactical options of the Total War series or the faction selection of Civilization V but it still can hold its own using the 4X formula.Recommended for lovers of Star Wars, Strategy games, oldies but goldies and 4X games. Not recommended for gamers who don't like some of these aspects."

Sins and EAW are obviously completely different animals, but let's look under the hood:On one hand, Rebellion's mechanics, and more open-ended interpretation of what was then 21 years of Star Wars canon can convince players they're actually in overall command of the Alliance or the Empire. Every game starts mere days after the Battle of Yavin, and deep, non-linear gameplay lets you rewrite Star Wars history from there; you're building shipyards, factories, defenses, mines and refineries to supply your war effort; you're assigning beloved characters to command fleets, planetary garrisons, or on missions of diplomacy, sabotage, abduction or rescue. The randomized starting conditions of each game are the sprinkles on top.On the other hand, Rebellion has a crappy UI, and is noticeably poorly balanced (some planetary bombardments, and rescue or sabotage missions often end up annoyingly ineffective humanitarian disasters). Don't expect comfort from your optional control of the needlessly emphasised space battles - they apparently have separate mechanics altogether, comperable to Masters Of Orion for all the wrong reasons.Get Rebellion for its gravely overlooked place in the history of early Star Wars games, for its depth, and for its tiny, but damn persistant following; DON'T get it for its undercooked interface and design flaws."

Loved it when you could play it on a PC, back in the days of windows 98. Still a great game, plays as it did years ago. It was never followed up with a remake, this with a graphical upgrade would be a great strategy game to compete with anything out now. If you love star wars than this is a game worth playing, set with the background music from the movies. It's a builder type game so it's slow to start until you have saved up what you need to build your rebellion or empire."

,Recommended,441550,33760241,Posted: 24 July,all,TheSicilian,"Easily one of the best classic mid-1990's era strategy games from the Star Wars/ Lucasarts team, I re-purchased this one during the summer sale.  It's like real-time RISK but with a Star Wars theme, and the full-scale 3D Space Battles are a key feature, even if they're ugly by modern gaming standards.  I do not regret re-purchasing this at all, it quickly became one of my top games for playtime on Steam (I more than doubled my time-spent on a single exhaustive pass through KotOR, for example, by playing 3 times through Rebellion).  It lived up to all the nostalgia I would expect from any childhood favorite, reborn.This game plays like a long-running board game but with more variables, and the 1v1 multiplayer (which I used to tie up phone lines to play on 56K modems) works exactly the same as if you play by yourself, except you'll trade the Computer opponent for a Human."

Graphics are showing their age but the gameplay more than makes up for it.Sadly the Steam version has some odd new bugs (as well as the few original ones) & is prone to the occasional CTD and even total system freeze, even for me on Win 7 where there's supposed to be no problems. Kind of understandable given the age of the game but still, I feel like more could be done to bring it up to compatibility.For £5 I'm not complaining though. The original boxed version cost me something like £40 back in the day & I've never regretted buying it! Having a copy again is worth a few quid to me.My advice however would be to give the Steam version a miss, get yourself an old Windows '98 or XP machine and find a boxed CD copy on Ebay. Voila! No compatibility issues, fewer bugs, audo that plays properly and possibly THE nicest paper manual ever printed for a computer game!I whole-heartedly recommend the game... just not the Steam version of it."

So just make sure you save often, it sucks to start a game and get a few hundred turns in a hour or so, and then it crashes and you have to start all over.Other than that, it's still one of the only Star Wars titles which lets you build and use the death star on any system you choose. 10/10 would terrorize galaxy again."
