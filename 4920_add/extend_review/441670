It's a pixel-art puzzle platformer based on strict action sequences with a tightly cropped screen area, so the player can't see much - all the difficulties come from these 2 facts, making you to navigate levels with try & fail method, gradually studying its structure. But after you have once passed an area there is just no intrigue left to return.Besides the objects themselves being presented on screen up close, their hitboxes are extremely large as well, so you can stand on 1 edge pixel & can be killed by the last pixel of a projectile - it feels clunky. For example a machine gun kills you when you stand against its butt, because that's where the projectile starts.So if you are not irritated easily & you do like this genre it may find a way to your heart, yet for me it stays visually appealing but rather shallow memorization puzzle, suited for mobile devices (where you can get it for free btw)."

Bought it for the bagdes, then went to actually play it for 100% cheevo's... it's actually very fun!  Reminds me of old platformers like Commander Keen of Mega Man.  While there were quite a few game freezes at random times, they didn't happen too terribly often, and the game made up for that with the stages all being really small so you never lose much progress (you can restart at the beginning of whatever level you have unlocked/gotten to).  I've only played easy mode all the way through, and maybe I'm not as good as I once was, but even easy mode could be a challenge at times!  Not a ""zomg, I want to throw my keyboard into a wall"" challenge, just a ""omg, I need to take this game more seriously"" challenge.  Pretty short, too, I got through easy mode in a few hours (not counting sleep time).So, pros are: 1. Trading Cards, Trading Cards, Trading Cards!2. Can actually 100% the cheevo's3. Short and challenging levels4. Fun, retro style5. cheap price (especially with a coupon!)and cons:    1. minorly annoying game freezes every now and then (counterbalanced by short levels, so little game time is actually lost)All in all, I rlly like this game and highly recommend it!"

,Not Recommended,441670,33820677,Posted: 26 July,all,YellowLab,"This game was not what I was expecting. It is a puzzle platform game where you can ""zombify"" other humans to use their abilities. For the most part, these humans are located in a static location and don't do anything. The soldier will shoot you, but the others just stand there.Jelly Killer is needlessly frustrating. There are two issues that make it so. First, the camera is limiting. You cannot see what is around the corner until you get there. Second, there are lasers and other deathly traps that trigger randomly. There is no pattern. So, you may know a laser is there, can't see it and have to make a move based on luck. Bad design decision.Cannot recommend this game."

The only problems I have are the camera and control layout for a keyboard; you can't shift the camera, which can obstruct your view and not see what is ahead, causing to get hit by something you couldn't see coming in the first place.The layout for the keyboard controls is fairly awkward. Allocating the fire button to ""Alt,"" when it could've been put to either ""Q"" or ""Space,"" coupled with no way to edit the control layout, is a design choice I don't entirely understand.Other than that, the game plays and controls very smoothly and has an artstyle that seems reminiscent of Scott Pilgrim vs The World, which is pretty cool."

,Recommended,441670,30304821,Posted: 3 March,all,Love💋,"Alright, Jelly Killer. A game where i don't exactly know if the Translator made a lil hickup or if it's intentional (Spoiler: You actually play the Jelly and kill people, not the other way around)Either way, i got this game back then for i think only a handfull of cents with a Coupon i got from making badges. I actually had to look up to regular price for the game to make sure what to expect and rate it better. I will disclosure that in the end of my review.Note: The Game description describes the game extremely well and puts every feature nicely and shortly into detail anyway, so i won't go on to long over key features.Jelly Killer is a very sweet short Puzzle Plattformer for cheap money. Basically you are a little Jelly Blob Bioweapon trying to escape the Facility. You go through Areas, short little levels. Goal: Get from Point A to Point B, which are recognizeable as tubes.On your way to get to your goal you must jump yourself through the area but also avoid Traps, such as Turrets or Lasers on the wall throughout the level. Your little Jellys main ability is controlling the bodies  of humans though. There are 5 different Human types all throughout the game, some show up in an area, some don't. These humans all have different abilities, the scientist can jump higher then the rest, the worker can push boxes, etc. . Your goal is to figure out which way to go, when to possess them and how to get to your goal. For example, a box blocks the way to the exit, so you need the worker, but he is on a ledge you cant reach, so you need  the Scientists higher jump to give you a boost. But watch out, once you get hit by one of the Obstacles, the body you possess dies, means if you did a mistake, you have to restart the Area. Thankfully, you can restart anytime you want in the menu, and the Areas are so short it never gets really frustrating.This concept of possessing the characters isn't really groundbreaking by any means, but it's fairly nicely done here and fun to play through. Some could wish there was more variations and more people to possess, but the game is so short it's not really a problem. Overall, what the game tries to do with it's gameplay is well made.Also, another cool thing i really liked: Some Areas let you act differently and use shortcuts or give you easier routes to reach your goal. Allthough i must say, i wasn't completely sure if that was an unintentional oversight by the dev or on purpose to make Speedrun strats for example. Either way, i welcome it alot!The graphics for that price look suprisingly pretty well, considering it's price and simply concept. The animations are cute and look nice aswell. Game runs with constant 30 fps per second and looks perfectly fine.Now for the things i disliked about the game, those are only small criticisms though.Allthough soundeffects in the game are alright, i wish a way better music would have been chosen. Not even 4 areas in i decided to put on my own playlist to play through. The song playing is a.... rather weak Midi song that loops throughout the game. It's not really spectacular and rather boring to listen to.My second problem could only affect me, but i had at times bit of input problems (i used the PS4 Controller to play this game). At times, Jelly didn't jump right way or not at all or didn't self destruct the human body when i needed him to, missing a few jumps or getting the timing wrong. This made some areas a bit frustrating to play through unfortunately.Some people would also put the short lenght as a legitimate criticism point, but i think this game is alright with it's price and lenght.  The game can be finished in 1-2 hours depending on your skill (the game isn't too difficult to begin with), so take it as you will. I for myself didn't thought i wasted my time or my money, it was a fun experience.After finishing the game i also tried hard mode for a few Areas. It's basically the same exact thing as Normal mode, but with landmines scattered around the areas to make you watch your little step a bit. Doesn't turn the difficulty to much up though.Overall, i had fun with it. Would i recommend it for 3 Bucks..? Tough question, but i would go with a Yes. The game is charming for what it is and if you need something quick to play it certainly isn't a bad choice either."

Hazards just outside the field of view will have you taking leaps of faith on spikes and getting shot in the head by turrets you can't see yet. If it is by design you should be aware of it. I would have liked to know that before buying it as I don't like memorization. If it's not by design, however, it's not too hard to fix. This being pixel art, simply changing the field of view is not exactly a walk in the park, but it would be one way of solving the problem. Another is to program the turrets to not shoot when outside the view and find a way to signal when a fall means death. And occasionally redesigning when nothing else helps. Again, assuming it's not by design.Edit: it might be useful for the developer that I played with an xbox controller. Just in case the issues I encountered have something to do with that."

The different humans abilities make up the puzzle portion of the game, with five types: Scientists, who can jump high (because nerds are well known for their athletic ability), Engineers, who can move boxes, Soldiers who can shoot, Jetpack guys, who can double jump, and finally Generals, who can open doors. Be sure to posses them in the right order, because they die when you leave their bodies.This game has 54 areas. Now 54 levels may sound like a lot, but I completed this game in under 2 hours on easy mode and under 2.5 hours on hard mode.Obstacles such as guns, lasers and crushers seem to have random timing. Which can make avoiding them more of an excersise in luck than skill. And the game designers have no problems placing some of these obstacles outside of your viewable area, even with the ability to scroll the view up and down. So you'll probably need a few goes on the later levels dying stupid unfair deaths, until you've located and remembered all the traps. Hard mode will have you cursing the level design quite a bit.On the plus side it's very well presented, with a pleasing scanlines effect on the graphics.Overall I'd have to give this game a 6.9 out of 10. I had a little bit of fun with it, but a lot of frustration. I can't really recommend it."

The frustrating portion of the game was trying to get the right timing of avoiding traps, which were not well synchronize. The game has three difficulty levels(easy, normal and hard). I'm not sure if the map layout changes with each difficulty but from playing only a few levels in hard mode they add mines to the game to create more of a complex atomsphere. The game has about 54 levels and possibly more on hard mode.If your a big fan of the genre then you will enjoy this game."

,Not Recommended,441670,30991582,Posted: 6 April,all,WildSyde,"Let me be clear, I'm not downvoting this because it's a bad game, the first couple levels are wildly fun and interesting and add a bunch of new mechanics to the platforming genre... but however, the one problem with jelly killer is that it get's old real quick. After the first 10 or so levels, you seen everything the game has to offer, and the remaining 42 levels are just rehashing the same old stuff you've seen in every other level. It's also infuriatingly difficult, but not in the good way. No, this difficulty doesn't stem from the puzzles being quite difficult to figure out the solution to, quite the opposite, the puzzles are fairly easy to solve. The reason that they're difficult is that most of the time they just rely on sheer random chance. The various guns in the game don't seem to have any sembelance of a pattern in which they shoot, so it could be 5 seconds between shots or it could be 1/2 a second. Sometimes it just won't pick up your keystrokes, leading to several annoying deaths when your character just walks into a pit of spikes instead of jumping.So overall, a brilliant idea, but executed in a very boring and generic way."

,Not Recommended,441670,30332861,Posted: 5 March,all,SpookerHellington [YT],"Disclaimer:This is my own opinion, I'm not trying to be mean here. Whether you're a fan or even the dev team try not to get to mad, or sad over 'lil old me. Just voicing what I think. Feel free to politely disagree.Overview:What isJelly Killer? A pixelated nightmare of 2D platforming, that's what. I'll admit, it's a good concept, but like many things when put into action it just does not work. The controls are hard to nail down, several areas are way harder than they should be, the puzzle aspect is fairy undermined by the soldiers or whoever they are, and frankly I'm not even sure if this is supposed to be a puzzle game.Gameplay:It's in some awkward place in between puzzle and combat, and it just doesn't feel right. You can't fight by yourself, you've just gotta dodge and jump arounduntil you can nab one of the soldiers. And in that case the theme seems to shift far more to combat.Aesthetics:I'm not one to complain about things like graphics and art style often, infact I quite like pixelated things. However, I suppose I'll have to make an exception here, because I do not like the art here one bit. Whilst it gets points for good pixel art(far better than my own I'll add), it just all seems so bland. The color scheme is just off, a bit too brownish. Doesn't add for a good feel at all. On top of that, there's black outlines onEVERYTHING. Don't get me wrong, putting these on your art serves very well in practice, but when put into the final product, just looks unprofessional and choppy. And lastly, the art and environment doesn't make all that much sense considering the backstory. It doesn't really scream ""Science Lab"" like it should. Looks more like a renovated cave or dungeon. The spikes are also a bit weird, not something you'd find in a science lab. I'd expect something more like tesla coils or lazers.Playability:Whilst normally alright in playability,Jelly Killerstill has its problems. Take the controls for example, I may be a special little snowflake here but I've had a very bad time trying to figure them out. But let's not forget the two other errors I've found, loading time and difficulty. The longish loading times may be just something to do with my machine or Wi-Fi, though I doubt it asJelly Killerwould be the only thing to have this effect, so you shouldn't really take this one to hardly. Diffuculty however, is another story. You're lucky there's no real cheats for this game, because I would definitly have used them. The reason why is due to the unbalancedness of it all. Some areas are severely diffucult, where you just have to do the same thing over and over until you finally succeed, and others where you just can't figure out the solution. Then there are areas which run smoothly and easily, no real in between making for a very choppy and annoying experience.Scoring:Gameplay - 2/5Aesthetics - 1/5Playability - 2/5Overall - 2/5"
