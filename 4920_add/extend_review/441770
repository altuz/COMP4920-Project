I also used the beta for MindTex 2 a lot (hence only 15 minutes of time at this point). I can still recommend this software to anyone in need to create quick high quality normal, height, specular, reflection, gloss, self-illumination or occlusion maps. It generates these from a simple diffuse texture (preferably an albedo map for the best results).The biggest + however is its price which is incredibly low, especially compared to other pieces of software that essentially do the same.Definitely recommended!"

I highly recommend this software, especially because it's only $14.99. Which is a complete steal when compared to other similar softwares like CrazyBump which costs $100."

All i have to say is: Wow, this is simple, powerful and extremely intuitive.Pros:- Generates all types of maps out of one diffuse texture- Generates Normal Maps- Generates Height Maps- Generates Specual Maps- Generates Gloss Maps- Generates Self Illumination Maps- Generates Reflection Maps- Generates Ambient Occlusion Maps- Has a Batch-Workflow to generate multiple diffuses to mentioned maps in one pipeline- The price is rediculously low for what this Software offers.Cons:- Really, i couldn't find any.I highly recommend this Software to both, beginners and advanced people."

,Recommended,441770,21954463,"Posted: 20 March, 2016",all,Marcurios,"This program is decent, i say decent cause it makes good normal maps and there is a reasonable amount of control to influence the normal maps, though i would like a bit more control over them. Specular and gloss maps are nice too and height maps are very good, also enough control to shape the height maps.However, diffuse maps are totally destroyed if you compare them to the original diffuse, it is obvious due to the use of a bad codec to save the jpg file. The diffuse that gets saved is grainy and aliased and just looks bad, luckily i mostly make the secondary maps out of a perfect diffuse map, so i always have my source diffuse map, so there is no problem with the diffuse being saved bad for me.I'd say it's not yet a professional package, although it might be considered semi-pro, it does it's job pretty well, still there is room for improvement.Overall i like it and it's easy to work with, everything can be tweaked with a visual 3d representation, although i did not notice any change in the real time view when i tweaked the gloss maps.I'd give it a 7 out of 10, but it sure has potential to grow into something great."

Not perfect on it's seamless generation but all in all nothing in this price range out there and certainly this is amazing that I recieved this for free because I bought the first version years ago.-quickly generation thick and beefy normals-pbr texture flow ready although technically no metallic/ roughness but gloss, metal, opacity, you figure it out, it's there-if you already have seamless textures you will enjoy this program for it's ability to maximize your end material,"

Gaffney,"Although it has some annoying limitations, it's seriously invaluable to me at this point, and at this price it's hard to recommend any thing else.  I'm sure some of the really high-end softwares are worth it but if you don't want to take that risk or you just can't afford it, I have very little to complain about here.It fixes seams with reasonable efficiency, has loads of colour options for each map, allows you to paste images from the clipboard, supports multiple images to blend at once, generates very good maps, is fast, offers many shape layers on height and normal maps, often knows what to do with lighting in a photograph, and is just overall good and cheap.My complaints?  Two:  only square textures are supported, so I have to paste my non-tiling textures into Photoshop and 'square' them with a border before using them in this software; and when you blend maps with other images you have, you can't completely control the way it blends and you have to keep the original map as your 'main' map.  Annoying, but worth the good it comes with."

,Not Recommended,441770,26414875,"Posted: 4 November, 2016",all,Deygus,"This used to be a really handy multi-texture map generator tool for stuff like normal, ao, spec, etc that was very fast and helpful especially for game development stuff.However, in it's current state after several tries and several workarounds I have found that recently it is not working on Windows 10 on my end though others claim it works so perhaps it is different for some people it seems.At this point I personally cannot recommend it until the problem is fully resolved and I do not recommend buying it at least until I know and can verify it's working 100% again.It has forced me to use Mindtex 1 which is okay but not as good nor as finetuned and also leaving me looking for other affordable or free alternatives for the time being which is extremely upsetting.As the saying goes you get what you pay for..I have since moved to ShaderMap which I like a lot better, it can do way more even though it is double the price but well worth the switch."
,Recommended,441770,25771307,"Posted: 29 September, 2016",all,digimortal81,huge improvement over the original which was a mess.  a neat feature is the blending of layers which lets you get variation and seamless texture creation super quick.   to get best results you will still need good texture input and add a macro texture for variation in UNity ir Unreal but this software is damn easy and super quick.  I made two materials for UE4 in about twenty minutes thats including improting the textures and setting up material in engine.  B2M3 is better with more controls but for speed/price this is a great tool to get started with for texturing.
