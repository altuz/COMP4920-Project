,Not Recommended,441870,21399922,"Posted: 22 February, 2016",all,Det. Dicksmack²,"Is this a joke? The description of the game is longer the actual game.All you do is seriously drive around one track for as long as you can without any obstacles other than the occasional roadblock with a ramp and a gunship that spawns every 8 minutes getting in the way. That's it. That's the whole game. The bullets don't even do anything! They're not even a threat! All they do is make the road randomly spawn debris in your face which comes with no warning. There's no other hazards... just hard turns, roadblocks and a gunship. Pitiful.The only good thing this game has going for it is a nice aesthetic and some pretty good music. $3 for literally 8 minutes of gameplay... 13 if you actually can make one full lap without falling asleep. Literally get the ♥♥♥♥ out.Perhaps I'm being harsh on, say, a college student's final project for school but this isn't something you charge people for. Nitronic Rush was a final project for school and that had more content and was released free. This is a 99 cent mobile game AT BEST. Also, don't copy Powerdrive 2000. You're not Powerdrive 2000. And you're not going to ride off it's kickstarter success.If you want a game with more in-depth gameplay and content check out Distance (the same team who made Nitronic Rush).UPDATE 2/26: DENVER has recently updated the game's description to say this game was created just for the sake of music in order to save face. Yes, the music is decent, but don't be fooled, the game is stil garbage. Do not fall for it."
,Not Recommended,441870,21435184,"Posted: 24 February, 2016",all,The Rumor Weed,"OutDrive, in one way, is an amazing achievement, and DENVER has a lot to be proud of with their creation. I mean that. The screenshots simply do not do this game any level of justice, as there's actually a lot of varied scenary to keep things fresh and thus never feels like the ""empty sunset highway"" some people have voiced concern over before buying. The combination of audio/visual elements delivers THE best 80's/neon/VHS/vaporwave experience I've ever seen in a video game, hands down.There is so much attention put into everything, from the tastefully low polygon count on most of the assets, to the bloom that glows softly off of the neon and the post-processing filter across the screen, it all ensures that this game feels like a 3D interactive vaporwave poster art. As a work of art, it's meticulously crafted and feels SO good to play for the first few minutes.Alas, the art style is not the aforementioned achievement displayed in this product, because it's just ripping off of the upcoming Kickstarter-funded game Power Drive 2000. Seriously, look up some screenshots and try not to feel insulted on behalf of PD2k's developers. Even if you're someone who's really into the whole vaporwave/vhs aesthetic, this game is not worth the price of admission as it's just a petty clone/cashgrab feeding itself off of the Power Drive hype. I want to make it clear that I do not hate this game for not being Power Drive, because I had no idea what Power Drive was until after I  played this game and read some of the user reviews. I have zero attachment to that project, and my opinion is not in comparison to that game, but how the game stands on its own merit in a world where it was actually an original idea.The problem with OutDrive is that, beyond stimulating your eyes and ears, there is NOTHING left. At its most basic level, the game mechanics are actually quite good, which makes it even more confusing that nothing interesting was done with them. Driting around sharper turns is fun, hitting the ramp between roadblocks is fun, balancing speed with trying not to overheat keeps you engaged as you drive. And yet, absolutely none of these things provide you with any real challenge. My FIRST run in the game lasted 28 minutes and the only reason I stopped was because I was BORED, not because I failed. Despite having a meter that forces you to go fast but not too fast, I spun out, came to a COMPLETE halt, hit the (unlimited) boost, and was back on my way without penalty. It's borderline insulting.There are so many great ideas here that just don't do anything meaningful. If you're driving through a city (which looks ♥♥♥♥ing SICK, by the way) you may have to dodge cross-traffic or some of the lanes may have a car driving alongside you. It would have been so easy to use this as an opportunity to challenge the players environmental awareness as they have to watch the road ahead of them, and dodge the cars beside them, and yet these other cars are separated by wide distance, predictable, and easily avoided. Likewise, there is a helicopter that shows up once in a while to fire bullets at you, which literally just bounce off your car when you do get hit, there is no consequence for this whatsoever. Sometimes, the chopper will try missiles instead, which hit the road ahead of you, bringing up chunks of pavement that you may crash into if you're not careful. While these missiles are the hardest part of the game, they are by no means a threat, considering even if you get hit by a big slab of the road and find yourself turned 180 degrees, all you have to do is quickly press that boost, turn around, and you're on your way before your speed meter ever reaches the bottom.If you want to jam out to some downtempo 80's-esque electronic synth music while dining on a visual feast, go for it, but do not expect the game to challenge you in any way. It's an endless runner that somehow screwed up the most necessary part of the genre: losing. And that's one hell of an achievement to be proud of."
,Not Recommended,441870,24108844,"Posted: 5 July, 2016",all,GeeTee,"The developer goes out of their way to explain that it's ""not a game, but an aesthetic concept"". Ok, I get that. OutDrive hits a lot of marks - compelling artstyle, pretty great music and it runs well to boot, but in the end it actually is a game in the sense that you need to control a car and keep it between a number limiting factors, namely the road edges and the upper and lower speed limits. Sadly, this part just isn't fun. Devs, if you want me to hear (and potentially buy) your music and you choose to package it in the form of a game, then you'll need to make the game component compelling as well, especially since I'm forced to actively play the game in order to hear the music."

His girlfriend is shot and you hook her up to your Delorean and you have to maintain a certain speed to keep her alive.Drive too slow she dies, drive too fast she dies.The neon visuals and overall the entire design is fantastic, but sadly that's where the good ends and the bad begins.The game is endless and there's no ending what so ever, and to experience everything the map has takes you at least 15 minutes and after that there's nothing else. There are obstacles in the road like road blocks and ramps. There are also random encounters like traffic and a helicopter which shoots at you, but it does absolutely nothing and after a few shots the helicopter explodes.The entire game gets tiring after a few minutes and after that there's nothing to do.The soundtrack is great and is really fun to drive around to listen to the music, but it's not worth to play the game just to listen to the music.I wanted to like this game, I really did, but I can't, my honest recommendation is to wait until Powerdrive 2000 comes out this coming May,Final Rating:3/10 - Don't BotherIf you liked this review please consider giving this game a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked.For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator pagehere- follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!"

It will however accept a button on the secondary for the only Brake function on the Control configuration launcher area. BUT NO AXIS FOR BRAKING.X-Box 360 controller needs to be configured before you play. EVERY TIME YOU PLAY.There are no options in-game whatsoever.

NONE.Game does not tell you how to play, as simple as it is, you should at least know what you should do or not do, I kept getting game over after a few seconds even though the car was already quite fast, it was only when I tried to use the keyboard left shift button that I noticed that the key function was bugged on the controller function.I don't mind unfinished games, I rarely finish most of my games anyway, what I do not like under any circumstance are non-functional games. That's what this is for me. I simply can not play it, regardless of how cheap it is, it should at least work.I was looking forward to playing this, and simply writing a review that says ""This is what you would get if Kung Fury, TopGear and Distance had a Baby!"". The soundtrack alone is fantastic. The concept is really cool too. Hopefully they will add more functionality to the game, some in-game menus (not very hard to do), and just make it playable.

The controls make no sense, WASD for movement, L.Shift for Boost, and Space for brake. Everything is too focused on one hand and makes the buttons feel weird. Arrow keys should be movement but only adjust the camera.There is also little to do, and is essentially an Endless Runner against yourself; there are no leaderboard that I saw, not the the menu is very fleshed out, and there is no other game mode.I'm sure if it was given more time, there would be more to this, but right now, I found it to be not worth my money."

The Gameplay looks pretty good, the music is amazing, and the graphics are pretty nice to look at. When I purchased the game and played it for a little... I soon found out why. Now don't get me wrong, the game is pretty cool and fun to play, however there are absolutely no options for the game. no raising or lowering the sound, no changing controls, not even any other game mode options. All you do is pretty much drive. Your goal is to get a high score which I feel shouldn't be it main focus, especially if you're trying to keep a girl alive! Speaking about her, I feel like she's not even there, sure the meter tells us how she’s doing but other than that we get no dialogue from her or the driver, we don't even get to see what they look like in game. Now I've seen some people encounter a lot of glitches, however I didn't have this problem to an extreme. My game glitched out only once and it was for crashing into an oncoming car. I also feel a like there is a lack of action, only a little bit though. There are cars that come after you and a Helicopter that guns you down, but those are in very small sections, after you pass the sections they're gone. Then it's a dead, lonely, empty road. At least have a few cop cars chase for a bit in those sections, really make it like I'm the game, that there is a purpose, to make me feel hype.  I feel like this game should have some kind of story behind it, I mean how you like a movie where the person just drives to keep this girl alive, no ending. At least stay focused on the story and makes the high score part a secondary game mode. Do I recommend the game? No, not unless there do some serious updating, if you're interested buy it on sale."

But somehow when you get the control everything will be fine.Maybe too fine... Once you mastered the controls, the game become extremely easy. Road is empty, you'll have to face an helicopter shooting at you maybe every 5 minutes.And about the track, 50% of the time you just driving on an empty road, with no traffic and empty surroundings. It gets boring pretty quickly, and I'm pretty sure the map is not generated. During my 20 playtime, I came across the same city, with the same crossroads at least 10 times.About the gameplay, the game expect you to drive not too slow to keep your ""girlfriend"" alive but also NOT TOO FAST.... DO NOT GO TOO FAST ! in a driving game ?!?! Excuse me ? So you've got to juggle with your tubo, toggling it off and on every 10 seconds. Which make the camera pan, zoom in, zoom out, every time... It gets really nauseous.Is this game a sequel to outrun ?Not at all, the crossroad are there but feel empty. I don't feel like accomplishing something when I survive past a crossroad. The background does not change, there is not a map at the end of the run showing off my progress, just a plain timer. Everyhing I'm doing feels empty, and serve no purpose.So in conclusion, in its current game, OutDrive could be the core of a good driving game. But it really needs more polish on the controls, the gameplay, the backgrounds, and need more gamemode.I really wish the dev will update this game, so I can change my review to a positive one.PS : Also beware the game being made on Unity Personal Edition, it is not really well optimized. I barely hit 30 FPS (specs :Intel Core i7-4700MQ + GeForce GT 740M + 12 GB DDR3)PPS : After some research, it looks like dev are just trying to cash in and do a clone of PowerDrive 2000 .... Gonna do some more research but will probably ask for a refund if it turns out to be true.PPS : Quote from developers""It is not a game.Only music concept.Mimimum mechanics - maximum music""So yeah, probably won't be fixed/updated.

But I have to admit that I'm quite disappointed.As it stands the game doesn't deliver a reason to be played.As other reviews already said - it totally lacks in content und optimization.

Even if it would be like in Trackmania with 3 different positions to choose from.Audio sliders for not only the music, but also the car noises and SFX would be awesome.The game definitely needs graphic options.

Please give us an options menu with ways to enable and disable all the different visual effects used. This is literally the first game I've played that game me a headache just because of the visuals.And a menu with a tracklist where you can listen/preview the tracks and disable/enable them for the game. Maybe even add support for own music or spotify/soundcloud. maybe give us an adjustable RNG - like how many events (roadblocks etc.) occur and such.It's just ""Hey, you can drive as long as you want - or can. Look at the street (or the blue bar beneath the car) and enjoy the music (if it suits your taste).""Reasons for playing could include achievements, multiple play modes, maybe even a small storymode. driving through different parts of the country with levels getting harder. and a happy ending where you are actually able to save the girl.just quick ideas for another play mode: relaxation mode, where the girl can't die and you just drive and boost the way you want.The game could also get Steam Workshop support. Player-made mods would be awesome.

Getting a high score in OutDrive is the equivilent of one of those radio contests to see how long you can keep your hand on a car... but by yourself.

,Not Recommended,441870,32870243,Posted: 27 June,all,Sir.Hyrrämyyrä[Noobie♥Doobie],"So, the idea behind the game seems interesting, however the execution is very VERY lackluster.First of all, the controls feel extremely unresponsive, and personally I've had my drives end on the fact that the car does NOT turn when I am doing nothing else but try to turn, the control rebinding is executed on standard Unity splashscreen, that results tehre being unsorted control namings that does NOT represent the terms used in game, the tutorial assumes you will use the default controls (because of course) and you can not bind acceleration ald/or boost to X-input trigger, because such keys are ""buttons"" and therefore ""may not be bound to axis"". The default keys for keyboard are WASD, when no mouse is used, thus making the logical choise the cursor keys (for right handed people).But that's just the controls, what about the options? Well, all the options you are going to have is on that standard Unity splash screen that apparently does NOT remember the resolution you previously played with, so it needs to be set EVERY SINGLE TIME you start the game (that goes for the ""quality"" too, btw). And since the strongpoint of this game is the music, one would expect you to have volume controls? NO! No option to add or reduce any volume but to do so in the system mixer. Very intuitive, ain't it?And what of the gameplay? Well, you will tap the boost button hoping that the car turns when you tell it to, on a flat surface with very rare ocasion of a ramp on your way. No variation in the speed adjustment, which should be the core of the game, considering the theme, and that is good, since ""accelerating"" does nothing, and you basically play the game with the ""boost""Bottom line, this game is basically a very bad advertisement for a good music that you can luckily buy outside of the game. I'd refund this but the amount I bought it was so trivial that I'll keep this to have a look IF there is some attempt to redeem the game. Even so, I feel I overpaid."

Unfortunately the game beyond a generic time counter and some drifting / jump-hitting there isn't much purpose, unfortunately there is an overheat meter that limits you from just flooring it constantly (ala Excite Bike, or something of the like...) which tends to both emit a somewhat annoying noise when you accelerate, and also limit how much you can just be barreling along listening to the tunes.All that aside, for the price and considering it's a bit of a what you see is what you get kind of game, what is presented is well-made."

The game is simple, as are the mechanics, but they are very effectively employed. You really just keep driving for the music. So if you're looking for a way to vegetate a little bit while listening to pretty awesome synthwave-type music, this is for you. If you vehementaly demand any sort of complexity or depth of experience in every game you play, however, then I would strongly suggest you look elsewhere."

,Recommended,441870,32736426,Posted: 24 June,all,Declirious,"To truly get the experience of the game we need to take it wayyyy back the the groovy 80’sA simpler time, full of dank music, dank colors, and the best (most cheesy) action moviesOutdrive is currently only 50 cents, you could either buy a condom or this, so what do you get for that little money?The game starts with a very retro cinematic, it shows you that yo grill gets shot, and to keep her alive you connect her to the speedometer of you car. You have to maintain speed to keep her alive.Go to slow, and her heart's stops, go to fast and her heart overloads.The game is a endless runner, but unlike most you have full control over your character (in the style of a racing game), most games would have you move between columns. Not here, here you have full controll.The controls are simple, W for gas, S for reverse, Space for Drift, and Shift for turbo. One thing I really like about this is that you can use turbo for however long you want, there is no limit. But while using turbo the car is harder to turn. It adds a nice level of depth to a otherwise brainless game.Every once and awhile you will come across giant helicopters that try to kill you. This is nice because without it the game is kinda easy.But it might be a good thing, this is not a game that needs a lot of strategy. It’s the kind of game that makes you melt into your chair and forget about all of your problems.One reason for that is it’s amazing soundtrack, it’s very retro and basey, using synths and other “Vaperwave” sounds. Something also amazing about it is that it’s all made by individual creators that have these songs in real albums. Buy the soundtrack on steam, it’s pretty fantastic.One cool thing about the game is that the tempo of the music is directly tied to your speed, so the faster you go the more tense the song gets.Moving through the amazing landscapes while listening to the music will leave you in a almost trance like stateThis game is also really visually pleasing, It’s a eyegasm that will leave your spectacles sticky.It’s using a very retro wave graphical style, it’s like a mix of gta vice city and tron.So if you have a little bit of leftover money sitting in your steam wallet, you should give this a try. You won’t be disappointed."

Runs very slowly on low-end computers.Crashes and freezes a lot.Kind of hides the meter at the back of your car, it seems pretty useless and it doesnt really tell you how to play at all.The popups for the overheating and slowing down lastWAYtoo long.

At first it's kinda funny because it reminds you of when VHS tapes(if you're old enough to remember them) would lose tracking and make the audio slur for a moment. The novelty of this wears of very quickly when wanting to just listen to the music, though.The controls are somewhat slippery and while they're not that hard to pick up, there seems to be no real option for recovery whenever you make a hard crash. There's no way to reverse the car and once you've crashed into something like a wall of cars in front of you it makes you pretty much S.O.L. Your only option is to just restart the level.It's priced normally at $3 but isn't even worth that much.The best thing I walked away with was the new set of tunes I'll be jamming to in the near future. Ironically enough I feel like this was the REAL purpose of this game. Not to make a decent little quickie you could pick up but more so to expose these retro synth artists(none of which I've even heard of until now funny enough) and get music sales going.How am I so sure? It's a part of the main menu, lol.You want a good 80' style racing game? Sorry. It ain't here.Hopefully that will be Power Drive 2000(the game this one clearly ripped off).You want some good 80's style retro synth tunes? Here you go.These are all the links they provided in the game to buy the music from each artist. These are at least worth it if you're into the genre like I am and definitely worth the money more than this game.https://future80s.bandcamp.com/album/around-every-corner-digital-deluxehttps://soundcloud.com/logic-puzzlehttps://nammusic2.bandcamp.com/releaseshttps://3force.bandcamp.com/releaseshttps://d-noise.bandcamp.com/releaseshttps://soundcloud.com/quasarshttps://wingsofsolace.bandcamp.com/https://spaceinvaderspaceinvader.bandcamp.com/https://retouch.bandcamp.com/https://priusansich.bandcamp.com/You're welcome."

However after about an hour of gameplay I found that it lacked any type of true difficulty and sound design outside of the music. Its a great game to just sit and relax and play but I was really hoping for an arcade style game with obstacles and difficult racing. I feel that with some polish and added difficulty, as well as perhaps some variety in the cars, maps, this game could be an awesome addition to the libraries of fans of 80s style such as myself. I even liked the endless idea of it, but it just kind of loses its interest after the initial gameplay. I feel that an increase in difficlty and some polish to the launcher and gamepad controls would help this game a great deal. I wish luck to the developer on this project if he continues to support it. However if you're looking for something with all these dope 80s themes, along with difficulty and racing I can't recommend it in its current state."

I kept slowing down just to watch a section of terrain roll past, and the opening cinematic had a great 80s-noire feel to it. I half expected the car to ask me if I was a bad enough dude to save the girlfriend.+The music is phenomenal, though I wish you could control it at all.CONS-There is literally nothing to do in this game but drive. The only obstacles are turns and jumps, and because of how terrible the controls and handling are these obstacles will usually end the game.-The car handles like a brick on crisco. While holding forward it shimmies left and right for no reason, even on straightaways. While drifting (the only other control in the game) the tires' friction spikes and drops randomly, meaning you need to mash left and right to avoid slamming into a wall.- Touching a wall at all is like running headfirst into a tree. There's no grinding around a curve, you just get slammed to a stop and, usually, turned around. At one point my car flipped on its side, and the game decided that was my new road. I was only able to drive straight up into the air until the meter dropped and the game ended.- There's no validation on the randomly-generated road. A jump can spawn that fires you directly into the wall, at which point you get to choose whether you hit the barricade and lose or take the jump and lose.SUMMARYThe game is, unfortunately, not fun. It looks and sounds awesome, but the gameplay designer seriously dropped the ball here. I understand it wasn't meant to be a game, just an ""aesthetic concept"", but the bugs and shoddy controls ruin the experience completely.PS: After 8minthere's a couple more obstacles: a helicopter and a city street. The heli shoots at you (which does nothing) and fires rockets that spin you around and throw chunks of debris onto the street. Neither is too bad, but if a chunk of debris lands on you while you're spun out you can't turn around in time to avoid losing. Heli spawns every 8min. City street materializes cars in front of you that act like walls.Still not really worth the time."

Overheating the car does nothing gameplay wise but put on an ugly aesthetic ruining filter (you cannot lose by overheating). The whole aesthetic of vaporwave is a 1980's world with syns and capitalism with a city them, the issue being that you spent around ten seconds in a city once every five minutes with an occasional tv shaped billboard, to improve this you should add more time in the city and really work on its design and add more fake advertising. an option to lower music volume or turn it off completely would be nice as some of the soundtrack is not for everyone and i usually mute my game with my music in the backround.For the person reading this who is not a dev:If you are bying this game i would really reccomend it, it is very calming and relaxing with your own music but is a bit buggy. -ENTRION"

And all obsticals are roughly the same; drifts, ramps, and the occasional helicopter attack, this game has potential, but the entire goal of the game currently is to get a high score, I know this is a small arcade style indie game, but I feel it sould be developed a little more, little things, such as dialouge, more assets and obsticals, and perhaps some challenges or collectables to give you more of a feeling of purpose. Perhaps a race mode against NPCs, or an endless mode where you drive, without the girl.As it is now, I say it is a 6/10, this is because of the nice style, and soundtrack, the content is rather underdeveloped"

Keeping up with the speed you're supposed to drive at isn't tough but it is awfully distracting when you bump into walls and the soundtrack slows down.The best part about this game is the audio, and to punish the player by pulling them out of the amazing soundtrack they were listening to only because they drifted incorrectly is a terrible mechanic. If they can rework that single problem, I wouldn't mind holding my WASD/space keys down for an hour on this neon lit road towards the neon sun. OutDrive doesn't have controller support  yet, and the game's resolution is a bit hard to get right. I hope that the developers intend to fix this soon because I would love to play this game often.Although I didn't live through the 80's, it definitely has that vibe, and if you enjoyed Hotline Miami, you'll enjoy this game. OutDrive has a lot of potential, and it's a must buy for the current price. The soundtrack itself is worth much more than that, and so are the aesthetics.

I'm recommending it simply because the developer did put  time in creating this game. He used his skills to get the word out about some new song artists that are trying to make it in this world. However, there's a lot of room for improvement.This game seems to be more about the music rather than the actual controls or gameplay.The pros:-Colorful, and alive background-Good music-Good concept/story-Cool, easy to use UI-Easy to pick up/redirect yourself if you get stuck (usually)-I do like the concept of when your car stops or crashes, the screen dims (her life is ending if you don't get yer sh#t together man!) and the music slows down. The music will also speed up when your car is overheating.-The ""life"" meter is simple to follow, but has room for improvement.The cons:-The car (controls) does not handle so well at times. (Sometimes if you hit the wall, your car will spin all the way around, but a pro is that you can easily redirect it) It feels like you're skating on ice.-Hard to see road blocks (You may not have enough time to react to it)-Having to redo your settings each time you start up the game (gamers usually like their setup to be remembered)The developer himself mentions above that this isn't technically a game, but more so a music/aesthetic experiement. I do believe that this ""game"" has a potential to actually be a game though. If the developer focuses on fixing it or tuning it, I will definitely play more of it in the future. As I said, the concept is very cool. I also believe the game would be better if we didn't have to worry so much about hitting the walls. You run into them quite frequently. (Or maybe I'm just that clumsy?) But I suppose it's better than falling off the track every 30 seconds.Now if you're looking for an inexpensive way to listen to music and enjoy some neon scenery, here you go.Note: You DO see the helicopter in the game (I found it about 7-8 minutes into my ride, but it isn't too threatening)."

Although that being said, it should be noted that everything inside it can become repetitive. As a quote-on-quote fan of the synthwave style of music, I do like the setting of the game as a wholeSoundtrackAs I mentioned earlier, I do like the synthwave genre of music with songs such as ""Decay"" by HOME and their other song ""Resonance"" I do find however, that the soundtrack is a bit repetitive and sounds god awful when it slows down (More on that later) I also find that (In my opinion) that the music is to fast to be classed as synthwave, but I suppose that it's due to the fact that it's a driving game. I do wish they had implemented music from HOME and others into the game, but again, that's my opinionGame MechanicsEh... They are not the best in the world, I don't know if it's because its coded in Unity (A personal displeasure to me and doesn't say as far as I know on the store page), if it's because it's a driving game, or if I am terrible at driving games. The idea of this game is to keep your girlfriend(I assume?) alive by driving your car, you also have to keep the icon in the blue area (Or the safe zone or whatever) or it can go into the red zones by either; over heating, or going to slow, to stop this, you have to either slow down, or speed up. That is essentially what you have to do, also, did I mention that you can also make the icon go into the low red by hitting something, no? Me neither! as far as I know, it doesn't mention that anywhere at all and I didn't know that, until I lost the game because of that, bare in mind, that the physics of the game itself and the driving mechanics are VERY wonky, and don't really work with a keyboard and would be best played with something like an Xbox controller or a Steam Machine or Steam Link, then again it might just be me. To me also, it's counter intuative to have it so that the icon goes into the low red when you hit a wall when the mechanics are god awful, well that's in my opinion.Conclusion/OverallOverall, I don't personally recommend this game, it's not suited for PC, but would be better as some sort of indie game on console's, but overall, I like the style, not so much the game its self. But don't let my opinon deter you from this game. Oh and also, while you're reading this review, you might want to get this game on sale, for it's low price at the start, I wouldn't say it's worth it (I got it for 49 pence, bet you can tell where I come from now ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°))If I had to give it a score out of 10, maybe something along the lines of a 4-5/10"

I get it, you're selling more of an experience rather than a game, but it's a frustrating one.Any adjustments to screen resolution, graphics quality, or key mapping must be done outside of the game itself in a launcher. I'm playing with a controller, and changing the button mapping in particular results in a significant delay. The in-game menus are also incredibly laggy.When you get into the game itself, you're monitoring engine temperature vs speed to the point that you just might be distracted from the rest of the controls just not being able to handle some of the sudden very tight turns you're expected to make. It's not fun, and it's more annoying than anything else. (Seriously, the line of cars at the ramp, which I think was designed to add some level of challenge to this, was just annoying instead of an actual challenge--with these controls, getting past it is more a matter of luck over skill.)There's potential here, but it's hidden underneath irritating controls and laggy menus."

This game is based on how long you can keep from wiping out. Its not a matter of how long you will last or more like when you wipe out. It has the Synthwave soundtrack and the astetics to follow. Straight forward controlls and makes a causal arcade like game. Instead of collection points it about your longest endrance run. It does have a mior downside it's a large game to be built with Unity.

I got it at a generously discounted price and I'm not complaining, but I would not buy it for it's 3 EUR price tag - and here's why:- I get it that this is ""not a game, but an aesthetic concept"" (a detail that I have to admit paid absolutely no attention to when I bought it), but it has an objective - drive as long a possible - and it would've been a good game if it had rewards at certain milestones or some more variation, changing scenery, or even as little as a scoreboard to compete against.- The physics is a little weird. Sometimes you won't lose your speed to a head-on collision with the invisible wall at the two sides of the road, sometimes barely scraping the wall stops you completely.- To make it worse, the game sometimes does not register correctly that you're driving too fast or too slow. Sometimes coming to a full stop registers as adequate speed, with no apparent logic behind it.- You can get stuck on invisible obstacles around road blocks and inside walls in the tunnels.- The helicopter shows up and proceeds to shoot you through the mountainside when in a tunnel.- The road is flickering inside tunnels.- While the game runs smooth, the menu is slow as all hell, also the loading screen locks up for half a minute before starting the game.- I just found out that the menu is not scaled down when you run at a lower resolution. There are some menu items that are simply just not visible when running at 720p, which is bad design.I understand what the developers were going for, but 3 EUR is too much for this. Also, if it is an aesthetic concept please just let me enjoy the music and watch the scenery and not make me rage over the handling and the glitches. Or make it into a proper game."

I do not know yet if there is a finish to the game.1 MAJOR THING. TO RESTART YOU MUST KILL THE WOMEN WHICH IS NOT RESPECT... RESPECT WOMEN!6/10"

It's a good time killer for playing in short bursts. Sometimes I just like to do a mindless task for a little bit while thinking about other stuff, and this game fills that desire. I see some other people compaining about the controls, but they don't seem bad to me. It's just a standard WASD/Shift/Space control scheme. The car itslf doesn't control like a real car, but this isn't a simulator. For a game where all you do is veer left or right and occasionally drift, the controls are fine for me. What matters to me most is that the game is relaxing and the soundtrack is great.I only have one compaint: the graphics revert back to the lowest settings every time you open the game. However, since you always see the settings menu before the game starts, and since there are really only 3 settings to change (resolution, AA, windowed/fullscreen), it literally only takes like 5 seconds to change them back to where you want them. It's not too tedious for me, but it would be nice if it were fixed in an update. I got this on sale for under a dollar so it's hard to nitpick at it, but even at full price... it's only $3. You'll know within the first 15-30 minutes whether or not you like it, and there's always the refund system if you don't. This game definitely isn't for everyone, but if 80's retro / synthwave is your niche, my adivce is to at least give it a try."

,Recommended,441870,34432219,Posted: 23 August,all,Jedzenie,"Mixed feelings on this one. I paid 55 cents for this game, which is why I didn't bother refunding. I would if it cost the full price though.Basically a stunning, beautiful, aesthetically pleasing SHALLOW game.Menu is barebones Unity (and doesn't even save your video or control settings between plays), dying is abrupt, there is no volume or other toggle in the game, etc.To be honest the music is alright for synthwave, but because it slows down when you take damage or lose speed, I found myself turning the entire game sound off in Windows, and just listening to better, higher quality synthwave music off Youtube.Controls are adequate. Sometimes a bit janky, although landing the perfect drift feels nice. Physics likewise get the job done, with little else, especially noticeable in the tedious ""enemy helicopter"" scenes every 8 minutes (which can blow up the road and scatter random debris).All in all feels like a first game project by a dev. A few bugfixes, the ability to import custom music, and a bit more meat on the game side, wheel support (Logitech G27 would be a hoot), customization of car/track/girl/enemies/etc. and MOST importantly endless procedurally generated tracks/roads (instead of the same loop you complete in ~10 minutes and do endlessly after).But considering the dev has basically abandoned this game I don't think any of that will happen. And so OutDrive falls short of it's amazing visuals and potential, which is really quite a sad waste."
