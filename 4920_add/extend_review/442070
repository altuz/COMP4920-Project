You do not need additional copies for each persons phone/device )Group of 4 really enjoyed this game. It was hard to for some to understand how the strategy of the game goes so maybe this will help-First phase: Everyone draws a picture of the Titles provided-Second phase: A players picture is selected at random, all other players observe the drawn picture and create convincing titles for the drawing to be added to the title guessing phase based on what they think the image looks like.-Third phase: Players now get a shot at guessing which Title amongst the player created ones is the Original Title given to the drawer. If you guess the correct Title YOU will be awarded 1000 points.. If another player guesses your ""false"" created title as the original YOU get awarded 500 points. For each CORRECT guess of the Original Title the drawer of the real title will be awarded 1000 points.In closing. You want to guess the correct titles when its your turn to guess... You want to do the best you can to draw a cohesive picture when you are in the drawing phase, because the fastest way to get points is when your Original title is guessed by all other players. 1000 points each...  and lastly when you are in the title creation phase you want to do the best you can to create clever titles for the image to trick other players into thinking your made up title was the drawing title provided.. each player that guesses your false title you will be awarded 500 points.I hope this helps, if its seems strange at first just play a couple rounds. If youre on the fence about this game for a party or gathering dont be...its very fun. def worth the inexpensive price..."

I can not wait until Jackbox Party Pack 3 and I will be buying every game they release day one for the known future.Drawful 2 is a great game IF you don't already own the Jackbox Party Pack 1 and aren't a streamer. This new game is a ton of fun and I will be playing it with my friends constantly in the future. However, I just don't think it's worth the $8 if you already have the original Drawful (in the first Jackbox Party Pack); there just isn't enough different in this version IMO.I think the way they approached the improvements were great- the ability for 2 colors is fun, the ability to seed your own prompts is good, and the increase of the audience was a great idea. But for the way my friends and I play, it just wasn't really any different than Drawful 1.Again, I will gladly donate the $8 to Jackbox Games because they truly understand what makes a good party game and I will continue to support it, but for those less enthusiastic than me I would recommend buying the Jackbox Party Pack games instead."

,Recommended,442070,24343488,"Posted: 15 July, 2016",all,Takao,"Should you play this?Yes/No/DependsA quick summary:You and 3-8 friends draw a randomly assigned and silly prompts and take turns guessing what your friends' topics are.Pros:+Chill music that doesn't get annoying+Easy to pick up. Literally anyone can play this as long as they have a smart phone.+Really great ice breaker at a LAN party or Christmas party or whatever.+Prompts that you're assigned are generally pretty funny+It can be played over skype or a stream or any service that lets you share your screen to an audience+Fun to watch as well with the audience mode.+Allows up to 8 players.+You can make your own prompts.Cons:-You can't play without 3 or more people.-The game only runs at 30FPS as far as I know.-You either play full screen or windowed and you can't change the resolution of the game.-You can't erase when you're drawing. This can lead to funny moments but it can also be frustrating.-No custom rules like number of rounds, how long the turns last, etc.Long reviewDrawful 2 doesn't deviate far from Drawful 1 so if you liked Drawful 1, chances are you'll like this game. The premise is you create a lobby online, you and all your players go to Jackbox's site, log into the lobby and start playing your game based on whatever appears on the host's screen. Lower numbers of players will do 2 rounds, a large group does 1. All in all, the game is really fun when playing with friends and is an easy way to break the ice with people you don't really know, like if you were to have people over and they bring friends/relatives/whatever. Rounds feel like they're just the right amount of length with the only real issue in my opinion  is how long it CAN take but that's more of an issue when playing online and with people who are playing for the first time. After a round or two, it's pretty easy to grasp how to play and rounds are faster.Overall, if you play games with a lot of people pretty often via parties, streaming, whatever, this game is worth picking up. If you play games alone a lot, this might not be as good of a purchase since you need 3 players minimum to play.Gameplay:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J15_IqD9wEQGameplay starts at about 1:09"

Like all Jackbox games, it is organized and the convenience of using your phone as the drawing and text prompt is genius. This is clearly an upgrade and I honestly think the company added some of the features the fans wanted, myself included with the ""Create You're Own"" function in particular. It is what we always wanted with Quiplash. I like that it's sold as a single game unlike the other ""packs"". I'm ridiculously critical of game companies, and although I think for $10 it is a little expensive considering how simple the game is, my opinion is that this company cares about the fans and they have clearly progressed their game making skills with not just money, but the us in mind as well. I love this style of game, its different and it is a ton of fun.I also recommend Quiplash from Jackbox Pack 2, which is potentially more fun because it is the word equivalent of Drawful 2, but they don't sell the games individually, the rounds and content isn't customizable, and it is a less developed game than Drawful 2.TLDR worth it,♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of fun with friends local, different style of game , board game that plays itself"

Tough, good luck trying to turn that mistake into a part of the picture. Given some bread an arm? Haven't we all been there. Good at mind reading and know what your friends are thinking? Think again because they draw just as badly as you do. Did you draw something which is perfect for your suggestion?

,Recommended,442070,23733700,"Posted: 23 June, 2016",all,Techbane,"It's pretty much exactly as advertised, and an all-round improvement on the original in almost every way. I say ""almost"" because while the more subtle additions like streak point bonuses are really clever, 2+ people are now disallowed from giving the same answer. If someone attempts to write the same answer they'll simply be given a refusal prompt saying ""this is too close to the right answer, OR something someone else has already written"", meaning that there will be even MORE nearly-identical answers to pick from per round, AND it's impossible to tell if you've actually stumbled onto the right answer.

Drawful 2 is a 3 – 8  player pictionary-like party game using your phone or tablet. I bought this game because I saw a few of my favourite Let's Players play it, and I always have friends over so why not have an engaging game around.The game itself is very straight forward: sign in on your phone or tablet, join a room, draw what you are given (my personal favourite so far has been 'what jazz feels like'), and then guess what the other players drew. You win by having the most votes. You go through a few rounds and I can guarantee there is at least one good laugh you'll get out of it. Speaking as someone who uses this game solely for parties and get togethers, it's worth having around for the price. The animations, music and announcer are all great, they all mesh together quite well.The one downside is that it isn't too much fun if you play with 3 in my experience, this game is a 4 person minimum in my opinion.  9/10~!"

,Recommended,442070,29214185,Posted: 12 January,all,PandaJerk007,"How to play:(game for 3-8 people)-	Each player receives a strange subject to draw.-	One of the drawings is revealed and you all secretly guess what the drawing is supposed to be.-	The true title for the drawing, and everyone’s guesses, are all displayed as a multiple-choice quiz.-	You have to try and figure out which answer was the original title for the drawing.Positives:-	The game is easy to setup and understand.-	The gameplay stirs up everyone's creative juices.-	The game is a sure-fire way to get people talking and laughing.-	Letting players draw their own avatars is a great way to set a fun atmosphere.Negatives:-	The controls for drawing are a little bit finicky. (Easy to make mistakes)-	No way for a player to erase mistakes as they draw. (The ability to erase could be an optional setting that players turn on or off in the main menu.)Overall:You WILL enjoy Drawful 2 if you play it with family or friends. It could even be a good ice breaker to get to know new people.Instead of buying Drawful 2 bundled in a ""Jackbox Party Pack"", I’d recommend getting it separate. Simply because it’s cheaper that way and it already offers so much gameplay."

I like that they sell it indivually rather than in a jackbox party pack, it's a good option for someone who only wants to spend a couple of bucks (got it on sale). Its the most fun to play in person but if that is not an option I like to share my screen on skype and play with friends over the internet."

I always had issues with trolls coming to the stream and purposly drawing lewd images or curse words for their amusement and to overall ruin the fun for everyone involed and this game helps allivate the trolls. They have to sign in with their twitch account and if they're banned from your channel they can't play. You can also make your own lobby, custom cards and topics! It's incredible interactive and fun for on stream play or for private gatherings! I highly recommend!"
,Recommended,442070,25547969,"Posted: 17 September, 2016",all,Akya_,A really fun game if you have lots of friends or if you are a big family! I only owned this game for 3 days now and already have like 5-6 hours played on it! The only downside I could think of is that you need 3+ players to play and also all of them have to own a smartphone or a tablet to connect. Other than that it is alot of fun and really great to pass the time with friends!
,Recommended,442070,26210100,"Posted: 24 October, 2016",all,Tim,"So fun!The prompts think of everything. There's a great mix of completely wild and mundane subjects and wide variance in formatting/word choice/brevity and longwindedness. You can't guess reliably based on the writing style of the developers.The two colors add some interesting depth to the game. They sort of widen the skill range by allowing you to draw with more specificity. I find that a huge plus! It's the perfect middleground between lolsorandum party gaming and Pictionary--not stuffy, fast and breezy, but still satisfying as a game.Particularly, the scoring system is great. EVEN IF YOU CAN'T DRAW, YOU CAN COMPETE! Selecting the correct drawing prompt outside of your turn gives you as many points as having players guess your drawing prompt correctly (1000 points). Other players selecting your given fake prompts will score you 500 points. It keeps the game on-track but doesn't outright DISCOURAGE silliness.I wish the line width was a lot smaller, and this is a complaint a LOT of people had--we managed to draw very clearly anyway, but it was more of a frustrating hassle than a ""hahahaha"" feature (such as there being no eraser, which I think is a good choice).Thank you, Jackbox, for giving me and my friends a wonderful evening!"

Well, if you got a WACOM/Bamboo tablet working working properly, otherwise your going to be having a bad time with a mouse.It is a major improvement over the first one; while it keeps most of the same mechanics, it has two noticeable additions that really enhance the experience.The first is the addition of two-tone colouring; this allows the player to be more creative with their work.And finally, you get to set up your own game; meaning you and the other players can add prompts into the round. Which means more ways to make the game really weird."

Maybe a little disparity between people using tablets and phones but nothing to major as long as the phone is fairly new-ish.Can get some very outlandish criteria which makes for a lot of fun.

It's better than drawful 1 in the sense that you get two colors to paint with instead of only one, but the phrases are a LOT less clever.You get a lot of random word salad like ""Velcro Shirt"" that is pretty much impossible to do anything clever with. So when all the answers are revealed, there's no ""Oh I get it"" moment. Everyone just kinda shrugs and says ""Oh, cracker fish. that's weird.""You can make up your own but as far as I know there's no way to download better answer packs from the community."
