76561198036684715,Recommended,442210,21940004,"Posted: 20 March, 2016",all,Anxarcule,"Steam recommended this game on release day so I checked out the videos and it looked interesting.  Over the course of the next week I watched a few let's plays which looked better and better, and saw how active the dev is with answering questions - you can see the guy's passion for this game, and he alludes to some really cool future features.Realizing this is early access, I am having a TON of fun with this game.  After splattering my head a number of times during the first hour, I find the game is pretty easy to learn.  Once you understand the controls it's a matter of experimenting with the mechanics to optimize your game play, but I feel like mastering this game still takes long enough to keep you coming back.The first few games I played I either died immediately (either splattering my head on a car/bus/plane/house, or jumping out of a car and getting run over on a racetrack) but after ~5 hours of playing I can regularly get to stage 7/8.  The unlocking system is really cool as the more challenging terrains only unlock once you get past a certain stage - the first time I was in the space stage it was pretty nuts, and the alien world where you can spawn 4 aliens if you don't have a car are hilarious.Even death can be funny as most games don't last more than 10 minutes, which I think makes this a rogue-like for people who don't normally like perma death.  You also have a graphical tally of all the cars you've used that run which is really fun to watch for some reason.  Each car you enter gets entered into a database which for completionists like me is great - with over 1000 cars I'm at 400 so far and loving it!One of the best things about this game though, is of course the cars!  You can store 3 cars to be swapped between at any time, and can always ditch a saved car for a new one.  The variety is staggering, and the small details in the pixel art is amazing (drive through a muddy level and your vehicle will get mud on it, that will slowly clean off as your drive away).  One of my early games I drove through a battlefield and got 3 different tanks, which I used to get stage 7, swapping when running out of fuel and blasting everything out of my way, including killing 6 or so aliens - very satisfying!When not in a car, you have the ability to run around on foot with a permanent grappling hook which you can use to catapult yourself forward dodging the object as you approach, drag yourself closer to a vehicle to hop into it (several initial runs will be lost when learning how to enter the car as you as speeding towards it).  Most of the time you'll only be in the ""on foot"" stage for a split second as the swap cars.Scattered throughout the levels are powerups which range from cosmetic to amazing.  Repair all/ refuel all are fairly common (and highly useful), but there is something very satisfying with turning a battleship armed with rockets into an offroad vehicle, arm a sports car with a tank's cannon.  Because each object has a mass of their own, the lighter vehicles smash into pieces when hitting a heavy object/vehicle, but the big heavy vehicles can plow through almost anything.  The battleship mentioned above eventually was given nitrous (replacing the rockets - doh!) and smashed through EVERYTHING it ran into.  One of my first wow moments was finding and entering a stationary WW2 cannon, storing it for use when aliens showed up and swapping to it to blast them to pieces, eventually adding a fuel engine powerup so I can drive it.To sum it up, this game is very very promising for early access.  There are some quirks to work out, but the game ran bug-free for me and was highly enjoyable.  Also if you don't always have time for longer gaming sessions, this is a great game to load up for a few runs.Very excited to see what new updates have in store!"

76561198038753415,Recommended,442210,21750424,"Posted: 10 March, 2016",all,Mrgrimm150,"A few days ago I came into some money. Like any responsible person I spent that money on steam. I bought 3 games, two of which I returned, the third I've been playing every day since i bought it.Switchcars is the third game. It drew me in with it's art style and 'gimmick'. Said gimmick is switching vehicles at breakneck speed to adapt to your current terrain which changes every few seconds or so. Your goal is to travel from 1950 to 2055. Simple no? You'll be going much faster than 88 miles per hour though. The game gives you over 1000 vehicles to achieve this goal. Ranging from a rocket so fast that I just crashed it into an asteroid to...a shopping cart with no engine.Said shopping cart can be given an engine though through 1 of 41 powerups you find on your journey. Things like drills and rocket thrusters can adorn your vehicle as you hurtle forward through time. Of course you can't get to 2055 in one tricked out shopping cart.You have three vehicle slots which you can store vehicles in for a rainy day. A good variety of vehicles is necessary. Sure three supersonic planes sounds good and fast but they don't have that much fuel and are about as useful as...well a shopping cart when that fuel runs. Three solar powered race cars might be smarter but they wont be very good in an underground cave...full of lava. The three slots add a lot of on the spot thinking to the game which helps make the experiance engaging.I do have a few gripes. It is very easy to feel cheated when your last car brakes down on a rocky field where nothing drives and a space worm is doing a full body tapdance on you. It can also be easy to lose track of what you've driven before which makes completion a bit trickier. However the dev is very active in the forums addressing suggestions and problems quickly and politely.I personally reccomend Switchcars for one of those games you play for an hour or so every day. I would say to atleast wait for one major update to fix some of the bigger problems like resouloution and audio control but other than that I liked it. So go on, its a bit of fun for a relatively cheap price."

The game’s difficult in a way that it intensely and constantly challenges your reflexes and concentration levels all at once. With perma-death being a thing, one wrong move and you die which ends the run entirely. I personally think it's a really well thought out idea and formula that makes the game really addictive. Would love to see the full release."

It's super fast paced and includes giant green space carp worms? Anyway, it's definitely worth checking out.The player starts out as some dude just running around and, as quickly as possible, you'll jack a nearby vehicle to start moving right. The really interesting mechanic is how the map changes as you move. If you move far enough you'll pass through time rifts. These bring you to a new map with a different theme and different vehicles. Different terrain effects vehicles and the real skill is in knowing how to switch between vehicles smoothly.There's also the grappling hook. Quite frankly, that thing has it out for me. I've been killed more time by high speed collisions due to grappling hook accidents (I'm looking at you hot air balloon) than anything else. With a higher degee of skill however (or maybe just some skill), it can be a powerful tool to move you forward much quicker when you're on foot.If you take too long between safe points, giant green carp with teeth descend from the sky to wreak havoc upon your tiny, unprepared body. You just have to hope that yuou can evade the beast long enough to get to the next safe zone.The controls are very tight and each type of vehicle has its strengths and flaws. The graphics are good anough that each type of vehicle is distinctive while not being too distracting. Overall, it is definitely a great game to play when you have a couple minutes to spare. I'd say that it's worth the usual price tag, but would be an absolute steal on sale."

,Recommended,442210,21684092,"Posted: 7 March, 2016",all,Techbane,"I love the concept, and it's certainly a more in-depth and strategic breed of endless runner than anything else I can think of. The cool parts are everything that you see in the trailer, and it's as fun as it looks. The parts that frustrate me are getting stuck with a long string of crappy vehicles or only a single usable lane, how many vehicles look similar but are night and day in performance, powerups that do such productive things as turning your vehicle into a mutant railcar when there aren't any rails for miles in either direction, and the game currently hangs if you're playing in windowed mode and move the cursor outside the window.It's also incredibly easy to kill yourself with the all-important grapple hook intended to get extra momentum or snag onto vehicles. In fact I've lost every single game so far to a grapple suicide incident. Most other things including the time monsters will do gradual damage to your health, but if you forget to let go of the grapple button before catching up to the tree you're hooked on your friggin' neck just snaps like a twig. That seems like it shouldn't really be a thing.I like it though! Just some weird kinks here and there."

I love the randomly generated biomes and the random mixes that can happen, although sometimes it's quite frustrating to not have an appropriate vehicle for the biome, it is a lot of fun to try and beat the clock with what you have.- Really unique concept. I have never played a game that is in the same genre as this one. It's fast paced, brutal difficulty, and the art style is beautiful.Cons- Issues with fullscreen mode and windowed mode. Sometimes game forgets that you want to play in window mode and it loads up fullscreen thus messing up the window sizes of all other open applications- Progression is a bit confusing. Game seems to add +2 years to the starting year every time you have a semi-successful run (more than 20 years skipped)"

Unlike other Steam games, which I stopped playing after a while, I kept coming back to Switchcars time and again. However, since I upgraded to Windows 10, it got really laggy. I don't know if it's my PC or if it's the game, because I got Windows 10 after the most recent update. Bets are it's my PC. Aside from my PC being laggy, this game is SOLID. Music is great and, having played the game several times, doesn't get annoying. Glitches are far and few between, the controls are easy to remember, yet complicated enough to give  you a challenge, and the level design and sheer amount of vehicles are just fantastic.

,Recommended,442210,26326579,"Posted: 30 October, 2016",all,Nicking HC,"For Switchcars, the main question a future game buyer may ask is ""Can I wait?"" Obviously, it's not because the game is unpolished and far from good standards, or because there is unreleased content that was promised by the developer which wasn't delivered. Essentially, what you the buyer needs to know is whether or not you can live with two types of gameplay as of the moment of writing, or wait for a better chance down the line where the game may (or may not) have more to offer for you.The gameplay concept is a basic one at first glance, but there is meat to it. Just don't expect massive lists of controls; you enter vehicles, you exit vehicles, you install and use powerups, and move. That's about it. The reason why this works so well is because there isn't a single run you will make that feels the same as a previous one. The vehicle variety is enough to distinguish countless eras and classes of vehicles, the powerups add plenty of possible variations to said vehicle variety. Want to see if you can move a gun turret? That's possible. Do you think a train would work better with a rocket thruster? Have at it. Finding these combinations of vehicles and powerups is a part of what makes this game fun, the rest being made of the adrenaline which comes from running away from aliens with a limited time frame.Needless to say, this game isn't without its issues. The main one is that while there are two types of game modes, there aren't fleshed out yet; the Run and Hardcore modes are only different in difficulty and session length, and the Free Run mode still lacks the flexibility of a proper sandbox mode. This means that if you play the game for long periods of time, you may get bored easily if you are looking for mode variety and not things to do within said modes. And if you dislike grid-based games, you are not going to like this one, because the grid-based movement is key to how the game is played. But as I said before, no one knows what will be done to this game in terms of future additions. Things like Steam Achievements have been teased, so they are a plausible possibility, and other things like resolution support are available, albeit in Beta format.For me, this game never gets boring because of the powerups and the vehicle variety which is currently offered. But if you love to have countless game modes and hunt for achivements, the game doesn't quite offer that just yet. If you love fresh concepts and pixel game hommages, give this one a go, certainly... But be prepared to fight some mean green aliens!"

I'm sure there are bugs somewhere in the game, but I did not run into anything that caused a crash or that seemed to be out of place during my playthroughs.Switchcars is a side-scrolling, vehicle ""running"", rouge-like game. It succeeds in drawing you back in when you fail (as these types of games should) even as it seems absolutely bent on frustrating your every effort to reach the end.At 8.99 it is a bargain already and if you have any interest in the game or enjoy the genre, I would suggest not hesitating to pick it up.I was able to reach the end at just under 8 hours. I have no idea if that is ""fast"" or ""slow"" for others. Regardless it is not a bad dollar per hour exchange.
