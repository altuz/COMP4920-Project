As Advertised.I don't know what I was thinking when I paid full price for this game; it's bad. Have you ever sat in class and put dots on the page until your hand went numb? That's this game in a nutshell. It's like paying $1 to get a quick 100% achievement in the books. Completion of the game takes 5-30 minutes!The game starts out by you simply clicking dots on the page, those dots explode and make new dots. You then click those new dots to make more dots. Here's where it gets interesting... Those new dots... they have to be clicked again to make more dots! It's amazing.It’s worth nothing. Don't buy this.

,Not Recommended,442290,21392009,"Posted: 22 February, 2016",all,Apoch Weiss | Apochs.net,"tl;dr: Game's literally pointless with god awful hit detection. For details, continue reading:'Pointless' is a game all about clicking dots, and no, it's just not that simple. Not because it isn't simple, but because it isn't programmed to be simple. Not because it's clearly intentional. But because the programming just basically sucks. And you know it does when the first thing you're greeted with is a mock Gameboy screen meant to bring up nostalgia of a two-bit variety, only making the game look cheap and completely unoriginal, not to mention make you want to pull out that old brick of a portable handheld instead of play this. On top of that you have a repetitive score and random sound effects that mirror that system's capabilities, yet quickly grate on your nerves the more time you spend listening to them. Honestly, some of the cheap knock-off handheld companies back in the day had higher standards, though the Nintendo today may be willing to slap it up on their DS/3DS e-store.Of course the huge problem about this title becomes immediately apparent with the first click of the mouse once the actual ""game"" starts, and that is the hit detection is pure garbage. No, I wasn't just sitting here clicking tiny dots on a filthy laptop screen, though I admit it did happen more times than I'd like to admit to, but I found myself clicking upwards of twenty times rapid fire to get one single dot, only to watch it vanish and be forced to move on to the next in hopes of actually gaining that one point. In just ten seconds I conceded it'd just be easier to sit around waiting for the L power-up to show so I could have a little fun with it without the use of an auto-clicker hotkey script running in the background in a feeble attempt to rack up achievements to my Steam account.On top of that, 'Pointless' has no penalty system in place, so sitting around in no way hinders your progress. You're best bet is to just click and use one of five weapons, only three of which seem to have any real use. Pulse places three pulsating obstacles on the screen at points of your choice and, if done right, will spread the dots and rack up thousands in one go. Bomb is nice if you have a number of clustered dots on screen as well. But then you have laser, which is the most enjoyable, allowing you to hold the left mouse button down and automatically click. This one is best done by making small circular motions to rack up a decent amount of dots. These three work very well together if done right as well, but long (black rectangle that crushes dots) has minimal benefit. There's also chain, but I genuinely have no idea what it does, if anything at all.There are a few options, but they are as basic, and disappointing, as the title itself. There's music and sound effect volume controls, as well as an option to change the background ""color palette"", but only after you destroy so many dots to unlock the other two distinctly bland colors of peach and tomato red. Yes, that's all the cosmetic changes the development team has allowed. God forbid you get a third color scheme to unlock or new ""game girl"" handheld border because  us clicking pointlesly at pointless dots wouldn't possibly know what to do with that much power at our disposal other than watch the credits and add our pointless total to a pointless global score to show the world how collectively pathetic we as Steam users are in this day and age.Thankfully for achievement hunters, these are simple to rack up with some help. If you have an auto-clicker program or a script that runs in Hotkey, something I wound up abusing by the six thousand dot mark and realized how little I could be bothered to try to click the many fleas infesting the digital handheld device that wouldn't die even when I properly clicked on them in the first damn place. You can scoff at the idea but, trust me, it's almost necessary to do this since you have to have the game the active window at all times in order to get any weapons or new dots to appear on the screen.'Flea Extermination Simulator 2016' is, well, a thing that exists. Is it a game? Not necessarily. Remember the old 'Game & Watch' style of handheld games? Well just picture a bunch of fleas somehow got into one of those, and it's up to you to exterminate them all before they take over your house. This is 'Pointless', both in title and execution. The only goal this title serves is to add another cheap and quick one hundred percent complete title to the list of Steam games with achievements. Sadly, without caving and using an auto-clicker, you'll find it quite a tendious, fairly broken experience that will leave you questioning where you went wrong in life that you're playing something worse than the recently released failure that is 'Bonsai'. Hopefully the developer becomes kind enough to throw some bonus colors or backgrounds into the mix, maybe an actual game or mini-game to breathe life into this waste of a dollar but, until then, 'Pointless' is an absolutely ""pointless"" experience for anyone who's game completion percentage score and achievement count doesn't mean the world to them."

And that was only because of the 100.000 dots achievement.Mentally I was done after 5-10 minutes.You click dots and that's the core of the game. Is it worth it over a pack of cookies? You decide.I honestly went to the store before this and my cookies weren't as expensive as this game on sale.There's better clicking games like cookie clicker and clicker heroes that are free.In my opinion this game should be free aswell. If you're struggling for money, don't buy this game.If you want easy achievements and steam cards, go ahead and buy it on sale."

,Not Recommended,442290,21554599,"Posted: 29 February, 2016",all,The Cat,What is the point of this game? Who thought that this game would be a good idea? Why does this game even exist?This is exactly what you're probably thinking about right now if even a shred of sanity exists in your mind. All that this game entails of is clicking an endless horde of pixels that explode in disappointing fashions. As the title suggests this game is 'Pointless' in every sense of the word and if I hadn't been given a 90% off Coupon this review would have never been created.So please... if you somehow enjoy clicking and only clicking you will be glad to know that this title is right up your alley. If you enjoy things beyond clicking thousands of times then you should shuffle on from this page as quickly as possible as not to waste precious moments of our so very short lives.

,Recommended,442290,23238195,"Posted: 27 May, 2016",all,Redbeard,"Pointless is a stupid clicker game, one which is - as the name says - pointless.You click on a dot, which then blows up into a whole bunch of other dots, which you click on, and then they blow up, and so on it goes.After a while the dots go away, but then more dots come along.You get to click on the dots with ""weapons"", which are meant to be lasers, bombs, etc., but which are no more than pixelated items which blow up even more dots. They don't look like weapons, but that doesn't really matter; after all, the game is pointless.Pointless is a good example of truth in advertising. The game's advertising blurb says that ""Pointless is a game about destroying Dots"". The various reviews of the game on Steam confirm that fact.If you expect anything more from this game other than clicking on dots, then you're missing the point (ha ha, pun intended).The only useful thing about this game is that Stat Junkies can get 100% of the achievements in under 20 minutes.The only other reasons that I can think of for playing the game is if you want to get a high ranking on the global leaderboard, are after some Steam cards, you find the game relaxing in some sort of fashion, or you are just looking to kill some time (and some dots).Basically, the game is rubbish; but the developers have made that obvious right from the start, so kudos to them for being honest (hence the positive review - the game delivers on what it promises).If you buy this game to get some amazing entertainment, you need your head read.However, if you are looking to get an easy 100% achievement game, then this is the game for you.If you buy it on that basis (preferably when it's on special, or if you have a coupon for it), then you can't go wrong."
