The current one to get better times is great and all but a higher system than just 99k and lvl 10. New game+ could take it to level 200 and then some.Steam why cant you give me a neutral button. The graphics are great and so is the sound track. The game is fine in its tiny form but could be much better to suit the price tag on it.At 5$ its a good price.

It's a nice game to play, with great effect quality, and (definitely not leaving this out) AMAZING music! For a game with very little action, it has very good music that I found myself enjoying immensly!As stated above, it's an extremely short game (although longer with the hard mode), but it's definitely one to look for when on sale. Heck, it's on sale for a dollar off, and while I wouldn't recommend it too strongly to others at that price, I'm definitely keeping this game."

There's actually not much interactivity, it's  kind of like a slightly more interactive Progress Quest.Gameplay is as follows: You send the main character, Pastel, in to the dungeon and she will automatically kill things and gather reagents as she travels down.  Whenever either of those actions occurs she gains RP, which can be spent on various skills from bonus damage to more health to bonuses against specific enemies.  Every 10 floors or so there will be a boss battle, which is basically just an enemy with more HP.That's the whole game.  And you can max out and beat it fairly quickly, before getting all the Steam Cards even!  I thought it was cute and idly fun enough to be worth the price, but that is up to the individual."

Its just a upgrade idle game ...2nd Its so short you can play free games else where with more content than this. Its amusing for about two hours when you max everything and just let it run to the end. Less if you have played idle games. Has 0 replay insentive other than to get a s rank and it starts you all over to do this not worth the price at all when compared to what you can play for free even here on steam.
,Not Recommended,442890,30708518,Posted: 24 March,all,Rehio,"Not a good game. Even getting it at 60% off I feel like I didn't get any value out of it. This is more akin to a semi-polished flash game.Very, very little interaction with the game. You kind of just have it on in the background and check back every couple minutes.No challenge or decisions to be made. Even choosing between upgrades doesn't really matter. You're gonna reach the same place no matter what you upgrade first.Short, as well. There could potentially be some merit to be found in going for a ""high score,"" but in order for that to matter you have to care about the game in the first place, and I can't imagine many will."
,Recommended,442890,21772374,"Posted: 11 March, 2016",all,Dr. Arbitrary,"If you're unfamiliar with the genre of Idle/Incremental games, you may want to do some research before buying this game.If you are, and you like those games, this is probably right up your alley.The art, music, interface and all the other little details are well polished.The game is fairly hands off. You automatically proceed through the dungeon and only interact by purchasing new upgrades.So far, the content seems a bit limited, I don't know if it's worth the full price. On sale, it may be a more palatable purchase.One thing about this genre though is that there are often surprises. If I get a few hours in and find that it really opens up, I'll update this review accordingly.Edit:Looks to be about 2 hours of gameply. I don't have much desire to play it again. Maybe they'll improve it in the future.Something little like a bonus perk every time you complete the game would go a looong way for replayability."

Short as heck, but darn it, I enjoyed myself. But get it on a sale; it's not worth full price.(PS: Don't wear headphones. The volume balance of the BGM will make you dizzy)"

,Recommended,442890,29371016,Posted: 19 January,all,kevinski,"Wow...this game was quite the surprise. I expected something along the lines of Recettear, but Magic Potion Explorer is more or less a dungeon-crawler combined with a clicker/tapper. This will probably appeal more to fans of clicker/tapper games, but I suggest that you check it out if you're interested in playing a game that's very grindy and accelerates that grinding in a very satisfying way."
76561197980630589,Not Recommended,442890,21940832,"Posted: 20 March, 2016",all,Blike,"This game is a basic clicker / time sink game. You don't really do anything aside from spend points to not have to start over as often. The game extends itself by putting in roadblocks to start you over if you haven't leveled up enough before them.The music and character are good, but not for the $10 asking price. If it were on sale for a couple dollars, you might find it worth that."
,Recommended,442890,21938924,"Posted: 19 March, 2016",all,GameDragonZero,"SUMMARY: A cute ""auto-adventure"" game that's sort of a ""casual min-maxer"" (trust me).  The usual price may be a bit high unless you really want to delve into different play modes and achievements, but the easy-yet-challenging rules, clever streamlined presentation, and fun soundtrack make it worth keeping an eye on.Magic Potion Explorer's plot is simple - a young alchemist complains about her need to find ingredients, and a mysterious woman provides her a dungeon below her potion shop.  Armed with an alchemic squirtgun, our heroine Pastel, wanders into the dungeon.  There she harvests resources, battles monsters, and brews potions on her way to figure out what's up, and who's butt she has to kick to get this abomination removed from beneath her store.The gameplay itself is simple . . .  kind of.Magic Potion Explorer's adventuring is completely automated.  Pastel goes through the dungeon, find resources, and battles monsters.  Your goal as the player is to choose which potions she brews to affect her abilities.  That's where it gets a bit complex.Magic Potion Explorer is essentially a casual game for min/maxers who love to tweak abilities.  Some abilities add, some multiply, some affect capacity, some healing.  There's an entire screen just of the math behind the character.  Having to choose which potion to brew - or if to wait to gather enough resources to unlock others - is a core part of the game.Depending on difficulty, if Pastel is defeated she returns to her shop or she returns without any potions and starts over except for some bonus resources.  Fortunately the deeper you get the more the game accelerates easier levels, so you can keep delving in less and less time.The game is also accompanied by a great, dynamic soundtrack; the frenetic auto-adventuring and the fast-paced music played during the game really set the mood, the incidental music for calmer moments is a nice contrast.  I'd say the soundtrack is a major strength of Magic Potion Explorer.Is this game worth it?  The game's two different play modes and multiple achievements will provide some challenge if you're up for them, though the deliberately limited and focused gameplay may not be for everyone.  At $9.99 it's something to think over - if it was cheaper I'd be a little freer to reccomend it.I bought it and had a ball.  It was a nice casual/intense mix that I was looking for at the time, and I always like to see games experiment.So who should get Magic Potion Explorer.* Someone who wants a kind of casual/stats-raising mix.  It's a good evening game for someone so inclined.* Someone into streamlined games and games that play with modes.  As a study in creating an effective minimalist game, it's quite good.* If you're not sure and the game is on sale enough to make you sure."

,Recommended,442890,34542265,Posted: 27 August,all,Habo St.,"As someone who has become extremely jaded and cynical and pessimistic in their years on this earth, this game was a spot of sunshine in an otherwise dreary existence.There's not a lot of active playing to be had, it's mostly just clicking the odd thing here and there and watching your numbers go up. Mostly it's about strategizing which upgrades to pick at what time, to maximize efficiency. It's not really a clicker, it's more of an idle game like some others have pointed out.Even if you suck sh*t at the game like I do you can beat it simply through patience, since upgrades carry over between runs, unless you are playing on hard, which will only reward you with a set amount of upgrade points everytime you die up to a maximum, after which you won't get anymore."
