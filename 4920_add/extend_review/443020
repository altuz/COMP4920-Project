Well, here's the DEAL...V&G:N is a FUN GAME.It is NOT heavy on the history, although there is a LOT of incidental history, the factions, nations involved etc.It is NOT a simulation of Napoleonic warfare, but that means it's not inaccessable to the casual gamer either.What it is, is a very FUN computer version of the flavor of the Napoleonic era with board game aspects. It is VERY PLAYABLE.It is pretty challenging and the combat system has just enough ""rock, paper, sissors"" to let you shine as a tactical genius (at times).It has a great Event Cards feature that really makes it feel like a board game.It is colorful, has a GREAT SOUND TRACK (somebody complained about the music track and I am here to tell you the music selections (classical) are PERFECT for the period being dramatized).Overall it is a GOOD VALUE for the price and there is a TON of replayability built in. A lot of ways to approach winning.I highly recommend it"

I have played many grand strategy games and after a while alot of them seem to slow down to a grind with a rather clear path to victory. This game is slightly different. You may very well be able to win by just holding europe as a whole and posting an army to keep the contenental resistance down. But... you could really use those extra point from completely subjugating spain and Austria's not gonna rule itself (at least not while your tearing it down anyway) and russia sure doesn't seem to long of a walk in the summer, and by the way did we mention your allies the ottomans just ran out of their army fighting russian so the only thing standing between you and india is some *slight* royal navy presence and a few remaining ottomans. Conquering the world (or what matters of it) seems to be a piece of cake. Till everyone else learns how to fight. Then quite a few countries are going to come knocking with new training and equipment and very rudly ask for their stuff back, from you, in person, at paris (and only at paris). So you have to stop the conquest of random Italians and Ottomans to re-finish off the austrians and russians meanwhile the British keep you locked away from your troops in egypt and the spanish seem a bit peeved at your suggestions of ""synergy"". So you wind up trying to keep and empire the size of europe+1 together with shoestrings shot and strategy (and a ton of cursing the british). So in short I love this game. Buy it if you like grand strategy but don't want to know the name of every french sergant involved in the french reconquista."

I've played nearly 140 hours and enjoyed every moment of it.It has surprising depth under the guise of simple rules. You will know if you either read the manual or play a difficult campaign.The game has a lot to offer. It's casually fun, and if you are looking a challenge, playing the last scenario in emperor difficulty will likely be the hardest gaming experience you've ever had. It has tons of replayability.This game would have been really great if the Dev was able to fix those grievances(British amphibious landing, enemy retreat indicator and direction; pretty much the only complaints I have about the game), but alas it didn't sell well enough for patches.Still this is the game I've poured most time into among Napoleonic games; I own many Napoleonic titles and this one was among the best. I played VG:N far more than  I played Napoleon Total War.Recommended if you like board games and like fun battles. Not recommended if you are looking for some deep diplomacy and complicated mechanics."

Balancing constant warring and rushing from one crisis to another seems very napoleonic.The more I play, the more I enjoy it. There is a lot of gameplay here for the price.Pros* Thoughtful and interesting design.* Battles make you think, and feel 'right' -- you use your cavalry to force squares, and then pound the square with artillery. Units with skirmishers can easily disrupt other units without skirmisher. Intact cavalry is used to screen (or pursue) the loser after the battle.* The AI puts up a really good fight even with no advantages.* Art design is great.* Compelling -- worst case of ""1 more turn"" I've had in a long time.* Developer seems quite active.Cons* I'd love to see the ability to play the Allies.* Sound effects and music are not very good. I turned sound off, but ymmv."

Simple as that.I was waiting with this review to see how much support the game is going to get after release. The game was released on March 17 and there is still no official patch to it (there is beta patch since a month now, I can't call that good support).The core of the game is quite nice, but there are glarrying issues (especially AI in battles, which is really bad, extremely predictable and exploitable) and the game just doesn't offer that much. I could recommand the game if it was 10 €, but not for 28 €, that's way too much for the content you get. There are simply many other strategy games of similar (or bigger) depth as this, which are cheaper and get more support after release. I don't think I'm going to buy another Slitherine released game any time soon. Every time I did it, it was the same thing - high price, not that deep gameplay and very little post-release support.However, if you don't care about price that much (or, unlikely, there is a good promo when you read this), the game is still fun for several hours and you can try it. Maybe the patch (when it finally comes) will fix some of the issues I had."
76561198016874266,Recommended,443020,24660041,"Posted: 1 August, 2016",all,Bruiser,"Wow what a great game. Don't let the simple-looking interface fool you - this is hours and hours of fun and is as thoughtful a period grand-strategic simulation as you'll find. It beautifully captures the military, naval, geopolitical and international dynamics of Napoleonic history like no other game I've played.The game effectively balances the military prowess of France against the political power of England and Europe's balance-of-power politics. France's armies are great and you will win battles, but England is always on a mission to build a new coalition to oppose you. And if you think you will just blitzkrieg Europe to conquest you will be frustrated by the major powers just as quickly alligning to take you down - thoughtless military aggression will lead you to your own personal Waterloo. Instead, careful strategum, divide-and-conquer politics, and opportunistic empire and kingdom building will be your path to Victory.Battles are simulated on a tactical map, and reflect the linear (left flank, center, right flank) nature of Napoleonic battles. Hammer the enemy with your Grand Battery? Send forward swarms of skirmishers to disrupt his defences? The enemy is weakening on the left - commit the Imperial Guard now? The enemy has retreated - is your cavalry fit to pursue and hack him down?I've seen some reviews critical of Britain's substantial naval advantages, and the Royal Navy is truly superior! But if you think Napoleon's navy could just fight the Brit's on even terms, you should ask Admiral Villenueve about that... Instead, use a long-term strategy. I waited until I could distract England with a war in America in 1812, then built my Dutch and Danish navies while augmenting my own, hit the Brits with storm and mutiny cards, and I was able to achieve naval superiority and landed Nappy in London for an epic victory.Politics are much more realistic than, for example, another favorite, the Total War series.  In Victory and Glory, a defeated enemy will not attack you again the turn after you sign a peace treaty (I hate that in TW!). You will have a passive neutral for not less than a year. Even then, it will take the Brits' political pull and your own aggressive actions to turn them into active enemies.Build the Kingdom of Naples and the Duchy of Warsaw! Form the Confederation of the Rhine and recruit Germans like crazy! Slaughter Spanish partisans! It's all there and more - if  you love the Napoleonic Wars like I do, this game is the best strategic simulation I've seen."

,Recommended,443020,24899271,"Posted: 13 August, 2016",all,Exciting Jeff,"I love this game so much, especially considering that it's the digital equivalent of a Glenn Drover Kickstarter game. But it's not exactly a Glenn Drover original; it's a variation on the obscure PC game Hannibal - Rome and Carthage, itself a variation of an old board game. I prefer Hannibal, for two reasons: subject matter and length. But this is a solid entry, with a fun battle engine and a simple tactical map.There are a few things that are annoying, and if it wasn't already a game I was more or less familiar with, they'd be unforgivable.What sucks about this game?1. The tutorials are links to YouTube videos. This is the worst thing. It is the video game equivalent of a war crime.2. The victory conditions are opaque. I lost my first campaign mostly because of Portugal. That's annoying in a 5+ hour campaign.3. This needs an undo button for moves. No excuse. Do it.So I have my UI gripes, but if you're considering playing this game, you've played games with much worse UIs. Pick this up. It's rad."
76561197986331836,Recommended,443020,26380654,"Posted: 2 November, 2016",all,CharlieChap,"Simple Napoleonic era Grand Strategy game that feels and plays like a boardgame.The game does not straight jacket players into rigidly following any kind of historical course of action  but the positive aspect of this is that the player has a lot of freedom,The AI seemed pretty reasonable (often a fatal weekness in fluid strategy games).When and if nations declare war is dependant upon the play of the cards and use of political influence points won by defeating enemy nations. Other historical events are triggered by a card system that fits well within the system and adds an interesting historical veneer to the game and also add unpredictability.It captures the mood of the era and of the scale represented  I think.2 reservations though currently:-played it through once on fairly high difficulty after a number of poor starts learning the system and then started a second playthrough before getting distracted., how replayable it is currently for its price. Probably something easily rectified with additional cards though if the developer continues to support the game.Naval warfare is not very good....if you play it as intended the Royal navy is practicaly unbeatable so you may as well ignore the French navy...if you 'game the system'  though its easy to turn it around.The developer has promised to improve this aspect, it should be an interesting part of gameplay rather than a dead loss or something to exploit. But it should have been there from the outset, not as a DLC as the developer has suggested.Nothing else that I know about fills a similar niche at the same kind of complexity and playthrough time.Reasonable game but expensive for what it is."
76561198035652547,Recommended,443020,27926088,"Posted: 28 November, 2016",all,Ginger,"I really like this game, even though I should by all counts hate it. It very much feels like a board game, not just asthetically, but in the ruleset as well. The dice rolls aren't shown, but it's very obvious that there's a lot of random at play. That being said, the combat system doesn't feel dictated by the random, although it certainly is frustrating to miss repeatedly even when you have a +14 modifier.Started out feeling good about the game, a couple hours in and I was tepid, but as I perfected my strategies for the battle system and figured out the more advanced tactics (I think), I came to really enjoy it in the end.Strategic mode is where it unfortunately falls a bit flat. The AI is somewhere between ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and cheesy. Since the only province that actually matters is the capital, the AI will enevitably just bunch 3 armies of 20 guys on vienna and berlin. Diplomacy point system is interesting as a system to keep threats out of the coalition, but your only sources of diplomacy points are conquering nations (at which point you really don't need to keep anyone else out of coalition, since a bunch of your soldier's just became available to reposition), or a rare card draw. And since points for you are so raer, any card that gives points to Britain is almost certainly not worth it.Had a few hair raising moments, but with a bit of luck, I managed to win the 1800 scenario in 4 years plus a fifth to put down the last resistance in Spain.Don't think it has a whole lot more replayability however, to be honest. Might try the gottdamerung equivalent scenario for fun later."
,Recommended,443020,23832801,"Posted: 26 June, 2016",all,Darthvegeta800,"A good boardgame on the Napoleonic Wars.The game has a good replay value, charming visuals and a lot of chrome that adds atmosphere and napoleonic flair to the whole. The tactical combat on land is quite fun though only somewhat Napoleonic due to its abstracted nature. Regardless it is fun and it does incorproate signature elements of the period such as 'square' or the importance of cavalry POST battle.Unit coordination via cards can have awesome results (like having a neighbouring army add it's cavalry and some artillery to an initially even fight... thus allowing you to really finish off the enemy post battle).The AI is decent though still needs a bit off work. HOWEVER I so far only tried the easier difficulty. At the harder levels it may be fiercer.The big downside is naval combat. Unbalanced and boring it's best ignored for now."

Well, it is here! Sort of.So far, I have played through one campaign and I love it. It has some differences from the boardgame (e.g., I dont think calvary can abandon a charge once an infantry forms a square) but it is a great experience. The battle system, a kind of basic miniatures minigame, may seem odd to those unfamiliar with the boardgame. The whole thing may be off-putting if you aren't expecting a virtual boardgame. But if you are the type that fondly thinks of counters and chits and miniatures-this is a solid purchase. My only issue is they have so far chosen to go with a single player  version where the player must be France. This is the proper first choice but I long for multi-player and a British campaign. Still, all in all, it was money well spent."

The game starts a bit slow on the strategic map but the battles once they begin are fun and tactical interesting without being brain burners.  Then the strategic decision start to have more interest as you way the many problems France faces in conquering Europe.  The AI seems pretty competent overall.  Last night  I was starting to get enough of a handle on the tactical play to feel I good crush anything and then the Russians almost beat Napoleon :-(There is a bit of a whack-a-mole aspect as time progresses and Europe under Britain's spurring refuses to stay conquered. But probably that is not too far off from history.  And unfortunately the 'moles' get tougher and tougher ;-)Recommended.

It's good on strategic level but really shines on tactical (battles) level.It can be challenging but is never unfair. Battles can change rapidly from ""I've got this"" to ""Now I'm fukked"" and back to ""I've got this"" in a minutes. I recommend playing it on hard or at least normal level on ""ironman"" (I've played ""Into Russia"" on hard and managed it at first try, although I got lucky a number of times). I also recommend reading a manual (at least part about battles, as it is important to know the modifiers behind the rolls). It's a bit shame that you can't play as England here, but it makes sense from the gameplay asymmetry perspective. Interface is allright, graphics & music too, no bugs experienced. Thumb up."

Deatiled, beautiful art, strategy at a mid-depth that is easy to grasp without becoming bogged down. However, it's singleplayer only, and as the French side only. If this game was multiplayer it would be the gold-standard Napoleonic online experience. Since this game is derived from a boardgame of the same name, I can clearly see where as a 2 player experience, the nuance and forethought that the AI lacks would make this game one of the favorites in my library.Once you have mastered the combat system, lining up and destroying the opposing armies becomes something you can do without too much problem, and as you level up the troops under Napoleon's command, he mops the floor with any army the coalitions can put on the map.Great game for conquering Europe in an afternoon, and really looking forward to the possibility of multiplayer in the future."

Much faux-complexity lurks here, lots of things you'd have to consult the manual to even guess at but it doesn't matter because it's risk with cards and ultimately after a few hours you'd be better off getting out a vassal module and playing something else; in 1805 the Brits landed in Denmark with a huge army despite historically having a tiny army, in 1806 the Spanish attacked the french.
