,Recommended,443330,33482853,Posted: 12 July,all,✩ Helenα ✩,"This is another time that I wished that Steam had a neutral option.I myself kinda liked the game, but I honestly don’t see many other people enjoying it. I might be wrong, tho. But well, let me talk about my experience with this visual novel.It’s a kinetic novel, you don’t make any choices and you only read about the MCs fate, Will. He goes to Japan to work as a researcher at a Japanese university, and there he meets his three coworkers: Yuri, a girl that loves water bears with a burning passion and talks about herself in third person; Suzukake, the main researcher and which also is very connected to Yuri; And there’s Yae.Right in the beginning of the game it’s stated that he is a boy. He likes girly stuff a lot, and tries to make moves on Will. I liked because it was something different from the characters that I’m used to see in the visual novels that I play.The art style is gorgeous, I really have no complains. BGM was okay too, and the VA was awesome. The story starts very light and suddenly things change faster than you can say f*ck. The thing is,Malus Codemakes no sense. Its contents are divided between three episodes (which covers Will’s coworkers routes), and none of them are connected. So it’s basically three different storiesabout the Malus Virus. By the end of episode three, it gave me a feeling that all of the episodes were clues for the player to try to solve the big mystery of this VN. But I don’t know, it lacked something. Not that everything needs a clear answer (at least to me, a lot of readers like to have answers and that’s totally fine), but this title made me feel like I was reading a cheap rip off of Higurashi. The concept of Malus Code was somewhat intriguing to be honest, but in my opinion the writing was the biggest problem here. Things are so mysterious that it just ends up being like a total f*cking secret and you barely have hints of what’s happening. At some point it made me not care anymore about the mystery.4/10. I only recommend this game when it’s on a big sale, if you like random creepy stories,ANDif you don’t mind unanswered questions. Also, I only gave a thumbs up because of Yuri’s story (the first episode).Will thought he was going to see some beewbs but he ended up being a nice meal to her. Sometimes turning the lights off is not a good idea, I guess… Anyway, that made me surprised and amused at the same time."
,Recommended,443330,22836241,"Posted: 6 May, 2016",all,Naruchin ☆,"Very peculiar kinetic novel heavy on the slice of life and with just enough horror over the three 'codes' or acts to keep you hooked. You need to play it three times in order to get a better understanding of the plot, as the clues are scattered in the three routes (took me 4 hours in total). Each route is different from the others, and are in order Yuri's, Suzukake's and Yae's.From what I've understood, while each route gives clues to the main mystery, they are all possible outcomes and there is no 'true' route. Some things are left hanging or get unanswered, which makes the puzzling together fun but a bit frustrating. But as the virus says, no matter how much we fail, we will always try to crack the code.The characters are well established and consistent, and you get to know them really well in their own routes. The visuals are  well done, with the e-mote system being smooth and truly giving life to the characters. There are plenty of CGs and they are partially animated as well.The soundtrack was quite small but fit the scene well. Very good voicing!It's a very polished product that occasionally breaks the fouth wall, has some memorable lines (almost everything that comes off Yae's mouth) and is intriguing enough to be finished in one sitting. It was different in a positive and welcome way, as to be expected by this publisher :)"

,Recommended,443330,22971519,"Posted: 14 May, 2016",all,Black Heart Goddess,"A VN with nice artwork and the animation is made using the Emote engine (which was also used in the Nekopara series). The characters are cute and have some decent development, although I thought the story was rather convoluted at times. In some ways, its very similar to Tokyo School Life, in terms of plot (a foreigner coming to Japan, etc).Too bad it is rather short (about 5-10 hours or so), but I guess I'm just saying that because I am used to long VN's. :-)Anyway, if you liked TSL or Nekopara, then you will like this."
,Not Recommended,443330,32293118,Posted: 9 June,all,泥鰍小妹妹,"I just finished this game and I feel... a lot of mixed feelings right now honestly. First off the pros, it has beautiful art, engaging characters even if theirs only three I still enjoyed my time with all of them. It's also a decent sized visual novel in my opinion and left a impression on me. THE CONS HOWEVER, the story has so many unexplained holes, each heroine gets their own episode and they all end up with you wanting answers and left with even more questions. I'm severely sad right now because I really enjoyed this visual novel since it had a plot twist and kept it interesting and different from the generic visual novel. I can't recommend this game for people who don't enjoy cliffhangers, it's a real bummer since it has a lot of potential, but it never follows up on it and just opens more doors that didn't need to be there in the first place..."

,Not Recommended,443330,31003644,Posted: 7 April,all,DragYn,"Okay. I finished it. I think, anyways.  This damn thing was confusing as all Hell.Overall, I'm on the fence about this little VN.  Unfortunately, I feel that the negatives outweigh the positives, so I'm saying ""steer clear""; unless you get it in some form of a bundle or *HEAVY* discount.First, on the plus side, the graphics are top notch. Yuri is cute, Suzukake is naughty-librarian hot, and Yae makes me feel funny and then I feel funny for feeling funny.(Because she's actually a he).  The VN utilizes the Emote system - which I'm definitely a fan of.  It helps bring the characters to life.  Going hand-in-hand is the fact that the 3 main characters (besides you) are also voice acted (in Japanese, as per usual).  Production-wise, Malus Code is great.  But that's about where the positives end.The VN is kinetic, but also has 3 routes.  Yeah, I know it doesn't make sense.  Trust me, nothing in this makes any sense at all.  In order to access the 2nd and 3rd routes, you play through the first story (Yuri's).  It ends . . . abruptly/poorly/badly/stupidly/WTF-ly.  Then you get a new title image and start route 2.  I still don't get how these routes fit chronoligically. I'm going to assume they're more ""alternate"" endings and plots than anything else.  The problem is the game attempts to be very X-Files with it's ""more-questions-than-answers"" formula, but falls flat by basically just giving questions.  Mostly, the question is simply ""huh?"" and then it ends. I imagine it's intended to be creepy and mysterious, but it's really not.  It's bland and befuddling and nothing seems to have anything to do with anything else.The characters themselves are odd at best.  There's not really much depth or even consistency to their personalities.  Well, that's not true.  Yuri always seems like a mental child, Suzukake is always kind of the hot-but-smart ♥♥♥♥♥, and Yae is . . . whatever the Hell Yae is. The mian problem seems to be with your character, Will. He's a student, or a researcher, or an agent of something or another.  I'm not sure really.  Truthfully, I just didn't care.  The ""romance"" is horribly forced and makes little sense.  One minute, Suzukake is scolding you and the next she's dressed as a succubus at a theme park on a date with you.  The Hell? And that's saying something because this game is chock full of ""What the♥♥♥♥♥♥did I just read and why?"" moments.There are other issues as well (like the total lack of a coherent plot to individual routes, let alone a larger story arc), but I'll leave this there.  At this point, I think you get the picture that while pretty to look at, the game is a mess of randomness that is just plain bewildering.TL;DR - Huh? What? No. Just . . .  what? No."

Three characters each with their own personality and various quirks. Most visual novels I own aren't the best on the store, but this definitely is worth the money and I will definitely strive to finish it when I get the oppurtunity."

The story is split into 3 routes which each focus on a single character, there are no choices in this game (which I am fine with) but there is also a disproportionate amount of filler / story in each route (which I am not that ok with). The relationships that the game builds are vapid and just really uninteresting in general, there are obvious arcs to these relationships but they’re all really predictable with little to no conclusion. I am fine with a story being told in little chunks to make it more impactful, but the story segments that actually matter in this game (not the random chatter between our characters that does nothing but waste time) are seriously lacking in content. The game builds up this idea that there is something bigger going on beneath the surface of this supposedly cutesy charage game but it really just stops before anything that you may be questioning is explained. If you are confused and you expect something to be explained later you are going to be seriously disappointed because you will get no context or reasoning behind scenes that you see in the early game. Even the point where the genre shifts into horror it really didn’t feel that impactful and it just left me feeling confused, which is a feeling that persisted all throughout this game.Positives:+ E-mote engine looks fantastic; I really hope more companies start to use this system in the future.+ Really solid voice acting and sound design, background noise didn't irritate me like it has in some other VNs+ Characters are kinda cute+ Isn’t 15+ hours long so it didn’t waste too much of my timeNegatives:- Bad story- Spelling mistakes in some areas (forgivable in most cases)- Repetitive music- No resolution / ending- Way too much filler dialogue and not enough story progressionSeriously, just go play Saya no Uta or SubaHibi if you’re looking for something nerve wracking to read, only read this if you get it in a bundle with TSL or something but even then be prepared to be disappointed."

There are no choices or routes, you read what happens in the story and that's it. Their are a total of 3 chapters and by the end there will still be many questions left un answered, so don't expect to leave feeling 'complete'.The story takes a lot of basic slice of life elements and mixes them with very brief mystery and horror sub plots. The mysteries never get fully resolved and the horror ends almost as quickly as it begins. Though these portions are highly interesting, they don't happen or last long enough to really leave a lasting impact other then more questions that won't be answered.A very quick and slightly entertaining read, I can't recommend it at this price. For those curious to give it a try it is best to wait for it to be on sale."

Underneath it all is a overriding story that explains a little better what is happening and then it all makes sense.After playing this game, I got the scenarios, but with nothing of substance to tie it all together. That was a little disappointing.The story premise was pretty cool and would have made for a really interesting VN, but the idea was scaled back and turned into this. While this might have been the developers original intent to make something different, I felt like I was dragged along for the ride of a lifetime, then kicked out of the car while it was turning a corner and left to walk back home myself.Oh well, time to move onto the next game and hope it is better.I do have to give thumbs up to the Emote engine. I really like the motion of the characters, hair movement, mouth and eye movement, everything! I hope other VNs will license this technology going forward because it does make the game more enjoyable than a typical static display.----TL;DR - at full price, move on, if in the bundle with TSL and two other games, a much better deal, but you might wish to get your 5-6 hours back once you are done."
,Recommended,443330,22855927,"Posted: 7 May, 2016",all,Yousagi,": There be minor spoilers ahead! :Malus Code is a heavily flawed horror visual novel about a poorly described viral infection.The characters are all good, yet incredibly stupid, twisting themselves around the labrynthian plot. You won't find an easy to consume or understand story in Malus Code. It seems to take twists randomly, which are great for humorous effect but don't make the game very compelling .There are multiple times in the story where the plot sets itself up to study petri dishes, investigate odd medication, or check out strange ramen produced by a pharmaceutical company, but it never happens. It feels like this game was written quickly and haphazardly, and I urge you to pay attention and take note of everytime this game throws pointless red herrings in your face.Just like Malus Code, this review has a twist in it. I highly recomend you buy this game and read it through. IT'S AMAZING. CHRIST. So funny. Be warned that there is no romance or the like, just unbridled so bad it's good."

It's especially evident with the MC, or Will, in the third episode. In the ending he gets...taken over...I guess? The game sort of ends normally, with no clear sense of danger or anything. The MC apparently works for some organization but that's never really touched upon either.

The story is a bit confusing and ultimately leaves you with more questions than answers (If you like that sort of thing then this is the novel for you). It doesn't help that instead of a steady flowing progression we get three different routes each unlocked after finishing the preceding route.The art is exceptional, the music is good and the girls and hideyoshi are interesting.Overall it's a short, fun experience that will probably leave you scratching your head but is well worth the read."

Warning: spoiler (!)To be fair this virtual novel is really good and have a particular plot which make this  novel unique even at some point i was literally trying to find what was going on in each route and what will the protagonist will do and also how the main protagonist will react. In my personal opinion ,for the story, the chap.3 is the best but sadly have a lack of romance compare to the others 2 chapiter.I know this VN do not necessarily focus on it but it kinda dissapointing to have some kind of dating between the protagonist and the character's route like on yuri's route and in Suzukake's route but almost nothing for Yae's one which is kinda sad.and for the 2 first chapiter was a real horror's playground which was great in my opinion because it  never had show anykind  of horror before the end of chapiter 1  and also the fact even the main menu changed into something very ''special'' i should say is pretty cool ! Also really like it how the game try to explain thing in a scientist way.The only cons for this game are probably the facts that this game is short, if you like to choose your route this game may make you dissapointed, if your into a romantic virtual novel this game probably (or not) made you think  you wasted your cash or if you hate science or any type of game which try to learn you something  it may possibly make your cringe or rage allitle inside.If  you hate cross-dresser in VN you should totally pass for this one.And Finally if you like classic VN and dislike complex plot and stuff you should also pass for this one.There are a lot of thing to talk about but i think i rode too much so i will stop  and rate this game 8.5/10 mostly good but have some problems to solve for next game or possibly( possibly not) an DLC ?! Who know !"

,Recommended,443330,23046021,"Posted: 17 May, 2016",all,Vampymonky,Overall: Very Enjoyable Game- Plot keeps you guessing and progressing out of curiosity- Great artisitc CG's with a good mix of story appropriate and minor sugguestive themes- Prefered Tokyo School Life's Multiple choice approach but wasn't a deal breaker- Main title theme is fantastically infectious!Overall looking forward to the next game to use the E-mote system!
