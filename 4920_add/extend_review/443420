76561198263427469,Recommended,443420,30880705,Posted: 1 April,all,Rurik,"A nice mix of genres.Artificical Defense is not just an ordinary TD game, because you spend only ~15% of total gaming time on postioning and upgrading towers. The game contains some RTS elements. You can place ""mines"" and increase you ""gold"" income defending ""harvesters"".You will spend the most of gaming time on aiming the enemies from the orbital. It' really cool. You have 3 different weapons: cannon (a couple of fast but weak shots with small area of effect), rocket launcher (average damage and average area) and bomb (one slow shot with huge damage and area). Every shot cost ""gold"". So you can't just shoot, because you will out of money soon. You must aim carefully. Every shot has delay before impact. If you kill some neutral enemies this will have bad consequences.I found this part of the game the most interesting.You have a main objective and 2 bonus objectives for every mission. If you complete them you get ""RAM"" in-game value. You can spend it on various upgrades for weapons and towers beetwen missions.I like the game setting. You are defensive program which proctects the computer. Actually, i can't undestand why the programm use Rockets and Bomb inside PC. It's nonsense. I would replace them with Anti-virus, Firewall, etc. It would perfectly fit.Anyway, i like how the game looks. UI design is undestanding. Effects are at the proper level.What i didn't like.- The first tutoring mission made me angry. You have to make exact actions but sometimes you don't undestand what you need to do. I wish developer improves it.- There is the same map for several campaign missions. Yeah, every mission has diffrenet objectives and enemies' waves every time . But i would like to see more maps in the game.- Music is good. But there is only 1 track for 1 chapter. It gets annoying very soon.- I would like to see more diversity in towers and enemies.Game is good (especially for one man made). Game is cheap.If you see this game on a sale , I recommend you to buy it. You will like it."

Maybe when you upgrade everything this game would be amazing, I just don't want to go through the grind and not enjoy it along the way( I'm ok with grinding when it's done right. Killing Floor, Payday)Upgrades cost is crazy for lvl 3, don't know beyond that, but bet it's higher. going from 4k to 32k and not having good enough weapons to beat later mission, meant that I would have to play the last level 32 times to get one new upgrade since my weapons sucked.My Score:DPrice:$1.75Main reason for dislike: too tedious with killing enemies given the weapons at handGames similar that are better:Creeper World 3Infested PlanetGemCraft"
,Recommended,443420,24723496,"Posted: 5 August, 2016",all,Torakusu,"First off, don't expect this to be your run-of-the-mill tower defense game.This game focuses heavily on resource management and plays more like a hybrid shooter/tower defense. The tower cost scales up quickly so you can only afford to place a few strategic ones to back you up. The rest you have to shoot down with projectiles/missiles/bombs manually, and every one of those costs resources. So this is not one of those place towers and watch things die TD games. It is more challenging than most TDs, but has an interesting balance. I found it to be quite enjoyable, though frustrating at times in a type II fun sort of way.The developer is very active. Just today I had an issue with the game, which I posted on the discussion board. Someone on the board picked up on it, notified me that the developer was offline at the time, that he has forwarded this to him. The issue was acknowledged, responded to on the board, solved, and patched within 24 hours of the issue being posted on the board. For an one-man-show developer, that is impressive.In short, if you're looking to try a new TD hybrid that is challenging, I would recommend giving this game a try. It's a fun indie game with a developer that I feel is worth supporting."
,Not Recommended,443420,26324338,"Posted: 30 October, 2016",all,Remco32,"I'm going to repeat most of whatthis reviewhas stated, since I wholeheartedly agree.I'm writing my own review, however, to bring down the ratio of positive to negative reviews, since I feel a bit deceived after buying a game that is apparently well received, but has some serious issues.This game tries to combine the genre of tower defense with some sort of top-down shooting and a tiny bit of RTS.The idea is nice, but it falls flat on it's face by how the game is balanced and tweaked.The gameplayYou have to defend your core structure from spawning enemies that simply will try to walk towards it. If an enemy touches your core, you lose your life. You win a stage by completing three objectives, which are in the vain of ""destroy 50 enemies"".The tower defense part consists of three types of towers. One passive resource gathering tower, and two offensive towers. The offensive towers are split up into a long range single-target tower and a short range splash damage tower.The top down shooter is the most engaging part of the gameplay. It allows you to shoot bullets and missiles from the sky that hit the ground after a delay. This makes timing your shots a crucial aspect.The final part is the extremely barebones RTS part. You gain resources that allow you to shoot (which requires ammunition) and buy towers. There are points on the map that you can take over with a special unit that allows you to get a resource bonus. These resources have to be safely transported though, akin to how harvesters worked in Command and Conquer.The problemsNow to the actual plaguing issue of the game.The tutorial gives you unlocked higher-tier weapons and tower upgrades to play with, but once you get to the actual game, you are left with peashooters. The game doesn't compensate for your lack of firepower in the first stages by giving you less enemies. You now have to deal with slowly moving hordes of enemies that you have to kill using weapons that reload slow and do little damage, and by using towers that also have to reload a long time between shots.I had to turn the difficulty to the lowest level to be able to survive any stage. Attempting or successfully finishing a stage rewards you with points that you can spend towards unlocking better weapons. Having some sort of fun seems to behind a grindwall.There are a handful of level packs (around 7 if I remember correctly). The levels contain multiple stages, with the only change between them being the objectives given. The layout is identical and so seem the timing of enemy spawns.In conclusionSo what you end up with is a neat idea packed into horrid balancing.It is genuinely impressive that this game was made by a single person, since it looks well, sounds nice and has a decent idea behind it. The author likes to really remind you of this fact, however. Showing it in the starting screen, in it's company name and in half of his posts on the game page.All that it needed was some playtesting and tweaking. But it seems like instead of publishing a good game the first time around, we live in a time where developers can just keep trying things with the thought of being able to patch anything in the back of their minds.I rather had waited and played this game in a more fun state, than the current product."
,Recommended,443420,23912308,"Posted: 28 June, 2016",all,Salvia Hardon,"My very first impression of Artificial Defense: the discussion forum. The developer is very active in the community and is highly receptive to feedback and actually gives a ♥♥♥♥ about the game. This deserves credit where it's due.And to expand on that original impression everything in the game is quite sleek and thematic. Nothing notable was left out in this regard that I could see.Contrary to my expectations, but not negatively impacting the results, Artificial Defense is 80-90% orbital shooter with minimal tower defense elements. This is mostly a comment there for people who really like tower defense and don't care for orbital shooter - look elsewhere.As kinda a mixed bag, I can tell that the optimal input device to play with is a controller with an analog stick. Using the mouse to aim was a bit unintuitive for me, but ultimately I figured it out okay. Using the keyboard to aim is possible, but based on splitting the shots of multi-round salvos effectively, I would highly recommend against it. I don't know if my initial struggles with keyboard/mouse controls are more a factor of myself or the game.And finally, the price is right. Especially if you're picking it up on sale like I did."

It takes a bit to get used to it, and there are certainly features that I haven't always understood, but as a whole, I've been quite pleased with it. It makes you really think about what is most important for you to be doing at any one time, Quite frankly, I think this game is under sold, it's worth more than it currently is listed.If this game lacks anything, it's not always intuitive what new things can do. For instance, I didn't know until quite recently that certain bombs have effects that last long after the weapon has been deployed. Still, finding those things out is a part of the fun of the game, and with the variety of missions, I eventually was forced to learn these new features, always keeping me on my toes. Overall this was an awesome game!"

If you're looking for a mindless tower defense game, I'd probably look elsewhere. You'll be constantly shooting creeps, building towers, and capturing obejectives.The concepts in the game make it easy to learn, but the levels quickly become challenging.

The orbital shooter part is the main mechanic and leading the target is the main skill you need. The Tower defense and RTS mechanics play more supporting roles, at least in the early stages of the game - maybe this changes later on. It is quite difficult, but I don't think the balance is off as other reviews have claimed - its just not the sort of game where you can necessarily expect to beat every level first time."

The plot is simplicity in itself, simply defend a computer against corruption.  Sounds easy, but it's really not.  Towers get more expensive each time you place one, and even those can't kill everything.  You'll find yourself screaming at the computer at times, but I personally think that's good.

,Recommended,443420,30372849,Posted: 7 March,all,Hexie Lambent,"This is definitely a labor of love, with the upsides and downsides that go along with it.  As is made very clear (perhaps too many times) it's developed by one person, and parts of the game do feel like ""it's my game so I can do what I want with it"".  Call it a hunch.Some of those things being that I have to -earn- basic functionality like speeding up the game and zooming into the battlefield via certain upgrades to my ""hard drive"".  It sounds cute, but... seriously?  The introduction was very shaky and almost off-putting, with it just giving you lines and lines of text, complex UI and hotkeys, and indicators to click this-now do that-now click here, and go through the motions just so you've done them, like a cheap mobile app.  Something like slowly introducing mechanics bit by bit in the first moments of a level would fit this much better, not literal youtube videos comprised of (assumedly) the developer playing and commentating the intros.  Which, by the way, you can speed up and zoom in in the tutorial, then it's taken away for reasons.It took what felt like 30-45 minutes to really adapt to the game and its interface and understanding all of the mechanics, which in reality are really simple, but they're explained so abruptly it's hard to take it all in.  When I finally felt comfortable actually playing the damn thing, soon enough it already felt kind of shallow, slow, and babying, with these extremely simple first levels, and the notion that the entire rest of the game isn't going to get much more intricate.  Another hunch is that he thought the UI and controls were so alien that he wanted the most absolute tender beginning to not scare people away.So, a quick recap - the introduction and general pacing is a mess, the game feels shallow, and your linear upgrades are locked behind exponentially more expensive upgrades which just take playtime.  Thing is, there's upsides to the ""labor of love""-ness.Once you sort of abandon your own pre-existing notions and instead walk in the developer's shoes in such a game like this, you start to see some of the design decisions.  Things start to click, to flow together, and fall in place, and while I'm still not really sure it's much deeper than I'm imagining, it feels a lot more entertaining to play - especially if my hopes for what is in store fall into place.  The abstract keybindings feel less strange, the global aiming and prediction... could still use a re-imagining but it's less terrible after a bit, the usage of weapons and towers become more clear, that kind of thing.The music and the aesthetic are about the only charismatic things in this game, which I guess in my case were enough to keep me invested until I figured the rest of the project out.  The presentation as a whole is very inviting.  The inoffensive and energetic EDM, the shading, colors, and menus, the minor voice overs, the animations of pretty much everthing fits nice and looks nice, the clean UI, and so on.Bottom line:  it's very alien, but it's interesting and filled with heart and effort.  I realize this is as much ""review"" as it is just my thoughts on it as a project."

Genuinely, if you have a issue - you can contact him and he'll help you none-stop until the issue is fixed. He'll go out of his way for you, if that doesn't have you sold, read on!First off, the game is very unique in the way it works. From how you gather points to update things, to how you kill the enemies. The thought of a top-down shooter mixed with Tower-Defence and a tiny hint of RTS is a amazing idea and I'm excited to see more of the developers games.The developers attempts at a mixture of visual styles; ranging from some cell-shaded, to the clear abstract style definately gives the game a very unique look; the geometric enemies make it very easy for the player to see where they're heading and is definately a positive for the game.Furthermore, the unique sense that the game goes for somehow helps you get immersed in the game. The attempt at a story is room for huge props considering the game could have easily went without any explaination at all - you're just there to kill stuff and that's it. No; the developer is clearly dedicated and for the things that he does, deserves far more than just £3.99. At such a modest price - how could you not buy the game?TL;DR:The game is good, buy it."

You have to both mange your resources which function in the form of RAM or (Random access memory) and use it wisley to invest in towers to defend your operating system or (OS). Here is the twist you use ram when you fire from an ac 130 like perspective using machine guns missels and nukes and while you place towers so accuracy with your shots and resource management are a very large part of the game. However there are ways to increase your excess ram both through destroying cookies and by entering conquer mode and taking over system structures which have a few diffrent effects such as generating diffrent resources.
