Reminded me of the XKCD interactives, especially Time:  (nearly) monochromatic graphics and exploring on a line without knowing what to expect. Not planning to replay, even though I seem to have missed the last achievement, but if somehow something else from these developers came along, I'd take a look."

,Recommended,443580,29414664,Posted: 21 January,all,☢» MACHIN3 «☢,Another free game with easy achievments (using the guides available)... If your an achievment hunter then this is another game to add to your perfect game collection! Gameplay itself is very basic and only about 20-30 mins total if going for the achievments.
,Not Recommended,443580,30181474,Posted: 25 February,all,Sadie,"Interesting concept, disappointing execution. I love this kind of short, introspective game, but this one pales in comparison to some of the others out there. The radio mechanic is cool, but we're able to use it just twice, and the rest of the experience doesn't engage the player. There was atmosphere, but it was minimal (in feeling, not just design), and the fact that every action the player takes must be directed with on-screen cues reflect the fact that without them, this game wouldn't make sense - it's just not intuitive.If you'd like an atmospheric, visually and mechanically interesting game, play The Old Tree. It's meditative, reflective, and beautiful."

When that happens you procede to find one of the worst designed puzzles I have yet to complete, despite learning the awnser from google. Also to add salt to this wound it is slightly different for every person AND it makes you wait inbetween what you need to be doing. I have also heard bad things about the next puzzle so for that reason alone I can not reccomend this game. It isnt a puzzle when the only way to get an awnser appears to be trial and error."

,Not Recommended,443580,29568247,Posted: 29 January,all,♰Noxah✨Nukem♰,To be able to even finish this game you need a walktrough on it unfortonately because it's hard to understand the puzzles and what to do at some moments. The only + is the good artwork.

,Not Recommended,443580,30092022,Posted: 21 February,all,galahadhk,"It's funny to see the kiddies who know nothing about life trying to figure this game out as if it had some deeper or complex meaning. I wish I still had that imagination. Maybe I should make a game like that. Just leave everything out intentionally out and watch them go crazy.Seriously though, this is a waste of time. The experience and ""ending"" will leave you exactly as the game portraits itself: Meaningless and empty inside."

I wasn't going to recommend it, but it's better than all the movies, visual novels and p2p facebook games, so what the heck. And it's free. Artwork, atmosphere and sound are actually nice, it's just not a game. Knock yourself out."
,Recommended,443580,29705737,Posted: 4 February,all,lSkeletonWitchl,The game was free and took about 20 minutes to beat. Love the art style of the game but not sure if there is a meaning behind the game.

The puzzles give you just enough direction to let you figure out on your own what you need to do, which is something I've felt is lacking in a lot of puzzles lately. It walks a fine line between too little instruction and just enough, which I honestly adore.The puzzles require patience and force you to find solutions one baby step at a time; it DOES feel like you're just a little robot exploring and trying its hardest.Maybe a ten minute playthrough once you know what you're doing? Fun. I'd love to see more levels and/or more games like this from the designer(s)."

76561198137572904,Recommended,443580,30024127,Posted: 18 February,all,Doehg,This game is quite good.Pros:-Fast to download-Free-Nice bit of fun-Not too long-Not too short-Free-Pretty interesting puzzles-The Puzzles make sense-The Puzzles are easy-Everything is coolCons:-It is pretty short-the animations dont have enough frames-the robot legs stay up when stopped-you can't jumpReccomended for when you need to wait for another game to downlaod.Conspiracy theory:Getting a better signal in-game will Increase connection signal out of game and dowload that game you're waiting for faster.
