But I only managed 2 hours... and as explained later this was only because I was forced to restart the game from the beginning due to a bug.I liked the visual style of the game, just not anything else about how it was implemented such as the weird walking animation of Soul for example. The game didn't really give me the comic feel I was expecting and at most times the game seemed very condescending with how it blatently tells you ""LIKE"" ""LOVE"" ""HATE"" and all that. I also just couldn't like any of the characters, they just weren't likeable.I played for a bit, got stuck for half hour trying to find clotted cream, then gave up and searched youtube where they somehow had clotted cream in their inventory without showing me how they got it, so I searched again and it seems I actually hit a bug where if you don't collect the clotted cream and leave the screen it's gone forever.Despite this I started the game again because I had no saves at that point, collected the cream this time, got merely 5 minutes further and hit another game breaking bug after following a book into what looked like a graveyard at he bottom left of the first area, I got stuck outside of the screen before even entering the gate and gave up.So in the end I was going to get a refund but didn't, as I want the creators to try harder to fix the bugs and try again in future, but I think they have the aility to come up with good things."

The whole story of the game seemed kinda campy, much like a Scoby-Doo cartoon but it redeems itself with interesting gameplay, narratives and amusing characters. I would love to see an option to lower some graphic-intensive addons seeing as my laptop drudged along through the beginning portion, but instead of going for a refund I let it go. The game plays smoothly enough once my crappy laptop made it through and I love the musical possessions!Again, a really good game and I highly recommend it!"

The storyline is fun, the music is pretty awesome.  If you enjoy point and click adventures with a sense of humor, than this is for you.  The art is also pretty wonderful."
76561197998835820,Recommended,443650,22818488,"Posted: 5 May, 2016",all,Theokid,"A fun, bizarre, puzzle adventure game.The best way I can describe it is CAMPY.  Like a B horror flick this game is full of bugs, missing odd pieces of voiced dialogue, limited voice actors and subpar recording, goofy glitchy visuals, and some corny music.But for all that the games just bursting with heart. All the problems above almost add to the ambiance and sense of the game. The characters and world is bursting with color, amazing detailed enviroments, and while some of the music is silly and repetitive, the main hits in the game are really catchy. The game also features beautiful comic styled cutscenes that all really fit the vibe of the city.Some of the puzzle aspects are somewhat vague, and if you miss something small you may be stuck for a little while, but overall the game does a good job of guiding you between objectives. The possesion mechanic is great albiet a little confusing at times when trying to solve puzzles that require specific characters.So while this game is definitely unpolished and rough, it manages to do well with what it has, and over all a very enjoyable experience.  One has to wonder if the developers had the means to really polish this game what it may have been, and if maybe it's almost better this way..."

Lots of catchy tunes and an endearing story line that will keep you hooked from the start. Not to mention it has a really cool art style that makes the whole game a treat on the eyes. Definitely worth picking up if adventure games are your thing, or even as a first try with the genre."

So, with that being said, I would DEFINITELY have to recommend this game based on its interesting storyline, extremely awesome soundtrack, and the art style! I enjoyed a lot of the different aspects of the different characters that you had to use throughout the game. That being said, this game did have bugs, and I did have to restart the game once to fix one of these bugs! Despite this, I would still reccommend the game to anyone who wants to play a game with a truly unique story and characters!"

There were some good music references and fun with the names of characters. I liked the overall look of the game, and the concept was interesting. Where I felt the gameplay was let down a little was the repetativeness of certain elements.There appeared to be two Acts to the game and I liked the idea of splitting these, as Act 2 felt like a new part to the game. But I felt there should have been a final Act 3, maybe with a little more to do with finding 'the body.' Which seemed to become a little redundant towards the end of the game.The music was very original, and fair play to the writers and voice actors used. But the same music playing over and over did get quite tedious after a while. Especially when I found myself waking up in the morning and the 'Betty the Banshee' one line on repeat in my head. I maybe should have looked to see whether there was an option to turn off the music within the game. Also I found the length in which it took to switch characters during the game started to annoy me a little. Especially when you had to listen to the whole of the song each time. Lola's loves and hates are now etched into my brain.Unfortunately this wasn't a game I really loved. It had its moments and some fun elements, but I found the gameplay repatative, especially towards the end and the final part of it quite a let down. I would still recommend this for the price and it's original content. Just I honestly have to say for me I would have liked a little more variety and some more streamlined elements."

Having said that I found this game to be quite refreshing.Art is fantastic.Music is Awesome.And the artistic/comic book feeling is definitely a fun change from all usually games you play now days.Highly reccomend for anyone looking for something new.
,Recommended,443650,24360445,"Posted: 16 July, 2016",all,Good Guy,"It's fun, unique, riddled with bugs and inept implementation of nice ideas.Some game design aspects are very quartionable. For instance, your ""soul"" can switch between several characters in game. But to do so, you have to travel to the location of that charater, which takes time. It's absolutely not neccesary and becomes tiring when you have to switch between 4 characters.Music is great, art is great and for that I can forgive ♥♥♥♥♥♥ programmers job and even more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sound engineer job."

As of right now, it's much too buggy. I've been sent outside of the map several times, and some times, it can ruin any progression you've made thus far. I'll have to check back in later to see if these glitches have been patched.Edit: Turns out whatever was wrong with my game, had to do with my FPS. Even though I had a problem, I don't want it to turn anybody off from this game. If you're half interested, just buy it. It's a super fun and entertaining, and the developers seem super cool and on top of things!"

Because it is EXTREMELY technically incompetent and primitive with TRULY UGLY control scheme for keyboard, to the point that it is ridiculous. Also, it has bugs, one of which prevents me to even continue. All in all I won't recommend it, even though the idea is cool and music is also not bad, but the final game they made is simply not good at all, with poor technical qualities and amateur voice acting. Sad :("

(I used a MacBook Air to play it if that makes a difference in this case.)I would not recommend this game."

I can't even get out of the first room because the controls are buggered up for me. I press or hold Y to get my inventory open... nothing happens, B, nothing happens.. I haven't been able to find anything on this and I really hate to give it a negative review but as you can see from my play time, it's been over an hour of trying to get this to let me out the room and I just can't get things to work right.Edit: Now I've tried using my keyboard and I even tried to remap and I just can't open up my inventory at all. What gives?"
