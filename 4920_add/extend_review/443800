How there used to be a thing called local multiplayer, so very long ago? This game revives that forgotten relic in the most beautiful, modern way possible. I shouldn't even need to write a review. Do you like video games? Have you and your friends ever had fun? If so, buy Ruckus Ridge.Ruckus Ridge is similar to the old Mario Party games, in that you have varying mini games with different objectives. Collect the most coins, blow up your fellow couch player, get to the VR player in the middle, etc. The VR twist makes this very fresh and exciting however. You'll hunt and be hunted. You'll talk smack on your deafened friend, and shout profanities at anyone around you while cut off from the outside world. And ultimately, you'll have fun.So get this game. Unless you don't have any friends, in which case you should handle that first."

It isn't perfect but it's goddamn good and the combination of hilarity, great presentation (the announcer is hilarious), and asymmetric play with the couch users is goddamn great.The best part about it though? The HMD is a hot seat. Every player gets one chance in the HMD, and it makes sure everyone gets a brief, hilarious, and engaging time. If you have friends, and you're looking for a good time, grab this game up quick. So far the biggest surprise that has come out of my Vive for me.Here's a clip of the hilarity we all experienced:https://youtu.be/CpboeL7EVlU"

We ended up just letting a player play in the Vive for a few rounds and just ignoring the score totals.- Free play: return to the game selection screen after a game instead of back to the main menu. (Hopefully we didn't just press the wrong button.)- Support more players? Though I can understand it would make balancing the difficulty for VR player vs regular players harder. Maybe if more players could be added, but only 4 play at a time? Oh well, 4 was fine too, we just switched around the players after a full game.- More stage types!Anyways great job on this game, hope you'll keep working on it or make more similar games in the future."

Or something...awkward to explain to family in other room.Cons:-Seems like the whole game was thrown together, could be attributed to the developers not being American/English-Not too many maps/game modes-I wish there were more customizable optionsI do recommend purchasing the game if you have a group of 3-4 friends coming over."

Lots of things done right ! and simple, no-frills (very) asymmetrical- local multiplayer.With 3 buddies vs Vive it's hillarious obnoxious local deathmatch fun for 4. On the other hand,  the few times we tried Vive vs 1 -2 . . . not so much. Even a tipsy headset player can stomp two helpless box dwellers like the trash they are... trying to snatch all my coins... I see the slightest movement and I got enough nails for the both of ya coffins!BIG kudos for their joystick support GOOD DEVS ! Even my hotas flightstick functioned as a controller!) didn't even need their (free) wifi andriod app.Game consist of just a few(4?) simple environments randomly paired with one of a few classic game objective for the 2D players:Collect coinsFlip the most territoryGet rid of the bombFind the hidden gemsInfiltrate the VR baseDay or Night, the Vive user does one thing - stand in the middle and shoot the 2D's.Simple, but clever design leads to enough variety for an hour of entertainment.I'd suppport a sequel that expanded on the core asymetrical gameplay with a couple more novel modes, interactions, and environments. I believe these devs have some potential, let's see if this was more than just a flash in the pan."

The idea is really good and i'd love to see more games like this one, but me and my friends lost interest in this one too fast because of lack of game modes and lack of variation between the few modes there are. Also the game would benifit from longer rounds, since the vive headset is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to switch around every 2 minutes when different people have different head sizes."

Alot of people seem to really enjoy it and that's fine, but for the most part this feels like unfinished shovelware. There is no reason for this to be a 10 dollar product. as you can see from the play time it didn't even hold our attention for an hour. Can't really suggest any one but this as it stands now."
76561197990270671,Recommended,443800,24963695,"Posted: 16 August, 2016",all,flibbertigibbety,"Now, I've always shown off my Vive at parties, but it's usually someone trying it, while others sorta wait around and just lose interest. No one wants to look at a monitor to see what someone is seeing.So, I just had a party, and wanted to finally give Ruckus Ridge a go. This totally changes things! Basically, the Vive player in in the middle of the level, and the 3 other players play on the monitor of the same computer controlling their characters from a top down view with controllers (I use wireless xbox 360 controllers). The game is certainly simple enough for anyone to grab a controller and jump right in. The Vive gameplay is also simple but rewarding. People really were digging the idea of playing against a player that's IN the game... and when people get a chance to use the headset, they also get a good understanding of what the Viver is seeing when they switch back to the controllers. Everyone gets a turn with the headset throughout the tournament, so no one is left out, and everyone playing participates at all times. It works better than I could have imagined.The game has 6 game modes for 4 players, and all feel a bit different. I feel like they could certainly add more to the game, but for what's available for $20, I think you get a good amount of fantastic local multiplayer amusement.Also keep in mind that as of the time I write this review, this is the ONLY game for the Vive that supports 4 local palyers. If you have friends over or want to play with family without everyone sitting around waiting for their turn, this game should absolutely be on your list."
,Not Recommended,443800,29792444,Posted: 8 February,all,Vengeancegoon,"As the game currently stands, I wouldn't recommend it. It's not a bad game, it's just not a very good game either.The initial concept I like, 3v1 with one player in VR and the others using controllers. Has the beginnings of a fun party game, and if this was early access, but this is a finished game.The devs had some good ideas that are for the most part executed well just no real variety. It's a shame because this could be a really fun game. If it's every free or cheap enough then check it out, but go in with low expectations or you will be disappointed."

It reminds me of the asymmetrical WiiU mario party but with only one mini game :(  I'm sure there are alot of fun, quick, quicky asym mini games to be had here.Anyway, I recommend this title with the hopes that they add to it!There aren't many VR games that can be played with friends locally. I recommend purchasing extra cushions and let your friends each have their own (this game has you switching the headset)... unless, that is, you like wiping your friends sweat all over your face, lol.Also - love the iphone controller support."

This is the same mini game over and over again with slight differences in the backdrop. It was boring within 10 minutes. And why on earth does it say ""Hold A button to start"" when I am in the HMD? There is no A button on the Vive controllers. That just seems lazy. And no matter which option I select for amount of turns in the HMD, it changes after every round. Super buggy this game is."

Ruckus Ridge proved me wrong and ended up being a much better experience that I had anticipated. My friends and I played for 2 hours straight, the whole time laughing our asses off.Each level has it's own twist to it with the objective, but basically having the controller-players pit against each other to complete an objective all while trying to avoid being killed by the one on the Vive. After each level, the Vive get's passed to a randomly selected controller player and the two switch.If you don't have controllers, but have a smart phone then you're in luck! They have a smart phone app that allows you to use your phone as a controller!It's a simple ""party game"" concept that is executed very well and contains hours of fun, friendly, competition amongst your friends.TL;DR If you have friends and a Vive, then you need this game."
