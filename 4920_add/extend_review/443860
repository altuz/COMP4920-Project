Add some SSX flare.You get a crazy feeling of adrenaline and speed when you are chasing after the wake of the person ahead of you, so you can slingshot passed.If you already own Riptide GP 1 and GP2, there is plenty of enough reason to get Renegade.  More stunts.  I think it's FASTER.  More ALIVE.  And Deadlier.The 9 tracks are insane with so much going on.  (It's leaning more toward VectorUnit's action packed blockbuster racetracks of Hydro Thunder Hurricane.)It's gorgeous.  Lush and futuristic.  Apocalyptic in others.  There is one track that is in a storm and the waves are massive.The sound FX are amazing!As I'm skimming along the water on a crotch rocket, I keep saying to myself over n over, ""This is amazing.""Controller..   get one.  It's a racing game.  lol  The only people complaining about the game are the people who REFUSE to buy a controller.  For $13 it's a damn steal.THANK YOU VECTOR UNIT for this GEM.Now I hope to see you people online during peak hours.  (3PM to 9PM)  And I hope your ride is souped up, cause you will get DUSTED...  in the WATER, where dust doesn't even exist!!"

If you liked the last game you will like this one. There are a few changes but all in all it is more of the same in the best way possible. This is a very fun arcade racer. Don't buy it expecting realistic physics or a deep role playing experience. Expect fun, well thought out tracks and some really ""wow"" moments with much improved graphics."

I like to get my money's worth. I like knowing when I pay for a game, it is playable, it is fun to play and I wont just play it 1 time and never look at it again. This game is worth the $15 or whatever it is. No buyer's remorse.

,Recommended,443860,24564356,"Posted: 27 July, 2016",all,Chill,"Best described as a mix between Hydro Thunder and Wave Race 64 (as far as stunts are concerned, anyhow), Riptide GP: Renegade has a fairly long single player mode that includes a mix of race events, stunt contests, time trials, and elimination events, in addition to 8 player online events and 4 player splitscreen modes.There's also an excuse plot that serves as a way to explain how you end up unlocking new characters and vehicles (there's 9 characters and 9 vehicles total), and why you'll have to deal with police hydrojets (their term for the boat/bike things, not mine) chasing you every now and then.The only drawbacks I can think of at the moment is that the AI can be a tad ruthless at times, the music is fairly bland, and that playing with a gamepad is essential (although this goes for just about every racing game). Overall, if you enjoyed any of the previous games in the series, or any other arcade racing game involving boats, Riptide GP: Renegade is well worth its low asking price."

The sense of speed, kicking soundtrack, sheer number of tracks and upgrades will keep you coming back for a long time. As a casual gamer who grew up in the arcade, this is a nice walk down memory lane. Considering its only a half of a CD worth of information, goes to show how there is so much bloatware out there. This is a lean mean racing game with amazing use of water and particle physics. I assume this is an android port, but actually feels like an XBox360 game. On a side note, depending on what controller you are using or keyboard and mouse, the game automatically senses it and started telling you to press <enter> or <A button>, very nice touch, theres nothing as annoying to me the game telling me to press <enter> when I'm using a controller or vice versa. Kudos to Vector Unit! Also it supports ultrawide, huge plus for people like me."

Nicer graphics, some shortcut routes and some more gameplay options.My main issue is lack of tracks, from what I saw and researched its only has 9 tracks with a few variations. Like Ride the motorcycle game, its good, but gets old racing the similar tracks with just a few small changes to the tracks and type of race (race, stunt points, elimination). It does have different event variations to keep it fresh. GP2 was better with tracks imo.Its has more of a sci-fi theme and is a nice arcade racer that focuses on stunts and boosts, same controls for stunts which are critical to winning, upgrades (a bit of grinding) and some vehicle customization options. Wish you didn't need to use the boost up all at once. Anyways, the price is reasonable, so I say its a buy if you want some fun Jetmoto style of racing.8/10"

It's mobile roots were evident in the first two games, but Renegade builds on what made the last two so great, and goes all out.Controls are perfect now. Not a single flaw. The Hydrojets are more nuanced, and the trick system is more forgiving, in the best way possible. You still need to know what kind of tricks to pull out and when, but landing them is a lot easier now - making them even more essential to racing.Graphics are great. Very pretty and colourful. It may lack some of the fancier effects of other modern racers, but for this kind of flawless performance, I'm more than willing to give up some mod-cons.Sound is as you'd expect from a Riptide game. Great music, satisfying effects, it all just screams pure 'arcade'.The fleshed out single player is great, a big improvement over GP 2. The storyline is ok for what it is, nothing special. But you don't play games like Riptide for the story.The only problem I have is that the game at certain points gimps you on purpose, to make the game harder. I've spent a fair amount of time grinding races for money - I don't really appreciate you giving me races where my hard earned upgrades don't count, with the time I'm putting in to make sure I CAN give myself an advantage over the competition. It smacks of unfair. I'm more than willing to grind racers to afford the upgrades I want, so don't punish me, the player, for playing, basically. It's not a dealbreaker (yet), so I'll let it slide for now.Everything else though is golden. I'm having so much fun just playing. The variety is there, the audio/visual presentation is excellent, and the controls are SUBLIME.Absolutely recommended."

,Not Recommended,443860,31774413,Posted: 15 May,all,Blunder Sunder,"I'd had this on my Wishlist for a while after looking for something to scratch that Waverace 64 itch, finally picked it up and ultimately I'm quite dissapointed. I'm a big racing game fan, and I'm pretty forgiving in the genre, but this fell totally flat for me.The environments and visuals are stunning, and there are a good number of them. This aspect of the game deserves praise.However the racing I found incredibly dull - right from the get-go. Immediately bored. I think it's a combination of factors to be honest, but I didn't find it challenging or exciting, it really lacks something - the stunts were more like quick time actions, and the general experience was more like being on a theme park. I tried out all the tracks available to me and they all felt more like dioramas than tracks - beautiful but I'm just kind of going round like I'm on a wobbly log flume. Ultimately I can't recommend a racing game I don't enjoy racing in, and this is one of the few I've experienced.And we need to talk about the water - because great water physics combined with clever track design could have redeemed things. Falling from a height is a very odd sensation, the water is clearly some kind of non-newtonian fluid - that all-important satisfying dip into the water simply isn't there. I'd have avoided drops altogether with the physics as they are, personally. The fact that there are 'slopes' of water, but no water movement is also bothersome, you're never contending with a current. Worse still there are corners with *banked* water - creatve license taken a little too far there I think - it's starting to look like you didn't really want to make a jetski game...Dissapointing! But it seems a lot of the other reviewers enjoyed it, so it might depend on what you're after."

And it's bloody fantastic.Pricing is on point, bunch of content to be enjoyed here and a decent variation of different customizable vehicles and riders. The difficulty here is also hard as balls,so DO EXPECT SOME CHALLENGE with this one.Mechanics are also pretty smooth and very simple, there aren't many buttonsto be pressing so you'll definitely get the hang of the control scheme real quick.Visually, it looks amazing.The aesthetic isn't exactly unique or anything we've not seen before but it just looks GREAT.The characters, colours, backgrounds, maps, WATER, it all looks amazing.Especially for something that started off as a mobile title.You can do tricks with your water ride thingies but overallit's a pretty casual racing game that really reminds me of the SSX series.As you know none of those made it to PC or STEAMso if you're looking for something of that nature, this is definitely the game to be picking up."

,Recommended,443860,24684184,"Posted: 2 August, 2016",all,Keithster™,"At first launch, it seems a bit like a buggy port from a console or phone/tablet. The tutorial starts by saying that you need to chase another racer, and that it will auto accelerate. Cue me sitting there waiting for it to start moving. Turns out, auto accelerate is disabled by default. Cue me trying to press W to get the jetski to move. No effect. Space. No effect. Up arrow. *Starts moving*. Groan - bad default keyboard map. Changing the keys is a harrowing experience too - reminds me of some dodgy old games circa 1995. And you can't use the mouse to move the viewport or boost either - strictly a keyboard affair and the automatic camera mode. Plus, until you restart the race, it gives the wrong hints for what keys to press... It even suggested that I ""tilt my device"" to turn at one point - er, pretty sure there is no accelerometer in any part of my computer...I've played the previous Riptide games, so I figure I can try boosting and doing tricks in the tutorial - no go. Turns out they don't become active until you start playing for real, at which point you kinda get infotips showing you how to use them anyway... So, my advice is just skip the tutorial completely. Whether or not you have played the previous games, you are not missing anything except a bit of story...Apart from that, graphics are pretty gorgeous, race tracks have hints about turns and stunt areas, at least to start with (I haven't seen an option to turn them off for a more authentic experience - I do know how to look at the mini-map, you know!). Will play some more and see how it goes..."

However, I still mantaining my initial observations about it. The difference is that I would recommend it now instead.The game has all the annoyances of previous titles in the series, without having any of the fun things that made those previous games enjoyable. It's still a game about grinding so that you can buy a bike and upgrade it, but now the bike gets nerfed down when entering races bellow the stage in which you acquired that bike. What the actual f$%k were these people thinking! However, there are plenty of events to keep you ocupied, that will tend to put you on the same tracks over and over again.The color palette on some races is super crappy, so you will find yourself racing in cities where the water is grey, the buildings are grey, the sky is grey, and the obstacles that knock you down from your bike are ALSO grey. There are three difficulties in the game, easy, medium, and hard. Hard is unbeatable, and the other two make you feel unaccomplished, effectively making the game pointless.I don't think I have ever been so angry with a game, and to further exacerbate this, I was (still am) totally hooked with GP2. Riptide GP2, this game's predecessor is a much more simple game, but orders of magnitude more fun to play.  I still believe that most of the flaws in this game can be corrected with a simple patch though. So there is hope for this game still.The bikes are the coolest of all of the series, lookwise that is. And some minor story elements have been added to the game, so now you gain riders as well as bikes as you progress, each coming with their own mini story arcs that leads to exclusive races, open only to those riders. This would have been amazing if they would have put a little bit more effort into the monologs of these characters, as well as their stories in general. But the stories are so dumb, and the riders are so poorly writen, that you can't really appreciate any of them. Awesome idea, just poorly executed.The game's still somehow fun to play, although not worth obsessing over with."

It rewards you for skill and quick thinking in an otherwise difficult game.If you've enjoyed previous games in the series, or even other water racers from the past, don't hesitate to give this game a shot."

But i feel like there is a market for them, espesically now in the summer time. Its a refreshing game that you feel good about playing when you come home from playing in the sun or if working under a roof, its very nostaglic if your from my time (93-now). But even so the racing makes you feel like there is in RNG with the water textures. It makes it unpredictible and a different feel to the customary ""street racing game"".Riptide GP2 was great. I never played the first one (i think it was only available for mobilie) but with the second it felt like I was put in a plastic fake jet ski in your local arcade shack. It brings back memories but also ignites a spark of inguenity to me that feels like we can do something great with water racing and bring it back. Not to go as far surpassind Gran Turismo but with the new ""Aqua Moto Racing"" realeased earlier this year we can evolve that and the sci fi feel of Riptide and come up with something great that can rival racing games like Burnout and Dirt."

It's an ok game, but if water is not your top priority, check Redout instead.The racing is cool so far, the boosting is faster than GP2 but the normal speeds are similar. The handling however feels much better.The transforming vehicles are very neat but in career and challenge mode not all are sidegrades, only the last half of the vehicles seem to be.In quick race, multiplayer and split screen you can pretty much choose any of the vehicles as their base stats are determined by the speed setting chosen beforehand.Where this one shines is in the track designs, it has all sorts of crazy post apocalyptic or utopian ones, there's also warzones and mid city tracks and even an amusement park. Some of the tracks change layout slightly from lap to lap due to scripted events, like doors opening, something blowing up or ""hacking"" the route.There's a story very similar to NFS:Most Wanted if you are into that.It's still a glorified mobile game."

The vehicles are more difficult to control, but I suspect with practice I'll get better.  What doesn't make sense is the other racers are insanely difficult to defeat and you can no longer buy new bikes! You have to defeat the insanely difficult opponents to get a new bike. It's impossible and not at all fun.  I even changed the level down to easy and they were still impossible to beat.  And it isn't like I suck at playing these games. I was quie good at Riptide GP. The newer surroundings are okay, I suppose, and the ""story"" is just sort of stupid. But the addition of police, I thought, would be welcome and might even be an equalizer in the game... except the cops only seem interested in you and no other racers. They seem to be there to get in your way (and ONLY your way) so you can't win. And that's it.  Considering the fun they could have had with adding police into the mix this seems like a huge opportunit missed. The devs took a very well balanced game (Riptide GP2) and made it practically impossible to play, and impossible to enjoy. I hope later updates fix these issues. At the very least, this game really needs to be balanced out."
