I recommend you do try the full free version if you are not sure (but please note, projects created in the 1.45 free version can't be imported into this version due to different handling of animations). Full games have already been made with earlier versions of this engine (for example Darksoul)Pros and ConsPRO:Visuals are stunning, true AAA quality3rd person or FPS characterOcean systems, weather and environmental controls are very impressivetime of day, day and night cycles with variable weather and affects can be implimentedA very clever visual scripting system (game engine) for AI etcPNG heightmaps are easy to importYour own 3d assets are fairly easy to importthe small number of included assets are very good quality.the price is a steal and the licensing terms could not be more generous: make what you want, sell your games,you'll owe the developer nothing.the developer engages well with the community, listenes to suggestions and helps with problemsprevious version of the same engine used to make Darksoul and other games.produces standalone games/applications at the click of a button which you can share/distribute freely.good physics Nvidia PhysXCONS:Early access, there are bugs, crashes and features not yet in the softwareLearning is required. Its not handed to you on a plate. Good tools are supplied, its up to you how you learn to use them. It will crash, it has bugs. It isn't perfect. It is a work in progress.lacks the easy plugins and templates of engines like unity or or unrealFPS issues for some users  -although it runs without issues on my modest system (i7, 16mb ram, 750ti)Currently 32bit/DirectX9limited number of included assets (but good quality)-----------------------------------------------------------------------comments:Maybe a possible alternative for you to CryEngine or Unity if you are starting from scratch and looking to the future a bit, If you are in it for the long haul you ought to have a good look at what this engine can offer, then have a bit of faith in how it will develop -  Its is undeniably a very impressive one-man creation.S2 doesn't hand everything to you on a plate with plugins and templates as yet, although DLC is available to make more of a game than a walking simulator now.   And it does have a clever visual AI scripting language, and a bunch of integrated tools to control animations, import models etc.Don't fall into the trap of thinking this is  ""press button X for the perfect game"" software. You will need to put hours into viewing the tutorials and reading the manual before you really get started.The developer has been working on S2 engine for around ten years before the Steam release of this new S2 engine-HD, so he isn't going to vanish overnight.It is very simple to grasp most of the basics although one or two things are frustrating (different) if you are used to other engines."

(have seen this problem before with other smalltime company engines).if and when the software goes 64bit and boosts its performance upto realistic levels of games making i may think about repurchase but for now im not risking going over the 2 hour limit for this product...thumbs down for now."

I’ve used Unreal Editor, Unity and cryengine. Out of those 3, I found Unreal Editor to be the best to use. Now S2ENGINE HD is easier than all of these in my opinion. The interface layout is easy to understand and the visual editor called GAME MACHINE is very straight forward. The script files that are created can easily be modified using notepad. One feature I do miss is building rooms. While other game engine uses subtractive method, this engine uses additive which is not a problem when you are constructing Open World type games. I would recommend this for the creative thinkers out there and the price is perfect for independent groups trying to create something wonderful to share without getting hit hard financially.Here is a sample of what I’ve designed so far with this engine.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=685300644"
,Recommended,443970,22540429,"Posted: 20 April, 2016",all,Deygus,"Simply Fantastic Indie Game Engine to play around with and learn to use which also has a good amount of excellent tools and graphics.It has a lot going on for it which may seem a bit uneasy to look upon at first but there's plenty of starter tutorials to get you going in the right direction.And as with anything there's a few obvious rough spots when running it that are bound to put some chinks in your armor when using it so as with anything it's not going to be 100% perfect mainly for being indie and a fairly new release.An example of such would be the free version from the website I downloaded initially to try before I buy which did not start up. Also, I've noticed several warnings appear in the console though most were from the fps example. And the S2Engine is a bit heavy on my cpu compared to Unity and UE4 since every time I run it my fan goes absolutely beserk until I exit the engine.Luckily though, the Debut dev has promised to fix it up as often as he can while adding in much needed improvements based on community feedback. So far he is also providing good forum support for potential problems or questions instead of ignoring them like other devs do which is  a plus in my book.So, other than those things above I've yet to experience any issues with this Steam Version of the S2Engine and it's going pretty well so far. I will be updating my review more in-depth once I'm further into development and understanding this engine a lot better.Aside from all that I consider it a must-have for any aspiring indie developer and it's worth every penny especially for what it can do!"

It is beyond fantastic although in the development phase. And believe me, I am not a new comer to game engines. My job, using Esperient Creator, is producing VR training simulations of electronic communications equipment and test equipment. I get paid big money to do it also... I have tried so many game engines, too many to be even named. Cryengine is my favorite commercial engine, which is now free to use, but has the royalties hanging over its head. When I look at S2 I see a Cryengine look-alike, especially with the real-time graphics when developing. The graphics are stunning! The look and feel is awesome to go along with it. These little people who write negative reviews are making fools out of themselves, most likely either competitors, children, or amateurs that are writing them. For the power you get with S2 compared to price, S2 has absolutely no competition! I am also a big fan of Axis Game Factory and Game Guru, where each one has its own purpose and useage, and all three with great pricing. For all who consider getting S2, do it! Never mind the morons who post negatives, they are wrong. The ones who complain about low FPS... BS... I have zero problems with the FPS, mine is very high. What do you expect when running such high end graphics on a pice of crap slow computer? What happens when you max our graphics on Cryengine, it runs SLOW, if YOU have a piece of garbage. So do NOT blame S2 for your slow piece of junk. I bet most complainers use a $100 to $300 video card? What do you expect, get a clue! I STRONGLY recommend S2, AGF, and Game Guru as your top 3 engines!!! For sure, you can NOT go wrong with S2!!!"

,Recommended,443970,24344644,"Posted: 15 July, 2016",all,Schuldt,S2 Engine has a great potential for creating games. While it's quite buggy currently there are steady updates adding fixes and unique features. Along with a lot of great built in features which saves a lot of time in the long run. There is a growing community making helpful videos and writings. This includes the developer Fabio with a dedicated channel which he puts lots of time into and even goes out of his way to make the videos English. With time I believe S2Engine will grow into a more commonly used program with some good dev teams to make some great games.Overall 9/10

Graphics are really good, The day, night, weather system (FX) is actually one of the best ones that I've seen compared to some major engines, but there are some major flaws in this engine. For example, I can't import height maps without the engine crashing on me. (There are many comments in the forums, and on YouTube telling the same story.) One REALLY good thing about this engine is; ""You will pay only once. No monthly subscriptions, No royalties after your game is published."""

Next I checked out the steam site to see what that was like, support through steam seemed to be quick and helpful. With all the multimediasites like Trello, Facebook etc. for this engine, there is no shortage of support. Quickly I purchased.The developer is always adding to the videos almost weekly, bug fixes and updates seem to be a priority and also updating the manual etc.With all the features this engine has at the price of a pizza, and the support, if you take the time to learn it you will have hours and hours of fun creating your dream worlds !My mom used to say I was all all thumbs.. well with the S2 HD Engine...They are all up, so hey, 10 thumbs up."

I would happily put this up there with the likes of Unreal Engine 4 and CryEngine. There is some teething problems but you get this with new software and it is expected.I think in a couple of months after the growing pains this is gonna be one heck of an engine!The developer is a great guy and takes on board any suggestions and the moderator and developer himself respond very quickly to problems on the Steam Discussions. The documentation needs a bit of work but in time I'm sure the developer will sort this along with video tutorials to learn this great software.Great performance on my rig, I have run in to some small minor issues but nothing that completely stops me from using the software. I highly recommend this to any hobbyist and even professional who is looking to get into the world of making games.EDIT: It's very annoying seeing people leave stupid nonsensical reviews, clearly people are expecting to use this out of the box and have a game ready but in the real world it doesn't work that way. Using any kind of software requires time to learn and master it and that applies here.Give this a chance and I am sure you will not be disappointed, sure there is some minor teething problems but that's expected in software and considering the developer is just one guy and has come this far its pretty impressive."

First and most important for me is Resolution Scale option. If your UI feels sloppy, frame rate is low during testing, use this feature and your headache will be gone in a second. If you don't know what is sucking memory in your game, there is an option to check that out as well which makes your debugging a lot easier and pleasant.I have a feeling that S2 is now a LOT stable then in previous versions, crashes that I've complain about in previous version are now gone.For $20 I really have to say that this is the best your money can get. Visuals are amazing in this engine, there is so much things to tweak to satisfy your taste and you are going to spend hours of experimenting with fx/post options and they are all looking great.As a someone who just dive in into 3D game making I can't recommend this engine enough.

So much needs to be upgraded on this engine and the developer should take a page from those other engines book's with the camera movement and ease of use."

This program is not as easy to learn so that I would recommend buying it. For other engines there is much content on the internet, and for this one there is one youtuber who doesn't explain anything well, in my oppinion, and has serious problems with speaking english, besides the manual - but what to do if something doesn't work? You can't find problem solutions online for an unpopular and non-professional software.Furthermore, it crashed twice every half hour I was using it, plus when I clicked somewhere I appearently should't have."

A potentially brilliant game maker missing some key elements, like  a manual that is complete, videos that are up to date, and some semblence of coherent editing layout.I purchased this once before, and found it to be buggy, and it crashed - a  lot! The new HD version is much more stable and workable, except the instructions are incomplete, the vids are old and show components and work throughs that no longer exist.On the positive side, this is awesome software developed by a single author who must be commended for the depth of  potential that is built into S2 HD. Perhaps he has taken on too much. After years of development it's hard to complete with the big boys - Unreal, Lumberjack, Unity etc. Yet I find S2 HD compelling to use as it has some assets, and makes waterfalls, roadways and has the best water I have ever seen. The frame rate and animation are good too on a decent PC.I would recommend this program for anyone who wants to be more 'hands on' than say GameGuru, yet doesn't need the power and investment of the bigger engines.I suggest that the author stop adding new features, and solidfy the current version with better documentation and tutorials."
