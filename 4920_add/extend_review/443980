,Not Recommended,443980,21331411,"Posted: 19 February, 2016",all,AssassinGlasgow,"If you look at the screenshots up there, that is pretty much what you get. They mixed SAO, Minecraft, and fanservice in order to attract the demographic of ecchi anime gamers. Sometimes it looks like they literally ripped Minecraft screenshots to put in the game.Art isn't bad, but is sometimes inconsistent since they use at least three artists and their styles are sometimes not consistent with each other. This is especially true in the colouring and shading. If you're bothered by this, it will probably throw you off, though I only saw it happen once in the time I played. Also, you are not going to see anybody with less than a DD bust in this game, unless it's literally the MC's mom. If you want variety, this isn't the place for you.There is nothing special about the story since it's just a vehicle to get you to the boobs. The writing is sometimes awkward, and there are more adjectives for things than you can shake your purple prose bible at. I will give them props for having some creativity with the world (literally called Burokku) though they mostly used Minecraft elements to justify it.I am not usually into ecchi, but I do like ecchi with good stories or comedic writing. In this case, this was just not for me. But if you're part of the aforementioned demographic and are OK with just going for the fanservice, give it a go.Edit: In case you guys want a preview of what the game looks like, I did a playthrough of the first half of the game.https://youtu.be/kJthKFXPPFA"

The art is generally nice, though inconsistent. Music is surprisingly pleasant. Story is generic and honestly kind of dull. Easily the biggest problem with this game is the pacing, which is incredibly, painfully slow. There is also no option to skip previously read text.If you are a die-hard fan of ecchi or girls with very large breasts, wait until the game goes on sale or is featured in a bundle. Otherwise don't bother, there really isn't anything else to see, and at full price even for a fan of this type of game I would not recommend dropping nine dollars on it."
,Recommended,443980,23617897,"Posted: 17 June, 2016",all,jiamdead,"Ok, let me make one thing clear. I know this game is targeted mainly at guys forobviousreasons, and thosereasonsat times do seem to have a major plot part to play, especially concerning one of the main characters. But even though the girls in this VN have such large assets, I don't feel it is done in bad taste. Even the artwork seems original and not some anime style clone. The VN story itself is short and light hearted, and was pretty fun to read. I did actually like the story and think it had a pretty decent plot that might've made a good Anime OVA like those from the late 90's with only 3~6 episodes. That being said, I wished the story could've been longer with more choices. If you're interested in purchasing, and the physical appearance of the girls isn't a turn off for you, pick it up on sale like I did, when it's around $4.99, or so. I think that's a better price point for a VN of this length with it's limited choices. Don't let my play time fool you. I read slow due to poor eyesight, and take lots of breaks while reading. My actual play time, going through both endings, might've really taken 3.5 ~ 4 hours."

And I mean…slooow. I’m not trying to be mean, but I actually fell asleep twice while playing this VN. The art style is nice (I believe there’s more than one artist involved, soNOT ALL sprites have the same quality… Some are good/decent and others are kind of awkward). BG was great, and BGM was really nice, although very short/limited.4/10, I gave one extra point because of the “bouncing” effect. That made me laugh so much, I think I cried a little. Get this VN on a good sale if you feel like playing a fan service game, since the full price is too expensive."

,Recommended,443980,21437525,"Posted: 24 February, 2016",all,"Communist ""Joseph Ballin"" Layton","Burokku Girls is the latest game from Silver Cow Studios, who previously developed Time Tenshi, another similar VN. This confuses me, since Time Tenshi's cliffhanger ending still hasn't been resolved with the sequel yet, but what can you do, right? If you haven't played Time Tenshi, the basic gist of these games is a focus on a deep ""plot"" and ""well-developed"" characters, by which I mean ""great big gazongas"". The actual storylines aren't bad, but at times they feel like more of a conveyor belt for floppy funbags, and it's safe to say that if you're not buying it for the sweater puppies you might want to look elsewhere. I didn't really like the story of Burokku Girls as much as I did Time Tenshi, but it was still decent outside of the occasional moment where it fell too deep into anime cliche. This game is notably darker than Time Tenshi, however, which might be off-putting for people just looking for a good wank. But the real question is, does it end on a cliffhanger like Time Tenshi? Well...[To be continued in the Burokku Girls 2 steam review]"

I do wish it was longer, but for the low price, I don't think it's too bad.  Overall, I had a good time with and I'm looking forward to more."
,Recommended,443980,21678265,"Posted: 6 March, 2016",all,onesubtractone,"Okay, The game play is standard Visual Novel. Couple of choices. Mostly cosmetic changes to the story. Nothing too exciting in that way.The story was actually a whole lot of fun. I enjoyed it immensely. I'd recommend it just for that.Be aware, Huge breasts abound. It's not required in any way for the story, but that barely matters. The artist likes huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥s. I'm not complaining. I like them as much as the next man.I appreciate the story, the art is good, the gameplay is just standard VN, my only issue is the episodic feel.I hate this whole Episodic story thing... I wish I could just buy a game and finish a game... I hate that I buy a game, Thinking I'm getting a full story, and then nope... Story just dies. Buy the next one!I will though. It was good. I will indeed buy the next one."

Your character will inadvertantly grope every single one at some point, or have his face mashed in the middle.  All the time.  At least twice per character.  There is some plot reason behind why they're so massive, but it's left down to maybe two lines and dropped for the rest of the game.The VN is very linear, with only two ""branches"" that I saw.  I'm sure the first one had no effect on the story, and the second just changes your ending.The writing itself isn't actually that bad.  They took a Minecraft-esque world and made it believable, with characters that live in it.  The MC gets an eleventh hour super power that is actually pretty cool and actually frightens half of the good guys that see him use it.The downside is actually what the developers focused on too heavily.  The sex appeal.  Yea, you're going to draw in crowds with it, but the Sakura series already took care of that.  Nobody really wants giant mammaries all over the place.  Had the chesticles not been such a focal point, with writer spending more time fleshing out plotlines than describing a pair of breats in two paragraphs, it would've turned out much better."
