The time limit. No matter if you pick course or stage, you have a time limit, and sadly theres no option for an endless mode where you can just race at your own pace to try to beat peoples times.2. The Spotlights. The night sections of some maps feature street lights, which completely obscure your vision.Ultimately, its a good game, for a good price at 5.99, but I really cant recommend it once its out of the sale period. Theres six courses, and thats it."

The graphics are simple, but still pleasing to the eye and support most modern resolutions. Music is good as well with a retro arcade style.To me the main attraction of the game is to play a classic Outrun style arcade game with cleaner more modern graphics and no messing with emulators and stuff.On the down side, the game is pretty bare bones. There aren't a ton of different modes or anything, just six locations arranged into different courses with time-of-day variations. Overall though, the classic arcade gameplay holds up just fine. It's a fun little time killer that I think is worth it for fans of Outrun/Hang-On style games (especially on sale)."

,Recommended,444000,24095914,"Posted: 4 July, 2016",all,Magnetto Man,"This game was tough for me to review. I have a personal reason for liking it , which makes my review biased. Thinking as a general Steam customer I would not recommend it for the full price and the way the game is right now. However , I am recommending this game for the following reasons:- *Personal Reason* : I played the original Outrun and Super Hang on. If you are a fan of these , than you should definitively get this game. You will probably feel like me: "" its good , but it could be great with a few improvements"" .- The content is short for the price, but what is there is good.- Devs have updated it after release. I tend to support every single game where the devs look hardworking and serious. I hope they keep improving this to the point anyone will be able to recommend!   ( I know, this should be only their obligation , but take a look around Steam and you will realize that unfortunately devs that update games have quickly become a huge plus ). Besides the updates up so far , to me there is a another solid evidence that this game is not intended to be a rip off or quick cash source that is soon abandoned after launch ( which is most of what you get in Steam lately unfortunately ) : the lack of trading cards.What can be improved:- More content: more courses , more game modes , different riders ( even if only skins with no different gameplay ) , more tunes ( the ones right now are good! But put a few more and it will be even better! ). Maybe add a few cars or new obstacles ?- Easier gameplay: a couple of bumps and you will run out of time. Since there are leaderboards for those who care to clear the courses with perfect performance, the time limit could be longer to make the game appealing and pleasant to a bigger amount of players."

You have 6 laps, and ca. 30 seconds time for each lap (crossing the finish line resets the counter). So you stay focused to get ahead and not bump into anyone, because obviously it slows you down. Doesn't sound challenging, but the road curves make it that more or less. Not the classical racing game, but kinda fun. The music and the road design remind a little bit of super nintendo's lamborghini, just with motorcycles, and well with different purpose."

So those add to the ""why I should've bought it to the full price"".The developers have updated this the last time on the 20th of June 2016, so I hope they will add more race tracks. How about a mountain race track, a beach race track, a village race track, a snow race track and other race tracks that are based on real locations and countries (like Hanami is clearly based on Japan)."

,Recommended,444000,21396103,"Posted: 22 February, 2016",all,Rhomega,"Super Night Riders is a good throwback to the days of Outrun and the like, where the key is completing the course within the time limit, rather than winning a race. Getting into the game is very simple. Just choose your course or race, pick which one you want, choose 1 of 4 songs for background music, and off you go. The first thing you'll wonder is ""What's the difference between courses and races?"" Each has 6 legs to complete.Courses change the environment after each leg (Forest, Desert, City, Canyon, Valley, and Hanami, which is essentially Japan in winter), while also changing the time of day (Day, Sunset, Dusk, Night, Dawn, Sunrise).Races take place in a single environment, with more emphasis on changing time.The real obstacles are other motorcyclists. They aren't competing, but bumping into them will hurt your time (protip: don't be afraid to let off the gas on turns). Once you complete each course or race, you'll be placed on the online leaderboards. I do have one complaint: street lights, while atmospheric, make it difficult to see other bikers, which makes City and Hanami at Dusk and Night a little unfair. It's all pretty simple, so get on out there!"

Very challenging and strict on race time, ranging from ""I just made it"" to ""I'm never going to make it!"" The game could use some added variety, like custom racer colors or additional race types.

But then I played it a little more, and it got me thinking.This game faithfully recreates the gameplay of 80s arcade racers with all the important details, but with more modern visuals. The visuals are not mind blowing, but they look pleasant and are not dull.The gameplay doesn't have a lot of variety, unfortunately, even compared to the 80s racers. There's only one vehicle you can choose, one type of ""enemies"", no unexpected nasties like an oil spill and such, and the track variety is pretty much limited to the visual theme. The tracks are handcrafted though and are nicely tuned in terms of the difficulty curve and the challenge.So the gameplay is pretty bare bones and is intentionally archaic, and the natural question arises: can the 80s racer gameplay be engaging/compelling in %the_current_year? I've never played these games at the arcades, but I have played this kind on an NES, and I did enjoy it. Granted, those were among my first ever games. Even the mere fact of me controlling pictures on the screen was exciting.I did enjoy playing this game, and a big part of it is nostalgia factor, but I have my reasons to believe that there's more than that. The design sensibilities of that era were defined by 2 factors: technology and the business model of the arcades. By the latter I mean those games were designed to get quarters out of people with the ruthlessness of a crack dealer. Those games were hard, because they didn't want you to get too much for your coin. That kind of difficulty is characterized today as ""punishing difficulty"" or ""NES-level difficulty"". But you also could always get better and beat the challenges you couldn't before. Those games wanted you to get back for more, after all. They were also bright, snappy, simple to understand, hard to master and as addictive as an experience served in small chunks can get. Sinister, evil games they were. Not like todays games relying on DLCs, microtransactions and hype. I am being sarcastic of course.These sensibilities are mostly forgotten nowadays, and it is one reason why you may be interested in this game, to see how they games were ""back in the day"" without having to deal with 80s graphics. But they also made games fun and enjoyable. That's the only way games could get money at the time.While I cannot recommend this game wholeheartedly, the gameplay is archaic and doesn't have a lot of variety, I do believe that the game at least deserves a try."

You're just gonna have to experience that yourself.But it's really smooth and well made.
