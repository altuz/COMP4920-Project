A few nights ago i thought to myself, ""wouldnt it be cool if this game i used to play was on steam, and was multiplayer?"" I then decided to search it up on steam, and there it was! Multiplayer too! Tons of content in this game, alot more than the app, with 13 worlds, around 10 level per world, and literally a dozen new features added. Although the game gets very difficult sometimes, and i find the AI are very prone to attack you rather than each other a good 80% of the time, making you weaker so now the other AI attack you aswell, which is a little flawed, but makes the game tricky. Would recommend to anyone who loves a real time strategy game."

If you like strategy but dont want all the extra (and cookie-cutter from game to game) monotonus steps of building all of the huts and farms and bunkers, this game is perfect.Everyone starts out with the same initial units and has the same rate of production that constantly churns out your units, you only get stronger by sending units to take other planets, or investing them in upgrading select planets (plus a few strategic mode options) Simple.So much so that the single player mode can feel easy to complete at FIRST. Then you get to the ""insane"" levels. These are very challenging maps that will require thinking outside of the box (or obit?!?!?) to complete. I have played this on the mobile app and have beaten all but 3 of the maps and those three are keeping me insanely playing this game trying to beat them!The part about this game that i've enjoyed the most is the multiplayer, which VERY sadly needs more of you to realize how awesome this game is. The strategies you've learned to manipulate and win against the AI of single player now go out the window and all of the excitement is renewed!!!!... as long as there's actually somone on to play.... Seriously, there is so much potential here that hasn't been discovered that my eyes are watering a little bit as I type this. Check it out!!!!!"

I have it on both steam and Android, and it was completely worth it.  So many cool challenges, and so much time spent enjoying playing this game.  It has *tons* of really fun maps and interesting twists and I highly recommend it to anyone remotely interested in it."

I have changed it to a positive review. It is worth at least a few hours of entertainment, just really wish they wouldve created something Spectacular ^.^------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It is the same exact game as the first one. With a slight graphical side-grade..... Hardly any ACTUALLY new maps unless you want to spend dozens of retries if not more on the insane maps... (which are really only hard because of the negative placement of your start) - the only difficulty programmed into in this game is when you start at a large disadvantage while having to 2v1 or 3v1 sometimes. That IS the Only difficulty programmed into this game.I would give a thumbs up if they had actually created a $20 game instead of this $10 copy of the first. I would not say this game is worth the money sadly, considering everything is just about the same as the first with some environmental effects thrown in. Just wish they wouldve really taken the time to Develop an amazing full content game."

I cant even play it, even when i download it.Don't download. It will crash every time you open it.And if you manage to get in, you will be stopped by a EXCEPTION_VIOLATION crash. This is just, i absolutely HATE IT. The mobile version, give that a yes. This, NOPE."

However, it is a tad bit ridiculous when the so-called ""hard"" levels are set to an impossible level and the ""insane"" rounds are completely and unrealistically unpassable. It's only fun until you reach the constellations that you are repeatedly doing numerous different ways and getting the same result: defeat. What's the point of the game if you can't beat the ""insane"" levels after ten or twelve tries? I realize they are suppose to be challenging, but come on! This is just insanely ridiculous. It's a slap in the face of your users. I would recommend this game to other players, but with an err of caution."

The 'insane' levels can be challenging, but most of them just♥♥♥♥♥♥you off. Theres usually only 1 way to beat it and that takes hours of bashing your controls in frustration of seeing the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t tactics from the CPU over and over. The biggest challenge in this game is controlling your units. Dont expect much from this game that was appearantly designed for smartphones."

,Not Recommended,444130,29487513,Posted: 25 January,all,𝓛𝓟𝓒𝓱𝓲𝓹,"I got this game for my phone and I was thrilled. The concept is awesome and I just had to get it for the pc too.My god, what a disappointment.From day one, the music is broken, and support is nowhere around, so this will never get fixed. The controls for the android version are brilliant, but they lack in the PC version. Yes, there are some alternate ways to have the same controls, but with a mouse it just doesn't work. How often I lose simply because the game is not responding because I accidentally hover my mouse above a planet, which is worse in the fog levels because I can't even see that I am hovering a planet, yet my commands are not carried out and thus I loose due to a silly mistake.The levels are not balanced properly. Some levels are classified as hard but they are medium. Other levels are classified as medium and are definitely hard.The game has some funny mechanics but at the same time I dislike the game for it. For example, the gamma rays: I have no idea how to beat the levels and even medium levels I can't beat.Multiplayer is dead too. Everyone else already figured out this game is dead.Would I recommend this game to anyone? Most definitely not."
76561198045575537,Recommended,444130,29936181,Posted: 14 February,all,brandonwlane,The game installer seems to omit a crucial file to get the game to run. I had to manually go into my steam and copy a .dll file into the main folder to get the game to run. After running it black screens until i alt tab and close a sound error. After all that nonsense it works fine and is great. but probably fix these issues.
